   Mutinous military cadets in Azerbaijan fired on
Soviet troops patrolling their capital Sunday, and tens of
thousands of people mourned victims of a bloody crackdown on their
republic's nationalist uprising.
   A general strike was called for Monday to protest Soviet troop
presence, said a political scientist speaking by telephone from
Baku, the Azerbaijani capital where the fighting was reported. It
was not immediately clear who called the strike.
   The dozens of cadets, joined by comrades from the neighboring
Caucasus republic of Georgia, battled sporadically Sunday with
Soviet soldiers at Baku's garrison and military academy, reported
Arif Yunusov, a member of the Azerbaijani Social Democratic Group.
   The downtown garrison was the scene of some of the fiercest
fighting when thousands of Soviet troops Saturday broke through
barricades erected by militants and stormed Baku, the southern
republic's capital.
   The political scientist, Jahun Mulazade, who teaches at the
Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences, said from his apartment Sunday
night that he could hear shooting at the garrison. He estimated
about 200 Azerbaijani cadets, 50 Georgians and members of other
ethnic groups were fighting the soldiers.
   Early Monday, Mulazade reported scattered gunfire but that
Soviet military forces generally appeared to ``control the
situation in Baku.''
   Mutinous Azerbaijani sailors also reportedly exchanged gunfire
with Soviet troops on Sunday. Mulazade and Yunusov's wife, Leila,
said that battle raged at the naval academy on the outskirts of
Baku.
   Occasional shots rang out elsewhere in the Azerbaijani capital
Sunday, Yunusov and Radio Moscow said, but it appeared that
fighting was concentrated at military posts.
   Rebels threw grenades and Molotov cocktails at soldiers'
military vehicles, the official news agency Tass said. A
correspondent for Moscow's state-run TV and radio service was
briefly held hostage.
   The Interior Ministry reported 51 civilians and six soldiers
dead, and 287 civilians and 36 soldiers wounded in Saturday's
action. That brought the total number of casualties for the week to
129 dead and more than 500 wounded.
   Activists reported much higher figures, and Interior Ministry
officials said they received too many conflicting accounts to
confidently update their figures.
   Foreign reporters were barred from Armenia and Azerbaijan, so it
was difficult to reconcile the conflicting information.
   Moscow sent thousands of troops and other forces to Baku after
fighting flared between the Moslem Azerbaijanis and mainly
Christian Armenians this month. The neighboring republics are
locked in a decades-old dispute over the region of
Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inside Azerbaijan but populated mainly
by Armenians.
   The total number of Soviet forces tackling the violence is
reported to be 29,000, including troops, police, cadets and
interior forces. The number of militants has been reported to be in
the thousands.
   The bloodiest wave of violence erupted Jan. 13 with
anti-Armenian rioting in Baku that killed 67 people by official
count and forced thousands of Armenians to abandon their homes. It
escalated into open warfare elsewhere in Azerbaijan and led to the
worst fighting in the ethnic feud in two years.
   A tabloid TV newscast called ``Seven Days'' began a 25-minute
wrapup of the week's ethnic violence Sunday night with red lines
spreading from the top of the screen, simulating dripping blood, as
pictures of soldiers and victims of the violence flashed by.
   Anchorman Eduard M. Sagalayev told millions of viewers the
ethnic warfare was the Soviet Union's biggest tragedy since World
War II.
   Tens of thousands of Azerbaijanis gathered outside the Communist
Party headquarters in Baku to mourn those killed when Soviet troops
moved in, Yunusov said.
   They also demanded that the state of emergency imposed in the
capital early Saturday be lifted and that Soviet troops pull out,
according to the Azerbaijan's People's Front, which has organized
anti-Armenian protests.
   Baku's city council made identical demands.
   The republic's Supreme Soviet convened an emergency meeting late
Sunday night and was to remain in session until Monday morning,
said Namida Vitulova, whose husband, Yusif Samedogly, attended.
   She and Mulazade said they expected the legislature to show its
anger over the crackdown by considering secession.
   Azerbaijan's premier, Ayaz Mutalibov, said in a Baku Radio
broadcast he met Saturday with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and discussed what steps were required for troops to be
withdrawn.
   In the address, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in
London, Mutalibov did not elaborate but said: ``We were promised
that provocations will be prevented in Azerbaijan's districts
bordering Armenia.''
   He appealed to his countrymen ``to save our people from
disaster'' by restoring law and order.
   Residents said flags with black mourning ribbons were draped on
cars, balconies and windows throughout the city, which was in the
middle of three days of officially declared mourning. A mass
funeral was scheduled Monday.
   Mulazade said the road to Baku's airport, strewn with corpses
after the Soviet troops stormed through, was covered with flowers.
   Soldiers continued to patrol the Caspian Sea port of 1.8 million
people in armored personnel carriers.
   The Interior Ministry in Moscow said extremists massed on a dock
in Baku near the tanker Ivan Zemnukhov and threatened to blow up
the ship unless Soviet troops were withdrawn from the capital.
   Ali Asker, a People's Front member in Baku, said in a telephone
interview that workers aboard oil tankers and other ships anchored
in Baku's port threatened to set fire to their vessels unless
troops were withdrawn.
   The seamen also threatened to ignite oil facilities, Asker said.
The threat could not be immediately confirmed.
   In Moscow, thousands of Azerbaijanis, many wearing black
armbands and waving black flags of mourning, marched to the
headquarters of the official Tass news agency. They claimed
official news coverage of the events in their republic was
distorted, and they carried signs critical of Gorbachev.
   Hundreds of Armenians gathered at a small brick church and
cemetery in Moscow to mourn their dead. Volunteers sat a table on
the snow-covered sidewalk outside the church to collect donations
for the 15,000 Armenian refugees who fled Baku, and demonstrators
held protest signs, including one that blamed Moscow for the deaths.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said two helicopters Sunday
flew over barricades erected by residents of the Soviet border city
of Lenkoran and fired at a crowd.
   IRNA said a provincial Soviet television station that broadcast
a declaration of independence from Moscow was knocked off the air,
apparently by a powerful explosion.
   Iran reiterated its call on the Soviet Union to stop the
``violent clashes'' with Moslems in neighboring Azerbaijan, IRNA
said.
   Tass said Armenians fired at an Azerbaijani village in an area
called Wolf's Gate on the border between the two republics, killing
12 civilians before troops stepped in. The dispatch did not say
when the attack occurred.
   On Saturday, it said, people attacked an anti-aircraft and
missile unit near the Armenian capital, Yerevan, but that
government forces repulsed them.
   On Monday, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported talks in
Yerevan aimed at seeking an end to hostility between the rival
ethnic groups and an exchange of hostages held by both sides.

<HEAD>One-Day Car Ban Changes Milan's Look, Improves Air Quality</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Milanese breathed easier and turned to
unusual means of transportation after authorities ordered a one-day
ban on private cars.
   Bicycles, skateboards and roller skates replaced cars on the
streets of Italy's business capital on Sunday as private traffic
was banned between 9:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. to combat air pollution.
   The region's 300 electric car owners met downtown with their
vehicles, while part of the police went on horseback.
   Authorities in the city of 3 million people doubled the number
of buses and streetcars and tripled the number of subway trains
usually in use on Sundays.
   ``I think the citizens took it well,'' Mayor Paolo Pillitteri
told reporters. ``Maybe a Sunday spent differently will make people
think about what's happening to our city.''
   It was the longest ban on cars in Italy since driving was
forbidden throughout the country on holidays at the height of the
oil crisis in 1973.
   Dry, windless weather has increased air pollution across
northern Italy. In the most polluted areas of Milan, carbon
monoxide readings reached dangerous levels on Saturday.
   City officials said they might repeat Sunday's ban or take other
measures if air pollution remains at alarming levels.

   A freighter carrying petroleum coke collided
with a tugboat Sunday off Delaware, damaging both vessels and
injuring two people, the Coast Guard said.
   Authorities said there was no indication any of the coke spilled
into the Atlantic Ocean.
   The 593-foot freighter Doo Yang Leader and the 113-foot tug
Socrates collided around 6:30 p.m. 35 miles due east of Cape
Henlopen in southern Delaware, Coast Guard spokesman Breck Smith
said in Philadelphia.
   The freighter stopped because it had a ruptured tank believed to
be leaking engine fuel, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Richard
Minnich.
   ``When they noticed the leak, they transfered that fuel back to
another tank,'' Minnich said.
   ``There's a one-meter hole on the starboard side. The hole is
above the waterline,'' said James Graham, a spokesman for the Coast
Guards's 5th District headquarters in Portsmouth, Va.
   The ship was carrying petroleum coke, a residue from a process
that breaks down petroleum products. The freighter is owned by Doo
Yang Shipping Lines in South Korea.
   Investigators from the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office in
Philadelphia were dispatched to the collision site.
   Graham said the Coast Guard cutter Point Franklin, with
emergency medical technicians aboard, was in the area and was en
route to the tug to assist one of the injured, but said the injury
didn't appear to be life-threatening.
   He said authorities believe the other man had a back injury, and
did not require major medical attention.
   The tug was towing a 300-foot barge of sugar from West Palm
Beach, Fla. to Yonkers, N.Y., just north of New York City.
   The tug is owned by Allied Towing Corp. of Norfolk, Va., Minnich
said.
   Minnich said the tug received damage to its cabin, but was able
to continue on its route and was being accompanied by another tug
owned by the same company.
   Neither ship lost any of its cargo, Graham said.

   A sign on a freeway here reads
``Little Saigon,'' marking an enclave that is home to many of the
250,000 Vietnamese settled in Southern California.
   Now the region is receiving the first wave of 100,000 political
prisoners allowed to leave Vietnam, and experts are calling on
Vietnamese-Americans to help the refugees survive and thrive in
America as government funding dwindles.
   ``My argument to them is look, you've been helped by the
American government, the American people and others,'' said Loc
Nguyen, director of the refugee resettlement program for the
Catholic Charities of Los Angeles.
   ``You keep pushing the government to allow more refugees, and
say we need more help. I say they are our people. ... We have to
take care of them,'' said Nguyen.
   The refugees themselves are cautioned about economic realities.
   ``We explain to them that real life in the United States does
not look like on television,'' said Rev. Bao Xuan Nguyen of the
Saigon Christian Reformed Church in Westminster. ``I ask them, come
back with a realistic view. ... If they want to build their own
life, everything must start at the beginning.''
   The Vietnamese community in Los Angeles is estimated at 150,000,
and at up to 100,000 in adjacent Orange County, officials say, the
largest concentration outside Vietnam.
   About 7,000 prisoners of communist Vietnam's ``re-education''
camps _ some of whom spent more than a decade imprisoned after the
war's end _ are expected to be resettled by September.
   Of the total 100,000 or so eligible to emigrate to the United
States in the next five years, most are expected to settle in
Southern California, said William Gayk, demographer for Orange
County.
   Texas, Florida and Washington, D.C., also have large Vietnamese
populations, Gayk said.
   The amount of federal money available for an individual's
resettlement in 1983 was $12,000, according to Dianne Edwards,
director of adult and employment services for the Orange County
Social Services Agency. In 1989, it was less than $4,000, she said.
   There are government programs in place to help such refugees as
the former political prisoners, she said, including cash
assistance, medical aid and language and job training.
   ``We are not anticipating a major drain on county resources as a
result of the former POWs,'' she said. ``The issue we are seeking
to address is that refugee funding has gone down considerably in
the last 10 years.''
   Leaders in the Vietnamese community say the decline in funding
presents an opportunity to unite in support of their newly arriving
countrymen.
   ``The local and federal government has been doing a lot of work
to resettle the refugees. We feel we should do our part,'' said
Tony Lam, a businessman who has been active in refugee resettlement
in Orange County since his arrival 15 years ago.
   The Rev. Nguyen is working to enlist even recent refugees in the
cause.
   ``I say, `You wanted me to sponsor you, how about when you have
a stable life, you sponsor others,''' Nguyen tells his
parishioners. ``Do for them what people did for you.''
   Those involved in resettlement agree that a number of the former
prisoners _ many of whom were military officers who fought for
South Vietnam against the communists and politicians _ are arriving
with advantages their predecessors lacked.
   ``This group is the easiest to work with,'' said Loc Nguyen of
Catholic Charities, which handles up to 40 percent of the total
Vietnamese refugee caseload in Los Angeles and works under an
agreement with the State Department, as do a dozen other volunteer
agencies.
   ``They have an above-average education, and often are
college-educated. Their English is much better than other groups.
They may have been government or military officials, or been
associated with U.S. firms,'' he said.
   Loc Nguyen and others said the refugees need help adjusting to a
lower standard of living than they might have expected here, and
the limits of public assistance.
   That might mean a man who was an engineer or high-ranking
military officer in Vietnam will have to start out here as a
minimum-wage assembly line worker, he said.
   Loc Nguyen said he encourages refugees to take such jobs while
educating themselves for more skilled positions, so they can stay
off welfare.
   ``I tell them with welfare you lose your confidence, you lose
your energy. You become merely a welfare receiver who waits for the
check,'' he said.

<HEAD>Quayle Faces Possible Chilly Reception on Latin American Trip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle, facing a possible
chilly reception in Latin America as he offers to explain the U.S.
invasion of Panama, would not be the first presidential emissary to
run into trouble in the region.
   Such esteemed former Latin America travelers as Nelson
Rockefeller, Richard Nixon and Rosalynn Carter were sent by
presidents on goodwill trips and all encountered stormy receptions
_ in some cases violence.
   Quayle leaves Saturday on a mission to try to quell the
resentment left in Central and South America by President Bush's
Dec. 20 military invasion of Panama.
   None of the countries in the region has officially rebuffed
Quayle, but some officials have let it be known his visit would be
less than welcome so soon after the invasion. Many are upset that
U.S. invasion troops remain in Panama.
   Instead of receiving Quayle at home, some leaders plan to meet
with him at three presidential inaugurations _ on Saturday in
Honduras, and in Chile and Brazil in mid-March.
   Quayle himself acknowledged ``there's a matter of timing''
involving ``diplomatic sensitivities'' over when he should go.
   Past efforts by Washington to be chummy with Latin America have
encountered problems stemming from a variety of sources, including
Latin resentment over the historical U.S. pattern of manipulating
the region's internal political and economic affairs.
   The most volatile trips in recent history were that of Vice
President Richard Nixon in 1958 and a series of trips by New York
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller in 1969.
   In contrast to those times, when most of the region was under
dictatorship and military rule, Quayle will visit a region that has
turned overwhelmingly to democratic government.
   On an 18-day goodwill mission for President Eisenhower, Nixon
was the target of violent, anti-U.S. demonstrations in Peru and
Venezuela, and lesser outbursts and heckling by university students
in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Colombia.
   Rock-throwing mobs confronted Nixon in Lima and Caracas. Rioters
shattered the windows of his limousine in Caracas and tried to drag
him and his wife from the car before their motorcade managed to
escape.
   Eisenhower ordered U.S. military troops to stand by in Puerto
Rico and the Guantanamo Bay base in Cuba in case Nixon needed
protection.
   In Lima, shouting demonstrators threw rocks and fruit at his
speaker's platform. In Bogota, police broke up several anti-Nixon
demonstrations.
   When Nixon became president, he dispatched Rockefeller to help
formulate a new policy toward Latin America.
   Voicing sentiments much like those stated by Bush in the first
year of his presidency, Nixon talked about the region's importance
and U.S. hopes for cooperative ties with its hemispheric neighbors.
   But Rockefeller's mission was marked at nearly every stop by
violence _ riots, bombings, gunfights or terrorism. Eight people
were killed in incidents directly or indirectly connected to the
visit.
   The first trouble signs came in Guatemala where newspapers
blasted his visit as useless, and in El Salvador where placards
read ``Rockefeller go home.''
   In Nicaragua, students burned a U.S. flag. Peru then canceled
Rockefeller's trip to Lima, annoyed that the United States had
suspended arms sales to Peru following seizures of U.S. fishing
boats.
   Following violence in Ecuador, Colombia and Honduras, word came
that Venezuela and Chile wanted to be stricken from Rockefeller's
itinerary.
   In Montevideo, Uruguay, rampaging students, protesting both
Rockefeller's visit and their government's economic austerity
program, smashed car windows and threw firebombs.
   After returning home, Rockefeller submitted to Nixon 83
recommendations on how to improve hemispheric cooperation and help
solve the region's social, political and economic problems.
   All but a few were ignored.
   When Rosalynn Carter toured seven nations as her husband's
emissary on a 13-day trip in 1977, the dissension was mostly less
overt.
   But students in Quito, Ecuador, threw stones and bricks and
shouted anti-American slogans near where she met with government
officials. The noise at times nearly drowned out her voice in the
Legislative Palace.
   Elsewhere on her tour, there were private diplomatic rumblings,
complaining that Carter had sent his wife rather than a
high-ranking official who would have more appropriate stature to
conduct diplomatic talks.
   In Brazil, Mrs. Carter trod on delicate ground by raising the
Carter administration's unhappiness with the military government's
human rights record, and ruffled feathers by announcing she would
meet there with two American churchmen who had reportedly been
beaten by police.

play with her brown-eyed friends at recess.
   She and the other blue-eyed third graders had to drink from a
fountain with warm water, use a restroom without paper towels, and
stand in the back of lines.
   It was part of a first-hand lesson in discrimination devised by
faculty at Driscoll Elementary School to teach 60 third-graders the
meaning of discrimination, as part of the celebration of Martin
Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
   ``I had this one friend who had blue eyes, and she started
crying because she didn't know what was happening,'' Amber said
Sunday.
   Blue-eyed children were snubbed one day in the program that
began Jan. 9; those with brown eyes and those with hazel and green
eyes were discriminated against on subsequent days.
   Some children were upset at their separation from friends and
classmates for a day, teacher Cathy Pedersen said, but she hopes
they learned the lesson.
   ``The goal really was to get them to understand just how unfair
prejudice is. .. I wanted them to say, `This is unfair. I can't
help the way I was born.' If they can grow up without prejudice,
they can carry that on with their children,'' she said.

<HEAD>Government Sponsors Songs to Dampen Third World Sex</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In languages from West African pidgin English
to the Tagalog of the Philippines, popular music financed by the
U.S. government aims at discouraging young people from having sex.
   Critics have long complained that many pop songs promote sex,
but the songs commissioned by the U.S. Agency for International
Development seek to do the reverse.
   ``Wait for Me,'' the title song of a best-selling album in
Nigeria last year, says in pidgin English:
   ``Dis tin them call love
   ``Na serious affair,
   ``Make you think well
   ``Before you gree.''
   Translation: ``This thing they call love is a serious affair.
Think well before you agree.''
   The song was recorded by King Sunny Ade, known in West Africa
for a style called ju-ju, and Onyeku Onwenu. He has three wives and
12 children. She is a graduate of Wellesley College who tried
journalism before turning to the stage. The agency said she wrote
both music and lyrics, in pidgin and traditional English.
   Another song, ``Choices,'' presents an alternative policy:
   ``Yes we shouldn't make children
   ``We cannot take care of
   ``There are ways of making love
   ``Without making children.''
   Many people who work to raise the living standards of poor
countries see the rapid growth of their population as the chief
obstacle.
   ``Growth rates in developing countries will remain high for
several decades even if couples have fewer children,'' said a study
by the World Bank, the chief source of aid for the Third World.
   ``Absolute annual increases will be close to ... 80 million
people a year ... well into the next century.''
   The U.S. agency's population program also provides donations of
contraceptives, including 6.9 billion condoms over the past two
decades.
   The Nigerian album's popularity has spilled over into
neighboring countries. The next step will be another record for
nearby French-speaking republics like Zaire, Senegal and the Ivory
Coast, the agency says.
   The agency said it was too early to say what effect the African
music has had, but a study will be made later.
   Two songs recorded earlier for Latin America were the subject of
an analysis by the Population Communication Service of Johns
Hopkins University. The idea for the project came from a conference
of the service in 1983.
   With the government agency's support it blossomed into two
musical videos, television commercials, radio spots, records and
jackets, posters and press materials. The songs were recorded by
Tatiana Palacios of Mexico and Johnny Lozada Correa of Puerto Rico.
   The agency said the songs topped the charts in Mexico and Peru
and reached the top 10 in nine other countries.
   ``We made an investment of about $350,000 and got about $5
million worth of free air time,'' said Duff Gillespie, the agency's
director for population.
   The university's study said that although no data were
collected, attitudes about delaying sexual relations may have been
strengthened, especially among young women in Mexico.
   ``One of the most important conclusions from this evaluation is
that popular songs and the broadcast media can be successfully
employed to reach young people with a positive social message about
sexual responsibility, even if the message contradicts the theme of
the majority of competing popular songs,'' it added.
   In the Philippines one song was called ``I Still Believe'' and
Lea Salonga sang in English:
   ``I don't think it's right to need me
   ``Just for a lonely night.''
   To which, according to the agency, Charlie Masso replied in
Tagalog:
   ``I'm willing to wait for a while.''
   The song was number one in the Philippine charts for two months,
the agency said.

   A chartered fishing boat with nine people
aboard capsized and broke up in 15-foot swells in a river's mouth
Sunday, leaving one person dead and six people missing, Coast Guard
officials said.
   The 45-foot Gambler capsized around 4 p.m. while crossing a
sandbar in the mouth of the Quillayute River as it headed for the
harbor of this village by the Pacific Ocean, the Coast Guard said.
   A Coast Guard helicopter plucked three people from the water,
but one was dead on arrival at Forks Community Hospital, officials
said.
   Jerry Wilson and Ron Wilson, both in their 20s and both of
Aberdeen, were listed in stable condition at the hospital, said
hospital nursing supervisor Barbara Enos.
   The name of the person who died was not released pending
notification of relatives.
   A 44-foot Coast Guard motor lifeboat from LaPush searched
through heavy fog Sunday night for possible survivors or bodies in
the water, Chief Petty Officer Dave Edwards said in a telephone
interview from the Quillayute River Coast Guard Station.
   The helicopter also searched but returned to Port Angeles 80
miles east of LaPush after running low on fuel.
   The Clallam County sheriff's office sent a 10-member search and
rescue team to LaPush to search the beach, said sheriff's
communications officer Bill Logan.
   The entrance to LaPush's harbor is a narrow waterway at the
mouth of the Quillayute.
   The Gambler was from Tacoma, but has been moored lately in
LaPush, Edwards said.

<HEAD>Weicker Considers Comeback as He Builds Research Organization</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Research! America in 2nd graf is cq</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dome of his former haunt, the U.S.
Capitol, looms seven miles up the Potomac River as Lowell Weicker,
his 6-foot-5-inch frame a little thinner than when he patrolled the
Senate, ponders returning to politics.
   Weicker, the Nixon antagonist and maverick Republican from
Connecticut, has dropped off the radar screen of politics in the
year since his upset loss to Democrat Joseph Lieberman.
   He has been quietly building a public outreach group, Research!
America, an association of universities, hospitals and
philanthropies devoted to promoting biomedical research, where his
job is ``to sell the priority of biomedical research to the
American people in the same way you sell a hamburger or a can of
beer.''
   But the 58-year-old millionaire says he misses the political
battlefield and is considering a run for governor of Connecticut.
   ``One could compare Research! America to Elba if one wanted
to,'' said Dick Foley, the Connecticut GOP chief and no supporter
of Weicker, referring to the island where Napoleon was exiled.
   Weicker says he never wanted to use Research! America as a
platform for political self-promotion. But as he considers
returning to politics, the organization is preparing a media blitz
featuring Weicker that will promote research for cures for such
diseases as multiple sclerosis and cystic fibrosis.
   Weicker closes out each of the TV ads by saying, ``To me, it's
outrageous that a country as prosperous as America doesn't spend
more on medical research.''
   The organization has a $1 million budget this year and hopes to
triple that figure within three years through contributions from
its member organizations.
   ``The big part of our budget is going to be advertising,''
Weicker says.
   In the meantime, Weicker says he misses the political fray and
predicts he could win the state's top office. But he is also
realistic.
   ``The last time I asked Connecticut, `How am I doing?' I didn't
get a very good answer,''' Weicker said.
   The speculation about Weicker has been fueled by the absence of
any declared candidates of statewide stature. Incumbent Democratic
Gov. William O'Neill has yet to decide whether he wants another
term, and other potential contenders are either regional
politicians or businessmen.
   Weicker, who inherited a fortune from his grandfather's
pharmaceutical business, says he could easily stay where he is. He
spends more time with his family, has a nice view of the Potomac
and doesn't have to attend late night Senate sessions. In fact, he
has hardly been on Capitol Hill since losing his seat.
   ``When I accepted the job for Research America, I made it very
clear that I would not lobby, period,'' Weicker said. ``When I was
in the Senate, I used to really look with disdain ... on my
ex-colleagues who used to lurk in the dining room and gymnasium and
the halls doing their thing.''
   Even if he did lobby the Senate, Weicker wonders whether he
would have much impact. His outspoken, often undiplomatic style,
which first gained prominence during the Watergate hearings when he
lambasted President Nixon for what he viewed as that
administration's abuse of the Constitution, frequently earned him
enemies.
   Nevertheless, Weicker says he doesn't plan to change his manner,
even though he has little doubt it cost him his Senate seat.
   ``The approach stays the same,'' he says.
   ``We'd all like to go ahead and call the manner of our leaving,
whether it's the Senate or it's the earth,'' Weicker said. ``Would
I have preferred to have retired undefeated from the Senate? Sure,
nobody likes to get beat. But you don't run the risks that I ran on
a variety of issues without understanding that somewhere along the
line you're going to catch a bullet.''

<HEAD>Excerpts From DC Mayor's Public Statement on Treatment Plans</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Barry, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from Mayor Marion Barry's
statement to reporters Sunday in the wake of his arrest last week
on drug charges:
   ``The events of the past few days have been the most difficult
of my life. More difficult than fighting my way out of poverty as
black youth, born in the segregated Deep South. More difficult than
the fear and hatred I faced as a civil rights leader in the 1960s.
More difficult than I could have imagined.
   ``Because this time I have come face to face with my deepest
human frailties. I've had to look my human weaknesses straight in
the eye. I have realized that I've spent so much time caring about
and worrying about and doing for others. I have not worried enough
or cared enough for myself. ...
   ``I have realized that God made Marion Barry the same as he made
other people, a flesh and blood creation, who rises and falls just
like any other human being.
   ``I've just spent the last hour or so with a group of clergy
people, including my own minister, David Eaton, who are friends of
mine. We have prayed and they have counseled me. And I have taken
their counsel.
   ``It helped me feel good about the fact that in the final
analysis, it's not the title that a person holds that's important,
it's not Marion Barry mayor that counts, it's Marion Barry the
person _ a human being with a body, mind and spirit like any other
person.
   ``I've felt for some time that I could do any and everything.
But they have helped me to realize that God put each of us on earth
for a purpose. We may not always understand what that purpose, but
when we put ourselves in God's hands, our way is made clearer.
   ``These ministers have helped me keep the strength that I need.
   ``So I announce today I am going to find a way to begin to heal
my body, mind and soul.
   ``To all the people who love me and worry about me, the best way
to show your appreciation for me and our city and our family is to
join together as a united community. We must at this hour be
willing to forgive, to love, to reach out to each other and to
serve our city.
   ``I realize that I am going to have to walk this journey by
myself. It's going to take Marion Barry walking this journey. But I
say to others who are pained and hurt as I am _ join me, brothers
and sisters. We can make it. We can make it. We will make it. It's
going to be a lonely journey. But I stand, and God stands with me.''

<HEAD>Foley Declines to Endorse Social Security Tax Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Democratic plan to cut the Social Security
payroll tax poses a problem because it would increase the federal
deficit, says House Speaker Thomas S. Foley.
   Foley, D-Wash., said he probably would oppose the plan by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., if he had to make an immediate
decision on it. The Bush administration opposes the proposal.
   ``I wouldn't be ready to say that I was in favor of it today,''
Foley, D-Wash., said Sunday, appearing on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press.'' ``If I had to make a decision today to do it or not do it,
I'd probably say don't do it.''
   Moynihan's plan is aimed at keeping the surpluses generated by
the Social Security system from artificially lowering the federal
deficit. The Social Security system made $52 billion more last year
than it paid out, allowing the government to report a $152 billion
deficit rather than a $204 billion shortfall.
   ``Rightly or wrongly, these funds are used to meet the costs of
the deficit, or part of them, and we'd have a problem if we cut the
tax, of having a very large increase in the federal deficit,''
Foley said.
   Other Democrats, though taking pleasure in the way Moynihan's
politically appealing tax cut has put Republicans on the defensive,
have also voiced reservations about what effect it would have on
the nation's deficit.
   Moynihan, appearing on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,'' said he
didn't know why so few Democrats had endorsed his plan.
   ``If we can't get behind an issue like this, a principle, I'm
not sure who needs the Democratic Party.'' he said. ``If we won't
protect the integrity of the trust funds, well, what are we?''
   Moynihan's plan could provide 111 million working Americans with
a tax cut of up to $600 a year. It would benefit lower- and
middle-income Americans most of all, since the payroll tax does not
apply to earnings above $51,300.
   Foley said he thought it was wrong for the surplus to be used to
mask the deficit, but he did not want to endanger Social Security
benefits for future retirees.
   ``I'm not ready to oppose it. I think we ought to study it very
carefully,'' Foley said.
   The speaker noted it took Congress more than a year's work
before it agreed on a way to strengthen the system's financial
structure in 1983.
   ``We shouldn't go running around changing it dramatically
without time to examine the alternatives,'' Foley said.
   Foley had been silent on the issue before Sunday. Other key
players in revenue legislation who have not been heard from are
Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and House Ways and
Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, reiterated
Sunday that he is undecided on Moynihan's plan and is awaiting
studies about how it would affect the deficit.
   Mitchell, appearing on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' said Moynihan's plan was significant because it exposed
how ``unfair and regressive'' the American tax system had become.
   President Bush is pushing for a cut in the capital gains tax,
which is seen by many Democrats as benefiting only the rich.
Supporters say it would stimulate much-needed investment.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., appearing with
Mitchell, predicted the Moynihan plan is ``not going anywhere.''
   Budget Director Richard Darman, also appearing on the ABC
program, said Congress should be more concerned with lowering the
nation's $3 trillion debt than cutting the Social Security tax.
   ``Senator Moynihan has, in effect, thrown a grenade into the
middle of the House and Senate,'' Darman said.
   Moynihan's plan would cut the 7.65 percent payroll tax _ paid
separately by workers and their employers _ by 0.14 percent
immediately and by 0.96 percent more next January. The tax would
begin to rise again in the year 2015 so the Social Security system
could begin building up a reserve to pay for the 75 million baby
boomers who will begin to retire at around that time.

   Unlike his second wife, Lee Iacocca's third
bride-to-be won't need any cooking lessons from the mother of the
Chrysler Corp. chief. Darrien Earle is a gourmet.
   The pair announced their engagement Thursday, but have not set a
date for the wedding _ Earle's second. Antonietta Iacocca taught
Iacocca's second wife, Peggy Johnson, to cook Italian food. The
marriage ended in 1987 after 1{ years.
   Earle, 41, studied at the prestigious Cordon Bleu cooking school
of France and owned several Mexican restaurants in the Los Angeles
area.
   Although Earle sold her restaurant interests last year, her
brother, Steve Loomis, said she still cooks at home.
   ``She's been in Italy to study food and to France and also Los
Angeles and San Francisco,'' Loomis said. ``Her kitchen looks like
a restaurant.''
   Her specialties? Tex-Mex, French and Italian.

   Polish-born Barbara Piasecka Johnson, who
has offered to save the bankrupt Polish shipyard that gave birth to
the Solidarity trade union, is still interested despite reports of
the deal's demise, an aide said.
   Mrs. Johnson, heir to the Johnson &amp; Johnson fortune, offered in
May to invest up to $100 million in the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk if
certain conditions were met. Her letter of intent set a deadline of
Dec. 31 to complete negotiations.
   John Peach, an aide to Mrs. Johnson, dismissed the deadline set
in the letter of intent: ``December 31 was just not a practical
deadline, as complicated as the deal was.''
   ``Mrs. Johnson is still very interested and enthusiastic about
the shipyard,'' Peach said Thursday in a telephone interview from
Princeton, where Mrs. Johnson lives. ``We plan to be over there as
soon as the government says, `Come on over.'''
   Poland's then-Communist government decided in October 1988 to
close the shipyard as an austerity measure.
   Mrs. Johnson's offer initially heartened the economically
distressed port city, but the enthusiasm of shipyard
representatives cooled as the details of her bid became clearer.
   She sought a 55 percent interest in the shipyard, a five-year
ban on strikes and a wage contract of 50 cents an hour, according
to Solidarity and shipyard officials.

   Ex-drug addict David Crosby is helping alcoholic
teen-age actress Drew Barrymore stay straight.
   Barrymore, 14, lived with Crosby and his wife, Jan Dance, for
three months as part of her program of recovery from alcohol and
drug abuse, according to this week's People magazine.
   ``I'm an old Hollywood kid and I knew her story. I felt she had
been dealt a short deck, you know, a fifth-generation alcoholic,
and I didn't want to see her go down the tubes,'' Crosby told
People.
   Crosby, 48, of the rock group Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, has
a well-documented history of cocaine addiction, hitting bottom in
1983 with an 11-month prison term on drug and weapons convictions.
But now he's straight.
   Barrymore, the lovable moppet of the movie ``E.T.,'' announced
last year that she had struggled with drugs and alcohol since she
was 9. When she left a clinic in October, the Crosbys took her in.
   Barrymore has rejoined her mother, Ildiko Jaid, is back in
school and is free of drugs and alcohol, People reported.

   John McEnroe, who has tried to tone
down his bad boy image in recent years, threw a tantrum at the
Australian Open and became the first player ejected from a Grand
Slam event for misconduct.
   So much for Mr. Nice Guy.
   Rattled by missed shots, close calls and a baby's cries, he
threw his racket and defaulted at a point when he was leading two
sets to one against Mikael Pernfors.
   ``If I'd known the rules, I would probably have still broken my
racket, but I probably wouldn't have said what I said to the guy,''
McEnroe said Sunday.
   The 30-year-old former champion came here determined to win his
first major tournament since the 1984 U.S. Open.
   After McEnroe smashed the court with his racket in the fourth
set, the umpire called a code violation for racket abuse. McEnroe
responded by swearing at him and asking for Ken Farrar, the Grand
Slam chief of supervisors.
   Farrar came onto the court and talked with McEnroe, but the
American continued complaining and swearing. Farrar later described
McEnroe's harangue as the most vile language he'd ever heard in a
tennis match.
   McEnroe brushed silently past reporters at the airport today and
left to fly home to California with his wife, actress Tatum O'Neal,
and their two sons.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Deficit, Eastern Europe Head Congressional
Agenda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress returns to Washington this week for a
1990 session preoccupied with two issues that have taken on an
unusual linkage: the federal budget deficit and the starkly
changing face of Eastern Europe.
   Lawmakers will be caught between a desire to reward countries
emerging from more than four decades of Soviet domination and the
need to shrink spending in an unyielding budget that already is
being asked to make room for improving programs at home.
   ``The year will be consumed with this discussion'' of how the
United States deals with a host of new relationships _ with Poland,
Hungary, East Germany, Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia _ said
Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
   Congress and President Bush will have to reach agreement on what
the U.S. role should be in encouraging and aiding those emerging
new democracies as they struggle with economic stagnation. Almost
certainly there will be a political consensus that some kind of aid
should be extended, as there was last year on aiding Poland and
Hungary.
   ``The real question will boil down to the availability of funds,
and what kind of agreement will be reached between the
administration and Congress,'' said Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla.,
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Bush has renewed his no-new-taxes vow for this year, meaning any
money for newly eligible recipients in Eastern Europe and Panama
will have to be found by cutting current programs. The aid budget
is already so tight that some U.S. friends and allies may come away
empty-handed.
   Congress will have to grapple with reducing the budget deficit
while seeking to pass legislation mandating cleaner air,
subsidizing child care for working parents, reforming campaign
finance laws, extending farm programs and stepping up the war on
drugs. There will be fights, as well, over Bush's proposal to cut
the tax rate on capital gains and over a proposal by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to cut the Social Security tax rate.
   A key to the budget battle will be how deeply defense spending
can be cut, which in turn depends heavily on progress in talks in
Vienna on a conventional arms control treaty for European forces.
All of these thorny issues will be faced in the context of an
election year. Voting will come in November for all 435 House seats
and 34 Senate seats.
   To fund new foreign aid needs overseas, Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan., has suggested trimming large aid recipients like
Israel and Egypt, which have politically potent lobbies. Many
Democrats are countering that the money should come from cuts in
Pentagon spending.
   ``We should look carefully at reducing military aid programs
premised on a communist threat orchestrated from Moscow,'' said
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.
``Economic aid to Eastern Europe is a highly effective form of
`defense' spending.''
   Others are saying the United States should be wary of promising
too much. ``We are not in the situation ... after the second World
War, when the United States was totally dominant ... and we
financed the recovery not only of our wartime allies, but our
wartime enemies,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine. ``We can't do that now, and we shouldn't do that now. It
ought to be a multilateral effort.''
   On the foreign affairs front the year will start on a discordant
note _ an attempt to override of Bush's veto last year of a bill
allowing Chinese students in the United States to extend their
stays to avoid political persecution in their homeland.
   Republicans have abandoned the president in droves on the issue,
saying he has been callous toward the bloody crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators last year.
   ``I don't think there's any chance they will be able to sustain
the president's veto,'' said Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich. ``It
would be obviously sending the wrong signal to the rest of the
world about what took place just a few months ago.''
   A House vote on the issue will come Wednesday, and the Senate is
expected to act soon afterward. The White House is putting heavy
pressure on senators to support Bush, pointing out that he has
taken administrative steps to protect the more than 30,000 students.
   Congress also will be keeping a close eye on El Salvador, where
soldiers have been charged in the murders of six Jesuit priests,
for signs that human rights violations can be dealt with by the
judicial system, and Nicaragua, where national elections are
scheduled for Feb. 25 and the campaign of the U.S.-backed
opposition coalition has been flagging.

<HEAD>Pump Prices Up Nearly Two Cents Per Gallon, Cold Weather Blamed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Gasoline prices rose nearly 2 cents per
gallon at the pump in the last two weeks, primarily because
refiners cut back on gasoline processing in favor of heating oil
during the cold weather, an analyst said.
   The average price of gasoline, including all grades and taxes,
rose 1.97 cents per gallon to 113.06 cents per gallon between Jan.
5 and Jan. 19, Trilby Lundberg said Sunday.
   ``That's the highest level since late July 1989,'' she said.
``I'm attributing this to the effect that home heating oil price
rises due to extreme cold weather had upon gasoline and other
refined petroleum products.''
   The retail gasoline prices on Jan. 19, according to the biweekly
Lundberg Survey of 13,000 gas stations:
   At self-serve stations: Premium unleaded, 118.98 cents per
gallon; regular unleaded, 101.65 cents and regular leaded, 100.19
cents.
   At full-service stations: Premium unleaded, 142.85 cents per
gallon; regular unleaded, 129.42 cents and regular leaded, 126.58
cents.

<HEAD>East Europe Revolution Could Hamper Soviet KGB, Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The revolution in Eastern Europe may weaken
but will not cripple the Kremlin's KGB spy agency, say U.S. and
emigre analysts.
   ``The KGB will have to take over functions'' now carried out by
Soviet Bloc allies, said Stanislav Levchenko, a KGB defector who
lives near Washington.
   A non-communist government has been in power in Poland since
August, while the East German, Hungarian and Romanian parties have
changed their names since hardline rulers were toppled late last
year. Also, Bulgaria's ruling Communist Party is attempting reforms.
   However, the external intelligence services of these Warsaw Pact
nations remain largely intact, and they still seem to be spying for
Moscow, say CIA chief William H. Webster and non-government
analysts.
   ``It's much too early to tell how quickly those services will
erode. My own sense is, not too quickly,'' Webster said in a speech
on Nov. 29, after hardliners in all the countries but Romania had
fallen.
   ``Some of them are ... deeply imbedded in the bureaucracies of
their countries. So let's not assume that because we are getting
friendly, and seeing freedom come up from the streets, that freedom
has been endorsed by some of those aggressive intelligence
services,'' Webster said.
   Soviet spy masters have long relied on East European
intelligence services to obtain military secrets and advanced
technology, say Western officials and Warsaw Pact defectors. The
East Europeans were not as closely watched and could travel areas
that are closed to Soviets.
   As evidence of Soviet control over Warsaw Pact
intelligence-gathering, Webster cited the cases of Army Master Sgt.
Clyde Lee Conrad, charged last August with working for Hungary at
Soviet direction, and Army Warrant Officer James W. Hall, charged
with spying for the Soviets and East Germans.
   Now experts say the East European spy agencies might capitalize
on friendlier relations with the West, particularly in their
efforts to steal advanced technologies, a major Kremlin target.
   A former chief of Romania's external intelligence, Ion Pacepa,
predicted that espionage by that nation might increase after the
ouster of Nicolae Ceausescu last month.
   ``They steal technology, and now they will steal it much more
easily, because people in the West will want to help the Romanians
and will give them technology, and they will give it to Moscow,''
Pacepa said in a telephone interview.
   Roy Godson, author of several books on intelligence, agreed that
Americans ``will tend to be much more unguarded with East
Europeans.''
   ``In the technology acquisition area, I would think that the
East Europeans would have great opportunities not only in the
United States, but in West Europe and Japan,'' he said.
   Non-Soviet Warsaw Pact intelligence agencies cooperated with the
KGB to varying degrees, according to analysts, but U.S. government
officials will not disclose much of what they know about the links.
   According to the agreement that led to Solidarity's victory in
Polish elections last year, that nation's military and intelligence
services remain in the hands of Communist Party members who were
trained in the Soviet Union.
   Czechoslovakia's Interior Ministry has been transferred out of
communist control, but it is unclear to what degree purges have
been carried out in the foreign intelligence departments or in
espionage operations abroad.
   Soviet control over these operations will erode eventually,
analysts agreed.
   The most noticeable change may be in East Germany, where the
reform government renamed the security ministry, but is now
defending its existence against angry mobs demanding an end to
domestic spying.
   Among Warsaw Pact allies, East Germany had been contributing the
most valuable information to Soviet intelligence, said Jed Snyder,
a senior research fellow at the National Strategy Information
Center.
   To take up the slack, said KGB defector Levchenko, the Soviets
must add more agents.
   ``They can expand the number in a year'' by graduating more
people from their intelligence academy, said Levchenko, a product
of that institution.
   Levchenko said that ``35 percent of every Soviet community in
every embassy are professional intelligence officers,'' and that
percentage is likely to grow.

<HEAD>Tried to Tell Them About Ceausescu, Says Rueful Ex-Ambassador</HEAD>

   If there's anyone in a position to say ``I
told you so,'' he must be David B. Funderburk who as the U.S.
ambassador to Romania kept peppering the State Department with
descriptions of Nicolae Ceausescu as an evil tyrant.
   ``It was like beating my head against a brick wall,'' he says.
   With no success at all, Funderburk struggled from 1981 to 1985
to reverse a U.S. policy that accorded special treatment toward the
Romanian dictator on the grounds that here was one communist ruler
with an independent streak.
   In an interview from his home in Buies Creek, N.C., the
45-year-old former college teacher says no one listened because the
State Department had put him down as a protege of Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., its longtime critic.
   Funderburk says George Bush, who was then vice president; former
President Nixon, ``and members of the cabinet, senators, major
businessmen all trekked over to Bucharest to do homage to
Ceausescu. I tried to convince them of the extent of the horrors of
the Ceausescu regime.
   ``But most of these officials had been told to just ignore
Funderburk and what his people at the embassy were saying. They'd
go in and praise Ceausescu to the hilt. It was very upsetting.''
   He says he even used his ties to conservatives to go around the
bureaucracy and met in 1983 with President Reagan, where he laid
out his case against doing business with Ceausescu.
   ``The president seemed sympathetic and surprised, but unless he
heard the same message day after day he wasn't about to act against
his own secretary of state,'' Funderburk says; the ``groveling''
continued.
   The policy had started in the 1970s after Ceausescu distanced
himself from Moscow on some issues. He maintained ties with West
Germany, refused to break with Israel following the Six-Day War,
refused to boycott the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles and declined to
support Soviet interference in Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan.
   The Nixon administration rewarded Romania with most favored
nation trading status. Ceausescu was courted with visits by
Presidents Nixon and Ford, a lavish welcome to Washington from
Nixon and Jimmy Carter and praise for his ``courage'' from a host
of visiting U.S. officials.
   After Reagan's election, Funderburk, who had studied the
Romanian language in college and worked in that country for the
U.S. Information Agency, pressed Helms and other Southern
conservative senators for the job in Bucharest.
   Upon arriving in Bucharest, he began warning that Ceausescu's
stance as a maverick was a sham, that ``behind the scenes he was
closely collaborating with the Soviets.''
   No one listened, he says, because of the department's distaste
for Helms.
   Career diplomat Francis B. Corry, assigned to serve as
Funderburk's deputy, agrees. The ambassador ``had three strikes
against him,'' says Corry, now retired.
   Corry says the Ceausescu policy was based on a dubious
assumption _ that Romania could be free of Soviet domination. But
reversing policy 10 years later would have given Washington ``the
moral high ground,'' but nothing else, he says. ``Ceausescu was
blackmailing us.''
   With Corry's help, Funderburk says he sent a stream of messages
to Washington detailing Ceausescu outrages.
   ``I told them that he was demolishing churches and synagogues,
that he killed pastors and priests on a regular basis,'' says
Funderburk.
   ``Ceausescu had a typewriter registration policy, a `scientific
diet' which left the people malnourished, a policy of forcing women
to have four or five babies or pay a penalty. Peasants were
executed for no crime at all _ for pilfering a few pieces of grain
because they were on the verge of starvation.
   ``But my reports weren't reaching the top people; they certainly
weren't being factored into our relations.''
   Frustrated, Funderburk quit as ambassador, wrote a book about
his experiences and ran unsuccessfully for his state's Republican
nomination to the Senate.
   Ultimately, in 1988, Congress and the administration moved
toward revoking most favored nation status for Romania.
Anticipating the rebuke, Ceausescu renounced the special status.
   Funderburk remains appalled at U.S. policy. ``We rushed in with
a new ambassador and recognized the provisional government,'' he
says. ``Most of those characters are people who worked with
Ceausescu. Here we are propping up a communist government composed
of people the people hate. We don't learn anything.''

<HEAD>Conservation Group Says Many Farmers Favor Soil-Saving Methods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Farmland Trust says soil-saving
methods of producing crops rate well among many farmers but that
there is a high degree of skepticism about tougher federal
restrictions on chemical use.
   The private, non-profit conservation group said Sunday that
``substantial numbers of farmers across the country are interested
in, and currently employing, a variety of environmentally benign,
sustainable agricultural practices.''
   But the report acknowledged that there are wide variations among
farmers, depending on the kinds of crops involved and on geographic
locations. For example, only 20 percent in one area used rotation
plans while the majority in other areas followed the soil-saving
practice.
   The project was based on personal interviews lasting for more
than an hour with 489 farmers randomly selected in five major
production areas in Butte County, Calif.; Whitman County, Wash.;
Renville County, Minn.; Livingston County, Ill.; and Dooly County,
Georgia.
   Questioners asked about methods used by the farmers in 1988, the
most recently completed crop season, including their views on the
potential environmental threats that might occur.
   The American Farmland Trust, which was founded in 1980, said it
did not design the questions or interpret results ``with any
hostility toward use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.''
   It said the study was undertaken in preparation for the 1990
farm bill debate under way in Congress. Environmental issues,
including potential hazards of agricultural chemical pollution, are
expected to have high priority.
   Over many years, report said, chemicals ``have brought great
benefits to American agriculture and consumers'' and are
``essential for financial viability'' in most farming situations
today.
   ``However, there is widespread evidence that an over-dependence
on (chemical) use has developed and much effort is today devoted to
seeking ways to enable farmers to economize on use of chemicals and
fertilizer,'' the report said.
   Last September, the National Research Council issued a 450-page
report, ``Alternative Agriculture,'' which advocated reduced use of
farm chemicals and more soil-saving practices such as crop
rotation. The NRC report recommended changes in farm policies to
help encourage the alternative methods of production.
   The NRC report has drawn criticism from some quarters on grounds
that some of its findings and recommendations were based on
inadequate research and, in some cases, one-sided assumptions.
   At its national convention in Florida recently, federation
president Dean Kleckner expressed skepticism of ``the concept of
low-input sustainable agriculture'' and alternative farming methods.
   ``Conventional agriculture, so carefully developed through a
partnership between our land-grant colleges and farmers themselves,
is indicted as inefficient and wasteful,'' he said. ``This simply
is not true.''
   The Agriculture Department was one of the sponsors of the
American Farmland Trust study, although most of the financing came
from private foundations. The USDA currently is developing LISA, or
``low-input, sustainable agriculture'' as an alternative to heavy
use of crop chemicals and other practices that jeopardize soil and
water resources.
   Some research findings show that many farmers ``apply excessive
amounts of fertilizers or pesticides because they lack adequate
information about what their fields really need or because they use
very high applications as a form of insurance,'' the report said.
   ``Moreover,'' it added, ``in some situations, the threat or
actuality of ground water or surface water pollution is high enough
that a reduction in the use of chemicals may be necessary for
health reasons.''
   Crop rotation, long recognized as a way to build up soils, was
used by a majority of the farmers in four of the five areas, with
54 percent to 82 percent employing the practice in 1988, the report
said. The exception was in Butte County, Calif., where only 20
percent of those interviewed used rotations.
   Farmers were also asked whether they followed recommendations of
fertilizer dealers or those of the federal-state cooperative
extension services.
   ``Among interviewed farmers, there were many more clients of
fertilizer dealers than there were takers of advice from (the)
cooperative extension service,'' the report said.
   Although 75 percent to 90 percent of the farmers favored changes
in USDA commodity programs that would permit planting more acres in
rotation without losing base acres used to compute federal crop
benefits, most drew the line at a regulatory crackdown on excessive
chemical use.
   One option would require farmers have an approved plan for
managing pesticide use if crop chemicals were found in their well
water. It was rejected in all five survey sites.

<HEAD>With AM-Tanker Spill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The former captain of the tanker that caused
America's worst oil spill said he's tired of being portrayed as ``a
drunken bum with a parrot on my shoulder who drove his ship
aground.''
   Joseph Hazelwood _ whose trial in Anchorage, Alaska, on charges
stemming from the March disaster is scheduled to begin Jan. 29 _
also said he has received death threats at his home in Huntington
on Long Island.
   ``I'm handling infamy reasonably well,'' the Exxon Valdez'
former skipper said in Life magazine's February issue. ``But it's
amazing how it won't go away.''
   He said Exxon Corp. has made him a scapegoat, and said he had
been surprised at the time it took to begin cleaning up the spill.
   Hazelwood, who has a history of alcohol abuse, has been accused
of drinking the night the Exxon Valdez hit a reef in Alaska's
Prince William Sound, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude
oil.
   Prosecutors also say he should have been at the helm since he
was the ship's only authorized navigator for the sound. His
attorneys say the Coast Guard relaxed the rules in 1986.
   The 43-year-old mariner faces more than seven years in prison if
convicted and $65,000 in fines. Asked if he expected he would get
justice, he replied, ``You mean like a Frank Capra movie?''
   Hazelwood, who was once Exxon's youngest tanker captain and
received two safety awards for his handling of the Valdez, told
Life he suddenly found himself depicted as ``a drunken bum with a
parrot on my shoulder who drove his ship aground or turned it over
to the cabin boy and said `Whoopee, call me when you get
somewhere.'''
   Hazelwood said he was ``flushed down the toilet in two-a-day
press conferences'' by Exxon officials trying to give the
impression ``that containment and cleanup were my responsibility as
well.''
   ``For three days, until Easter Sunday night when the wind came
up, that big puddle of oil didn't impact the shore,'' he said. ``I
was shocked by the lack of response initially. Angry and amazed.''
   Since being fired by Exxon, he has made his living lobstering
off Huntington Bay. However, having been at sea 15 of the last 20
years, he complains that he can still see the shore.
   ``These last nine months are the longest I've ever been
ashore,'' he said. ``I've always felt more comfortable at sea than
I have on land.''

   Mayor Marion Barry's admission that he needs
help following his arrest on a drug charge is ``just the
beginning,'' says his wife Effi, who promises to stand by him
during the most difficult time of his life.
   ``Marion, for you to admit to the world that you have a problem
... is truly a burden that has been lifted from our souls,'' she
said Sunday. ``Your admission of the fact that you need help is the
first step.''
   At St. Timothy's Episcopal Church hall, the mayor said he was
facing the most difficult time of his life. His wife stood beside
him, gazing at him with a pained but respectful expression.
   Frequently during the emotional event, Barry turned to his wife,
took her hand and squeezed it. With a faint smile, Mrs. Barry
patted his hand comfortingly and whispered to him.
   Following her husband's statement, Mrs. Barry announced that she
and their son Christopher, 9, would stand by him.
   ``For our family, this is just the beginning,'' she said. ``And
we ... will be with you every step of the way.''
   The tumultuous events of the past several days have been nothing
new for her. For 12 years, she has defended her husband and blasted
his critics and the media.
   Although she has complained of the strain of being the wife of
the mayor of the nation's capital, she has helped smooth the rough
spots in her husband's often controversial career.
   She has said that the best image was control. Friends and
reporters who have interviewed her frequently said her strength was
derived from spiritualism and the belief that her friends would be
there when she needed them.
   ``She knows she has a lot of friends to call on and can draw on
our strengths,'' Ruby McZier, a lawyer and good friend. ``It is a
spiritualism plus sisterhood, unspoken, but deeply felt.''
   The mayor asked the city of Washington on Sunday ``to be willing
to forgive'' him, as his wife has done many times during his tenure.
   Effi Cowell Barry, 45, married Barry in February 1978, a few
months before he was elected to his first term as mayor.
   A native of Toledo, Ohio, she was working as an environmental
health inspector at the time of their marriage, but has also been
employed as a school teacher and model.
   ``I think what gives her strength is her love for Marion and her
undying love for Christopher,'' one of the child's godparents,
Peggy Cooper Cafritz, told The Washington Post.
   ``She would lay down her life for him, whether that means
suffering, time, holding her family together against all odds or
shielding him from the public,'' said Cafritz, chairman emeritus of
the District of Columbia Commission on the Arts and Humanities.
   When Barry was arrested Thursday night in a hotel room, he was
with a woman who was cooperating with authorities. During an
interview with WRC-TV in 1987, Mrs. Barry talked about Barry's
association with other women.
   ``Since Day One, I mean, since the day we got married, he's
always been involved with other women ... so they say,'' she said.
``It's difficult. And there are _ there is _ a caliber of female in
this world ... (who) tend to gravitate towards a power figure. This
kind of involvement is a necessary nuisance that the wife of a
power figure has to deal with.''
   During the same interview, she discussed her husband's
relationship with Karen Johnson, a convicted dealer who Barry
admitted was a personal friend.
   ``He states that it was a non-intimate affair, and if he chooses
to describe it as that, I will accept it,'' she said. ``What I
blame him for is indiscretion.''

<HEAD>Career Diplomats Get Two-Thirds of Ambassadorships</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Career diplomats got two-thirds of the
ambassadorships during President Bush's first year and are likely
to receive almost all the embassy openings for the rest of his
term, the White House personnel director says.
   Charles G. Untermeyer said Sunday that despite criticism from
Democrats about ambassadorships being awarded as plums to the
Republican Party's biggest benefactors, Bush has achieved his goal
of putting diplomatic newcomers in no more than one-third of the
U.S. embassies.
   From now on, ``close to 100 percent'' of ambassadorial
appointments will go to career foreign service officers, Untermeyer
said in an interview.
   ``Henceforth, for the rest of the first Bush term, I expect
very, very few non-career nominations,'' he said.
   By Untermeyer's count, 97 of the 145 ambassadorships have gone
to career diplomats, or 67 percent. Ninety-three are already in
place, one is awaiting Senate confirmation and three are still
getting cleared before they are formally nominated.
   Forty-eight ambassadorships have gone or will go to non-career
people: 42 have been confirmed, two are awaiting Senate
confirmation and four are in the White House clearance process. One
of Bush's appointees, Ruth Washington, the ambassador to Gambia,
was killed Saturday in an auto accident in New York state.
   Untermeyer said that 10 or fewer of the non-career envoys ``were
what you could call major donors,'' including several who made the
GOP's ``Team 100'' by giving $100,000 or more to the party for the
1988 election battle. They included real estate developers Melvin
Sembler, now ambassador to Australia, and Joseph Zappala, now envoy
to Spain.
   ``Many of the non-career people are there for past proven
loyalty to George Bush,'' said Untermeyer, but their ranks include
such ``relatively poor people'' as Evelyn Teegan, a former
Republican national committeewoman from Minnesota who is now
ambassador to Fiji, and Sally Novetzke, a party activist and
longtime Bush loyalist from Iowa who is ambassador to Malta.
   Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes, D-Md., objected to several of Bush's
politically connected nominees last year and managed to block Joy
Silverman's nomination to be ambassador to Barbados. She gave
$180,000 to Republican causes before the last election.
   Untermeyer said the White House has not yet decided whether to
resubmit her nomination.
   The percentage of non-career envoys is down from roughly 40
percent at the end of the Reagan administration, said Untermeyer.
   The 33 percent goal was achieved recently when Bush nominated a
career diplomat, Edward Rowell, to be ambassador to Luxembourg,
long a post reserved for presidential pals.
   Originally, Bush nominated his chief campaign fundraiser,
Frederick Bush _ no relation _ to the Luxembourg post. But the
Senate batted that nomination back in August after Frederick Bush
came under scrutiny for contracts he received from the Reagan
administration's scandal-ridden Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   Theodore S. Wilkinson, president of the Foreign Service
Association, which represents foreign service officers, said the
non-career appointments have been ``very uneven. There's some very
good ones and some very inexperienced ones.''
   By law, Wilkinson said, even the non-career appointees are
supposed to be knowledgeable about the history, economics, politics
and language of the country they are assigned to. ``Some don't seem
to meet those criteria,'' said Wilkinson.
   With Congress returning from a two-month recess, Untermeyer said
the White House will send up 30 nominations on Tuesday.
   Some Democrats accused Bush last year of running ``a Swiss
cheese government'' and taking too long to fill vacancies.
   But Untermeyer said only 5 percent of the 659 top jobs in
Cabinet departments and independent agencies now are vacant.
   Untermeyer said 327 Bush nominees have been confirmed or
appointed; 142 jobs were filled by Reagan holdovers; 42 are
awaiting Senate confirmation; 113 are in the White House clearance
process; and 35 are vacant.

<HEAD>Justice O'Connor Stricken by Apparent Involuntary Shaking of Head</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
sometimes seems to be shaking her head involuntarily from the
bench, and although other people have noticed and mentioned it to
her, she says she is not aware of it.
   Court spokeswoman Toni House said O'Connor has not seen a doctor
about it and ``she certainly in no way believes it impedes her
ability to do her job.''
   Attorneys and others attending the court's oral argument
sessions first noticed O'Connor's head-shaking in 1985. It seems to
have become more pronounced in recent months.
   The justice answered, through her spokeswoman, several questions
posed to her by The Associated Press about the matter.
   ``She has never had it diagnosed. She is not personally aware of
any such head-shaking but she has had people tell her so,'' Ms.
House said.
   The shaking, while not constant, is noticeable when it does
occur. It is an up-and-down motion, similar to that made by someone
nodding in the affirmative.
   When asked about the shaking in 1986, O'Connor said simply that
she was unaware of it.

<HEAD>Bush to Nominate Kolstad Permanent Head of NTSB</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will end a long stalemate with
Congress over who should run the National Transportation Safety
Board when he nominates James Kolstad as chairman, a White House
official said.
   Bush will make the nomination today, Charles G. Untermeyer,
director of presidential personnel, told The Associated Press on
Sunday.
   Kolstad, a former vice president for public relations of
Frontier Airlines, has been acting chairman of the NTSB since Aug.
14, 1988, when Jim Burnett failed to win Senate approval for a
fourth two-year term as chairman.
   The agency has been struggling with a shrinking investigative
staff and a tight budget as it tries to fulfill its mandate to
learn the causes of the nation's worst accidents in the air, sea
and on land.
   One board member, Joseph Tribbe Nall, was killed Nov. 28 in a
plane crash in Caracas, Venezuela, where he had gone to give a
speech.
   The Senate failed to act last year on Bush's nomination of Susan
Coughlin to the board. Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., chairman of the
Senate aviation subcommittee, never held a hearing on her
nomination. Ford reportedly favors the Kolstad nomination.
   Untermeyer predicted that the Kolstad nomination will untie the
Coughlin nomination as well.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Alcohol, Drug Use Decline, Activism Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A study says college freshmen are becoming
more conservative about drugs and crime but more liberal about
legalized abortion, environmental issues and student activism.
   The 24th annual survey of entering college freshmen conducted
jointly by UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute and the
American Council on Education, released Sunday, found an ``abrupt
change'' in student attitudes about legalized abortions.
   Support for legalized abortion, which had remained fairly stable
_ between 53 percent and 59 percent _ since 1977, jumped sharply
between the 1988 and 1989 surveys, from 57 percent to 64.7 percent.
   ``An abrupt change in student attitudes of this magnitude in
just one year is most unusual,'' said Alexander W. Astin, professor
of higher education at UCLA's Graduate School of Education and the
survey's director. ``It may well reflect the students' growing
concern about the current Supreme Court's position on this highly
charged topic.''
   The survey found that six out of every seven of those questioned
felt `the federal government is not doing enough to control
environmental pollution.''
   And 78.2 percent of the students endorsed greater governmental
efforts to control handguns _ a new question asked for the first
time in 1989.
   Support for abolition of the death penalty continued its sharp
decline, as did student use of drugs and alcohol. The survey found
a growing tendency toward greater student activism.
   The 1989 national survey is based on the responses of 216,362
students at 403 of the nation's two- and four-year colleges and
universities. These data have been statistically adjusted to
reflect the responses of the 1.6 million first-time, full-time
students entering college as freshmen in the fall of 1989.

<HEAD>Schools, Jobs for Women Sought to Hold Down Population</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report by the Population Institute says more
schools and more jobs for women would do most to hold down massive
growth in the numbers of people in the Third World.
   The report released Sunday found a link between ignorance and
overpopulation.
   ``The population explosion is no longer a prediction. It's
already here,'' according to the institute, an advocacy group on
this issue.
   The study noted that last year the world's population increased
by over 90 million people.
   Wealthy countries like the United States have ignorant people as
well as the Third World, though they are fewer. The report said
that among people in some industrial countries, one in 10 is
``functionally illiterate,'' meaning they can read and write some
but cannot follow printed instructions or write a simple letter.
   The report said about 900 million of the world's 5.5 billion
people cannot read, and that almost two out of every three
illiterates are women.
   The study reported that women who get only one or two years of
school tend to have more surviving children rather than fewer,
suggesting that even a little education helps a mother keep her
babies alive. Women who stay at school longer get married later and
know more about contraceptives, the report
   said.
   The study was prepared by Harold N. Burdett, the institute's
director of information, and Werner Fornos, its president.

<HEAD>Tokyo Stocks Rocket Up, Dollar Rises Too</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing stocks, dollar; no pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soared
Monday, while the dollar rose marginally against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 146.42 yen, up 0.09 yen from Friday's
146.33-yen close. It opened at 146.35 yen and ranged between 146.35
yen and 146.55 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average recaptured the 37,000-point
mark, gaining a hefty 420.47 points, or 1.14 percent, to end the
day at 37,257.01.
   The Nikkei, which had nearly reached the 39,000-point level last
year, has fallen below 37,000 points after a series of plunges due
to rumors and declines in Japanese bond prices resulting from the
weak yen.
   Despite Monday's early recovery in the Nikkei, the market
condition has not improved much because of uncertainties over the
coming election, dealers said.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu is expected to dissolve the
512-member House of Representatives Wednesday, with balloting set
for Feb. 18, local media reported.
   ``The recovery is not for real,'' said a trader with Nomura
Securities, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The index seems
to have hit the bottom for now, but the market is still vulnerable
and investors have little incentive to buy. This will continue
until the election.''
   In currency dealings, the dollar opened higher as market players
bought the dollar as a safe investment amid uncertainties over the
ethnic disputes in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, traders said.
   Market players in Tokyo were inclined to buy the dollar and sell
the yen ahead of the election, said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange
analyst with New Japan Securities Co.
   ``The Azerbaijan situation is losing impact on the market here
and won't result in more dollar buying unless something extreme
happens, such as (Mikhail) Gorbachev's resigning,'' he said.
   ``But the yen continues to be weak, as the election
approaches,'' he said.
   Another trader with the Bank of Tokyo said, ``The yen is a
currency that many investors will avoid buying this week,'' ahead
of the scheduled dissolution of Japan's lower house of parliament.
   Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said the
dollar's strength will be met with coordinated intervention by
central banks of the Group of Seven nations including the United
States, Japan, Britain and Switzerland.
   Speaking at a branch managers meeting Monday, Mieno said the
yen's recent weekness is related to international political
uncertainties.

<TEXT>
   Man and the heavens have teamed up against
Valdez, which in March suffered the world's worst oil spill and is
buried under record snows _ 29 feet so far this winter.
   On March 24, the tanker Exxon Valdez piled up on a charted reef
about 30 miles south of the harbor, bleeding about 11 million
gallons of North Slope crude into the gin-clear waters of the
Prince William Sound.
   Exxon's much-criticized cleanup ended in September. Then winter
came.
   By the new year, drifts reached stocking cap level, plows turned
city streets into long, white trenches, and snow crept halfway up
first-floor windows. You couldn't say the town's 3,000 residents
were surprised, however, since Valdez' average annual snowfall is
303 inches, or 25 feet.
   Only then it really started snowing.
   By late Friday, after many days of near-constant snowfall, the
white stuff in the middle of town would have buried a bus. And
still it came down.
   The weight of the snow was threatening to cave in roofs, and the
city marshaled all able-bodied snow shovelers as quickly as they
could be found.
   ``I'm looking out the window,'' said Jack Chappel, manager of a
gas station in the middle of downtown. ``And every building I see
except one has people on the roof removing snow.''
   As of Friday afternoon, Valdez had received 349.3 inches _ 29
feet _ since October, said Tom Ward of the National Weather Service
office. At least two months of winter remain, and the Valdez
snowfall record of 384.7 inches could be buried under just one more
medium-sized drift.
   On Jan. 16 alone, 47{ inches _ 4 feet _ of snow fell, a
single-day record. The 134 inches so far this month shattered the
January snowfall record, Ward said.
   One storm after another has blown in from the south and stalled
over Valdez, trapped by the wall of mountains that rises above the
town, Ward said.
   A weather service measuring stick showed the downtown snow depth
Friday at 7 feet. But it was deeper than that in other parts of
town.
   ``The snow is basically up to the bottom of your second-story
window sills,'' said Police Chief Bert Cottle.
   Four vessels in the harbor, including a 40-foot pleasure boat,
have sunk from the weight of snow on decks, Harbormaster Tim Lopez
said.
   ``It's all we can do to keep the docks from sinking,'' he said.
   Valdez building codes require rooftops to withstand loads of 90
pounds per square foot, twice what's required in Anchorage.
Whenever weights approach the limit, the Valdez public works
department goes on the radio to warn people to get busy.
   They got on the radio last week.
   In a town built on economic booms _ from the Gold Rush to the
pipeline to the oil spill _ the Big Snow has been a boomlet.
   At the start of winter, the going wage for snow shovelers in
Valdez was around $7 an hour, said Doris Giusti, manager of the
state Job Service office.
   ``Now we're up around $16 and even higher than that,'' she said.
``We've had jobs paying $20 an hour to shovel snow. People are
getting desperate to get snow off.''
   Workers have been imported from unemployment offices in
Anchorage, Palmer, Glennallen and Tok, Giusti said.
   So much snow has fallen that shovelers are running out of places
to stack it.
   The city, which was moved and rebuilt after the 1964 Good Friday
Earthquake, was laid out so most of the streets end in cul-de-sacs
along a park strip through the middle of town.
   Loaders and giant blowers pile the snow into mountains at the
end of the streets. By the weekend some snow mountains reached
almost as high as utility poles, residents said.
   Street signs are buried all over town, and cars have collided
because drivers couldn't see around corners, police said.
   No one, however, has been badly hurt.
   ``We did have an individual fall off a roof yesterday,'' said
Cottle, the police chief. ``He wasn't hurt very bad. When the
snow's nine feet deep, there's not very far to fall.''
   Despite the accumulation, Valdez has maintained its record for
never closing school because of snow. ``You're not going to believe
this, but it really hasn't caused us that much of a problem,'' said
Harry Rogers, the school superintendent.

   The chants of Eastern Europe's
pro-democracy protesters as they ousted former Communist overlords
have been sweet music to members of long-deposed royal families.
   The revolutionary changes of the past year have buoyed their
hopes, nurtured during decades in exile, to reclaim their national
stature and perhaps even return to the throne.
   Stifled under decades of Communist rule, their aspirations have
now even gained some support at home. When a crowd spotted Otto von
Hapsburg on a street in Budapest, Hungary, in April, it chanted
``Long Live the King!''
   Romania's King Michael I waits for his people's call, and
Albania's King Leka I would like to come home from South Africa.
   Indeed, von Hapsburg and King Michael appear to have a chance at
public office _ if only honorary _ in their homelands.
   The prospect of restoring royalty, of course, is unthinkable to
many citizens of Eastern Europe. Monarchists seem to be in the
minority.
   Hungary plans to establish a multi-party democracy this year,
and Romania has tentative plans to follow suit.
   In Romania, even the word ``dynasty'' smacks of repression,
reminding most people of the clan of executed dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu. He ruled like an absolute monarch, installing family
members in key positions.
   Bernd Posselt, von Hapsburg's spokesman, seemed to agree with
public speculation that his boss might stand a chance to become
Hungary's state president this year.
   He said ``all options are being kept open, and the matter is
again under review.''
   The aide spoke to The Associated Press in a recent telephone
interview from Strasbourg, France. Hapsburg, the eldest son of King
Karl VI of Hungary _ also Emperor Karl I of Austria _ is now a
Bavarian deputy in the European Parliament.
   After the collapse of the Austrian Empire, the Hapsburg family
had to leave Austria and settled in Switzerland. Two attempts by
Otto's father to restore the kingdom in Hungary in 1919 and 1920
failed.
   During his first official visit to Hungary in February, von
Hapsburg, who is fluent in Hungarian, received a hero's welcome.
   During the April visit, thousands of Hungarians cheered him
again to chants of ``Long Live The King!'' as Otto and members of
his family emerged from a church following a requiem for his mother
Zita, the last queen of Hungary, who died in March at age 96.
   In Romania, the return of 67-year-old King Michael is seen by
some Romanians as a guarantee that the Communist Party will never
again come to power.
   On Dec. 22, the day Ceausescu was overthrown, the exiled king
said he was ready to return to his country as head of a
constitutional monarchy.
   ``I have been waiting for this for 40 years,'' he told a hastily
convened news conference in Geneva, near his home in exile. ``If
people want me to come back, of course, I will come back.''
   Michael was forced to abdicate in December 1947 amid the
prospect of civil war and pressure from the Kremlin and its
Romanian Communist allies.
   Two of King Michael's exiled daughters, Sophie and Margarita,
were privately visiting Romania on Sunday.
   Margarita was asked at a news conference whether she was
surprised by being met at the airport Thursday by a group of
Romanians shouting ``Long Live The King!''
   ``I didn't know what to expect,'' she said. ``We were Romanians
coming home _ that's the one thing that struck me.''
   She stressed, however, that she and her sister ``have not come
here in any bid to restore the monarchy _ I want that to be
absolutely clear.''
   ``My father has waited for 42 years to come back to his country
as a Romanian, but as to when or how _ I don't think I can answer
right now,'' she said.
   King Simeon II of Bulgaria, where the monarchy was abolished in
1946, said Wednesday he believes his return to his homeland would
be premature.
   ``I'm no one to dictate or to impose conditions .... It's not up
to me .... Anyway, it's too early for this question.,'' he said.
   ``And in another way I would at this point be much more useful
abroad with my contacts and connections,'' the 52-year-old ex-king
told the AP from his home in Madrid.
   By contrast, the Albanian would-be king is eagerly waiting for
his hour of triumph at his home in a suburb of Johannesburg.
   King Leka, an exile for all his 50 years, believes political
upheaval in the Soviet bloc will ignite an uprising among the
people of Albania, the last hard-line Communist state in the region.
   Reports in Yugoslav and Greek news media about recent unrest and
casualties in Shkodra and other Albanian cities have been denied by
Albanian officials.
   If a revolution comes, Leka says, he would be proud to follow
the footsteps of his father, King Zog I.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, the
British bible of Europe's bluest blood, said last week that ``this
upheaval in Eastern Europe is the last chance, in my opinion, that
these contenders have to re-establish their thrones.''
   ``The fact that King Michael and Otto von Hapsburg are immensely
popular with political groups pushing for their restoration has
moved this from fairy-tale stage to world stage,'' he told the AP
in London.
   Grand Duke Vladimir, 72-year-old head of the Imperial House of
Romanov and heir to the Russian throne, has even urged restoration
of the Russian monarchy.
   On Friday, at a ball the Russian royal family held in London to
raise funds for the Russian Orthodox Church there, Vladimir told a
reporter: ``Russian people would think quite seriously about a
monarchial form of government. A monarchy would be something for
them to rally round.''
   During the ball, the Imperial Russian anthem ``God Preserve the
Czar'' was played _ over and over.

<HEAD>Industry Mourns Death of Stanwyck at 82</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Stanwyck, the leading lady of film
classics whose 60-year show business career began on the chorus
line, ended in television and included a rich variety of roles, has
died at age 82.
   ``She was marvelous and unfailingly professional, very demanding
that everything be done as well as it could be,'' said Charlton
Heston, who starred with Stanwyck in the television series, ``The
Colbys.''
   Miss Stanwyck died Saturday evening at age 82 of congestive
heart failure at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa
Monica, said agent Larry Kleno.
   Stanwyck's career spanned the chorus line, vaudeville, motion
pictures and television, earning her three Emmys and four Academy
Award nominations.
   Her versatility _ running the gamut from mercenary murderess in
``Double Indemnity'' to horrified and helpless victim in ``Sorry
Wrong Number'' _ gained Miss Stanwyck respect as a matriarch of the
entertainment industry.
   Stanwyck's only Oscar was an honorary statuette presented in
1982 for the body of her work. And the American Film Institute gave
her its most prestigious honor, the Life Achievement Award, in 1987.
   ``She was just the most wonderful (actress) in the whole
business, and I worked with a lot of them,'' said Fred MacMurray,
who plotted murder with Stanwyck in ``Double Indemnity.''
   ``Everyone in this industry looked up to her as such a
perfectionist,'' said actress Jane Wyman, a longtime friend. ``Her
honesty in everything she did came through on the screen, but she
never took credit for it. Her ego was never first. It was always
her work.''
   Actress Dorothy Lamour said, ``She was a wonderful human being
and the industry lost something very great when it lost her.''
   The youngest of five children, Miss Stanwyck was born Ruby
Stevens on July 16, 1907, in Brooklyn, and was orphaned at age 4.
She was raised by an older sister, Millie, a chorus girl who
boarded her with other families when she was on the road.
   By the time she was 15 she was a floor show dancer in New York
cabarets and with the Ziegfeld Follies. Playwright Willard Mack
rechristened her Barbara Stanwyck after glancing at a playbill that
read ``Jane Stanwyck in Barbara Fritchie.''
   She married vaudeville comedian Frank Fay in 1928 and they
adopted a son, Anthony Dion Fay. They divorced in 1935. She married
Robert Taylor in 1939 and divorced him in 1951.
   Miss Stanwyck appeared in more than 80 movies starting in 1927.
She was nominated for Oscars for ``Stella Dallas'' in 1937; ``Ball
of Fire'' in 1942 with Gary Cooper; ``Double Indemnity'' with
MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson in 1944, and ``Sorry Wrong
Number'' with Burt Lancaster in 1948.
   Her co-stars were top leading men: Henry Fonda in ``The Lady
Eve,'' James Cagney in ``These Wilder Years,'' Clark Gable in ``To
Please a Lady,'' Errol Flynn in ``Cry Wolf,'' and Humphrey Bogart
in ``The Two Mrs. Carrolls.''
   She kissed Ronald Reagan passionately in ``Cattle Queen of
Montana'' and was teamed with Elvis Presley in ``Roustabout.''
   ``The Barbara Stanwyck Show'' ran on television from September
1960 to September 1961. She hosted the program of half-hour plays
and appeared in most episodes.
   ``The Big Valley,'' a Western, ran from September 1965 to May
1969. Miss Stanwyck played Victoria Barkley, matriarch of the
Barkley ranch and strong-willed mother of Jarrod, Nick, Heath and
Audra.
   She also appeared on ``General Electric Theater'' during its
eight-year run and was in ``The Colbys'' for one season in 1986.
   Miss Stanwyck garnered Emmys for ``The Barbara Stanwyck Show''
in 1961, ``The Big Valley'' in 1966 and the miniseries ``Thorn
Birds'' in 1983.

   Gordon Dorian looks and sounds like a
typical smooth-talking car dealer as he strolls around the showroom
of Mel Hambelton Ford, shaking hands with customers.
   But his name tag reveals he's a salesman of a different kind. It
reads: ``Dr. Gordon Dorian, chaplain.''
   Dorian is a retired Southern Baptist preacher who spends two or
three days a week counseling some of the dealership's 115 employees.
   Dorian, 67, joined the dealership last May at the invitation of
owner Mel Hambelton, who seven years earlier had been converted to
the faith by Dorian, then pastor of Olivet Baptist Church in west
Wichita.
   ``What's good for me might be good for other people,'' Hambelton
said.
   Some employees weren't excited about the idea, but Dorian said
he doesn't preach at employees and only offers advice when asked.
   Employees occasionally stop by his cubbyhole-size office to talk
about personal matters. At other times, Dorian speaks with workers
on the job, sometimes offering a spiritual pick-me-up.
   ``It may be just a quick prayer,'' he said, snapping his
fingers. ``Just so it won't be obnoxiously noticeable.''
   For his work, he receives a ``small token'' salary and the
choice of any car on the lot to drive.
   Dorian's job is not limited to counseling employees. Sometimes
he tries to soothe ruffled customers waiting for car repairs.
   ``I talk to people and sympathize with them,'' he said. ``But I
tell them I know the guys, and they're doing the very best they
can.''
   Do customers ever ask him to lay hands on their cars for some
less expensive healing?
   ``Yeah, they have,'' he said, laughing. ``We've had fun with
it.''

   Frances Leary says a policy of no heavy lifting
helped her reach age 104.
   ``My mother always told me to be a good girl, and if she was
here today she'd say `I guess you've been a good girl `cause you
made it to 104,''' said Leary, who marked her birthday Friday.
   Leary, a lifelong Boston resident, worked in a shoe factory for
22 years before getting married at age 39.
   A music lover, she fondly recalled taking part in Irish dances
in Boston ballrooms and remembered when phonographs replaced live
music.
   ``I would listen to that thing for hours,'' she said. ``That's
when I gave my piano away.''
   Leary said she has never been sick a day in her life. When asked
for advice on how to reach her age, she said: ``I just try to go
along and not lift anything heavy.''

<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index surged back
above 37,000 points today, and the dollar edged up against the
Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 420.47 points, or 1.14
percent, closing at 37,257.01.
   The Nikkei, which nearly had reached 39,000 points at the end of
last year, turned around in early January and fell below 37,000 in
a series of plunges triggered by rumors and declines in Japanese
government bond prices resulting from the weak yen.
   Today, ``market players were no longer pessimistic about the
Japanese government bond prices, and the index finally began
rising, after so many losses,'' said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a dealer with
Daiwa Securities Co.
   Suzuki said today's increase came in the absence of active
selling.
   ``Some market players were still reluctant to buy actively, and
the market has just begun to make up for the losses. Its energy
hasn't returned to the normal level,'' he added.
   Trading was extremely thin, with only 350 million shares
changing hands on the first section. The volume today was the
lowest in five months, Suzuki said.
   ``The recovery is not for real,'' said a trader with Nomura
Securities, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``The index seems to have hit bottom for now, but the market is
still vulnerable and investors have little incentive to buy,'' he
said. ``This will continue until the election.''
   The markets are waiting to see the fate of the pro-business
Liberal Democratic Party in elections for Parliament's lower house,
expected Feb. 18. Last July, it lost its majority in the upper
house for the first time in 34 years.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 146.42 yen, up 0.09
yen from Friday's 146.33-yen close. It opened at 146.35 yen and
ranged between 146.35 yen and 146.55 yen.
   The dollar rose quickly in early trading as market players
adjusted their oversold dollar positions, traders said.
   But the market then became concerned about possible central bank
intervention to support the yen, and some players sold dollars to
take profits, said Yuji Nakao, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   He said the dollar attracted investors more than any other
currency amid ethnic troubles in the Soviet Union and political
uncertainties here.
   ``The dollar was also stronger against the (West German) mark,''
he said. ``Market players sold the mark for profit-taking, as well
as for fear of uncertainties in Eastern Europe.''
   The German mark had been bought heavily as democratization
movements progressed in the East bloc, but market players ``believe
the key to such movements is the stability of (Mikhail) Gorbachev's
leadership'' in the Soviet Union, Nakao said.
   About $5.72 billion changed hands in spot trading today.

   David Rothenberg is terrified, his mother is
frantic and prison officials are uneasy. David's father, who set
fire to his son in a bungled 1983 murder-suicide plan, walks out of
prison this week.
   Six-year-old David survived the flames but was horribly
disfigured. The jarring crime was portrayed in ``David,'' a 1988
ABC-TV movie starring Bernadette Peters and John Glover.
   If convicted under current laws, Charles Rothenberg would be
imprisoned for life. But sentencing laws in place at the time force
the state to release Rothenberg after less than seven years behind
bars.
   ``We are not comfortable with it,'' said Tipton Kindel,
spokesman for the state Department of Corrections. ``The crime was
absolutely disgusting to the rest of society, and we are not
entirely comfortable with him walking free.
   ``It makes it seem like the Department of Corrections is letting
him go, but that isn't so. We have to let him go.''
   Rothenberg, 49, leaves the state prison in San Luis Obispo on
Wednesday, but prison officials are keeping relocation plans
secret, conceding they fear a repeat of the 1987 Larry Singleton
hysteria.
   Singleton, who raped a teen-age girl and left her for dead after
hacking off her forearms with an ax, was driven from Northern
California communities by an outraged public and eventually served
his year on parole in a trailer at San Quentin Prison.
   After a telephone argument with his ex-wife, Rothenberg set fire
to his son in a Buena Park motel room on March 3, 1983. ``If I
can't have him, nobody else can,'' Rothenberg said, telling
authorities he was going to kill himself but was too much of a
coward.
   ``Do I deserve to be set free? No! It's an unforgivable act,''
Rothenberg said in a December letter to the Los Angeles Times.
Rothenberg said he didn't know where he was going to live during
his three-years' parole.
   David, his mother, Marie, and stepfather, Richard Hafdahl, also
are not being told where Rothenberg is resettling, except that he
won't be within 25 miles of them, Kindel said.
   Hafdahl, a police officer who met David and his mother while
supervising the fire investigation, said Marie and her son were
upset.
   ``She doesn't trust him and David is terrified. We've talked
about it and we have security measures I won't go into,'' Hafdahl
said.
   Rothenberg had taken David, who lived in New York at the time,
on vacation to Southern California, and checked them into a motel
near Knott's Berry Farm.
   He gave the boy a sleeping pill, poured kerosene on the his bed,
kissed him goodbye and struck a match in the doorway. He watched
from a telephone booth across the street as flames consumed the
motel room.
   David, dragged from the inferno by motel guests, suffered
third-degree burns over 90 percent of his body.
   The boy, now 13, will have to endure periodic skin grafts until
he is fully grown, Hafdahl said.
   Rothenberg was convicted of attempted murder, arson and other
charges and got a maximum 13-year prison term that was halved
because of good behavior. He will be closely watched while on
parole.
   ``Although he's not confined to a prison, he will be under
intense scrutiny to make sure he is complying with the conditions
of parole,'' said Kindel.
   Rothenberg must stay away from his son, ex-wife and Hafdahl. He
cannot leave his parole jurisdiction, must report regularly to his
parole officer and he must submit to weekly psychiatric counseling
sessions.
   ``I don't want to ever see you again because, you know, I'm
afraid that you'll try to hurt me again,'' David told his father in
a 1988 TV interview.

<HEAD>Valdez Captain Says He Got Bum Rap</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood has gotten
used to the notoriety that came with command of the vessel involved
in the nation's worst oil spill, but he's surprised at the tenacity
of his critics.
   ``I'm handling infamy reasonably well,'' he told Life magazine
for its February issue. ``But it's amazing how it won't go away.''
   Hazelwood, who goes on trial Jan. 29 in Anchorage, Alaska, on
charges stemming from the disaster, said he had received death
threats at his home and was tired of being portrayed as ``a drunken
bum with a parrot on my shoulder who drove his ship aground.''
   The oil tanker captain, who has a history of alcoholism, has
been accused of drinking the night of the accident, which spilled
about 11 million gallons of oil into the Prince William Sound. He
denies the claim and said Exxon Corp. has made him a scapegoat.
   Prosecutors said he should have been at the helm since he was
the ship's only authorized navigator for the sound. His lawyers say
the Coast Guard relaxed the rules in 1986.
   Hazelwood has pleaded innocent. He faces more than seven years
in prison and $65,000 in fines if convicted. Asked if he expected
justice, he replied, ``You mean like a Frank Capra movie?''
   The 43-year-old skipper said Exxon has made him a scapegoat. He
said he was ``flushed down the toilet in two-a-day press
conferences'' by officials trying to give the impression ``that
containment and cleanup were my responsibility as well.
   ``For three days, until Easter Sunday night when the wind came
up, that big puddle of oil didn't impact the shore. I was shocked
by the lack of response initially. Angry and amazed.''
   Since getting fired by Exxon, he has made his living lobstering
near his suburban Long Island home.

   A freighter loaded with petroleum coke
collided with a tugboat off Delaware and ruptured a fuel tank, but
there was no indication of a major spill, the Coast Guard said.
   Two people aboard the 113-foot tug Socrates were injured when
the vessels collided in the Atlantic 25 miles east of Cape Henlopen
Friday evening. One suffered rib injuries and the other had a
three-inch cut across the face, the Coast Guard said.
   The 593-foot freighter Doo Yang Leader was stopped at sea to
check for leaks, said Coast Guard spokesman Breck Smith. The ship
was carrying petroleum coke, a residue from a process that breaks
down petroleum products.
   There was no indication of coke spillage, but Coast Guard Petty
Officer Richard Minnich said the South Korea-registered freighter
apparently had a ruptured fuel tank.
   ``We dont know how much oil is in the water right now or even if
there is any,'' said Coast Guard Petty Officer John Brazelle in
Cape May, N.J.
   The tug _ owned by Allied Towing Corp. of Norfolk, Va. _
sustained damage to its cabin, but was able to continue on toward
New York, towing a 300-foot barge carrying sugar.

<TEXT>
   People with AIDS should reach normal life
expectancy during the 1990s as treatments become available to make
AIDS a manageable disease, a leading government researcher says.
   ``I have a good deal of confidence ... that we can look forward
to the 1990s as the kind of a decade where that goal can be
realized,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the national
program to test and evaluate new anti-AIDS drugs. He spoke at the
New York-Italy Medical Symposium in New York.
   Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., one of the National
Institutes of Health. The institute operates a national AIDS
drug-testing program in which some 10,000 people are subjects in
experimental tests at 46 medical centers across the country.
   Learning to manage and control AIDS is not the same as curing
it, Fauci said. The treatments of the 1990s probably will have to
be contined for life in people infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS, he said.
   Fauci said he based his optimistic prediction for the 1990s on
the growing understanding of the workings of the AIDS virus, the
success in AIDS treatment achieved so far, and a philosophical
shift in the way government makes new drugs available.
   Until now, AIDS drugs have been developed largely by screening
available substances for possible anti-viral activity, he said. The
increasing understanding of how the virus infects cells, kills them
and reproduces is leading to new drugs aimed directly at each of
those steps in the virus' growth, Fauci said.
   ``Already there are several drugs ready to go into (human)
clinical trials that have been specifically tailored to HIV,''
Fauci said.
   Fauci said researchers scored several successes against AIDS
during the 1980s.
   First, they improved care of the sick. In 1985, less than 40
percent of people diagnosed with AIDS survived 18 months. By 1987,
60 percent lived at least that long after diagnosis, Fauci said.
   Second, researchers discovered that treatment could be helpful
in people who are infected with HIV but have not yet become sick.
For example, drugs to protect against pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia, an often fatal AIDS complication, can now sharply reduce
its frequency.
   AZT, the current mainstay of treatment in people sick with AIDS,
has been shown to significantly delay the progression or onset of
symptoms in people infected with HIV but not yet sick, Fauci said.
   There are now ``hundreds of thousands who can benefit from early
intervention,'' he said.
   Third, the government has decided to relax its grip on
experimental drugs in cases where the drugs offer hope to people
whose lives are threatened and who have few other options, Fauci
said.
   He was referring to the so-called ``parallel track'' program, in
which promising experimental drugs are made available to patients
who need them before experiments have conclusively determined their
effectiveness.
   ``This is a philosophical change that needs to be integrated
into our way of thinking,'' he said.
   It means that the government will not be able to guarantee the
effectiveness _ or the safety _ of those drugs, Fauci said.
   The responsibility for accepting the increased risks associated
with such drugs ``is going to shift to the individuals taking the
drugs,'' he said.

<HEAD>Snow in Northeast; Rain, Freezing Rain in Northwest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Light snow fell today in parts of the Northeast from the
remnants of a storm that hurled occasional lightning as it dumped
as much as 10 inches of snow. Some airports were forced to close.
   Parts of the Upper Great Lakes region also had snow this
morning, while rain and freezing rain fell in the Pacific
Northwest. Dry weather prevailed throughout the rest of the nation.
   The clash of a warm front moving in from the Atlantic with a
cold front coming from the west Sunday created the right conditions
for a Northeast snowstorm that sometimes sounded like a summer
cloudburst, said forecaster Charlie Foley of the National Weather
Service in Boston.
   ``The two fronts are fighting each other, and that's the
result,'' Foley said. ``It's an unusual occurrence, but not rare.''
   Light snow continued falling this morning from northern New York
to Maine, while rain was changing to snow on Cape Cod in
Massachusetts.
   Snowfall totals by Sunday night included up to 10 inches in
central, southern and coastal areas of New Hampshire; 9 inches in
coastal communities north of Boston; and up to 8 inches in suburbs
of Albany, N.Y.
   The snow forced Logan International Airport in Boston to close
for nearly two hours. The commercial airport in Manchester, N.H.,
also was closed temporarily.
   Police throughout the region reported many minor accidents
because of slippery roads.
   Operators of ski areas rejoiced.
   ``I just wish it had happened Friday,'' said Sabrina Patenaude
of Pat's Peak in Henniker, N.H.
   In the Northwest, a small but energetic Pacific disturbance
brought freezing rain to Spokane, Wash., and rain to Seattle this
morning.
   The same system was expected to bring high winds to parts of the
north central United States later today. A high-wind watch was
issued for the mountains of northwestern Wyoming.
   Strong Santa Ana winds, meanwhile, developed in Southern
California on Sunday.
   Clouds and light snow were over parts of the Upper Great Lakes
region, with snow falling this morning in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with clear
skies over much of the south central and southwestern United States.
   Temperatures remained below freezing Sunday across parts of the
Upper Mississippi Valley, the Upper Great Lakes region, and the
northern Atlantic Coast region, with highs only in the teens and
single numbers in Northern New England.
   The low for the nation Sunday was 6 degrees below zero at West
Yellowstone, Mont.
   Temperatures warmed into the 50s and 60s in California and
southern Arizona and across much of the south central and
southeastern United States on Sunday, with readings in the 70s and
80s in Florida. Seven Florida cities broke records for high
temperatures for the date.
   The high Sunday in the Lower 48 states was 88 degrees at Naples,
Fla.

<HEAD>In A Pinch, Employees Of Connecticut City Get To Bring Kids To
Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New administrations usually shake up
city hall when they take office, but some municipal employees are
worried it's the kids who will turn things topsy-turvy.
   A few weeks after Mayor Paul Gionfriddo was elected in November,
the liberal Democrat announced that municipal employees would be
allowed to bring their children to work in an emergency.
   With three children under age 5, Gionfriddo knew he would have
to let his kids join him at the office occasionally, so it was only
fair that other city workers have that right.
   The policy has provoked considerable debate, and employees who
say they might take advantage of the new rule are hard to find.
   ``To be honest, I don't think I'd bring them in here. I don't
think I could get any work done,'' said Teresa Milardo, a Tax
Department clerk who keeps pictures of her two daughters, ages 2
and 6, in a plastic frame on her desk.
   ``With the 2-year-old, where would I change her diaper?''
Milardo asked. ``Besides, she'd constantly want to go to the water
fountain. It would be a distraction for everyone.''
   Gionfriddo's son Timothy, 4, and 3-year-old daughter, Larissa,
already have visited at least twice. They spent most of the time
coloring or pecking away on typewriters. Once it was because the
mayor's wife had to take their youngest child, a 6-month-old, to
the doctor on a day when the two others were not in day care.
   ``Even the best day-care arrangements fall short of the need.
When there are sicknesses or holidays, you have to have some kind
of backstop,'' said the 36-year-old mayor, whose wife is a
consultant and scholar on child development. A police sergeant
working as a desk supervisor became the first municipal employee in
this central Connecticut city of 43,000 to take advantage of the
policy.
   George R. Dingwall's pregnant wife brought their 3-year-old
daughter, Alyssa, to the station for a couple of hours Jan. 10 when
she had to make a visit to the doctor's office on short notice.
   Alyssa showed up with a Barbie doll and other toys, and spent
her time quietly watching ``Sesame Street,'' munching cookies and
getting a tour from civilians in parking and records, Dingwall said.
   Reaction was generally favorable, he said, and ``I wouldn't
hestitate to do it again if the same circumstances presented
themselves.''
   The mayor's order stipulates that a child must stay inside with
his or her parent or grandparent, as the case may be, and not
interfere with anyone's work. When possible, the employee is
supposed to get permission of a supervisor beforehand.
   Political rivals pounced on the edict as an early sign voters
erred in choosing Gionfriddo, an 11-year veteran of the
legislature, over the incumbent mayor, Republican Sebastian J.
Garafalo.
   The policy was lambasted in The Hartford Courant, which accused
the mayor in an editorial of trying to turn city hall into a
playpen. But The Middletown Press called the plan a gutsy move that
was worth a try.
   A psychologist at Yale University, who is a colleague of
Gionfriddo's wife, also came to the mayor's defense.
   ``I think it is a kind of experimental effort that ought to be
applauded rather than decried,'' said Edward F. Zigler, one of the
architects of the federal Head Start program.
   Gionfriddo's wife, Linda Rammler, is working on her doctorate in
developmental psychology and is a fellow at the Yale child
development center that Zigler directs.
   The mayor acknowledged that some workers suggest he instituted
the policy only to justify the presence of his own children. And he
said he recognizes that many workers have jobs that simply won't
allow them to bring their children to work.
   ``It's clear that a policeman on patrol or a someone riding a
snowplow won't benefit from this,'' he said. ``But you don't deny
everyone the opportunity because they can't.''
   ``It's far better to have the secretary at work with the kids
than sitting at home.''

<HEAD>Race-Baiting Alleged In New Orleans Race</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a campaign marked by charges of
race-baiting, Sidney Barthelemy, a black mayor seeking re-election
in a mostly black city, faces a strong challenge from a white who
never ran for office before.
   Donald Mintz, a lawyer who last year resigned as chairman of the
local dock board so he could run for Barthelemy's job, is expected
to carry a majority among whites, who make up 44.4 percent of the
237,342 voters registered for the Feb. 3 election.
   Once an ally of the late Dutch Morial, the city's first black
mayor, Mintz has worked aggressively to lure black voters away from
Barthelemy.
   Mintz's campaign first accused Barthelemy of trying to separate
the city along racial lines in November, when a coalition of black
ministers endorsed Barthelemy.
   ``The minister that I follow is the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King,
and he judged a person on the content of their character and not
the color of their skin,'' said Mintz' campaign manager, Michael
Bagneris, who is black. ``If race-baiting is wrong when white folks
do it, it's wrong when black folks do it.''
   The issue resurfaced this month, when Barthelemy's campaign ran
a series of radio advertisements praising his record of promoting
and appointing blacks. ``Let us not be fooled by the claims of a
white politician,'' two of the ads say.
   Mintz replied: ``It's fraud to stand up here and say, `I'm
against racism and anti-Semitism,' and then resort to tactics that
racially divide the community.''
   But Barthelemy's campaign manager, Reynard Rochon, said, ``The
only person who keeps bringing up race in this election is Donald
Mintz ... He's trying to use a psychological thing on the black
community, making them feel like they're racist if they support
Sidney.''
   Barthelemy said in an interview that the ads just tell the black
community what he has done for blacks. He accused Mintz of starting
the race-baiting by distributing an anonymous flier showing
Barthelemy with a half-white face.
   ``I know people in his campaign who said they put them out,''
Barthelemy said, though he would not name his sources.
   Mintz, who was unavailable for an interview, has denied anyone
in his campaign published the flier, which he described as trash.
   While race has played a part in the campaign, high crime, low
employment, and the political experience and competence of the
candidates have been the major issues.
   In television ads, the Mintz campaign touts its man as a
``tough, capable leader,'' and cites a Fortune magazine article
describing New Orleans as one of the nation's five worst-managed
cities.
   Mintz blames Barthelemy for the city's loss of 20,000 jobs in
four years and complains that low police morale has contributed to
a rising crime rate. The city had 249 murders in 1989, a record for
a single year.
   Barthelemy, who took office in 1986 facing a $30 million deficit
left by the Morial administration, counters that he has brought New
Orleans back from its worst depression ever, brought on by the
collapse of the oil industry.
   He says projects begun under his mandate will bring in 12,000
jobs during the next few years.
   Barthelemy has hit hard at Mintz' lack of public experience, and
said the New Orleans port lost hundreds of millions of dollars a
year under Mintz.
   Early polls showed Mintz leading Barthelemy and also gave
Morial, mayor from 1978 until 1986, a good chance of retaking the
office he was not legally allowed to hold for three consecutive
terms.
   Morial decided against running, however, and died of a heart
attack the day before Christmas without making an endorsement.
   A poll taken for WWL-TV on Jan. 5 showed Barthelemy leading
Mintz 44 percent to 33 percent, with the remaining 23 percent of
the voters undecided.

<TEXT>
   An expert says the Christmas freeze may
be responsible for killing at least 24 bottlenose dolphins that
were found floating or washed ashore in Matagorda Bay over the
weekend.
   The kill is the worst on the Texas coast in a decade, officials
said.
   Volunteers on Sunday helped pull the carcasses from Matagorda
Bay, about halfway between Galveston and Corpus Christi on the Gulf
Coast.
   Experts from the Texas Marine Mammal Stranding Network planned
to examine the carcasses today to determine what killed the
animals, said Mike Carvan at the organization's office in
Galveston. But tests could take months and the exact cause of death
may never be known, officials said.
   The three-day freeze, which ruined much of the south Texas
citrus crop and dumped snow on Houston, killed thousands of fish
along the Texas coast. It may have doomed the dolphins as well,
said Game Warden Arthur Lawrence.
   ``Several acres of this bay was covered with ice, a slushy-type
of ice material _ and apparently it made it hard for these dolphins
to breathe,'' said Lawrence. ``Some of them probably became
disoriented and stunned as a result of this cold and icy weather
and they can suffocate and suffer pneumonia just like a human.''
   Game wardens worked during the freeze to break up ice in the
marshy areas around the bay.
   A helicopter pilot spotted floating dolphin carcasses in
Matagorda Bay late Saturday, Lawrence said. After an early morning
search of the area Sunday, wildlife officials were unable to find
any of the dolphins alive.
   ``I came out to check if the animals were in stress and found
they were already partially decomposed,'' Lawrence said.
   ``It ain't fair. It ain't right,'' said H.F. Fuselier, a
Matagorda fisherman, as he watched Coast Guard members hoist a
7-foot male dolphin's carcass into the bed of a pickup.
   Rose Folmar, a bartender at Allen's Landing in Matagorda who was
helping monitor the recovery effort, said some volunteers doubted
the freeze theory because it's been so long since the cold snap.
   ``That's what's puzzling,'' Ms. Folmar said. ``If the freeze was
about a month ago, why are the dead dolphins showing up now? We
won't really know until the biologists tell us after the
autopsies.''
   Others suggested that toxic pollutants from coastal industries
might have contributed to the kill.
   Searchers also found thousands of dead mullet _ tough fish that
normally remain in the bay during cold weather while prized redfish
and speckled trout instinctively head for deep water.

   The Bush family is split along gender lines on
the issue of abortion, Newsweek magazine reports, with George and
Barbara heading the opposing camps.
   President Bush and his wife discussed abortion at a recent
get-together with their children and spouses and found all the men
were anti-abortion and all the women were pro-choice, said the
magazine, released Sunday. It did not name its source.
   Bush opposes abortion except to save the mother's life or in
cases of rape or incest. He opposes federal funding of abortions
except to save the mother's life.
   The president planned to address today's annual ``March for
Life'' rally on the Ellipse by telephone from the Oval Office. He
made a similar call in support of anti-abortionists last year, as
former President Reagan did before him.
   Today is the 17th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe vs.
Wade decision, which made abortion legal.
   Some of the women at the Bush family gathering, including the
first lady, said abortion should not be without controls, but
insisted on a woman's right to choose in certain circumstances,
Newsweek said.
   White House spokesman Sean Walsh declined Sunday night to
comment on the article.
   Mrs. Bush has refused to answer reporters' questions about her
personal views on abortion.
   Some Republican strategists blame the party's hard-line stance
against abortion rights for recent gubernatorial defeats in
Virginia and New Jersey.
   Bush has said his opposition to abortion is unwavering, but that
the Republican Party is large enough to embrace people with
differing views on the issue.

<HEAD>Students Battle Police in Protest Over Labor Arrests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radical students hurling firebombs and
rocks today battled police after rallying with workers who are
trying to inaugurate a nationwide union that the government has
outlawed.
   The clashes erupted on five campuses in Seoul and three other
cities where students called for a joint effort with militant
workers to overthrow the government of President Roh Tae-woo.
   Hundreds of students and workers were arrested, but no police
figures were available.
   In Suwon, about 25 miles south of Seoul, about 600 riot police
rushed into a building of Sungkyunkwan University firing tear gas
to break up an indoor rally by about 400 activists.
   Dozens of radical students brandished clubs and hurled rocks and
chairs as police smashed windows and moved in. Yonhap, the South
Korean news agency, reported about 100 workers and students
arrested.
   The rally in Suwon was to have been held at Seoul National
University by about 1,200 delegates claiming to represent 200,000
militant workers. But workers had to shift the site after about
2,500 riot police sealed the Seoul National campus.
   Police said about 15,000 riot police were mobilized in Seoul to
thwart the rally there and arrest workers. Police were seen
checking pedestrians around major campuses and bus terminals.
   Hard-line workers supported by dissidents and radical students
have tried to form a new nationwide union to strengthen their
influence. The government outlawed the union, accusing leftists of
trying to use workers to strengthen their anti-government movement.
   In Seoul, groups of 50 to 300 students armed with firebombs
mounted street protests in several places and clashed with police.
Fighting also was reported from two campuses in Seoul and two
others in the cities of Taegu and Chonju involving a total of about
1,500 students.
   Police arrested four dissidents who brandished firebombs, took a
secretary hostage and occupied a Labor Ministry office in Taejon,
Yonhap said.
   Shouting ``Overthrow the suppressive regime!'' the protesters
jumped from the second-floor office to mattresses on the ground
when police knocked down locked doors and charged in, it said.
   During the protests, students vowed to join a nationwide
anti-government drive with workers to end what they called a
prolonged pro-American military dictatorship in South Korea.
   In a special Cabinet meeting Saturday, Roh ordered firm action
against any illegal and violent union activities. He warned that
violent labor strikes would hurt the nation's already sluggish
economy.
   Government officials contend some union activists advocate class
struggle under an anti-U.S. and anti-government line espoused by
radicals. Police have brought charges against 170 of about 6,000
workers rounded up last year for taking part in illegal, violent
strikes.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher, Gold Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was higher against other major
currencies in Europe late this morning, boosted by the absence of
central bank intervention.
   Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange traders said the dollar was trading calmly
after earlier forays higher in Tokyo trading failed to bring out
the central banks.
   The dollar's rally is being fueled by continuing tensions in the
Soviet Union and by increasing predictions that U.S. interest rates
won't decline in the short-term as previously expected, dealers
said.
   ``The certainty that U.S. rates are heading lower in the near
term has disappeared,'' one Milan trader said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.09 yen to a closing 146.42 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 146.30 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.7185 West German marks, up from 1.7050
   _1.5265 Swiss francs, up from 1.5140
   _5.8418 French francs, up from 5.6955
   _1.9366 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9310
   _1,278.50 Italian lire, up from 1,269.25
   _1.1815 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1786
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.6443 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6475 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $409.00 a troy ounce,
down from $410.25 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $408.70.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $408.65, unchanged from Friday's
late bid.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell $1.50 to close at a bid $407.85.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.21 a troy ounce from
Friday's $5.22.

<HEAD>Pro-Democracy Group Protests Despite Ban</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Mongolians demanding democratic
reform from Communist rulers defied a government ban and rallied in
their capital for a second straight week, a Western source said
today.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police made
no attempt to break up the rally on the central square of Ulan
Bator, despite the ban on such unauthorized assemblies imposed
Thursday.
   Sunday's rally by about 5,000 people, organized by the Mongolian
Democratic Union, lasted nearly two hours in temperatures of about
minus nine.
   The union, which claims 70,000 supporters, has presented the
first open, organized opposition to a government ruled by the
Communist Party since 1921, longer than any other country outside
Mongolia's patron state, the Soviet Union.
   The reform group organized two small demonstrations in December
and another on Jan. 14 that drew about 5,000. It had official
permission for all three of those gatherings.
   So far, both sides appear to be trying to avoid a confrontation,
although the government's ban and the group's latest protest
suggests they are hardening their positions.
   At Sunday's demonstration, people carried banners reading ``If
people are rich, the Mongolian nation will be rich,'' and calling
for an end to special privileges for officials.
   One banner written in English read ``We support perestroika and
glasnost,'' a reference to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
programs of reform and openness.
   Another group calling itself the Democratic Socialist Movement
and saying it was more radical than the Democratic Union passed out
fliers calling for a free press, a multiparty system, adherence to
the U.N. Declaration on Human Rights, more independence in the
economic sphere and greater protection of the national culture.
   Mongolia's economy and culture have long been dominated by the
Soviet Union. The Russian Cyrillic alphabet was officially adopted
in 1946. The traditional Mongolian script was banned until about
five years ago.
   Many of Mongolia's 2 million people, dispersed across grasslands
roughly the size of Western Europe, still have deep links to their
herdsman traditions, and the nation's small amount of industry
sprang largely from Soviet or East European aid.
   The leader of the Democratic Union, 27-year-old Sanjaasuren
Zorig, speaking at a news conference after the rally, did not rule
out confrontation with the government. However, he said his group
puts ``great hopes on the sober minds'' of government leaders,
according to the Western source.
   Zorig said his group regards itself as a guarantor for
developing and deepening democracy in Mongolia and said it stands
for a multiparty system.
   He blamed Mongolia's low level of economic development on
central controls over the economy and state ownership of property.

   Drug and alcohol tests were administered
to 18 staff and school board members at Homewood-Flossmoor High
School, and now it is the student athletes' turn.
   A lottery will select 15 athletes a week, starting this week, to
be tested for alcohol and 10 drugs. Two of the samples will be
checked for steroids. During the semester a total of 277 athletes
will undergo screening in the school district south of Chicago.
   Football coach John Wrenn said the program already is working.
   ``Through the grapevine I've heard that some students have
gotten help,'' Wrenn said. ``That's what this program is for, not
to punish kids, but to get them help.''
   Athletic director Ken Schultz submitted the first urine specimen
Friday followed by the principal, Charles Smith, and 16 other
administrators and school board members.
   The testing will cost $40,000 to $50,000, school officials said.
It will be paid for through donations and increased ticket prices
for football and basketball games.
   Athletes who fail the test will be evaluated by a drug conselor
and will be suspended from school for 30 days if considered
chemically dependent. They will be reinstated if they follow a
treatment plan and pass a new test, but could be suspended for up
to a year if they fail the follow-up test.

   The space shuttle Columbia
and the 11-ton satellite it plucked from space are being prepared
for travel to Kennedy Space Center in Florida, a NASA spokeswoman
said.
   Ground crews were making special efforts to protect the
shuttle's cargo for the voyage atop a jetliner, scheduled to begin
Thursday.
   ``The work is proceeding very well. The orbiter appears to be
very healthy, as does LDEF,'' spokeswoman Patricia Phillips said
Thursday. She was referring to the Long Duration Exposure Facility,
the rescued laboratory satellite.
   Columbia and five astronauts landed at this Mojave Desert
military base early Saturday, ending a record-length shuttle flight
of nearly 11 days.
   During the mission, the astronauts deployed a Navy
communications satellite, then used the shuttle's robot arm to
retrieve the LDEF, which soon would have fallen into Earth's
atmosphere and burned if it had not been rescued.
   About a third of the LDEF's 57 experiments will help researchers
learn what materials can withstand long periods in space and thus
might be suitable for building U.S. space station Freedom, which
NASA hopes to operate in the mid-1990s.
   The satellite will not be removed from Columbia's cargo bay
until after the shuttle returns to Florida on Friday night, riding
piggyback atop a modified Boeing 747.
   Phillips said NASA hopes the piggyback jet ride will start early
Thursday, with a refueling stop at Davis-Montham Air Force Base
near Tucson, Ariz., before stopping for the night at Kelly Air
Force Base near San Antonio. On Friday, the shuttle will refuel at
Eglin Air Force Base in Florida's panhandle before finally arriving
at Kennedy Space Center, she said.
   To protect LDEF from contamination, ground crews started pumping
cool, conditioned air and nitrogen into the cargo bay even before
Columbia was towed off the concrete runway Saturday morning,
Phillips said.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration and contractor
employees worked on Columbia on Sunday while it sat inside the
large steel girder structure called the mate-demate device, where
it will be mounted atop the jet later in the week.
   ``Overall, the vehicle is in excellent condition. Any damage is
minimal,'' Phillips said.
   She said the number of ``dings'' found on the orbiter's
heat-shield tiles was below average: 85 dings smaller than one
inch, eight larger ones and one tile requiring replacement.

<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic priest who testified on
behalf of a former homosexual lover on trial on a rape charge has
been relieved of his religious duties.
   The Rev. David R. Johnson, 36, said he knew testifying would
jeopardize his career and devastate his family, but he was
concerned Charles Neff, 22, could be imprisoned for a crime he did
not commit.
   ``I thought to myself, if the Lord could be in my position _
bizarre as it is _ what would he do in my situation?'' Johnson
said. ``Would he not testify, would he testify and lie, or would he
testify and tell the truth?
   ``The choice I came to was testify, tell the truth, only the
truth, and live with what comes afterward.''
   Johnson took the witness stand Thursday in the courtroom of
Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Robert Kelly and testified _ as
did 11 other witnesses _ that Neff was drinking at a bar Nov. 26,
1988, at the time he is alleged to have raped a 21-year-old woman.
   Johnson also testified, under questioning by defense attorney H.
David Rothman, that he and Neff had been lovers.
   Johnson met Friday with Bishop Donald Wuerl of the Catholic
Diocese of Pittsburgh and requested _ and received _ an indefinite
leave of absence.
   He was relieved of all priestly duties and responsibilities,
including his role as chaplain at Forbes Regional Health Center in
suburban Monroeville, said the Rev. Ronald Lengwin, spokesman for
the diocese.
   The diocese plans to review Johnson's actions to determine his
future as a priest, Lengwin said.
   Johnson, 36, a priest for 10 years, said he will return to his
family's home in Pittsburgh. His decision, he said, is best for the
church, his family and himself.
   ``I feel a sense of relief, like a weight has been lifted,'' he
said. ``I want to be there for my parents and my brother.''
   Frank said he met Neff a couple years ago during the Three
Rivers Regatta. Until about a year ago, Johnson said he served as a
counselor, friend and lover to Neff.
   Neff, 22, was charged about a year ago with rape, indecent
assault, simple assault and unlawful restraint. Jurors are expected
to begin deliberations later today after closing arguments.
   Neff has previous convictions for stabbing a girlfriend and
soliciting a city detective for sex. He served 23 months in the
county jail for the stabbing and was placed on probation for a year
for soliciting the detective.

   Oliver Stone's anti-war drama
``Born on the Fourth of July'' got a boost toward Oscardom over the
weekend, winning the top four Golden Globe trophies.
   The Hollywood Foreign Press Association honored ``Born on the
Fourth of July'' for best dramatic movie, best screenplay, best
director for Stone and best dramatic actor for Tom Cruise.
   Ron Kovic, the disabled veteran whose story was the basis of the
film, accepted a trophy for the screenplay he won with Stone at
Saturday's 47th Golden Globes ceremony.
   ``I didn't even know if I was going to get off the field and
live,'' Kovic effused. ``This is the happiest day of my life.''
   Cruise thanked Kovic, ``whose quest for this truth really drove
this film,'' and all the Vietnam veterans who ``gave their souls
for me.''
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' a chronicle of Kovic's
transformation from a patriotic soldier to a war protester, was 12
years in the making, Stone said. ``On nights like this, for just
one fleeting moment, you know you did the right thing,'' he said.
   Golden Globe winners often capture the coveted Academy Awards.
Last year, for example, ``Rain Man'' took two top Golden Globes and
went on to dominate the Oscars.
   Nominations for the Oscars will be announced Feb. 14.
   Another top winner was ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' the account of a
white Southern widow's relationship with her black chauffeur. It
picked up three awards, including best musical or comic motion
picture.
   Michelle Pfeiffer was named best actress in a dramatic motion
picture for ``The Fabulous Baker Boys.''
   ``The Little Mermaid'' won for the best original score and best
original song.
   Julia Roberts, from ``Steel Magnolias,'' was best supporting
actress in a movie and Denzel Washington won best supporting actor
in a movie for ``Glory.''
   Italy's ``Cinema Paradiso'' was named best foreign language film.
   In the television competition, the CBS series ``Murphy Brown''
won as best musical or comic television series, ABC's ``China
Beach'' was named best dramatic TV series and ``Lonesome Dove'' won
for best miniseries or television movie.
   The Golden Globe winners for acting in a dramatic series were
Ken Wahl, the star of ``Wiseguy,'' and Angela Lansbury, who stars
in ``Murder, She Wrote.'' Christine Lahti was named best actress in
a miniseries or TV movie for her performance in ``No Place Like
Home,'' a drama about a homeless family in America.
   Robert Duvall won for best actor in a miniseries or TV movie for
``Lonesome Dove.''
   Other TV awards went to Ted Danson (``Cheers'') and Jamie Lee
Curtis (``Anything But Love''), named best actor and actress in a
television comedy or musical series.
   Amy Madigan captured the Golden Globe for best supporting
actress in a series, miniseries or television movie for the TV
movie ``Roe vs. Wade.'' Dean Stockwell took the prize for best
supporting actor in a series, miniseries or television movie for
his NBC show ``Quantum Leap.''

<TEXT>
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow bowed to
pressure from opposition groups and agreed today to rebuild the
East German government to include pro-democracy groups.
   Modrow's concession came one day after the Communist Party's No.
2 leader quit and called for the party's dissolution.
   The resignation followed an emergency meeting of the embattled
party leadership, which made other moves to placate the populace by
expelling ousted leader Egon Krenz and 13 other former Politburo
members.
   The leadership, which replaced Communist hard-liners last year
during a peaceful popular revolt, has been trying to appease an
opposition movement that is upset with the pace of promised reforms.
   Modrow and opposition leaders also showed rare agreement in
denouncing a report today by the mass-circulation West German
newspaper Bild, which claimed army and secret police agents were
jointly planning a coup.
   Ibrahim Boehme of the influential opposition Social Democratic
Party told politicians a coalition with Communists and other
established parties was possible ``if all parties and groups are
prepared to enter the government on an emergency basis, without
weeks-long negotiations.''
   He made the comment at a session of weekly talks on reform
between the government and opposition groups.
   East Germany's first free elections are to be held on May 6, but
broad differences between the Communist-dominated government and
opposition groups have delayed economic reform measures and
hindered the transition to democracy.
   Modrow today proposed that the fractious political forces meet
Wednesday to consider a new Cabinet.
   ``It is my intention to give a new quality to our cooperation,''
Modrow told representatives of more than a dozen fledgling parties
and reform movements during today's talks between the government
and the opposition. ``Our expectation of your constructive advice
underscores this intention.''
   ``I appeal to the representatives of the new parties at the
round table ... to enter the government as Cabinet members in order
to form a broad coalition,'' Modrow said.
   With his offer, Modrow has made clear that the Communists are
willing to give up some of the ministerial posts they control to
allow groups such as New Forum, the Social Democrats and other
unofficial parties to gain a role in government.
   Communists now dominate the 27-member Cabinet led by Modrow,
with 16 ministerial posts compared with four for the officially
approved Liberal Democrats, three for the Christian Democrats and
two each for the National Democrats and the farmers' party.
   Opposition groups have indicated they would take part in running
the government only if they are offered ministerial posts.
   The Communists' attempt to keep their party from collapsing were
compounded by Sunday's announcement that their No. 2 official,
Wolfgang Berghofer, had abandoned the party with an ``urgent
demand'' for the party's dissolution.
   Berghofer, 46, the party's deputy chairman since December and a
leading popular reformer, resigned along with 39 other prominent
party members from Dresden, of which he is mayor.
   The moves were expected to trigger mass defections from the
party. Its membership in the country of 16.3 million people has
plunged to 1.2 million from nearly 2.3 million in 1987.
   In a statement broadcast on West German's ARD television,
Berghofer said: ``The citizens of the German Democratic Republic
need trust and courage for the future, since tens of thousands are
still leaving their homeland.''
   About 30,000 East Germans have moved to West Germany this year,
following an exodus of more than 340,000 in 1989.
   In his statement, Berghofer said he and the other party
defectors would support ``social democratic'' principles. He is
widely reported to be moving to the opposition Social Democratic
party.
   Government television said Berghofer's move put the party's
future in ``extreme danger.''
   Modrow also announced the resignation of Communist Finance
Minister Uta Nickel, the target of a criminal inquiry into alleged
financial irregularities. Ms. Nickel has denied wrongdoing.
   The Hamburg-based Bild newspaper, in contending a coup was in
the works, said a general strike could be used as the pretext for
an armed takeover.
   ``I must decisively reject as provocation a report in today's
Bild newspaper,'' Modrow said at the government-opposition talks
today.
   Boehme of the Social Democratic party said the Bild report
undermines public confidence in the government. New Forum delegate
Ingrid Koeppe also criticized the report.
   About 60,000 anti-Communist protesters marched across the border
Sunday to West Germany and back. ARD said about 60,000 people took
part in the march across the border at Duderstadt near the West
German city Goettingen. Police in Goettingen put the figure at
between 20,000 to 25,000.
   Through their purges, the Communists appeared to be trying to
further distance themselves from the repressive rule of Erich
Honecker.
   At a day-long meeting that ended early Sunday, the Communists
rejected demands to disband but offered the opposition
``co-responsibility'' in the government until the May elections.
   Krenz immediately appealed his expulsion. After replacing
Honecker, he quickly opened the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9 and promised
democratic reform. But he was ousted after six weeks in office.

   A Communist Party official today
called on other disenchanted members to begin talks on forming a
new political group more willing to embrace democracy.
   Slobodan Lang, a delegate to an important party congress to
discuss the organization's fate, is among five delegates who have
proposed that the party split into a reform-oriented Socialist
Party and a traditional Communist Party.
   Lang called for Communists attending the national congress,
which moved into its third day today, to meet and discuss the
measure.
   The congress has been marked by bitter debate between
hard-liners seeking to slow the pace of political change and
liberals who say the Communists must give up their guaranteed
leading role in society or risk intensified popular unrest.
   Communist government leaders say that whatever the outcome of
the congress, they will press on with the introduction of a
multiparty system and organize free elections for April in the
Balkan nation of 23 million people.
   Debate was to begin today on amendments to a key reform document
that declares the prty's willingness to relinquish its monopoly on
power.
   The daily newspaper Vecernje Novosti said Lang and other
reformers want the document also to declare the Communists'
intention to divide into two parties.
   Communists from the liberal republic of Slovenia have urged that
the party transform itself into a loose coalition of regional
Communist parties in this nation of six federated republics and two
provinces.
   Such a move would radically transform Yugoslav politics,
significantly reducing the power of the national Communist Party,
which has run the country for all its 44 years but is gradually
losing its grip in more liberal regions.
   Opponents of ending the Communist monopoly in the non-aligned
country contend party unity is vital to the unity of Yugoslavia,
which is facing its worst economic crisis and is beset by ethnic
rivalries.
   They are led by delegates from Serbia, the country's largest
republic, who want to maintain strong centralized control of the
economic and political system.
   Vice Premier Zivko Pregl warned Sunday that the government would
not allow the fate of the nation to ``be decided in quarrels among
people representing 10 percent of the population,'' referring to
the 2 million party members.
   He said the government intends to press ahead with the April
elections under a multiparty system and that the Communists in the
future will only ``be relevant to the extent they succeed in
elections.''
   A draft of the document outlining changes in the party's status
declares its willingness to support free elections and the
formation of independent political groups.
   Slovenia has long supported greater pluralism and was the first
to announce plans to hold free elections. Its delegation wanted the
reform document adopted immediately.
   But Serbian delegates said they preferred its adoption in a
package with other resolutions, in an apparent attempt to lessen
its impact.
   The head of the Communist-led popular organization, Socialist
Alliance in Slovenia, Joze Smole said today that Slovenia had a
mandate from its party to adopt the document.
   He said if it were not passed by the congress, there was a
strong possibility the Slovenian delegation might walk out of the
meeting.
   In debate Sunday, Serbia's populist president, Slobodan
Milosevic, reiterated his support for a strong Communist Party.
   He charged that those seeking decentralization of the party were
calling for ``a war among Yugoslav Communists and ... a war among
Yugoslav nations.''
   ``We don't have a united Communist Party, it is only a farce,''
responded Slovenian delgate Milos Ciric. ``We don't want to impose
our liberal model on Serbia, and we will not allow Serbia to impose
its model on us either.''
   Delegate Branko Horvat, leader of the newly organized Union of
Yugoslavs for Democratic Initiative, suggested the party to divide
in two groups _ ``democratic socialists'' and ``non-democratic
authoritarians.''
   He said the party had ``destroyed unity'' in the country.
   Several independent political groups and parties announced their
formation over the weekend, bringing the number of such
organizations to 70.

Azerbaijanis crossing border; picks up 3rd pvs, `A trickle...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops were posted along Iran's border
with the embattled Soviet republic of Azerbaijan to prevent people
from crossing the frontier, Tehran radio said today.
   The report, monitored in Nicosia, said Soviet Moslems from
Azerbaijan who had crossed into Iran for visits would be allowed
back, but no one else would be allowed through.
   It did not specify whether the Soviet Union or Iran deployed
troops to seal the border.
   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass said ``Azerbaijanis and
Iranians continue to cross the border en masse in both directions''
on parts of the border but other sections have been ``stabilized.''
   It said Soviet and Iranian frontier guard commissars met at the
border town of Astara to decide what measures should be taken to
secure the frontier, but the report did not specify what agreement,
if any, had been reached.
   A trickle of visitors from the Soviet province _ who share a
common language, culture and religion with their kin across the
Iranian border _ began after Soviet Azerbaijanis demonstrated in
early January to demand the border be opened.
   Border guards on both sides ignored the crossings.
   The trickle turned into a flood of more than 20,000 over the
past four days, the radio reported, after clashes between Christian
Armenians and Moslem Azerbaijanis in the southern Soviet Union
erupted in violence and the Soviet army intervened to stop the
fighting.
   While the earlier crossings were on the western part of the
400-mile border across the Araks river, over the past week
thousands have come across at the Caspian Sea city of Astara and
nearby Bilehsavar.
   Tehran radio said the troops were deployed this morning to stop
the flow, with only those two points open to allow the Soviet
Moslems to return home.
   Iranian leaders had welcomed the Soviet visitors with open arms
and cautioned Moscow to use peaceful means rather than violence to
stem the fighting.
   But with thousands of refugees streaming across the border,
Tehran fears passions among its own 15 million Azerbaijanis could
be aroused.
   Nationalists in mineral-rich Soviet Azerbaijan want to secede
from the Soviet Union and unite with Iranian Azerbaijan. The ethnic
region was once part of Persia until Russian expansion under the
tsars eventually forced its division in 1828.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday blamed Moslem
fanatics for the violence, echoing long-held Soviet fears that
Iran's revolutionary zealots would seek to inflame the 70 million
Moslems who live in the Soviet Union's southern republics.
   Soviet media said Iran had been supplying arms to the Moslems in
Azerbaijan, which the Iranian media denied.
   Iran on Sunday called on the Soviet Union to halt ``violent
clashes'' with Moslems in Azerbaijan, Iran television reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said President Hashemi
Rafsanjani instructed Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati to ``take
serious steps to solve problems and end bloodshed and violence'' in
the Moslem republic that borders northwest Iran.
   The violence erupted when a simmering feud between the
Azerbaijanis and the Armenians flared again Jan. 13 over control of
the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. The region has been part
of Azerbaijan since 1923.
   Iran, which proclaimed itself to be the beacon for the world's 1
billion Moslems, says harsh measures against the Azerbaijanis by
Moscow would anger the world's Moslems.
   But the leadership appears to be also reluctant to damage its
relations with Moscow while it seeks to revitalize its battered
economy following the 1988 cease-fire in the eight-year war with
Iraq.

   The abortive debut of a cigarette aimed
primarily at blacks suggests that there are new limits to tobacco
marketing.
   R. J. Reynolds Co., the country's second-largest tobacco
company, announced Friday that it was canceling plans to use
Philadelphia as a test market for Uptown, a low-menthol cigarette
designed to lure black smokers. The plans had so enraged
Philadelphia leaders they organized a grass-roots opposition
movement that attracted the attention of the Bush administration.
   Although Reynolds officials say they haven't given up on Uptown,
they concede that they'll have to find another way to market the
brand if they decide to keep it. And other tobacco companies may
face new criticism over their old strategy of marketing to women.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, who was
among the strongest critics of Uptown, said last week that he also
plans to attack cigarette companies that target women.
   ``We should be doing things to improve the health of our
citizens, not impairing the health,'' he said. ``So that when a
tobacco company profits from this, indeed the rest of society _ our
insurance companies, our hospitals, our companies _ also hurt.''
   Charyn Sutton, marketing consultant for the American Lung
Association, noted that lung cancer recently became the No. 1
cancer in women.
   The possibility of a rise in lung cancer among blacks ``is a
very scary, scary prospect and especially when you look at a
community already overburdened with smoking-related diseases,''
Sutton said. ``If you give black people a cigarette of their own,
death rates will go into the stratosphere.''
   Black men have a 58 percent higher incidence of lung cancer than
white men, according to the U.S. Public Health Service. And
compared with whites, blacks lose twice as many years of life
because of smoking-related diseases.
   The Rev. Jesse Brown, president of the Philadelphia-based
Committee to Prevent Cancer Among Blacks, said the Uptown protest
was designed to say to R.J. Reynolds: ``We do not need another
instrument of destruction to come into the African-American
community.''
   After dropping the Philadelphia test, a spokesman for Reynolds
admitted the company's strategy may have been flawed.
   ``Maybe in retrospect we would have been better off not saying
we were marketing to blacks. But those were the smokers we were
going after, so why shouldn't we be honest about it?'' David B.
Fishel told The New York Times.
   Rather than simply feature black models in its advertisements
for Uptown, Reynolds openly announced its intentions. According to
Brown, that may have been Uptown's downfall.
   Brown said he doubted the opponents would have been as enraged
if the company had taken a more subtle approach, quietly putting up
billboards in black neighborhoods and advertising in black
publications.
   ``We saw something big coming down the pike ... and a lot of
people were incensed about it,'' he said. ``The key was that they
said they were going to target African-Americans, and it (the
cigarette) is deadly.''
   The American Cancer Society in Philadelphia started making plans
to block the test market around New Year's, shortly after it was
announced, said Dr. Carl Mansfield, the local cancer society
president.
   Within a week, the Coalition Against Uptown Cigarettes was
formed. Nearly 30 religious, health and black community groups
joined.
   The uproar reached a peak when Sullivan last week asked Reynolds
to halt the campaign of ``slick and sinister advertising.''
   But marketing consumer products, especially cigarettes, to
specific groups is not new.
   Philip Morris Co.'s Virginia Slims defined women as a lucrative
cigarette market.
   Many have linked the increase in smoking among women with the
introduction of Virginia Slims and its competitors. In 1986, lung
cancer surpassed breast cancer as the most prevalent cancer in
women.
   ``One of the things we felt clearly was this (the Uptown
campaign) was a replication of a marketing strategy they had
success with in selling cigarettes to women,'' Sutton said.
   Unlike the Uptown protest, Sutton said women's groups didn't
oppose Virginia Slims in part because Philip Morris underwrote many
women's activities, particularly sports.
   The tobacco industry has been vying for the loyalties of smaller
and smaller segments of a shrinking smoking public by offering
specialized brands.
   Reynolds' Premier, a smokeless cigarette that produced few
ashes, failed in test markets in 1989 after some smokers complained
it had a peculiar taste and aroma.
   Philip Morris later introduced Superslims, a cigarette the
company says emits 70 percent less smoke.
   With its Uptown campaign, Reynolds ran a risk of reawakening the
lingering desires to ban all cigarette advertising, said Jack
Trout, a partner in Trout &amp; Ries, Greenwich, Conn.-based marketing
consultants.
   ``For the few tiny dollars they are going to pick up by
penetrating the black market they are going to enrage everyone. ...
It just gives ammunition to the anti's,'' Trout said shortly before
Reynolds canceled the test market.
   Reynolds spokeswoman Maura Payne said the company could decide
on the cigarette's fate sometime this week, although it would not
immediately decide the time or location of a test market.

<HEAD>Japan Ready to Send Spacecraft to Moon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists made final inspections of a three-stage
rocket today as Japan prepared to become the third nation to send a
spacecraft to the moon.
   ``Our staffs have almost finished the final check of electrical
systems of the spacecraft. So far, everything's perfect,'' said
Tadashige Takiya, a spokesman for the Institute of Space and
Astronautical Science in Kagoshima in southern Japan.
   If Tuesday's flight is successful, Japan's Muses-A would be the
first spacecraft to visit the moon since the Soviet Union landed
the unmanned vehicle Luna 24 on its surface in 1976. The United
States is the only other nation that has sent spacecraft to the
moon.
   The launch is scheduled at 8:48 p.m. (6:48 a.m. EST) Tuesday
from the Kagoshima Space Center, Takiya said.
   The plan is to send the Muses-A into a highly elliptical Earth
orbit that will bring it about 10,000 miles from the moon on March
18.
   Japanese space centers are incapable of tracing the flight all
the way, so centers in Canberra, Australia, and at California
Institute of Technology will help, Takiya said.
   The craft is to release a smaller satellite just before crossing
the moon's orbit. A ``kick motor'' aboard the smaller craft will
propel it into a lunar orbit, the institute said.
   The smaller satellite is to send data to the mother satellite on
space temperatures and electric fields, while the mother satellite
continues circling Earth, swinging by the moon and collecting data
on space dust and other phenomena.
   The government-funded flight will be the 13th satellite launched
by Japan and the fifth use of the M3S-2 rocket.
   The Japanese rocket, an M3S-2 made by Nissan Motor Co., is a
three-stage, solid-fuel rocket that weighs 62 tons.
   Japan's rocket program has shown a high success rate, but last
August, the National Space Development Agency had its first failure
in 20 launchings when the first stage of an H-1 rocket failed to
ignite.

   Three active homosexuals have been ordained
as Lutheran priests, an unprecedented act that brought joy to some
of their parishioners and threats of expulsion from church
officials.
   Jeff Johnson, 27, was installed Sunday as assistant pastor at
the First United Lutheran Church in San Francisco's working-class
Richmond District. Ruth Frost, 42, and Phyllis Zillhart, 32, were
installed in the same roles at St. Francis Lutheran Church near the
largely gay Castro District.
   ``This is not something new; we are already part of the church
... and now we want to be recognized for the gifts we offer,''
Zillhart said at a weekend news conference.
   All three of the new ministers were removed from a list of
ordainable clergy after they refused to agree to celibacy, often
required of known homosexual pastors but not of heterosexual ones
in the Lutheran denomination.
   The dissident churches, one of them with no known homosexual
members and both with heterosexual head pastors, agreed to hire the
three last month. The congregations have been threatened with
expulsion by the 5.2 million Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America, which has warned it will not recognize the new ministers.
   ``We see this as what God is asking us to do,'' said the Rev.
John Frykman of First United. ``Our congregation felt this was a
social justice issue, that gays are part of the rainbow coalition
of God's creation.''
   ELCA spokesman Joseph Wagner countered that ordination is ``not
a civil right. It is a privilege granted by the church to those who
meet its established standards.''
   The two congregations hope the gay ministers can bring many
homosexuals back to the flock. Among other things, the three
endorsed the concept of ``gay marriages.''
   Their Saturday ordinations _ along with that of a New Jersey
Episcopal pastor last month with an acknowledged male mate _
represent a historic foothold in mainstream Christianity by
homosexuals, whose sexual orientation generally has been tolerated
only if it wasn't consummated.
   The ELCA, formed two years ago by the merger of three Lutheran
groups, bans ordination of ``self-avowed, practicing homosexuals.''
It is the largest American Lutheran denomination. Lutherans in
several northern European countries allow ordination of practicing
homosexuals.
   At the request of Sierra-Pacific Synod Bishop Lyle Miller, a
disciplinary committee will consider punitive action against the
congregations. The parishes could be censured, suspended,
permanently removed from the church organization or exonerated.
   The Rev. James DeLange of St. Francis said his congregation felt
that to deny the ``pastoral ministry of a lesbian couple is akin to
denying a black congregation the right to call a black pastor.'' Up
to 100,000 gays and lesbians live within a mile of the century-old
church.
   ``We decided that punishment, even expulsion, is a risk we would
run for the sake of what's right,'' DeLange said.
   Zillhart and Frost, a couple who studied together at Luther
Northwestern Seminary, and Johnson, who graduated last year from
Pacific Lutheran Seminary in Berkeley, Calif., also will manage an
outreach program for Northern California homosexuals.
   George Cooper, a 52-year-old former Roman Catholic priest who
left because of his homosexuality, wiped a tear from his eye
following the ordination, saying, ``this is Christianity, the
triumph of love for each other over ignorance.''

   Moslem snipers fired at Indian troops
from rooftops today and at least two people were killed and 300
injured in clashes between soldiers and Islamic militants,
officials said.
   About 500 armed state policemen holed up in a police complex
after a confrontation with the army and refused to continue the
crackdown against the militants.
   ``The whole city is up in revolt,'' said Srinagar police
inspector general Mohammad Nomani.
   The Islamic militants, who want Kashmir state to become
independent or merge with neighboring Pakistan, marched out of
homes and mosques in defiance of a curfew.
   Nomani said at least 40 people, most of them militants, had died
since the violence began late Saturday night in Srinagar, a
predominantly Moslem city.
   He said a paramilitary policeman was killed today by a Moslem
sniper, and one Moslem protester was shot to death by the army.
   At least 300 protesters were injured today when troops fired on
a crowd of about 5,000 in a suburb of Srinagar, doctors at the
Soora Hospital said.
   The doctors, speaking on condition of anonymity, said all beds
in the hospital were occupied and the cafeteria had been converted
into a makeshift hospital.
   Mohammad Aslam, a policeman in the state constabulary, said a
fellow officer was killed by army fire.
   When soldiers refused to hand over his body to the state police,
about 500 armed officers took up positions in residential quarters
of the police complex and refused to report for duty, Aslam said.
   State police said they could not confirm the officer's death and
refused further comment.
   Aslam said the army and the paramilitary Central Reserve Police
Force wanted to disarm the state police, most of whom are Moslems.
The army and the paramilitary forces are mostly Hindu.
   ``We are not slaves,'' he said as his colleagues chanted in the
background: ``Army go back.''
   Thousands of Moslems took to the streets starting shortly before
midnight Saturday after government security forces rounded up
suspected militants. The government said it acted to control
escalating violence.
   Nomani said 251 people had been detained in raids but that all
except four had been released in an attempt to stop the violence.
   He estimated the militants' strength at 1,500 and said they had
at least 1,000 weapons, mostly automatic rifles.
   The city of 1 million was placed under around-the-clock curfew,
with only military vehicles and troops permitted on the streets.
   But bands of 50 to 100 men ignored the curfew today; at least 50
streamed out of one mosque in downtown Srinagar. Some hurled stones
at the troops, while outhers beat their breasts and shouted: ``You
Indians go back.''
   Teen-age boys hauled out an Indian flag and shredded it in front
of the soldiers. As the stones continued to fly, the army opened
fire. One demonstrator fell to the street dead.
   Before the weekend, 26 people had been killed this year in
confrontations involving Moslem militants and security forces.
   In New Delhi today, Foreign Minister Shabzada Yaqub Khan of
Pakistan conferred with Indian officials during a visit scheduled
before the latest violence.
   India has long accused Islamic Pakistan of supporting the
Kashmiri separatists, a charge routinely denied by Pakistan.
   The old princely state of Kashmir was divided between India and
Pakistan when the two countries were partitioned and became
independent from Britain in 1947.
   India and Pakistan have gone to war three times since, the last
time in 1971, but the Kashmir frontier is still under dispute.
   Abdul Qayyum, president of Pakistan's Azad Kashmir state, told a
news conference in Islamabad, Pakistan, today that more violence
could spark thousands to cross the 840-mile border into India.
   ``People are becoming deaf to reason and logic,'' he said.
   He said an alliance of nine political parties in
Pakistani-controlled Kashmir would lead a ``peaceful movement
across the cease-fire line'' if Indian troops continued what he
called a campaign to destroy militant secessionists.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority.
Moslem militants, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, have
demanded independence for Kashmir or union with Moslem Pakistan.
   Sixty-four percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 5 million people are
Moslems, but nationwide Moslems make up only 12 percent of India's
880 million people.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A church leader today accused the
military government of undermining democratic reforms by ordering a
wave of arrests, beatings and the exile of political opponents.
   ``They have made rubbish of the constitution,'' said Roman
Catholic Bishop Willy Romelus on the church-run Radio Soleil. He
encouraged his listeners, however, to keep up their spirits.
   Of Haiti's six main radio stations, only Radio Soleil, the
Protestant Radio Lumiere and the state-run National Radio were
broadcasting news this morning under a state of siege declared by
military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril. Radio is the main source of
news in the country.
   In its toughest crackdown on the opposition since taking power
in a September 1988 soldiers' revolt, the government arrested and
forced into exile seven prominent political activists during the
weekend. Dozens of others were arrested but were thought to have
been released.
   Port-au-Prince, the bustling capital of more than 1 million
people, remained calm. Shops and schools opened as usual and
traffic was normal.
   Critics said the crackdown indicates Avril intends to renege on
a promise to hold free elections in October.
   At a news conference Sunday in Miami, newly exiled activist
Hubert de Ronceray said Avril promised the elections only ``to get
help from foreign countries.''
   ``There's no possibility of a democracy with Mr. Avril. He's a
dictator,'' said the conservative leader.
   The state of siege was declared after an army colonel, his wife
and servants were killed Friday by unidentified gunmen just 100
yards from de Ronceray's home.
   De Ronceray, deported Saturday, claimed he was the intended
victim. Other opposition activists speculated Avril was using the
killings as a pretext to derail the transition to democracy he
promised after coming to power in a September 1988 soldiers' revolt.
   De Ronceray, 65, said that after his arrest he was kicked,
clubbed with guns, and had a cigarette jammed in his eye. The eye
was red as he spoke to reporters.
   The other exiles were also beaten before they were deported,
according to the activists and other sources.
   The government offered no comment on those reports.
   In Washington, the State Department condemned the state of siege
and arrests and urged the Haitian government to reiterate its
commitment to free elections. The United States suspended $60
million in aid to the impoverished country after Haiti's last
attempt at democratic elections was thwarted by armed thugs aided
by soldiers who massacred voters in 1987.
   Louis Roy, a prominent civic leader and an author of Haiti's
1987 constitution, ``was carrying a small suitcase, kissed the
ground two times and mounted the stairway to exile,'' a relative
told The Associated Press.
   Roy, 74, founder of the Haitian Red Cross, flew aboard a
commercial flight to Miami. ``I was hit in both ears and full in
the face in front of the duty officer at the police headquarters,''
he said upon arrival.
   Max Bourjolly, second-in-command of the Haitian Communist party,
was arrested at his home and exiled, apparently to France, said
party leader Rene Theodore.
   Family members and sources who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the others exiled Sunday were Aby Brun of the center-left
Congress for Democratic Movement, Sylvain Jolibois of the small
radical Jean-Jacques Dessalines Group, and radical activists Michel
Legros and Max Montreuil.
   They said Brun was flown to Miami and the others to the
Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola
with Haiti.
   Popular radical leader Sylvio Claude of the Haitian Christian
Democratic Party and Gerard Philippe-Auguste, head of the Movement
to Organize the Country party, went into hiding.
   De Ronceray and Roy are not new to exile. They spent several
years in Montreal during the rule of the late dictator Francois
``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, whose son continued the 29-year family
dynasty until fleeing to France in 1986 after a popular uprising.
   In announcing the state of siege Saturday night, the government
suspended a law forbidding forced exile and renewed an entry visa
requirement for Haitians returning from abroad.
   De Ronceray claimed the colonel killed near his house, Andre
Neptune, was shot by attackers sent out to kill him. He said he had
changed his own schedule because of a warning Avril wanted him
``destroyed,'' and the officer was slain while in a car similar to
his.
   Human rights activist Jean-Claude Bajeux, who arrived in Puerto
Rico from Haiti on Friday, said he suspected either army rivals or
the drug mafia were behind the slayings.
   ``The coincidence is significant. For this killing to happen now
and they immediately use it to round up (opposition leaders), it's
a typically Duvalierist scheme.''
   He was referring to the network of Duvalier supporters left in
this former French colony, where 80 percent of the 5 million people
live in poverty.
   Paul Latortue, a Haitian economist at the University of Puerto
Rico, said the weekend crackdown indicates Avril ``has allied
himself with the Duvalierists,'' whom he accused of killing Neptune.
   ``The government will now either show its teeth and demonstrate
there'll be no elections, or have elections without the
opposition's participation, with controlled candidates,'' Latortue
said.
   Avril rose to power in a revolt that ousted Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy, who oversaw the November 1987 elections that were canceled
when at least 34 voters were shot and hacked to death by thugs in
collusion with soldiers.
   Less than two months later, Namphy staged army-run elections
that were widely boycotted by voters and denounced by most foreign
observers as fraudulent. Several months later, he took back control
of the government.

<HEAD>Court To Decide ``Whistleblowers'' Issue in North Carolina Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether nuclear industry ``whistleblowers'' who say they were
disciplined for complaining about lax safety may sue under state
personal-injury laws.
   The justices said they will review a North Carolina case in
which a federal appeals court said such workers must sue under a
special federal law.
   Another appeals courts has allowed such state-law suits, and the
justices' decision is expected to resolve the conflicting rulings.
   The decision, to be announced by July, will carry a significant
practical effect. The federal law does not provide for
punitive-damages awards, often the most lucrative part of a
successful suit under the corresponding state laws.
   Bush administration lawyers urged reversal of the appeals
court's ruling in the North Carolina case. The federal law ``does
not pre-empt an employee's state (suit) for intentional infliction
of emotional distress resulting from retaliation for making nuclear
safety complaints,'' they said.
   Vera English of Wilmington, N.C., worked as a laboratory
technician for General Electric at its nuclear fuels manufacturing
plant there for almost 12 years before she was fired in July 1984.
   Earlier that year, Ms. English had complained to both the
federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and to her GE supervisors
about what she considered serious violations of federal safety
standards.
   When no corrective action was taken, she deliberately failed to
clean up radiation contamination at her work station in what she
said was an effort to prove that such contamination was not being
detected by safety inspectors.
   Although her efforts led to corrective action, she was
disciplined and eventually fired.
   Ms. English sued GE in 1987. Her suit sought, under North
Carolina law, reinstatement with back pay and monetary damages for
wrongful discharge and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
   Despite being based on state law, Ms. English's suit was filed
in federal court because GE's headquarters are outside the state.
   A federal judge dismissed the state-law suit, ruling that it was
pre-empted by ``whistleblower provisions'' of the federal Energy
Reorganization Act.
   The federal law bars nuclear industry employers from firing or
otherwise disciplining employees for publicly pointing out alleged
safety problems.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal of
Ms. English's suit last April 3.
   In seeking Supreme Court review, Ms. English's lawyers argued
that she ``was treated outrageously and unfairly by General
Electric, yet she has received no compensation for the very serious
wrongs she has suffered.''
   GE lawyers urged rejection of the appeal, saying that allowing
such suits would frustrate ``a pervasive and delicately balanced
regulatory scheme'' created by Congress.''
   In a recent interview, one of Ms. English's lawyers, M. Travis
Payne of Raleigh, N.C., said she no longer has the option of filing
a suit against GE based on the federal law.
   In a separate administrative proceeding, a Labor Department
administrative law judge ruled for Ms. English. The judge awarded
her reinstatement with back pay, $70,000 in damages and lawyer
fees, but the ruling was set aside by the secretary of labor on
grounds Ms. English waited too long to file her complaint.
   The case is English vs. General Electric, 89-152.

<TEXT>
   A Bibb County, Ga., school bond referendum
attacked by blacks as a violation of the federal Voting Rights Act
was legal, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The court, without waiting to hear arguments in the case, upheld
a ruling that permitted the county's voters to approve $29 million
to air-condition existing schools and build a new high school.
   The justices' decision was not accompanied by any written
opinion. There was no recorded dissenting vote.
   Blacks in the county, who favored the air conditioning but
opposed the new school, said permitting both proposals to be voted
on together was racially biased. They said the proposed school in a
predominantly white area would require busing black students to
attend classes there.
   The blacks sought, under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to have
the U.S. attorney general review the referendum proposal before it
was placed on the ballot _ a process called pre-clearance.
   But a special three-judge federal court ruled last year that the
school board's decision to link the air conditioning and a new
school in a single bond issue is not the kind of voting change
requiring pre-clearance.
   The three-judge court acknowledged that the Supreme Court has
upheld pre-clearance for setting election dates, changing candidate
qualifications and altering voting procedures.
   But the panel, agreeing with legal arguments submitted by the
Justice Department, said defining the scope of a bond issue
proposal ``is a routine matter for the (school) board to decide.''
   Those who challenged the referendum format said, ``The method
the board chose submerged the political will of Bibb County's black
voters. Voters favoring all or none of the bond issues were able to
cast a fully effective ballot. Those voters who were divided on the
issues were not.''
   The challengers said there was racially polarized voting over
the bond issue and that the school board scheduled the election to
reduce the chances of a proportionally larger turnout by blacks
over whites.
   They said the school board rescinded a plan to submit the bond
issue to voters on March 8, 1988 _ so-called Super Tuesday in last
year's presidential primaries when the civil rights leader Jesse
Jackson was on the Georgia ballot.
   On that date, 11,375 blacks and 23,706 whites in Bibb County
voted. When the bond issue was approved on Election Day, Nov. 8,
1988, 14,731 blacks and 35,153 whites voted.
   The bond issue passed, 21,915 votes to 21,287.
   Asked for its views in the case, the Bush administration urged
the high court to uphold the three-judge court's ruling.
   The case is Lucas vs. Townsend, 89-400.

<HEAD>Court to Use Haitian Dispute to Decide Legal Fees Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to use a
decade-long dispute over the rights of Haitian refugees to decide
when the government must pay legal fees to people who sue it
successfully.
   The court said it will hear a Bush administration appeal aimed
at limiting such fees.
   The refugees sued the government in 1981 over its policy of
locking up aliens caught while trying to enter the United States
illegally.
   Until 1981, the government generally released aliens on
``parole'' pending hearings on their applications for official
admission to the country.
   The Haitians said they almost never were paroled before their
applications were acted upon, a process that can take longer than a
year.
   The refugees accused the government of discriminating against
them because they are black, and also contended that the
Immigration and Naturalization Service violated federal rules by
summarily adopting harsher treatment for Haitians than other aliens.
   The refugees ultimately won an important, though not total,
victory.
   They did not win on the discrimination claim but the government
conceded that the INS may not consider race or national origin in
determining parole. New rules were adopted for handling refugees.
   Federal courts that reviewed the case said there is no doubt the
Haitians won their freedom because of the lawsuit. Those refugees
later returned to custody were detained under new, fairer rules,
the lower courts said.
   The government has argued that the Haitians did not win key
elements of their lawsuit and should not be entitled to recover
legal fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act.
   The act generally requires reimbursement of legal fees for those
who prevail in suits against the government.
   A federal judge ruled against the government on the fees
question, awarding more than $1 million to the lawyers who
represented the Haitians.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year substantially
upheld the judge's decision, while ordering further hearings to
recompute the amount owed the lawyers.
   The appeals court also said the government must reimburse the
Haitians' lawyers for fees they incurred litigating the fees issue
in the first place _ what the appeals court called the ``fees for
fees'' issue.
   ``We hold that the United States may not oppose a `fees for
fees' request solely on the ground that its position in the fee
litigation was substantially justified,'' the 11th Circuit court
said.
   That issue prompted the Bush administration's appeal to the
Supreme Court acted on today.
   Justice Department lawyers said the 11th Circuit court ruling
conflicts with decisions by other federal appeals courts.
   The case is Commissioner of INS vs. Jean, 89-601.

<TEXT>
   Coast Guard officials have decided to let
nature clean up the estimated 57,600 gallons of gasoline that
gushed into Alaska's island-studded Inside Passage from a grounded
tanker.
   The Canadian-owned tanker Frank H. Brown struck Burnt Island
Reef on Saturday night. The captain, who was not identified, blamed
the grounding on ``a judgment error,'' Coast Guard spokesman Ed
Moreth said.
   The agency said it took blood and urine samples from crew
members to test for drug or alcohol use.
   The 400-foot ship was refloated at high tide Sunday and
continued under its own power about 15 miles up a narrow channel to
Scow Bay, just south of Petersburg. There, divers found a 2-foot
hole in one of its tanks.
   Lt. Brian Flory of the Coast Guard said the vessel remained at
anchor overnight.
   ``It has boom all around it,'' Flory said early today. ``The
remaining cargo was transferred out of the damaged tank. There's no
recoverable gasoline anywhere.''
   Coast Guard and state environmental officials said damage to
fish and wildlife appeared to be minimal. The decision not to clean
up the spill was made Sunday as the gasoline quickly broke up into
several thin sheens, the largest a mile long.
   ``It's just not recoverable,'' Moreth said. ``The stuff seems to
be evaporating quicker than anyone could pick it up, and it's only
in small patches scattered around.''
   The spill was a fraction of the size of the Exxon Valdez
disaster, in which nearly 11 million gallons of heavy crude oil
spilled into Prince William Sound last March in the nation's worst
oil spill. The Valdez captain, Joseph Hazelwood, goes on trial next
week.
   The site of Saturday's spill is about 135 miles south of Juneau
in a channel called Wrangell Narrows. The tanker carried 1.8
million gallons of gasoline, diesel fuel and heating oil, but only
one tank was ruptured.
   ``It's not a heavy fuel, so it has a tendency to break up easily
and it weathers much faster than a heavier oil,'' Coast Guard
spokesman Greg Robinson said.
   The tanker is owned by White Pass Transportation Inc. of
Vancouver, British Columbia. It was heading from Vancouver to
Skagway, 210 miles north of Petersburg.
   Wrangell Narrows is a windy, 25-mile long channel between Sumner
Strait and Frederick Sound. It is one of the narrowest waterways
between the thickly forested and mountainous islands that form the
Inside Passage.
   An estimated 20,000 gallons of gasoline remained in the damaged
tank and was removed Sunday night to a nearby barge at Scow Bay.
Boom totaling 1,050 feet was placed around the two vessels to
contain any further leakage.
   The vessel may be allowed to continue to Skagway with the rest
of its load today. The damage is not enough to affect the tanker's
maneuverability, Moreth said.
   The spill was not expected to pose a health risk to people
living along the channel, said Barbara Holian, a spokeswoman for
the state Department of Environmental Conservation in Juneau. She
said spilled gasoline does not remain highly toxic for long because
it evaporates quickly.
   The state's Crystal Lake Hatchery 15 miles south of Petersburg
was not threatened by the spill, said fish culturist Bill Davidson
at the salmon hatchery. There are no fish runs in the area until
spring, he said.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Require Arbitration for Federal Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to require
arbitration for hundreds of thousands of federal workers when they
are fired, demoted or otherwise disciplined.
   The court, without comment, rejected appeals by a labor union
and the Federal Labor Relations Authority seeking broader job
protection for federal employees.
   At issue were the rights of as many as 450,000 employees known
as ``excepted'' workers because they hold their jobs without having
to take civil service tests.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last May that the
Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 does not require government
agencies to bargain over creation of grievance arbitration
procedure for the excepted workers.
   ``Congress carefully constructed a scheme that would ensure
uniformity in personnel decisions and promote efficiency of
administration,'' the appeals court said. Requiring arbitration for
excepted workers ``would undermine the structure'' of the law, that
court said.
   The May ruling was a defeat for the National Treasury Employees
Union, which sought to extend arbitration protection to employees
in the chief counsel's office of the Internal Revenue Service.
   The Bush administration supported the appeals court ruling, but
Justice Department lawyers noted that Congress is considering
amending civil service law to expand job protection for excepted
employees.
   The cases are National Treasury Employees Union vs. Treasury
Department, 89-610, and Federal Labor Relations Authority vs.
Treasury Department, 89-758.

<HEAD>Administration Asked for Views on Massachusetts Regulation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today asked the Bush
administration for its view as to whether stockbrokers may be
forced to give investors the option of suing, rather than seeking
arbitration, over alleged broker fraud.
   The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyers
about a ruling that barred Massachusetts from requiring brokers to
make arbitration clauses optional, not mandatory, in brokerage
contracts.
   The justices are not expected to take any action in the
Massachusetts case until hearing from the government lawyers, which
could take months.
   The Massachusetts appeal is supported by 30 other states, whose
officials said a federal appeals court ruling leaves them
``powerless to protect consumers from being coerced to enter
arbitration agreements.''
   The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last
Aug. 31 that the Massachusetts regulations are pre-empted by
federal law.
   The prevailing practice in the brokerage industry is to require
customers to agree to arbitrate all disputes as a condition to
opening an account.
   The justices ruled 5-4 in 1987 that if such arbitration clauses
are in the contracts signed by investors, disputes over alleged
fraud are to be resolved in arbitration, not in lawsuits.
   Massachusetts' secretary of state in 1988 imposed regulations
prohibiting brokers from making arbitration agreements
non-negotiable conditions for opening accounts. The regulations
also required brokers to tell customers about the legal effects of
mandatory arbitration clauses.
   The state's action immediately was challenged by the Securities
Industry Association and 10 brokerage firms affiliated with it.
   A federal judge ruled for the brokers, and the appeals court
upheld that ruling.
   ``The long and short of it is that we can find no evidence of a
clear congressional command to override the unambiguous
pro-arbitration mandate of the (Federal Arbitration Act) in the
securities field,'' the appeals court said.
   In the state's appeal, Massachusetts Attorney General James M.
Shannon said the August ruling ``has national implications for
state regulation of mandatory arbitration agreements in banking,
health care, (the) automobile and many other industries.''
   Shannon said the Federal Arbitration Act does not pre-empt all
state regulation of arbitration.
   Lawyers for the securities industry urged the justices to reject
the state's appeal.
   The case is Connolly vs. Securities Industry Association, 89-894.

<TEXT>
   Ethiopian rebels today released the crew
of a Polish cargo ship that had been attacked on suspicion it was
carrying arms to Ethiopian government forces, Sudan's official news
agency reported.
   The 30 Poles were turned over to a Sudanese military team at the
border with Ethiopia and taken to Port Sudan, the country's major
port on the Red Sea, for a flight home on plane provided by the
Polish government, the Sudan News Agency said.
   The report quoted Ali Shummo, minister of information and
culture.
   Guerrillas said they attacked the 8,137-ton Polish freighter
Boleslaw Krzywousty on Jan. 3 as it steamed from Port Sudan to
Massawa, a port in the northern Ethiopian province of Eritrea.
   A guerrilla spokesman contacted from Bahrain on Jan. 7 said the
freighter was one of two ships the rebels attacked on suspicion
they carried arms to Ethiopia's Marxist government. The attacks
were apparently from shore gun batteries.
   The spokesman gave no details of what became of the two ships
and their crews. But shipping sources in the Persian Gulf said they
received information that the Boleslaw Krzywousty was stranded and
ablaze 50 miles from Massawa.
   It was not clear how the crew members of the Boleslaw Krzywousty
fell into rebel hands _ whether the crew was captured after
abandoning ship or whether they were seized from the ship by the
guerrillas.
   In Cairo, a Polish Embassy spokesman speaking on condition of
anonymity said the released Poles are 29 crew members and the wife
of one of them.
   He said they were handed over to Peter Vanau, who headed a
Polish government team that negotiated the release with rebel
representatives.
   The Boleslaw Krzywousty is a general cargo ship owned by the
Polish Shipping Association.
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front has been fighting for
nearly three decades for independence for the Eritrean province.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
federal civil rights lawsuit by five people prosecuted for
anti-abortion picketing outside a San Diego medical clinic.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a decision dismissing
allegations that the clinic's operators violated the pickets'
free-speech rights.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last June 23 threw out
$11,800 awards each of the five pickets had won in a federal trial.
   James Collins Jr., Tammy Lee Collins, Kimberlee Huckaby, Joan
Patton and Cheryl Sullenger sued over an Oct. 1, 1985, incident at
the Womencare clinic.
   On that day, a group of protesters demonstrated across the
street from the clinic. Some of them were subject to a state court
injunction, issued about a year earlier, that barred them from
demonstrating or picketing ``any closer than across the street''
from the clinic's property.
   The five people involved in this case picketed on the public
sidewalk on Womencare's side of the street.
   Two clinic employees summoned police who, after talking with the
pickets, decided to take no action. But San Diego Police Sgt.
Thomas Packer told the clinic employees they could make ``citizen's
arrests'' under California law, charging the pickets with violating
the 1984 injunction.
   The two employees, accompanied by police officers, placed the
five pickets under arrest. Police detained the group long enough to
issue misdemeanor citations for violating the injunction.
   The five pickets were not subject to the 1984 injunction, and
the charges were dropped prior to trial. They subsequently sued, in
federal court, the clinic's owners and the two employees who
arrested them.
   The suit, involving a much-used civil rights law, alleged false
arrest and free-speech violations.
   A jury ruled for the pickets, but the 9th Circuit court threw
out the jury's award.
   The appeals court said the arrests made by the two clinic
employees did not amount to action taken ``under the color of state
law,'' and therefore could not be the basis for the civil rights
suit.
   The appeals court sent back the false-arrest claim for a retrial.
   The case is Collins vs. Womancare, 89-819.

<HEAD>Court to Rule on Boat Owner Liability in Indiana Case</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to settle a
dispute over how much money pleasure boat owners may be required to
pay for damages in some boating accidents.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by the owner of a yacht
destroyed in a fire while docked at a Lake Michigan marina in
Indiana.
   The accident occurred Sept. 24, 1985, when a fire broke out
aboard Everett Sisson's 56-foot yacht, the Ultorian. It caused
extensive damage to the Washington Park Marina in Michigan City,
Ind., and other boats docked there.
   The fire was believed to have been caused by a defective washer
and dryer aboard the yacht.
   The owners of the marina and the other damaged boats sued for
more than $275,000.
   Sisson, whose boat was valued at about $600,000 before the fire,
said he should be required to pay the others no more than $800 _
the Ultorian's value after the fire.
   His arguments for restricting the damages were based on maritime
and admiralty laws that protect ship owners from having to pay big
court awards in lawsuits.
   But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that
the liability limits do not apply when the accident is caused by a
pleasure boat moored at a recreational marina.
   The appeals court said the liability limits only apply ``to
cases directly involving commercial maritime activity or to cases
involving exclusively non-commercial activities in which the wrong
has a potentially disruptive impact on martime commerce and
involves ... navigation.''
   The appeals court based its ruling in part on a 1982 Supreme
Court ruling in a case in which two pleasure boats collided.
   ``This may be too narrow and mechanical an interpretation of the
Supreme Court'' decision, the appeals court said. ``But the
specific language of the court seems to support it. If the Ultorian
had been under way in the shipping channel when the fire broke out,
we might reach a different result.''
   Bush administration lawyers urged that Sisson's appeal be
granted and his case be used to clear up uncertainty over the issue.
   The 1982 decision ``provides modest guidance with respect to
cases that do not involve navigation or commercial shipping,''
Justice Department lawyers said.
   The case is Sisson vs. Ruby, 88-2041.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Unions Get Addresses from Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let public
employee labor unions get from the government the home addresses of
federal workers.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the
workers' privacy would be violated if government agencies are
forced to divulge the information to the unions.
   The Federal Labor Relations Authority, in a series of decisions,
said unions are entitled to the names and addresses of the workers
they represent in collective bargaining.
   The authority said withholding the information is an unfair
labor practice, noting that labor law requires private employers to
give unions the addresses of workers they represent.
   There is little privacy right in keeping one's home address a
secret from the union since the recipient of union mail is free to
throw it away unopened, the labor authority said.
   Disclosing the addresses will ``contribute to the union's
ability to communicate effectively with its bargaining unit
employees,'' added the authority, which handles disputes between
government employee unions and their employers.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here overturned the labor
authority's ruling last September, saying workers' privacy rights
outweigh the unions' need for the information _ particularly since
there are other ways for the unions to communicate with employees.
   In the appeals acted on today, the unions said they should be
allowed to communicate with members in the privacy of the workers'
homes and be allowed to recruit new members by mail.
   In ruling against the unions, the appeals court relied in part
on a 1989 Supreme Court decision that said the FBI is not required
by the Freedom of Information Act to reveal ``rap sheets''
containing arrest and conviction records of millions of Americans.
   ``Federal employees have privacy interests in their names and
home addresses that must be protected, and the relevant public
interest in disclosure, though not nothing, is outweighed,'' the
appeals court said.
   Bush administration lawyers asked the justices not to disturb
the appeals court's ruling.
   In a related case last year, the high court ordered the St.
Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to study the issue
further.
   The cases are American Federation of Government Employees vs.
Department of Health and Human Services, 89-444; National Treasury
Employees Union vs. Treasury Department, 89-566; and Federal Labor
Relations Authority vs. Treasury Department, 89-853.

<HEAD>California Church Loses Property-Rights Bid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California church that won a major Supreme
Court property-rights case in 1987 today lost a follow-up bid to be
compensated for losing the use of its land.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that Los
Angeles County officials are not required to pay the church for any
losses it suffered.
   The church, First English Evangelical Lutheran in Glendale,
Calif., operated a camp called Lutherglen on 21 acres of land in
the mountains north of Los Angeles.
   Forest fires in the summer of 1977 burned off much of the
vegetation there, and flooding from heavy rains the next year
leveled the camp's buildings.
   Floods in the area also killed 10 people, swept away bridges and
other buildings, and inflicted million of dollars in damages.
   Los Angeles County enacted an interim ordinance that barred
reconstruction of the Lutherglen buildings while officials looked
for a permanent solution to the flooding threat.
   The Supreme Court in 1987 used the case to rule that landowners
can be awarded compensation when government regulations bar them
from using their property.
   But the justices sent the church's case back to a California
appeals court to decide whether the church would receive any money.
   The state appeals court ruled in May 1969 that the church is not
entitled to be paid because it was not deprived of all use of its
property, even temporarily, and because whatever uses were denied
were justified by public safety concerns.
   The appeals court said Lutherglen still could be used for
various camping and recreational activities.
   Moreover, the state court said, the county was justified in
preventing rebuilding because of the threat to life and property
from another flood.
   ``What First English can no longer do is rebuild the bunkhouses
and similar permanent living structures which might house the
potential victims of a future flood,'' the state court said.
``These zoning restrictions represent a valid exercise of the
police power and not an unconstitutional taking (of property)
without compensation.''
   The church said the state court ruling amounts to ``willful
defiance'' of the Supreme Court's 1987 ruling.
   ``The California courts do not yet appear to have received the
message'' that they are depriving property owners of their rights,
the church said.
   The National Association of Realtors, the National Association
of Home Builders and the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation
supported the church's appeal.
   The California attorney general's office urged the justices to
leave the state court ruling intact.
   The case is First English Church vs. Los Angeles County, 89-826.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a
$350,000 award a Massachusetts hospital was ordered to pay the
family of a girl who lost sight in her right eye after surgery.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that reduced the
medical malpractice judgment to $20,000 under a state law that
protects charitable institutions.
   New England Medical Center in Boston was sued in 1983 by Joseph
and Elizabeth English. Their daughter, Kerrie Ann, underwent
cataract surgery at the hospital in 1980 at age 8. She developed an
infection after the operation.
   A jury awarded the family $350,000 against the hospital but
returned verdicts in favor of two doctors who treated the girl.
   A judge reduced the damages to $20,000 under a 1971
Massachusetts law that imposes that cap for personal injury
lawsuits against charities.
   The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld the reduced
damages last year.
   ``We are not without misgivings about the paltriness of the
$20,000 cap ... but we cannot correctly declare the statute to be
unconstitutional,'' the state court said. ``A change in the amount
of the cap may be appropriate. But that is a legislative decision.''
   Lawyers for the English family said the law violates
constitutional equal protection guarantees. Only victims of
injuries caused by charities are subject to the discriminatory cap,
they said.
   ``The statute must be seen as the product of a powerful lobby
securing unneeded protection from the legislature at the expense of
an unrepresented and powerless class of victims,'' the lawyers said.
   ``The statute fails to make a distinction between victims to
whom $20,000 would be a boon and those to whom it would barely be a
beginning,'' the appeal said.
   The case is English vs. New England Medical Center, 89-825.

<HEAD>Georgia Governor, Citing Cost, Calls For End to Racial
Demonstrations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris wants an end to the
racial demonstrations that have cost state taxpayers more than $1
million this month.
   ``Enough is enough,'' Barbara Morgan, the governor's news
secretary, said Sunday. ``The point has been made.''
   More than 2,500 police and National Guard troops lined the
streets near the tomb of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr. on Saturday as four white supremacists, led by Richard
Barrett of Mississippi, demonstrated on the national historic site
adjacent to the tomb and the King Center.
   About 75 counterdemonstrators jeered from a distance.
   Barrett then traveled to Forsyth County, where he and one
supporter marched. Civil rights leader Hosea Williams and about 60
supporters also marched in the county Saturday. The two events
passed without incident.
   Barrett said today that ``in an attempt to be reasonable,'' he
would consider heeding the governor's request if he could meet with
Harris.
   ``We would like to meet with Gov. Harris _ and President Bush,''
Barrett said, ``to discuss reforms that would help bring about more
democracy and greater majority rule. ... Something constructive
might come from it.''
   Ms. Morgan said today that the governor's office had not heard
from Barrett and would have no immediate response to his statements.
   Harry Heath, spokesman for the Georgia Department of Defense,
estimated it cost the department $500,000 for its weekend security
work in Atlanta, in addition to costs for National Park Service
personnel. A Ku Klux Klan rally at the state Capitol on Jan. 6,
which drew about 50 Klan members and supporters and 100
counterdemonstrators, also cost taxpayers $500,000.
   ``When people put in for a permit, we know how large the nucleus
is going to be, but we have no idea how large the
counterdemonstration will be because they don't have to have a
permit,'' Heath said. ``We have to prepare for the absolute worst.''
   Ms. Morgan said the security staff for such demonstrations
wouldn't be cut back as a rule. She said such determinations are
made by the state's security experts on a case-by-case basis.
   ``It's not just to provide protection for the demonstrators,''
she said. ``We have to consider the potential for violence outside
the demonstration as well.''
   Cumming Police Chief Wayne Lindsey estimated that security costs
to his city were $2,500. Forsyth County Sheriff Wesley Walraven
said county security costs may have ranged from $50,000 to $100,000.

<HEAD>U.N. Envoy Winds Up Talks on Higgins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. envoy left the country today after
talking with Lebanese militia officials about the fate of U.S.
Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, who was reported hanged by
kidnappers last year.
   Marrack Goulding, a U.N. assistant secretary-general, arrived in
Beirut on Thursday and conferred earlier with President Elias Hrawi
and Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
   He met today with Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the
spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem Hezbollah, or
Party of God, and with Nabih Berri, justice minister and leader of
the secular Shiite Amal militia.
   A source close to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
said Goulding's meeting with Fadlallah was to ``try to ascertain
Higgins' fate.''
   Higgins, who led a U.N. observer team in southern Lebanon, was
kidnapped near the port of Tyre on Feb. 17, 1988.
   The pro-Iranian group called the Organization of the Oppressed
on Earth said it killed him in July after Israel kidnapped a
Hezbollah sheik.
   U.S. intelligence officials believe Higgins actually was killed
a year earlier in retaliation for a U.S. warship accidentally
shooting down an Iranian civilian airliner over the Persian Gulf.
All 290 people on board the plane were killed.
   Hezbollah is an umbrella organization for several pro-Iranian
Shiite factions holding most of the 18 western hostages seized in
Lebanon since March 1985.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   The main goal of Goulding's Middle East tour is obtaining a
renewal of the U.N. observer force's mandate. The force of 5,800
troops drawn from nine nations has been deployed in southern
Lebanon since Israel invaded part of the region in 1978.
   Goulding was to travel to Syria after he left Lebanon today.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let New Mexico Officials Break Prison Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let New
Mexico officials break part of a 1980 pact they say put the state's
four prisons under ``day-to-day federal court control.''
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that upheld the
10-year-old court consent decree.
   The dispute dates back to a 1977 lawsuit by inmates of the
state's penitentiary, at the time New Mexico's only prison. The
suit challenged prison conditions and practices as unconstitutional.
   A partial settlement was agreed to in 1979. A broader agreement
between prison authorities and inmates was reached several months
after 33 inmates were killed a February 1980 riot at the
penitentiary.
   The 1980 court-approved pact, which covered all future prisons
and inmates as well, set standards for numerous aspects of prison
life.
   Some of the standards, such as those governing food services and
medical care, were not challenged by state officials.
   But others were attacked in a 1987 request seeking to modify the
1980 agreement.
   Specifically, state officials objected to these requirements:
   _Inmate security classifications must be made by a three-member
committee representing a prison's psychological, program and
security staffs with participation by the individual inmate.
   _Maximum security may be used only for inmates who have
committed or been linked to particular acts involving prison
security.
   The state's appeal said the requirement makes maximum security
``unavailable for known gang leaders who have not themselves
engaged in recent misconduct.''
   _Inmates may be punished only for certain designated offenses
and only for specified lengths of time, never exceeding 30 days.
   _All inmates except those in maximum security must receive
``eight hours a day of meaningful activity,'' to include vocational
training, education and work.
   _No prison may use ``double-celling,'' or putting more than one
inmate in any cell, except in the face of dire emergencies such as
riots or fires, regardless of the cell's size. Dormitories must
provide 60 square feet for each inmate.
   _Liberal visitation policies must be used, including allowing
kissing and embracing when feasible.
   U.S. District Judge Juan G. Burciaga in 1988 turned down the
state's request to modify the consent decree, and the 10th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his ruling last Sept. 15.
   In the appeal acted on today, New Mexico Attorney General Hal
Stratton argued, ``The issues in this case vitally affect the
ability of the states to administer their ... prisons free from
long-term, day-to-day federal court control over matters not
governed by federal law.''
   The state's appeal called the 1980 consent decree ``outmoded''
because more recent high court rulings make clear that the decree's
standards ``go far beyond any federal law requirements.''
   The appeal was supported in a ``friend-of-the-court'' brief
filed by 39 states and Puerto Rico.
   The case is Carruthers vs. Duran, 89-786.

<HEAD>Exports Rise, But Economic Sanctions Hurt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China's trade figures improved in 1989, but
economic sanctions imposed after the crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement severely limited access to foreign loans and technology, a
trade official said today.
   Liu Xiangdong, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Economic
Relations and Trade, said exports reached $43.27 billion, up 6.5
percent from 1988, while imports declined by 3.9 percent to $38.27
billion.
   But he said economic sanctions imposed by Western nations after
the military crushed the student-led pro-democracy movement in June
caused foreign loan agreements to drop by 51 percent, to $4.8
billion.
   He said the number of technology import contracts, 328, was down
25 percent due to tougher restrictions on technology transfers to
China following the crackdown. The value of those contracts dropped
18 percent to $2.9 billion.
   Liu noted that some developed countries recently indicated they
will lift sanctions. But he said no action had been taken and ``we
do not have any unrealistic fantasies.''
   China must stress self-reliance in its modernization drive, he
said.
   The nation's chief economic planning official echoed Liu's
sentiments in a speech to businessmen in Tokyo today.
   ``The population of China is large, and the issues the Chinese
people face are serious and tough,'' said Zou Jiahua, head of
China's State Planning Commission.
   ``We need a stable and united government, and a stable
environment, to carry through construction of socialism,'' he told
the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade.
   Zou, who arrived in Japan last week at the invitation of the
trade group, is the first high-level Chinese official to visit
since the crackdown.
   He said China's lifting of martial law in Beijing on Jan. 11 was
evidence of stability.
   The move was widely seen as a gesture aimed at bringing foreign
investors back to China and persuading Western governments to drop
sanctions imposed after the June crackdown.
   The United States reacted by dropping opposition to World Bank
loans for ``basic human needs,'' and Japan has indicated it will
renew talks on a credit package for development projects.
   Liu said China had not signed one foreign assistance contract
since last spring's political turmoil.
   He said imports were down because of the drop in technology
purchases and austerity policies that have sharply reduced demand
and economic growth.
   As a consequence, trade with Japan fell 5 percent to about $14
billion, Liu said. U.S.-Chinese trade was up 13.7 percent, to $9.4
billion, however.
   Liu said not one of the 899 Beijing-based foreign firms
registered with the trade ministry left after the military
crackdown, and that 71 more firms had registered since June.
   He said there were 5,784 new projects involving foreign
investment nationwide last year, down by 2.7 percent.

   The nation's fiercely competitive
long-distance carriers may reach a detente if AT&amp;T asks for a
mutual-aid pact to ease the effects of a network failure like last
week's massive shutdown.
   Already, the company has told its operators to give out the
access codes of its two rivals, MCI and US Sprint, and other
carriers in case of a similar problem.
   Harry Baumgartner, a spokesman for the American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., said the company is studying the idea of a backup
system involving all three companies, and a proposal could be ready
this week.
   ``We're still looking at the feasibility, and this may never
come to pass,'' said Baumgartner. ``The point is, what we are
interested in at AT&amp;T is that our customers don't experience
anything like this ever again. Whatever it takes to do that, we'll
do it.''
   US Sprint and MCI appeared to be receptive to the idea.
Spokesman for all three major carriers said that the prospect of a
mutual-aid agreement raises some technological questions but none
that can't be overcome. Legal experts said it also could be
challenged on anti-trust grounds.
   ``It's remarkable because they've been battling so bitterly,
with the industry so competitive,'' said Audrey Stevoff, an analyst
with Duff &amp; Phelpps Inc. in Chicago. ``It would definately be a
major change for the industry.''
   The system failure, which hampered long distance calling
nationwide for nine hours a week ago, was a blow that may go deeper
than merely bruising the prestige of the No. 1 carrier, analysts
said. But it will help AT&amp;T's competitors more than it will hurt
AT&amp;T, they predict.
   ``I think AT&amp;T has been very intelligent about how they're
handling this and is minimizing its effects,'' said Paul Aran, an
analyst with Bear Stearns in New York. ``They've taken this very,
very seriously so that it doesn't happen again, and they're working
to make it up to their customers.''
   AT&amp;T has proposed, pending Federal Communications Commission
approval, giving its 80 million customers nine hours of discount
service on Valentine's Day to compensate for the outage.
   Aran said No. 2 MCI Communications Corp. and No. 3 US Sprint
stand to gain, but the public relations windfall will be
short-lived.
   ``AT&amp;T has been seen as something like America's most invincible
company, but nothing, no company, is perfect,'' Aran said. ``OK,
now the shock wears off, people say, `So they're not perfect.'''
   He added that AT&amp;T's handling of the incident has shown that it
is a strong company with high standards, and that signing on with
its rivals in a backup agreement would be a bold move.
   US Sprint has pounced on the shutdown to try to increase its 8
percent of the market. The company immediately began running
full-page ads in major newspapers with instructions on how to use
Sprint ``the next time you experience difficulties dialing long
distance.'' But Sprint doesn't rule out cooperating with AT&amp;T,
either.
   ``We'd welcome anything in the industry that will give people
better service,'' said Sprint spokesman Sid Courson. ``If we can
help make sure everybody who wants to call long distance can, and
the logistics are there, we'd welcome talking to AT&amp;T.''
   The sentiments were echoed at MCI, which controls about 12
percent of the long-distance market.
   ``I think it would be nice to have plans like that in place,''
said MCI spokesman Dave Thompson. ``We are a service industry and
should do everything we can to see that that service is not
interrupted.''

<TEXT>
   A $49,625 rug installed in the Oval Office a
year and a half ago has been replaced by President Bush as part of
an overall redecoration program, the White House said today.
   The old rug, which took two years to design and make and was
paid for by an anonymous donor, was removed last Friday.
   It was replaced by an oval rug measuring 30 feet, 10 inches long
by 23 feet, 5 inches wide.
   Larry Hokanson, president of a Houston company that made the new
rug, said it cost $28,550, plus freight and installation charges.
   ``Normally, the designing process takes a couple months and the
normal manufacturing time is about 16 to 18 weeks, but because of
the prestige of this, we cut all that back to two weeks on
designing and 2{ months on production, Hokanson said.
   He said every stitch of the new rug was hand-guided. It was
unclear what would happen to the old rug, which was installed June
6, 1988.
   ``It was not terribly attractive. The president did not like
it,'' Hokanson said.
   The new rug has a gray-blue field that centers the coat-of-arms
from the presidential seal, delineated in shades of gold on an
ivory ground.
   When the old rug was installed, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, ``wanted to leave an
asset to the White House and they felt this would be an attractive
asset.''
   A White House statement said that in addition to the new rug,
the Oval Office had new draperies, a new coffee table and
reupholstered armchairs.
   The entire redecoration cost $62,470 and was paid for with funds
contributed by private donors, the statement said.

<HEAD>Newspapers, Leaders, Blast China's Restrictions on Hong Kong
Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers and local leaders today blasted a
decision by China to limit the number of lawmakers freely elected
by voters, and one editorial called it an ``inglorious'' victory
for Beijing.
   Politicians burned a copy of China's decision in front of the
headquarters of the Xinhua News Agency, Beijing's de facto embassy
to the British colony. In London, a senior member of Hong Kong's
legislative council, Alan Lee, arrived today to lobby the British
government to speed democratic reforms in the colony before it
reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
   Conservative business leaders took the unusual step of joining
with pro-democracy activists in criticizing the plan.
   ``Beijing has insisted on a political scheme that has been
publicly dismissed by virtually every organization and every
community leader in Hong Kong,'' said Martin C.M. Lee, a leading
voice for democratic change. At a news conference, Lee called on
Britain to continue its push for democracy in Hong Kong.
   The reaction indicated the lack of faith many in this territory
of 5.7 million have in Communist China. Beijing has promised to
maintain Hong Kong's free-wheeling capitalist system for 50 years
after it resumes control in 1997.
   Confidence in that promise has evaporated since the June 3-4
military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing. Further
blows have been struck as China's stance has become increasingly
hard-line due to upheavals in Eastern Europe.
   On Saturday, in the southern Chinese city of Canton, a
Chinese-appointed committee decided to limit to 18 the number of
directly elected seats in Hong Kong's 60-member legislature, rising
to 30 in 2003. The committee is writing the Basic Law, the
blueprint for Hong Kong's government after 1997.
   The committee also voted to divide the legislature into two
houses and further restrict who could hold high office in the
territory after Beijing resumes sovereignty.
   None of the six committee delegates from Hong Kong voted for
Beijing's plan, which passed because all 10 of China's delegates
supported it.
   Raymond Wu, the leader of the Hong Kong delegation, called
Beijing's move dictatorial and vowed to leave politics. Wu broke
down in tears during sessions in Canton because, he said, ``I
became sad when I thought about the future of Hong Kong.''
   Hong Kong politicians have called for at least 20 seats to be
directly elected in 1991 with substantial increases after that.
   About 1,000 Hong Kong residents leave the territory each week
and the number is expected to rise. Analysts fear that if the trend
continues Hong Kong's economy will suffer.
   Critics said China's decision to split Hong Kong's legislature
revealed Beijing's desire to control political developments in the
territory.
   Under the plan, laws will have to gain a majority of two groups
- those directly elected and those chosen by special interest
groups. The Daily Express said such a model would weaken the
legislature and benefit the executive branch, which Beijing is
expected to easily influence.

<HEAD>Court Rules Fair-Trial Rights Not Violated When Blacks Excluded
from Juries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled today in
the case of a convicted white rapist that fair-trial rights are not
violated when blacks are excluded from serving as jurors.
   But the 5-4 ruling in an Illinois case did not leave white
defendants powerless to challenge the exclusion of blacks from
their juries. The court left unanswered whether race-based
exclusions ever discriminate unlawfully against white defendants.
   The dissenters said the decision condones racial bias in jury
selection.
   The court in 1986 ruled that when prosecutors disqualify
potential jurors based on their race it violates the 14th
Amendment's ban on discrimination. The amendment guarantees equal
protection under the law.
   The 1986 case involved a black defendant and black jurors, and
was not based on the Sixth Amendment's guarantee to be tried by a
fair cross-section of the community.
   That ruling dramatically curtailed the traditionally broad power
of prosecutors to eliminate prospective jurors from trials by using
peremptory, or automatic, challenges.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court in today's case,
said, ``Race as such has nothing to do with the legal issue in this
case.''
   Scalia said the Constitution's Sixth Amendment right to be tried
by a jury representing a fair cross-section of the community was
not violated by excluding blacks from the trial of Daniel Holland,
a Chicago-area white man sentenced to 85 years in prison for rape,
kidnaping and armed robbery.
   Holland's ``Sixth Amendment claim would be just as strong if the
object of the exclusion had been, not blacks, but postmen, or
lawyers, or clergymen, or any number of other identifiable
groups,'' Scalia said.
   The Sixth Amendment ``no more forbids the prosecutor to strike
jurors on the basis of race than it forbids him to strike them on
the basis of innumerable other generalized characteristics,'' he
said.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a dissenting opinion, said, ``The
majority today insulates an especially invidious form of racial
discrimination in the selection of juries. The elimination of
racial discrimination in our system of criminal justice is not a
constitutional goal that should lightly be set aside.''
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and Harry A.
Blackmun.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a separate dissent, said, ``A jury
that is the product of such a racially discriminatory selection
process cannot possibly be an impartial jury within the meaning of
the Sixth Amendment.``
   Joining Scalia were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Byron R. White and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   In Holland's case, the only two blacks among the more than 30
prospective jurors were excluded by the prosecution from serving on
the all-white panel that convicted him.
   Prosecutors said they were not motivated by racial
considerations when they used their peremptory challenges to
exclude the two blacks, a man and a woman, from the jury.
   Holland was convicted of raping and kidnaping a Des Plaines,
Ill., teen-age girl on May 4, 1980.
   The Illinois Supreme Court ruled that because Holland is white
he lacked legal standing to raise the issue of whether race played
a part in the exclusion of the blacks.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled otherwise today. Scalia said a
white criminal defendant has as much legal standing as a black to
claim a Sixth Amendment violation in such a case.
   But Scalia said Holland's claim fails because eliminating a
distinctive group from a jury does not deprive the defendant of a
representative jury in violation of the Constitution.
   The court has never held that ``representativeness cannot be
diminished by allowing both the accused and the state to eliminate
persons thought to be inclined against their interests,'' Scalia
said.
   The case is Holland vs. Illinois, 88-5050.

<HEAD>Court Scuttles Suit Stemming from Collapse of Maryland S&amp;L</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today scuttled a federal
lawsuit stemming from the collapse of the Old Court Savings &amp; Loan
Association in Maryland, saying state courts may handle suits based
on a federal anti-racketeering law.
   The justices unanimously ruled that lower federal courts rightly
dismissed the suit because similar suits were being handled by
state courts in Maryland.
   Old Court's collapse helped trigger a savings and loan crisis in
Maryland in 1985, and led to criminal convictions for former owners
Jeffrey Levitt, Jerome Cardin and Allan Pearlstein.
   Levitt was sentenced to 30 years in prison for stealing $14.7
million from the thrift institution; Cardin 15 years for stealing
$385,000; and Pearlstein eight years for stealing $640,786.
   Civil suits seeking hundreds of millions of dollars were filed
against the owners in federal and state courts. Some of those
claims have been settled out of court.
   Old Court owners and others, including a law firm and an
accounting firm that worked for the savings and loan, were accused
in the suits of the largest financial fraud in Maryland's history.
   A group of 30 Maryland non-residents _ Old Court investors who
live in seven other states _ sued in federal court. They alleged,
among other things, that the defendants violated the federal
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
   The law, although primarily aimed at fighting organized crime,
has been used increasingly in lawsuits against businesses.
   The investors' federal suit was dismissed by a federal judge
because other suits alleging RICO violations were then pending in
Maryland state courts.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, and
today's decision said the appeals court was right. The ruling
resolves conflicting rulings on the issue among the nation's
federal appeals courts.
   ``We hold that state courts have concurrent jurisdiction to
consider civil claims arising under RICO,'' Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor wrote for the court.
   ``Nothing in the language, structure, legislative history or
underlying policies of RICO suggests that Congress intended
otherwise,'' she said.
   The case is Tafflin vs. Levitt, 88-1650.

   Israeli troops killed two Arab guerrillas today
after a firefight in southern Lebanon left an Israeli army colonel
dead, the army said.
   In the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, the radical Abu Nidal
Palestinian group today claimed responsibility for the border
attack Sunday, in which the colonel and an Arab guerrilla were
killed.
   After Sunday's exchange, troops backed by tanks launched an
overnight search for two other guerrillas who the soldiers believed
had fled the house, the army said.
   ``A chase has been going on since the early morning hours, and
in the end they were discovered and in a short battle they were
eliminated,'' said Israel's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron,
on Israel army radio. He gave no further details of today's action.
   The army initially said three guerrillas were killed today, but
it later said a search of the area found only two bodies.
   The exchange of fire began Sunday after the guerrillas
barricaded themselves in an isolated house just north of the
Israeli-Lebanese border.
   From the building, they ambushed a group of Israeli-backed
Lebanese militiamen of the South Lebanon Army. The unit was led by
Israeli Col. Yitzhak Rahimov, who was fatally wounded.
   Troops stormed the three-story house, where they found the body
of one guerrilla, Shomron said. He said it was not certain whether
the guerrilla was killed by Israeli troops or by cover fire from
his squad members.
   Rahimov was the highest-ranking Israeli officer to be killed in
southern Lebanon since the army withdraw the bulk of its troops in
June 1985, ending a three-year occupation.
   Sunday's gunbattle occurred north of the Lebanese village of
Yaroun, about one mile north of Israel's border.
   Rahimov had led a unit of the South Lebanon Army to Yaroun on
Sunday after a villager reported seeing three guerrillas, Israel
radio said. The guerrillas were reportedly armed with
rocket-propelled grenade launchers and Soviet-designed Kalashnikov
assault rifles.
   As the militiamen surrounded the house, the guerrillas opened
fire and hurled grenades at them. South Lebanon Army fighters
called in tanks, and the 39-year-old Rahimov was hit in the head by
automatic gunfire as he approached one of the tanks, the radio said.
   Militia tanks opened fire, heavily damaging the house, the
report added.
   In Sidon, a spokesman for Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the group
led by terrorist Abu Nidal, told reporters his group had mounted
the attack. However, he refused to provide other details.
   A separate statement by the group said the guerrilla squad was
retaliating for Israeli air raids Friday on Palestinian bases and
positions of the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem Hezbollah, or Party of
God. Seven people were killed and 18 wounded in those attacks.
   The weekend clashes on the ground occurred in Israel's
self-declared security zone, a strip up to 10 miles deep in
southern Lebanon. It is designed as a buffer against attacks by
Palestinian and Shiite Moslem guerrillas.
   The security zone is patrolled jointly by Israeli troops and
about 3,000 militiamen from the predominantly Christian South
Lebanon Army.

   Authorities today released a leading
Palestinian activist after he was arrested last week on suspicion
of financing Palestinian militants.
   The pro-PLO activist, Faisal Husseini, has been mentioned as a
likely negotiator in proposed Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, threatened to resign
if he loses a vote of confidence in his Middle East peace plan when
his right-wing Likud bloc convenes next month to consider motions
by hard-liners that the plan be dropped.
   ``It is very clear that if the (party) Central Committee doesn't
support me I cannot stand at the head of Likud and not at the head
of the country,'' Shamir said in an interview on Israel army radio.
   Also today, Attorney General Yosef Harish ordered police to
investigate suspicions that Science Minister Ezer Weizman of the
left-of-center Labor Party held illegal contacts with Palestine
Liberation Organization figures, Israel radio reported.
   Husseini, unshaven and wearing a leather coat after leaving a
police lockup, told reporters, ``Nothing will stop the peace
process.'' He was released without bail while the investigation
against him continues.
   About a dozen supporters of the anti-Arab Kach movement tried to
attack Husseini as he left the jail. His supporters blocked them,
and the two groups exchanged blows with fists and clubs.
   Women from the organization ``Victims of Arab Terror'' also
scuffled nearby with Palestinian women.
   No one was reported injured in the melees, and Husseini managed
to push his way into a waiting car.
   His arrest Friday brought international criticism. U.S. State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in Washington that
``such actions discourage Palestinian confidence in the peace
process and contribute to the prevailing atmosphere of distrust.''
   Israeli leaders have rejected charges by Israeli liberals and
Palestinians that Husseini was arrested to placate right-wing
pressure groups.
   Authorities have said Husseini belonged to a ``hostile
organization'' and paid $450 to Palestinian activists to buy
uniforms.
   In a detention hearing Friday, a district court judge ordered
Husseini held for four days for questioning.
   Before his release today, Husseini appeared before a police
investigator who said the inquiry against him would continue, but
that there was no need to extend his detention.
   Israel radio said Husseini was questioned during the weekend by
Israel's domestic security service and that several Palestinians
were arrested as a result. The report did not elaborate.
   Husseini, 49, has been involved in behind-the-scenes diplomatic
efforts to arrange Israeli-Palestinian talks in Egypt on Israel's
proposal for elections in the occupied lands.
   Husseini, who speaks fluent Hebrew, frequently addresses Israeli
audiences, calling for a Palestinian state alongside Israel and
denouncing violence on both sides.
   Husseini spent 18 months in prison at the start of the
2-year-old Palestinian uprising without being charged.
   The reports of an inquiry of Weizman comes three weeks after
allegations that he had PLO contacts nearly broke up Israel's
coalition government. Shamir forced him to resign from the
decision-making Inner Cabinet because of the accusations.
   Justice Ministry officials could not immediately be reached for
comment.
   Despite an investigation, Weizman would be immune from
prosecution unless Parliament lifted his immunity as a legislator
by a majority vote. Israeli law bars contacts with the PLO as a
terrorist organization, allowing a maximum punishment of three
years in jail.

<HEAD>Court to Review Former Wrestling Coach's Suit Against Ohio
Newspaper</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 3rd graf, The Willoughby-based, to show Diadiun now
with Cleveland Plain Dealer.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to review a
former high school wrestling coach's 15-year-old libel lawsuit
against an Ohio newspaper, a case that reached the high court twice
previously.
   The justices said they will review an Ohio Supreme Court ruling
that threw out Michael Milkovich's 1975 suit against the News
Herald of Lake County.
   The Willoughby-based newspaper is published by the Lorain
Journal Co. It and onetime sports writer Ted Diadiun, now an editor
with The Plain Dealer in Cleveland, were sued over a 1975 column
that accused Milkovich and a former school administrator of lying
during a court hearing.
   Milkovich was coaching Maple Heights High School's wrestling
team at a 1974 home meet against Mentor High School when a melee
involving both teams and spectators erupted. Several wrestlers were
hospitalized.
   Diadiun, who was at the meet, wrote several articles criticizing
Milkovich's conduct.
   In a Jan. 8, 1975, column, Diadiun accused the coach and H. Don
Scott, then superintendent of Maple Heights public schools, of
lying to a judge who had overturned disciplinary measures against
the Maple Heights team.
   During extensive litigation, Milkovich won two preliminary
rounds before the Ohio Supreme Court, and both victories were left
intact by the nation's highest court.
   In a 1984 decision, the Ohio court ruled that Diadiun's
statements about Milkovich were reported as facts, not opinion.
   Expressions of opinion generally are immune from libel lawsuits.
   But in ruling on Scott's related libel suit two years later, the
Ohio Supreme Court reversed its 1984 ruling _ and said Diadiun's
statements were expressions of his opinion.
   In an unusual move, the Ohio court used its Aug. 6, 1986,
decision in Scott's case to doom as well Milkovich's suit against
the paper and Diadiun.
   The state court, voting 4-3 and applying a ``totality of the
circumstances'' test, said the sued-over column is immune, under
the Constitution's free-speech guarantees, from liability.
   One factor discussed by the Ohio court was the column's
placement on the paper's sports page _ what the court called ``a
traditional haven for cajoling, invective and hyperbole.''
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Milkovich urged the
justices to use his case to clarify how courts should determine
whether allegedly libelous statements are to be viewed as ``fact''
or ``opinion.''
   But lawyers for the newspaper and Diadiun said the appeal should
be rejected because the Ohio court had based its decision not only
on the federal Constitution but on the Ohio Constitution as well.
   A state's highest court, not the U.S. Supreme Court, is the
ultimate interpreter of that state's constitution.
   The case is Milkovich vs. Lorain Journal Co., 89-645.

<HEAD>Court Signals It Willing to Allow Random Drug Testing of Some
Government

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, giving another signal that
it is willing to allow random drug testing of government employees
in sensitive positions, today rejected appeals by Justice
Department employees and civilian Army counselors.
   The justices, in their first drug-testing rulings, last March
upheld drug and alcohol tests for railway workers involved in
accidents and for U.S. Customs Service employees applying for jobs
in drug enforcement or jobs that require carrying a gun.
   Neither of those rulings, however, determined the
constitutionality of randomly administered drug tests.
   Today the court, without comment, rejected appeals by Justice
Department employees with top security clearance and civilian Army
drug and alcohol counselors who said mandatory random tests violate
their privacy rights.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Ruled in the case of a convicted white rapist that fair-trial
rights are not violated when blacks are excluded from serving as
jurors.
   But the 5-4 ruling in an Illinois case did not leave white
defendants powerless to challenge the exclusion of blacks from
their juries. The court left unanswered whether such race-based
exclusions ever discriminate unlawfully against white defendants.
   The dissenters said the decision condones racial bias in jury
selection.
   _ Agreed to decide whether nuclear industry ``whistleblowers''
who say they were disciplined for complaining about lax safety may
sue under state personal-injury laws.
   The justices said they will review a North Carolina case in
which a federal appeals court said such workers must sue under a
special federal law.
   _ Agreed to use a decade-long dispute over the rights of Haitian
refugees to decide when the government must pay legal fees to
people who sue it successfully.
   The court said it will hear a Bush administration appeal aimed
at limiting such fees.
   _ Refused to require arbitration for hundreds of thousands of
federal workers when they are fired, demoted or otherwise
disciplined.
   The court, without comment, rejected appeals by a labor union
and the Federal Labor Relations Authority seeking broader job
protection for federal employees.
   In one of the drug-testing cases acted on today, the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld random urinalysis for several
hundred civilian drug counselors in the Army.
   The appeals court said requiring them to submit to the tests is
reasonable because counselors who use illicit drugs are bound to be
``unsympathetic to their mission'' of helping others overcome drug
addiction.
   ``The Army maintains a legitimate interest in ensuring that its
employees are allegiant to their essential mission,'' the appeals
court said.
   Random testing for thousands of other civilian Army workers who
fly and service planes and helicopters and hold law enforcement
jobs was upheld by the appeals court also. Those employees did not
appeal.
   The drug counselors' appeal was made by their union, the
National Federation of Federal Employees.
   In the case involving top-ranked Justice Department employees,
the appeals court said the government's interest in protecting
top-security information outweighs individual privacy interests.
   But the appeals court barred the government from imposing random
tests for other department employees, such as federal prosecutors
and workers with access to grand jury information.
   Bush administration lawyers did not ask the Supreme Court to
permit more widespread drug testing by overturning that portion of
the appeals court ruling.
   But administration lawyers urged the court not to disturb the
rulings that permit testing of the Army drug counselors and Justice
Department employees with top security clearance.
   The counselors ``occupy a critical place in the Army's
comprehensive drug program,'' the government lawyers said.
   As for Justice Department employees with top security clearance,
the government said it is reasonable to require those ``entrusted
with the government's most closely held secrets'' to be drug free.
   The testing of federal employees stems from a 1986 order issued
by then-President Ronald Reagan calling for a drug-free federal
workplace.
   The Supreme Court's 1989 drug-testing rulings and the cases
acted on today do not bear directly on workers in private
employment.
   Congress is reviewing proposed legislation that would set
federal standards for testing by private businesses. A number of
states already have drug-testing laws. Some of them give more
privacy protection to workers than the federal proposal.
   Army counselors and Justice Department employees whose tests
show they have used drugs are subject to disciplinary action or
even firing, but do not face criminal prosecution as a result of
the tests.
   The cases are National Federation of Federal Employees vs.
Cheney, 89-635, and Bell vs. Thornburgh, 89-679.

   World chess champion Garri Kasparov today
criticized the Soviet military crackdown in his hometown of Baku,
saying it came too late to help his fellow Armenians in the
embattled republic of Azerbaijan.
   Kasparov, a Jewish-Armenian, said he rescued 60 of his friends
and relatives from the violence Wednesday night and that he had
lost two relatives in the ethnic fighting between Azerbaijanis and
Armenians.
   He said he used his money to charter a plane _ virtually
impossible in the Soviet Union _ with the help of the Chess Union,
and managed to get the people past vigilante squads to the airport
on a back road.
   Kasparov said there were plenty of Soviet Interior Ministry
troops and police in Baku before soldiers stormed the capital of
Azerbaijan on Saturday to put down a nationalist uprising.
   Yet they took no armed action against Azerbaijanis who roved the
city in bands and killed Armenians in a campaign of terror against
the minority population, Kasparov claimed at a news conference.
   Kasparov said Azerbaijanis angry with Soviet troops could turn
on the 100,000 Russians of Baku, expanding the ethnic conflict
beyond the Caucasus.
   ``I fear that what is now happening in Azerbaijan may lead to a
terrible bloodbath in the whole country,'' he said.
   The mainly Moslem republic Azerbaijan and the neighboring
republic of Armenia, which is predominately Christian, are locked
in a decades-old dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of
Azerbaijan that is populated mainly by Armenians.
   At least 167 people have been killed since the violence began 10
days ago, including 83 since Soviet troops entered the city
Saturday morning and were met by firebombs and machine-gun fire.
Azerbaijani estimates of the death toll are far higher.
   Kasparov said Moscow either was unwilling or unable to solve
ethnic disputes involving Azerbaijan and Armenia, and he called for
individuals to begin direct negotiations between the republics. He
volunteered to act as a mediator himself.
   Officials have evacuated the Armenians, and Kasparov contended
virtually all had left by the time Soviet troops assaulted on
Saturday.
   Therefore, he said, he believed the military action was intended
to crush the Azerbaijani independence movement, not stop the
killing, as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said.
   Kasparov blamed much of the violence on the desperation of
homeless Azerbaijanis, many of whom seized Armenians' apartments.
   ``You do not have to be a politician or a particularly
farsighted person to see the political danger that lies in homeless
people who have nothing to look forward to,'' he said.

<HEAD>Zhivkov Could Face 30 Years in Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted leader Todor Zhivkov, who was
arrested last week, faces up to 30 years in jail if convicted of
misuse of state property, a newspaper reported today.
   Zhivkov also faces charges of inciting ethnic hostility and
abusing his power during his nearly 35-year rule.
   Also today, a 12-party opposition coalition today resumed its
discussion with the Communist leadership on reforms. The talks were
suspended for several days last week after the Communists rejected
an opposition demand for access to state television and radio.
   According to the Panorama weekend television program, Zhivkov
was at his Boyana residence south of Sofia until Friday, when he
was taken into custody.
   The report quoted the Interior Ministry as saying that Zhivkov
was being held ``in a place specially adjusted for the purpose'' of
investigative custody. There was no elaboration.
   According to the newspaper Pogled, Zhivkov could serve from 10
years to 30 years in jail if convicted of illegally ``receiving an
especially large amount of public property.'' He has been accused
of having about 30 hunting or holiday retreats.
   Another charge against him, ``inciting ethnic hostility and
hatred,'' carries a maximum of three years, it said. The third
charge, abuse of power, is punishable by imprisonment of between
three and 10 years, it said.
   Zhivkov was replaced Nov. 10 by his former foreign minister,
Petar Mladenov, who promised free elections and struck down
guarantees of Communist Party supremacy in society.
   However, the pro-democracy opposition and some members within
the party contend party leaders are not moving fast enough.
   Koprinka Chervenkova, the spokeswoman for a reform-minded
faction within the ruling Communist Party, said if the party
ignores the various ideological trends, platforms and associations
inside it, the Alternative Socialist Society will leave the party.

   Roman Catholics reacted with sorrow, shock and at
least one protest to the proposed closing of about 30 churches and
10 religious-run schools in the nation's second largest archdiocese.
   ``I feel like I'm losing my faith,'' said Ray Rean, who said he
was born and baptized 69 years ago in St. Cyril and St. Methodius
parish, which is scheduled to be closed.
   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin announced the closings and mergers
Sunday to ease a budget defict that has forced the archdiocese to
borrow from commercial banks for the first time in its 110-year
history. The financial rescue plan also includes asking for greater
donations and higher school fees.
   Though some schools and congregations knew in advance, some
parish priests broke the news in announcements at services Saturday
night and Sunday morning.
   ``For some people this is their whole life,'' Anna De Santo said
after learning that her church, St. John Nepomucene, may be among
those that are shuttered. ``My grandson was christened here, my
children educated here, my father buried from here. I'm very sad.''
   Parishioner Howard Holubetz said he was shocked to learn St.
Dionysius Church in suburban Cicero would close.
   ``We were pretty well told if we could keep our nose above
water, and we have, that it would not close,'' he said.
   Bernardin said shifts in demographics have left some churches
and schools with too few people to meet costs. Officials say 27
percent of churches in the archdiocese sit less than half a mile
from a neighboring one, reflecting the practice in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries of providing ethnic-oriented parishes to
serve various immigrant groups.
   The archdiocese has experienced several years of deficit
spending, much of it to prop up individual parishes. It has
borrowed $15 million since July 1988, and officials think they'll
need to borrow at least $5 million more before the end of June.
   Without measures to stem the red ink, archdiocese debt could
balloon to $142 million in 1993, officials have said.
   In the past five years, 27 parishes and 20 elementary schools
have closed or consolidated, while five new or consolidated
parishes and six new or consolidated schools have been created.
   Declines in numbers of priests and nuns forced the church to
hire lay employees at higher costs. Insurance costs have risen, as
has the cost of maintaining church buildings, Bernardin said.
   Officials said Sunday that the precise number of closings is not
yet known, but they estimated the number at about 30 churches and
six to 11 schools in the city and several suburbs.
   The majority are to close by the end of June and the rest by the
end of June 1991.
   About 200 people demonstrated at the cardinal's residence later
in the day to protest the announcement last week that the
604-student Quigley South prep seminary will be closed at the end
of the school year.
   The closings and a planned 10 percent cut in administrative
costs will save more than $13 million, officials said in a news
release.
   The Chicago Archdiocese has 416 parishes in Cook and Lake
Counties, an area where 2.35 million of the 5.7 million population
is Catholic.
   It has the largest number of parishes and Catholic institutions
in the nation and is second in parishioners to Los Angeles,
according to officials. It runs the largest Catholic school system
in the country, with 343 elementary schools, 52 secondary schools,
eight colleges or universities, and five seminaries.
   In Detroit last year, Cardinal Edmund Szoka ordered 30 city
parishes to either close or merge, citing a shortage of priests,
declining membership and the increasing costs of maintaining church
facilities.
   Today, Szoka was named by Pope John Paul II to a top financial
post at the Vatican. He will head the Prefecture for Economic
Affairs of the Holy See, which draws up the Vatican's budget.
   At a news conference called to discuss his appointment, he
reacted to the Chicago announcement, saying other American cities
that no longer have the flood of immigrants they did decades ago
may face the same cutbacks.
   ``As painful as it is, we must face the reality,'' Szoka said.
``We simply can't hang onto the past. We have to change. We did
that in Detroit.
   ``I was the first to do so on such a grand scale. Chicago now
faces a similar situation. Other cities, like Philadelphia, New
York and Cleveland and cities of that type, will face the same
problem, and possibly the same solution.''

   The U.S. government's acceptance of a plea bargain
by subsidiaries of the world's seventh-largest private bank for
laundering millions in drug money is being called a joke by some
critics.
   But other observers say the deal with the Bank of Commerce and
Credit International may be justified if it helps win a conviction
against deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.
   ``It seems like a light hit, but it depends on what the
government is going to get out of them. It could be they are
sitting on a wealth of information,'' said Robert Powis, a former
U.S. treasury official.
   The divisions of the Luxembourg-based bank pleaded guilty
Tuesday to about 30 charges, including tax fraud, money laundering
and failing to report currency transactions of more than $10,000.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said he was seeking an
explanation about the arrangement from the Justice Department and
may initiate a congressional investigation.
   ``I don't believe that the entire criminal justice system in
America, nor all of our efforts to eliminate drugs in America,
revolves just around Noriega,'' Metzenbaum said.
   At the Justice Department today, spokesman David Runkel defended
the plea agreement, saying it guarantees the banks' cooperation in
continuing investigations of international money laundering.
   Runkel also noted it resulted in ``the largest forfeiture ever
in a case like this from a financial institution.''
   ``We're satisfied this is a good deal,'' Runkel said, adding
that the agreement contains further penalties if the banks fail to
fulfill their obligations to the U.S. government.
   The subsidiaries of BCCI, which has assets of about $20 billion,
admitted in Tampa federal court to laundering $14 million in drug
profits for traffickers tied to Noriega.
   Originally charged with laundering $32 million in cocaine
profits, the bank agreed to forfeit only the $14 million that the
U.S. government was able to freeze during its ``Operation C-Chase''
investigation that began in 1986.
   Fines, which could have reached $45 million, were suspended. The
bank also was placed on five years of government-supervised
probation, and promised to cooperate with prosecutors in what's
left of the money-laundering trial.
   The top remaining defendant is Amjad Awan, a bank officer who
told a U.S. Senate panel in 1988 he had acted as Noriega's personal
banker, managing up to $23 million in the dictator's secret
accounts at the bank's Panama branch. Jury selection resumed this
morning at the trial.
   U.S. District Judge W. Terrell Hodges has imposed a gag order to
prevent parties in the case from commenting.
   The Bush administration has backed new initiatives against money
laundering during the past year amid mounting evidence that
interdiction efforts have failed to keep drugs from flooding the
nation's borders.
   The bank's forfeiture is the largest in a money-laundering case
against a financial institution in the United States.
   Mark Schnapp, a former assistant U.S. attorney who advises banks
on how to prevent criminals from gaining access to their accounts,
said financial penalties against BCCI are less significant than the
fact that an entire bank has pleaded guilty to money laundering.
   ``I think it's a substantial price to pay,'' said Schnapp. ``No
bank or banker would want to step up to the podium and say they're
guilty. That smell sticks with them a long time.''
   But Florida's comptroller, Gerald Lewis, said: ``We've declared
unconditional war on drug traffickers. That's been the rhetoric in
Washington and elsewhere. ... Was it all just a joke?''
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who chairs the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee on narcotics, said the penalty was too
lenient.
   ``I think it's a very, very light sentence, it's that simple,''
Kerry said. ``I think it undercuts the war on drugs.''

<HEAD>Court Says D.C. Lawyers' `Strike' Against City Was Illegal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that lawyers in
the nation's capital violated antitrust law when they went ``on
strike'' to demand higher pay from the city for representing poor
criminal defendants.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court said the boycott was ``a plain
violation of antitrust laws.''
   The case now goes back to a lower court to consider reinstating
an order by the Federal Trade Commission that prohibits the lawyers
from engaging in similar conduct in the future.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, rejected
arguments that the attorneys' boycott is protected by the
Constitution.
   ``The undenied objective of their boycott was an economic
advantage for those who agreed to participate ... no matter how
altruistic the motives may have been,'' he said.
   Stevens said the case is different from a boycott by blacks in
Mississippi who refused to buy from white merchants. The court in
1982 ruled that the First Amendement protected those boycotters
against antitrust damages.
   In a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall,
Justice William J. Brennan said today's ruling goes too far in
limiting free-expression rights.
   Brennan said the lawyers may have violated antitrust law. But he
said the FTC must first prove the attorneys exerted ``market
power'' _ that they were capable of exercising economic control
through concerted action to determine how much the city paid them.
   Justice Harry Blackmun also dissented.
   The lawyers are members of the Superior Court Trial Lawyers
Association. The group organized a boycott in 1983 to pressure the
District of Columbia government to increase the hourly compensation
paid to attorneys who represent indigent criminal defendants.
   The attorneys, some 100 lawyers who represent most of the city's
poor criminal defendants, had been receiving $30 an hour for time
in court and $20 an hour for out-of-court work. They won a $25 per
hour increase after a two-week boycott in which nearly all of them
refused to accept new cases.
   The boycott created a crisis for the city, swamping the city
public defender's office with criminal cases. The city government
agreed to the higher hourly rate at an annual cost to taxpayers of
more than $4 million.
   The private lawyers who boycotted represent 85 percent of the
poor defendants. The remaining defendants are represented by the
public defender service, third-year law students or, in a small
number of cases, lawyers volunteering to work free.
   The FTC ruled after the so-called strike that the lawyers had
engaged in price fixing and an illegal boycott and ordered them not
to engage in similar conduct again.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here set aside the FTC
decision and ordered the agency to conduct further study to
determine whether the lawyers exerted market power.
   The case is FTC vs. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Association,
88-1198.

   A section of a Tokyo street erupted Monday, spewing
water, stones and mud before collapsing into a hole 17 feet deep,
authorities said. Ten people were injured, including three who were
jostled by hundreds of spectators trying to get a closer look.
   The 3:05 p.m. incident in the Ueno district was believed to have
been caused by a pressurized tunnel beneath the street, and it
opened up a hole about 42 feet long and 32 feet wide, said
Kenichiro Sumi of the Metropolitan Fire Board. No one fell into the
hole.
   Most of the injured were hurt by stones and other debris sent
flying by the erupting street, which is beneath the tracks of two
major commuter lines near a Japan Railways station. A 18-year-old
suffered a head injury when the front wheels of the station wagon
he was driving slipped over the edge of the hole, police said.
   All trains on the tracks overhead were stopped for about an hour
while the rails were inspected, Japan Railways officials said.
   A pressurized tunnel was suspected of causing the eruption,
police said, but added they still were investigating. The tunnel,
still under construction, reportedly had been pressurized to
prevent a cave-in.
   The spectacular eruption, which spattered nearby buildings with
mud and debris up to the third story, attracted a huge crowd,
estimated by Kyodo News Service at 5,000, within minutes.
   Kenichiro Sumi of Tokyo's Metropolitan Fire Board said three of
the injuries occurred as spectators jostled for a better view.

   Declaring India will make no deals ``over
human corpses,'' Prime Minister V.P. Singh rejected a $470 million
settlement with Union Carbide in the Bhopal gas disaster and vowed
to pursue $3 billion instead.
   The new prime minister also said Sunday that his government
would press criminal charges in the case.
   The 1984 gas leak, the world's deadliest industrial disaster,
killed more than 3,500 people. The $470 million settlement was
accepted last year by the Indian Supreme Court and by Singh's
predecessor, Rajiv Gandhi.
   Singh was greeted Sunday by surging crowds when he arrived at
the Jaiprakash Nagar shantytown, where many of the victims had
lived.
   Some people draped garlands of flowers around Singh's neck or
knelt to touch his feet as he walked through the narrow lanes of
huts just across the street from the now-closed Union Carbide plant.
   At a public rally attended by an estimated 100,000 people,
one-tenth of Bhopal's population, Singh declared: ``We have decided
to do away with the settlement and pursue the $3 billion suit
against the company and also the criminal suit against UCC (Union
Carbide Corp.) officials.''
   He promised that his government would provide interim relief to
all people living in affected areas. The amount of money to be paid
will be determined within one month, he said.
   The prime minister, who took office Dec. 2, did not spell out
how his government would revive the legal case.
   Union Carbide said today from its headquarters in Danbury,
Conn., that it would have no comment beyond a statement made last
week by Joseph E. Geoghan, the company's vice president and general
counsel.
   ``The settlement was extremely fair and is a binding agreement
of the union of India,'' Geoghan said at the time.
   India's Supreme Court on Feb. 15 accepted the $470 million deal
as ``full and final settlement'' of the government's suit, which
had been dragging through a maze of Indian court procedures for
about four years.
   The Gandhi government originally sought $3 billion in damages
and later filed criminal negligence charges against top officials
of Union Carbide and dissolved its local subsidiary.
   When Union Carbide and the Gandhi government agreed on the $470
million, the Supreme Court absolved the company of further civil or
criminal liability.
   However, under Indian law, the decision is subject to review if
challenged.
   Gas victims and activist groups filed petitions with the court
challenging the settlement on two grounds: that the Gandhi
government had no right to declare itself the sole representative
of all claims arising from the Bhopal gas disaster; and that the
compensation of $470 million was inadequate.
   The Supreme Court declared Dec. 22 that the Gandhi government
did, indeed, have the right to be the claimants' only
representative.
   The second challenge is still pending, and the Singh government
announced Jan. 12 it would support the challengers.
   Union Carbide has maintained the gas leak was the result of
sabotage by a disgruntled employee at the Bhopal plant. The
government maintained the disaster was caused by company negligence.
   Methyl isocyanate, a liquid used in making pesticides, leaked
from a tank and turned into a deadly vapor when it hit the air Dec.
3, 1984, while most people were asleep.
   According to figures compiled by the government of Madhya
Pradesh state, which includes Bhopal, the death toll has reached
3,598. About half the victims died immediately or within a few days
of exposure to the gas. The others died later of respiratory and
other problems caused by the gas, according to government records.

   President Bush assured anti-abortion marchers
today of his ``deep conviction'' against the Supreme Court ruling
17 years ago today that legalized abortion and his steadfast
opposition to abortion on demand.
   Bush, speaking by telephone to marchers gathered outside the
White House before their annual march past the Capitol and the
Supreme Court, said the anti-abortion movement reminds Americans
``of the self-evident moral superiority of adoption over abortion.''
   Bush also addressed the March for Life last year on his third
day as president, continuing the tradition of his predecessor,
Ronald Reagan.
   Even as he spoke, pro-choice forces led by the Planned
Parenthood Federation were urging Americans to call the White House
switchboard to register their support for legal abortions.
   Bush, in remarks that lasted just 90 seconds, said, ``Before you
begin the march, I want to take a minute to share my deep personal
concern about abortion on demand, which I oppose.
   ``For 17 years the March for Life has served as a poignant
reminder to all Americans that human life in all its forms must be
respected. And I think all of you know my deep conviction on Roe
vs. Wade,'' he added.
   The protest movement ``also reminds Americans, especially young
Americans, of the self-evident moral superiority of adoption over
abortion. We should all be grateful to the families that adopt
babies, giving them care and love and a chance for a wonderful
life,'' said Bush, two of whose 12 grandchildren are adopted.
   After hearing Bush and a handful of congressmen and other
speakers, the crowd planned to march up Pennsylvania Avenue to the
U.S. Capitol and the Supreme Court.
   Leaders of the National Right to Life Committee praised the
president and said they had no differences with Republican National
Chairman Lee Atwater's statements that the party can support
candidates on both sides of the abortion debate.
   ``We don't believe he's signaled any change in the Republican
Party's position,'' said David O'Steen, executive director of the
anti-abortion group. ``Of course the Republican Party contains and
is big enough to contain people with both points of view, as is the
Democratic Party.''
   Earlier, backers of legal abortion raised the specter of
Romania's former communist repression in warning against a rollback
of abortion rights.
   The head of the National Abortion Rights Action League told a
gathering on Capitol Hill that legalizing abortions was one of the
first steps Romania took after overthrowing its hated dictator last
month.
   ``Romanians know firsthand what most Americans can only imagine
_ the deadly impact of government bans on abortion,'' said Kate
Michelman, executive director of the abortion-rights lobbying group.
   ``It would be a travesty if the United States, the beacon of
democracy in the world, applauded Romania's reforms while adopting
repressive anti-choice laws here at home,'' she said.
   Activists on both sides of the issue _ sensing 1990 will be a
pivotal year in the political debate on abortion _ held competing
events marking the anniversary of the high court decision that
legalized abortions.
   Abortion foes expected tens of thousands of marchers in
Washington, and more at smaller events around the country.
   Abortion-rights advocates also gathered on the Mall outside the
Capitol where a temporary memorial was erected in tribute to all
women who have died from illegal, botched abortions _ including
Becky Bell, a 17-year-old Indianapolis girl who died in September
1988 after a self-induced abortion.
   Bill Bell, her father, said his daughter died because Indiana
law requires minors to obtain parental consent before they can get
a legal abortion.
   ``Our daughter was punished,'' he said. ``She was denied a
reasonable and safe choice because she loved her parents and died
not wanting to disappoint them. ... How many more young women will
share Becky's fate if we allow our government to deny them a safe
choice?''
   Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, a leading Republican supporter of
abortion rights, said his party is being damaged by the strongly
anti-abortion platform and position of Bush, who vetoed
abortion-rights bills passed by Congress last fall.
   He predicted the anti-abortion plank in the Republican Party
platform will be removed in 1992.
   Activists on both sides of the abortion issue rallied Sunday in
cities across the country, from Albany, N.Y., to Sacramento, Calif.
   Leaders of the anti-abortion movement planned to meet with
Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, and other administration
officials, but there were no plans for the president to see them,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday. Sununu is a
strong opponent of abortion.
   Others planning to speak to the anti-abortion rally included
Republican Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Gordon Humphrey
of New Hampshire.
   Abortion opponents have held their ``March for Life'' every year
since the court's decision.
   But this year's events had a new significance: it was the first
since the high court's Webster decision in July 1989, which opened
the door for states to impose some restrictions on abortion.
   ``Most of the time this is a sad occasion,'' said Nancy Myers,
spokeswoman for the National Right to Life Committee. ``But there's
a sense of hope this year because for the first time since 1973 the
Supreme Court has said it will allow some reasonable limits on
abortion.''
   The march came as political debate on abortion has intensified.
   Abortion opponents have said they intend to push for new
restrictions on abortions in many state legislatures. But
candidates who supported abortion rights won key elections last
fall, and pro-choice leaders claim public opinion has shifted to
their side.

   Here is the text of President Bush's remarks
from the Oval Office on Monday to the March for Life.
   I want to welcome all of you gathered in Washington from around
the country for this year's March for life.
   Before you begin the march, I want to take a minute to share my
deep personal concern about abortion on demand, which I oppose.
   For 17 years the March for Life has served as a poignant
reminder to all Americans that human life in all its forms must be

   The continuing strong presence of the March for Life reminds
those of us in decision-making capacities in the White House and in
the Congress and on the Court that millions of Americans care
fundamentally about this issue and are committed to preserving the
sanctity of life.
   Your movement also reminds Americans, especially young
Americans, of the self-evident moral superiority of adoption over
abortion. We should all be grateful to the families that adopt
babies, giving them care and love and a chance for a wonderful life.
   So ladies and gentlemen, let me assure that this president
stands with you on this issue of life. And that my prayers go out
to all of you for your faith and courage. God bless you and God
bless life. Thank you very much.

   Five months after a high school football
coach replaced a black quarterback with a less-experienced white
player, a chain of recriminations has embittered race relations in
this small town.
   Racial problems generally had stayed hidden in this bucolic town
of 14,000 residents. But the largely black protesters say the
boycott of the team, picketing of the school and weekly marches
that began in August are partly the result of longstanding
grievances.
   ``Conway very definitely has a problem with racism. America has
a problem with racism,'' said the Rev. H.H. Singleton, a former
science teacher who was fired by the all-white school board after
becoming a spokesman for boycotting black players. Conway's
population is 41 percent black.
   ``While these kinds of incidents have been happening all along,
the white community thinks it's nothing to get excited about,''
said Dr. William Gibson, a Greenville dentist and chairman of the
NAACP national board of directors. ``Yes, it angers them because
they're not used to it. They blame the person who is the victim
every time.''
   Said Mayor Ike Long, who is white: ``I don't think that Conway
had a racial problem as such until this thing came up. I don't know
that we have so much of a racial problem now.''
   The demonstrations began after Conway High's white football
coach, Chuck Jordan, switched quarterback Carlos Hunt, who is
black, to defensive back. Jordan replaced Hunt with Mickey Wilson
Jr., a less-experienced player and the son of an assistant coach.
   Jordan later said he made the change because Hunt refused to
follow his instructions on the field.
   Hunt wasn't happy with the switch, and neither were many of his
teammates. On Aug. 22, Singleton announced that 31 of the 37 black
players were boycotting the team to protest the quarterback change.
All but 10 of the striking players stayed out the entire season and
the team ended up with a 1-11 record.
   Less than a week after the walkout began, the parents of 61
white students enrolled in Singleton's science class at Conway
Middle School requested their children be assigned another teacher.
The following day, Horry County School Superintendent John Dawsey
suspended Singleton on the grounds he was disrupting school. The
school board fired Singleton, who also is pastor of Cherry Hill
Baptist Church, three months later.
   What followed were protest marches through town that drew
hundreds of marchers on several Saturdays; regular picketing
outside the high school; a two-day boycott of classes by black
students; and a promise by the NAACP to stage a political and
economic boycott in Horry County.
   An investigation by state Human Affairs Commissioner James
Clyburn determined the Hunt incident was not racially motivated.
Long appointed a bi-racial task force to study the issue.
   In general, Clyburn's findings were supported by the white
community and decried by blacks.
   Leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People say they will continue their protest until Singleton
is reinstated in his teaching job, and will press for other
changes. For one thing, they want a change in hiring practices for
schools in the town, which is 15 miles northwest of Myrtle Beach.
   A lengthy investigation by the state Human Affairs Commission
concluded last month that for the last decade, white job applicants
in Horry County schools have had a distinct advantage over blacks.
The investigation was begun before the dispute over the football
team arose.
   On Saturday, 1,000 people turned out for a protest march in
Myrtle Beach.
   ``It's a process that has to evolve,'' Gibson said. ``Horry
County is moving in that direction, but it hasn't arrived yet.
We're going to march in Conway a long time, a lot of times.''

   President Bush has invited the
presidents-elect of Brazil and Uruguay to meet with him at the
White House, his spokesman said today.
   He will meet Jan. 26 with Brazilian president-elect Fernando
Collor de Mello, then on Feb. 5 with the president-elect of
Uruguay, Luis Alberto LaCalle, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said.
   Fitzwater suggested the meetings are partly in response to
Bush's desire to reach out to Latin American leaders to ease
resentments from last month's invasion of Panama.
   The spokesman cited a ``continuing dialogue with Latin America
on political and economic issues.''
   ``Democracy in the region'' will be high on the agenda of both
meetings, Fitzwater said.
   At Bush's behest, Vice President Dan Quayle leaves Saturday on a
goodwill mission to Honduras, Jamaica and Panama. He plans to visit
several other Latin American nations in March.

<HEAD>Romanian Leader Says 120 Bullets Taken from Ceausescus' Bodies</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Romania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only five volunteers were asked to execute deposed
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife last month, but the entire
80-man firing squad insisted on shooting, a member of Romania's
interim government told a newspaper.
   Silviu Brucan, a member of the 11-member executive council of
the National Salvation Front, told the daily newspaper Le Figaro
that the enthusiasm of the firing squad reflected the popular
support for the Dec. 25 execution.
   ``I can tell you that when the firing squad was formed, the
officer in command asked for five soldiers to step forward and
prepare to fire. The squad was made up of 80 men. All fired at the
same moment. They found 120 bullet holes in the bodies of Nicolae
and Elena Ceausescu,'' Brucan said in the interview, published
Monday.
   Some Western nations criticized the new Romanian leaders for
conducting the trial of the Ceausescus in secret. Parts of the
trial later were shown on state television.
   Brucan said the leaders of Romania's revolution would have
prefered to hold a public trial, ``but in the context of Dec. 24,
that was utopic.''
   ``That Sunday was the most dangerous for the Romanian
revolution,'' he said, recalling in the interview that the state
Securitate was on the offensive and had attacked the TV station.
   ``We thought there was a risk of the Securitate attacking the
barracks where Ceausescu and his wife were being detained. If they
had been freed and retaken by their men, it would have been a
bloodbath in Romania,'' Brucan told the newspaper.
   He added that after it was announced that Ceausescu was dead and
state TV showed pictures of his body, ``the unity of the Securitate
began to fall apart.''
   Brucan said about 10,000 people died during the violence in
December, but that life has begun to return to normal. But, he
added, it could be many years before the country achieved democracy
and the kind of open political system hoped for by his countrymen.
   ``Our people should learn democracy, and us as well, we should
learn to govern democratically,'' he told the newspaper. ``In 10
years, social life will achieve an equalibrium. But for democracy,
it will take 20 years. In any case, that is my opinion.''

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   DRUG TESTS
   
   The court, giving another signal that it is willing to allow
random drug testing of government employees in sensitive positions,
rejected appeals by Justice Department employees and civilian Army
counselors.
   The justices, in their first drug-testing rulings, last March
upheld drug and alcohol tests for railway workers involved in
accidents and for U.S. Customs Service employees applying for jobs
in drug enforcement or jobs that require carrying a gun.
   Neither of those rulings, however, determined the
constitutionality of randomly administered drug tests.
   Today the court, without comment, rejected appeals by Justice
Department employees with top security clearance and civilian Army
drug and alcohol counselors who said mandatory random tests violate
their privacy rights.
   The cases are National Federation of Federal Employees vs.
Cheney, 89-635, and Bell vs. Thornburgh, 89-679.
   
   JURORS
   
   The court ruled in the case of a convicted white rapist that
fair-trial rights are not violated when blacks are excluded from
serving as jurors.
   But the 5-4 ruling in an Illinois case did not leave white
defendants powerless to challenge the exclusion of blacks from
their juries. The court left unanswered whether such race-based
exclusions ever discriminate unlawfully against white defendants.
   The dissenters said the decision condones racial bias in jury
selection.
   The case is Holland vs. Illinois, 88-5050.
   
   NUCLEAR SAFETY
   
   The court agreed to decide whether nuclear industry
``whistleblowers'' who say they were disciplined for complaining
about lax safety may sue under state personal-injury laws.
   The justices said they will review a North Carolina case in
which a federal appeals court said such workers must sue under a
special federal law.
   The case is English vs. General Electric, 89-152.
   
   LEGAL FEES
   
   The court agreed to use a decade-long dispute over the rights of
Haitian refugees to decide when the government must pay legal fees
to people who sue it successfully.
   The court said it will hear a Bush administration appeal aimed
at limiting such fees.
   The case is Commissioner of INS vs. Jean, 89-601.
   
   ARBITRATION
   
   The court refused to require arbitration for hundreds of
thousands of federal workers when they are fired, demoted or
otherwise disciplined.
   The court, without comment, rejected appeals by a labor union
and the Federal Labor Relations Authority seeking broader job
protection for federal employees.
   The cases are National Treasury Employees Union vs. Treasury
Department, 89-610, and Federal Labor Relations Authority vs.
Treasury Department, 89-758.
   
   LAWYERS
   
   The court ruled that lawyers in the nation's capital violated
antitrust law when they went ``on strike'' to demand higher pay
from the city for representing poor criminal defendants.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court said the boycott was ``a plain
violation of antitrust laws.''
   The case now goes back to a lower court to consider reinstating
an order by the Federal Trade Commission that prohibits the lawyers
in Washington from engaging in similar conduct in the future.
   The case is FTC vs. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Association,
88-1198.
   
   FARMERS
   
   The court turned away a challenge to a bank's foreclosure on an
Oregon couple seeking to hold onto a farm in their family since
1853.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the federal
law Myron and Jane Harper relied on in their legal fight gives only
the government, not farmers, the right to sue.
   A federal appeals court ruling in the Harpers' case set binding
law in nine western states, and involves a farm-loan program
totaling over $50 billion nationwide.
   The case is Harper vs. Federal Land Bank of Spokane, 89-863.
   
   VOTING RIGHTS ACT
   
   The court ruled that a Bibb County, Ga., school bond referendum
attacked by blacks as a violation of the federal Voting Rights Act
was legal.
   The court, without waiting to hear arguments in the case, upheld
a ruling that permitted the county's voters to approve $29 million
to air-condition existing schools and build a new high school.
   The justices' decision was not accompanied by any written
opinion. There was no recorded dissenting vote.
   The case is Lucas vs. Townsend, 89-400.
   
   ABORTION PICKETS
   
   The court refused to revive a federal civil rights lawsuit by
five people prosecuted for anti-abortion picketing outside a San
Diego medical clinic.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a decision dismissing
allegations that the clinic's operators violated the pickets'
free-speech rights.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last June 23 threw out
$11,800 awards each of the five pickets had won in a federal trial.
   The case is Collins vs. Womancare, 89-819.
   
   HOME ADDRESSES
   
   The court refused to let public employee labor unions get from
the government the home addresses of federal workers.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the
workers' privacy would be violated if government agencies are
forced to divulge the information to the unions.
   The cases are American Federation of Government Employees vs.
Department of Health and Human Services, 89-444; National Treasury
Employees Union vs. Treasury Department, 89-566; and Federal Labor
Relations Authority vs. Treasury Department, 89-853.
   
   LIBEL SUIT
   
   The court today agreed to review a former high school wrestling
coach's 15-year-old libel lawsuit against an Ohio newspaper, a case
that reached the high court twice previously.
   The justices said they will review an Ohio Supreme Court ruling
that threw out Michael Milkovich's 1975 suit against the News
Herald of Lake County.
   The case is Milkovich vs. Lorain Journal Co., 89-645.
   
   SAVINGS AND LOAN
   
   The court scuttled a federal lawsuit stemming from the collapse
of the Old Court Savings &amp; Loan Association in Maryland, saying
state courts may handle suits based on a federal anti-racketeering
law.
   The justices unanimously ruled that lower federal courts rightly
dismissed the suit because similar suits were being handled by
state courts in Maryland.
   The case is Tafflin vs. Levitt, 88-1650.

   Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders agreed today to
remove armed groups from the border between the new republics in an
attempt to end clashes that have led to at least 167 deaths, Tass
said.
   The Soviet news agency said the agreement came during a meeting
of Armenian and Azerbaijani government officials in the border town
of Yeraskh. But it would need the approval of armed militants on
both sides.
   In the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, hundreds of thousands of
Azerbaijanis massed today to bury scores of countrymen killed by
Soviet troops dispatched to end the ethnic violence, witnesses said.
   The official Tass news agency said 83 people were killed
Saturday in an assault by Soviet troops in Baku or in skirmishes
the previous day.
   The ethnic violence flared Jan. 13 with anti-Armenian riots in
Baku, a oil-producing center of 1.7 million people on the Caspian
Sea, and spread throughout Azerbaijan and Armenia.
   The neighboring republics are locked in a decades-old dispute
over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of Azerbaijan that is populated
mainly by Armenians. Armenians are predominately Christians said the night
had
been peaceful.
   A political scientist who teaches at the Azerbaijan Academy of
Sciences, Jahun Mulazade, reported scattered gunfire early today
but said Soviet military forces generally appeared in control of
the city.
   Azerbaijani activists claimed the death toll in the military
assault was much higher than the official figure. Yusif Bagirov, an
attorney and member of an independent investigatory commission
created by Baku lawyers, asserted that 1,000 civilians were killed
in the district that encompasses Baku.
   He said at least 94 bodies were in coffins borne through Baku's
streets for burial today.
   An emergency overnight session of the Azerbaijani legislature
demanded the withdrawal of Soviet army and Interior Ministry troops
from the republic, with the exception of border districts with
Armenia, said another Baku lawyer, Viliyad Mamedov, who attended
the 11{-hour meeting.
   Lawmakers also demanded the lifting of the curfew in Baku and
the state of emergency Gorbachev declared in much of Azerbaijan one
week ago, Mamedov said by telephone.
   If those demands are not met, Mamedov said, the legislature will
consider voting to secede from the Soviet Union.
   In Baku, radio, television and means of public transport except
the city's metro were not working today due to the general strike,
Mula-Zade said.
   It was not clear who called the strike, but Radio Moscow blamed
the grass-roots Azerbaijani People's Front, which it said was
trying to ``fan hostility and breed popular resentment toward the
Soviet army.'
   Foreign reporters were barred from Armenia and Azerbaijan so it
was difficult to determine the exact death toll.
   About 29,000 Soviet troops, police, cadets and interior ministry
forces are reported combating the violence in the southern region.
The number of militants has been reported to be in the thousands.
   Sheikh Ul Islam, the spiritual leader of Azerbaijani Moslems,
condemned the Saturday assault on Baku in an address to world and
religious leaders sent to Azerinform today.
   In Moscow, world chess champion Garri Kasparov today said the
Soviet assault on his native Baku was too late to save the
terrorized Armenian population.
   ``I fear that what is now happening in Azerbaijan may lead to a
terrible bloodbath in the whole country,'' said Kasparov, of Jewish
and Armenian parentage, who fled Baku with 60 relatives and friends.

   A graduate student was engaged in no
juvenile prank when he created a ``worm'' program that paralyzed
thousands of computers throughout the nation in 1988, a prosecutor
contended this morning.
   Robert T. Morris, 25, of Arnold, Md., is the first person
brought to trial under a section of the 1986 Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act that makes it a felony to break into a federal computer
network and prevent authorized use of the system. Closing arguments
in his federal trial began this morning.
   Ellen Meltzer, a trial lawyer for the U.S. Justice Department,
said Morris deliberately stole computer passwords from hundreds of
people so the worm could break into as many computers as possible.
   And she said Morris, who had testified that he never intended
for the worm program to cause such harm, took deliberate and
conscious steps to make the rogue program difficult to detect and
eradicate.
   ``This was not a mistake,'' she said. ``Robert Morris worked
diligently at creating this worm ... at trying to make it better.''
   But Morris' lawyer, Thomas Guidoboni, contended in his closing
arguments that didn't intend to cause, and did not cause, permanent
damage to any computer files when he unleased the worm.
   ``There was no work lost; work was delayed. That's the bottom
line,'' Guidoboni said.
   He said that once Morris realized the worm had gone berserk, he
took steps to try to stop it. When that failed, Guidoboni said
Morris had friends send out a message on an electronic bulletin
board with instructions how to defeat the worm.
   ``Does a person who intends unauthoritized use or to cause a
system to crash send out a message to stop it? Of course not,''
Guidoboni said.
   Following this morning's closing arguments, U.S. District Court
Judge Howard Munson sent the jury to lunch. He was expected to
instruct jurors and give them the case this afternoon.
   There is mixed feeling among those who testified over whether
the suspended Cornell University graduate student should be
severely punished for what he said was an experiment that ran out
of control.
   ``I don't think he did anything wrong,'' said Paul Graham, a
government witness who became friends with Morris at Harvard and
knew of Morris' work on the worm.
   Graham said Morris should not be punished because the worm was
``an intellectual experiment'' common among computer security
students and the only practical way to test whether security holes
they find really exist.
   ``A lot of computer security people, while in graduate school,
spend time breaking into systems. The government has decided it
doesn't want them to do this anymore,'' Graham said. ``They want
them to learn about computer security from reading books.''
   But Eugene Spafford, a Purdue University computer ethics
professor who has written about the worm and testified as a
government witness, said Morris committed vandalism and should be
punished accordingly.
   He said Morris' defense that he didn't mean to paralyze the
Internet network, which links computers at major universities, NASA
and several military facilities, is like an arsonist saying he
didn't mean for the fire he started to cause any damage.
   Most of the nearly dozen computer systems managers from
facilities attacked by the worm said Morris should be convicted but
should not be dealt a harsh sentence.
   ``I'd like to see an uncontested conviction and a light
sentence,'' said Michael Muuss, leader of the Advanced Computer
Systems team at the U.S. Army Ballistics Research Laboratory in
Aberdeen, Md.
   ``I think the conviction would be a deterrent enough for others
thinking about something like this,'' he said.
   Morris admitted last Thursday on the witness stand that he
designed the worm specifically to infect Internet. He said the worm
was an experiment that turned into a ``dismal failure'' because of
a programming error he made that caused it to replicate wildly once
it entered a computer.
   It took several days to eliminate the worm. The rogue program
was originally termed a computer ``virus,'' but unlike viruses it
did not require a ``host'' program to reproduce.
   Although the indictment charged the worm did about $1,000 in
damage, computer experts estimated that the time computers were
down and the labor needed to combat the worm cost $5 million to $12
million.
   The worm was only supposed to break into a handful of the
180,000 computers on Internet and then just leave a single copy of
itself in all but a few machines, Morris said.
   ``It was a mistake and I'm sorry,'' were Morris' last words as
he stepped off the witness stand.

   Mayor Marion Barry's arrest on a drug charge
could do some good as a cautionary tale for white collar drug
users, especially government officials who might believe they'll
never get caught, criminologists suggest.
   Indeed, private queries at some drug treatment centers increased
sharply after the arrest.
   But people well-versed on the subject say such concern by
possible users usually doesn't last. And no one is predicting much,
if any, impact on the drug trade in general.
   Most drug distributors and sellers ``are very cynical about the
way the world operates,'' said criminologist Richard R. Bennett of
American University. ``They're going to say, `Mayor Barry got
caught. It's the price you pay for playing the game.' ... They
expect their leaders to be cunning and deviant and deceptive,
because that's how they operate on their day-to-day basis.''
   At the same time, Geoffrey P. Alpert, University of South
Carolina criminal justice professor, said the arrest's impact on
drug users ``is a very important one, that you cannot be above the
law.''
   ``It gives a message to the white collar user,'' he said. ``It
also gives a message to government officials, and that is that no
matter how hard you try to hide your use of narcotics, and
particularly cocaine, you can get caught, you can get arrested.''
   Barry, who was arrested Thursday night, has not commented
directly on the charge of cocaine possession, but his lawyer has
said he will plead not guilty. The mayor left the city Monday for a
treatment center.
   Dr. Errol Segall, director of chemical dependence services at
Dominion Hospital in Falls Church, Va., reported that phone calls
to the hospital have ``increased three- to four-fold since the
story broke.''
   ``During a crisis time, people come forth with questions, with
concerns,'' Segall said. ``It's a breakthrough of their denial
systems, and so they reach out. Unfortunately, once a crisis like
this episode is past, the denial level sort of goes back up. And
that's what keeps drug problems going, is a sense of denial.''
   Roger Chapin, president of the 300,000-member Citizens for a
Drug Free America, said he doubts Barry's arrest will have much
impact because ``an awful lot of people have suspected for a long
time that he was a user.''
   If another prominent mayor turned out to be a drug user, that
would ``shake a lot of people,'' Chapin said.
   Bennett said District of Columbia children are likely to be
rattled by the arrest.
   ``The idea of this guy getting up before us two days before
saying, `We're doing something, we're winning the war on drugs,'
... I think it sends a very confusing message to a lot of inner
city black kids who look up to Marion Barry as an idol. I think
that is going to hurt us.''
   Dr. Alfred Blumstein, dean of the School of Urban and Public
Affairs at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said the
arrest's impact is ``going to depend critically on how the mayor
plays it.''
   ``If he plays the sympathy angle, and I gather that's where he's
going, I think he can use that as an opportunity to dedicate
himself not only to his own salvation, but as part of the message
to the larger community, to say, `Look at the evil that can befall
one when one gets messed up with drugs,''' Blumstein said in an
interview Monday.
   The arrest demonstrates that, ``The war on drugs ultimately is
going to have to get at demand issues,'' Blumstein said. ``It's
clear that as long as the demand is maintained, the supply side
will find a way to meet it, whether through new sources of supply,
new ports of entry, or new drugs.''

   High seas and wind hampered a search today
for six people missing after a charter fishing boat smashed against
a jetty at the mouth of a river, and officials said rescue hopes
were dwindling.
   One woman died and two other people aboard the Gambler were
rescued after the 45-foot boat capsized Sunday in 15-foot swells
while crossing a bar at the mouth of the Quillayute River about 110
miles west of Seattle.
   A helicopter, a lifeboat and beach crews searched for the
missing men today. Visibility was good but seas ran 16 to 18 feet
with wind blowing at 25 to 30 mph.
   During the night, the search was hampered by 20-foot seas, wind
of 15 mph to 25 mph and fog that frequently reduced visibility to
near zero, the Coast Guard said. Six people patrolled the Pacific
beach overnight, said Coast Guard Quartermaster 1st Class Robert
Goodrich.
   ``None of the (missing) people were wearing any life jackets,''
Goodrich said. ``I'm sure you can read between the lines, but we're
just hoping for the best.''
   Paula Becker was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital
after she, Jerry Nelson and Ron Wilson, both believed to be in
their 20s, were plucked from the water by a Coast Guard helicopter
from Port Angeles, officials said. Nelson and Wilson were listed in
stable condition at Forks Community Hospital.
   The charter boat owner and operator, Jeffrey Andersen, was among
the missing.
   Ernie McGill, a worker at a nearby resort who witnessed the
capsizing about 3 p.m. PST, said the tide had just turned as the

   ``The water started boiling ... and the boat was pushed into the

   Demonstrators carried the battle for the hearts and minds of
Americans on the abortion issue to state capitals today to
commemorate the 17th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe vs.
Wade ruling.
   The demonstrations began Sunday, when an estimated 25,000 to
30,000 people joined dueling rallies in Phoenix, while supporters
of legalized abortion sang and chanted in Albany, N.Y., and
opponents held ``baby showers'' for poor women who choose to have
children in Provo, Utah.
   Demonstrations also were held in Boston, Raleigh, N.C., and
Spokane, Wash.
   Today, there were rallies by both sides in Washington, D.C., by
anti-abortion groups in Trenton, N.J., and Salt Lake City, and by a
pro-choice group in Baton Rouge, La. In Indianapolis, bells tolled
at a a dozen churches to mark the day, rung 25 times ``one time for
every million babies killed since 1973,'' said Right to Life
spokeswoman Kathleen Porter
   In Baton Rouge, the newly formed Coalition for Reproductive
Freedom wound a 200-foot ribbon around the state Capitol steps as a
symbol of their support for Roe vs. Wade.
   In Trenton, about 150 protesters marched in front of the New
Jersey Statehouse, the site of recent debates over a bill to
require notification of parents whose minor daughters seek
abortions. A similar protest at the Utah Capitol also drew about
150 abortion opponents.
   Debate began today on a parental notification bill pending
before the Nebraska Legislature, but the legislators got bogged
down on time-consuming amendments proposed by a critic of the bill
and adjourned without taking action.
   In Dallas, the attorney who argued the case that legalized
abortion 17 years ago spoke to pro-choice advocates at a
commemorative breakfast today.
   ``We are here to say we won 17 years ago today, and we will win
again,'' Sarah Weddington said.
   In Sunday's rallies, speakers called for renewed action by state
legislatures following a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision
modifying Roe vs. Wade, which legalized abortion in this country.
The summer decision, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services,
allowed states to regulate abortion in some cases.
   ``Some political candidates have slid down the slippery slope of
accommodation, changing their positions from pro-life to
pro-abortion in order to gain votes,'' Mary Ellen Bork, the wife of
rejected Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, told a rally in Boston.
   But, she told opponents of legalized abortion, ``this is not a
time to wallow in discouragement.''
   Other rallies were held Saturday. For abortion opponents, the
weekend of activity was to culminate today with a march on the U.S.
Capitol and other demonstrations around the country. President Bush
was scheduled to address the Washington ``March for Life.''
   Demonstrators Sunday were peaceful. In Phoenix, both sides
displayed hundreds of American flags and invoked the spirit of the
late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Shouts were
exchanged, but police and rally marshals from both groups kept the
peace.
   In Southern California, 5,000 people linked arms to line the
sides of Beach Boulevard along parts of a five-mile stretch through
the cities of Anaheim and Westminster to dramatize their opposition
to abortion.
   Bagpipes played in Little Rock, Ark., where an estimated 10,000
to 17,000 demonstrators marched in opposition to abortion.
   In Provo, Utah, a right-to-life group sponsored several ``baby
showers'' to gather donated maternity clothes and baby gifts for
needy women who spurned abortion.
   Several thousand demonstrators opposed to abortion gathered for
a day of speeches and song at the state Capitol in Oklahoma City.
   About 600 oppoents of legalized abortion in Concord, N.H.,
placed wreaths outside the city dump to mourn discarded fetuses,
while 75 women and a few men held a candlelight vigil in St. Paul,
Minn., to remember women who have died in illegal abortions.
   In Albany, N.Y., abortion-rights activists, some of whom arrived
on cross-country skis in a heavy snowstorm, chanted, sang and
shouted a pledge to lobby their view in the statehouse. As they met
in the legislative office building, about 60 people demonstrated
against abortion.
   ``I pledge not to vote for or support with my money or my time
any candidate for any office who does not fully support and work
for women's equality and the right to safe, legal and accessible
abortion,'' the crowd shouted out in response to Marilyn Fitterman,
president of the New York State chapter of the National
Organization for Women.

<HEAD>AIDS Official Doubts Wisdom Of Children's AIDS Study</HEAD>

   A leading government researcher expressed
concern about the continuation of a study in which more than 300
children with AIDS are not getting the drug AZT, now widely
believed to be effective in children.
   Half the children in the study are getting an unproven drug
called intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIG. Half are getting only a
placebo, lacking any beneficial ingredients.
   In October, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
acted to make AZT widely available to children, saying there was
enough preliminary evidence the drug was effective and safe. AZT is
the only anti-AIDS drug so far approved for routine use.
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the national program to test
and evaluate potential anti-AIDS drugs, said he believes the time
has come to give all patients access to AZT, and said he has
expressed his doubts about the children's study.
   ``I questioned that many, many months ago,'' Fauci said in an
interview Sunday during the New York-Italy Medical Symposium.
   Fauci also has set up a trial to test intravenous
immunoglobulin, but in his trial the children receiving IVIG and
those receiving a placebo are all receiving AZT as well.
   ``I made sure in our own institute that a trial was done which
included an AZT arm,'' said Fauci. ``I don't feel comfortable with
a placebo-controlled trial at this stage,'' he said.
   Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., which operates the national
AIDS drug-testing program.
   The director of the experiment he questioned _ Dr. Anne
Willoughby of the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development in Bethesda _ has emphasized that children in her trial
were not being denied AZT. In fact, however, few are receiving it.
   Of the 347 children in the trial, 31 are getting AZT. That
leaves 316 who are either receiving IVIG alone or are receiving
nothing. The children are being treated at more than two dozen
centers across the country, Willoughby said.
   ``There is a legitimate difference of opinion about the status
of this study,'' Willoughby said. She said she would like to see
more data on the trials of AZT in children before she was convinced
of its effectiveness.
   Several researchers interviewed by The Associated Press were
critical of Willoughby's study, agreeing with Fauci that children
should be given AZT. The most vocal of them was Dr. Philip Pizzo,
chief of the pediatrics branch at the National Cancer Institute.
   Willoughby said he has more experience than anyone else on the
use of AZT in children.
   ``The issue of immunoglobulin alone might have been timely three
or four years ago,'' Pizzo has said. ``But in 1989, not having AZT
... means that the potential benefit of the drug, particularly to
children's nervous systems, is being lost.''
   Pizzo's studies have shown that AZT can stop or even reverse
damage to the brain and central nervous system in children. As a
result, some children who had lost the ability to speak or walk
have recovered those abilities, Pizzo has reported.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   As of Nov. 30, the latest date for which figures are available,
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control had received reports of 1,947
cases of children with AIDS and 1,059 deaths.
   Dr. Keith Krasinski, a pediatrician at New York University
Medical Center who is helping to conduct Willoughby's experiment,
disagrees with Pizzo.
   ``It would be premature to say that AZT is the standard of
therapy,'' Krasinski has said.
   Willoughby said the study's data safety and monitoring board, an
independent group that could halt the trial if it were considered
unethical, has repeatedly approved its continuation.
   Researchers disagree over the potential usefulness of
immunoglobulin. Some have found that it can help reduce the
frequency of bacterial infections in children with AIDS. Others say
the studies so far are too preliminary to be conclusive.

<HEAD>NAACP Chief Suggests Possible Racism in D.C. Mayor's Cocaine Case</HEAD>

   The head of the NAACP today questioned whether
the cocaine arrest of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry was
part of a pattern of harassment of elected black officials and
``the rising tide of racism in this nation.''
   NAACP Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks commented to
reporters after meeting for the second time in two weeks with
President Bush on the recent wave of bombings and threats against
civil rights targets in the South.
   Hooks, who led a delegation of 17 NAACP leaders to the White
House, said afterward he was ``fairly satisfied'' with the
administration's actions in the case.
   Hooks said the delegation and Bush did not discuss Barry's
arrest at a Washington hotel last Thursday night. The president has
had no comment on it, except to say Sunday that it was ``very sad.''
   ``I'm not trying to justify any wrongdoing'' or condone use of
cocaine, Hooks said, but ``I am opposed to selective enforcement of
the law.''
   The NAACP leader said newspaper accounts of Barry's arrest in an
FBI sting operation made it sound like ``the search had finally
paid off. We spent all of these years trying to find him with a
grain of cocaine, and by God we did it, didn't we?
   ``We haven't found all the people who've stolen all the money
from the savings and loan associations and are driving Rolls Royces
and Jaguars, so obviously many of us in the black community will
have some peculiar feelings as we go further,'' said Hooks.
   A reporter then asked: ``You're not saying it's wrong to bring
somebody to justice for violating the law, are you, Dr. Hooks?''
   ``No, I think you ought to bring everybody to justice for
violating the law,'' he eplied. ``That would have meant most of us
here would be arrested for speeding, spitting on the sidewalk or
something. If we can afford to do it, let's do it.''
   ``I simply said that there will be in the minds of many blacks
the continued feeling that there has been undue harassment of black
elected officials. To the extent that that fits into this
conference, the rising tide of racism in this nation, it is
something we want to examine,'' Hooks said.
   Hooks did not give any other examples of harassment of black
elected officials.
   Bush also met today with actor-strongman Arnold Schwarzenegger,
the new chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness.
   He also planned a midday address by telephone from the Oval
Office to support anti-abortion activists' ``March for Life,''
rallying at a park behind the White House.
   Hooks also visited the White House on Jan. 9 to discuss the wave
of bombings and threats against civil rights targets in the South.
He came this time with 16 other officials, including Dr. William F.
Gibson, a Greenville, S.C., dentist and chairman of the NAACP board.
   Also attending the meeting were Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
and FBI Director William Sessions.
   Gibson said the administration officials told them there was
``some movement'' in finding those who mailed bombs that killed a
federal judge in Birmingham, Ala., and a civil rights lawyer in
Savannah, Ga., as well as others mailed to the federal courthouse
in Atlanta and the NAACP office in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Hooks said he had asked Bush for another meeting to discuss
other concerns of the 600,000-member civil rights group.
   Today's ``March for Life'' came on the 17th anniversary of the
Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade ruling that struck down state laws
against abortion.
   During a similar march in January 1989, Bush called abortion on
demand ``our American tragedy.'' He said, ``I think the Supreme
Court's decision in Roe vs. Wade was wrong and should be
overturned. I think America needs a human life amendment.''
   ``When it comes to abortion, there's a better way: the way of
adoption, the way of life,'' he said then.
   Bush once took a more permissive view of abortion, but changed
his position by the time he became Ronald Reagan's running mate in
1980. Now he opposes abortion except to save the mother's life or
in cases of rape or incest, and he favors federal funding of
abortion only to save the mother's life.
   Newsweek magazine reported Sunday that the president and his
family are deeply divided on the issue, with all the women
pro-choice and all the men anti-abortion.
   The magazine said it had learned that Bush and his wife Barbara
discussed the issue at a recent family gathering with their
children and spouses.
   ``The family split down the middle,'' the magazine said, without
identifying its source. ``All the women were pro-choice; all the
men anti-abortion.''
   It added that some of the women, including the first lady, said
abortion should not be without controls, but they believed in a
woman's right to choose in certain circumstances.
   Mrs. Bush has refused to answer reporters' questions about her
personal views on abortion.

   City Administrator Carol Thompson, who will be
in charge of the District of Columbia government while Mayor Marion
Barry receives treatment, said today that there was no ``management
vaccuum.''
   ``The day-to-day management of this government has been and
continues to be a team effort,'' Ms. Thompson said at a news
conference. The top managers are ``competent professionals'' who
have acted in Barry's absence before, she added.
   Barry turned over his administrative role to Ms. Thompson on
Friday, the day after he was arrested on a misdemeanor cocaine
possession charge.
   She asked the media and critics to give her time to
``fine-tune'' the operations.
   Top officials will be in contact with Barry to provide him with
information and recommendations on the decisions which could not be
turned over to her, Ms. Thompson said. Those include the signing
and vetoing of legislation and signing contracts.
   ``There will be no loss in the quality of existing programs and
services provided by the government,'' Madelyn Andrews, spokeswoman
for Ms. Thompson said. ``(Ms. Thompson) will also underscore the
strong commitment of the government to maintain stability and
continuity.''
   Several City Council members, including Chairman David A.
Clarke, also stressed that governmental services will continue
unhindered.
   ``The leaders of the council met with the city administrator and
the corporation counsel,'' said Clarke. ``We pledged to the city
administrator and she pledged to us cooperation.''
   Another council member, Charlene Drew Jarvis, said, ``What we
need to do now is to assure some stability and continuity in the
government.''
   Clarke, Mrs. Jarvis and councilman John Ray are announced
candidates for the Democratic mayoral nomination.
   A Thompson aide, who asked not to be identified, said the city
administrator was sensitive to the awkward moments Barry's
departure could create.
   ``She does not see herself as acting mayor but more as a city
administrator with a few extra duties,'' said the aide. ``For
instance, I would be very surprised if she (moved from) her office
and started working behind the mayor's desk.''
   One key department head, Corrections Director Walter Ridley,
said Barry's departure from the daily routine will ``make a lot of
difference on a feeling level.''
   ``He's is going to be missed,'' Ridley told The Washington Post.
``You can't lose a Marion Barry and not expect for there to be some
trauma.''
   One of Ms. Thompson's major tasks will be balancing the current
budget and finalizing the budget for the upcoming fiscal year which
must be submitted to the council in early February. Barry has
estimated the shortfall for the current year at between $70 million
and $80 million.
   Ms. Thompson likely will leave her imprint on the budgets, the
aide said.
   ``She tends to be more conservative (than Barry),'' said the
aide. ``She is not going to jump out and say `We're going to fund
this program' unless she first knows where the money is coming
from.''
   Aides said she also is scheduled to make a decisio soon on how
to improve the city's ambulance service, which has been plagued by
reports of slow service and poor medical training for paramedics.
   Under the city charter, Ms. Thompson has all the powers of the
mayor except the ability to sign or veto legislation and approve
contracts.
   Barry has said he will remain in daily contact with her. It was
not known, however, how much his activities would be restricted if
he enters a treatment program, as expected.
   Another councilman, John Wilson, who is running for council
chairman, said he was concerned that Congress could use the
opportunity to change the city's ``home rule'' powers or deny an
extension of powers in the future.
   One cabinet member suggested that many of the mayor's appointees
will now find themselves in limbo until Barry decides what to do.
   ``It will be Carol's challenge to motivate those people, get
them to do something productive, instead of sitting around waiting
for the other shoe to drop,'' said the Barry aide, who asked not to
be identified. ``Some of the more politically oriented offices,
ones that are there primarily to give the mayor good exposure on
issues, are going to have less to do for a while.''

   The parents of an Indianapolis teen-ager who
died from complications of an illegal abortion said Monday that
their daughter's case was a tragic consequence of a parental
consent law.
   ``Our daughter was punished,'' said Bill Bell, father of Becky
Bell, who was 17 when she died Sept. 16, 1988. ``She was denied a
reasonable and safe choice because she loved her parents and died
not wanting to disappoint them.''
   Bill and his wife, Karen, spoke to reporters at a pro-choice
gathering on the Mall near the Capitol where a temporary memorial
was erected in tribute to girls and women who have died from
illegal abortions.
   Indiana law requires a minor to obtain parental consent or have
the provision waived by a court before she can have an abortion.
Twenty-six states have parental consent laws, said Eleanor Smeal,
president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority.
   Bell said that his daughter did not tell her parents she was
pregnant and that her best friend told them after Becky died that
their daughter had told her she didn't want to disappoint her
parents because she loved them.
   At home, the teen-ager became ill and when she began
hemorrhaging her parents took her to a hospital, where she died a
short time later. Doctors told the Bells that Becky had had an
illegal abortion.
   The Bells said that had their daughter told them she was
pregnant, they would have let her decide whether to have an
abortion.
   ``Our daughter's fate was decided by others. Parental consent
laws clearly denied her a safe option,'' said Bell, his voice
breaking. ``How many more young women will share Becky's fate if we
allow our government to deny them a safe choice?''
   Karen Bell said other parents will face the same kind of tragedy
unless parental consent laws are changed.
   ``If you think it can't happen to you, God help you,'' she said.

   A lonesome moose that wandered south
into the Berkshires where there are no other moose has been smitten
by a herd of dairy cows.
   ``He's there every day,'' said Frank Montague, who has been
running Bridgmont Farm while his son is on vacation.
   The moose has been hanging around the farm since Jan. 10, he
said, and at one point even broke down a fence to get closer to the
cows.
   Ralph Taylor, a state wildlife official, said the moose should
be out of rut by now, but perhaps is being kept sexually active by
the proximity of heifers in heat.
   ``If they scare him away and keep him away from the cows for a
couple of days it should be OK,'' Taylor said.
   But Montague said that is easier said than done.
   ``They said to make a racket, throw something at him,
whatever,'' he said. ``But there's not much you can really do.''

   Nebraskans are learning that some of the
things commonly believed about China _ especially concerning its
food _ are just not true, thanks to 18 Chinese students attending
Dana College.
   For example, they never heard of Chinese fortune cookies until
they arrived in America.
   The graduate students attending Dana's English Language
Institute also said they found it difficult to adjust to much of
what passes for Chinese cooking in this country because the
vegetables are cooked too much.
   ``But we are glad to be at Dana. We like it very much,'' said
Liu Ping.
   Sybille Bartels, program director of the college's department of
languages, said: ``It's a delight when they invite us to a Chinese
dinner they cook. It's excellent, especially their dumplings.''
   Zhang Xian, 35, a high school teacher and mother from Shanghai,
laughed at the informality of American college life.
   ``In China you can't be as friendly with the school president,''
she said. ``Here teachers sit on their desks and drink coffee.
People say `excuse me' to almost anything but teachers don't say
excuse me when they sit on their table while teaching.''

   Unlike most Eastern Washington University
students who hop aboard a cross-town bus to attend classes, Yvonne
Jones boards a commuter airline for a 45-minute trip across the
entire state.
   Three days a week, Mrs. Jones takes an Alaska Airlines 737 from
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to Spokane, about a 15-mile
drive from the EWU campus at Cheney.
   It's a long way to travel for a degree in Spanish, but Mrs.
Jones, a former stewardess whose husband works as a mechanic for
the airline, said she prefers soaring above the clouds for the
280-mile trip to riding through Seattle's rush hour traffic. And
her husband's job gets her a discount fare.
   ``From my first visit, I liked the helpful people and the small
town atmosphere,'' she said. ``When I drive to Cheney, I have the
road to myself. I'm not used to that.''
   She keeps one car in Seattle and one at Spokane.
   Her husband, Robert, said he agrees with his wife's decision,
although he was reluctant at first. ``I told her I thought she
could spend about the same and get those classes here,'' he said.
``But she is strong-willed.''

   Hats off to radiation treatment, Sammy Davis Jr.
says, but it was really the kindness of friends and strangers that
pulled him through.
   ``A hundred letters a day is a lot of mail, you know, for
somebody who ain't got a hit series or hit records,'' Davis, 64,
said in the Jan. 29 issue of People magazine. ``It was such an
outpouring, it was unbelievable.''
   He said Frank Sinatra and Bill Cosby offered their planes to fly
him to Paris and New York for treatment for throat cancer. Liza
Minnelli showed up at his home, bags in hand, and stayed for four
days. Jerry Lewis scoured the medical community for the right
doctor. Steve Lawrence said he ``tried to cheer him up, kinda like
a wife.''
   For inspiration, Davis turned to his friend Jill Ireland, who
has been fighting cancer for years _ and a seven-year-old boy he
met in a hospital.
   ``He had no hair, he had no legs, and here I am complaining
about what by comparison was nothing but a minor inconvenience,''
he said. ``From that day on, I think, I stopped feeling sorry for

   A movie about himself, in a script written by childhood chum and

``We're shooting the whole thing in Cincinnati, where it takes

   It's budgeted for only $5 million, peanuts compared to his usual

   ``I realized when Annie wrote the script that there was no (big
budget) value in my childhood, none whatsoever,'' he said. ``It's
basically based on experiences we had, friends of ours. It's more a
comedy than an intimate portrait of our growing up.''

lynching of anybody involved in drugs and call for a slow death for
child abusers by leaving them for alligators and rattlesnakes.
   ``When I say I'm a simple man, it's simple attitudes,'' Daniels
said. ``Obviously, I'm being facetious with the song. I certainly
don't think we should string anybody up from a tree or leave people
out in the swamp.''
   During a recent interview at his ranch, Daniels expressed some
of the same frustration voiced in the song.
   ``This country is inundated with violent crime and we're not
dealing with it,'' Daniels said. ``Most things are a lot simpler
than people want them to be. If you got a fire, you put it out.''

   World chess champion Garri Kasparov on Monday
condemned the storming of his native city of Baku by Soviet troops,
saying too much force was used and it came too late to save the
Armenians.
   Kasparov, who is of Armenian and Jewish descent and once wrote
that his roots were in Moslem capital of Azerbaijan, volunteered to
mediate the ethnic dispute, which he said could spread and lead to
a ``bloodbath'' across the Soviet Union.
   At a Moscow news conference marked by an even-handedness seldom
seen in the two-year Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, Kasparov said
there were plenty of Interior Ministry troops and police in Baku
before Saturday's attack. Yet they took no armed action against the
roving squads who reportedly killed at least 67 Armenians and
ravaged 1,200 apartments in a six-day campaign of terror.
   Instead of halting the murderers, officials evacuated the
Armenians, and Kasparov contended virtually all had left by the
time Soviet troops attacked on Saturday.
   ``That is why I cannot accept the official explanation'' that
the troops attacked Baku to stop the ethnic violence, he said.
   Kasparov said he thought the attack was meant to crush the
pro-independence movement in Azerbaijan and warn similar groups in
other republics.
   ``I fear that what is now happening in Azerbaijan may lead to a
terrible bloodbath in the whole country,'' said Kasparov, 26. He
added that he fears angry Azerbaijanis could turn on the 100,000
Russian residents of Baku, expanding the ethnic conflict.
   ``If clashes are provoked between Russians and Azerbaijanis, and
if there are victims or refugees among the Russian population, just
think what might happen if they show up in Moscow,'' he said.
   Baku, like many Soviet cities, is home to a variety of ethnic
groups. In his autobiography ``Child of Change,'' Kasparov wrote
about his boyhood experiences in the Azerbaijani capital. ``My
roots are in Baku. That knowledge gives me strength when I go off
to conquer other worlds and gives me solace when I return.''
   Kasparov spends most of his time now in Moscow, where he has a
Russian wife.
   At least 167 people have been killed since the wave of violence
began 10 days ago, including 95 since Soviet troops poured into the
city Saturday morning and were met by firebombs and machine-gun
fire. Azerbaijanis estimate the death toll is far higher, and
Kasparov put it at 500 to 600.
   Kasparov, who rescued 60 of his friends and relatives Wednesday
night, said the government has shown it is either unwilling or
unable to solve the Armenia-Azerbaijan dispute and called for
individuals to begin direct negotiations between the neighboring
republics. He offered to act as a mediator.
   He declined to lay blame exclusively on President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev during the news conference. But in an interview with the
Spanish newspaper El Pais, he said the violence was cultivated by
conservatives to undermine Gorbachev, and he blamed the Soviet
leader for not taking decisive action.
   Kasparov, who became the youngest world chess champion in
November 1985 and earlier this month became the highest rated
player in history, has spoken out frequently on domestic problems
in the Soviet Union.
   He said he used his own money to charter a plane _ virtually
impossible in the Soviet Union _ with the help of the Chess Union.
He managed to get his refugees past Azerbaijani mobs to the Baku
airport on a back road, and 40 of them are staying with him in
Moscow.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Kasparov's
wife, Maria, said the passengers included two of his mother's
brothers, other relatives, several of his chess friends and eight
to 10 strangers who happened to be at the Baku airport.
   Azerbaijani friends helped his group escape, Kasparov said, and
he expressed sympathy for innocent Azerbaijanis killed when the
troops attacked.
   Kasparov also blamed the troops themselves for arming both the
Armenian and Azerbaijani extremists.
   Tass reported that militants obtained helicopters, tanks and
even ground-to-ground missiles. Armenian activists carried one of
their fallen leaders to his grave Sunday in an armored personnel
carrier.
   ``My impression is the population of Baku would have favored a
radical and strong-handed curtailment of the repressions'' against
the Armenian population, he said. ``Nonetheless, the pogroms and
repressions went on in full view and silent consent of the militia
and interior troops.''
   Kasparov also criticized authorities for ignoring the
``explosive'' problem of 160,000 homeless and jobless Azerbaijani
refugees from Armenia, who have been waiting in Baku for
resettlement for as long as two years.
   He specifically blamed the killings on the desperation of the
refugees, who terorized the Armenian population of Baku to grab
their apartments when they fled. A program to find them jobs and
apartments failed in August, 1988, he said.
   ``You do not have to be a politician or a particularly
far-sighted person to see the political danger that lies in
homeless people who have nothing to look forward to,'' he said.
   ``I lost two relatives in Baku, so I have serious reasons to cry
and to shout, he said. ``But I don't think it will help. I don't
want to see another 100,000 killed. It's suicide to continue.''
   ``No matter what happens, the two republics will forever border
one another. No matter how long the war may last, sooner or later
they will have to start negotiations for peace,'' he said.
   He suggested that Armenians abroad, especially in the United
States and France, should work with Moslem groups in Saudi Arabia
and Turkey, ``which must naturally be interested in a peaceful
solution to this conflict.''

   A congresswoman says she hopes a meeting she
set up today between the International Longshoremen's Association
and management would cool tempers in the three-day walkout that has
disrupted the Port of Baltimore.
   Rep. Helen Delich Bentley, R-Md., who has been acting as a
mediator, said the two sides would meet this afternoon in New York.
She said the meeting is not expected to end the strike but may
create a better atmosphere that will help bring about a resolution
later.
   A union official says the governor may be to blame for the
strike.
   The walkout has already caused at least a dozen Baltimore-bound
ships to use other ports during the weekend, port officials said.
   A management proposal to cut the jobs of about 150 clerks, also
known as checkers, led to the strike.
   National ILA president John Bowers canceled a contract vote
scheduled for Friday after Local 953 president Richard P. Hughes
complained about the job cuts.
   After management refused the terms Bowers had set for resolution
through arbitration, Bowers ordered dockworkers not to report for
work, beginning at midnight Friday.
   Hughes has suggested that the threat of a state takeover of the
terminals now run by private companies is what drove management to
demand deep cuts in the clerical jobs filled by Local 953's 430
members.
   Hughes has submitted a sweeping request for notes, documents or
other records of all conversations or meetings Gov. William D.
Schaefer may have had in the last two years concerning labor issues
in the port.
   ``We want to find out as much as we can under the Freedom of
Information Act,'' Hughes said. ``We want to know who our friends
are, who are enemies. We want to find out if the state acted in
good faith.''
   ``The governor's at fault for this entire situation,'' said Rich
Krueger Jr., a member of Local 953 and a delegate to the Baltimore
District Council, an assembly of top International Longshoremen's
Association officials in Baltimore.
   Schaefer prompted the work action by putting pressure on the
Steamship Trade Association, the management negotiating group, and
threatening to put them out of business by taking over some or all
of the port operations, Krueger said. Schaefer has said he is
making such threats because the labor problems at the port are so
disruptive.
   Maryland Transportation Secretary Richard H. Trainor said the
governor bears no responsibility for the stoppage. The blame, he
said, lies with Local 953's leaders. ``I don't know where else
you're going to put it,'' Trainor said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor-strongman Arnold Schwarzenegger came to
the White House on Monday and emerged in a new role: chairman of
the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.
   The broad-shouldered Austrian-born performer, after getting
marching orders from President Bush in the Oval Office, said his
aim is to get all Americans, from the very young to the very old,
to exercise regularly.
   ``President Bush is very much committed not only to have this a
kinder and gentler nation, but also a very fit nation,'' said
Schwarzenegger.
   The onetime Mr. Universe said of the 65-year-old president:
``He's 100 percent behind physical fitness. ... He's in tremendous
shape himself.''
   Bush said in a statement that ``I have asked Arnold to chair the
council because I believe he is uniquely qualified to address and
influence national health and fitness issues, especially among our
youth.''
   Schwarzenegger, 42, who parlayed his body-building skills into a
Hollywood career, has starred in such films as ``The Terminator''
and ``Conan the Barbarian.'' He made numerous appearances for Bush
in 1988 at campaign rallies, where Bush delighted in introducing
him as ``Conan the Republican.''
   Schwarzenegger promised, ``I will give this charge by the
president the fullest dimension of energy and commitment. Fitness
for the '90s is what we will emblazon on our banner and we will
wave this banner very high.''
   He said Bush ``believes in physical fitness for the young, for
the adults and also for the senior citizens. He stressed that he
really wants to cover the whole thing, the whole range.
   ``He believes and I believe that everyone in the United States
has the right to be physically fit,'' said Schwarzenegger.
   The actor said his first objective will be ``to get physical
education classes back into schools.'' Illinois is the only state
where phys ed is a daily requirement, he said.

<TEXT>
   A prefabricated company town that
arrived on flatbed trucks 23 years ago is leaving the same way, Ray
Huseby says.
   Huseby bought the fire hall, the community center and 22 houses
in Taconite Harbor as an investment, and plans to sell the
buildings, which cost $210 to $4,000, as homes once he decides
where to put them.
   ``He moves houses like other people move cars,'' said his
daughter Cindy Lubich, who is in on the deal.
   The ghost town, a relic from the booming 1950s that had become a
headache for LTV Steel Mining Co., will be moved away house by
house on Huseby's rig. He has until July 1 to finish.
   LTV Steel inherited the town from Erie Mining Co. in 1987 and is
happy to be rid of it after local laws stopped it from literally
giving away the homes.
   Huseby and Lubich plan to fix up and resell most of their
holdings, which have been appraised at $11,000 to $15,000.
Taconite's two other houses were sold to other bidders.
   Huseby says how much he invests in the 15-ton buildings depends
on how much money they will command, whether he buys lots and
builds foundations and where they end up.
   Toivo Maki, superintendent of operations at LTV Steel, said in
in a large city such as Minneapolis-St. Paul the bungalows might
fetch $60,000 apiece.
   Dead towns are nothing new in hard-pressed northeastern
Minnesota. Erected in 1957 by Eire Mining 50 miles south of Canada
on the shores of Lake Superior, the town wasn't incorporated and
never had its own mailing address or school.
   Taconite Harbor was on the map, but not on the census rolls.
   ``It was never a town, exactly,'' said Maki. ``I'm not sure what
it was.''
   A line of houses facing each other on a street squeezed between
the highway and the lake, the town was built to house the workers
needed to run the docks that handled the taconite pellets bound for
the steel mills. It was a cog in the system that fed the nation's
appetite for automobiles from Detroit.
   For $400 down and $110 a month, a couple could buy its first
house from the company and start a family in a three- or
four-bedroom bungalow. Company docks and the now-defunct power
plant were a few hundred yards away.
   Later, the auto and steel industries sagged and the demand for
taconite, a low-grade iron ore, plummeted. Today, only a few
workers are needed to work the dock; the last family left Taconite
Harbor about 19 months ago.

   Moslem militants defied curfews Monday
and fought soldiers for a second day in an outburst of secessionist
violence police say has killed 48 people and injured 400.
   Trouble began late Saturday when Moslems protested a police
crackdown. Moslem militants want to secede from predominantly Hindu
India and either make Kashmir independent or unite the northwestern
state with adjacent Pakistan, an Islamic nation.
   Only a brief lull during heavy rain Sunday has interrupted the
violence. Police said militants and two policemen were killed
Monday in Srinagar and four protesters were shot to death in
neighboring Anantnag.
   ``The whole city is up in revolt,'' said Mohammad Nomani,
inspector-general of police in Srinagar. He estimated the number of
protesters at 1,500 and said they had at least 1,000 automatic
rifles and other weapons.
   A senior official in Srinagar said privately the local
authorities had asked for more troops ``to back up the security
forces.'' Hundreds of soldiers have been sent to Srinagar, a city
of 1 million that is the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state on
the Pakistan border.
   At least 38 people, most of them protesters, were killed late
Saturday night and Sunday. Police said troopers opened fire on
curfew violators in at least six places Monday.
   Doctors at the Soora Medical Institute said at least 300 people
were wounded Monday when soldiers fired on a group of about 5,000.
``Most of them had injuries in the upper part of the body,'' one
doctor said, asking that his name not be used.
   Other doctors said all beds in the hospital were occupied and
the cafeteria was converted to provide more space. Thousands of
Moslems, defying the curfew, camped inside the hospital to donate
blood.
   Troops with shoot-on-sight orders patrolled streets in Srinigar.
The roa of army trucks and wailing of ambulance sirens could be
heard through the city.
   A near-mutiny of part of the state police force, which Moslems
dominate, occurred after a member was killed by gunfire from other
security forces.
   About 500 armed policemen stayed inside a police complex Monday,
refusing to join the crackdown, but an officer said they were
``pacified some hours later.''
   Mohammad Aslam, a state policeman, said the dead comrade was hit
by army fire and soldiers refused to deliver his body.
   The officer of state police, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, confirmed the death and said the matter ``has apparently
been sorted out.''
   An around-the-clock curfew applies in Srinigar. Only soldiers
and military vehicles are permitted on the streets.
   Bands of 50 to 100 men formed throughout the day, however.
Teen-age boys shredded an Indian flag in front of soldiers while
people in a crowd screamed: ``You Indians go back!''
   Heavily armed soldiers guarded government buildings and bridges
over streams feeding Dal Lake, once a major tourist attraction.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority.
Moslem followers of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front have
attacked government buildings and patrols in their quest for
independence or union with Pakistan.
   Attacks increased after five jailed militants were freed last
month in exchange for the the kidnapped daughter of a Cabinet
minister.
   The old princely state of Kashmir was divided between India and
Pakistan when the subcontinent was partitioned in 1947 and became
independent of Britain. They do not agree on the border and have
fought three wars, the last in 1971.
   Pakistan controls the western part of Kashmir and the eastern
section was incorporated into Jammu-Kashmir.
   About 64 percent of the Jammu-Kashmir's 5 million people are
Moslems, who make up only 12 percent of the Indian population of
880 million.

<HEAD>Diaphragms Should Be Promoted To Stop Heterosexual AIDS Spread</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health officials trying to block the
heterosexual spread of AIDS should promote research on the use of
diaphragms, which could be as effective as condoms and are likely
to be more widely used, a researcher says.
   Zena Stein, an epidemiologist at Columbia University in New
York, said Sunday that diaphragms can prevent the spread of other
sexually transmitted diseases and have important advantages over
condoms, which are now the most widely promoted means of preventing
the spread of AIDS.
   The use of diaphragms and anti-viral creams or gels ``could and
should be promoted among women,'' Stein said at the New York-Italy
Medical Symposium. ``It's not going to do everything, but it will
do something.''
   Stein said studies of gonorrhea and family planning programs
suggest that research on diaphragms as an AIDS preventive is
warranted.
   For example, she said, diaphragms and spermicides are as
effective as condoms in preventing the spread of gonorrhea and
might, therefore, be as effective in preventing the spread of the
AIDS virus. Research is needed to settle that question.
   ``We need a research program that tests these barriers we
have,'' she said. The so-called ``barrier'' contraceptives include
the diaphragm, the contraceptive sponge and the ``pouch,'' a female
condom.
   Research should also be done to determine which spermicide best
kills the AIDS virus, and whether it should be provided as a cream,
foam or gel, Stein said. ``We don't know what women want and what
they'll use,'' she said.
   Stein said that while condoms can prevent the spread of AIDS,
they are not used nearly as often as they should be. Most
heterosexual transmission occurs from men to women, she said, and
therefore it is women, not men, who have the incentive to use
condoms.
   ``Women can offer them, can urge the man to use them, can
persuade, but it's up to the man. We know that that's often not
acceptable,'' Stein said.
   In practice, condoms are not being widely used, she said.
``Compliance is very far from 100 percent. Very far from where we
want it.''

<HEAD>Rural Poor Still Suffer Months After Hurricane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The forgotten victims of Hurricane Hugo are
still struggling to survive in roofless trailers along gravel back
roads in coastal Williamsburg County, or in modest cinderblock
homes on the outskirts of tobacco towns.
   Life for hundreds _ some say thousands _ of South Carolina's
rural poor is not much better than the day after the killer
hurricane struck.
   The storm, which crashed ashore last Sept. 21 at Charleston,
claimed 29 lives and caused an estimated $5.9 billion damage when
it cut a swath hundreds of miles wide through the state. After
Hugo, 24 of the state's 46 counties were declared federal disaster
areas.
   While relief immediately flowed to coastal areas, counties
dozens of miles inland _ many of them rural and populated by poor
blacks _ were ignored in some cases.
   Four months after the hurricane, there are few offers of help,
even though workers and building supplies are still needed, said
Edna Hampton, the Hugo outreach coordinator for Williamsburg County.
   Officials estimate as many as 4,000 structures were destroyed or
heavily damaged in that county, one of the poorest in the state.
   ``Before the storm came, some of the homes were half liveable,''
she said. ``Now they're not liveable. People are a little bit
discouraged. We feel forgotten in a sense.''
   She has been trying to locate people who may not have applied
for disaster assistance yet. Illiteracy, lack of communication and
transportation and suspicion of government have kept many rural
residents from seeking aid, she said.
   In her small cinderblock house on the outskirts of Kingstree,
Audrey Epps fights back tears as she remembers how the storm
smashed the windows and tore the roof off her home. Ms. Epps and
her 78-year-old invalid mother, Zeal, had to seek shelter in the
only room of the five-room house that didn't leak. She lost
clothing and other personal effects.
   Ms. Epps lost her job because the pharmaceutical company where
she worked third shift was shut down by storm damage. She can't
find another third-shift job and can't afford to pay someone to
look after her mother during the day. When she worked nights, a
relative stayed with her mother.
   ``The only thing I can do is stay here and take care of her,''
Ms. Epps said.
   Nor does she have the funds to adequately repair and refurnish
her home. She received $2,750 from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, but supplies to fix the roof alone came to $1,800. The
ceilings and walls are waterlogged and still need repair. Plastic
sheeting covers broken windows, keeping in heat from a wood-burning
stove.
   ``I didn't want a beautiful home. I only wanted a house I could
live in,'' Ms. Epps said recently.
   ``I thought once I would snap, I still think I might,'' Ms. Epps
said, sobbing.
   A few miles south, down a gravel road near the community of
Lane, George Bradshaw and his two mentally handicapped sons live in
a trailer roofed by a plastic tarp, without electricity, drawing
water from a pump up the road.
   ``We've been here ever since the storm,'' said Bradshaw, who is
retired.
   Bradshaw's insurance company settled by paying off the mortgage
on the trailer, leaving the family with only a few hundred dollars,
not enough to make repairs.
   A handful of out-of-state volunteers are at work in the county,
such as John Nienhuis, who arrived with a group from the Christian
Reformed Church of Grand Rapids, Mich.
   He said workers many times are trying to repair homes that
really should be leveled and rebuilt from scratch. ``We're putting
so many good hours into jobs and when they're done, they're (homes)
not worth 5 cents,'' he said.
   Recovery from the storm won't be measured by how well the
state's beaches are restored or how many tourists return, but by
how all of the state's people recover, says J.T. McLawhorn Jr.,
president of the Columbia Urban League.
   ``We, individually and collectively, are going to be held
responsible for this recovery,'' he said.

   Israeli forces on Monday tracked and shot to
death two Palestinian guerrillas who killed an army colonel while
trying to infiltrate Israel from southern Lebanon, army officials
said.
   The body of a third guerrilla was found Sunday, when the
confrontation began.
   In the southern Lebanese port city of Sidon, the radical Abu
Nidal Palestinian group claimed responsibility for the border
attack.
   Abu Nidal's group, Fatah-Revolutionary Council, said the
guerrilla squad was retaliating for Israeli air raids Friday on
Palestinian bases and positions of the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
Hezbollah, or Party of God. Seven people were killed and 18 wounded
in those attacks.
   Brig. Gen. Zeev Zaharin, who is in charge of Israel's ties with
the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia, praised the
militiamen and Israeli troops for ``stopping the killers who tried
to attack our citizens from the other side of the border.''
   ``The only reason for a Palestinian group to reach the border is
to attack Israeli settlements,'' Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, chief of
the army's northern command, said on Israel Television.
   The statements came shortly after Salah Khalaf, a top aide to
PLO leader Yasser Arafat, declared the Middle East peace process
deadlocked and called for military operations against Israel
outside the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Khalaf, second in command in Arafat's mainstream Fatah branch of
the PLO, said in Kuwait that ``the PLO now has no alternative but
to escalate armed struggle'' to support the Palestinian uprising in
the territories.
   The fighting began Sunday after Col. Yitzhak Rahimov led a unit
of the Israeli-trained South Lebanon Army to Yaroun when a villager
reported seeing three guerrillas in olive-colored uniforms, Israel
radio said.
   Yaroun is about a mile north of Israel's border and two miles
north of Avivim, an Israeli frontier communual farm.
   The guerrillas were armed with grenade launchers and
Soviet-designed assault rifles, the radio said, and had barricaded
themselves in a house on the edge of Yaroun.
   As the militiamen surrounded the house, the guerrillas opened
fire and hurled grenades, the radio said.
   It said South Lebanon Army fighters called in tanks, and
Rahimov, 39, was killed by gunfire as he approached one of the
vehicles, the radio said.
   Israel's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, said the body of
one guerrilla was found in the house. He said it was uncertain
whether he was killed by Israeli troops or by cover fire from his
squad members.
   Soldiers backed by tanks searched overnight for two other
guerrillas who were believed to have fled the house, the army said.
   ``A chase has been going on since the early morning hours, and
in the end they were discovered and in a short battle they were
eliminated,'' Shomron said on Israel's army radio.
   Army officials said both guerrillas were killed within a mile of
the house.
   Rahimov was the highest-ranking Israeli officer to be killed in
southern Lebanon since the army withdrew the bulk of its troops in
June 1985, ending a three-year occupation.
   The clashes occurred in Israel's self-declared security zone, a
2{- to 12-mile-wide strip the Israeli's view as a buffer against
attacks by Palestinian and Shiite Moslem guerrillas.
   Israeli troops and about 3,000 militiamen from the predominantly
Christian South Lebanon Army patrol the zone.
   Last year, two Israeli soldiers and 12 militiamen were killed in
clashes in the zone; 75 guerrillas were killed and 12 captured.

   A leading advocate for the homeless said
Monday that he will urge those who live on the streets not to
cooperate with an upcoming census.
   ``You can't count all the people in the streets,'' said Mitch
Snyder of Washington's Community for Creative Non-Violence.
``Experience quickly teaches the homeless that to be identified as
such is to risk harassment ... and abuse.''
   David Hayden of the Justice House Community, a shelter in
Roanoke, Va., said he, too, would decline to cooperate.
   ``The key to survival for homeless people is invisibility,''
Hayden said. ``If you are a homeless woman with children you deny
being homeless because you don't want to lose the children.''
   Peter A. Bounpane, assistant census director, said he hoped the
agency could persuade Snyder and other homeless advocates to change
their minds.
   Major federal programs are targeted and funds distributed based
on census figures.
   Snyder contends that both the Reagan and Bush administrations
have sought to minimize the problem of homelessness and that,
because many homeless would be missed, the census results will lead
to less money and attention for the needy.
   ``If we were dealing with an honest government and an honest
administration, we would cooperate,'' Snyder said.
   Homelessness has received increasing attention in recent years,
but no accurate figures of the number of people affected are
available.
   The National Alliance to End Homelessness, a private research
and assistance group, estimates that as many as 2 million people
are homeless for at least a portion of the year and that the number
has been growing. The Partnership for the Homeless in New York
issued a similar estimate after a national survey of 46 cities.
   However, a 1984 study by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development estimated the number of homeless at 250,000 to 350,000;
a Harvard study put the total at 350,000 in 1986; and an Urban
Institute report in 1988 estimated the total at about 600,000.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has estimated the total at 3
million.
   The Census Bureau plans a special count of the homeless March
20, about 10 days before the survey of the rest of the nation.
Census takers across the country will spend the night visiting
shelters, flophouses, hospitals, missions and counting people on
the streets.
   Advocates for the homeless, as well as the homeless themselves,
are being recruited to participate.
   Snyder burned census envelopes that had been used to send him
materials concerning the effort. He said, however, that other
groups are cooperating and that opinion is divided in the National
Coalition for the Homeless.
   Some cities have made special efforts to get their homeless
counted. New York, for example, compiled an extensive list of
places where homeless people spend their nights to guide the census
takers.

   Mayor Marion Barry, facing a misdemeanor
cocaine possession charge, left the nation's capital today to check
into a residential treatment facility in Florida, a city official
said.
   ``At this point the mayor is not considering resignation,'' City
Administrator Carol Thompson told a news conference. ``There will
be no management vacuum'' in the mayor's absence.
   Barry, who has turned over the daily control of the local
government to Ms. Thompson, did not speak to reporters before
leaving his home.
   ``The mayor has left the city ... he has left for treatment,''
said Ms. Thompson.
   She said it was ``not appropriate'' for her to disclose details
of the mayor's treatment. She said Barry would be doing that.
   However, a top politial aide to the mayor said Barry left for
the Hanley-Hazelden Treatment Center in West Palm Beach, Fla.
Clinic spokeswoman Patricia McRae said confidentiality rules forbid
the clinic from revealing the names of patients.
   Meanwhile, NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks questioned
whether Barry's arrest was part of a pattern of harassment of
elected black officials and ``the rising tide of racism in this
nation.''
   ``I'm not trying to justify any wrongdoing'' or condone use of
cocaine, but ``I am opposed to selective enforcement of the law,''
the civil rights leader told reporters after meeting with President
Bush about recent racial bombings in the South.
   Barry, his political career in shambles following his drug
arrest, said in an emotional 15-minute speech Sunday he will take
steps ``to heal my body, mind and soul.''
   Barry offered no clue during his speech as to what kind of
assistance he is seeking, except to say that social activist and
self-described nutrition expert Dick Gregory was helping him
explore his options.
   The Washington Post today quoted unnamed sources as saying that
while Barry had initially decided to seek treatment at the Betty
Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage, Calif., he was leaning toward an
alternative program with Gregory.
   The Post also said some of Barry's longtime political allies are
beginning behind-the-scenes moves to shift their allegiance to
Jesse Jackson rather than lose their own influence in city
government if Barry's political career is over.
   The Washington Times, meanwhile, said an agreement was reached
Friday for Barry to throw his support to Jackson in this fall's
mayoral election.
   ``You are going to see politicians, preachers, businessmen come
out in public in the next few days, if not weeks, calling for
Jackson to get off the fence for the good of this city,'' the Times
quoted an unidentified source as saying.
   A Jackson spokesman, Eric Easter, told the newspaper, however:
``That kind of discussion is inappropriate at this time. His
(Jackson's) concern right now is very personal, for the mayor, his
family and the city. Our focus continues to be statehood for the
city.''
   Barry said Sunday that the events of the past several days had
been ``more difficult than fighting my way out of poverty'' or
struggling in the civil rights movement, because ``I spent so much
time doing for others that I have not worried enough about ...
caring for myself.''
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens has hinted in interviews that he
might look favorably on a resignation by Barry when deciding
whether to pursue other phases in an ongoing probe of the mayor's
activities.
   After refusing to comment directly on whether Barry's
resignation would lead to a dismissal of the misdemeanor charge
against the mayor, Stephens said: ``I'm very sensitive to the
concerns of this community, to the people in this community and the
need to have an effective government in place...''
   ``There are a broad range of considerations as United States
attorney that I would consider beyond the simple issue of holding
Mr. Barry accountable for his criminal conduct,'' Stephens said.
   However, the prosecutor said on NBC's ``Today'' show this
morning, ``In a system that requires fairness, I think it is
appropriate that we go forward with the charge that has been lodged
here.''
   While Barry did not say in his Sunday speech that he is
suffering from drug or alcohol abuse, others indicated he was.
   Herbert O. Reid Sr., one of the mayor's closest personal
advisers, said he hoped that from Barry's travails ``we can all
learn something about drug addiction.''
   ``The most serious problem is alcoholism,'' Barry spokeswoman
Lurma Rackley said. ``The mayor has acknowledged that he has a
health concern, and the details are his private matter.''
   The mayor's wife, Effi, said in remarks that followed her
husband's, ``For you to admit that you have a problem ... that you
need to make yourself whole again is truly a burden lifted from our
souls. For our family it is just the beginning.''
   Barry, surrounded by clergy in a broadcast appearance in St.
Timothy's Episcopal Church near his home, clasped his wife's hand
and said he has come ``face to face with my deepest human
failures.''
   Barry said, ``these ministers have helped me to keep the
strength I need ... I'm going to find a way to heal my body, mind
and soul.''
   Barry, 53, faces a cocaine possession charge after testing
positive for cocaine in blood and urine tests administered
following his arrest.
   Barry had been poised to announce his bid for a fourth term as
mayor on Sunday.

<HEAD>ANC Searches For New Approaches to Counter Government Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reforms by the South African government
and upheaval in Eastern Europe have caught the exiled African
National Congress groping for new strategies to wage a political
rather than military struggle.
   The ANC, the main guerrilla movement fighting white rule in
South Africa, recently held a policy review conference in Lusaka
but announced no new proposals to counter reforms by President F.W.
de Klerk that have eased pressure on his government.
   The ANC continues to focus on hard-line strategies such as its
largely ineffectual bombing campaign and efforts to increase
sanctions against South Africa. But these policies are generating
little enthusiasm at a time when de Klerk has been advocating
negotiations with blacks and raising the possibility that he might
lift the 30-year ban on the ANC.
   ``Looking at our situation realistically, we must admit that we
do not have the capacity within our country to intensify the
(armed) struggle in any meaningful way,'' said ANC
secretary-general Alfred Nzo.
   He urged the guerrilla group not to ``trail behind events with
our feet shackled by old perceptions and a fear to confront a new
reality.''
   The ANC's support among millions of black South Africans is
probably as strong as its been in its 78-year history, including
the last three decades in exile. Most observers believe the ANC
would win elections if South Africa's 28 million blacks were
allowed to vote.
   The group also has good relations with most leading powers in
the East and West, and solid backing from black African states.
   However, the ANC must readjust to changes in Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union, traditionally their biggest backers and main
weapons suppliers but now moving away from active involvement in
far-away conflicts.
   South African academic Philip Nel, a Soviet expert, said
officials in Moscow have conveyed to the ANC the Soviets would
maintain support for the movement ``only on condition that the ANC
commit itself clearly to a political program which could lead to a
negotiated stabilization in South Africa.''
   The ANC conference highlighted generational and tactical
differences among its members and uncertainty about how to approach
potential negotiations after so many years of rejecting all
proposals by the government.
   Many senior ANC leaders are in their 60s and 70s, and its
president, Oliver Tambo, 71, is recovering from a stroke. Members
of the older generation are reserved in demeanor, wear suits at
public events, stress the importance of dialogue and stress that
the armed struggle came about only as a last resort after the ANC
was outlawed in 1960.
   Most of the 1,000 rank-and-file members at the conference were
in their 20s, 30s and early 40s, and belong to a generation of
``young lions'' whose political education came during times of
frequent street clashes between activists and police in South
Africa.
   They wear jeans and T-shirts with anti-apartheid slogans, give
clenched-fist salutes and are quick to burst into militant freedom
songs.
   Steve Tshwete, a high-ranking ANC member in his 40s, said, ``We
must continue to intensify the struggle. We are fighting for
liberation. It is a war that's going on. It's not a game of
cricket.''
   But in South Africa, the battle is being fought less with bombs
and more along traditional political lines.
   Sisulu and five other ANC leaders freed last year after more
than 25 years in prison campaign freely on behalf of the
organization in South Africa, although it remains outlawed.
   The South African government says it is reviewing the status of
banned organizations, including the ANC, which authorities
previously depicted as a communist-led terrorist group.
   De Klerk also has eased the government's long-standing
requirement that the ANC renounce violence before it can
participate in negotiations. He now says the group need only commit
itself to ``peaceful solutions.''
   The ANC is demanding de Klerk legalize the movement and
institute other reforms before they enter negotiations. But they
have been caught off-guard by several of de Klerk's announcements,
sometimes taking days to respond.
   The ANC says it has no plans to announce major policy or
leadership changes until another conference in June.
   By that time Nelson Mandela, the ANC's best known leader, is
widely expected to be out of prison. Mandela, along with Sisulu and
other recently freed colleagues, should give the organization a
high-profile, authoritative voice inside the country.
   The government considers the older ANC leaders more moderate and
would prefer to negotiate with them rather than the ``young lions.''
   Should the two sides end up at the same conference table, there
appears to be little chance of a quick breakthrough.
   The ANC seeks a one-person, one-vote democracy, which de Klerk
opposes, saying it will lead to black domination of the nation's 5
million whites. He envisions power-sharing with blacks, but with
whites having some sort of veto power on major policy issues.

<HEAD>Mofford Decision Throws Race Open</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford's decision not to
run for office this fall, announced after weeks of conflicting
signals, has thrown Arizona politics and government for a loop.
   Mrs. Mofford said she had ``no idea'' who might run in her place
and would not say who she favored.
   But with four Republicans, including impeached Gov. Evan Mecham,
already in the race and control of the statehouse during a
redistricting year at stake, the names of a half-dozen Democrats
were being mentioned as possible candidates before Mrs. Mofford had
finished speaking Thursday.
   Mrs. Mofford, who is recovering from gallbladder surgery, said
health was not a factor in her decision and that she intended to be
``a full-time governor'' for the remainder of the term to which she
was elevated in 1988, from secretary of state, when Mecham was
ousted.
   Lawmakers and lobbyists said it wasn't clear if Mrs. Mofford's
agenda would suffer because she was now a lame duck or would
prosper because the Republican-controlled Legislature no longer
would worry that adopting her program might help her campaign.
   House Speaker Jane Hull, a Republican, said she thought Mrs.
Mofford's announcement would allow her to ``hold the politicking
down'' during this year's legislative session.
   But Republican lobbyist Michael Smith said that while Mrs.
Mofford's decision could help her with her program, it also could
mean that ``now no one has to listen to her'' because she is a lame
duck.
   Democratic Rep. Peter Goudinoff, a political science teacher,
took a completely different tack, saying Mrs. Mofford's status
could make her stronger politically by allowing her to veto bills
without worrying about the political consequences.
   The electoral front was equally confused.
   Mrs. Mofford and her aides had sent several signals that she
would, including massive fundraising and a State of the State
message that could have doubled as a campaign platform.
   Thursday's announcement caught potential Democratic candidates
off guard, and three of the likeliest _ Phoenix Mayor Terry
Goddard, former state education czar Carolyn Warner and Chief
Justice Frank Gordon Jr. of the Arizona Supreme Court _ said it
would take time to test the waters. Goddard and Gordon would have
to give up their current posts in order to run for governor.
   Goddard, son of state Democratic Party chairman and former Gov.
Sam Goddard, said he was taking ``a hard look'' at running but that
it might take him three weeks to decide.
   Gordon said Friday that he did not know how much time it would
take him to make a decision.
   Mrs. Warner, an ally of organized labor and the party's
candidate in the 1986 election that Mecham won, said she was
consulting friends and associates and hoped to have a decision
within days or weeks.
   Goddard gets along well with the Republican establishment, is
popular statewide and can raise money quickly if he is perceived as
the likely winner, said Democrat Alan Stephens, the Senate's
minority leader.
   Gordon presided over the Senate trial that resulted in Mecham's
ouster as governor.
   Others mentioned as potential Democratic candidates include
Tempe Mayor Harry Mitchell, grocery magnate Eddie Basha, and former
congressman and Mecham aide Sam Steiger.
   Republican candidates said they believed Mrs. Mofford's
departure and the likelihood of a Democratic primary fight would
alter the whole dynamics of the election and could bring more
candidates into the GOP race as well.
   Mrs. Mofford's decision ``creates a level playing field,'' said
developer J. Fife Symington, a GOP establishment candidate. ``It's
always difficult to run against an incumbent.''
   Mrs. Mofford was criticized for lacking leadership and for a
hands-off approach to government, but she fared well in popularity
polls until recently.
   ``I believe that if she had chosen to run in 1990 she would have
been a formidable candidate,'' Symington said.
   Mecham agreed: ``I don't believe the Democrats will be able to
field anybody that will be more difficult to beat than her.''
   In addition to Symington and Mecham, those who have announced
for the GOP nomination are former Maricopa County supervisor Fred
Koory and maverick school teacher Bob Barnes.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin, another Republican, also has been
approached about running but has not announced his plans and said
that he expected to hold off until the end of the month.
   Mrs. Mofford said she would support whoever wins the Democratic
primary and that the roughly $375,000 that she has collected in
campaign funds will be returned to contributors where possible.

<TEXT>
   N) _ Iranian TV reported Soviet troops
stationed along Iran's border with strife-torn Soviet Azerbaijan on
Monday barred people from crossing into Iran. Tass, however, said
crossings were continuing.
   The Tehran broadcast, monitored in Cyprus, said the guards also
carefully screened anyone wishing to enter from Iran and allowed
through only Soviet Azerbaijanis returning home.
   In Moscow, the official news agency Tass said, ``The situation
remains complicated on the state border. Azerbaijanis and Iranians
continue to cross the border en masse in both directions.''
   Thousands of Soviet Azerbaijanis, who are bound by a common
language, culture and religion with their Iranian kin, had poured
across the 400-mile border into Iran following the outbreak of
violence in their home republic Jan. 13.
   The television reported that 20,000 Soviet Moslems had fled to
Iran since Thursday and that arrangements were being made to house
them.
   Turkey, which has a large ethnic Azerbaijani minority, on Monday
said it wanted an end to the bloodletting in Azerbaijan and has
asked Moscow to allow a medical team to enter the republic to help
the wounded.
   Thousands of Azerbaijani Turks rallied in the eastern town of
Aralik, near the point where the Iranian, Turkish and Soviet
borders converge.
   Official Soviet reports have said more than 160 people have died
since ethnic violence erupted earlier this month between the
republic's predominantly Moslem Azerbaijanis and Christian
Armenians living there.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev blames Moslem fanatics for
the violence. The Soviets have long feared that Iran's
revolutionary zealots who seized power in 1979 would seek to
inflame the 70 million Moslems who live in the Soviet Union's
southern republics.
   Soviet media accused Iran of supplying arms to the Moslems in
Azerbaijan, but Iranian media denied the allegation.
   Nationalists in Soviet Azerbaijan have been agitating for the
establishment of a ``Greater Azerbaijan,'' an independent, oil-rich
homeland for 20 million Azerbaijanis on both sides of the border.
   The top Moslem religious leader of Soviet Azerbaijan, in an
interview published Monday, predicted grave repercussions from the
Soviet military intervention.
   ``This mistaken decision will have dire consequences,''
Sheikh-ul-Islam Allahshukur Pasha-Zade was quoted as saying. The
Kuwaiti daily Al-Anbaa said it conducted the interview by telephone
from Moscow.
   Iranian leaders, fearful that any forceful crushing of the
rebellion in Azerbaijan would escalate the crisis and endanger its
own stability, have cautioned Moscow to use peaceful means to stem
the fighting.
   The Iranian Foreign Ministry Sunday called on the Soviet Union
to halt ``violent clashes'' with Moslems in its Caucasus republics,
and warned that the widening crackdown on the nationalists could
jeopordize Moscow's reformist policies.
   In Monday's interview, Pasha-Zadeh also said Gorbachev was
giving false information about the situation in Azerbaijan.
   ``This prompted him to take a precipitous and costly decision as
the Soviet troops did when they occupied Afghanistan, and when they
intervened in Czechoslovakia in 1968,'' he added.
   But, he went on, ``the imposition of a state of emergency and
the intervention of troops have exacerbated the situation.''
   ``I say it frankly, I am unable to control the sentiments of
angry people outraged over the shedding of blood in Baku's
streets.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki paid homage Monday to Czechoslovakia's drive for freedom
and pressed for closer ties between the two emerging democracies.
   Mazowiecki met with Premier Marian Calfa and later had an
80-minute meeting with President Vaclav Havel. He also conferred
with Parliament Speaker Alexander Dubcek and Roman Catholic primate
Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek.
   ``I come here as the first prime minister to visit a
Czechoslovakia returning itself to the road of full democracy,''
Mazowiecki told Polish and Czechoslovak journalists after his
meeting with Calfa. ``I come ... prepared to discuss all matters
and controversies ... to bring a new quality to our relations.''
   He said he hoped for good and close relations between the ``two
sovereign nations'' of Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   ``I am convinced that such good cooperation could have an
essential effect for the launching of the new Europe at a time when
central-eastern Europe is undergoing such great changes,'' he said.
   Popular citizens movements in both Poland and Czechoslovakia
succeeded in 1989 in breaking the monopoly of power held for four
decades by the Communists. Mazowiecki, a longtime Solidarity
activist, became Eastern Europe's first non-Communist government
leader in August.
   Calfa, a reform Communist who assumed the premiership in
December, resigned from the party this month. Czechoslovakia has
scheduled fully democratic elections for June.
   ``I welcome Prime Minister Mazowiecki as a representative of a
state that supported the democratization process in Czechoslovakia
and openly expressed it,'' Calfa said.
   The visit comes amid intense diplomatic activity between Warsaw
and Prague. Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier visited
Poland Jan. 10-11, and Havel is due to visit Polish President
Wojciech Jaruzelski on Thursday.
   On Mazowieka's agenda Monday were talks on easing border
restrictions for Poles visiting Czechoslovakia, increased
cooperation to reduce air and water pollution along their border,
closer cultural ties, and rights for the Polish minority in
Czechoslovakia.
   There have been recent suggestions of reviving a 50-year-old
proposal to create a Polish-Czechoslovak federation, positioned
between Germany and the Soviet Union, that would be strong enough
not to be dominated by either.
   The proposal, voiced last month by former U.S. National Security
Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, was met with interest by Poles
concerned about a reunified Germany. The response from Czechoslovak
officials, however, has been tepid. Calfa told a Polish newspaper
last week that Czechoslovakia may want ``closer cooperation. ...
But now we are not ready, due to economic reasons, to establish any
formal unions or confederations.''
   Mazowiecki's day in Czechoslovakia began with a trip to the
grave of student Jan Palach, who immolated himself 21 years ago to
protest the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion that restored hard-line
Communist rule.
   It was the first time a government leader had gone to the grave
during a state visit.
   ``It is not an accident that I begin my trip at the grave of Jan
Palach,'' Mazowiecki said at the small village cemetery in Vsetaty,
about 15 miles north of Prague.
   ``His sacrifice has remained in our minds all these years, this
tragic sacrifice. This is why, when things are better now, we
should return our thoughts to those who could not see these days.
...
   ``This is why when I come to a free and democratic
Czechoslovakia, I start in this place.''
   Side by side, Mazowiecki and Calfa bowed their heads and lighted
candles as a small crowd watched in the birch-shaded graveyard
nestled on a hillside looking out over rolling farmland.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo said Monday his
governing party and two moderate opposition groups will create a
new party, a serious setback for the nation's most radical leaders.
   ``We agreed to establish a new political order based on
political stability and create a new popular party of moderate
democratic forces to meet the needs of the times,'' Roh said in a
televised address after a 10-hour meeting with opposition leaders
Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil.
   The alignment boosted the chances of Kim Young-sam coming to
power after Roh steps down in Feburary 1993 at the end of a single
five-year term.
   The two were bitter rivals in the presidential elections in
December 1987, and Kim Young-sam accused Roh of vote fraud.
   The new party will be assured of a two-thirds majority in the
299-member National Assembly. It also will dwarf the largest
opposition group, Party for Peace and Democracy, and limit its
chances of coming to power.
   The party's charismatic leader, Kim Dae-jung, denounced the
alliance as a power grab, and radical students called it an attempt
to prolong what they view as a pro-U.S. military dictatorship.
   Students battled riot police with firebombs and rocks at five
universities in Seoul and two other cities, and police arrested
hundreds of demonstrators.
   Roh said the new party, tentatively named the Democratic Liberal
Party, will be inaugurated within six months. Until then, Roh said
he and Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil will lead a working committee.
   He said Korea needed a new political order ``to overcome an
economic crisis and effectively solve pending problems facing the
nation.''
   It will be the first time in Korea's history that a new
political party is formed by ruling and opposition parties.
   Kim Youn-sam said the three leaders talked about changing the
country's current presidential government system to a Cabinet
structure.
   Roh and Kim did not elaborate, however, apparently in order to
avoid friction with Kim Dae-jung.
   Kim Dae-jung called the new party a ``a political coup d'etat
aimed at holding onto power.'' He said new elections should be held
as a referendum on the issue.
   Governing party officials rejected the criticism, saying the
opposition leader had been asked to form an alliance.
   Party officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
new party will adopt a collective leadership, with Roh serving as a
ceremonial head and Kim Young-sam likely to be selected chairman.
   Kim Jong-pil, who once served as prime minister under the
assassinated autocratic president, Park Chung-hee, called the
change ``revolutionary'' and said he hoped other political
``heavyweights'' would join the alliance.
   Roh defeated the three Kims by a narrow margin in the 1987
presidential election, the first democratic balloting in 16 years.
Many Koreans blamed Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung for losing the
presidential election by splitting the opposition vote.

   U.S.-Soviet arms talks resumed Monday and
negotiators expressed confidence they could meet the Malta summit
goal of completing a treaty on long-range nuclear weapons this year.
   Round 13 of the 5-year-old negotiations on strategic nuclear
arms and space weapons began with a meeting of delegation chiefs
Richard Burt of the United States and Yuri Nazarkin of the Soviet
Union.
   A joint statement said both hope ``it will be possible during
this round to make substantial progress on those issues where
differences remain.''
   Burt and Nazarkin signed an agreement allowing trial inspections
of each other's nuclear warheads, with the goal of finding ways to
make sure the number of warheads on each missile does not exceed
the limit.
   ``It's a good way to start,'' Burt said after the 35-minute
meeting.
   Nazarkin nodded and noted the inspection agreement was the
fourth ``trial measure'' agreed upon by the negotiators. The three
others covered notification of maneuvers, procedures to identify
bombers carrying air-launched cruise missiles and reciprocal
demonstration of missile identification techniques.
   The treaty resulting from the negotiations, called START, is
intended to reduce the number of long-range missiles on each side
by 30 to 50 percent. Negotiators have agreed on limits of 1,600
delivery vehicles _ missiles and bombers _ and 6,000 nuclear
warheads.
   Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed at the Malta
summit in December that all major outstanding issues should be
resolved by their next meeting in June and a START treaty should be
signed by year's end.
   ``It's constructive pressure,'' Burt said, and added later that
he was ``very optimistic'' the summit goals could be achieved this
year.
   He and Nazarkin plan to return home in a few days to help
prepare for the meeting Feb. 6-7 in Moscow of Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
Negotiations in Geneva will continue in their absence.
   Burt said he hoped for progress in Moscow on the most difficult
remaining START issues: the permitted range of air-launched cruise
missiles, how to count them and how what to do about bombers that
carry such missiles equipped with conventional rather than nuclear
warheads.

<HEAD>Midsummer Nights' Dreams at Dior, Balmain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Haute couture was a midsummer night's dream at
Monday's shows. Very short, often flirty styles for summer never
looked more expensive and yet feathery-light.
   The clothes, costing many thousands of dollars per outfit, are
mainly for show. Only about 2,000 women regularly buy couture,
which is meant to power the houses' other activities, from
accessories to perfumes.
   Dior's show by Gianfranco Ferre was a suite of expensive clothes
that ended up with mounds of gold, ochre and saffron iridescent
taffetas, satin and sparkling sequins on lace.
   The Italian designer, hired last year by financier Bernard
Arnault to bring the celebrated couture house out of the doldrums,
reworked some of his strong themes. These included huge organza
bows and bold silk-flower corsage effects. The clothes were pretty,
but whether their impact will make Dior top money-earning couture
house in the world is still debatable.
   Ferre's mood was romantic but low-key. The day clothes worn with
amusing high-crowned smokestack or boater hats turned up in black
and white or shades of silvery gray in fitted pinstriped suits with
deep decolletes, insets and tucked-in swaths of white organza, a
Ferre signature touch.
   He is still using organza prodigiously and has already been
copied all over the place in the cloud-like puffy blouses and
enormous bows at waist or neck.
   Lots of trousers here should please high-styled dressers who can
actually afford a couture outfit. Impeccable cuffed gray charcoal
lean pants topped by a fabulous white organza jacket and strapless
bustier would look at home anywhere from Palm Beach to Paris.
   The wicker-chair sparkly embroidery on white jackets over simple
black skirts are also great choices for the moneyed set.
   Except for violet, lilac, a flash of red and all that gold,
Ferre hardly varied his color palette. But the cuts were right on
target, especially when he draped a sexy sheath with a gold
satin-lined long stole.
   Erik Mortensen at Balmain proved once again that he's a great
couturier. He produced a teaser of a sexy collection that offered
plenty of choice besides bare skin in skirts slashed to the hip or
mere slips of handkerchief chiffons adorning nearly nude bodies.
   His day clothes were striking in belted ivory white suits with
sleeveless jackets in contrasting coral, saffron or green soft wool.
   The clothes looked both contemporary and clever, some of the
false cutaway suits turning into short shifts in back. Other
daytime ideas included split paneled skirts, crepe chiffons with
giant polka dots under enormous halo circle hats.
   But from silky bias-cut paneled dresses to jeweled chiffons and
strapless dresses topped with clouds of gazar as stoles, Mortensen
won on all fronts day to evening in a beautifully edited show that
was exciting from start to finish.
   Cardin still knows how to cut and give a fillip to modern
styles. But the impact was watered down by too much of a good
thing. Among the memorable newer looks were his billowy-skirted and
egg-shaped dressy short models in the softest pastel hues _ lots of
violet, aqua and linden or sea green.
   Many of the pretty new outfits were presented by two of his
favorite new mannequins brought in from the Soviet Union, where he
has been manufacturing for two years to pep up the fashion scene.
   All of Cardin's favorite ideas were present and sparkling: huge
collars, enormous flower effects _ the dress becomes a flower _
zig-zag diagonal or swirly asymmetrical coat fastenings,
batwing-sleeve shifts galore.
   An intriguing new suit here was cut with ``step'' effects on the
sharply geometrical jackets.
   Cardin used big floppy bows in profusion, draping a whole dress
from a bow at the neck, or ending up a hemline with a bow. With
lots of navy and white or a raft of pretty pastels, the palette in
luxury fabrics was extended to please anyone.
   He brought out circular hoop stiffening and Chinese-lantern
effects in skirts and sleeves, a rather extravagant way to use some
of these lovely flowered fabarics.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer took another of his exotic trips to India, a
favorite theme he uses over and over again. The outfits fit for a
maharanee included some sensational draped dresses with iridescent
sari-style scarves, lots of mirror sequins, the lightest of silvery
paisley patterns on silks.
   Tulip-draped skirts were beautifully done as were some all-over
pleated and tucked blouses and dresses that were a tour de force.
   Scherrer kept to the softest palette possible in creams, khakis,
light golds, sand tones with echoes of pink. But he sometimes opted
for interesting mixes of hot cyclamen and ochre, shocking pink and
Indian rose in his silk crepes, chiffons and taffetas.
   While several of his trouser suits were topped with
Nehru-collared lean jackets, others were lean midcalf styles with
tunic or jacket toppers.
   Nobody could miss Scherrer's incredible gray and gold
cobra-patterned silk taffeta pants suits with an ample jacket
tightly belted at the waist.

   Former Houston Police Chief Lee Brown was sworn
in Monday as New York's 36th police commissioner, acknowledging the
city's fiscal problems but promising ``clear vision and firm
resolve'' against drugs.
   The audience gave a standing ovation when newly elected Mayor
David Dinkins said: ``Lee, the people of this city are aching. We
hate drugs and what they're doing to our communities and our
children.''
   ``We despise the despair caused by crime, and we are ready to
join together to take back our streets and our parks, by night as
well as by day,'' Dinkins added.
   ``In all candor, I do not come here with a quick and easy
solution to this terrible problem'' of drugs, Brown said. ``No one
does. I will pledge my most earnest and most diligent effort in
lessening the impact of drugs on all the city's neighborhoods.''
   Brown acknowledged the city's budget crisis, saying it may not
be possible to expand the force for some time.
   But he said he looked forward to ``bringing about a safer,
toward bringing about a more secure, toward bringing about a more
liveable city for all New Yorkers.''

   The central files of the former secret police
are to become an archive open to scholars, delegates from the
government and opposition agreed Monday.
   Negotiators called for the East Berlin headquarters of the state
security agency, symbolizing four decades of iron-fisted Communist
control, to become a memorial to the victims of Stalinism.
   The proposed steps were adopted at the latest session of talks
on reform between the Communist-led government and opposition
groups.
   The motion was introduced by the fledgling Greens, an
environmentalist opposition group. Greens delegate Carlo Jordan
called for preserving the central files of the secret police, known
popularly as ``Stasi,'' after thousands of demonstrators ransacked
the headquarters Jan. 15 and destroyed records.
   Researchers at the future archives would help citizens who were
police targets to prepare legal action against the state, Jordan
said.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow has ordered the dismantling of the
Stasi, but opposition groups and street demonstrators have remained
wary of government assurances the agency is being dissolved.
   On Monday, the delegates appointed a three-member panel
including East Berlin Lutheran Bishop Gottfried Forck as civilian
watchdogs over the Stasi's abolition.

<HEAD>Interim Government Switches Gears, May Take Part in Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The provisional government that
replaced the toppled dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu may field
candidates in the April elections, a government spokesman said
Monday.
   A decision to take part in the elections would be a reversal of
the government's earlier insistence that it was only a caretaker
coalition formed to escort Romania to democracy after Ceausescu's
24 years of harsh rule.
   Aurel Dragos Munteanu, state radio and television chief, said no
final decision has been made on whether the governing National
Salvation Front will field candidates.
   ``The country as a whole feels the National Salvation Front
should turn into a movement independent from other political
parties, and nominate its candidates for the forthcoming
elections,'' Munteanu told a news conference, according to the
state news agency Rompres.
   He sought to qualify earlier comments by interim President Ion
Iliescu, who had seemed to indicate the government definitely would
participate in elections.
   ``Mr. Iliescu said we don't know yet. We might go that way or
that way ... It was not a commitment by Mr. Iliescu,'' said
Munteanu, referring to the comments by the acting president in a
meeting with students Sunday.
   The National Salvation Front, a group about 150 members, gained
popular support amid the post-revolutionary chaos by disavowing
electoral ambitions and representing itself as purely an interim
force until parliamentary elections could be held.
   They are tentatively scheduled for April, although some
opposition groups not participating in the interim government have
said they need more time to mount effective campaigns.
   The National Salvation Front is made up of dissidents, military
leaders, intellectuals, technocrats and disgruntled Communists. It
is led by an 11-man council headed by Iliescu, a former Communist
Party secretary who ran afoul of Ceausescu in 1971 and was
ultimately demoted to the job of editor of a technical publishing
house.
   Munteanu noted that the leaders said after Ceausescu was
overthrown Dec. 22 that they did not consider the National
Salvation Front to be a political party. But then he told the news
conference that ``It is a feeling in the country by many people ..
. that is calling for the front in one way or another to take
part.''
   Asked a question about Romania's economy, Munteanu noted that
the front's governing council may still be running the country
after elections. He did not elaborate.
   The National Salvation Front, which has taken enormous powers
into its own hands, governs this nation of 23 million people by
decree.
   Acting as an ad hoc legislature, the front has repealed the
regime's most hated laws, opened borders for Romanians, appointed
ministers and taken over the media.
   Iliescu and his defense minister, Gen. Nicolae Militaru command
the 180,000 army troops whose switch of sides turned December's
street demonstrations into a successful revolution.
   Iliescu fired all Ceausescu ministers, but retained midlevel
administrators.
   Critics of the government have complained that some of its
members were too closely associated with Ceausescu's government and
may have plans to continue some form of Communist rule.
   Commenting on Romania's future economy, Munteanu said he favored
privatization ``to some extent'' but added it would be difficult to
have an economy as privatized as in Western countries.
   Munteaunu also said the first trials of Ceausescu aides probably
would begin next week, adding the defendants would include former
Communist Party secretary Emil Bobu, third in the Ceausescu
hierarchy after the dictator and his wife, Elena; and former
Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu, who supervised Ceausescu's
dreaded special police.
   Also likely to be tried next week are former Premier Manea
Manescu and Ion Dinca, a former high-ranking Politburo member.
   Prosecutor-General Gheorghe Robu said the four have been
indicted on charges of genocide for their role in violently
suppressing demonstrations during the December revolution, Rompres
reported.
   Ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad Dec. 25.

   The White House said Monday the Overseas
Private Investment Corp. is recuiting U.S. businesses for an
investment mission to Panama, which is struggling to rebuild its
economy following the toppling of the Noriega regime.
   The announcement touted Panama's ``excellent potential'' for
U.S. investors interested in farming, light industry and tourism.
   OPIC, a federal agency, will arrange a Feb. 23-28 trip to Panama
to familiarize U.S. investors with the economic and political
climate in Panama and to meet with that nation's new government and
business leaders, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   The purpose ``is to help rebuild the Panamanian economy,'' he
said.
   Panama's economy was under heavy strain from U.S. sanctions
before the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion, which dethroned strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega. Several hundred Panamanians, as well as 23 U.S.
soldiers, died in the fighting, which devastated sections of Panama
City.
   Estimates of how much it will cost to repair the damage in
Panama have ranged from several hundred million dollars to as high
as $2 billion.
   Fitzwater, in a written statement, said, ``Panama's business
infrastructure retains attractive features such as transportation,
communications and financial services. It has excellent potential
in agriculture, aquaculture, light industy and tourism.''
   OPIC is the federal agency responsible for encouraging
investment in developing countries. In the last year, it has led
investment missions to sub-Saharan Africa, Poland, Hungary, Bolivia
and other nations.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in Monday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.6 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.66 percent, down from 7.68 percent
last week. Another $7.6 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.58 percent, up from 7.54 percent last
week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.57
percent on Jan. 8, and the highest since six-month bills averaged
7.64 percent on Dec. 26.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.92 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,806.40 and 7.99 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,616.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 7.97
percent last week, up from 7.78 percent the previous week.

   More than 3,000 high school students
demonstrated Monday for a broader education than the narrow
curriculum enforced by the regime of deposed dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   The demonstration was also aimed at the abolition of special
exams at the end of the second year of high school, which students
must pass in their major field of study or face expulsion.
   ``If Elena Ceausescu can fall down, our exam must fall down,
too!'' the students chanted as they marched from the Ministry of
Education to the provisional government headquarters.
   Student leaders said they had given the provisional government
one month from Dec. 22, when the Ceausescus were forced to flee the
city, to do away with the special exam. Ceausescu reportedly
intended to drop the exam this year.
   ``Until now, they have told us nothing. That's why we're here,''
said Rodica Guja, 16.
   ``We want to study the real history because the history they
taught us before was a wrong history,'' she said. ``We want to
obtain culture and we want more subjects. We want to study the
history of art, science, foreign languages.''
   There was a sense of exhiliaration as the students wound their
way along the icy streets of old Bucharest behind a Romanian flag
with the Communist emblem torn out.
   ``The police just look at us. Before, if we did something like
this, we would be arrested and beaten,'' Miss Guja said.
   The students from about 15 schools walked out of classes Monday.
   Romania has specialized high schools in industrial fields and
academic subjects such as mathematics and physics, language and
history, chemistry and biology.
   Rosu Costin, who is studying math and physics, said the exams
were so difficult that students needed private tutoring to pass.
   ``This isn't fair because poor students don't have money to pay
professors at home,'' said Costih, 16, adding that the $4,450
needed for a year of tutoring was enough to buy a small car.
   Engineering student Bogdan Popescu said he was demonstrating
because the exam meant students learned only two subjects and
didn't have ``a general culture.''
   Ozana Ninosu, studying at the German high school, said: ``I
don't learn anything in school, just a little German.''
   She said she wanted to study art, music, and learn the true
history of her country and the rest of the world.
   All the students complained that they had to wear gloves and
coats in their classrooms because the schools were so cold.
   Costin said many youngsters were unable to attend sports classes
because they didn't have enough to eat and had no energy.
   At the former Foreign Ministry building, now headquarters of the
National Salvation Front provisional government, a delegation of
students was chosen to meet Education Minister Mihai Sora.
   Zosim Basir, a member of the Front, told the students that
Romania's economic plight had top priority.
   ``The young people are in revolution,'' he said, ``and in a
revolutionary situation, everything comes mixed up.''

   More than 170,000 toy whistles were recalled
on Monday by their manufacturer because they present a potentially
fatal choking hazard to young children, the government said.
   Approximately 174,000 ``Siren Whistle'' toys, manufactured by
the Kansas-based Mitchell Import Co., Inc. were recalled because
they easily break apart into small pieces that can be swallowed by
a child, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said in a statement.
   The toys consist of a set of six solid-color, 1}-inch whistles.
   Consumers who have the toys, which were sold nationwide from
1988 to 1989, should take them away from children and return them
to the store where they were purchased for a full refund, the
agency said.
   The CPSC said there have been no reports of injuries involving
the toy but the voluntary recall was done as a preventive action.

<HEAD>Law Would Allow Seizure of Johns' Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIE AICHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legislator has introduced a bill that would
allow police to seize and sell vehicles of people engaged in
prostitution in an effort to bring more pressure on johns.
   ``We believe the crucial point of attack on this issue is the
john _ the guy who's waiting in the car looking for a prostitute,''
said the legislator, Rep. Peter Bock.
   ``We want to embarrass that guy and make things harder for
him,'' he said.
   Bock said he decided to act after residents had complained of
finding condoms and needles in their yards. He drove through one
neighborhood in his Milwaukee district and found women soliciting
men on street corners.
   ``At that point I realized there was a problem,'' said Bock, 41,
who was propositioned before dusk on that evening last summer.
   Bock's bill would enable police to seize and sell the vehicles
of people convicted of engaging in prostitution if the vehicle is
used in the act. Besides reducing prostitution, the bill would help
prevent the spread of AIDS.
   Milwaukee's West End Community Association, a community group,
has long urged stiffer penalties for crimes involving prostitution,
especially punishment that focuses on the customer.
   ``Unless the fines and penalties are stiffer, how can we expect
to stop this problem,'' said Lora Gooden, director of the
non-profit group, who said prostitutes have ``no problem finding
business in this city.''
   ``They (customers) have been slapped on the hand with these
mediocre fines and they can get home before anyone knows they were
arrested,'' she said.
   The solution is in targeting the customer, not the prostitute,
proponents of the bill say.
   ``As long as the demand is out there, those women will be out
there,'' Ms. Gooden said. ``If the prostitutes get fined, they'll
just be out there working harder to pay it. We have to take away
the demand.''
   Under the proposed law, a car that has been confiscated can not
be sold until a person had been found guilty of having performed a
sexual act in the car, Bock said. A resolution to the bill will
urge newspapers to print the names of people found guilty of
engaging in prostitution.
   ``It's a common thing for these men to drive by, pick up a
prostitute, drive around the corner, have sex and then drop her
off,'' Ms. Gooden said. ``A lot of the activity has been going on
in the cars.''
   Ms. Gooden said she doesn't believe the bill will stop
prostitution, but it ``would cause them (the johns) to have to
explain why their cars aren't there.''
   A similar bill in Portland, Ore., drew criticism from the Oregon
American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``The seizure takes place at the sole discretion of the police
officer,'' said Stevie Remington, executive director of the Oregon
ACLU. ``That's a violation of due process.''
   Portland Police Department spokesman David Simpson said the
department has seized six vehicles since the bill became law in
December and hasn't had any problems.
   Public nuisance laws in Wisconsin allow the court to seize and
sell any personal property involved with prostitution, creating the
possibility an entire family could be left homeless if one person
engaged in sex for pay, said Eunice Edgar, executive director of
the Wisconsin ACLU.
   ``Obviously, we see some problems with that,'' Ms. Edgar said.
``I'm not sure how the seizure of vehicles would apply. I think
there's a double-whammy for women who are married to philanderers.
   ``First, they're subjected to humiliation and then they lose the
family car and can't go to work,'' she said.
   Ms. Edgar said the Wisconsin ACLU lawyers would review the bill.

   East German border guards began tearing down
a 330-yard section of the Berlin Wall on Monday night to begin

   The dismantling work began along the Kreuzberg district that
borders the wall in the southeastern sector of the divided city,

   Kolhoff said an East German border official told him other
sections of the wall would be torn down shortly as well, but he was
not specific about when that would occur.
   East Germany's interim president, Manfred Gerlach of the Liberal
Democratic Party, disclosed on Jan. 2 that the wall built in 1961
would be replaced with ``normal border markings.''
   There had been no public announcement by the East German
government on the dismantling.
   Kolhoff said he was informed that the stretch of wall being torn
down now would be replaced by a six-foot metal fence by Friday.

<TEXT>
   Drug lords released the kidnapped son of
a presidential adviser Monday, apparently in another bid to
persuade the government to end its 5-month-old war on cocaine
trafficking.
   Alvaro Diego Montoya had been abducted at gunpoint from his
office Dec. 20 in Bogota. He is the son of German Montoya,
President Virgilio Barco's general secretary.
   A statement issued by his family said Montoya was freed on a
Bogota street early Monday.
   Montoya was the fifth person released by the drug traffickers
since Thursday. Another 16, including prominent businessmen or
their relatives, still were being held, apparently for use in
bargaining to get the government to negotiate a truce in the
nation's bloody drug war.
   A newspaper reported Monday that only some of the nation's
traffickers are willing to negotiate.
   A communique issued last week with the release of two kidnap
victims said the drug lords would dismantle their cocaine-smuggling
empire and release all hostages in exchange for amnesty.
   Interior Minister Carlos Lemos Simmonds said that under no
circumstances would the government negotiate with the traffickers,
and that they must surrender and face the judicial system.
   However, the government since has said it is waiting for
clarification on what the drug lords want, and Barco has made
seemingly conflicting statements on his position.
   He has said on the one hand that his hard-line position of
fighting the traffickers has not changed, but also that the
government will not be inflexible in looking for a way to end the
war.
   In a letter published in the Bogota daily El Tiempo on Saturday,
he said it would be ``simplistic to believe that the only two
alternatives are blind and stubborn repression or wide-open talks
with the criminals.''
   The traffickers' communique has been widely interpreted by the
press in Colombia, but it appears the drug lords want assurances
that they will not be extradited to the United States.
   The government began its crackdown after the cocaine lords
assassinated a leading presidential candidate on Aug. 18.
   Since then, the government has extradited to the United States
13 Colombians facing charges of drug smuggling, trafficking and
money laundering.
   Authorities also killed Rodrigo Gonzalo Gacha, a founding member
of the Medellin cocaine cartel.
   The traffickers responded with a terror campaign that has killed
209 people, including 106 who died when a bomb blew a Colombian
airliner out of the sky. Authorities blamed them for 262 acts,
including bombings and arson.
   El Tiempo said Monday there was disagreement among the
traffickers about whether to surrender or continue fighting.
   The traffickers' offer Wednesday to abandon cocaine smuggling
came only from the Medellin cartel's two top men, Pablo Escobar and
Luis Ochoa, El Tiempo said, quoting military intelligence sources.
   The daily said the army had intercepted a message indicating
that the Cali cartel, another big band of traffickers, would not
surrender or negotiate a truce in the war.
   The Medellin and Cali cartels, named after two Colombian cities,
fought a gang war last year that killed more than 200 people.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Canon Law Not Sufficient To Seal Bishop's Deposition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled Monday that a bishop's
right to confidentiality under religious law is not sufficient to
keep the court from releasing pretrial testimony in a case
involving a priest who molested boys.
   ``I feel that good cause has never been established for the
sealing of a deposition based upon an argument that it is to
protect a canonized right alleged to be a First Amendment
guarantee,'' said Superior Court Judge Thomas Needham.
   Lawyers for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence had argued
that under a theological doctrine called ``internal forum,''
priests must keep secret anything told to them in confidence by
church members.
   The depositions had not been filed by Monday afternoon.
   The depositions were taken for a lawsuit filed in 1986 by a
Narragansett woman and her son, who was one of three boys the Rev.
William C. O'Connell was convicted, after pleading no contest, of
sexually abusing while pastor of St. Mary's Church.
   The $14 million lawsuit contends Bishop Louis E. Gelineau and
Auxiliary Bishop Kenneth A. Angell were negligent in failing to
remove the priest from his Bristol parish after they knew, or
should have known, of his activities.
   The plaintiffs contend Gelineau knew of concerns involving
O'Connell's relationship with young boys as early as November 1983.
The diocese did not remove O'Connell from his position until after
his arrest in 1985.
   Gelineau cited internal forum in refusing to answer 128
questions at his deposition last June. Superior Judge John P.
Bourcier in September ordered 75 of those questions answered.
   Lawyer William A. Curran, an attorney for the diocese, then
tried to seal the testimony. He argued that ``it's our right under
the First Amendment, to free exercise of religion'' to follow the
theological rules of internal forum.
   The diocese also said the depositions would be ``used as fuel
for the fire'' of publicity surrounding the case.
   Rhode Island is considered by the church to be the most Catholic
state in the country on a per capita basis, with 64 percent of its
population Catholic, said William Halpin, a spokesman for the
diocese.
   Needham referred to a 1983 U.S. Supreme Court case involving The
Seattle Times Co. and Keith M. Rhinehart, a spiritual leader, in
making his decision. In that instance, however, the court ordered
depositions sealed because ``the affidavits of the respondents and
those members of the (religious) foundation supported the danger
that release of their names would bring reprisals or fear of
reprisals,'' Needham said.
   Needham said there was no indication that people not involved in
the Rhode Island lawsuit would be harmed if the bishops'
depositions were made public.
   He also said depositions given by two priests, Monsignor
Salvatore Matano and the Rev. Robert Evans, should be filed with
the court.
   Curran had asked those answers be sealed because the priests
were asked to assess the truthfulness of other priests _ material
he said would not be admissible at trial and therefore should not
be open to the public.
   ``I didn't have anything to give other than my own thinking,''
said Curran. ``I don't fault the court.''
   R. Daniel Prentiss, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he had no
comment.
   O'Connell pleaded no contest to 26 counts of sexual contact with
three boys, who were 12, 14 and 17 at the time in June 1986. He was
given a one-year sentence in a work release program and ordered to
take two years of therapy in a church-run program.

   development programs in each state. Members will include
representatives of governors and all federal departments
administering rural development programs locally.
   Yeutter later told a news conference that the thrust of Bush's
rural development includes farming as the mainstay of rural
economies.
   ``Clearly, production agriculture is still by far the most
important source of earnings for rural America,'' he said. And that
is ``likely to continue for as long as we can visualize.''
   Thus, Yeutter added, it is most important for rural development
``to make sure that we have a very healthy farm economy.''
   But Yeutter said there was a need to go beyond the farm economy
in matters of economic development for the small towns and
communities where about 60 million Americans live, including only
about 5 million farmers and their families.
   It is not enough to ask rural America to be dependent entirely
on production agriculture, Yeutter said. That became evident in the
early 1980s as hard times hit the nation's agriculture, oil and gas
areas and energy-based industries.
   One of the objectives will be to determine which programs and
how much money are available for rural people from dozens of
offices scattered among federal agencies.
   Yeutter and Undersecretary Roland R. Vatour, who directly
oversees small community and rural development programs, said they
had no solid estimate on how much federal money might be available.
   However, Vatour said that in USDA alone, programs operated by
the Farmers Home Administration, Rural Electrification
Administration and Extension Service have budgets totaling $8
billion to $8.5 billion.
   ``There is ample potential here to get a great deal more bang
for the buck in rural development,'' Yeutter said. ``We certainly
could devote additional financial resources to this issue, just as
we could devote additional resources to a lot of other things.''
   Other steps ordered by Bush included:
   _A series of rural development demonstration programs to help
identify regional needs, develop action plans, bring together
available resources,and evaluate the process for possible use on a
larger scale. Yeutter said that project had not been formally set
up.
   _The Agriculture Department will set up a rural development
technical assistance center and hot line to provide detailed
information on federal programs that serve rural communities. The
center also will link callers with federal, state and regional
program officials.
   _Targeting of ``limited federal budget resources'' on activities
that generate maximum economic benefits.
   _The Economic Policy Council's working group on rural
development will become a permanent fixture at the White House to
``implement any rural development initiatives'' developed by the
new council and approved by the administration.

<HEAD>Military Government to Begin Registering Political Party Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military government of Gen. Ibrahim
Babangida announced Monday it will begin registering members of the
two political parties it has created to return Africa's most
populous nation to civilian rule.
   The statement said the registration will begin in March and will
be conducted by administrative secretaries appointed by the
military.
   Also Monday, Babangida defended the soldiers who have seized
power several times in Nigeria, saying they acted against ``the
monopolistic interest of our civilian leadership that transformed
political parties into war machines of the electoral process.''
   Babangida's six-year-old government faces increasing criticism
from civilians following a December leadership reshuffle that also
has increased tensions between Moslems and Christians, who accuse
the military leader of favoring fellow followers of Islam.
   All former politicians and leading members of Babangida's
government are banned from seeking office.
   Parties also are banned from creating women's and youth groups
because, the government says, those groups were used to break up
rallies of opponents, harass followers of rival parties and, in
some cases, beat up rival candidates and their supporters.
   Public denunciations of the military here have grown since
Babangida's Armed Forces Ruling Council in October rejected
nominations of 13 organizations seeking to register as political
parties. Babangida said all were tainted by the corruption and
ethnic and religious factionalism that he blames for the failure of
previous civilian governments.
   Instead, the military government itself created two political
parties, one center-right and one left-leaning, and is writing
their platforms.
   Babangida told an annual conference Monday of senior military
officers that they don't need to be defensive when responding to
criticisms leveled by civilians of the military's intervention in
politics.
   ``Those who quarrel about how to share the rooms of a house, the
foundation of which is collapsing, can only with extreme charity be
condemned for lack of wisdom,'' he said. Soldiers have governed
Nigeria by force for all but nine years of the country's 29 years
of independence from Britain.
   Babangida dismissed as simplistic criticisms by the media, which
has condemned the military as an overzealous, power-hungry
organization.
   Military men are patriots ``largely responsible for preserving
the country,'' Babangida said.
   The public criticism has been compounded by religious
animosities aroused after the government on Dec. 29 dismissed Gen.
Domkat Bali as defense minister. Bali, a Christian, was demoted
after he called Babangida a dictator. He subsequently resigned.

<TEXT>
   Premier Hans Modrow said Monday he would open
the Cabinet to the pro-democracy opposition, and former Communist
Party leader Egon Krenz apologized for his role in secret police
operations.
   They spoke during negotiations on East Germany's future between
the party and opposition groups, which immediately accepted
Modrow's offer.
   Pro-democracy activists demonstrated in at least eight cities
after nightfall, including more than 100,000 in Leipzig. The
official news agency ADN also reported rallies in Berlin, Cottbus,
Dresden, Halle, Potsdam, Schwerin and Suhl.
   East German border guards began tearing down a 330-yard section
of the Berlin Wall in the Kreuzberg district, to be replaced by a
metal fence, said Werner Kolhoff, a West Berlin government
spokesman. He said an East German official told him other sections
would be dismantled soon.
   Manfred Gerlach of the Liberal Democratic Party, interim
president of East Germany, said Jan. 2 the wall would be replaced
with ``normal border markings.'' The Berlin Wall was built in 1961.
   Modrow bowed to pressure to revise his 27-member Cabinet, which
previously excluded all but Communists and traditional allies.
   The leadership, which replaced Communist hard-liners last year
during a peaceful popular revolt, has been trying to appease an
opposition upset with the pace of promised reform. Modrow's
declaration came one day after the No. 2 figure in the Communist
Party quit and joined the Social Democrats.
   Until Monday, reformist groups such as New Forum, Democratic
Awakening and the Social Democracts had resisted joining Modrow's
government, partly from fear voters would hold them responsible by
for the economic mess left by four decades of Communist rule.
   The Social Democratic leader, Ibrahim Boehme, said a coalition
was possible ``if all parties and groups are prepared to enter the
government on an emergency basis, without weeks-long negotiations.''
   Modrow proposed political groups meet Wednesday to consider a
new Cabinet, but did not make clear which or how many ministries
might be offered the opposition.
   Communists hold 16 of the 27 seats and the remainder are divided
among four parties once allied with them: the Liberal Democrats
with four, Christian Democrats with three and two each for the
National Democrats and farmers' party.
   East Germany's first free elections are to be held May 6, but
broad differences between the Communist-dominated government and
opposition groups have delayed economic reform measures and
hindered the transition to democracy.
   Krenz, who was ousted from the leadership Dec. 3 and expelled by
his party Sunday, apologized for the ``old security doctrine'' he
imposed on the country.
   He appeared before the political forum to answer allegations
that he helped falsify previous election results and misused the
secret police service for political aims.
   The 52-year-old career politician conceded there had never been
free elections in East Germany, ``only ballot-folding,'' and said
he believed some votes failed to reach the central counting
facility after elections in May.
   But he denied the results were falsified, and cast himself as
one who had fought for change from within.
   Krenz apologized for his role in leading East Germany to its
crisis and said he hoped the people would forgive him.
   ``As a citizen and Christian I accept your apology,'' responded
Wolfgang Ullmann of the Democracy Now reform movement.
   In a rare display of unity, the opposition groups joined Modrow
in denouncing a West German newspaper report Monday alleging that
soldiers and secret police agents were planning a coup.
   The Hamburg newspaper Bild contended the renegades had held
joint exercises and said a general strike could be used as the
pretext for an armed takeover.
   ``I must decisively reject as provocation a report in today's
Bild newspaper,'' Modrow said.
   He said he had checked with the interior and defense ministers,
who assured him no signs of such preparation had been detected.
   Wolfgang Schnur, a leader in the Democratic Awakening movement,
called the Bild report a ``horror story.''
   Modrow also announced the resignation of Communist Finance
Minister Uta Nickel, the target of a criminal inquiry into alleged
financial irregularities. Ms. Nickel has denied wrongdoing.
   On Sunday, the Communists lost one of their most popular members
when Dresden Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer, a party deputy chairman,
defected to the Social Democrats.
   The moves were expected to cause mass defections from the party.
Its membership in the country of 16.3 million people has plunged to
1.2 million from nearly 2.3 million in 1987.

<HEAD>US Accuses Sandinistas of Anti-Semitic Remarks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department accused the Nicaraguan
government Monday of using anti-Semitic remarks to try to discredit
what the Sandinistas contend is a bungled U.S. effort to help
finance the Nicaraguan electoral process.
   At issue is an editorial in last Thursday's edition of the
government-controlled newspaper ``Barricada'' which tried to
explain why the ``Yankee bureaucracy'' has had difficulty in
disbursing the money.
   The editorial said there has been an ``excessive distrust'' by
the ``Yankees'' toward the leading opposition coalition in
Nicaragua and attributes this to the ``traditional `Jew-style' with
which the U.S. Congress manages the taxes of the taxpayers.''
   Congress, with the stated aim of promoting fair elections, has
approved funds for such politically neutral projects as verifying
voter registration lists and training poll watchers. Other funds
were earmarked for the opposition coalition led by presidential
candidate Violeta Chamorro.
   With the election just five weeks away, however, only a small
fraction of the money has been delivered to the designated
recipients. Partly as a result, the opposition campaign has been
far less visible than the Sandinistas'.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler blamed the
Sandinista government for the logjam in the disbursement of the
U.S. funds and ridiculed the Barricada's comments.
   ``The Nicaraguan government is doing everything in its power to
block moneys designed by Congress to help level the playing field
for the opposition,'' she said.
   ``To resort to anti-Semitism in its attempt to explain to
Nicaraguans why it has failed to live up to the promises it made
... to the national opposition is contemptible and does a profound
disservice to the Nicaraguan people, to Congress and to all who
want open, free and fair elections in February.''
   The funds earmarked for Nicaragua are channeled through the
National Endowment for Democracy, which uses international
affiliates of the U.S. Democratic and Republican parties as
conduits.
   The Barricada editorial makes references to two officials of the
National Democratic Institite, Ken Wollack and Barry Feierstein. It
claimed that the funds earmarked for the election campaign are
being diverted by Nicaraguan opposition leaders for ``renovating
their homes and purchasing new cars.''
   Wollack, the executive vice president of the institute, refused
comment on the editorial. Feierstein was not available for comment.
   The Reagan administration frequently charged the Sandinista
government with anti-Semitic activities but was hard-pressed to
back up its allegations.
   President Reagan's allegations were undercut by his own
ambassador to Managua, Anthony Quainton, who said in a secret July
1983 memo that ``the evidence fails to demonstrate that the
Sandinistas have followed a policy of anti-Semitism or have
persecuted Jews solely because of their religion.
   ``Although most members of Nicaragua's tiny Jewish community
have left the country and some have had their properties
confiscated, there is no direct correlation between their Jewish
religion and the treatment they received from the ( Sandinistas),''
Quainton's memo said.

   Safety, insurance, medical and police experts
Monday asked Nissan not to show a television fantasy commercial for
its 300ZX Turbo sports car on grounds it promotes ``excessive and
unsafe speed.''
   ``This is hitting a new low in automobile advertising,'' said
Brian O'Neill, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety. ``This is the worst example of an out-and-out speed ad
we've ever seen.''
   The company declined, saying it believed the ad would never be
taken for real.
   In the dream-like commercial, set on an automotive speedway, the
300ZX Turbo outpaces a motorcycle, race car and jet plane as its
driver murmurs: ``Some have to dream. I'm in a Turbo 300 and these
guys are after me _ and they can't catch me.''
   In the final shot of the commercial, scheduled to be shown
during next Sunday's Superbowl football championship, the car leaps
from the ground, all four wheels in the air.
   ``The message in the ad is simple and straight forward: Look at
how fast this car can go,'' O'Meill told a news conference.
   O'Neill said the commercial ``irresponsibly promotes excessive
speed and exhibits a blatant disregard for public safety.''
   He was joined in denouncing the ad by Dr. Howard Champion,
director of the Medstar shock-trauma unit at the Washington
Hospital Center, Lt. Col. C.M. Robinson of the Virginia State
Police and retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Robert McDermott, chairman
of USAA Insurance Group of San Antonio.
   ``When you're promoting speed and killing young people, you're
going too far,'' McDermott said, who pronounced himself
``surprised, outraged and disgusted'' with the commercial.
   Asked if his company would continue to insure the 300ZX,
McDermott replied: ``We may not.'' But later he told a reporter:
``I don't want to threaten them. I want to wait and see if they
pull the ad.''
   Dan Spetner, a Nissan spokesman in Los Angeles, dismissed the
criticism.
   ``We believe that the Turbo 300 ad is so futuristic and
far-fetched that it would never be interpreted as representing a
real-life driving situation,'' Spetner said.
   ``It should be up to the American public to decide what can or
cannot be shown on our airwaves,'' he said.
   ``Nissan claims this ad is a fantasy,'' O'Neill said. ``But what
isn't a fantasy at ll ... is that people are dying in high-speed
crashes involving this car.''
   He displayed photographs of two demolished 300ZX models taken
after recent crashes in which three people were killed.
   O'Neill also complained that Nissan's 1990 300ZX is not equipped
with safety airbags but instead features what he said are ``vastly
inferior detachable automatic belt systems.''
   ``Nissan's contention that the ad is a fantasy is a transparent
farce,'' McDermott said. ``It has only one, unmistakable,
overpowering message _ speed, period.''
   O'Neill said his institute estimates that the 300ZX in the
commercial was exceeding 150 mph.
   ``If there was a crash at that speed there would be nothing left
of that car _ little pieces,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal Edmund Szoka, known for his cost-cutting
and fund-raising success as archbishop in the nation's
fifth-largest diocese, on Monday accepted a papal appointment to a
post at the Vatican.
   A Vatican announcement said Szoka will head the Prefecture for
Economic Affairs of the Holy See, which draws up the Vatican's
budget. Szoka announced his acceptance of the position in a news
conference.
   Pope John Paul II and Szoka discussed the Vatican post in
December during one of the archbishop's visits to Rome. The
62-year-old prelate has been serving on a special commission
studying ways to overcome the Vatican's chronic budget deficit.
   ``In that conversation, (the pope) said he realized that it
would be difficult for me to leave Detroit and for that reason he
made it very clear that he was only asking me to consider accepting
this appointment,'' Szoka said.
   He said the pope offered to let him both jobs, but Szoka, who
has undergone angioplasty for a narrowed artery, said serving in
both posts would stretch him too thin, and both the Prefecture and
the Detroit Archdiocese would suffer.
   Some time in June, Szoka will succeed Cardinal Giuseppe Caprio,
a 75-year-old Italian who resigned because of his age.
   Szoka's fiscal skills have brought him praise and criticism _
the latter stemming from the closings of 30 inner-city parishes of
the 1.5-million member archdiocese last year. He cited a shortage
of priests, declining membership and the increasing costs of
maintaining the church buildings.
   Earlier this month, five other inner-city parishes were ordered
to close after failing to show their viability during a one-year
reprieve.
   The Vatican itself has ordered austerity measures.
   In 1988, the Vatican reported it was $57 million in the red. It
since has cut the deficit by $9 million. Szoka said he hopes to be
able to cut the deficit further.
   ``I have some ideas, but the question is how do I implement
them? The bureaucracy has been in place for 2,000 years.''

   Five hundred policemen raided Nile River
islands south of Luxor and seized 400 acres of poppies being grown
for illegal opium, the state-run daily Al-Akhbar reported Tuesday.
   Al-Akhbar said police arrested six men found hiding behind thick
reeds that protected the poppy fields.
   The operation was planned for a week and occurred Sunday, the
newspaper reported. It called the raid ``The Fall of Colombia,'' a
reference to the cocaine industry in that South American country.
   Photographs published by Al-Akhbar showed officers stepping from
rubber dinghies onto a small island 65 miles south of Luxor. It
said the raiders seize 6.36 million poppy plants on 400 acres.
   Sunday's raid was the first major operation reported under Maj.
Gen. Abdel-Halim Moussa, who replaced Zaki Badr as interior
minister earlier this month.
   Al-Akhbar quoted Moussa as saying he would give special
attention to fighting drugs, a problem that has grown steadily the
past five years.
   It said police raided the islands last year but the poppy
growers were heavily armed and drove them off. ``The area was a
fortress ... because of natural factors and because of the ferocity
of its inhabitants,'' the paper reported.

   FBI agents and an Army bomb squad
searched two downtown warehouses Monday in a sweep federal law
enforcement sources said was linked to the mail bomb slayings of a
judge in Birmingham and a civil rights lawyer in Georgia.
   FBI agents were seen executing a search warrant at one
warehouse, and a bomb squad from nearby Fort Rucker Army base went
to a second warehouse.
   Coffee County sheriff's officers referred all inquiries to the
FBI in Washington. Asked if the search was connected with the mail
bomb killings, FBI spokeswoman Kelley Cibulas replied, ``It could
very well.'' She said details could not be released now, but a
statement likely would be issued later by the FBI.
   But federal law enforcement sources in Washington who spoke on
the condition they not be identified by name said the search was
one of several connected with the mail bomb slayings.
   Package bombs sent through the mail exploded and killed U.S.
Circuit Judge Robert Vance at his Mountain Brook home near
Birmingham on Dec. 16 and a black lawyer, Robert Robinson of
Savannah, on Dec. 18. Other mailed bombs were found and defused at
the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, the court Vance
served, and the NAACP office in Jacksonville, Fla.
   The FBI has said one or more white racists appear behind the
mail bomb attacks.
   The warehouse search was one of several being conducted by FBI
agents in the area around Dothan in an attempt to find bombing
paraphernalia or other evidence, the federal sources said.

<HEAD>U.S. Says No Sign Israel Selling Cluster Bombs to Ethiopia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department, disputing a published
report, said Monday it had no evidence that Israel was providing
Ethiopia with cluster bombs.
   The report, in Sunday's New York Times, quoted unnamed State
Department and Pentagon officials. It followed a statement by
former President Jimmy Carter a month ago that ``one of our Middle
East allies'' had provided cluster bombs to the Ethiopian air force.
   Carter, who has been trying to mediate an end to a long civil
war between the Marxist government in Addis Ababa and Eritrean
rebels, did not identify Israel specifically.
   Asked about the Times report, Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State
Department spokeswoman, said: ``We have no clear physical evidence
that Israel has provided such weapons to the government of
Ethiopia.''
   She said Secretary of State James A. Baker III raised the issue
with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin at a meeting here last
Thursday and was told that ``Israel has not provided cluster bombs
to Ethiopia and would not do so.''
   Ethiopia re-established relations with Israel last October after
a 16-year break. Its friendship with the Jewish state goes back to
the Old Testament.
   In recent years, however, Israel has been unable to arrange with
the Marxist government for the emigration of thousands of
impoverished black Jews. Others were smuggled out before the
``Operation Moses'' exodus was halted.
   Last week, without elaboration, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir voiced confidence that all those remaining in Ethiopia would
be allowed to go to Israel.
   The United States suspended sale of cluster bombs to Israel in
1982 after they were used during an incursion into Lebanon. In
1988, the ban was lifted, but Ms. Tutwiler said no American cluster
bombs had been sent to Israel since.
   The Times story quoted officials as saying they did not know
whether the cluster bombs reportedly provided to Ethiopia were
American-made or Israeli-made.
   A cluster bomb, dropped from an airplane, explodes and releases
scores of small bombs contained in the canister. It can have severe
tactical and psychological effect because of the series of
explosions that are set off.

   The stock market took another drubbing Monday,
with the Dow Jones industrial average suffering its 10th-biggest
daily drop ever amid worries about the outlook for corporate
profits and interest rates.
   The widely watched Dow average of 30 blue-chip stocks finished
down 77.45 points at 2,600.45, its largest one-day point loss since
a 190-point drop last Oct. 13.
   Broader market indicators also fell sharply and more than five
stocks declined in price for each one that rose on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Analysts said traders remained uneasy about weak corporate
earnings reports for the fourth quarter of 1988, as well as the
recent upturn in open-market interest rates.
   The Federal Reserve Board is seen as facing an increasingly
difficult set of choices in setting monetary policy to stave off a
recession while trying to keep inflation at bay.
   If the Fed decides to boost interest rates to quell inflation,
that could hurt profits.
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, will be making several
appearances before congressional committees in the near future.
   Wall Streeters will be watching closely to see what positions
Greenspan might take on such matters as the risk that rising
worldwide interest rates might pose for the U.S. business outlook.

   Rebels fighting the Ethiopian government
on Monday released the crew of a Polish cargo ship attacked in the
Red Sea on Jan. 3 and the Poles were flown home within hours, the
official Sudan News Agency said.
   The rebels believed the vessel was carrying arms for government
forces.
   SUNA quoted Ali Shummo, minister of information and culture, as
saying rebels of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front handed over
30 Poles to a Sudanese military team at the border with Ethiopia
shortly after midnight.
   Three hours later, the Poles arrived at Port Sudan, the
country's major port on the Red Sea. SUNA said they were flown home
in the afternoon by a special plane provided by the Polish
government.
   In Cairo, a Polish Embassy spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Poles included 29 crew members and the wife of
one of them.
   Rebels in northern Eritrea province, a former Italian colony on
the Red Sea, have fought for secession since Eritrea was
incorporated by Ethiopia in 1962.
   The rebels said they attacked the 8,137-ton Polish freighter
Boleslaw Krzywousty on Jan. 3 as it steamed from Port Sudan to
Massawa, a port in Eritrea.
   A rebel spokesman contacted from Bahrain on Jan. 7 said the
freighter was one of two ships the rebels attacked on suspicion
they carried arms to Ethiopia's Marxist government. The attacks,
apparently from shore gun batteries, were in the first week of
January, he said.
   ``We were sure one of the two Polish ships was carrying arms to
Ethiopia,'' the spokesman said. He identified the other target as
the motor vessel Adam Asnyk.
   He gave no details, but shipping sources in the Persian Gulf
said they received information the Boleslaw Krzywousty was left
stranded and ablaze 50 miles from Massawa.
   The Boleslaw Krzywousty, a general cargo ship owned by the
Polish Shipping Association, had its home port at Gdynia on the
Baltic Sea.
   Peter Vanau headed a Polish government team that negotiated the
release with rebel representatives.

<HEAD>Vice President Says GOP Should Lead In Civil Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republican Party must correct its past
mistakes and become a leader in civil rights, Vice President Dan
Quayle said Monday in the city where racial tensions were
heightened by the Stuart murder case.
   Quayle toured a Catholic school in the Mission Hill neighborhood
where a white couple, Charles and Carol Stuart, were shot Oct. 23.
Later Quayle attended a GOP fundraiser where he noted how recent
events in Boston have brought racial issues to the forefront.
   Stuart was wounded and his pregnant wife was killed, and he led
police and the public to believe their assailant was a black
mugger. When Stuart committed suicide this month, knowing he had
been implicated in his wife's murder, black leaders criticized the
city and police for the way the black community was treated.
   Quayle said there was no need to comment on specific aspects of
the case, but he told fellow Republicans that the GOP must commit
itself to fighting racial injustice.
   ``We must acknowledge our party failed to provide the leadership
it should have in the civil rights movement of the '60s,'' Quayle
said. ``We are the party of Lincoln. We are the party of equality.''
   Quayle also delved into Massachusetts politics and said
Republicans have a chance to end a one-party system. He noted that
in his home state of Indiana, Republicans lost the governor's seat
in 1988 after holding the office for 20 years.
   ``If the Democrats can do that in the state of Indiana, the
Republicans can do it to the Democrats in the state of
Massachusetts,'' Quayle said.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis is not seeking re-election this year, and
the race for his seat has attracted a number of conservative
Democrats, as well as several GOP candidates. Among Repubublicans,
former U.S. Attorney William Weld, state House Minority Leader
Steven Pierce and former Rep. Paul Cronin are vying for the
governor's seat. Boston University President John Silber, Lt. Gov.
Evelyn Murphy and former state Attorney General Francis Bellotti
are seeking the Democratic nomination.
   Earlier in the day when he visited the Our Lady of Perpetual
Help grammar school, Quayle told students to think of the recent
space shuttle mission and urged them to commit themselves to
furthering America's role in space exploration.
   Quayle also congratulated a first-grade class for showing how to
pronounce and spell his name. ``You are way ahead of the majority
of the people in this country,'' he said.
   The students asked Quayle if he had a favorite book when he was
a student and he said he read a lot of Hardy Boys mysteries.
   When asked if his job was difficult, he said ``I wouldn't call
it a hard job.''
   He said that while his job has many responsibilities, ``it's
easy in one aspect, it's very easy to work with President Bush.''

<HEAD>Atlantic City Mayor Seeks Re-Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor James L. Usry, who faces
arraignment next week on charges he accepted $6,500 in bribes,
announced Monday he will seek a third term.
   Usry, who has spoken little in public since his July 27 arrest,
said he is confident of victory in the May 8 non-partisan election,
despite the bribery charges.
   ``There is an urgent need for the most qualified person to act
in the interests _ the best interests _ of Atlantic City,'' said
Usry, flanked by his wife and supporters at a crowded City Hall
news conference. ``I am that person.''
   He pointed to redevelopment in the blighted Inlet section of the
city and his role on the state Casino Reinvestment Development
Authority as reasons why he should win re-election. Levies placed
on casino hotels are allocated by the authority toward city and
state projects.
   But Usry said he would not allow the state to control his
government, a reference to what some critics believe is the need
for the city, long suffering the taint of corruption, to come under
greater state supervision.
   ``We will not be subjected to a second-class position,'' he
said. ``We will share, but we will not be taken over.''
   One supporter at the news conference said the charges lodged
against the mayor may actually help him marshal support in black
neighborhoods.
   ``He's made a great effort to turn this city around,'' said
community activist Omar Salahuddin. ``These charges are the same
kind of charges that black mayors across the country are facing.
   Usry was indicted Jan. 3 on charges of conspiracy, official
misconduct, bribery, gifts to public servants and violating the
state campaign contribution law. The mayor, who will turn 68 Feb.
2, reiterated Monday he is innocent until proven guilty.
   Usry is accused of accepting $6,000 in cash and a $500 check to
back an ordinance change that would allow a motorized business on
the Boardwalk. Usry has said the money was for a charitable
fund-raiser.
   Scheduled along with three others for arraignment Jan. 29, Usry
faces up to 36 years in prison and $315,000 in fines if convicted
of all charges.
   Eleven others, including the city council president and two city
councilmen, were arraigned two weeks ago in a probe of alleged
municipal corruption.
   Usry, president of the National Conference of Black Mayors,
became mayor in 1984 after he defeated incubant Michael Matthews in
a recall election. Matthews is now serving a 15-year sentence for
extortion. Usry was re-elected in 1986.

   Officials in charge of the 5-month-old savings
and loan bailout are coming under increasing pressure to act more
quickly on what amounts to the largest thrift institution and real
estate sale in history.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., created Aug. 9 when President Bush
signed the bailout legislation, hit the ground running with an
initial flurry of action. Within two months, it had disposed of 33
failed S&amp;Ls out of the 262 it inherited.
   But, in the three months since then, it's disposed of only seven
and its portfolio of failed S&amp;Ls is growing faster than its list of
resolutions.
   At the end of last week, it had sold a total of 40 institutions,
but still held 302 institutions with assets totaling $113 billion.
And, in coming months, it expects to take control of an additional
200 bankrupt thrifts.
   The House Banking Committee on Tuesday opens three days of
hearings into the administration's conduct of the bailout. The
Senate Banking Committee is following with a fourth session next
Monday.
   Legislators and analysts are criticizing the administration for
not doing more, a marked contrast from the generally favorable
reception bailout officials received during the last big round of
congressional oversight hearings in October.
   ``Speed is crucial,'' said Professor Paul Horvitz of the
University of Houston. ``These insolvent institutions are losing
money. ... But, much more important than that ... is they're also
affecting the market and imposing losses on solvent institutions.''
   Democrats on the banking panel are faulting Resolution Trust
Corp. officials for being too afraid of the kind of withering
criticism that hamstrung and ultimately forced the resignation of
M. Danny Wall, who as chairman of the now defunct Federal Home Loan
Bank Board handled the disposal of 223 institutions in 1988.
   ``It's a politically charged area and they're being extremely,
perhaps overly, cautious,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a
member of the banking committee. ``They're very troubled and
worried about doing anything and often the bureaucratic response to
that is: Don't just stand there, do nothing.''
   ``The message we have to get across is: inaction is not an
alternative,'' said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., who heads a House
task force overseeing the bailout. ``We didn't appoint them to be
in a popularity contest. We appointed them to do a job.''
   Critics also cite the cumbersome administrative structure
created by the S&amp;L bill.
   Policy and purse strings are controlled by a board chaired by
the secretary of the treasury. However, the corporation's work is
supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., an independent
agency that insures bank and S&amp;L deposits.
   ``There's a fundamental structural problem,'' said Bert Ely, a
financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va. ``Ultimately,
who's in charge?''
   L. William Seidman, who is chairman of both the FDIC and
Resolution Trust Corp., conceded that the administrative structure
has slowed the cleanup process, but he stressed the enormity of the
agency's task.
   ``You're setting up a new organization that had zero employees
five months ago. Already it's the equivalent of the second-largest
financial institution (after Citicorp) in the country,'' he said.
   This month, the corporation put 51 of its institutions on the
auction block, bringing the total for sale up to 70. It also
released a 3,000-page inventory of 30,000 pieces of real estate
available in 45 states.
   ``We want to do things rapidly, but we also want to do things
right,'' Seidman said. ``Overall ... I think our crew has
accomplished quite a bit.''
   The corporation hopes to complete the sales in the second
quarter, but after that says it will face a cash crunch if the
administration and Congress cannot resolve the politically sticky
question of how to raise working capital for the agency.
   The S&amp;L bill provided $50 billion to cover losses in insolvent,
but still open, thrifts. But, the corporation needs an additional
$40 billion to $100 billion in working capital. It would be repaid
as the government sells assets from the failed S&amp;Ls and would not
increase the ultimate cost of the bailout.
   ``They need more money and they need it sooner rather than
later,'' said Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, a policy
research group in Washington that sometimes advocates liberal
positions. ``The problem is the uncertainty over the budget
treatment.''
   The administration wants to avoid inflating the budget deficit.
But, congressional Democrats argue that it's is cheapest to borrow
the money through the Treasury, which would count toward the
deficit. So far, no one has come up with a compromise that will
satisfy both sides.

   President Bush's spokesman said Monday that
Americans are entitled to differing views on abortion based on
their ``personal choice of conscience.'' At the same time, Bush was
telling anti-abortion marchers he stands with them.
   White House aides sought to play down the significance of the
emotion-charged subject as an election-year issue, as well as
reports of divisions on the subject within the Bush family itself.
   ``We all feel there is room within the (Republican) party for
varying points of view on this issue,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the
president's spokesman.
   He said that Bush's own anti-abortion view was ``a personal
choice of conscience he has made'' and that the president ``urges
others to consider their conscience and principles in making their
own personal judgments.''
   As to a report in this week's Newsweek magazine that the Bush
family discovered at a recent family gathering that it was split on
the abortion issue, with Bush and his wife disagreeing, Fitzwater
said such a meeting never took place.
   Despite longstanding speculation that Barbara Bush retains the
pro-choice position Bush himself once espoused, Fitzwater said,
``The president said no such meeting ever took place.''
   Mrs. Bush repeatedly has refused to answer interviewers'
questions about her views on the abortion issue.
   In a year in which many analysts see a rigid anti-abortion
stance as a political liability, Bush limited his contact with the
marchers to a 90-second speech by remote telephone hookup. He spoke
to the marchers as they prepared for their annual march past the
Capitol and the Supreme Court.
   ``Let me assure you that this president stands with you on this
issue of life,'' Bush told the marchers on the 17th annivesary of
the court's Roe vs. Wade decision, which legalized abortion.
   ``For 17 years, the March for Life has served as a poignant
reminder to all Americans that human life in all its forms must be
respected. And I think all of you know my deep conviction on Roe
vs. Wade,'' Bush said.
   Although Bush said in 1980 that he believed the Roe vs. Wade
decison was ``right,'' he now supports a constitutional amendment
to overturn the ruling.
   He opposes abortion except to save the mother's life or in cases
of rape or incest. Bush opposes federal financing of abortions for
poor women except to save the mother's life.
   Fitzwater, asked at his daily news briefing whether Bush shares
Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater's view that there is
enough room in the GOP for both those who oppose and those who
favor abortion rights, Fitzwater said: ``Yes, he does.''
   ``We welcome Republicans being Republicans. And they're free. We
have people of independent belief and thought here,'' he said.
   Newsweek reported that Bush and his wife discussed abortion at a
recent get-together with their children and their children's
spouses and found all the men were anti-abortion but all the women
were pro-choice, said the magazine. It did name its source.
   Mrs. Bush's press secretary, Anna Perez, echoed Fitzwater's
denial that any such meeting took place.
   ``It did not happen as reported,'' she said.
   Furthermore, Ms. Perez said that Mrs. Bush ``has a longstanding
policy of not commenting on controversial issues. She does not want
to defuse the ability she has to focus public opinion on those
areas where she can make a difference: literacy, teen pregnancy,
hunger. ...''

<HEAD>More Price Rises Likely for Milk, U.S. Economist Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices of milk and other dairy
products may well rise again this year but not at the pace of 1989,
an Agriculture Department economist said Monday.
   Ralph Parlett of the department's Economic Research Service said
1990 retail prices of dairy products could rise as much as 3
percent, compared with an average gain of 6.6 percent in 1989.
   A few weeks ago, Parlett figured dairy product prices might go
up in a range of 1 percent to 2 percent this year. But now, he said
in a telephone interview, the increase could be more volatile,
ranging from zero to 3 percent.
   Consumer food prices generally are expected to rise 3 percent to
5 percent in 1990, according to a forecast announced by USDA last
fall. The 1989 average was up almost 6 percent, the sharpest gain
since 1981.
   Parlett said he is sticking by the 3 percent to 5 percent
forecast, at least for the present.
   In an outlook report by the USDA agency, economists said dairy
markets ``are adjusting after the record prices and chaotic
conditions of last autumn.''
   The report said dairy prices at the farm and wholesale will drop
in the first half of 1990 because of cutbacks in non-fat dry milk
exports, likely increases in milk production, and consumer reaction
to higher prices.
   Another factor will be seasonal increases in milk output, the
``flush'' season of spring when production is at a peak. By then,
the report said, most wholesale prices are likely to be below a
year earlier.

<TEXT>
   The sexual mutilation of a 7-year-old
boy so inflamed Tacoma residents that a judge went more than 100
miles north Monday to pick a jury that hasn't formed opinions from
pretrial publicity.
   Between 80 and 90 people showed up Monday in the start of jury
selection for the trial in Tacoma of Earl Kenneth Shriner, a
40-year-old ex-convict with a 24-year history of attacks on young
people.
   Shriner has pleaded innocent to charges he raped and choked the
boy and cut off his penis on May 20. The boy, now 8 and back in
school, will testify.
   The crime is one of several violent sex crimes recently in
Washington state which have sparked proposed legislation to snare
more sex predators and keep them in jail longer.
   In addition to pretrial publicity, Pierce County Superior Court
Judge Tom Sauriol also cited a number of death threats against
Shriner in moving jury selection. He initially refused to tell the
news media about the move until ordered to by the state Supreme
Court.
   When asked Monday if there had been a lot of threats, Sauriol
said, ``I don't know what you'd call an awful lot. There has been
an awful lot that's scary.''
   Barbara Corey-Boulet, Pierce County deputy prosecuting attorney,
said there had been more death threats in this case than in any
case she'd every been associated with.
   When potential jurors were asked how many had heard of the
Shriner case, almost everyone raised their hands. A few raised
their hands when asked if they or someone they talked to had
expressed an opinion about the case.
   Shriner sat expressionless during the proceedings.
   No one was to be excused from possible jury duty until lawyers
for both sides study the results of a 12-page, 55-question
questionnaire potential jurors were asked to fill out after
orientation Monday.
   Jury selection was expected to take about a week and the trial,
set to start in Tacoma on Jan. 29, about three weeks. Jurors will
be sequestered, Sauriol said.
   Prosecutors have said they would seek a life sentence for
Shriner, who completed a 10-year prison term shortly before the
attack on the boy for kidnap and assault of two teen-age girls.
   Shriner has been held in lieu of $1 million bail.
   No Washington county has been immune from the sex crimes
fallout. A governor's task force held hearings throughout the state
before drafting a $17 million package of proposed legislation to
toughen sex-offender sentences and create a civil procedure to
indefinitely commit highly violent offenders after they have served
their criminal sentences.

   With the late afternoon sun casting long
shadows at Arlington National Cemetery, former Justice Arthur J.
Goldberg was buried Monday beside his wife and near the grave of
Chief Justice Earl Warren, under whom he served on the Supreme
Court.
   Retired Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and six of the eight associate justices were among
mourners at private Jewish services in the Fort Myer Memorial
Chapel, but did not come to the gravesite.
   Lt. Cmdr. Eric S. Renne, an Air Force chaplain, presented the
flag from the casket to Goldberg's son, Robert Goldberg of
Anchorage, Alaska. By Robert Goldberg's side was his sister,
Barbara Goldberg Cramer of Chicago.
   Goldberg's wife, Dorothy, died in February 1988. Their gravesite
lies between that of Warren and that of Secretary of State John
Foster Dulles in a hilltop area of the cemetery across the Potomac
River from Washington.
   Goldberg and his wife were entitled to burial in Arlington
because of his service as an Air Force colonel.
   Rabbi Stanley Rabinowitz conducted the graveside service, an Air
Force firing party fired three volleys and Staff Sgt. Joel C.
Guyton of Bolling Air Force Base, Wash., played ``Taps.''
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Anthony Kennedy did not attend.
Retired Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. was also absent. Powell and
Burger are the only surviving retired members of the court.
   Goldberg, who served on the high court from 1962 until his
resignation in 1965 to become U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, died of coronary artery disease Friday at his home in
Washington. He was 81.
   He came to Washington as President John F. Kennedy's first
secretary of labor in 1961 after a career as a union lawyer.
   Kennedy named him to the Supreme Court on the retirement of the
ailing Justice Felix Frankfurter.
   He left the court when President Lyndon B. Johnson persuaded him
to accept the United Nations post left vacant by the death of Adlai
E. Stevenson. Johnson appointed Abe Fortas to succeed him on the
court.
   Goldberg resigned from the U.N. position in 1968, and was the
unsuccessful Democratic nominee for governor of New York against
incumbent Republican Nelson Rockefeller in 1970.
   He practiced law in Washington and served on public commissions
and as an arbitrator until shortly before his death.

<HEAD>Bush Will Nominate Kolstad as NTSB Chairman</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Monday that he will
nominate James Kolstad as chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, ending a 17-month stalemate over leadership of the
agency that investigates air, sea and land transportation accidents.
   Kolstad, 50, a former airline executive, has been a member of
the safety board since 1987 and its acting chairman since August
1988 when Jim Burnett failed to win Senate approval for a fourth
two-year term as chairman.
   White House action on the nomination had been delayed while
Kolstad underwent an extended background check, including scrutiny
of his interim stewardship of the agency.
   The board has been beset with bickering and other difficulties,
exacerbated by a tight budget and shrinking investigative staff.
Board member Joseph Tribbe Nall was killed Nov. 28 in a plane crash
in Caracas, Venezuela, where he had gone to give a speech.
   ``This long interim has been destabilizing and it's good that
the issue has been resolved,'' said Stephen Hayes, vice president
of the Air Transport Association, which represents the major
airlines. ``We think he's certainly well-qualified and will be a
very effective chairman of the board.''
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., the chairman of the
Senate aviation subcommittee, said he was pleased with Bush's move.
   ``I believe Mr. Kolstad has the necessary background,
qualifications and temperament to serve in this capacity. Mr.
Kolstad will continue to promote the smooth operation of the board
and I look forward to working with him as chairman,'' Ford said.
   An aide to Ford said the panel will schedule confirmation
hearings on both Kolstad and Susan Coughlin, a Bush nominee whose
appointment to the board languished last year without a hearing.
   Kolstad was a White House aide and presidential advance man
during the Nixon administration. He was director of congressional
relations for the old Civil Aeronautics Board from 1973-78 and
later served as public affairs director for Frontier Airlines.

<TEXT>
   Consumer Product Safety Commission staff
members say adult sleepwear should be labeled according to its
degree of flammability to help prevent fire deaths among the
elderly. Manufacturers argue that a simple warning would do the job.
   The commission will soon consider staff and industry
recommendations for adult sleepwear labeling after postponing a
vote on the issue Monday.
   ``We want to provide the consumer with information on relative
flammability to build safety into making a choice,'' said James
Hoebel, head of the CPSC fire hazard and burn prevention division.
   Hoebel's staff has recommended the commission require labeling
that would classify adult pajamas, nightgowns and robes by degree
of fabric flammability.
   ``I don't quarrel with their intent,'' said Larry K. Martin,
government relations director for the American Apparel
Manufacturers Association.
   ``They want to provide some added safety to elderly people but
you can't segregate nightwear for elderly people from what you and
I wear,'' added Martin.
   According to the CPSC, there were 179 clothing fire deaths in
1986, the last year for which figures are available. Adults aged 65
and older were victims in all but 40 of those incidents and the
clothing most frequently involved was sleepwear, said Hoebel.
   ``We're very concerned about trying to prevent those deaths,''
said CPSC spokesman Ken Giles.
   But Martin said a simple flammability warning would accomplish
the same goal as a complex system of fabric testing and rating.
   ``We've recommended to the commission that they require a
warning label that has a logo with a strike through it and a flame
and language that says `Warning: Keep away from flame and other
ignition source,''' Martin said.
   Labels are not required for children's sleepwear but garments
must meet a flammability performance standard that measures how
quickly a garment stops burning.
   CPSC testing includes burning with an open flame at least five
10-by-3-inch swatches from a garment. No sample can burn more than
seven inches before it stops burning and no one swatch can burn its
full length for a garment to satisfy the government standard.
   The American Association of Retired Persons, a lobbying group
for the elderly, prefers a performance standard but would back a
classification system and a mandatory labeling program, AARP
volunteer James Ryan told the commission last week.

   The wife of a cult leader pleaded
innocent Monday to 15 counts of helping him and some of his
followers kill a family of five last spring.
   Alice Lundgren, wearing handcuffs and shackled at the ankles,
appeared somber at her arraignment, other than to smile faintly at
another jail inmate brought to court.
   A judge set bond at $250,000 after a prosecutor expressed
concern Mrs. Lundgren might flee if released from the Lake County
Jail.
   She and her husband, Jeffrey Lundgren, were arrested with their
19-year-old son, Damon, earlier this month in Southern California.
   ``The state has information and believes that had this defendant
been successful in delivering her minor children to relatives, she
and her husband would have fled into Mexico,'' Lake County
prosecutor Steven C. LaTourette told Common Pleas Judge James W.
Jackson.
   Mrs. Lundgren, 39, pleaded innocent to five counts of complicity
to aggravated murder, five counts of conspiracy to commit
aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping in the shooting
deaths last April of Dennis Avery, his wife, Cheryl, and their
three daughters, aged 15, 13 and 7.
   The bodies of the family were found Jan. 3-4 buried under a barn
on a farm near Cleveland where Lundgren and his small band of
followers lived for a time.
   Authorities have speculated the deaths may have been a religious
sacrifice. The Averys were among Lundgren's followers.
   Lundgren is a former lay minister for the Reorganized Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Kirtland. In January 1988, he
was defrocked after church leaders said he espoused radical beliefs
and used his position as a tour guide at a church temple to recruit
believers.
   Lundgren and his son each are charged with five counts of
aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping. They are fighting
extradition from California to Ohio.
   Eight other cult members were arrested this month in the case.
Charges against them range from aggravated murder to kidnapping.
   Kay Sunday, lawyer for Mrs. Lundgren in San Diego, said last
week the couple's three younger children were staying with Mrs.
Lundgren's mother in Missouri.

   Police spraying foam from water cannons dispersed
a rally Monday night of people demanding the parliament of this
Persian Gulf emirate be reinstated, witnesses reported.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman said five people were arrested
``after trying to resist security men and prevent them from
carrying out their duty'' and that one tried to attack police with
a knife.
   No estimate was available of the size of the crowd at
Farnawaniya, 10 miles south of Kuwait city.
   The official Kuwaiti News Agency said the crowd gathered without
permission at the home of Abbas Munawer, a member of the parliament
dissolved in 1986.
   ``Despite several warnings ... to disperse, they went ahead with
their plan, prompting security men to disperse them,'' it said.
   Activists said police sprayed foam on the crowd and cordoned off
the area.
   It was the fourth such meeting in two months to be declared
illegal and dispersed by force. It occurred less than 48 hours
after the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, said he favored a
functioning parliament but urged activists to stop protesting.
   He dismissed the 50-member parliament, the only elected
legislature in the Arab states around the Persian Gulf, because of
harsh criticism of the government by members. Iran was at war with
Iraq in 1986 and was threatening military action against Kuwait.
   Iran and Iraq agreed to a truce in August 1988 and supporters of
greater democracy in Kuwait want the parliament reconvened.
   Pro-democracy activists collected 25,000 signatures on a
petition, but the emir has refused to accept it.

   President Bush is weighing a plan to elevate
the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet status after the
idea won the backing of several key White House staffers, his
spokesman said Monday.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said a bipartisan
congressional proposal to make the EPA the 15th Cabinet agency is
under serious consideration for White House backing.
   ``One of the selling points is that it could have managerial
advantages for the agency. The EPA's in kind of a unique situation
where it's part regulatory, part policy,'' Fitzwater said.
``Several members of the staff are receptive to the idea, but there
has been no final decison yet.''
   A bipartisan bill to make the EPA a Cabinet agency is expected
to be introduced when Congress returns this week from its winter
recess. Fitzwater said that White House aides have had discussions
with congressional sponsors of the measure, but no commitment was
given.
   The New York Times reported in Monday editions that Bush had
reversed his previous opposition to expanding the Cabinet, and was
ready to accept the outcome of a congressional vote on the proposal
_ although would not initiate the plan himself.
   Fitzwater disputed that, however, saying Bush ``doesn't have a
personal position at this time. No decision has been made.''
   Previously, Bush has said he did not support any increases in
the size of the Cabinet.
   ``We'd like not to expand the Cabinet, but occasionally we may
come up with reasons why we'd want to change our mind,'' said
Fitzwater, who worked in the EPA office of public affairs from 1972
to 1981.
   The Cabinet was last expanded in 1988, before Bush took office,
with the addition of the Department of Veterans Affairs, formerly
the Veterans Administration.
   The president has emphasized environmental issues in his first
year in office, including calling for tough new clean-air
legislation. He also is expected to propose an increase in funds
for environmental programs in the fiscal 1991 budget he submits to
Congress next Monday.
   The EPA was created in 1970 in an executive order by President
Nixon.
   Bills were introduced last year to add the EPA to the Cabinet,
but did not make it to the floor of either the House or Senate.
   Among legislators backing the idea are Sens. David Durenberger,
R-Minn., John Chafee, R-R.I., and Bill Bradley and Frank
Lautenberg, both New Jersey Democrats.

<HEAD>Walesa Meets With Reform Communist Before Party Congress in Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa met Monday with a potential
leader of the reformed communist party as Polish communists begged
the Solidarity-led government for protection from ``revenge''
before holding their last congress.
   Walesa, a founder and leader of Solidarity, conferred with
communist Tadeusz Fiszbach, a deputy speaker of parliament who was
ousted as Gdansk party leader after the 1981 martial-law crackdown
here for his Solidarity sympathies.
   Fiszbach has not said if he will bid to head the new party
expected to emerge when the Polish United Workers Party _ the
communist party _ is dissolved during its 11th national congress
opening Saturday .
   The only announced candidate is Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, the
current first secretary who seeks to bolster the party's dwindling
role in Polish politics with a new name and program.
   ``If the slogans and ideas that Mr. Fiszbach represents were
valid during the last 10 years, we would surely be further in
reforming Poland,'' Walesa said after the meeting.
   He called Fiszbach ``a man of reconciliation,'' and the
communist said, ``There are common issues that do not divide us but
unite us.''
   The two men did not indicate any agreement, however, on a major
issue: whether the buildings, industries and other property
accumulated by the communist party during 45 years of total power
should be reclaimed for the public treasury.
   Walesa said the party's assets are ``public property.''
   ``One should not have an emotional approach,'' Fiszbach said.
``I think the government should take up the issue and should
consider the needs of newly created parties and the newly elected
local governments.''
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and his Solidarity-dominated
Cabinet have stopped government subsidies to political parities
without moving to regain the property.
   But there is considerable public demand to go further. Up for
consideration Thursday is a draft law submitted by 93 parliament
members who want to take back party property.
   The party congress' coordinating committee protested Monday, and
asked the government ``to guarantee us the elementary right to hold
our congress.''
   ``An attempt to confiscate communist party property on the eve
of its ending its life impedes the shaping of a rational
arrangement of political forces in the country,'' delegates said in
a statement carried by the party daily Trybuna Ludu.
   ``At the decisive moment, we are becoming the focus of a
propaganda and political attack.
   ``In a climate of aggression, there are attempts at revenge in a
style that we assess as a relic of the past. Recently, the slogan
of nationalizing communist party property became the pretext for
the attacks.''
   A commentary in Trybuna Ludu said parliament's adoption of the
measure would be ``a revengeful abuse of freshly won power'' and
``end the short period of democracy in Poland.''
   It said nationalizing party property would reinforce the
arguments of the hard-liners and be a ``political blow at the
reform-oriented current in the party.''
   Over the weekend, Parliament began dismantling Poland's vast
cooperative system, attacked as a monopolistic, bureaucratic
vestige of communist power that must be pared down and opened to
competition.
   The lawmakers, backed by the government, voted to dissolve the
Central Cooperative Unions, the top tier of a system that funneled
small producers' wares into a network of distributers ultimately
regulated by supreme councils.
   ``Does a shoemaker in the countryside really need a chief
manager in Warsaw?'' Deputy Urszula Jarosz asked during the debate,
the official news agency PAP reported.
   The new law will remove regulations and restrictions imposed on
producers by the Central Cooperative Unions as part of radical
economic reforms that aim to turn Poland's staggering socialist
economy into one driven by market forces.
   ``Adoption of the draft law will break up the old structures ..
. and will encourage grass-roots initiative,'' PAP quoted Deputy
Marian Kowal as saying.

<TEXT>
   A woman who says she stopped wearing
slacks to work due to her religious beliefs will challenge her
dismissal by her employer, who says trousers are safer on the job.
   The lawsuit, filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission on Bonnie Mai Owen's behalf, goes before U.S. District
Judge Thomas Wiseman Jr. on Wednesday.
   ``I am a member of the Apostolic Pentecostal Church,'' Ms. Owen,
of Culleoka, said in a statement filed with the court. ``My church
teaches, and I believe for religious reasons, that it is wrong for
women to wear slacks.''
   Heil-Quaker officials say they have an unwritten dress code
requiring all employees to wear trousers for safety reasons, and
that Ms. Owen was informed of this policy during orientation.
   The company, whose Lewisburg plant makes sheet metal components
for residential heating and cooling systems, claims dresses might
get caught in machinery.
   Lee Fortier, a safety inspector hired by the EEOC, said the
slow-moving assembly line on which Ms. Owen worked poses little
danger. He said loose shirttails and carpenter-type aprons worn by
many male employees pose as much hazard as a dress.
   Ms. Owen wore slacks to work for nearly three years before
reporting for work Feb. 19, 1986, in a skirt. She said she was told
to go home and change clothes and was fired the next day after she
refused.

   The Bush administration cautioned the Soviet
Union on Monday against suppressing peaceful political expression
while quelling violence in Azerbaijan.
   It also urged Moscow to undertake ``a political dialogue'' with
all peoples in the embattled republic.
   ``We hope for an early end to all bloodshed,'' the State
Department said. ``We hope that reason and restraint will mark the
actions of all parties to the dispute.''
   Strife between Azeris and Armenians prompted Moscow to dispatch
troops to the region last week. Department spokeswoman Margaret D.
Tutwiler said 83 people were killed in Baku, the capital of the
republic, over the past two days and that this toll ``is sure to
rise.''
   She said she could not confirm reports from Moscow that the
troops had managed to take control of the city. Again, the U.S.
spokeswoman deplored the ethnic violence that has plagued the
region.
   Last week, the State Department supported Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's use of troops to try to restore order and
criticized feuding Azeris and Armenians for ``revisiting old ethnic
hatreds.''
   Shifting gears slightly, Tuesday's statement stressed that U.S.
support for Moscow in using force was limited.
   ``There is a fundamental difference between the short-term use
of force to restore order and the use of force to suppress peaceful
and legitimate political expression,'' Ms. Tutwiler said, reading
from a prepared statement.
   ``We hope to see the early creation of conditions in which a
political dialogue can be undertaken,'' it said. ``Such a dialogue
must accommodate the aspirations of all the peoples in the
republics.''
   Asked if the Soviet Union was using force to suppress dissent,
Ms. Tutwiler replied: ``No, we are not saying that.''
   The spokeswoman said Soviet troops along the border with Iran
had been augmented to prevent ``unauthorized access.'' Ms. Tutwiler
said she had nothing to say about reports that Iran was aiding the
Azeris with equipment.
   Most Azeris and Iranians are Moslems while Armenians are
predominantly Christians.
   ``We deplore the ethnic violence that has plagued the region,''
Ms. Tutwiler said. ``We deeply regret the loss of life in Baku.''

   Haiti's ambassador to the United States
resigned on Monday in protest against the ``repeated violations of
human rights'' by his country's military government.
   Ambassador Pierre Francois Benoit told a news conference that
the Haitian government has described itself as provisional but ``in
my view is becoming permanent.''
   In a etter to the nation's military leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril, Benoit said, ``In view of repeated violations of human
rights in our country, which culimated in the events which
transpired this weekend, I cannot continue to serve as your
administration's ambassador to the United States and to the
Organization of American States.''
   He said his decision was triggered primarily by the government's
decision to send several political leaders into exile. He plans to
return to his former employer, General Motors, where he worked
before assuming his duties as ambassador a year ago.
   Meanwhile, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler also
criticized the crackdown in Haiti.
   ``By suspending four articles of the constitution, declaring
state of siege, and arresting a number of political leaders, the
government has put at risk the democratic transition in Haiti,''
she said.
   ``Especially disturbing is the deportation without charges,
evidence or due process of responsible democratic opposition
leaders. Such actions undermine the confidence that candidates and
voters must have in order to participate in a credible electoral
process.''
   She called on the government to move quickly to rescind the
measures taken over the weekend and to restore faith in the
democratic process.

   President Bush cautioned Monday against
``quick-fix solutions'' to problems such as homelessness, drug
abuse, crime and education.
   More government spending is not the answer, Bush said in remarks
prepared for a dinner sponsored by the conservative American
Spectator magazine.
   He called for a renewal of dedication to the institutions of
church, family and community and ``to the fundamental ideals of
free government.''
   ``With all the flash and fluff in the world today, there's
something we can't afford to lose sight of _ something deceptively
simple: It's who we are that makes this nation what it is,'' Bush
said. ``We need to look beyond superficial, quick-fix solutions.''
   The president said the 1990s would be an ``ideal time to renew
our vows and our values, time to look beyond the next paycheck and
the next personal problem. ... We simply have to remember that the
American adventure isn't over; it's just begun.''
   He praised the magazine, saying ``our nation's intellectual life
would be more than a little poorer without the American Spectator
surveying the scene.''
   ``Your critical eye helps helps us see beneath the surface _
beyond the intellectual fads and fashions of the day _ to the ideas
and the enduring values that really matter in our society.''

   Police and education officials kicked off
Monday an anti-drug program sponsored by Kiwanis International that
teaches school children the dangers of drug use.
   ``We teach them the reasons to say no _ that it can kill you _
with questions like `What is an alcoholic?' and `Are cigarettes
dope?'' said Kiwanian Bob Galloway, a leader of the project.
   ``Operation KNOW'' has been started in 12 cities as a follow-up
on Nancy Reagan's ``Just Say No'' campaign.
   The program costs the Kiwanis about $3 per child and provides
them with such materials as a ``Know to Say No'' board game,
T-shirts, headbands and pledges that youngsters sign promising to
be drug- and alcohol-free.
   The pledges go to first lady Barbara Bush, and the children are
to receive response cards from the White House.
   Other cities taking part in the program are New York, St. Louis,
Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Detroit, Atlanta, Houston,
Indianapolis, Harrisburg, Pa., and Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>Opposition Demand End to Communist Rule, Probe of Secret Police</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders meeting with ruling
communist officials demanded quicker reforms to eliminate Communist
Party influence in the government and workplace, and called for an
investigation of the secret police.
   Also Monday, the newspaper Pogled reported that ousted Stalinist
leader Todor Zhivkov, 78, arrested last week, faces a maximum of 30
years in jail if convicted on a single count _ misappropriation of
state property.
   ``Todor Zhivkov's repressive system has not ceased to exist; we
are its hostages,'' said Zhelyu Zhelev, chairman of the 12-party
opposition Union of Democratic Forces, quoted by the state news
agency BTA.
   Zhelev called for a speedup of democratization because of a
``possible adverse turn of events in the Soviet Union'' where
unrest is wracking several of its republics and because of the need
for Western economic aid, BTA said.
   The opposition says reform has been slow in coming since Zhivkov
was deposed Nov. 10 in a wave of pro-democracy uprisings that swept
Eastern Europe last year. Communist leader and President Petar
Mladenov, who replaced Zhivkov, has pledged widespread reform and
free elections by May.
   Politburo member Andrei Lukanov, leader of the Communist Party
delegation, said, ``I deeply trust the Communist Party of the
Soviet Union's ability to take the country out of the difficult
stage,'' he said, apparently referring to the separatist movements
that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is facing.
   Without the Soviet Union's cooperation Bulgaria would be unable
to find its way out of its economic difficulties, BTA quoted
Lukanov as saying.
   Opposition spokesmen at the negotiating table demanded that the
Communist Party cells be removed from the workplace and urged that
activities of the Committee for State Security be examined at a
public inquiry, BTA said.
   The opposition also wants the army, the Interior Ministry, the
law courts and the prosecutor's office to be ``depoliticized,''
meaning freed of influence by the ruling Communist Party and other
parties.
   Opposition representatives also demanded disclosure of property
of the Communist and Agrarian parties and of high-ranking officials
in Bulgaria's ``nomenklatura,'' BTA said.
   They demanded the lifting of customs controls on the import of
literature, the news agency said.
   The leadership was scheduled to answer the opposition demands on
Tuesday.
   The opposition has received the green light to issue an
independent newspaper, which will be titled Democracy, but the
government has so far rejected a demand for opposition access to
the media. The disagreement held up the talks last week.
   According to the Panorama weekend television program, Zhivkov
was at his Boyana residence on the slopes of Mt. Vitosha south of
Sofia until Jan. 19 when he was taken into custody.
   The report quoted the Interior Ministry as saying Zhivkov was
being held ``in a place specially adjusted for the purpose'' of
investigative custody. There was no elaboration.
   Conviction of the crime of illegally ``receiving an especially
large amount of public property'' could draw a sentence of 10 to 30
years in jail, said Pogled.
   The other charge _ ``inciting ethnic hostility and hatred'' _
carries a maximum of three years. The third charge _ ``an
especially grave case of abuse of power'' _ is punishable by
imprisonment of three to 10 years.

   NAACP leaders said Monday after a meeting with
President Bush there may be ``some movements'' in the effort to
find the terrorists responsible for mail bombings in the South.
   Their assessment came as FBI agents searched a warehouse in
Enterprise, Ala., in an action a spokesman said ``could very well''
be linked to the bombing investigation.
   Dr. William F. Gibson, a Greenville, S.C., dentist and chairman
of the NAACP board of directors, said after meeting with Bush,
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and FBI Director William Sessions:
``We got indications that there are some movements in the cases. I
can't say anything further.''
   NAACP Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks said, ``We were
fairly well satisfied that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
the Justice Department were doing their best.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thornburgh ``simply
said that we were making progress, that he was hopeful, but he
could not give any specifics at that point.''
   Mail bombs claimed the lives of a federal appeals judge in
Alabama and a Savannah, Ga., civil rights lawyers in November.
Other bombs were mailed to the federal courthouse in Atlanta and
the NAACP branch office in Jacksonville, Fla., but were intercepted
before exploding.
   Among the 17 NAACP officials at the White House meeting were
Willye Dennis, head of the Jacksonville office, and Erl Shinhoster,
director of its Atlanta regional office, where a tear gas bomb
exploded last Aug. 21.
   Hooks, who also met with Bush on Jan. 9 to discuss the attacks,
said, ``We are concerned about the climate ... that has caused race
relations to deteriorate, and increased acts of violence.''
   He suggested that last week's arrest of District of Columbia
Mayor Marion Barry on cocaine charges _ not discussed at the White
House meeting _ may be part of a pattern of `undue harassment'' of
black elected officials, and part of ``the rising tide of racism in
this nation.''
   Hooks said the Ku Klux Klan and Skinheads have picketed the
NAACP's national headquarters in Baltimore twice in recent weeks.
   ``We're concerned about the mood, the kind of relationships that
are developing schisms between blacks and whites in America,'' said
Gibson.
   ``We encouraged the president to use (his) office ... to get the
word over that we feel that there needs to be more relations and
negotiations and discussions between black America and white
America,'' said Gibson.
   They said they asked Bush and Thornburgh to use the Justice
Department's Community Relations Service and a revised U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights to promote such a dialogue. Bush was
``amicable'' toward those steps, Gibson said.
   Hooks said they did not discuss with the president the widely
publicized Barry arrest in a FBI sting operation in a Washington
hotel last Thursday.
   But Hooks said: ``There is no question about the fact that we at
the NAACP across the past few years have felt that there has been
undue emphasis on harassing black elected officials.''
   Thornburgh, asked later about the harassment charge, said, ``If
that were the case, it would be intolerable. It is not the case.''
   Hooks said newspaper accounts made it sound like ``the search
had finally paid off. We spent all of these years trying to find
him with a grain of cocaine, and by God we did it, didn't we?
   ``We haven't found all the people who've stolen all the money
from the savings and loan associations and are driving Rolls Royces
and Jaguars, so obviously many of us in the black community will
have some peculiar feelings as we go further.''
   Hooks was asked if he objected to bringing law-breakers to
justice.
   ``No, I think you ought to bring everybody to justice for
violating the law. That would have meant most of us here would be
arrested for speeding, spitting on the sidewalk or something. If we
can afford to do it, let's do it.
   Bush has said nothing of the Barry arrest, except that it was
``very sad.''

<HEAD>Italian Leaders Meet with Former King of Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian leaders met Monday with the former king of
Afghanistan for talks on the political situation in the war-torn
nation.
   Italian President Francesco Cossiga invited Mohammed Zaher Shah
for a new year's lunch, the president's office said in a statement.
Cossiga's spokesman, Ludovico Ortona, said Italian Premier Giulio
Andreotti and Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis also attended but
he refused to say what was discussed.
   However, a spokesman for the former king, Gen. Abdul Wali, said
there was an ``analysis of the situation in our country.'' He
described the atmosphere as ``cordial.''
   Wali refused to comment directly on reports that President Najib
of Afghanistan had agreed to turn over power to an interim
government led by the former king.
   ``Sharing power with the ... (Communist) party in Kabul has
always been something which is not acceptable,'' he said, adding
that the former king would ``accept any role or mission that the
Afghan people ... would bestow upon him.''
   The Soviet Union withdrew the last of its troops from
Afghanistan nearly a year after a decade-long effort to sustain
Marxist rule.
   There have been suggestions the former king could play a role in
a transitional government that would lead the country out of civil
war between the government and Moslem guerrillas.
   Zaher Shah, who suffers from rheumatism, was enjoying the
thermal spring waters of the Italian island of Ischia when his
cousin and former prime minister, Mohammed Daud, seized power in
July 1973. He has lived in Italy since then.
   Monday's lunch marked one of the rare occasions on which the
former king has appeared in public.

<HEAD>Abortion Anniversary Marked As States Debate New Rules</HEAD>

   Demonstrators marched with renewed fervor at state capitols and
cities around the nation Monday to commemorate the 17th anniversary
of the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade ruling, which legalized
abortion.
   At least 9,000 people marched against abortion at the Georgia
Capitol in Atlanta, while Washington's annual March for Life
carried a similar message to the White House, the nation's Capitol
and the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``It may be a long fight,'' the Rev. Pat Robertson told
demonstrators in Atlanta, ``(but) we will come back this year, we
will come back next year, we will come back the year after ...
until sooner or later we have victory.''
   Norma McCorvey, the woman who was the ``Jane Roe'' in Roe vs.
Wade, was keynote speaker at a pro-choice rally that drew about
1,000 people to the steps of the California Capitol in Sacramento.
   ``We're still fighting and will continue to fight as long as the
fight must go on,'' she said. ``The movement didn't start with me.
I was just the straw that broke the camel's back.''
   Sarah Weddington, the Texas lawyer who argued Ms. McCorvey's
case before the Supreme Court, told a breakfast in Dallas: ``We are
here to say we won 17 years ago today, and we will win again.''
   The Roe vs. Wade anniversary has become an increasingly
important day to those debating the future of abortion in the
United States. This year's commemoration carried special weight
because of last summer's Supreme Court ruling in Missouri's Webster
case.
   That ruling, which opened the door for states to impose some
restrictions on abortion, was the biggest legal victory in decades
for anti-abortion forces and led to speculation that the high court
would overturn Roe vs. Wade.
   It also pumped new life into organizations on both sides of the
abortion debate, and led to a flurry of legislative proposals to
both restrict and guarantee access to abortions.
   Those bills helped give added significance to this year's
demonstrations. Tens of thousands of people marched at rallies
around the nation on Sunday.
   The Webster case also provided a backdrop for one of the
stranger incidents in the abortion observances. On Sunday night,
police in San Francisco cited Ms. McCorvey for illegally posting
stickers bearing the name ``Roe'' on city street signs. The signs
were on Webster Street.
   ``It was just a prank,'' Ms. McCorvey told reporters Monday.
``We were plastering Webster signs, making them Roe signs.''
   In another unusual twist, about a dozen pro-choice demonstrators
wrapped 200 feet of purple ribbon around the Louisiana statehouse
in Baton Rouge to draw attention to their new Coalition for
Reproductive Freedom. The ribbon, they said, symbolized the purple
sashes worn by suffragettes who marched for women's rights earlier
in the century.
   In Charlotte, N.C., a Planned Parenthood chapter set up three
mobile telephones downtown for pro-choice supporters on their lunch
breaks to pay $3 to call Gov. Jim Martin and President Bush.
   Many people stopped to take leaflets, but a few placed calls.
   ``I'm pro-choice and I vote,'' Lyla Bendsen shouted into one of
the cellular phones as she called Martin's office over the sounds
of traffic.
   In Trenton, N.J., about 150 protesters marched in front of the
New Jersey statehouse in support of anti-abortion bills, including
one that would require minors seeking abortions to notify their
parents.
   The demonstrators included a group of schoolgirls from
Incarnation School in nearby Ewing, N.J., one of whom carried a
sign that read: ``Real Women Don't Kill Babies.''
   ``All of our parents gave us a chance, so why don't we give them
a chance,'' said another student, eighth-grader Theresa Thoma.
   A parental notification bill is also pending in Nebraska, where
the Legislature chose Monday's anniversary to begin its debate on
the issue. State lawmakers in Lincoln adjourned for the day without
voting.
   In Maine, about three-dozen anti-abortion demonstrators marched
on the federal courthouse in Portland, while their opposites
lobbied legislators in Augusta ``to keep Maine a pro-choice
state,'' in the words of pro-choice leader Betsy Sweet.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo appeared with Gloria Steinem, a
founder of the modern women's movement, at a conference of family
planning advocates in Albany.
   ``There is an uprising on the streets and in the voting booths
on this issue in this country, just as there was for democracy in
Eastern Europe,'' Ms. Steinem said.

   President Daniel Ortega said
U.S.-backed rebels had planned to ambush him in a remote northern
area where he campaigned for elections.
   No attack took place, and his claim could not be independently
confirmed.
   Ortega spoke at a political rally Sunday in San Juan de Rio
Coco, a small town in the northern province of Madriz, which
borders Honduras. A tape of his speech was provided to The
Associated Press.
   Ortega is running for re-election against Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro, the candidate of the U.S.-backed United National
Opposition. General elections are scheduled for Feb. 25.
   The leftist government has said the number of clashes with the
Contra rebels increased sharply this month. Ortega said in an
annual economic speech Monday that he would send a note protesting
the attacks to the U.S. government, the U.N. Security Council and
the Organization of American States.
   Ortega addressed a rally in Quilali, then left for San Juan de
Rio Coco.
   ``Now that we were coming from Quilali, they (Contras) tried to
stage an ambush on the road,'' Ortega said. ``And the comrades
(military commanders) were telling me, `It's not convenient to go
to San Juan de Rio Coco because the ambush could be waiting for
you.'
   ``But I told them, `Let's go.' ''
   There were no journalists with the president's caravan as it
traveled from Quilali to San Juan de Rio Coco. Journalists were
shuttled in a helicopter.
   ``Those Contras are lurking around there, threatening ... and in
some way they are threatening the president of Nicaragua and the
candidate of the Sandinista Front,'' Ortega said.
   ``Therefore it's the Yankees, I accuse the Yankees, I give
responsibility to the Yankees, of any criminal action against me or
against the comrades who are traveling with me,'' he added.
   Ortega said Monday the Contras desisted from their ambush plan
because it was daylight and their retreat would have been more
difficult.
   On Nov. 1, Ortega broke a cease-fire that technically had been
in place since March 1988. He said thousands of Contras had begun
infiltrating from Honduras, where most of them have been based
since the cease-fire was signed.
   The Contras took up arms in 1981, claiming the Sandininstas had
betrayed the goals of the 1979 popular revolution that toppled
dictator Anastasio Somoza. The United States now supplies them only
non-lethal aid.
   Under an agreement between Central American presidents in
August, the Contras were to return to their homeland or be
relocated.
   Thousands of Contras remain in Honduras, and they have refused
to surrender.

   SAN`A, North Yemen (AP) _ North Yemen and South Yemen on Monday
began allowing citizens to move freely between the two countries,
their latest step toward eventual unification.
   At the conclusion of a three-day meeting in San`a, prime
ministers Abdul-Aziz Abdul-Ghani of the capitalist north and Yassin
Saeed No`man of the Communist south declared that citizens could
cross without hindrance.
   They also said all political prisoners would be freed
immediately but gave no numbers.
   The human rights organization Amnesty International has reported
that each nation holds dozens of people as political prisoners.
   The statement from the three-day meeting, which was held to
outline steps to merging the countries, also said the two
governments foresaw a joint body of 33 ministries for the unified
state.
   The two Red Sea countries have been working for unity for more
than a decade despite the difference in ideology between
conservative North Yemen and Marxist South Yemen.
   But the unity drive gained impetus last year as the
Soviet-backed government in South Yemen, following the lead of
other countries, began leaning toward reform.
   President Ali Abdullah Saleh of North Yemen and South Yemeni
Socialist Party Secretary-General Ali Salem al-Beidh have decided
that a joint constitution for the full merger should be prepared by
their parliaments and put to a referendum in both countries no
later than Nov. 30.
   The North Yemeni capital of San`a has been designated as capital
of the united country.
   The border regions are rugged, mountainous and mainly inhabited
by tribes. Yemeni citizens in recent weeks have gained automatic
telephone access to each other's countries, and there are reports
of plans for a joint television program.
   Representatives of the nations today also requested that a
financial and economic committee speed the drafting of single laws
for customs, currency, banking, taxes and other areas.
   Similar instructions were issued to ministries dealing with
education, judiciary, information, legislation, foreign affairs and
diplomatic representation and the interior.
   Asked about adjusting differences in economic systems between a
relatively free North Yemen and a socialist South, No`man said ``we
shall be bound by the economic principles that will emerge in the
constitution and political will.''

   Princess Anne, separated from her husband since
August, on Monday denied reports in British newspapers that she is
to divorce Capt. Mark Phillips.
   ``Divorce? It's not been mentioned,'' Queen Elizabeth II's only
daughter told reporters outside her Gatcombe Park home, British
Broadcasting Corp. television reported.
   Buckingham Palace refused to comment on the Monday reports in
the Daily Express, Daily Mail and Daily Mirror newspapers.
   Anne, 39, and Phillips, 41, separated last August after 15 years
of marriage. They have two children.
   A spokesman at Buckingham Palace, who was not identified in
keeping with British custom, said: ``I have nothing to add to what
was said at the time of the separation.''
   The palace issued a statement on Aug. 31 that said: ``Her Royal
Highness, the Princess Royal, and Captain Mark Phillips have
decided to separate on terms agreed between them. There are no
plans for divorce proceedings.''
   At the time, royal sources said the queen was ``obviously
saddened'' but understood the couple's decision.
   Princess Margaret, Queen Elizabeth II's younger sister, was
divorced from her husband, Lord Snowdon, in 1978.

   The Navy has halted repairs to the
battleship USS Iowa's No. 2 turret amid speculation that the World
War II ship would be mothballed.
   Navy Secretary H.L. Garrett III ordered the work suspended this
weekend after consultations with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   ``This action was agreed upon in view of the uncertainty
surrounding the battleship's future service life,'' a Navy
statement said.
   Fourty-seven sailors were killed when the No. 2 turret exploded
last April.
   The Iowa entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth on
Jan. 13 for a 14-week, $26 million overhaul. Repair to the 16-inch
gun turret was expected to cost about $13 million.
   Pentagon officials have said two of the nation's four
battleships probably would be mothballed to help with cuts in the
defense budget.

   Up to 2 million wailing, black-clad Azerbaijanis
marched through Baku on Monday to mourn those killed when Soviet
troops put down a nationalist revolt, and the republic's
legislature threatened secession if Moscow did not pull out its
soldiers.
   In further defiance of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, local
legislators declared Moscow's state of emergency void. Militants
vowed to keep up crippling strikes in Baku, an oil center of 1.8
million people on the Caspian Sea, until troops leave.
   Communist leaders from Soviet Armenia and Azerbaijan took a
tentative step Monday toward ending 10 days of ethnic warfare,
agreeing to withdraw armed groups from areas along their border,
Tass said. But activists in Armenia and Azerbaijan said they
doubted the truce would be kept.
   The official Soviet news agency reported 12 more people killed
in ethnic clashes Monday on the border of the two republics,
raising the toll since Jan. 13 to 167. Soviet officials said 83 of
those were from the Soviet assault on the Azerbaijani capital
Saturday, including 14 soldiers and members of their families.
   More than 500 have been wounded in the conflicts.
   Tass said the 12 new deaths occurred when Armenian militants
fired on an Azerbaijani village in the Volchy Vorota border area.
   Azerbaijani activists told a Moscow news conference Monday that
3,700 died when Soviet troops entered Baku, Tass said, but it
emphasized this was an unconfirmed figure.
   An emergency overnight session of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet
legislature demanded full withdrawal of Soviet troops from the
republic, with the exception of border districts with Armenia, said
Baku lawyer Viliyad Mamedov, who attended the 11{-hour overnight
session.
   Lawmakers also demanded lifting of the curfew and state of
emergency in Baku and other areas of Azerbaijan, which Moscow
imposed without the approval of Azerbaijani authorities, Mamedov
said in a telephone interview.
   If those demands are not met, Mamedov said, the legislature will
consider voting to secede from the Soviet Union.
   At Monday's mass rally in Baku, demonstrators carried posters
reading, ``Gorbachev is the butcher of the Azerbaijani people,''
and ``Azerbaijanis will not succumb to tanks,'' said Shain Gajiyev,
a Baku journalist.
   Witnesses said throngs of mourners numbering as many as 2
million bore coffins of Azerbaijanis killed in the weekend assault
down the narrow streets and major thoroughfares to Lenin Square,
now renamed Freedom Square in honor of the Azerbaijani nationalist
cause.
   The mourners, wearing black and carrying black-bordered
portraits of some of the victims, then buried the victims at Kirov
Park, overlooking the Caspian Sea.
   ``All the people of Azerbaijan and Baku are in tears and
mourning,'' official Baku Radio said in a broadcast monitored by
the BBC in London.
   Soviet troops and police did not interfere in the funeral, said
Leila Yunusov, a spokeswoman for the Social Democratic Group, an
informal Azerbaijani political organization.
   Foreign reporters were barred from the region, so it was
difficult to determine the exact death toll or reconcile
conflicting information.
   Military officials said no one had been killed in Baku the last
two days, and residents said the Soviet troops seemed to have the
city under control. No armed clashes with troops were reported
Monday, Gajiyev said, although scattered gunfire was heard.
   Conflicting reports came from the Soviet-Iranian border, where
Azerbaijanis have torn down many barriers. The government newspaper
Izvestia said 40,000 Azerbaijanis crossed into Iran on Sunday
evening alone, but Iranian media said Soviet troops clamped down on
the border and were not letting Azerbaijanis out.
   Interfax, an affiliate of Radio Moscow, said unidentified
extremists threatened Russian residents of Baku with violence
unless they left and threatened to blow up oil tankers in Baku's
harbor unless troops were withdrawn.
   Soviet TV on Monday evening suggested the government launch
negotiations with the Azerbaijani People's Front, the nationalist
organization behind much of the unrest. The evening news program
said since the People's Front controls some areas of Azerbaijan, it
is the logical partner for peace talks.
   It was not clear whether the People's Front and Armenian
activists participated in the negotiations in the Armenian town of
Yeraskh.
   High-ranking Armenian and Azerbaijani Communist Party and
government officials also agreed to repair disrupted communications
lines.
   In a statement issued Monday, people's fronts from the Soviet
Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia commiserated with
the Azerbaijanis and said Moscow, with its centralized policies,
was to blame for provoking the conflict. They offered Riga, the
Latvian capital, as a site for peace talks.
   Armenia's popular movements condemned Moscow for the Baku
deaths. When Armenians demanded protection for themselves and
punishment for Azerbaijani extremists who victimized them, they
``did not mean a deployment of the Soviet army in a large-scale,
bloody action, but the use of civilized methods proper to a
law-based state,'' the Armenian Board of National Movements said.
   The statement, read over the phone by activist Rafael Popayan
from Yerevan, the Armenian capital, said ``innocent blood is being
shed, and that cannot leave the Armenian people indifferent.''
   At a protest march by 2,000 Azerbaijanis in Moscow on Monday,
one demonstrator carried a sign reading ``Comrades! In Baku more
than 9,000 people were killed.''
   A gathering Monday in the Azerbaijani town of Pushkino to mourn
those slain ended in mass rioting, Tass said.
   The explosion into violence of the longstanding hostility
between Armenia and Azerbaijan is considered one of the worst
crises Gorbachev has faced in his nearly five-year tenure as Soviet
leader.
   Moscow sent thousands of troops and other forces to Baku after
fighting flared between the Moslem Azerbaijanis and mainly
Christian Armenians this month. The neighboring republics are
locked in a decades-old dispute over the region of
Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inside Azerbaijan but populated mainly
by Armenians.
   The total number of Soviet forces combating the violence in
Armenia and Azerbaijan is reported to be 29,000, including troops,
police, cadets and Interior Ministry forces. The number of
militants is reported in the thousands.
   Violence began Jan. 13 with anti-Armenian rioting in Baku that
killed 67 people by official count and sent thousands of Armenians
fleeing from their homes in panic. It escalated into open warfare
elsewhere in Azerbaijan.
   Sheikh Ul Islam, spiritual leader of Azerbaijani Moslems,
condemned the assault on Baku by Soviet troops in an address to
world and religious leaders sent to Azerinform, Azerbaijan's
official news agency, on Monday.
   The Shiite cleric said evil deeds were committed in Baku over
the weekend, beyond reason. No people are to be talked to with the
language of guns, he said.
   He did not mention the Armenian deaths in Baku the previous week.

<HEAD>Haughey Would Welcome Unionist Talks on Anglo-Irish Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey said
Monday he is willing to talk with Protestants about replacing the
Anglo-Irish accord, a 1985 pact giving the Irish Republic a say in
the affairs of Northern Ireland.
   But Haughey reiterated his government's commitment to the
accord, which is aimed at protecting interests of the 40 percent
Roman Catholic minority in the strife-torn British colony.
   Haughey's carefully worded statement came after weekend
overtures from two leading figures in the Ulster Unionist Party,
the largest party in Northern Ireland that is adamantly against the
1985 agreement.
   ``I would welcome hearing unionist concerns at first hand,''
Haughey said. ``I place no restriction on the agenda.
   ``I would be quite prepared to consider any agreed alternative
arrangements which would replace the existing agreement'' if
Britain also agreed, he added.
   Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Brooke, found the
developments ``encouraging.''
   ``There does seem to be signs of movement,'' he told the British
Broadcasting Corp. TV in an interview in Washington, ``and what
happened over the weekend seems to me to be further evidence of
that fluidity.''
   Most Protestants favor some form of power-sharing with
Catholics, but the more vehement loyalists see the Anglo-Irish
agreement as a prelude to being drawn into a united and
Catholic-dominated Ireland.
   The Protestant parties' anger about the agreement has been an
obstacle to ending sectarian fighting in the province that has left
2,777 people dead.
   In an interview with Dublin's Sunday Press, Jim Nicholson,
deputy chief of the Ulster Unionists, and party chairman Jack Allen
were quoted as saying they were ``prepared to put everything on the
table'' if Haughey publicly indicated he would consider a new
framework to replace the Anglo-Irish Agreement.
   Haughey reiterated Dublin's continuing commitment to the accord
``unless and until it is transcended by a new and more
comprehensive arrangement,'' but said it had never been regarded as
immutable.
   ``The start of a new decade reinforces our sense of urgency
about bringing to an end the violence that the people of Northern
Ireland have endured for the past 20 years,'' Haughey said.
   Haughey, who has previously issued invitations to unionist
leaders to meet him for discussions, has come under growing
domestic political pressure to achieve this during his six-month
presidency of the European Community.
   In Belfast, Peter Robinson, a leading member of the smaller
Democratic Unionist Party, said, ``His remarks express fine
sentiments but very little substance.''
   The Irish Republic, although it has not relinquished its
long-held claim to the north, is in consensus with the British
government that nothing can change in Northern Ireland without
Protestant consent.

<HEAD>Former Armored Car Driver Waives Extradition in $651,000 Heist</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former armored car guard who gambled away
$651,000 stolen from his truck during two years on the lam agreed
Monday to return to Philadelphia for trial.
   Edward Leigh Hunt Jr. told reporters he had spent his two years
as a fugitive living in Hollywood _ ``a block from the Chinese
theater'' _ and consumed much of the time studying Spanish because
``I love languages.''
   ``I'm very glad the whole thing is over,'' he said.
   The 26-year-old Hunt, handcuffed and wearing blue jail
coveralls, waived extradition on interstate theft charges.
   Hunt wouldn't explain details of a gambling system he has said
he devised in an effort to make a profit on the money taken Jan.
20, 1988, from a truck belonging to the Brooks Armored Car Co. in
Philadelphia.
   ``I stole the money because I thought I could quadruple it
through gambling, and then I would give half to the company I stole
it from,'' Hunt said in a Dec. 20 letter to his hometown newspaper,
the Wilmington (Del.) News Journal.
   ``But I lost it all. ... I screwed up. ... I'm sorry,'' the
letter said.
   Hunt said in the letter that he would give himself up in Los
Angeles on the second anniversary of the heist. He kept his promise.
   Asked Monday if all his gambling was in Las Vegas, Hunt shook
his head and declined explanation.
   Hunt made a brief appearance before U.S. Magistrate Ralph
Geffen, who accepted his waiver and ordered him held without bail
until he is transferred to Philadelphia. The FBI and U.S. Marshal's
office said it could take several days to assemble the paperwork
for transfer.
   On Jan. 20, 1988, Hunt was one of three guards working on the
armored truck in Philadelphia. Two other guards returned from a
bank to the truck to find that Hunt and two bags of cash had
disappeared. Millions of dollars in cash, Hunt's gun and a uniform
jacket were left behind.
   An arrest warrant was issued for Hunt two days later and he was
indicted on April 26, 1988, on interstate theft charges by a
Philadelphia grand jury.

<HEAD>Argentina Gets Fourth Central Bank President in Six Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the fourth time in six
months, Argentina has a new Central Bank president.
   Enrique Folcini was appointed to the post Monday following the
resignation of Rodolfo Rossi, who lasted five weeks.
   Analysts said Rossi was forced out by private banks troubled by
the government's decision Jan. 1 to convert several billion dollars
of short-term certificates of deposits to 10-year bonds in a bid to
stabilize the economy.
   That move curtailed currency speculation that was devaluing the
austral daily and reduced sky-high 600-percent-a-month interest
rates by abruptly restricting the money supply.
   However, private banks said their reserves held by the Central
Bank were not enough to cover the new bonds, and wrangled with
Economy Ministry officials to expand use of the bonds, something
Rossi opposed.
   Rossi's resignation, rumored for days, occurred Friday when he
met with Economy Minister Antonio Gonzalez, a Central Bank official
said.
   Gonzalez officially accepted it Monday and named Folcini
successor.
   Rossi also reportedly lost favor with his own Union of the
Democratic Center political party when the Central Bank this month
printed 1 trillion australs _ $500 million _ an amount that almost
doubled the money supply.
   That monetary expansion, which Rossi had pledged to quell,
almost certainly will fuel inflation that was 40 percent in
December and is projected at at least that this month.
   Folcini, 53, is an economist and former university professor. He
was director of the Central Bank from 1976-81 during the military
dictatorship, and previously served in high-level posts in the
economy and treasury ministries.
   ``He's a banker's kind of guy,'' an economic consultant said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``His strength is he knows the
Central Bank and Treasury inside out.''
   Since Carlos Menem of the Peronist party took office last July,
he has sworn in three economy ministers during a time of
hyperinflation, record interest rates and the threat of social
unrest.
   Argentina's foreign debt too remains onerous _ at $62 billion
the third highest in Latin America after Brazil and Mexico.
   Menem, 59, has pledged to address Argentina's chronic economic
stagnation by curtailing the budget deficit that is seen as a prime
cause of inflation, selling state-owned money-losing companies and
attracting foreign investment.
   Felipe de la Balze, a banking consultant, said Rossi was a
victim _ like his predecessors Javier Gonzalez Fraga and Egidio
Iannella _ of the general crisis rather than a specific cause.
   ``It's like the Titanic: when it's about to go down, is it
relevant the hundred things that happened just before it did?'' de
la Balze said.
   ``I think Rossi was swallowed by the crisis,'' he added. ``A
specific cause is not relevant. The financial and economic crisis
is so big it swallows people every 30 to 60 days.''

   Some 29.1 million people now live in
California, about 11.7 percent of the population of the United
States, as the state's growth expands at its greatest rate in more
than 25 years, the state reported Monday.
   As of July 1, 1989, the most recent date for which figures are
available, California had 29,063,000 inhabitants, 2.6 percent more
than the year before and the greatest rate of increase since
1963-64, the state Finance Department said. The current population
is 11.1 million more than New York, the nation's second-most
populous state.
   As of July 1, California's population had swelled by 23 percent
since the beginning of the decade, climbing from 23,668,049.
   The start-of-the-decade figure is the actual count of the 1980
census. All of the later figures are estimates. The next official
census will be this coming April 1.
   The department also said that net migration for 1988-89 was the
highest since 1942-43, when the state lured hundreds of thousands
of people to military bases or to toil in World War II industries.
   Amid the general expansion, one county _ San Francisco _ lost
population to 727,400. The fastest growing county in California was
Riverside, which grew by 7.8 percent to 1.06 million.
   Los Angeles County remained the most populous of the state's 58
counties, at 8.7 million, follwed by San Diego County with 2.45
million and Orange County with 2.3 million.
   During the past decade, California's share of the country's
total population has risen from 10.4 percent in 1980 to the current
11.7 percent.

   Faisal Husseini, a leading Palestinian activist
and potential peace negotiator with Israel, was freed from jail
Monday. The United States had called his detention an obstacle to
Middle East diplomacy.
   In a related matter, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir threatened to
resign if he loses a vote of confidence in his right-wing Likud
bloc. Likud leaders will meet next month on motions by hard-liners
that Shamir's peace plan be dropped.
   Attorney General Yosef Harish ordered an investigation of
allegations that Science Minister Ezer Weizman met illegally with
high officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Shamir made similar accusations three weeks ago and forced
Weizman out of the powerful Inner Cabinet.
   Weizman represents the center-left Labor Party, which is in a
tenuous ``national unity'' coalition with Likud. He cannot be tried
unless Parliament lifts his legislative immunity.
   Husseini was freed after three days of questioning about
suspicions that he belonged to a ``hostile organization'' and gave
other Palestinians $450 to buy military uniforms.
   Husseini, 49, lives in Arab east Jerusalem, which Israeli has
annexed. No charges were filed, but police said the investigation
would continue.
   Several dozen Israeli militants scuffled with Palestinian
supporters of Husseini as he left the jail. They shouted ``Death to
Husseini!'' and ``Death to the terrorists!''
   Riot police with clubs pushed reporters away and dragged off
several Jewish militants.
   At a news conference in east Jerusalem later, Husseini said he
was arrested because Israel did not want him in a Palestinian
delegation expected to hold preliminary peace talks with Israeli
officials in Cairo.
   Shamir has said he does not want Palestinians from east
Jerusalem included because that would undermine Israel's claim to
the city.
   ``Mr. Shamir ... thinks maybe to put Faisal Husseini in jail so
he cannot be part of the delegation,'' Husseini said. ``The
Israelis know I will continue to work for peace. ... I hope we are
near the stage'' of opening peace talks.
   It was Husseini's first public confirmation that he wants to
join the Palestinian delegation.
   The Cairo meeting is supposed to deal with Shamir's plan for
elections among the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip for representatives to negotiate limited
Palestinian autonomy.
   A central question in peace efforts is whether Jerusalem should
be on the agenda. Shamir refuses to negotiate its status.
   Husseini said Palestinians were willing to accept Jerusalem ``as
one city, with two capitals, west Jerusalem for Israelis and east
Jerusalem for the Palestinians.'' He made the remark in Hebrew.
   At a meeting of the Likud Central Committee scheduled for Feb.
7, hard-liners plan to urge Shamir to drop the election idea.
   On army radio, Shamir said: ``It is very clear that, if the
Central Committee doesn't support me, I cannot stand at the head of
Likud and not at the head of the country.''
   Economics Minister Yitzhak Modai, a prominent Likud hard-liner,
dimissed Shamir's resignation threat, saying on radio:
   ``Nobody doubts his position ... as the head of the movement and
as our prime minister. But privileges also entail responsibilities,
and I don't think the Central Committee would be impressed by this
dramatic announcement. We are talking about the essence, and he is
talking about personal status.''
   Etti Eshed, spokeswoman for the Justice Ministry, confirmed an
investigation of Weizman had begun but would not give details.
   Israeli media have said Weizman was suspected of meeting with
PLO official Nabi Ramlawi in Geneva in mid-December and of having
telephone conversations with PLO figures in Tunis.
   Israel forbids contacts with the PLO, which it regards as a
terrorist organization, and violators of the law can be imprisoned
for up to three years.
   In the occupied West Bank, the body of a 35-year-old Palestinian
was found in Talouza village. He apparently was slain on suspicion
of collaborating with Israeli authorities, Arab reports said.
   Farhan Salah's death raised to 172 the number of people killed
by other Palestinians during the 25-month-old uprising, most on
suspicion of collaborating.
   Israeli soldiers or civilians have killed 648 Palestinians and
43 Israelis have died.
   Soldiers in the Gaza Strip shot and wounded seven youths aged 12
to 17 on Monday, Arab hospital officials reported.
   Reports in the West Bank said a 3-year-old boy from Turah was
hit in the head by a plastic bullet and was in serious condition in
Ramallah Hospital.

<TEXT>
   The Navy's search for a quieter nuclear
submarine is causing a ruckus in this port town.
   Residents are divided over Pentagon plans to measure the noise
of Seawolf-class attack submarines in the rich fishing grounds that
support the town's economy.
   On one side are those who support the project as a contribution
to national defense. On the other are those who say it would
threaten the region's lucrative sport fishing industry and make
Ketchikan a potential target for nuclear attack. The opponents also
complain that the Navy has no plan to deal with a nuclear accident
in the isolated area.
   ``It's going to seriously hurt our economy as far as tourism,
sport and commercial fishing industry goes,'' said resident Jack
Lee, one of the project's most outspoken critics.
   Lee added that the community ``also has some very valid concerns
about safety, about our inability to evacuate in light of the
Navy's pathetic safety record.''
   Supporters say those are the unfounded fears of a small but
vocal minority in a town that has long welcomed visiting Navy
vessels with its fishing fleet and tourist-filled cruise ships.
   ``The activists are the kind you normally see on these anti-nuke
things _ these bearded, long-haired artists,'' said Ralph
Bartholomew, a member of the Ketchikan Gateway Borough Assembly.
``They're the kind that aren't producing much in the community.
They're living off it.''
   Concerns over the project have been raised far beyond the
mountainous, spruce-carpeted islands of southeastern Alaska. A
lawsuit to halt the project is pending in federal court in
Washington, D.C., and objections have been heard in the Canadian
Parliament.
   Although the state has not officially approved the project, the
Navy began clearing a site for a $12.7 million facility on tiny
Back Island last fall.
   Beginning next year, the Navy plans to use a stretch of Behm
Canal near Back Island for tests aimed at making U.S. submarines
the quietest in the world. The site, about 25 miles north of
Ketchikan and 688 miles north of Seattle, is within one of the most
popular sport fishing grounds in Alaska.
   King salmon up to 40 pounds and halibut over 100 pounds are
frequently caught in the sheltered waters of Behm Canal. Charter
and resort operators fear the movement of submarines will scare
away the fish and the fishermen.
   Gene Romano, a Navy spokesman in Seattle, said the sub tests
would be conducted periodically. In one, submarines would move
between underwater microphones; in another, a barge-mounted crane
would suspend a submarine under water with its engines off while
on-board equipment is turned on and off to test its contribution to
the vessel's noise level.
   ``The acoustical testing of submarines is a critical factor in
maintaining superiority in the submarine force,'' Romano said.
   The Navy argues that the task can best be done in the quiet,
island-protected waters of Behm Canal. A sound-testing range in
Puget Sound near Tacoma, Wash., has become too noisy to be
effective, officials say.
   Development of the Alaska site coincides with construction of
the first Seawolf submarine by General Dynamics Corp. in Groton,
Conn. Its estimated cost is $1.7 billion.
   Romano would not say if Back Island was designed specifically
with the Seawolf in mind. ``The site will be designed to test all
types of Navy submarines,'' he said.
   A lawsuit opposing the testing was filed by the Foundation on
Economic Trends, a Washington, D.C.-based technology and military
watchdog group. Ketchikan groups representing environmentalists,
sport fishermen, natives and a wilderness resort joined the lawsuit.
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green declined to issue a
preliminary injunction two months ago, but said it appeared the
Navy had violated the National Environmental Policy Act in planning
the project. Her ruling on a request for a permanent injunction is
expected soon.
   Romano said the Navy has modified its plans to meet community
concerns. In response to fishing interests, the Navy has changed
its proposed testing times and created a corridor in which fishing
boats can move at slow speed and not have to wait for the tests.
   ``Obviously in today's age it's almost impossible to have a
major construction project that's not going to upset someone,'' he
said. ``But we feel the majority of the people are in support of
the project.''

<HEAD>Bill Presented Calling for Extension on Removal Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government presented a bill to
Parliament Monday calling for a six-month extension on the May
deadline for the United States to dismantle its military
installations in Greece.
   Under terms of a defense accord that expired in December 1988,
the United States has until May 21 to remove personnel and property
from four major bases and several smaller installations unless a
new agreement is reached.
   The bill would extend to Nov. 21 the deadline for dismantling
the bases, which were established in the mid-1950s.
   The bill, signed by Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras and Defense
Minister Tzannis Tzannetakis, is to be debated by a parliamentary
committee on Tuesday. It will then be presented to a full
parliamentary session for debate and a vote.
   The conservative and socialist parties that support Premier
Xenophon Zolotas' three-party administration decided last month to
grant the six-month extension requested by the United States so
that negotiations on a new defense pact could continue.
   The two parties hold 276 seats in the 300-member Parliament. The
Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress is opposed to the
bases remaining in Greece but has said it will not withdraw from
the government in the event of a law postponing their removal.
   General elections in November were inconclusive, and the Zolotas
administration was appointed to deal with pressing economic and
foreign policy issues.
   New elections are slated for April, leaving the next government
to work toward an agreement with the United States.
   The previous five-year Defense and Economic Cooperation Accord
negotiated by the former Socialist government and Washington
expired in December 1988. It gave the United States 17 months to
dismantle the bases if no new accord was reached.
   After 17 rounds of fruitless negotiations, Athens and Washington
suspended talks before national elections last June. A short-lived
coalition formed by the conservative and Communist parties after
those elections put the issue on hold.
   The Socialist government headed by former Premier Andreas
Papandreou had demanded that any new defense accord include
guarantees of help in case of aggression by NATO ally Turkey, which
the United States has been wary of providing.
   Greece and Turkey almost went to war in March 1987 over disputed
territorial waters in the Aegean Sea.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. will recall 244,000
four-cylinder Pontiac Fieros _ every one ever made _ because of a
nagging engine-fire problem that contributed to the company's
decision to scuttle the two-seater.
   The Fiero was an immediate sales success in September 1983, but
its demise at the end of the 1988 model year came nearly as
quickly, partly after consumer advocate Ralph Nader alleged engine
problems led to fires.
   General Motors hasn't determined when the recall will take
effect or what kind of repair work will be performed, company
spokesman Tom Pyden said Monday.
   ``We've notified NHTSA (the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration) of our intent to conduct a recall,'' Pyden said.
   He said GM was working on the procedure for a recall ``and until
that point it is premature to come out and notify owners and
dealers.''
   Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the national highway safety agency,
said Monday the agency received a letter dated Dec. 28, 1989, from
GM saying the company would recall the cars. Hurd would not say if
it was unusual that a month pass between the time the agency was
notified and the time a recall is issued.
   It is the second time the four-cylinder Fiero has been recalled
because of possible engine fires. Pontiac made about 100,000
six-cylinder Fieros, which will not be subject to the recall.
   ``It is my understanding that the previous fix has not solved
the problem of fires in Fieros,'' Hurd said from his Washington
office. ``I'm sure that GM is working as hard as it can in good
faith to get this problem solved.''
   In 1987, GM recalled 125,000 four-cylinder versions produced in
the 1984 model year after engine fires occurred in one of every 400
cars. The company said engine connecting rods, which link pistons
to the crankshaft, could blast through the side of the engine,
causing an oil leak which could cause a fire. During that recall,
GM made some alterations, including boosting oil capacity to four
quarts from three and urging motorists to check the engine oil
every time they got gasoline.
   Word of the recall was published Friday in the national highway
safety agency's monthly defect report. GM was caught unaware that
the notice would be published, said spokesman Reggie Harris.
   ``This is unusual. Normally, we would make our own announcement
when we have a program in place,'' Harris said.
   GM began making the Fiero at a plant in Pontiac in January 1983
for the 1984 model year. The first car was rolled off the assembly
line in July 1983, with a base price of $7,999.
   On March 1, 1988, Pontiac announced that Fiero production would
end with the 1988 model year, when 24,621 Fieros were sold.

   Roman Vishniac, a photographer who spent much of
the 1930s photographing pre-Holocaust Jewish life in Eastern
Europe, died on Monday at his home here. He was 92.
   ``He used to say he took (Adolph) Hitler (threats) seriously and
therefore he took the pictures,'' said a relative, Jesse Cherry.
``Everything he photographed was subsequently destroyed.''
   Born in Pavlovsk, Russia, on Aug. 18, 1897, Vishniac came to the
United States in 1940.
   He was a medical science photographer in Berlin from 1920 to
1939 and had documented Jewish life in Germany with photographs
from 1935 to 1939.
   His works are included in the permanent collections of the
Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Smithsonian Institute and the
Library of Congress in Washington and the Jewish Museum in New York.
   His works are published in several books, including ``A Vanished
World,'' which he wrote in 1983.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<TEXT>
   An anonymous donor on Monday offered two $25,000
rewards for information leading to the arrest and indictment of
those responsible for a series of attacks on children in two Dallas
neighborhoods, police said.
   Deputy Police Chief Lowell Cannaday said at a news conference
that the reward was posted anonymously Monday morning.
   In Oak Cliff last week, two children were abducted as they
walked to school and driven elsewhere, where they were raped. In
each case, the assailant drove them back and let them off in the
vicinity where they had been picked up.
   In far north Dallas, someone broke into homes late at night and
abducted four young girls. In three of the cases, the victims were
sexually assaulted.
   Police believe the north Dallas and Oak Cliff attacks are
unrelated.
   Cannaday said the Oak Cliff assailant apparently has been
driving a white pickup. He said the girls have given investigators
a partial license plate of ``776.''
   Cannaday said the victims in the north Dallas attacks were all
white, ages 7 to 10, and the victims in the Oak Cliff attacks in
far south Dallas were all black, ages 10 to 15. The most recent
attack occurred Jan. 19.
   Police said the north Dallas attacker has broken into homes
since September through fences and security systems to take the
girls from their bedrooms. He usually assaults them outside the
home and leaves. The most recent incident was Jan. 10, when the
girl screamed and escaped when the assailant dropped her.

<HEAD>Fruit Exports to U.S. Resume after Mediterranean Fly Scare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fruit exports to the United States from
the central Aconcagua Valley resumed Monday, five days after the
discovery of Mediterranean fruit flies in the area prompted a
regional quarantine.
   Authorities said the problem is now considered under control,
and no new findings of flies were reported after fruit was
fumigated and trees were sprayed with pesticide in the valley 50
miles northeast of the capital Santiago.
   Monday's shipment from the Aconcagua Valley was the first since
authorities reported Wednesday that at least 12 Mediterranean fruit
flies _ the first since 1978 _ were found in a residential
neighborhood of Los Andes.
   Ronald Bown, president of the Fruit Exporters Association, said
47,000 crates of grapes and other fruit from the valley were loaded
Monday in the neighboring port of Valparaiso for shipment to the
United States.
   The Aconcagua area fruit was fumigated and stored in cold
chambers in the boat, separated from 300,000 crates of fruit from
other regions in the country. The low-temperature storage for
periods of three to four days is a common procedure to fight the
fly and its larvae, which are harmless to humans.
   Experts from the United States Department of Agriculture
supervised the shipment, Bown said.
   Jorge Prado, president of the National Agriculture Society, an
organization of Chile's largest private farmers, said the main
problem in the Aconcagua Valley now is the lack of enough
fumigation capacity and cold storage facilities.
   Grapes, peaches, nectarines and kiwis are grown in the Aconcagua
area. About 16 million crates are expected to be harvested this
year in the valley, virtually all for export to the United States,
Japan and western Europe.
   Last year, Chile's fruit exporters suffered a major blow when
two grapes laced with cyanide were found in a Chilean shipment in
Philadelphia.
   The finding prompted the U.S Food and Drug Administration to
temporarily ban the sale of Chilean fruit in the United States.
Resulting losses were estimated at $300 million.
   Fruit exports have boomed in recent years, earning about $900
million annually for Chile, which as Latin America's fourth largest
foreign debt.

<TEXT>
   A member of a white gang charged in the fatal
shooting of a black teen-ager said in a videotaped statement to
police that the victim and his friends were attacked without
provocation.
   ``They were young and they were small and did not say one word
to us,'' Charles Stressler said in the tape made the day after the
shooting last August in the Brooklyn neighborhood fo Bensonhurst.
   The videotape was presented Monday during a pretrial hearing
before Judge Thaddeus Owens of Brooklyn state Supreme Court. The
hearing was continued until Tuesday with no decision on whether the
tape will be used as evidence.
   Owens scheduled a trial in the case for March 5 and ordered one
of the seven defendants, Keith Mondello, 20, to be tried separately.
   Prosecutors want the videotape and other police statements of
the defendants submitted as evidence, but defense attorneys contend
investigators failed to notify the youths they had the right to
remain silent.
   Yusuf Hawkins, 16, was shot to death Aug. 23, 1989, when he and
three friends were surrounded by a gang of about 30 white youths in
mostly white Bensonhurst. The black teen-agers had gone to the
neighborhood to look at a used car.
   On the night of the shooting, white youths in the neighborhood
said they believed a gang of blacks were coming to their turf
looking for a fight.
   Stressler said 20 or 30 youths, many armed with baseball bats
and other weapons, gathered on the street.
   Stressler, 21, said in the videotape made several hours before
he was arrested that the white gang saw Hawkins and his friends
walking down the street.
   ``Someone turned the corner and said: Are these the kids? Are
these the kids?'' Stressler said.
   Hawkins and his companions ``didn't say anything. They didn't
get in our way,'' he said. ``You just knew they weren't looking for
trouble. ... They were minding their own business.''
   Stressler, Mondello and four other young whites were charged
with second-degree murder. A seventh defendant, Steven Curreri, 19,
was charged with first-degree assault.
   All of the defendants except the alleged triggerman have been
released on bail.

   Rock musician Frank Zappa on
Monday met a fellow maverick, new Czechoslovak President Vaclav
Havel.
   Zappa, who has a cult-following in Czechoslovakia, arrived in
Prague Sunday, and was welcomed by hundreds of fans at Ruzyne
airport.
   ``Never in my 25 years in rock'n'roll have experienced anything
like this, and I don't have the slightest idea of why this is
happening,'' Zappa told journalists on arrival.
   Asked by Czechoslovak television what he thought of Communism
after the dramatic democratic changes that have occurred in much of
Eastern Europe, Zappa replied with acid brevity _ ``The same.''
   Zappa met Monday with Havel, a banned playwright of
international renown who became president last month, outlining his
ideas of cultural and economic cooperation between the two
countries, the official news agency CTK said.
   ``Havel told Zappa he would support holding a giant rock concert
of Western and Czechoslovak musicians this summer in Prague,''
sources present at the meeting said.
   Zappa, known for his cynical comments about American political
life on records such as ``Freak Out'' and ``Joe's Garage,'' visited
Czechoslovakia at the invitation of Michael Kocab, a Czechoslovak
rock musician and member of parliament.

<TEXT>
   A tanker that ran aground and spilled
57,600 gallons of gasoline in Alaska's Inside Passage over the
weekend struck a submerged boulder and leaked fuel in the same
channel in 1988, officials said Monday.
   The tanker Frank H. Brown resumed its trip north to Skagway with
a Coast Guard escort and a relief captain Monday, less than two
days after it struck a charted reef in Wrangell Narrows, 15 miles
south of Petersburg.
   The tanker hit a boulder in the channel on Jan. 26, 1988, and
the Coast Guard fined the ship's Canadian owner $500 for leaking
4,094 gallons of gasoline, said Petty Officer Bud Stevenson at the
Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office in Juneau.
   The slow leak was not discovered until the tanker docked at
Skagway and the tanks were unloaded, said Marvin Taylor, president
of White Pass Transportation Inc. in Whitehorse, Yukon. The boulder
left a 2-3 inch crack in the tanker's hull, he said.
   The boulder since has been removed by the Army Corps of
Engineers, Coast Guard spokesman Greg Robinson said.
   Saturday's spill remained under investigation by the Coast Guard
and White Pass. Blood and urine samples taken from the crew were
being tested for alcohol and drugs Monday in Petersburg, Robinson
said. Such tests are conducted routinely after ship accidents.
   The 400-foot ship ran into Burnt Island Reef on Saturday night.
The reef is marked by a lighted buoy, Coast Guard spokesman Ed
Moreth said.
   The ship's captain, John Kininmont of Vancouver, British
Columbia, told the Coast Guard that the grounding resulted from ``a
judgment error,'' Coast Guard spokesman Ed Moreth said.
   Taylor said he no indication of what went wrong and had not
talked to Kininmont.
   ``Mr. Kininmont has been employed with us about 25 years and
he's got an unblemished record. He's a very fine employee,'' Taylor
said.
   The channel where the grounding occurred is one of the more
difficult in the Inside Passage, he said.
   The Coast Guard said it decided not to clean up the gasoline
because it dissipated and evaporated quickly. State officials said
the spill caused minimal damage to the marine environment. No dead
fish or birds were found.
   ``It appeared the strong tidal action and the fact that the tide
was running out into more open waters did the most to protect the
resources,'' said William Bergmann, area management biologist in
Petersburg for the state Department of Fish and Game.
   After the ship unloads its 1.8 million gallon cargo of diesel
fuel, gasoline and heating oil in Skagway, it will return to its
home port of Vancouver for repair of a 2-foot hole in its hull,
Taylor said.

   The Justice Department has decided not to try
to prosecute Felix Bloch, the American diplomat suspected of spying
for the Soviet Union, ABC News said Monday night.
   The department declined to confirm the report.
   Bloch was the subject of a massive and highly visible FBI
surveillance last year after it was learned that he had been
videotaped passing a suitcase to a Soviet agent in Paris.
   Bloch had been the No. 2 official of the U.S. Embassy in Vienna
for much of the Reagan administration before taking up an
assignment in Washington.
   Though he was placed on administrative leave in June, he
continued to draw his $80,000 annual salary.
   The visible agents were withdrawn in December and there were
reports at the time that the Department had all but given up hope
of prosecuting Bloch on an espionage charge.
   What has not been reported is what if any secrets Bloch is
supposed to have given to the Soviet union _ the necessary
ingredient for an espionage prosecution.
   Bloch is said to have been wiretapped telling his wife that he
accepted payments from the Soviets. But such a wiretap might not be
admissible in an American court, analysts have noted.
   David Runkel, spokesman for the Justice Department, said Monday
night he understood that the investigation of Bloch was still
continuing. He also said, ``It is my understanding'' that no
decision had been made one way or another on whether to prosecute
Bloch.
   Bloch was quoted as telling the network he does not know what
the government is doing with his case. ``The situation hasn't
changed,'' he said. His lawyer, John Bray, declined to comment.
   Though the State Department has not acted against Bloch, he will
have to leave in April if he has not won promotion by then. As a
30-year veteran, he would be entitled to a pension.

   Fourteen military officers under
ousted dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega have been charged with
crimes and a top civilian supporter is under arrest for
investigation of homicide, officials said Monday.
   Attorneys for the detained men tried to file writs to obtain
their release. Relatives of the detainees, waiting ouside the
Modelo Prison to visit, complained that the new government was
acting like the Noriega regime that was ousted by the Dec. 20 U.S.
invasion.
   ``It is an outrage,'' said Juan Materno Vazquez, a lawyer who is
defending some of the prisoners. ``Their human and civil rights
have been violated by the government, which first detains them and
then invites charges and complaints against them.''
   ``They will have all the rights guaranteed by law,'' a
spokeswoman at the attorney general's office said.
   Former ruling party legislator and close Noriega associate
Rigoberto Paredes led the list of 29 prisoners brought from the
U.S. Army base at Fort Clayton to Panama's Modelo jail late Sunday.
   The Attorney General's office said Paredes, a former legislator
for Noriega's Democratic Revolutionary Party, was under arrest and
authorities were studying possible charges of homicide, abuse of
authority, personal injury and theft.
   A source at the attorney general's office said the charges were
based on complaints filed by Panamanian citizens and authorities.
   The highest of the military officers was Col. Alberto Purcell,
third in command of Noriega's Defense Forces. He was charged with
crimes against the state, the attorney's office said.
   Three lieutenant colonels, five majors and four captains were
held on charges that included abuse of authority, crimes against
the state and public administration, theft, damage to public
property and torture, officials said.
   All had turned themselves in or been arrested by U.S. troops
following the Dec. 20 invasion to overthrow Noriega. They had been
held at Fort Clayton at the request of the Panamanian government
pending investigation.
   Some other high-ranking officers are among 55 prisoners still
held by the Americans.
   The second in command of the Defense Forces, Col. Marcos
Justine, and officers like Capt. Luis Quiel who, according to
reliable sources, ``was the (U.S.) Drug Enforcement
Administration's man in Noriega's Defense Forces,'' were among
those at Clayton.
   Several other top officers have sought asylum in foreign
embassies. They include Gonzalo Gonzalez, commander of Noriega's
headquarters security company; Eliezer Gaytan, a captain in charge
of Noriega's personal security; and Noriega's public relations
director.
   Still at large was Lt. Col. Luis (Papo) Cordova, who critics say
tortured Noriega's foes.
   Other charges filed by private citizens were under investigation
by the Attorney General's office, a spokeswoman said.
   One complaint was filed by Roberto Brenes, former leader of the
Civic Crusade, a group that opposed Noriega. Brenes, who was forced
to go into exile under Noriega, filed a suit against the former
strongman ``for any crimes they may have committed.''
   Several hundred more American troops returned home during the
weekend, bringing the total number in Panama down to 17,500,
including the nearly 12,000 stationed permanently at U.S. bases to
guard the Panama Canal.
   Some military activity was still going on.
   On Monday U.S. soldiers and members of Panama's new public
security force swept through a neighborhood in Colon, on the
Atlantic end of the canal, using helicopters and land vehicles to
search for weapons and suspects.
   A spokesman for the Panamanian Public Force said the operation
was carried out at the request of residents and businessmen who
complained of ``criminals loose in the area.''
   The spokesman said ``guns and drugs'' had been confiscated
during the operation.
   President Guillermo Endara, visiting Costa Rica on his first
foreign trip since he took office at the start of the U.S.
invasion, thanked the neighboring country for its support.
   ``We will always be grateful to Costa Rica because through its
great friendship and support it helped us to put Panama on the road
to democracy and freedom,'' he said in San Jose.
   President Oscar Arias and his entire Cabinet met Endara at the
airport. After their talks, Endara said he had accepted Arias'
suggestion to abolish Panama's army.

   Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion
Barry on Monday checked into a rehabilitation center affiliated
with a Minnesota facility that has worked with substance abusers
for more than 40 years.
   The 60-bed Hanley-Hazelden Treatment Center was opened in 1986
as a satellite unit of the Hazelden Foundation in Center City,
Minn., whose techniques were the model for the Betty Ford clinic in
Rancho Mirage, Calif.
   Foundation spokeswoman Mary Ellen Connolly said federal laws and
internal policies prohibit disclosing the names of present or
former patients. But Barry's spokeswoman, Lurma Rackley, said the
mayor had checked into a center in West Palm Beach on Monday to be
treated for alcoholism.
   Among those who have admitted to spending time at the Minnesota
facility are Kitty Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis; former Washington Redskins player Dexter Manley; and
designer Calvin Klein.
   The Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League worked
with the Hazelden Foundation to develop a drug abuse prevention
program.
   Ms. Connolly said the average stay at the West Palm Beach
facility is 30 days, at an average cost of $7,500. The
Hanley-Hazelden center, in six buildings on the St. Mary's Hospital
grounds, treats about 42 people each month.
   Hazelden's treatment method, known as the Minnesota model,
emphasizes restoring the patient's self-respect, said Hazelden
officials.
   The 197-bed Hazelden Foundation, located about 50 miles north of
Minneapolis, was founded in 1949 by a group of Alcoholics Anonymous
members and businessmen concerned about alcoholism among employees
and relatives.
   It has treated more than 70,000 people, said Daniel Anderson,
Hazelden's president emeritus.
   All patients must attend three daily lectures on drug and
alcohol abuse as well as group sessions and meetings with a
counselor who is a recovering alcoholic.
   They also have reading and writing assignments and chores,
including cleaning their personal quarters, which resemble motel
rooms. The facilities include exercise equipment and well-kept
grounds.
   The foundation also operates an out-patient center in Texas; an
adolescent facility in Plymouth, Minn., and a half-way house in St.
Paul, Minn.

   Panamanian President Guillermo
Endara, making his first foreign trip since taking office during
the U.S. invasion, said Monday that he will abolish Panama's army.
   ``In the working session we had in the Presidential House this
morning, President (Oscar) Arias suggested that Panama should take
advantage of the situation to abolish the army. I accepted that
suggestion and will carry it out,'' Endara said at a news
conference.
   Costa Rica, which abolished its army after a 40-day revolution
in 1948, is the only Latin American country without a national army.
   Instead of spending money on military manpower and equipment,
Costa Rica has devoted its resources to education and health care.
The nation has the highest standard of living in Central America
and has no armed conflicts with its neighbors or opposition groups.
   Endara was formally welcomed Monday by Arias and the Cabinet.
Other Latin American nations have been less willing to recognize
Endara as head of state because he was sworn in at the start of the
Dec. 20 invasion to oust Manuel Antonio Noriega and spent several
days in safety on a U.S. base.
   Endara was leading Noriega's handpicked candidate by a 3-1
margin and expected to win election when Noriega abruptly canceled
the results of last year's presidential balloting.
   When asked how long the U.S. troops would remain in Panama,
Endara said that within a few weeks all 14,500 troops that were
sent in during the invasion would depart, leaving only the usual
contingent of about 12,000 soldiers at U.S. bases in Panama.
   Endara also met with Security Minister Hernan Garron and
Interior Minister Antonio Alvarez to discuss how Costa Rica's
police and rural guard operate.
   ``We want to learn the Costa Rican model. With the material and
explanation they gave us, we will try to implement it because this
model is what the Panamanian people want,'' Endara told reporters.
   After the meeting, Arias told reporters he suggested that Endara
take advantage of the new situation in Panama to abolish the army.
Arias, who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts to end
Central American conflicts, made this suggestion in a recent New
York Times op-ed piece.
   Endara is scheduled to return to Panama on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Governor Proposes Automobile Insurance Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MARTELLO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Jim Florio proposed massive reform of
New Jersey automobile insurance rates Monday, vowing to make good
on a campaign promise to reduce rates that are among the nation's
highest.
   ``Our car insurance system is a disgrace,'' he told state
lawmakers. ``It costs drivers too much. It's too generous to
insurance companies. It's unfair.''
   New Jersey motorists pay an average insurance premium of $1,000
per car. Florio, a Democrat who took office last week, said his
plan would save New Jersey's 4 million motorists an average $225 in
1991.
   The governor's plan includes disbanding a debt-ridden state
underwriting pool for high risk drivers. The insurance industry
would pay off $1.4 billion of the pool's $3 billion debt over seven
years and it would be replaced with a more limited pool for bad
drivers.
   The Joint Underwriting Pool is funded by an annual surcharge of
$225 per car. The fee would be eliminated from New Jersey insurance
policies renewed after March 31, 1991, under Florio's plan.
   A variety of state fees, including those on automobile
registration, would be increased to pay off $1.6 billion of the
pool's debt.
   Florio also wants to raise $7 million a year through a $100
increase in state fees paid by lawyers, doctors, body shops and
others involved in auto insurance claims.
   Robert Gaines, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based
American Insurance Association, said it would be illegal to require
the industry to help pay off the pool's deficit without passing the
cost on to drivers.
   Florio said after his speech to a joint session of the
Legislature that the state would be on firm legal ground if the
idea were enacted and challenged in court.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Police raided three independent
radio stations Monday in the northern port of Cap-Haitien, halting
broadcasts of news about the military government's crackdown on
dissent, a witness reported.
   The witness, an employee of Radio Citadelle, said armed
plainclothes officers burst into the station soon after a 1 p.m.
EST newscast about weekend arrests, beatings and the exile of
political activists.
   Members of the news staff fled before the raid and no one was
arrested, the employee said, on condition of anonymity.
   He reported raids during newscasts at Radio Voix du Nord (Voice
of the North) and Radio Cap-Haitien. All three stations are
privately owned.
   Of the six main radio stations in Port-au-Prince, only the Roman
Catholic Radio Soleil, the Protestant Radio Lumiere and the
government-run National Radio broadcast news on Monday.
   Radio is the main source of news in impoverished Haiti, which
shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with the Dominican
republic.
   Dictators have ruled Haiti much of this century. Most notable
were Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, who gained power in 1957, and
his son, Jean-Claude, who succeeded when his father died in 1971
and ruled until a popular uprising drove him out in 1986.
   Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril came to power by ousting Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy, who took over when Duvalier fled and oversaw elections in
November 1987 that were canceled after thugs in collusion with
soldiers killed at least 34 voters in the first few hours.
   Less than two months later, Namphy's army ran elections that
many voters boycotted and most foreign observers denounced as
fraudulent. He resumed control of the government several months
later.
   In its toughest crackdown on the opposition since taking power
in a September 1988, Avril's government arrested seven prominent
politicians Saturday and Sunday and forced them into exile. Dozens
more were arrested, but were thought to have been released.
   Avril declared a 30-day state of siege and began the crackdown
Saturday, a day after gunmen who have not been identified killed an
army colonel, Andre Neptune, his wife and a housemaid.
   Speaking Monday on Radio Soleil, Bishop Willy Romelus denounced
the government actions and said Avril had ``made rubbish of the
constitution.''
   Radio Soleil said Frank Senat, co-leader of the radical
Jean-Jacques Dessalines Group, was arrested Monday on unspecified
charges. The other co-leader, Sylvain Jolibois, was among those
forced into exile.
   On Saturday night, the government said the state of siege was
necessary to prevent ``terrorism.''
   Critics accused Avril of moving toward dictatorship despite a
pledge to relinquish power to a civilian government after elections
planned for October.
   The opposition Alliance for Democracy and Progress denounced
what it called government ``acts that violate fundanmental human
rights.''
   ``The state of siege makes impossible the normal existence of
political parties and the development of the democratic process,''
it said in a statement.
   In Washington Monday, Pierre Francois Benoit resigned as Haiti's
ambassador to the United States to protest ``repeated violations of
human rights.'' Benoit supports free elections.
   The Bush administration said it ``deplores the actions taken by
the government of Haiti.''
   ``While we regret the recent incidences of violence in Haiti, we
believe the actions taken by the government of Haiti are not an
appropriate response,'' State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler declared.
   Under the state of siege, Avril suspended a law forbidding
forced exile and renewed an entry visa requirement for Haitians
returning from abroad. No guidelines for journalists were issued.
   Port-au-Prince, a city of more than 1 million, was calm Monday.
Shops and schools opened as usual and traffic was normal, but
several people spoke of threats and intimidation.
   Mary-Michelle de Ronceray said her house was under 24-hour
surveillance by soldiers. Her husband, Hubert, is a prominent
conservative politician and among those exiled.
   ``I don't know what my status is,'' she said by telephone. ``I
am not leaving my house.''

   Gunmen late Monday killed a
middle-ranking police officer in his kitchen at his home in Armagh,
a city 35 miles southwest of Belfast, police said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for killing the
officer, who had the police rank of inspector, but suspicion fell
on the Irish Republican Army that has been fighting British rule in
Northern Ireland.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to unite predominantly
Protestant Northern Ireland with the 95 percent Catholic Republic
of Ireland under socialist rule.
   Police headquarters in Belfast said in a statement that the
gunmen fired at least five shots from the backyard of the house
through a glass door, killing the officer in the kitchen.
   The officer, who was in his mid-30s, was hit in the head and
died instantly, police said.
   They said the dead man's wife and his three children were
elsewhere in the house at the time.
   His death brings the overall toll since sectarian and political
violence flared in the province in 1969 to at least 2,781.

   Indian troops and Tamil Tiger
guerrillas clashed in a village in the northern Jaffna Peninsula,
killing more than 30 people, according to reports reaching the
capital Monday.
   Travelers from the region, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said at least 20 civilians were killed at Ariyala on Sunday when
they were caught in the crossfire and in gunfire from Indian
helicopters.
   An Indian diplomat said eight Indian soldiers were killed and 10
were wounded in Sunday's firefight. He claimed there were heavy
casualties among the guerrillas but gave no numbers.
   A Tiger spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said five
guerrillas were killed.
   Each side accused the other of initiating the fighting, and both
said the clash at Ariyala, 175 miles northeast of Colombo and two
miles south of Jaffna town, was a serious violation of the
cease-fire agreed to last September.
   Indian troops, who entered Sri Lanka in 1987 to help end a Tamil
revolt against the Sinhalese-controlled government, have been
withdrawing and are scheduled to pull out the last of their men by
March 31.
   A fierce power struggle has ensued between the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eeelam and other Tamil armed groups.
   The Tigers, the largest guerrilla group, have routed pro-Indian
Tamil guerrillas from several areas vacated by the Indians.
   The Tamil insurrection started in 1983, with Tamil militants
saying they needed a separate homeland to preserve their language
and culture and thwart what they said was discrimination by the
Sinhalese majority in jobs and education.
   More than 11,000 people have been killed since then in
northeastern Sri Lanka where most Tamils live. In addition, 6,000
people have been killed in the Sinhalese heartland in central and
southern Sri Lanka as ultranationalist Sinhalese guerrillas battle
the Sinhalese-dominated government.
   Sinhalese extremists claimed the government was making too many
concessions to Tamils by promising them more autonomy in the
northeast.
   Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, make up 75 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people, while Tamils, who are predominantly
Hindu, account for 18 percent.

   Singer-songwriter Neil Diamond was honored
Monday during the American Music Awards presentations with a

   Stevie Wonder, the 1982 Award of Merit winner, presented the

   ``Beginning in the 1960s, he has written, recorded and performed
his very special songs about love, loneliness, good times and
patriotic feelings about America,'' read the inscription on the
trophy.
   ``This is very, very special. ... I just want to say that these

honor.
   Wonder presented the award after a videotape retrospective of
Diamond's career. Wonder said Diamond's music has delighted
millions and called him ``one of the greatest performing

   Israel officially reopened its
embassy in Ethiopia's capital Monday, 16 years after the two
nations severed relations.
   Diplomatic ties were restored last November and the embassy has
been functioning since then with a small staff under a charge
d'affaires, Meir Joffe.
   Joffe, who lowered the Israeli flag at the embassy when
relations were cut, hoisted it once again over the modest
chancellery on the northeastern outskirts of the city.
   Attending the rededication ceremony was Itzhak Shelef, assistant
director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. He, like Joffe,
formerly served in Ethiopia.
   Also attending were a half-dozen elderly Ethiopian Jews, known
as Falashas. About 8,000 Falashas arrived in Israel in 1984 and
1985 in a clandestine airlift called ``Operation Moses.''
   An estimated 15,000 Falashas remain in Ethiopia and Joffe said
he hoped the government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam ``will
allow the union of families.''
   Acting under pressure from Arab states, Ethiopia halted the
joint U.S.-Israeli airlift shortly after its existence was leaked
to the press. It had been in operation about three months.
   Ethiopia cut diplomatic ties with Israel in response to a call
by the Organization of African Unity for collective action against
the Jewish state after its October 1973 Yom Kippur war with Egypt.
   Most other African nations also ended diplomatic relations with
Israel, but ties have recently been restored with Kenya, Zaire,
Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Togo, Central African Republic,
Egypt and Ghana.

<TEXT>
   A judge on Monday rejected allegations
that investigators broke the law when they staged a second raid on
a Palestinian's apartment to hunt for evidence in the bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103.
   Scottish police want to compare clothing seized in the raids
with shreds found in a suitcase believed to have contained the bomb
which downed Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, 1988,
killing 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
   Swedish police, working with Scottish investigators, confiscated
the clothes in a Jan. 12 raid on the apartment of Mohammed Abu
Talb, who was sentenced last month to life in prison on separate
charges related to terrorist bombings in northern Europe four years
ago.
   Prosecutor Ulf Forsberg said after the closed-door hearing in
Uppsala, 42 miles north of the capital Stockholm, that the clothes
were overlooked when police took 10 plastic bags of clothing from
Abu Talb's apartment in late November.
   District Court Judge Gunnar Graberg ruled the confiscation was
justified because Talb has been named in the Flight 103
investigation, said a court source, who declined to be identified.
   The source said Talb's defense lawyer challenged the latest
seizure in court, claiming it was not legally founded because the
suspicions against Talb were not strong enough.
   Police have said they investigated the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command and are interested in Talb,
a member of another radical Palestinian faction.
   Shreds of clothing found in the Lockerbie wreckage were traced
to a store on Malta, where Abu Talb visited two months before the
bombing.
   Police also seized clothes belonging to Abu Talb from the homes
of two other Palestinians in December.
   Abu Talb, who immigrated to Sweden in 1982, previously belonged
to the Damascus-based guerrilla organization Palestine Struggle
Front.
   Scottish detectives met Abu Talb in December, but he refused to
answer questions about his possible involvment in the Pan Am
bombing. Forsberg said the investigators have not tried to question
him again.
   Abu Talb's lawyer has appealed the conviction stemming from the
northern European bombings, and a retrial starts in the Appellate
Court on Feb. 12.

<HEAD>Investigators Say Noriega Fortune as Much as $300 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators said Manuel Antonio Noriega's
fortune could total as much as $300 million, though a Florida
newspaper said many assets cited don't belong directly to the
deposed Panamanian dictator.
   The Los Angeles Times on Monday quoted investigators it did not
name as saying Noriega's property and bank accounts could be worth
up to $300 million.
   The Miami Herald reported in Sunday editions that many assets
cited by investigators actually belong to Panama's defense forces
or are registered to businessmen close to Noriega.
   ``All these properties cited by the U.S. government exist but
were not his,'' said Mario Rognoni, a former commerce minister with
the Noriega regime. ``It's like saying that Camp David belongs to
(President) Bush.''
   A case in point, the Herald said, was a State Department
allegation that Noriega owned a Boeing 727 jet, three Lear jets and
three luxury boats named Macho I, Macho II and Macho III.
   Documents found in recent weeks suggest none of the planes and
boats may be traceable to Noriega, unidentified officials of the
U.S.-installed Panamanian government told the Herald.
   This may make it more difficult for the newly installed
administration of President Guillermo Endara to claim possession of
any Noriega holdings.
   Controller-General Ruben Carles said in a weekend interview the
government plans to mount a legal effort to win any possessions,
which The Los Angeles Times reported includes a $27-million castle
in the south of France and a sprawling estate in Sweden.
   Panama is hoping to retrieve some of the fortune to help with
its $5 billion debt to foreign creditors. Carles warned Panama must
reduce expenditures by about 17 percent to regain confidence of
lenders.
   Carles said the government may have to turn over to creditors a
significant portion of the $400 million in government funds that
have been held in U.S. banks since being frozen two years ago.
   Sources told the Times that Noriega's fortune was built partly
through a scheme in which Panamanian visas were sold for $10,000 to
as many as 18,000 Cuban and Chinese citizens desperate to leave
their countries.
   In addition, Noriega allegedly made millions in protection
payments from Colombian drug traffickers who used Panama to fly
drugs to the United States.
   The Times said members of a Drug Enforcement Administration team
have gathered 20 tons of documents in Panama, but could not
disclose any details.
   But sources indicated to the Times that Noriega's holdings are
scattered throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States.

Thwarted</HEAD>

   Delegates from the liberal republic
of Slovenia walked out of a Communist Party congress Monday after
being defeated on several key reform issues, and the split in the
party seemed to be irreconcilable.
   The congress adjourned without setting a date for reconvening
after leaders debated for nearly four hours at an emergency session
on how to handle the crisis.
   Delegations from the republics of Croatia, Macedonia and
Bosnia-Hercegovina indicated late Monday no possibility existed
that the congress could continue, the state Tanjug news agency
reported.
   Party President Milan Pancevski told exhausted delegates early
Tuesday that party leaders would keep working toward a solution and
asked regional party bodies to do the same.
   Delegates from Slovenia believe more autonomy should be granted
the six republics and two provinces in a nation that was held
together for decades by the will of President Tito, who died in
1980. Serbian Communists equate the party with the country and say
it must remain unified.
   The congress was due to end Tuesday.
   The walkout came as delegates were headed for a vote on a reform
policy document in which the party was to relinquish its
45-year-old, guaranteed monopoly on power.
   Earlier Monday, the congress cast a preliminary vote on giving
up its political stranglehold, but that vote was on a proposed
amendment to the draft text and was dependent on the document's
final adoption.
   The Slovenians complained hard-liners had watered down crucial
reform points and the final draft did not take into account the
republic's drive for greater independence.
   The split came after three days of bitter debate.
   Croatian party chief Ivica Racan demanded the congress suspend
its work. Otherwise, he said, Croatia's delegation would refuse to
vote on the reform document and other conference papers.
   President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, largest of the six
republics, said suspending work would cause the party to be
``practically disbanded and decapitated.''
   The congress took a 30-minute recess after Milosevic finished a
speech in which he warned of ``grave consequences for the Communist
Party and the future of the country.''
   He urged the remaining delegates to adopt the reform document
and choose a new leadership.
   Milan Kucan, a leading Slovenian Communist, told journalists the
breakup of the Communist Party ``is the only possible consequence
of this action.''
   Slovenian party spokesman Peter Bekes said his party would have
a regional party conference Feb. 2 and establish an ``independent
party on the basis of democratic socialism.''
   He predicted two or three parties would emerge from the split in
the national organization.
   Ciril Ribicic, leader of the Slovenian party, said before the
walkout the congress failed to accept any of his delegation's ideas
and ``we are not going to take part in the agony of the Communist
Party in Yugoslavia.''
   ``The document on which we pinned by far the highest hopes
turned out to be far below expectations and lagging behind reforms
offered by reform-minded leftist parties in socialist (East
European) countries.''
   Ribicic said the congress failed to acknowledge the
``independence, sovereignty and equality of Slovenia's Communist
Party.''
   Slovenia is the second smallest republic, with 2 million
residents. Serbia has 9 million people.
   Slovenia said it would take an ideological course independent of
the national party. Ribicic said the regional party had decided to
seek independence from the national organization.
   Communists in Slovenia proposed the national party become a
loose coalition of independent regional organizations, but Serbia
opposed it. Milosevic wants a strong central party.
   Delegates overwhelmingly favored asking Parliament to remove the
constitutional provision that guarantees a power monopoly.
   Party secretary Stefan Korosec told the congress the old model
of a monopolistic Communist system ``has no historical future.''
   Korosec, a Slovenian candidate for the party leadership, said
the end ``has come to authoritarian socialism.''
   He urged Communists to ``catch up on the pace of democratic
reforms'' in Europe and accept that they no longer are Yugoslavia's
sole political force. Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany,
Poland and Hungary have abolished the leading role of the Communist
Party in recent months, as part of their democratic reforms.
   Monday's amendment said the national party ``should transform
itself as soon as possible into a unified modern democratized
political organization.''
   Many delegates have recommended a split into a Socialist Party
in the Western European style and a traditional Communist Party.
   Dozens of independent groups have been formed the past year and
the government has pledged to pursue democratic reforms leading to
free, multiparty elections.

   In a move expected to trigger mass
defections, East Germany's No. 2 Communist and 39 other prominent
party members have abandoned the party that ruled East Germany
through intimidation for 40 years.
   The defectors called for the party's dissolution.
   Sunday's resignations immediately followed an emergency meeting
of the embattled Communist leadership, which expelled Egon Krenz,
the ousted leader who opened the Berlin Wall, along with 13 other
former Politburo members.
   They also coincided with a march by tens of thousands of
anti-Communist protesters across the border to West Germany and
back. Many marchers carried empty suitcases in the symbolic exodus.
   West Germany's ARD television said: ``They wanted to show how
many people are ready to leave the country in case the Communist
Party remains in power'' after parliamentary elections promised for

   Mayor Marion Barry is giving no thought to

top Barry aides say.
   Barry, his political career in shambles following his drug

   Vice President Dan Quayle, facing a possible
chilly reception in Latin America as he offers to explain the U.S.
invasion of Panama, would not be the first presidential emissary to
run into trouble in the region.
   Such esteemed former Latin America travelers as Nelson
Rockefeller, Richard Nixon and Rosalynn Carter were sent by
presidents on goodwill trips and all encountered stormy receptions
_ in some cases violence.
   Quayle leaves Saturday on a mission to try to quell the
resentment left in Central and South America by President Bush's
Dec. 20 military invasion of Panama.
   None of the countries in the region has officially rebuffed
Quayle, but some officials have let it be known his visit would be
less than welcome so soon after the invasion. Many are upset that
U.S. invasion troops remain in Panama.

   The U.S. government's acceptance of a plea bargain
by subsidiaries of the world's seventh-largest private bank for
laundering millions in drug money is being called a joke by some
critics.
   But other observers say the deal with the Bank of Commerce and
Credit International may be justified if it helps win a conviction
against deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.
   ``It seems like a light hit, but it depends on what the
government is going to get out of them. It could be they are
sitting on a wealth of information,'' said Robert Powis, a former
U.S. treasury official.
   The divisions of the Luxembourg-based bank pleaded guilty
Tuesday to about 30 charges, including tax fraud, money laundering
and failing to report currency transactions of more than $10,000.
   Originally charged with laundering $32 million in cocaine
profits, the bank agreed to forfeit only the $14 million that the
U.S. government was able to freeze during its ``Operation C-Chase''
investigation that began in 1986.

   During the Tony Awards last June, a parade of
producers bounded to center stage at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater to
accept honors for the best play and then best musical of the
1988-89 season.
   Keizo Saji, head of Japan's giant liquor company Suntory
International Corp., made the trip twice.
   He shared the spotlight with such veteran Broadway power brokers
as Gerald Schoenfeld and Bernard Jacobs of the Shubert Organization
and Emanuel Azenberg, who produces Neil Simon's plays in New York.
   Saji's presence underscored the increasingly heavy Japanese
involvement on Broadway. Suntory, through its co-production of Tony
winners such as ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' and ``The Heidi
Chronicles,'' which also won a Pulitzer Prize, has been the most
successful and visible company.
   But it isn't the only Japanese concern to take a chance on the
Broadway lottery. Among the foreign investors in New York theater
production have been TV Asahi and the Tokyo Broadcasting System, as
well as Haruki Kadokawa, owner of Kadokawa Publishing. Not all of
their investments were successful. Some lost money.
   Win or lose, Japanese participation in Broadway production is
growing. Of the 18 shows that opened on Broadway between September
and the end of 1989, seven productions _ ``Gypsy,'' ``City of
Angels,'' ``A Few Good Men,'' ``The Circle,'' ``Tru,'' ``The Secret
Rapture'' and ``3 Penny Opera'' _ had Japanese financial backing,
five by Suntory.
   ``I think it flows with all of the investments being made out of
Japan by the Japanese in real estate and other businesses,'' says
producer Barry Weissler, whose smash revival of ``Gypsy,'' starring
Tyne Daly, has money from Tokyo Broadcasting.
   ``They would also like to be in the entertainment business,''
Weissler says. ``So they have invested in records, film and now
live theater. And our American musical theater is an area they
can't duplicate in Japan. Since they want to play these pieces in
Japan, it serves them to be first in line for a potential
presentation there.''
   Suntory, Japan's largest privately held corporation, is the
biggest Japanese investor currently on Broadway through its equal
partnership agreement with the Shubert Organization. The agreement,
begun in 1988, runs into 1992. Each puts up equal amounts of money
and will share profits or losses equally.
   The Shuberts have a similar arrangement with Capital Cities-ABC.
The three organizations reportedly put up $1.5 million each for
``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' which had a total price tag of $8
million. Suntory plans to take the musical with its American cast
to Japan early next year.
   The Shubert-Suntory partnership has its roots in a 1982 tour of
Japan _underwritten by Suntory _ by the Broadway cast of
``Dancin'.'' The show, a collection of dances created by Bob Fosse,
was perfect for a foreign audience. No knowledge of English was
required, and much of the music, such as ``Sing, Sing, Sing,''
``Big Noise from Winnetka'' and ``Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' was
familiar in many places around the world.
   ``We maintained a contact through the years,'' says Schoenfeld,
chairman of the Shubert Organization, which owns a major share of
Broadway's theaters and has actively produced shows to fill them.
   ``In 1988, when we announced we were doing `Jerome Robbins'
Broadway,' Suntory contacted us. They were very, very impressed
with Robbins and this was before they saw anything or even knew
what the show was about. That led to a series of meetings and out
of them evolved a long-term relationship.''
   The agreement gives the Shubert Organization the right to select
the shows and there is no limit on the number of productions that
can be done each year, Schoenfeld says. Suntory, in turn, will
decide what shows they want to produce in Japan, depending on what
they think will be suitable for Japanese audiences.
   ``At this time, we don't have the knowledge to judge what
material will be successful or not successful on Broadway,'' says
Kenji Kishimoto, a Suntory vice president for marketing and sales.
``Maybe if there is a next phase to our relationship, we will.''
   In Japan, Suntory, with more than $6 billion in annual sales,
has been aggressive in promoting culture and sponsoring sporting
events.
   ``About 20 years ago, Mr. Saji, our president and chairman,
pledged that Suntory should be a company that enriches our daily
life,'' Kishimoto says. ``It's not only selling alcoholic
beverages, but some dream of enjoying your life.''

   Suntory, which is a major producer of pharmaceuticals as well as
whiskey and beer, built a major concert hall in downtown Tokyo, as
well as an art museum for traditional Japanese art. It holds annual
tennis and golf tournaments and sponsors a yearly jazz festival in
the mountain resort of Madarao. The company even constructed five
bird sanctuaries at its facilities throughout Japan in cooperation
with the Japanese Association for the Preservation of Birds.
   Suntory will have money in at least one more Shubert show this
season _ the Steppenwolf Theater Company's adaptation of John
Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath.'' It's among the more eagerly
awaited offerings of the year.
   American musicals have been performed in Japan with Japanese
casts for years. Audiences have long been familiar with ``My Fair
Lady'' and ``West Side Story.'' A Japanese-language version of
``Cats'' was a big success. So was ``Big River,'' based on Mark
Twain's ``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.'' The show even used
the original American star, Ron Richardson, who learned Japanese
for his role but sang most of his songs as the runaway slave Jim in
English.
   But Broadway musicals with American casts were new to Japan in
the early 1980s. Enormously expensive to produce because the
company and scenery had to be flown to Japan, they nevertheless
were able to generate prestige and enormous publicity if not
profits for the sponsoring company.
   ``There's a great promotional aspect to presenting shows in
Japan, much more than there is here,'' Schoenfeld says. ``There is
a corporate identification with a show in Japan. Audiences will
identify `Jerome Robbins' as the Suntory production of `Jerome
Robbins' Broadway' when it plays there in 1991.''
   After ``Dancin','' Suntory, among others, helped take an
American-cast version of ``Duke Ellington's Sophisticated Ladies''
to Japan. TV Asahi, one of Japan's biggest television networks,
sponsored a Weissler production of ``My One and Only,'' starring
Tommy Tune and Sandy Duncan. Next fall Weissler will send Topol to
Tokyo and Osaka in ``Fiddler on the Roof'' under the aegis of C.
Itoh, a major shipping conglomerate.
   ``Traditional corporate entertainment was always limited to men
in Japan, but with Broadway shows they could provide dinner and a
musical for a husband and wife,'' says Kenji Kitatani, a vice
president for Tokyo Broadcasting and a professor in
telecommunications management at Indiana University. ``It became a
new tool for large corporations to entertain clients or potential
clients. It was a new way of marketing.
   ``There is more money available in Japan now than ever before,
and all of those elements accelerated the boom of Broadway shows in
Japan.''
   But an investment in the American theater still remains an
uncertain opportunity, no matter who provides the money. Several
Japanese companies have been burned. The musical ``Blues in the
Night,'' done off-Broadway in 1988 with financial backing from TV
Asahi, closed after a short engagement.
   ``3 Penny Opera'' was one of the season's biggest critical and
financial flops. It dropped an estimated $4.5 million, including an
investment from Haruki Kadokawa, head of one of Japan's largest
publishing companies. ``The Secret Rapture'' by David Hare lost
$800,000, some of it Suntory money, during its brief two-week run.
   But Suntory does have an investment in ``City of Angels,'' the
Cy Coleman musical about a private eye in 1940s Los Angeles. It is
the season's biggest new musical hit and the likely Tony winner in
June. And the original cast recording rights have been won, after a
spirited bidding, by CBS Records, which now happens to be owned by
another Japanese company, Sony.
   Kitatani brought Tokyo Broadcasting into ``Gypsy,'' through his
association with one of the producers, Pace International. But
officials of the big Japanese television network only committed
themselves to the show after careful analysis of the property.
   ``The reason they did `Gypsy' was that they believed in it,''
Kitatani says. ``They researched the track record of the producers,
Barry and Fran Weissler. They looked at Tyne Daly's level of
acceptance in the United States and then, of course, they looked at
the past performance record of `Gypsy,' which has been done twice
before on Broadway.
   ``They felt very comfortable betting their money on the show.
You might think that when they are 5,000 miles away from Broadway
they don't study those things, but they do.''

   Miami Beach, once a popular playground by the
sea, the jewel of the Gold Coast, fell on hard times in the '80s as
its elderly retirees died off or moved away and tourists found
other places to take the sun. But don't write off this old dowager
of resort towns just yet. She's spruced herself up and the good
times are beginning to roll again.

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years ago Miami Beach officials
tried to block efforts to preserve the city's Art Deco hotels and
apartment houses with their decorative architecture so popular in
the late 1920s and 1930s.
   But the preservationists won out and today Miami Beach is
enjoying an economic and cultural renaissance tied to the funky,
colorful buildings.
   After the ``Miami Vice'' television series introduced much of
America to the fanciful Art Deco revival look in 1983, the city
poured more than $100 million into renovation projects.
   But only recently have developers seen profits in neighborhoods
recovering from decades of neglect.
   Now South Beach, the southernmost part of Miami Beach, is in the
midst of a full-scale building boom. On every block, apartments and
hotels are being repainted or restored.
   ``It's very exciting,'' says Richard Hoberman, chairman of the
Miami Design Preservation League. ``This city has come to
appreciate the benefits of historic preservation.''
   A five-year, $5.6 million plan to expand scenic Ocean Drive into
a promenade lined by cafes and nightclubs was completed in time for
the annual Art Deco Weekend Jan. 12-14, when an estimated 300,000
people jammed the street, dancing to swing bands, eating ethnic
foods and buying antiques.
   On Lincoln Road, the Miami City Ballet, the New World Symphony
Orchestra and a dozen art galleries have taken up residence in
buildings left vacant when glamorous stores moved out in the 1960s
and '70s.
   The city is cashing in on this cultural reawakening by making it
easy for moviemakers and fashion magazines to operate in the
district. Any weekday, a half-dozen film crews can be seen taking
advantage of the splashy colors, palm trees and near-constant sun.
   ``It's a great industry to have. It's clean, attractive and it's
great advertising you can't buy. You can't open a major magazine
nowadays without seeing the Beach,'' says Jud Kurlancheek, Miami
Beach's city planner.
   Kurlancheek smiles now, but in his 13 years with the city, he's
seen Miami Beach at its worst.
   The resort town so fashionable in the 1950s was all but
abandoned when its increasingly elderly residents died off or moved
away and younger people looked beyond Florida for their tropical
vacations.
   The decline worsened in 1980, when Cuban vagrants and criminals
from the Mariel boatlift flocked to South Beach to take advantage
of depressed rents.
   But economic indicators now show Miami Beach has turned around.
   In the past five years, resort tax revenues, hotel occupancy
rates, vehicle registrations and the numbers of children going to
public schools have been rising continually, says Kurlancheek, who
credits Art Deco restoration work for the upswing.
   And in September, the city commission approved zoning changes
that will accommodate an expansion of the city's now-strict
preservation laws to protect almost every building south of Lincoln
Road, as well as the museum district north of Lincoln, between the
Miami Beach Convention Center and the ocean.
   It adds up to more than 1,500 hotels, apartment buildings,
stores and homes, 70 percent of which have Art Deco flourishes.
   The proposed local historic districts, which must survive
several more public hearings before final approval, also would
allow developers to build huge hotels near the convention center,
gut the inside of some low-rise historic hotels and put trendy
shops and ``dramatic spaces'' behind the facades.
   City officials call it a fair compromise that will enable Miami
Beach to build the 6,000 new first-class hotel rooms it needs to
win major conventions.
   While some hotels successfully cater to the film crews and
others target Europeans who are tired of the crowds on the French
Riviera and eager to take advantage of a sagging U.S. dollar, the
niche of tourists attracted to the smaller, Bohemian hotels can
only do so much for the city, officials say.
   Some preservationists disagree.
   ``It's a complete sellout to developers,'' said Barbara Baer
Capitman, who founded the Miami design firm MDPL in 1976 and is now
the president of the Art Deco Societies of America. ``We have no
reason to compromise when we're so strong after so much was won at
such a cost.''
   Mrs. Capitman led a small group of preservationists that
overcame the opposition of the city manager and the Chamber of
Commerce and got 20 blocks of South Beach listed on the National
Register of Historic Places in 1979. It's the only district on the
register that has 20th century architecture.
   She gave her life's savings as seed money to her son, Andrew,
who bought seven run-down hotels for $7 million in the early 1980s
and began rehabilitation efforts.
   The Carlyle, Cardozo, Tides, Leslie, Cavalier, Victor and
Senator were considered among the finest examples of Tropical Art
Deco architecture. But tourists and additional financing were slow
to arrive, and by 1983 a cash crunch forced them to sell everything
to the Philadelphia-based Royale Group.
   Royale drew the wrath of preservationists when it demolished the
Senator to make way for a parking lot. The development company has
been mired in legal trouble with its lenders ever since.
   Despite $28.3 million secured from a California thrift,
renovation of the landmark hotels is far from complete. Unpaid
interest has increased Royale's debt to $35 million, according to
FCA Mortgage, the thrift's subsidiary. A federal judge recently
cleared the way for the hotels to be auctioned off.
   Selling the ``painted ladies of the historic district'' could be
a boon to South Beach, which has been hampered somewhat by
uncertainty about Royale's intentions, said Denis Russ, executive
director of the Miami Beach Development Corp.
   ``This may unleash the potential for development,'' Russ said.
``It will be wonderful if they all come back to life.''

   A profession once dominated by men appears about
to be taken over by women. Women have overtaken men enrolled in the
nation's veterinary schools over the past few years and if the
trend continues they are the ones who will be doing the hiring and
firing in the future.

   Dr. Mary Beth Leininger, her face wet
from the kisses of a white terrier puppy she is about to vaccinate,
remembers when women were highly outnumbered by men in veterinary
schools.
   Now the pendulum is swinging the other way. Just ask the
reigning Miss America, Debbye Turner, who soon will join the ranks
of women like Leininger tending to the medical needs of the
nation's animals.
   Leininger, who owns and operates a veterinary hospital in this
Detroit suburb with her husband, Dr. Steven Leininger, is one of
about 10,000 women veterinarians in the nation, according to the
American Veterinary Medical Association.
   Though Leininger has been a veterinarian for more than 20 years,
her 1967 class at Purdue University, with its seven women, was
typical _ about 93 percent male. It was a time when openings in the
schools were scarce, and not many women enrolled.
   ``The thought was, they are taking the place of a man who would
practice all his life,'' she says. ``That certainly has not been
borne out. All seven women who were in my class are still working
in the profession.''
   Women now outnumber men in the nation's 27 veterinary colleges,
said Dr. John Tasker, dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at
Michigan State University.
   The trend started in 1983 when 50.1 percent of the applicants
were women, Tasker says. The next year, for the first time, the
entering class had more women than men. The percentage of
first-year women students has increased every year since, reaching
58.9 percent in 1988.
   Of 8,751 students enrolled in U.S. colleges of veterinary
medicine in 1987, 55 percent, or 4,816, were women, and 45 percent,
or 3,935, were men. If the trend continues, the profession could
become one of the first to change from being predominantly male to
predominantly female.
   The number of women now being trained as veterinarians is
extraordinary, says Dr. Dee Jacobson, a veterinarian in Berkeley,
Calif., and president of the 400-member Association for Women
Veterinarians founded in the 1940s.
   ``The profession is just beginning to acknowledge the tremendous
shift that has occurred,'' says Jacobson, a 1967 graduate of
California State University at Davis.
   Women in the veterinary profession got some added exposure in
September when Debbye Turner, a senior studying veterinary medicine
at the University of Missouri in Columbia, was named Miss America.
   Turner, who estimates that about half the students in her class
are women, says the salary gap between men and women veterinarians
also has begun to close.
   ``I didn't pursue veterinary medicine to get rich, and anyone
who does that is a disillusioned person,'' Turner says. ``It is a
profession based on compassion. That was my motivation. I loved
animals.''
   Turner says she decided to become a veterinarian after she spent
a summer ``shadowing a veterinarian'' as a 13-year-old. And she
says she won't forsake her ambition, even for a lucrative modeling
contract or a job delivering the evening news on TV.
   The average starting salary for veterinarians was $22,181 a year
in 1988, according to a survey by J. Karl Wise of Schaumburg, Ill.
   Wise, whose study was published this year in the Journal of the
American Veterinary Medical Association, reported that the average
starting salary is about 29 percent higher than in 1980, but is
only slightly higher after inflation is figured in.
   The average annual salary for veterinarians in private practice
in 1987 was $52,643, with veterinarians specializing in horses
earning an average of $60,653.
   Jacobson contends stagnant salaries among veterinarians caused
potential male students to seek other higher-paying biomedical
jobs. Bright women students, who traditionally are less concerned
with salary, filled the gap.
   The size of the applicant pool for veterinary medical college
decreased 43 percent between 1980 and 1988, and this year it's down
to 1.79 applicants per position.
   ``Getting in is the easiest it's been since World War II,'' says
Billy Hooper, executive director of the Association of American
Veterinary Medical Colleges.
   Dr. Paul Dieterlen in Napanee, Ind., where he and his partner
take care of large and small animals, has watched the number of
veterinarians shrink.
   The last time he went looking to hire a newly graduated
veterinarian he wrote to the veterinary medical colleges at Iowa
State, Ohio State, Michigan State, Illinois and Purdue. The
response for the $26,000-a-year job was disappointing, he says.
   Dieterlen says a male Purdue graduate eventually filled the
opening, but one of the agreements in the contract was that his
wife, also a veterinarian, would get to do some part-time work.
That was fine with him.
   ``They are saving our skin,'' he says. ``If we didn't have the
women in veterinary medicine we'd have half the students we have
now, or we'd have less-qualified men. They are going to be a major
force.''

   Stiltsville is on its last legs. The cluster of
rustic vacation homes rising out of Florida's Biscayne Bay will
have to come down by the turn of the century, by decree of the
government. For people like Thatcher Edmunds, it will be a paradise
lost.

<DATELINE>BISCAYNE NATIONAL PARK, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thatcher Edmunds recalls
back in the early 1960s when the stilt structures dotting the flats
of Biscayne Bay were notorious hangouts for gamblers, boozers and
flashy women.
   Characters such as Plucky Pierre and his right-hand man,
Shipwreck Kelly, ran a joint called The Bikini Club, where a pink
card gained entry for members any time of day or night.
   Seamen found their way to the Quarterdeck Club, which was fully
equipped with a bar, table games, and, for a time, slot machines.
   ``Ours, though, was strictly for family,'' says Edmunds, who
calls his dwelling on stilts the ``A house.''
   So-named because of its distinctive A-frame architecture, the
faded yellow retreat sits in several feet of water along with 13
other such vacation homes and weekend retreats off the southern
coast of Key Biscayne.
   Pleasure boaters cruising Biscayne Bay can hardly miss the stilt
homes that have become a veritable Miami landmark.
   Curious Miamians and visitors alike pass through Stiltsville's
natural deep-water channels en route to the ocean and sometimes
leave slashes in the sea grasses after dragging their engines on
the bay bottom in the clear, shallow water around the homes.
   But even with its reputation considerably mellowed and more
family oriented, Stiltsville will no longer exist at the turn of
the century.
   Residents' leases for quarter-acre underwater sites won't be
renewed after July 1, 1999, by decree of the Florida Cabinet. The
state allowed the bay bottom to be leased through the next decade
but prohibited new construction after the Legislature passed the
Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve Act in 1974.
   ``We are taking this area, which is close to a large urban area,
and returning it to its natural state,'' says Lisa Garvin,
spokeswoman for the 173,000-acre Biscayne National Park.
   Although some people have called Stiltsville an eyesore and
environmental concerns have been raised, Edmunds and others say the
homes should be saved.
   ``Maybe they're jealous because they can't build,'' Edmunds
says. ``We were there long before it was a national park. We're not
bothering anyone.''
   Edmunds, 61, a retired trucking company supervisor from Pembroke
Pines, shares the retreat with three other families. The 40-by
50-foot, three-bedroom house, about six miles offshore from Miami
and a mile from the Cape Florida lighthouse, has stood for 27
years. Hurricane Donna leveled the original structure.
   Residents now can rebuild homes damaged during storms only if at
least 51 percent of the structure remains intact.
   It took about a year for the families to build the A-frame house
themselves, towing scrap lumber and materials to the site in small
outboards.
   ``It was almost like homesteading,'' Edmunds says.
   In 1965, he says, Ivan Tower Studios featured the house as the
base of operations for an underwater coal mining company in the
move ``Round the World Under the Sea.'' Church groups and Boy
Scouts also have borrowed the place for special retreats.
   Don't expect any luxuries here, Edmunds says, though it's the
best getaway possible still within sight of the Miami skyline.
   ``You never run out of things to do _ relax, fish, water-ski,
dive, or watch the boats go by,'' he says.
   There is no television, no telephone. They catch rainwater for
showers and washing dishes. Generators provide electricity, and the
breeze off the bay provides ``the world's best air conditioning,''
Edmunds says as he throws open the wooden doors off the combination
sitting room-kitchen-dining area.
   The bay, its water patches of light green and indigo blue, used
to offer some of the best bonefishing anywhere before Miami's
population boomed, Edmunds says. But despite the decline in marine
life, it's still easy to catch a panful of fish for supper.
   ``You can cast off the porch any time you want and catch all the
fish you want,'' Edmunds says.
   Old pictures from family outings cram a large bulletin board
inside the wooden house, many of them showing bloody sharks bigger
than the young boys who caught them.
   Over the course of about 60 years, residents of Stiltsville have
often helped boaters who became stranded or got caught in a bad
storm.
   ``Through the years I can't imagine how many I've pulled off the
flats or helped them repair their boats or towed them in,'' Edmunds
says.
   Residents pay the state Department of Natural Resources $1,000
annually to lease the site. When the first structures began shaping
Stiltsville, the bay bottom was leased for $1 an acre. The
community peaked after World War II, with some 20 residences.
   Today, some of the structures have fallen into disrepair after
years of constant exposure to wind and salt spray.
   Edmunds says it's a constant battle to keep up his retreat,
replacing beams, painting and making repairs. He worries about
Stiltsville's possible deterioration in the next decade because
owners may decide it's not worth spending the money for repairs if
they'll have to move or tear down the residences.
   If the state remains committed to eliminating Stiltsville,
Edmunds says, it'll do more than just take away a slice of paradise
for owners in the area.
   ``It'll take away a lot of pleasure for people who visit,'' he
says. ``It's just the neatest place in the world.''

   Boots, boots, boots, marching up and down again.
But don't take them for granted. Here's a man who makes his living
making cowboy boots, and if you have a thousand bucks, he'll even
make one out of ostrich for you.

   His stubby, stained fingers caress the dark
leather as Jim Pope slowly forms two pieces together, gluing here
and there. Under his careful hands a cowboy boot begins to take
shape.
   ``You can't get rich doing this,'' he says. ``I do it because I
enjoy doing it, and the satisfaction of seeing some old boy who
says he can't get boots to fit slip on a pair I've made and walk
out of here with a smile on his face.''
   But not just anyone can afford a visit to Pope's shop. Prices
start at about $400, half up front. But, as Pope says, ``for the
exotic leathers, you better get out your big checkbook.''
   The customer has a choice of leathers, from calf at the low end
to shark and snake at around $550, full-quill ostrich at about
$1,000 and alligator at $1,500 to $1,600.
   ``I made one pair out of armadillo and another out of
bullfrog,'' he says. ``I have enough elephant to make one more pair
of boots, and then that's gone.''
   Pope says he demands a 50 percent deposit ``because I have to
buy the leather. A full-quill ostrich hide costs about $700 and I
can't afford to just keep it around.''
   The amount of stitching on the uppers, and whether there's any
inlay, also can run up the cost. He just delivered a pair of boots
to a Texas banker that has the outline of that state inset in the
uppers.
   ``I give the customer four rows of stitching,'' Pope says. ``If
they want more, it's $25 a row.''
   Pope says that besides looking pretty, the stitching helps keep
the uppers standing straight.
   ``It takes about 40 hours to make a pair of boots,'' he says.
``It depends on how fancy they are, some more, some less, but it
averages out to about 40 hours.''
   ``I've had them ask me to include a little hidden place for
money,'' Pope says. ``Others want a place to carry a gun.''
   Rows of leather are stacked on an overhead shelf and virtually
every inch of the portable building that serves as office and
workshop is filled with some sort of shoe-making machine. A
window-style air conditioner at the rear fights a standstill battle
with the humid, 90 degrees-plus heat.
   Pope says he is one of only two custom bootmakers still in
business in Oklahoma City.
   ``The young people coming along, they don't want to work this
hard for no more money than they get,'' he says.
   Pope says he did some work for movie actors who were in the area
recently making the film ``Homegrown.''
   ``I redid some boots for Scott Glenn, the star,'' Pope says.
``He had those pointy-toed boots and I rounded them off.''
   Pope got into the boot-making business in a roundabout way. He
worked with leather, making belts and wallets and repairing
saddles, when he was a ranch hand.
   ``But if anybody had told me then I'd be making boots today, I
would have said they're crazy,'' he says.
   Pope takes about a half-dozen measurements of a customer's foot
and draws an outline on a piece of paper. He uses wooden lasts ``as
close to the man's size as possible'' and either builds up with
leather or shaves the wood off until he has as near a perfect match
for the foot as is possible. The foot part of the boot is formed
over that.
   ``I don't give a money-back guarantee, but I do guarantee that
you'll have a boot to fit,'' he says.
   There was a time when the boot-making business was almost as
good as most people think owning an oil well is. That was back in
the early 1980s when everyone believed there was no top to the
spiraling cost of oil.
   ``You commonly ran 75 to 100 orders behind, several month's
worth,'' the 47-year-old Pope says.
   But with the oil bust, the flamboyant ``oilies'' and the bankers
who backed them faded away, along with the wild parties where beer
toasts were drunk from the fancy boots.
   Now, he says, he makes five or six pairs a month, sometimes
seven.
   ``The bust has hurt all the custom-made leather work,'' says
Pope, who learned the trade at the Oklahoma State Technical
Institute. ``Leggings, saddles, all that sort of thing, they're all
hurting.
   ``But the repair business has stayed pretty good.''

   Choosing the right thermal underwear today
requires some careful study. Long johns are no longer just long
johns. A variety of synthetic fabrics has largely replaced the
cotton and wool garments, and what you should buy depends on what
you plan to do.

   Long johns just ain't what they used to be. And
that's good news for the consumer.
   Today there is a wide variety of high-tech replacements for the
old scratchy, bulky, shrunken underwear.
   Choices range from silk to polypropylene, from trademarked
synthetic fabrics like Lifa, Thermax and Capilene to cotton, wool
and synthetic blends.
   ``Underwear is a specialized product today, vs. what it used to
be,'' says Jim Jennings, product manager for Lands' End, a direct
mail retailer based in Dodgeville, Wis. ``You really have to
determine the activity before you buy.''
   Kevin Sweeney of Patagonia, a sportwear manufacturer in Ventura,
Calif., agrees. ``People used to say, underwear is underwear. But
then we said, why don't we make it perform? And then we said, why
don't we make it fun?''
   Sweeney defines fun as thermals in such untraditional colors as
neon orange with navy trim, or emerald with purple trim.
   Thermal underwear used to be made of 100 percent cotton, with a
small amount made of 100 percent wool, says Tom Armstrong, product
research and testing manager for L.L. Bean in Freeport, Maine.
   But an explosion of synthetic fabrics changed that situation for
the better about 10 years ago, he says.
   ``There has been a trend toward more man-made fibers,'' says Bob
Blanchard, president of National Knitwear Manufacturers Association
in Morristown, N.J., which tracks national wholesale thermal sales.
   ``It is now well over half the market, where 10 years ago it
would have been at least 80 percent all cotton.''
   ``Cotton alone is useless in a really cold environment,'' says
Armstrong, who oversees a textile lab as well as 400 field testers
around the world. ``Its high absorbency is its downfall. In
essence, it freezes if you stop in winter.
   ``Wool is great. The old expeditions to the Arctic or the
Himilayas relied on wool. But some people find them itchy, and they
don't dry out very well.''
   What thermal underwear a person chooses today depends on what
they do and how cold it's going to get around them.
   For cross-country skiers, lumberjacks and backpackers _ or
anyone who will work up a sweat in the cold _ Armstrong recommends
polypropylene, because of its ability to wick moisture away from
the body, keeping wearers warm and dry.
   But ice fishers, stadium fans, vendors and some hunters _ or
anyone who spends several hours still in the cold _ should get
heavier, double-ply cotton-wool-synthetic blended thermals,
Armstrong says.
   Even sports names like Nike and Patagonia have entered the
previously unglamorous field.
   People who want to wear the same thermals as space shuttle
astronauts can choose Capilene underwear by Patagonia, in three
different weights. Nike also offers three different weights of
thermals in its All Conditions Gear line.
   But what weight to choose?
   ``If you're standing still in the cold _ like a ski race judge _
buy expedition-weight,'' Sweeney says. ``If you're cross-country
skiing, buy mid-weight.
   ``If you're wearing it under your clothes, buy lightweight.''
   Those who do a variety of outdoor activities are a retailer's
dream.
   ``If you are both passive and active, you can't use just one set
of underwear,`` Jennings says.
   In the natural fibers, silk is now king, chosen for its soft,
light texture.
   ``Silk is the top-of-the-line,'' Jennings says. ``People use it
to sleep in, for layering, anywhere you don't want to be
encumbered.''
   If the bulk and itch of earlier thermals are gone, what about
the tight fit? It seems that shrinkage problems may be a thing of
the past as well.
   ``Normal shrinkage is 5 percent to 7 percent,'' Armstrong says.
``But we build in that size buffer. If you put it on right from the
box it would be a little big. Our people fit the garment so it fits
correctly after washing.''

   During the filming of NBC's ``Murder in
Mississippi'' in Georgia, Tom Hulce slipped away to get a feel of
the real-life locations where three civil rights workers were
abducted and killed in 1964.
   Hulce plays Mickey Schwerner in the two-hour movie, which NBC
will televise on Monday. Blair Underwood is James Chaney and Josh
Charles is Andrew Goodman. Jennifer Grey also stars as Schwerner's
wife, Rita.
   Schwerner was a social worker who went from New York to join
Chaney, Goodman and others in a voter registration drive in
Mississippi.
   Their deaths near Philadelphia, Miss., helped change the course
of the civil rights movement. The story tells of the events leading
up to the murders during the so-called ``Freedom Summer.'' The FBI
investigation of the deaths and its aftermath was told in the
feature movie ``Mississippi Burning.''
   ``Blair, Jennifer and I went to Meridian, where they were based
in Mississippi,'' Hulce says. ``They were having a memorial for the
25th anniversary and it was a wonderful opportunity to see and hear
a lot of people in the movement. I wanted to travel the same roads
they had traveled the day they died. You just have to look around
and it's much easier to climb into the story.
   ``We shot a good portion of the story in territory that still
has an active Ku Klux Klan. We were very low-key about what we were
doing, but it got a little real sometimes. We re-created a riot to
integrate employment at a department store. Not all of the crowd
activities were scripted. It's amazing how people know what to
say.''
   Hulce, an Oscar nominee for his role as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
in ``Amadeus,'' most recently was seen in ``Parenthood.'' He has
completed a role in the upcoming movie ``Black Rainbow'' and was
the brain-damaged garbage collector in ``Dominick &amp; Eugene.''
   After doing ``Murder in Mississippi'' he returned to New York
where he is now starring on Broadway in Aaron Sorkin's ``A Few Good
Men,'' a courtroom drama about a Marine Corps murder.
   ``I wore a goatee for the role because people in Mississippi
called Mickey the `Jew with the beard,''' Hulce says. ``I think
they had a specific agenda for his future. He was the one they
wanted the most because he was an outsider. Chaney was from
Mississippi and Goodman didn't come to Mississippi until the day he
was killed.
   ``Mickey's singular ability was to make everyone feel
comfortable with him. He was excellent in making people feel good
about themselves. The segregationists felt threatened by his
presence.''
   The movie begins when Schwerner arrives in Mississippi to help
organize the black voter drive. As an outsider, he is immediately
confronted by suspicion and bigotry. Schwerner and Chaney take time
to forge a good working relationship in the movie, but in reality
they were already good friends.
   ``Segregationists usually tend to be portrayed as morons,''
Hulce says. ``These were intelligent people who believed they are
right. There were people in positions of influence who were willing
to help them. Mickey had been threatened. A black church they used
as a headquarters was burned. He knew the risks, but he believed
strongly in what he was doing.''
   Hulce grew up in Michigan and studied at the North Carolina
School of the Arts. He made his Broadway debut opposite Anthony
Perkins in ``Equus.'' He had begun as understudy to Peter Firth,
who also played the role in the movie version. The play was written
by Peter Shaffer, and when it came time to cast the movie
adaptation of his play ``Amadeus,'' Hulce became a contender and
was selected over some heavy competition.
   In ``Parenthood,'' he plays the son of Jason Robards. ``He's a
guy who's in pursuit of the deal,'' he says. ``He has a gambling
problem. I'm a parent, too, in the picture. I have an illegitimate
child.''
   He also appears with Jason Robards in ``Black Rainbow,'' as well
as Rosanna Arquette.
   ``I play the hotshot lawyer in `A Few Good Men' who's assigned
to defend a Marine accused of murder,'' he says. ``It involves a
cover-up involving a Marine on the upper end of the ladder.''
   Hulce also has a home in Seattle.
   ``I have a house with a sidewalk in front of it,'' he says,
``which is a new experience for me. I grew up in the country. I had
a place in New York but now I can feel like a part of the
community. I'd worked in a play in Seattle and stayed. I found
myself in a Realtor's office. Before I knew it I was in a bar being
shown the neighborhood.''

   Leigh Lawson and Dustin Hoffman dreamed up the
idea of spitting on each other during their performance of ``The
Merchant of Venice.''
   It wasn't Shakespeare's idea, nor the director's.
   Lawson plays the merchant, Antonio, and Hoffman is the
moneylender, Shylock, in the Shakespearean play at Broadway's 46th
Street Theater.
   ``Spitting isn't written in the play,'' Lawson says.
   Before the play opened at London's Phoenix Theater last June,
Lawson and Hoffman worked on the scene in which Antonio borrows
3,000 ducats from Shylock and promises to give the Jewish
moneylender a pound of flesh if he doesn't pay the money back.
   ``We were improvising the scene, not doing Shakespeare's words,
just finding the chemistry of the scene,'' Lawson says.
   That's when the spitting started. The director, Sir Peter Hall,
bought the idea.
   Lawson accepted the title role, he says, because Sir Peter is
``brilliant with Shakespeare. This is a very clear production. He
makes the story very clear. All of us feel we'd like to do more
Shakespeare as a result of this experience.''
   Lawson considers Antonio a product of the anti-Semitism of his
times in Renaissance Italy.
   ``But the play is relevant today,'' he says. ``I was talking to
Dustin the night before last. He said, `Wasn't it incredible that
people started to applaud when I spit on you just before I was
going to cut your heart out!' It's amazing that feelings run so
strong and heated after 400 years. It would surely give old Bill
Shakespeare quite a thrill if he could come back and see it.''
   Some find the play anti-Semitic, which surprises Lawson.
   ``It has anti-Semitic people in it,'' he says. ``But it has that
brilliant `Hath not a Jew eyes' speech. To me the people that come
out the most obnoxious are the Christians. Asked to give mercy,
they take all Shylock's money and say he has to convert.
   ``Two people end up alone at the end, Shylock and Antonio.
They're the ones motivated by money.''
   Lawson, a native of Atherstone in Warwickshire, 20 miles from
Stratford on Avon, is playing his first major Shakespearean role in
some 15 years. It's also his American debut. He hopes that he and
his wife, Twiggy, who starred in ``My One and Only'' here, can play
Broadway together. They married in 1988 and her billing now is
Twiggy Lawson.
   Lawson is best known to Americans in movies _ as Alec
D'urberville, opposite Nastassia Kinski, in ``Tess'' and as Ronnie
Blum in ``Madame Sousatzka,'' with Shirley MacLaine.
   Although he can learn pages of Shakespeare's dialogue in an
evening, Lawson hasn't been in a Shakespeare company. After
attending the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, he decided not to go
to the Royal Shakespeare Company, where actors start with tiny
parts and work up.
   ``I decided I couldn't bear to stand around for two years,'' he
says. So he went to a repertory company in Coventry, where he'd do
larger parts right away. ``I auditioned for Franco Zeffirelli's
film `Brother Son Sister Moon,' the story of St. Francis of
Assisi,'' he says. ``I had it written in my repertory contract that
I could be released at a month's notice for this film. I managed to
do two seasons before that film got started. That gave me a year in
Italy where I completed my education in wine and food, and started
a film career.''
   Lawson also spent two years in leading roles at the National
Theater.
   ``There's a mystical thing that happens between audience and
actors on the stage,'' he says.
   When he's in an audience, Lawson wants to hear every word.
   ``To listen to actors who think they can give TV performances in
the theater drives me potty,'' he says. ``The Olivier Theater at
the National is a big space to fill. It's not a case of shouting.
It's a case of articulating so your consonants zing to the back of
the auditorium.
   ``Dame Edith Evans came to speak to us as students. She said
one's voice should be a powder puff shot by a cannon. That image
often comes to mind when I'm on stage.''
   When he isn't performing or attending plays, Lawson says, ``My
favorite nights are sitting around talking about theater with
theater people. There is usually somebody funny, somebody
intelligent, somebody drunk. It does throw up an eclectic crowd. I
find it endlessly fascinating.''
   Lawson has a son, Ace, 13, and Twiggy has a daughter, Carly, 11.
``We share them,'' Lawson says. ``They adore each other.''
   The Lawsons met at a dinner given by an actor friend in London.
``We were both unattached,'' he says. ``Twigs looked gorgeous. I
was a bit shy to ask for her phone number, thinking everybody asks
for her number. She says she was a bit miffed that I didn't.''
   They next saw each other when he went out for a morning paper
and she was delivering Carly to school across the street from his
flat. Their courtship was gentle, he says, going to the theater,
talking about saving the environment and seeing friends.
   ``It was like the fates were bringing us together.''

<TEXT>
   For Petar Dertliev, the changes seeping
through Bulgaria have meant a return to battling Communists. The
last time he lost.
   That was more than 40 years ago when the Communists crushed his
Social Democratic Party and sent him off to a labor camp and prison
for 10 years.
   The Communists still hold an upper hand in Bulgaria but in one
respect the tables have turned for Dertliev: Todor Zhivkov,
Bulgaria's longtime Communist Party leader, is under house arrest
on charges of incitement of ethnic hostility, misuse of state
property and malfeasance in office.
   After Zhivkov's ouster Nov. 10, Dertliev, now 73, wasted no time
calling a dozen former mates of the dark Stalinist days in
confinement and reactivating his party, which the Communists,
through an unexplained oversight, simply forgot to ban and now was
still legal.
   Membership is already 30,000 nationwide _ 10,000 in this capital
_ and Dertliev has a seat at round table talks where 12 opposition
groups negotiate with the Communists for more democracy.
   But Dertliev, like many Bulgarians, is skeptical that the
Communists really want to relinquish the power they acquired by
ruthless repression after World War II.
   ``We should not fall into the illusion that they will collapse
immediately, even though they are demoralized,'' the trim, retired
physician said in an interview. ``The advantages of having real
power are keeping them on their toes.''
   Unlike their comrades elsewhere in Eastern Europe, Bulgaria's
Communists appear confident they can hold on to a good share of
power after free elections, which they promise for May but the
still weak opposition wants held off until November.
   Petar Mladenov, the longtime foreign minister who took over as
president and party chief from Zhivkov, has not cut a high public
profile since losing his temper before an angry crowd of opposition
backers outside Parliament in December.
   But his No. 2 man, Andrey Lukanov, is a skilled political
operator and third generation Communist who speaks six foreign
languages and was born and educated in Moscow. Lukanov, who heads
the Communist team at the round table, has exuded confidence that
his party could win a majority in the elections.
   Dertliev thinks the Communists would get 25 percent to 30
percent of the vote if elections were held now, while some Western
diplomats believe they are just as unpopular as those elsewhere in
Eastern Europe and would fail miserably at the ballot box.
   The Communists are trying hard, however. They have so far
refused to relinquish their control over newspapers, television and
radio, while promising the opposition a daily publication, although
limiting its circulation to one-tenth that of their own newspapers.
   Lukanov has encouraged the formation of liberal, almost social
democratic factions inside the Communist Party, apparently hoping
these will attract people who might otherwise join Dertliev's party
or another opposition group.
   Dertliev and other activists say they have found, on more than
one occasion, that the well-informed Communists skillfully
preempted opposition victories by simply making opposition demands
their own platform.
   Recalling one case, he said, ``We decided in the morning to call
for the resignations of certain ministers.'' By afternoon, he
added, the Communist Party announced the ministers were fired.
   To some outside the party, such tactics could indicate the
divided Communists are following, rather than directing, the drift
of Bulgaria's politics, at least at this stage.
   Dertliev notes, however, that the Bulgarian Communist Party,
which predates even the Soviet Communist Party, has strong
traditions that go back to the last century and was a
well-organized underground body during Fascist rule in World War II.
   Today the Communists number about 900,000, or 10 percent of the
total population, but they have formally relinquished their
guaranteed leading role.
   The words ``socialism'' and ``communism,'' however, still appear
throughout the Bulgarian constitution, an intricate 1971 document
that outlines strict state controls over everything from foreign
trade to authors' copyrights; it even gives a minute description
mandating the appearance of the national emblem.
   Dertliev thus sees his fight as one of the still-weak (the
Social Democrats) against the still-strong (the Communists).
   ``The Communists have at their disposal all the machinery,'' he
said. ``What we have is the good will of the people on our side.''
   Mindful of the repression that wiped out the popular Social
Democratic Party and one anti-Communist faction of the Bulgarian
Agrarian Union in the 1940s, Dertliev and other opposition figures
now seek legal guarantees that one-party rule will not return.
   The repression descended on Bulgaria with terrifying force after
World War II, with party leader Georgi Dmitrov ruthlessly doing
away with opponents before his death in 1949.
   Some of his victims now are being rehabilitated. But it remains
taboo to link the repression directly to Dmitrov, whose embalmed
body lies, as Lenin's does in Moscow, in a mausoleum where the
Communists hold parades on May Day and other important days.
   In 1946, Dertliev was 30 years old and one of the 101 Social
Democrats sitting in a 400-member Parliament.
   He recalled the repression.
   ``Massive persecution'' and rigging elections were already under
way by 1945-46, he said. ``The terror then continued and
increased,'' with the arrest of Social Democrat Krastyo Pastuhov
and other party leaders.
   Pastuhov ``was sentenced for five years for just two (written)
articles,'' Dertliev said. While in prison, he was strangled by a
cellmate.
   Sveta Ivanov, sent to a labor camp for writing just one article
urging Bulgaria not to sever all its ties with the West, was
another who died. So did Lyudmila Slavova, who was reported to have
committed suicide while awaiting trial in 1947, the year other
leading Social Democrats were sentenced to terms of 15, 12 and 10
years.
   Dertliev got 10 years.
   ``My wife was 21, and my baby 4 months,'' Dertliev recalled with
a smile tinged with bitterness. ``When I came back, she was already
in the third class at school.''
   Although the Social Democratic Party was not formally banned _
Dertliev says this was because ``the Communists thought they would
stay in power forever'' _ he and others knew it was impossible to
return to politics.
   Dertliev worked for eight years in the obscurity of a sanatorium
for tubercular children in the mountains of central Bulgaria.
   Little by little, he made his way back to Sofia where he
maintained quiet contacts with old cellmates.
   Now, brimming with humor and energy, he wants to build a
democratic Bulgaria, but is sanguine about the chances of outside
support and internal willingness to restore the nation's shattered
economy and morale.
   Bulgaria has fewer friends abroad than other East European
nations, he said, and it alienated the West through Zhivkov's
campaign to assimilate its ethnic Turkish minority.
   ``We have no false hopes that very soon we will be able to
change everything,'' Dertliev said. ``For most people, their own
initiative is dead. ... They wait for somebody to command them.''

<HEAD>Consumers, Funeral Industry Split on Future of `Funeral Rule'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jeanie Karklin says she saved $1,500 on her
mother's funeral because a federal rule required the funeral
director to give her an itemized price list. She calls the rule ``a
godsend.''
   The same rule required funeral director Timothy Simms to hand a
price list to the parents of a 4-year-old boy killed in a car
accident. Simms felt it was ``a tasteless thing to do'' in the
emergency room.
   Six years after it took effect, the so-called ``funeral rule''
is under review by the Federal Trade Commission, and consumers and
the funeral industry are split on whether it should be renewed or
repealed. The review began in May 1988 and FTC staff
recommendations are expected this spring.
   Consumer groups want the rul strengthened, arguing it gives
people important information to help them make one of the biggest
purchases of their lives at a time of stress and bereavement. ``It
costs next to nothing, provides a great deal of consumer
information and may have led to prices going down,'' said Lee
Norrgard of the American Association of Retired Persons, which has
led the fight to retain and expand the rule.
   The nation's largest association of funeral directors,
meanwhile, says the rule unnecessarily regulates day-to-day
business practices, increases costs and hinders funeral directors'
ability to serve grieving customers sensitively.
   ``The rule has placed an undeserved and unwarranted stigma on
the nation's funeral directors as unscrupulous and deceptive
businessmen,'' the National Funeral Directors Association told the
FTC, calling for repeal.
   The rule took effect in 1984 after more than a decade of debate
and investigation into funeral practices, and after the NFDA sued
unsuccessfully to block it. But after living with it for more than
five years, some funeral directors and smaller trade groups are
amenable to retaining it.
   ``Our membership's living with it very well,'' said Connie Ryan,
president of the Wisconsin Funeral Directors Association and
director of Ryan Funeral Home in Madison. ``We haven't had any
difficulties.''
   The rule requires funeral directors to give customers an
itemized price list at the start of discussions, an itemized final
statement of costs, and to give price information over the phone if
asked. It also lets consumers purchase only what they want rather
than packages that may include unnecessary extras, and prohibits
funeral directors from misrepresenting state requirements for
caskets for cremation or the embalming of corpses.
   Americans each year arrange more than 2 million funerals. With
costs averaging $3,000 before burial fees, a funeral may be the
third most expensive consumer purchase after a home and a car,
according to the FTC.
   Mrs. Karklin, of Houston, said the price list she got as she
arranged her mother's funeral in Granby, Mo., in 1986 helped her
insist on reasonably priced items when the funeral director kept
saying her ``dear departed loved one'' deserved more.
   ``Even though I knew beforehand what my rights were, and I knew
my mother had always been a strong and thrifty woman who never
approved of excess of expense, I felt more and more battered down
by what he was saying. I said to him, `Thank God for your price
list.' He didn't look very happy.''
   When people are aware of their rights under the rule, they are
able to be more selective in their funeral purchases, even if they
decide to spend as much money as they would otherwise, said
Clifford Brownstein, executive director of the Continental
Association of Funeral and Memorial Societies.
   The association, which represents 150 memorial societies
nationwide that help people get information and make plans, is
calling for better enforcement of the rule and its expansion to
businesses such as cemeteries and crematories.
   ``For people who are aware of it, it has made them more
knowledgeable consumers,'' Brownstein said. ``But most people have
never heard of it. If you don't know it's there, how can you take
advantage of it?''
   A 1988 study by the FTC's Bureau of Economics found that while
most people got a price list at some point, only about a third of
funeral directors gave a price list and final cost statement in the
required timely manner and did not make misrepresentations. It
found that average funeral spending rose 9 percent between 1981 and
1987, after adjusting for inflation, and concluded that while the
rule did not necessarily cause the increase, the data ``strongly
suggests that the rule did not contribute to a reduction in funeral
expenditures.''
   AARP's Norrgard questioned the FTC's analysis and said there is
evidence prices may have gone down after adjusting for inflation.
In addition, he said, studies show that consumers who get price
lists early tend to spend less, even though they may not compare
prices between funeral homes.
   Mary Ponder, of the National Consumers League, said the benefits
have been limited because ``there is little to no enforcement'' by
the FTC.
   Robert Hardin, executive director of the NFDA, said the price
disclosure requirements have hindered funeral directors, done
nothing to benefit consumers and contribute to higher prices by
adding paperwork and training demands.
   The FTC's own study disproved its theory that consumers would
spend less and shop around more with the rule, he said, adding that
most people select a funeral home because they had a personal
experience with the home or because of its reputation, not based on
price.
   ``The whole concept of the FTC back in 1984 was to try to change
the social mores of this country and to try to convince the
consumer that they're shopping for a car when they're shopping for
a funeral,'' Hardin said. ``It's not a consumer product. It's a
very professional consumer service.''
   Simms, who owns the Wilbur Christensen Funeral Home in Rockford,
Ill., said compliance with the rule has kept him from handling
difficult cases, such as the 1985 death of the 4-year-old boy, as
sensitively as he would like.
   ``To immediately hand someone a price list really becomes very
awkward. The funeral rule lacks the discretion of a judgment call
by a professional.''
   AARP is pushing to extend the rule to cemeteries and to expand
regulation of the booming ``pre-need'' business, in which people
buy in advance to finance funeral or cemetery goods and services.
Some pre-paid contracts, often sold by telephone, direct mail and
door-to-door, aren't covered by the funeral rule.
   Minimum standards would ensure that consumers know what
contracts cover, how the death benefits increase over time, how
secure the investments are and whether contracts can be canceled or
transferred if people move, Norrgard said.
   At an FTC hearing last year, William Jones, of Lucerne, Calif.,
testified that pre-paid plans should be better regulated to keep
unscrupulous businesses from preying on the elderly. Jones said his
87-year-old mother was despondent and in early stages of senility
when a salesman visited her home in Winnemucca, Nev., and persuaded
her to pay $3,105 over two years for a pre-paid funeral.
   The FTC has shown little inclination to get involved in
additional regulation of pre-need contracts, but Norrgard expressed
hope these sales might be the subject of a separate rule-making
procedure later.
   The FTC originally faced a November 1989 deadline for a decision
on its review of the funeral rule but rescinded that because of the
thousands of pages of comments, reports, exhibits and
recommendations that have been submitted.

<HEAD>Requirements Under the Funeral Rule</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-PRI--Funeral Rule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are major requirements of the rule
enacted in 1984 by the Federal Trade Commission help consumers
obtain information about funeral arrangements.
   _TELEPHONE DISCLOSURES: When consumers call to ask about terms,
conditions or prices, the funeral home must state that price
information is available over the telephone and reasonably answer
questions.
   _GENERAL PRICE LIST: If consumers ask in person about
arrangements, the home must provide a general price list that
people can keep and that contains the cost of each funeral item and
service offered.
   _EMBALMING INFORMATION: Homes must give consumers information
about embalming to help them decide whether to buy the service and
must disclose in writing that, except in certain cases, embalming
is not required by law.
   _CASH ADVANCE SALES: Funeral homes must disclose in writing if
they charge a service fee for buying cash advance items on the
consumer's behalf, such as flowers, obituary notices, pallbearers
and clergy honoraria.
   _CASKETS FOR CREMATION: Funeral directors who offer direct
cremation without a ceremony may not state that a casket is
required and must disclose in writing that consumers have a right
to buy an unfinished wood box or an alternative container for
direct cremation.
   _REQUIRED PURCHASE: Consumers do not have to buy unwanted goods
or services as a condition to obtain those they do want, unless
required to do so by state law.
   _ITEMIZED STATEMENT: Funeral directors must give consumers an
itemized statement listing the costs of goods and services selected.
   _PRESERVATIVE CLAIMS: Funeral directors may not tell consumers a
particular funeral item or service can indefinitely preserve a body
in the grave. They also may not state that certain items, such as
caskets or vaults, will keep out water, dirt or other gravesite
substances when that is not true.

<HEAD>Even Amateurs Can Grow Good Cactuses</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>

   James Walters worked for the AP as a reporter
and editor from 1947 until he retired in 1984.

   Kent Newland, a cactus expert, grows them mainly
to enjoy the spectacular flowers, and says he's sure that amateurs
_ even city apartment-dwellers _ can do the same by following a few
simple basics.
   ``They are glorious things to see blooming, just gorgeous. The
flowers may not live for more than a day or two, but while they
last there's nothing quite like it,'' Newland says. ``And if you
have enough of them, they bloom so often you can have some in
flower every day of the year.''
   He has no quarrel with folks who grow cactuses only for their
unique shapes, but says many don't realize flowers are possible
within a year or so even on the small, inexpensive ones sold at
botanical gardens and nurseries.
   Newland, who ``can't remember when I haven't been in love with''
cactuses, spent 14 years with the Boyce Thompson Southwestern
Arboretum in Superior, and now is water resources specialist for
Phoenix's Xeriscape programs.
   For home growers, he says, success with cactus begins with
selecting the proper types: ``Globular kinds as opposed, say, to
columnar ones like saguaros or cereus, or types like the prickly
pears,'' which need a lot of light.
   ``Better choices are mammillarias, pincushions and similar
types. They need good light but not high amounts, so they'll adapt,
grow and flower in a south-facing window while the large ones at
best will exist.''
   Indoors, most people will be happiest with cactus that flourish
in no larger than a 6- to 8-inch pot, such as ``hard-bodied''
mammillarias like the old-lady cactus (Mammillaria hahniana) or the
mother of hundreds (M. cupressa).
   ``After plant selection, the trick to growing cactuses is good
drainage ... I think more cactus are lost from underwatering than
overwatering. To encourage root systems, you need to keep them
fairly damp _ not soaking wet, of course.
   ``Plants don't look very healthy if they haven't been watered
for six months, because the root systems die,'' Newland says.
   So how do you know when to water? ``I'd put a finger on the soil
and if it feels moist, it's probably all right. Water when it feels
bone dry. When a plant is starting to grow, throwing out new spines
or stems, that's the time to encourage it with water and fertilizer
to initiate flowers.''
   During such growing periods, Newland includes an all-purpose
fertilizer every other watering, applying about an eighth to a
fourth of the recommended dosage, to ensure ``good, even amounts of
growth for flower production.'' While he doesn't use slow-release
fertilizers, they would be fine in moderation.
   ``Growing medium is extremely important,'' he says. ``The big
thing is to stay away from pure-organic potting soils, even if the
bag is labeled `cactus mix.' They're very hard to wet up and very
hard to dry out. However, if you amend that potting soil with some
sharp masonry sand and some perlite, the plant should grow well.
   ``But first make sure the water drains through the mixture. I'd
fill a test pot to an inch or so of the top with the mix _ without
a plant; tamp the mix as usual and fill it with water. If you don't
get water coming out of the drain hole within one or two minutes, a
cactus will slowly dry up and die in it. So add more sand and try
the new batch until it drains right.''
   A good starting point is about half organic matter, 40 percent
sand and 10 percent perlite, blended well.
   Newland repots each new cactus, discarding the former growing
medium. ``That way I know the soil mix is identical for all my
cactuses and if there are some hidden insects I get rid of them.''
Before transplanting, he also loosens the root ball to encourage
the root system to expand.
   ``Pot size also is important. You don't want to put a 2-inch
cactus in a 6-inch pot. Put it in a 3-inch, or maybe a 4-inch,
moving it along as it grows.''
   Mealybugs have been known to ruin cactus collections almost
overnight. Newland will use malathion or diazinon soil drench if
necessary, but believes the best way to avoid pests is to grow
healthy plants. ``Like a human being, if you're healthy you're less
prone to disease.''

<HEAD>Study May Explain Why Early Alzheimer's Patients Bump Into Things</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's
disease suffer damage to a specific type of eye cell, explaining
why they often bump into things and have trouble reading despite
20-20 vision, researchers say.
   The incurable, progressive brain disorder, which causes
premature dementia or senility, doesn't substantially affect optic
cells, called P cells, that are responsible for visual acuity. But
it causes degeneration of M cells essential for people to orient
themselves in space, according to the study published in the
January issue of the journal Ophthalmology.
   Just as charts of letters test visual acuity produced by P
cells, Dr. Alfredo Sadun said his team at the University of
Southern California developed a test to check the performance of M
cells. Sadun said it might be used to help diagnose early stages of
Alzheimer's disease, which is estimated to afflict 8 percent of the
U.S. population over age 65.
   Optic nerves from 10 deceased Alzheimer's patients and the
cadavers of 10 people without the disease were examined by Sadun,
an associate professor of ophthalmology and neurological surgery.
   Retinal tissue from three Alzheimer's patients and two normal
cadavers also were examined, and 15 Alzheimer's patients with no
known eye disease were given complete exams of the eyes and related
parts of the nervous system.
   The postmortems found optic nerve degeneration in eight of the
10 Alzheimer's patients and none of the control cadavers. The
degeneration was mainly of M cells and related fibers.
   The loss of M cells is consistent with the symptoms Sadun found
among living Alzheimer's patients: difficulty in reading and
spatial orientation despite an ability to see very small objects
and colors, and difficulty in detecting movements of objects and
differences in shades.

<HEAD>Retirees, Baby Boomers Can Work Together on Health Care</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baby Boomers should help solve problems in
health care before they reach retirement, AARP President Louise D.
Crooks says.
   ``The Baby Boomers are seeing what is happening to their parents
_ lack of adequate retirement incomes and the high cost of health
care _ and don't want the same things to happen to them,'' Crooks
said at the American Association of Retired Persons' National
Leadership Orientation Conference this month.
   Retired people and Baby Boomers _ people born in roughly 1946 to
1964 _ are beginning to work together toward achieving a better
quality of life, she said. ``This aging of America creates
challenges and opportunities we must consider now, not 20 or 30
years from now.''
   The population explosion of the Baby Boom produced a third of
all living Americans, or about 76 million people, she said. The
first of this generation will reach age 50 in 1996 and begin
retiring from 2000 to 2010.
   Quoting Census Bureau statistics, Crooks said there are now 64
million people in the United States 50 or older. That group will
increase to 76 million by the end of the century and to 113 million
by 2025. The National Institute of Aging predicts that by 2040 life
expectancy will be 86 for men and more than 91 for women, she said.
``Will we be able to provide the health care this growing number of
older Americans will need?''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whittle Communications, which has been
considering making commercially-sponsored television programs for
doctor's waiting rooms, said it has acquired a company that was
about to launch such a service.
   The Knoxville, Tenn.-based media company said Sunday it had
acquired Healthcare Television Network Inc., a privately-held
company based in Tampa, Fla. Healthcare had signed up about 3,500
pediatrician's offices and a dozen advertisers for a television
service. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   The acquisition increases chances that Whittle will move ahead
quickly in developing a closed-circuit TV system of its own, giving
advertisers another way to reach a captive audience.
   Whittle already has magazines and sponsored posters in about
60,000 health care offices, and disclosed in November it was
considering developing TV programs for waiting rooms.
   ``We see the purchase of HTN as a real opportunity to quickly
expand our waiting-room television project,'' said Alan Greenberg,
Whittle vice chairman.
   Phil Cohen, the 41-year-old chief executive and founder of
Healthcare Television, said in a telephone interview he has been
developing the service for about 2{ years and was within a few
weeks of launching it.
   He said his company had ordered 3,500 television sets and
videocassette recorders that were to be distributed to
participating waiting rooms. He said the first one-hour program,
which included several short segments on topics ranging from sleep
disturbance to child care safety, was ready.
   The plan is to have the tapes played continuously in waiting
rooms on television sets handsomely displayed in custom-made
cabinets.
   The programming would be changed every three months. Advertisers
including consumer products giants such as Procter &amp; Gamble,
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Mattell Inc. had signed up, Cohen said.
   ``We were terribly impressed with what they had accomplished to
date,'' Greenberg said in a separate telephone interview. He noted
that Whittle does not buy other companies often, preferring instead
to develop its own media properties.
   Greenberg said he is studying how to incorporate Healthcare
Television into Whittle's operations. One possibility is to operate
Healthcare Television as a separate subsidiary. Whittle also could
accelerate plans for its own system and merge it with Healthcare.
   One difference between the two systems is that Whittle was
planning to distribute its programs by satellite. Whittle also had
planned to change the programming more frequently, possibly every
week.
   Whittle also was undecided whether its programs would be
health-oriented or pure entertainment, while Healthcare's shows
were to be health-based.
   In any case, Whittle said the service it dubbed Waiting Room TV
potentially could wind up in 100,000 doctor's waiting rooms
nationwide.
   Whittle's only other TV project to date is the Channel One news
service for use in the classroom, scheduled for launch in March in
1,000 schools across the country. Channel One has been barred from
public schools in New York and California and has attracted heated
opposition from some education groupos because each 12-minute daily
news show would include commercials.
   Cohen, who declined to discuss how much he was paid for
Healthcare Television or his future plans, said Whittle has the
experience and manpower to expand his company's service more
rapidly.
   ``I know they can take what we started and just multiply it
exponentially,'' he said.
   Cohen said he had several partners in the company, including
Grey Advertising, a New York-based ad agency that had invested in
the company last spring. Whittle acquired complete control of the
company in the deal.

<HEAD>AM General Selling 20,000 Hummers to South Korea

<DATELINE>MISHAWAKA, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A division of LTV Corp. has announced a
joint venture to sell as many as 20,000 all-terrain trucks to South
Korea's armed forces.
   Officials of the AM General Division and Kia Motors Corp. signed
a memorandum of understanding Friday giving the Korean company the
go-ahead to seek a contract from its government for the vehicle,
named the Hummer.
   AM General officials said the Hummer's performance under fire in
Panama recently has bolstered its international reputation. The
company will continue to seek more foreign customers, spokesman
Craig C. Mac Nab added.
   Han Sun Kim, president of Kia's Asia Motors Co. Inc. subsidiary,
said South Korean armed forces would like to buy as many as 20,000
Hummers over as long as 12 years.
   The military is eager to buy Hummers because the vehicle is used
widely in South Korea by the U.S. 8th Army and has enjoyed a good
reputation with troops from both nations, Kim said.
   AM General President James A. Armour said a Korean deal would
bring more jobs to the company's plant in Mishawaka, about 80 miles
east of Chicago, and add $15 to $20 million to annual revenues. The
plant employs about 1,000 workers currently.
   Kia is Korea's second-largest automotive manufacturer behind
Hyundai. It manufactures the Festiva, a subcompact marketed by Ford
in the United States.
   Under Korean law, any Hummers used by Korean forces would have
to be assembled in that country. AM General workers would assemble
kits that would be shipped to Korea for final assembly.
   Over the past 12 years, Asia Motors has assembled about 27,000
heavy-duty military trucks from kits provided by AM General. Armour
said AM General's sales to Asia Motors have totaled about $230
million over that period.

   Stock prices declined at midday Monday, after
early morning price hikes by market makers attracted little

   At about noon local time, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange

   Midday volume totaled 171.2 million, down from 240.3 million
Friday.
   Dealers said genuine buying interest likely wouldn't re-emerge
until concerns over domestic and foreign economies subsided.
   They said any potential advance was hampered by a warning from
home products retailer Coloroll Group PLC that it expects a further
erosion in profit.
   The Coloroll news ``was another nail in the coffin as far as
sentiment goes,'' said a director at a British brokerage firm.

   China's chief economic planner said Monday that his
country has achieved social and economic stability in the past few
months to ensure progress in its economic reforms.
   But Zou Jiahua, head of China's State Planning Commission,
acknowledged that China faces considerable economic headaches.
   ``The population of China is large, and the issues the Chinese
people face are serious and tough. We need a stable and united
government, and a stable environment, to carry through construction
of socialism,'' Zou said in a speech to the Japan Association for
the Promotion of International Trade, the sponsor of his visit.
   ``Since the turmoil of last year, we have been effective in
stabilizing our country's society, government and economy,'' he
said.
   Zou, who arrived in Japan last week, is the first high-level
Chinese official to visit since the bloody crackdown on political
dissent last June.
   Japan banned high-level contacts with China until earlier this
month to protest the violence in Beijing, which left hundreds of
unarmed protesters dead.
   Zou, a member of the State Council, or Cabinet, said China's
lifting of martial law in Beijing Jan. 11 was evidence of stability.
   The move was widely seen overseas as a gesture aimed at bringing
foreign investors back to China and inducing Western governments to
drop sanctions imposed after the June crackdown.
   Zou has met with several leading politicians, including former
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who pledged a package of $5.6
billion in loans on a visit to China in 1988.
   Japanese news reports said Takeshita accepted an invitation from
Zou to visit China soon.
   Japan froze discussions on the loans after last June's
bloodshed. It urged China to ease its hard-line stance toward
dissent, and after martial law was lifted a team of Japanese
officials went to China to reopen negotiations on the loans.
   China's economy has been plagued in recent years by
overproduction of some items, scarcities of many resources,
widespread construction of unnecessary or unaffordable buildings
and facilities, and soaring inflation.
   ``We have a few economic problems at the moment, but they are
problems that go along with progress, and we will overcome them,''
Zou said. ``If you look at the overheated tempo of industrial
growth over a few years, it has come down to a more reasonable
level.''
   Nationwide industrial production was up 6.8 percent last year,
and agricultural output was up 4 percent, he said.

<HEAD>Longtime Jobless Turning to Unlisted Numbers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEIDEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unlisted telephone numbers are
becoming increasingly popular among the longtime unemployed as part
of a trend to create barriers for all-too-prying government eyes, a
recent study shows.
   In unemployment-prone districts in the Netherlands' biggest
cities, up to 45 percent of those out of a job for more than two
years have an unlisted number, according to Godfried Engbersen, a
researcher at the Sociology Faculty of Leiden State University.
   The national unlisted average in this country of 14.6 million is
10 percent of 6.5 million telephones, according to Fred Lemmerink,
a spokesman for PTT Telecom, the national phone company.
   ``Opting for an unlisted number is an act of defiance, of
escaping from the ubiquitous eye of the government,'' Engbersen
said in a Monday interview.
   ``People got the feeling that when they are on the dole for a
long period of time, their lives are being intolerably intruded by
the social security services.''
   Engbersen's study covered 270 people who had been jobless for up
to 10 years in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Enschede, a city in the
eastern Netherlands. Nationwide, this category accounts for about
25 percent of the nation's 700,000 unemployed.

<TEXT>
   The government today filed preliminary
charges against a Swedish arms manufacturer, accusing the company
of paying $50 million in kickbacks to seal a 1986 arms deal.
   Investigators said former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
would be among those questioned.
   Gandhi has said repeatedly that he did not gain personally from
the deal and that no Indians received kickbacks or commissions in
the contract with the company, A.B. Bofors.
   Bofors spokesman Johnny Ericsson said in Stockholm, Sweden, that
the company would have no comment.
   Rajendra Shekhar, director of the Central Bureau of
Investigation, told reporters the preliminary charges would form
the ``launching pad'' for an investigation.
   The charges identify three people as ``the accused'' in the
case: Gopichand Hinduja, a London-based Indian industrialist;
Martin Ardbo, who was president of Bofors when the deal was signed;
and Win Chadha, the Bofors agent in New Delhi.
   Shekhar said several others, including top Indian officials,
also were involved but he refused to identify them.
   The legal action was the first step by new Prime Minister V.P.
Singh toward fulfilling his election campaign promise to root out
corruption, which he said flourished under Gandhi.
   Gandhi's government signed the 1986 contract with Bofors and
agreed to pay $1.4 billion for 410 155mm howitzers. But the
following year charges surfaced in Swedish and Indian news media of
kickbacks in the deal.
   Shekhar said at least $50 million was paid through Swiss banks
to clinch the sale.
   Newspaper reports have claimed that much of the money was paid
to intermediaries, including people close to Gandhi and in the
ruling circles of his Congress Party.
   The corruption charges dogged Gandhi through the rest of his
tenure, giving Singh a powerful weapon in last November's national
election.
   Although Gandhi outpolled Singh in the balloting, he could not
muster a majority of seats in Parliament, and Singh formed a
minority government with support from other parties.
   The preliminary charges, filed before a district judge in New
Delhi, listed these alleged offenses: criminal conspiracy, cheating
and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, forgery, forgery for
the purpose of cheating, criminal breach of trust and abuse of
official position by public servants.
   The charges carry penalties that include unspecified fines and
prison terms.

<HEAD>Oregon Farm Couple Loses Challenge to Bank's Foreclosure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Oregon couple seeking to hold onto a farm
in their family since 1853 today lost a Supreme Court challenge to
a bank's foreclosure.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the federal
law Myron and Jane Harper relied on in their legal fight gives only
the government, not farmers, the right to sue.
   A federal appeals court ruling in the Harpers' case set binding
law in nine western states, and involves an farm-loan program
totaling over $50 billion nationwide.
   The Harpers raise hogs, corn and small grains on their farm in
Oregon's Willamette Valley.
   In 1984, the Harpers were unable to make all their loan payments
on the farm. The Federal Land Bank of Spokane, now the Farm Credit
Bank of Spokane, moved to foreclose on the farm in January 1987 and
a foreclosure sale was scheduled for Nov. 17 of that year.
   The Harpers staved off the sale by seeking bankruptcy law
protection on Nov. 13. But their bankruptcy petition was dismissed
in February 1988, and a sheriff's sale of the farm was held March
18, 1988.
   In the interim, the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 had been
signed into law by then-President Ronald Reagan.
   The act, a major rehauling of the federally created Farm Credit
Service, requires lenders of distressed loans to let borrowers
know, before any foreclosure can take place, that their loans may
be suitable for restructuring.
   Farm Credit System lenders extend about 30 percent of all farms
loans nationwide. That percentage totals over $50 billion.
   The Harpers sued in federal court in April 1988, seeking to
postpone final conveyance of their farmland to those who bought it
at the foreclosure sale.
   U.S. District Judge Owen Panner barred the Harpers' eviction
from their farm, ruling that the Federal Land Bank of Spokane ``had
a duty (under the 1987 law) to weigh the costs of foreclosure
against the costs of restructuring.''
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the judge's
injunction last June 24, ruling that the 1987 law does not give
individual farmers the right to sue lenders who allegedly violate
it.
   In writing the law, Congress did not say explicitly whether such
lawsuits were permissible, and the appeals court said, ``We hold
there is no implied private right of action.''
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Harpers said the
San Francisco-based 9th Circuit court's ruling is at odds with a
ruling last Oct. 5 by the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   But lawyers for the Federal Land Bank of Spokane noted that the
8th Circuit panel's decision has been set aside pending review by
that entire appeals court.
   The case is Harper vs. Federal Land Bank of Spokane, 89-863.

<TEXT>
   Monsanto Co. said Monday that earnings doubled
in the fourth-quarter and rose 15 percent for the year, despite
volatile raw materials prices, weather-related problems and
softness in the U.S. automotive market, a big customer of the
chemical giant.
   Earnings for the fourth quarter of 1989 totaled $90 million, or
$1.37 per share, on sales of $2.01 billion, up from earnings of $45
million, or 70 cents per share, on sales of $1.88 billion in the
same period a year ago.
   The company reported earnings for 1989 of $679 million or $10.03
a share, vs. $591 million or $8.68 a share earned in 1988. Sales
for the year were $8.68 billion, up 5 percent from the $8.29
billion reported in 1988.
   ``We expected 1989 to be another strong year for Monsanto and we
certainly weren't disappointed,'' said Richard J. Mahoney, chairman
and chief executive officer.
   He said strong demand for Monsanto products around the world,
especially in Europe, help offset problems with raw material prices
early in the year and the other unfavorable factors.
   Mahoney said Monsanto Chemical Co. and the NutraSweet Co. had
record years and G. D. Searle recorded its first profitable year
since the unit was acquired by Monsanto in 1985.
   He said Monsanto Agricultural Co.'s Crop Chemicals unit recorded
another solid year while its Animal Sciences Division experienced
narrowed profit margins because of increased competition.
   Mahoney said Fisher Controls more than doubled annual earnings.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed this
morning on the Chicago Board of Trade after an opening decline
stalled, forcing early sellers to cover risky positions by buying.
   The turnaround occurred after the March soybean contract reached
a life-of-contract low of $5.63 a bushel, an event which often
brings more sellers into the market.
   Fundamental factors remained bearish, with beneficial rains
reported over the weekend in the U.S. winter wheat belt and in the
key soybean-producing region of southern Brazil. More rain is
expected in both regions this week.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.92 a bushel; corn was
1 cent to 2{ cents lower with March at $2.40{ a bushel; oats were 1

<DATELINE>FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Central Soya Co. is taking advantage of
recent political reforms in Eastern Europe to pursue projects in
Yugoslavia and the Soviet republic of Estonia, a spokesman said
Monday.
   Central Soya also formed a joint venture earlier this month with
a Hungarian feed manufacturer in a deal that evolved from a
technical services contract signed 20 years ago.
   The Fort Wayne-based agribusiness company will be a minority
partner in Agrkomplex-Central Soya Feed Producer and Distributor
Corp. Agard, Hungary's state-owned agribusiness, will be the
majority partner and several other Hungarian companies also will be
partners in the venture to produce feed for poultry and livestock.
   ``In this particular venture, (political reforms) would have had
a fairly minimal impact. However, some of the other projects in
Eastern Europe, these developments should be accelerated,'' said
Central Soya spokesman Barry G. Collingsworth.
   Last spring the company formed a venture with the Polish
cooperative Osnowo to manufacture animal feed concentrates and
market livestock. The venture is called Central Soya-Rolpol, Ltd.,
Collingsworth said.
   Still in development are a possible technical service contract
in Estonia and a soy protein venture in Yugoslavia.
   ``We're committed to Eastern Europe as a primary growth area,''
said David H. Swanson, Central Soya's president and chief executive
officer, ``and we believe that our long-standing business
relationships form the basis for that growth.
   ``We've sown the seeds by offering expert technology and quality
products, and that dedication continues to be mutually
beneficial,'' Swanson said.
   Central Soya, a subsidiary of the Italy's Ferruzzi
Agro-Industrial Group, has sold feed technology, mixes and
concentrates since 1969 to Agrokomplex, the company said. Swanson
and other executives traveled to Hungary earlier this month for a
celebration marking the 20th anniversary of that deal.
   ``Agrokomplex holds the second largest single share of the aimal
feed market in Hungary,'' Swanson said. ``The manufacturing
capabilities and market presence of the Hungarian entity, coupled
with the technology of Central Soya, should lay a foundation for
the growth and propserity of this new firm.''
   Jeno Vancsa, former Hungarian minister of agriculture and food,
is chairman of the new venture located near the town of Agard. It
will employ about 450 people in producing and marketing premixes,
complete feeds and milk replacers to more than 400 ``partners,'' or
business associates, throughout Hungary, Soya said.
   Soya markets products to customers in more than 60 countries.
Its major businesses include feed manufacturing, soybean
processing, grain merchandising, vegetable oil refining and the
manufacture of soy proteins and lecithins. It operates more than 65
plants and facilities worldwide.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. and Austrian
automaker Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG said today they would establish a
joint venture for producing Chrysler's popular minivans in Austria.
   The agreement in principle between Chrysler and the Austrian
engineering and automotive company provides for establishment of
joint production of the Chrysler Voyager in Graz, Austria's
second-largest city, for the European market.
   Under the joint venture, Chrysler and Steyr-Daimler-Puch
Fahrzeugtechnick GMBH will develop Voyager spare parts specifically
designed for the European market, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca
told a news conference in Vienna.
   Iacocca said production was scheduled to begin in Spring 1991.
   Chrysler already has been involved in other joint ventures in
Europe, including a venture to build Jeeps in conjunction with
French automaker Renault.
   U.S. automakers increasingly have expanded in the European
market as their North American sales have sagged under the weight
of a slowing U.S. economy and stepped-up competition from foreign
``transplants'' _ foreign-owned car factories located in the United
States.
   The Voyager has been one of Chrysler's best sellers in the
United States since its introduction in 1983, with Chrysler
commanding nearly half of the U.S. market for minivans.

<HEAD>Court To Resolve Procedural Dispute Over Disability Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to resolve
a procedural dispute over denied Social Security disability
benefits.
   The court said it will review the case of a New Jersey widow
whose 1983 application for disability benefits was denied by the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   But the court's decision, expected by July, will not determine
whether Marilyn Finkelstein, 59, is entitled to the benefits.
   Instead, the justices will decide whether a federal trial
judge's order that HHS officials reconsider her application may be
appealed by HHS to a federal appeals court before any such
reconsideration.
   Mrs. Finkelstein sued, and a federal judge in Newark ruled that
HHS had used the wrong standard in determining her eligibility for
disability benefits.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the government's
ensuing appeal, saying the trial judge's order was not a ``final
decision'' that could be appealed immediately.
   The government then filed the appeal acted on today.
   The case is Sullivan vs. Finkelstein, 89-504.

   The dollar rose Monday in trading in Europe,
boosted by worries over unrest in the Soviet Union.
   Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said worries over the political
implications of fighting in Soviet Azerbaijan along with the belief
that the Federal Reserve Board was unlikely to ease its monetary
policy fortified the dollar.
   But concern about possible central bank intervention to drive
the currency lower or at lerast curb its rise was restraining the
dollar, dealers said.
   ``Sentiment is for a higher dollar, but there's not much to back
it up today,'' said one corporate dealer at a U.S. bank in London.
   The lack of news prompted some light short-covering, or the
buying of dollars to fulfill agreements to sell them, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.09 yen to a closing 146.42 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 146.45 yen.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6385 from $1.6475 late
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.7230 West German marks, up from 1.7050; 1.5325
Swiss francs, up from 1.5140; 5.8550 French francs, up from 5.6955;

   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $405.25 a troy ounce from
$410.25 late Friday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of
$405.75 from $408.65 bid late Friday.
   Gold fell $1.50 an ounce to close at a bid $407.85 in Hong Kong.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.20 a troy

   The stock market showed widespread losses today,
resuming its early-1990 slump amid worries about the outlook for
corporate profits and interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 33.08 points to
2,644.82 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 7 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 307 up,
1,157 down and 436 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders remained uneasy about weak corporate
earnings reports for the fourth quarter of last year, as well as
the recent upturn in open-market interest rates.
   The Federal Reserve is seen as facing an increasingly difficult
set of choices in setting monetary policy to stave off a recession
while trying to keep inflation at bay.
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, will be making several
appearances before congressional committees in the near future.
   Wall Streeters will be watching closely to see what positions he
might take on such matters as the risk rising worldwide interest
rates might pose for the business outlook.

<HEAD>Delta Reports `Disappointing' Earnings for Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines Chairman Ronald W. Allen said a
25 percent drop in the company's net income during its second
fiscal quarter resulted from higher fuel prices and lower income
per mile from fares during the period.
   Allen said Saturday that weak ``passenger-mile yields'' for
Thanksgiving and Christmas, usually two of the busiest times for
the airline, also contributed to the decrease.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31 _ the second quarter in
Delta's fiscal year _ Delta's net income was $64.2 million or $1.13
a share. During the same period a year earlier, earnings were $85.2
million or $1.73 a share.
   Operating revenue for the latest quarter was $2.05 billion, up
from $1.86 billion in the same period a year earlier.
   But fuel costs rose from $220.5 million in the second quarter of
1988 to $314.2 million in the latest three-month period.
   Increases in fuel costs recently have been cited for fare hikes
throughout the U.S. airline industry.
   ``Fuel expenses rose 43 percent, the result of a 34 percent jump
in the average price of aircraft fuel,'' Allen said.
   He also noted that the passenger-mile yields _ the money taken
in per passenger for each mile flown _ were down about 1 percent
during the typically busy holiday season. For the recent quarter,
the yield was 13.39 cents, down from 13.48 cents in the year-ago
report.
   For the six months ended Dec. 31, Delta said its net income was
$197.4 million, or $3.65 a share, compared with $185.1 million, or
$3.76 a share, a year earlier.
   Six-month revenue rose 13 percent to $4.22 billion from $3.74
billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Weather, Seasonal Decline Contribute to Decline in Rig Count</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bad weather and a seasonal decline in drilling
activity sent the number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs tumbling
by 55 this week, Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   The rig count totaled 964, compared to 1,019 a week ago. But the
tally was higher than the 789 total posted this time last year.
   Texas and Oklahoma were the big losers this week, accounting for
more than half of the decline. Texas lost 23 rigs, while Oklahoma's
rig count fell by 12.
   Baker Hughes rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Ike Kerridge, a Baker Hughes vice president and economist, said
he expected the decline, and he added it will continue.
   ``This is the time of year when drilling declines,'' Kerridge
said, adding that the rig count usually drops by up to 20 percent
during the first quarter of each year.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   The rig count peaked at 4,500 in December 1981 _ the height of
the oil boom. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per 42-gallon
barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count
that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began compiling
figures.
   Among other major oil producing states, Colorado lost five rigs,
Wyoming lost four and Pennsylvania was down by one. North Dakota,
New Mexico, Michigan and Kansas each lost two rigs. Louisiana
gained one rig.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Home Products Corp. on Monday reported
a 19 percent increase in its fourth-quarter income and 10.8 percent
profit growth for all of last year.
   The diversified food, drugs and consumer products company said
its sales rose 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter and 5.5 percent in
1989.
   Income, after taxes, grew to $304 million, or $1.95 a share, in
the three months ended Dec. 31 from $254.9 million, or $1.65 a
share, a year earlier. Sales totaled $1.64 billion, up from $1.54
billion in 1988's fourth quarter.
   For 1989, American Home Products earned $1.1 billion, or $7.07 a
share, compared to $995 million, or $6.43 a share, in 1988. Last
year's sales amounted to $6.75 billion vs. 1988's $6.40 billion.
   The results for both years were restated to include the
operations of A.H. Robins Co. Inc., which was merged into American
Home Products on Dec. 15.
   Last year's net income included tax benefits derived from the
use of net operating losses generated by Robins on its funding of
the trusts settling lawsuits over the Dalkon Shield birth control
device.
   American Home Products said its 1989 tax provision was reduced
by the amount of taxes which would otherwise have been payable on
Robins' 1989 U.S. income and by $94 million mainly relating to the
refund of prior years' taxes paid by Robins.
   Robins, faced with thousands of lawsuits involving the Dalkon
Shield, had been reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Act since 1985.

<HEAD>Administration View Sought on Arbitration Contracts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Bush
administration for its view on whether stockbrokers may be forced
to give investors the option of suing rather than resolving fraud
disputes in arbitration.
   The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyers
about a ruling that barred Massachusetts from requiring brokers to
make arbitration clauses optional, not mandatory, in brokerage
contracts.
   The justices are not expected to take any action in the
Massachusetts case until hearing from the government lawyers, which
could take months.
   The Massachusetts appeal is supported by 30 other states, whose
officials said a federal appeals court ruling leaves them
``powerless to protect consumers from being coerced to enter
arbitration agreements.''
   The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last
Aug. 31 that the Massachusetts regulations are pre-empted by
federal law.
   The prevailing practice in the brokerage industry is to require
customers to agree to arbitrate all disputes as a condition to
opening an account.
   In other business-related rulings Monday, the court:
   _Agreed to decide whether nuclear industry ``whistleblowers''
who say they were disciplined for complaining about lax safety may
sue under state personal-injury laws. The justices will review a
North Carolina case in which a federal appeals court said such
workers must sue under a special federal law.
   _Ruled against an Oregon couple that challenged a bank's
foreclosure on a farm in their family since 1853. The court let
stand a ruling that the federal law Myron and Jane Harper relied on
in their legal fight gives only the government, not farmers, the
right to sue.
   _Refused to require arbitration for hundreds of thousands of
federal workers when they are fired, demoted or otherwise
disciplined. The court rejected appeals by a labor union and the
Federal Labor Relations Authority seeking broader job protection
for federal employees.
   _Refused to let public employee labor unions get from the
government the home addresses of federal workers, leaving intact a
ruling that the workers' privacy would be violated if government
agencies are forced to divulge the information to the unions.
   _Scuttled a federal lawsuit stemming from the collapse of the
Old Court Savings &amp; Loan Association in Maryland, saying state
courts may handle suits based on a federal anti-racketeering law.
The justices said lower federal courts rightly dismissed the suit
because similar ones were being handled by state courts in Maryland.
   On mandatory arbitration clauses, the justices in 1987 ruled 5-4
that if such clauses are in the contracts signed by investors,
disputes over alleged fraud are to be resolved in arbitration, not
in lawsuits.
   Massachusetts' secretary of state in 1988 imposed regulations
prohibiting brokers from making arbitration agreements
non-negotiable conditions for opening accounts. The regulations
also required brokers to tell customers about the legal effects of
mandatory arbitration clauses.
   The state's action immediately was challenged by the Securities
Industry Association and 10 brokerage firms affiliated with it.
   A federal judge ruled for the brokers, and the appeals court
upheld that ruling.
   ``The long and short of it is that we can find no evidence of a
clear congressional command to override the unambiguous
pro-arbitration mandate of the (Federal Arbitration Act) in the
securities field,'' the appeals court said.
   In the state's appeal, Massachusetts Attorney General James M.
Shannon said the August ruling ``has national implications for
state regulation of mandatory arbitration agreements in banking,
health care, (the) automobile and many other industries.''
   Shannon said the Federal Arbitration Act does not pre-empt all
state regulation of arbitration.
   Lawyers for the securities industry urged the justices to reject
the state's appeal.

<HEAD>Cranston Says He'll Help Burned Lincoln Bondholders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Alan Cranston said Monday he would
introduce legislation to allow investors to sue the government if
they fail in other efforts to recover losses from worthless junk
bonds sold at Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association.
   The California Democrat, facing his most serious political
crisis because of his involvement with Lincoln, continued an attack
that began last week, blaming a former banking regulator for
investors' losses.
   Cranston said his legislation, to be introduced this week, would
allow bond holders to file suit against the U.S. government if they
are unsuccessful in suits against Lincoln, parent American
Continental Corp., and company chief Charles H. Keating Jr.
   The government is usually immune from such suits, but Cranston
said there were precedents allowing lawsuits in cases of government
negligence.
   ``Documents I have received from the Office of Thrift
Supervision in Washington and the General Accounting Office are
clearly enough evidence on which to bring a case of negligence
against the government,'' Cranston said.
   Cranston spoke at the latest in a series of news conferences
intended to deflect blame that had been aimed at him for investor
losses stemming from the failure of the Irvine-based Lincoln.
   Cranston, the Senate majority whip, is one five senators under
investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee for intervening with
regulators on behalf of Lincoln, American Continental of Phoenix
and Keating. Keating and his family contributed $1.3 million to the
senators and their causes.
   Three recent polls show Cranston's popularity with California
voters has plunged to its lowest level since he came to the Senate
in 1969, but he has promised to seek re-election next year
nonetheless.
   By focusing on the bondholders, he hopes to disarm one of the
most personally damaging allegations against him _ bondholders'
testimony that his intervention for Keating made him partly
responsible for their losses.
   He spent much of last week attacking former chief S&amp;L regulator
Edwin J. Gray as the main culprit in the failure of Lincoln and the
losses to bondholders, many of them elderly people who lost their
life savings.
   Cranston tried to paint what he called ``a picture of negligence
by Gray and his staff'' when Gray headed the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board.
   As ammunition, Cranston released a chronology by federal
regulators that showed the bank board permitted American
Continental to sell its junk bonds at the thrift's offices even
though regulators questioned the firm's ability to repay
bondholders.
   The bonds, unlike bank accounts at Lincoln, were not insured and
became worthless when American Continental filed for bankruptcy.
Cranston said investors were victims of bait-and-switch tactics
that regulators should not have allowed.
   State and federal officials say the bondholders, mostly Los
Angeles-area retirees, were targeted by Lincoln to switch nearly
$200 million of federally insured deposits into the uninsured junk
bonds after federal examiners first recommended closing the
Irvine-based thrift in May 1987.
   The $2 billion-plus cost for protecting depositors with insured
accounts _ not the bondholders _ is likely to be the most expensive
thrift takeover in history.

<TEXT>
   United Technologies Corp. on Monday
credited a strong performance by its jet engine and aeronautics
divisions for a modest increase in fourth-quarter earnings despite
flat revenues.
   The defense giant posted net income of $184.4 million, or $1.36
a share, on revenues of $5.3 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31,
compared to net income of $150.6 million, or $1.16 a share, on
revenues of $5.3 billion for the same period a year ago.
   Operating income for the power and flight segments was $249
million vs. $194 million for the same period a year ago, with most
of the increase generated by Pratt &amp; Whitney's commercial jet
engine business, the company said.
   The flight systems operating income was $72 million for the
quarter, vs. $39 million for the period a year ago, with Hamilton
Standard aeronautics division accounting for most of the
improvement.
   Operating income for the building segments, including Carrier
air conditioners and Otis elevators, dropped to $73 million from
$85 million a year ago, primarily because of lower profits at
Carrier, which had benefitted from a one-time gain in the
fourth-quarter of 1988.
   For the year, UTC posted net income of $702.1 million, or $5.20
a share on a fully diluted basis, on revenues of $19.8 billion, vs.
net income of $659.1 million, or $5.05 a share, on revenues of
$18.5 billion in 1988.
   For the year, Pratt &amp; Whitney had $11 billion in commercial
engine orders, including options, vs. $5 billion in 1988.
   Revenues from overseas operations and exports increased 18
percent to $9.8 billion and now account for 50 percent of total
revenues, said Robert F. Daniell, UTC chairman and chief executive
officer.

$198 million in revenues during fiscal year 1989, or about 24
percent of the company's total revenue of $837 million.
   Geoff Hibner, vice president of finance for Universal Foods,
said the company wanted to focus its attention on developing other
parts of its operations.
   ``The cheese business is tough right now,'' Hibner said. ``The
price of milk has skyrocketed and cheese prices just aren't keeping
up.''
   Hibner said the money from the division's sale will be used for
development of the company's frozen food division, which he said is
growing fastest, and development of its flavor and color division.
   ``We made a number of acquisitions last year in the flavor and
color business and we anticipate more,'' Hibner said. ``That's
really our business _ we want to be in the food ingredient supply
business.''
   Lee Brinkerhoff and Harry Smith, vice presidents and general
managers of the cheese division, have been planning the buyout
attempt since the holidays, Brinkerhoff said.
   ``We already have the initial equity needed for the transaction,
but we think we'll need the help of other employees to make the
transaction work,'' he said.
   Brinkerhoff said he and Smith have had talks with several
investors but have not yet identified any definite outside sources
of capital. He said no immediate changes in the division's
operations are planned.
   ``For the time being, we plan business as usual,'' he said.
   Hibner said he does not anticipate Universal Foods will sell any
other divisions.
   Guy A. Osborn, president and chief executive officer, said in a
prepared statement he anticipates Universal Foods will reach its
earnings target of $1.93 per share this year.
   Universal Foods last year successfully fended off a hostile
takeover by Massachusetts-based Amanda Acquisition Corp., which had
offered more than $700 million for the company.
   The takeover was abandoned after courts refused to overturn
Universal Foods' poison-pill defense or Wisconsin's anti-takeover
law, both of which blocked the takeover.

   The Quaker Oats Co. on Monday reported earnings
tumbled 42.8 percent for the second quarter of its 1990 fiscal year
as its Fisher-Price subsidiary continued a sharp slide through a
disappointing year of toy sales.
   For the second quarter, earnings were $21.4 million, or 27 cents
a share, on revenue of $1.34 billion, compared with earnings of
$37.4 million, or 47 cents a share, on revenue of $1.35 billion in
the same 1989 period.
   Income for Quaker's U.S. and international grocery products
businesses, which account for about 85 percent of sales at the
Chicago-based company, were up compared to the same period last
year. But Fisher-Price's poor performance was expected to continue
through the end of the fiscal year in June, company officials said.
   The company also was hurt by increased financing costs, $17
million more than the same period last year, due largely to higher
interest expense and foreign exchange losses in Brazil.
   ``The results this quarter are disappointing and reflect
Fisher-Price's widely reported deteriorating performance over the
last several months,'' said William D. Smithburg, Quaker's chairman
and chief executive officer. He said Fisher-Price is likely to be
``only marginally profitable at best in the second half.''
   Fisher-Price lost $9.5 million in the second quarter, compared
to income of $9.8 million for the same period in 1989.
   Company spokesman Ronald G. Bottrell said Fisher-Price suffered
from sales and production problems with its 1989 toy line, but has
received strong early reviews on its 1990 line.
   Quaker's chief financial officer, Paul E. Price, took over as
president of Fisher-Price Jan. 4. He replaced Bruce Sampsell, who
left for a Buffalo, N.Y. bank holding company.
   For the first half of the fiscal year, earnings were $77.1
million, or 97 cents a share, on revenue of $2.8 billion, compared
with earnings of $82.4 million, or $1.04 a share, on revenue of
$2.8 billion for the same period last year.

   The stock market took another drubbing today,
resuming its early-1990 slide amid worries about the outlook for
corporate profits and interest rates.
   Analysts said traders remained uneasy about weak corporate
earnings reports for the fourth quarter of last year, as well as
the recent upturn in open-market interest rates.
   The Federal Reserve is seen as facing an increasingly difficult
set of choices in setting monetary policy to stave off a recession
while trying to keep inflation at bay.
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, will be making several
appearances before congressional committees in the near future.
   Wall Streeters will be watching closely to see what positions he
might take on such matters as the risk rising worldwide interest
rates might pose for the business outlook.

   Tandy Corp., parent company of Radio
Shack electronics stores and a major personal computer
manufacturer, reported a 12.8 percent drop in quarterly earnings as
demand faltered for home computers.
   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, net income was $117.63 million,
or $1.43 per share, compared with $135.05 million, or $1.50 per
share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Revenue for the
quarter rose to $1.46 billion from $1.4 billion in 1988.
   Tandy spokesman Philip Bradtmiller said the industry in general
had experienced slow sales in the home market for computers. About
70 percent of Tandy's revenues come from retail sales, the bulk of
it in Radio Shack stores.
   For the first half of Tandy's fiscal year, net income was
$180.39 million, or $2.14 per share, on revenue of $2.44 billion
compared with $199.96 million, or $2.23 per share, on $2.34 billion
in the comparable period.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Swedish company A.B. Bofors and
unidentified officials in the government of former Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi were charged with bribery Monday in connection with a
$1.4 million arms deal.
   Investigators said a full investigation of the 1986 artillery
contract would be made and Gandhi, whose Congress Party lost the
November elections, would be among those questioned.
   Bofors is accused of paying $50 million in kickbacks to win the
contract. In Sweden, company spokesman Johnny Ericsson said:
``We've had no direct contacts (with Indian officials) over this
and have no comments.''
   Preliminary charges filed in a special New Delhi court Monday by
the government of Prime Minister V.P. Singh named three people:
Gopichand Hinduja, an Indian industrialist based in London; Martin
Ardbo, president of Bofors when the contract was signed; and Win
Chadha, the Bofors agent in New Delhi.
   Hinduja issued a statement in London saying: ``I totally deny
that I am in any way involved in it.''
   Rajendra Shekhar, new director of the Central Bureau of
Investigation, told reporters that others accused included
officials of Bofors and of four companies through which kickbacks
allegedly were routed.
   He did not name the Gandhi government officials suspected of
involvement or say how many there were. Shekhar said he needed more
evidence before revealing identities.
   Asked whether Gandhi would be among those questioned, he said:
``He would be, obviously.''
   At least 640 million rupees was paid through Swiss banks to
clinch the sale of Bofors howitzers to India, the charges say. The
sum was worth $50 million in 1986, but now is equivalent to $37
million.
   Filing preliminary charges would help establish ``the principle
of dual criminality,'' enabling the bureau to seek cooperation
authorities in Sweden and Switzerland, said Shekhar, whom Singh
appointed earlier this month.
   He said his organization prepared the charges after seeing
classified documents related to the arms contract. Access to the
documents was granted in December, a few days after Singh took
office, Shekhar said.
   Singh's victory in the Nov. 22-26 general elections capped a
vociferous campaign in which he described corruption as flourishing
under Gandhi.
   Some politicians have claimed Gandhi shared in the kickbacks,
but lengthy newspaper investigations did not include direct
accusations against the former prime minister. Gandhi said in
Parliament neither he nor any member of his family received money.
   The scandal began in April 1987 when Swedish radio said Bofors
paid top officials and members of the Gandhi government to win the
contract, which French and Austrian companies also sought.
   These offenses are alleged in the 66 pages of charges filed
Monday with a New Delhi district judge: criminal conspiracy,
cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, forgery,
forgery for the purpose of cheating, criminal breach of trust and
abuse of official position by public servants.
   Shekhar denied suggestions by some reporters that his news
conference was politically motivated, although the Central Bureau
of Investigations seldom publicizes its investigations and legal
actions.

<HEAD>Kemp Tells Home Builders Current Slump No Cause for Panic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp
told a home builders' convention Monday to avoid alarm over the
industry's current slump.
   ``A lot of the current doom and gloom is contrary to the
facts,'' Kemp said. ``I don't believe housing is going to be
America's next crisis.''
   In a speech to the National Association of Home Builders, Kemp
acknowledged that last month's 8 percent decline in housing starts,
the recent softening of real estate prices and the crisis in the
savings and loan industry are an ``understandable cause for
concern.''
   But he said efforts by the Bush administration to lower interest
rates and the proposed cut in the capital gains tax, themes sounded
by President Bush in his speech Friday to the NAHB, could help
revive the fortunes of the industry.
   Both measures appear to have strong support in the industry, as
their mention in the speeches by Bush and Kemp drew applause.
   A capital gains tax cut, he said, ``will reinvigorate the real
estate market, the equity market, the bond market and other
financial markets.''
   Opponents of the cut say it would favor mainly big investors and
people making more than $100,000 a year.
   ``What some on the left forget is that the capital gains tax
doesn't just help old wealth, it's an incentive for the creation of
new wealth,'' Kemp told the home builders.
   Kemp's speech came as the NAHB wrapped up its four-day
convention in Atlanta, electing Martin Perlman of Houston as its
new president.
   The association also announced Monday, in conjunction with the
Federal National Mortgage Association, a new program to assist
low-and moderate-income families in buying their own homes.
   Five cities will be selected for the pilot program, which will
build on existing projects already under way, officials said.
   The program will include designing innovative housing and
low-cost approaches to development; encouragement of local
governments to be more flexible in zoning, building standards and
taxation to make homes more affordable; and special financing
programs.

<HEAD>Continental Seeks Permission to Fly Non-Stop to Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines Chairman Frank Lorenzo
announced Monday that Continental will ask for government approval
to fly four non-stop weekly flights from Houston to Tokyo.
   The Houston-based airline is among eight U.S. carriers seeking
the Department of Transportation's approval to fly non-stop to
Tokyo, Continental officials said at a news conference at a
Japanese restaurant.
   Despite the intense competition for 24 weekly non-stop flights
to Tokyo, Lorenzo said he believes Continental's chances are
excellent.
   The 24 available flights are the result of an agreement signed
by the U.S. and Japan last November.
   Continental, a subsidiary of Houston-based Texas Air, wants
permission to fly four weekly non-stop flights to Tokyo. It already
has a request pending with the DOT to offer three weekly one-stop
flights to Tokyo.
   ``Continental is very excited to attempt to provide a very
important service for Houston,'' Lorenzo said.
   ``There are just so many areas from which direct service from
Houston to Tokyo will benefit,'' he said.
   Lorenzo noted there are 125 Japanese companies with Houston
offices, and 109 Houston companies that do business in the Pacific
Rim.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent said he expected a decision on the
one-stop request to be issued sometime in the next few weeks. He
did not know when the DOT might decide on the request for non-stop
service.
   Lorenzo said if both requests are approved, Continental could
begin one-stop service in August and non-stop flights beginning in
early 1991.
   Last May, Continental began non-stop service between Seattle and
Tokyo. Continental has 56 weekly departures from Japan, but only
seven of them travel to the U.S. mainland.

   The dollar rose against most major currencies
Monday despite a steep slide in stock prices on Wall Street.
   Gold prices ended lower. In New York, gold for current delivery
fell $2.80 to $407.20 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange.
Republic National Bank of New York later quoted an ounce of gold
bullion at $408.20, down $1.80 from Friday's late bid.
   The dollar benefited from sales of West German marks. Currency
dealers dumped marks as they mulled the implications of fighting in
Soviet Azerbaijan and rumors of unrest in Eastern Europe, said John
McCarthy, chief dealer at the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank's office in
New York.
   But the dollar rally met resistance amid speculation about
possible central bank intervention to curb its advance, he said.
   Enthusiasm to buy dollars also was tempered in the afternoon as
the stock market piled up losses.
   ``I'm quite surprised the dollar isn't lower given that the
stock market is down a ton,'' McCarthy said.
   A belief that the Federal Reserve Board is unlikely to ease its
monetary policy _ which contributed to Wall Street's selloff _
fortified the dollar.
   Worries about the outlook for corporate profit growth and
impatience for lower interest rates sent stocks tumbling. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials fell 77.45 to 2,600.45, for its
largest one-day point loss since it took a 190-point drop last Oct.
13.
   In 14 sessions since the average began the new year by hitting a
record high, it has dropped 209.70 points, or 7.47 percent.
   The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo with a rise of 0.09
yen to a closing level of 146.42 yen. Later, in London, it was
quoted at 146.45 yen and in New York, the dollar was quoted at
146.505 yen, up from 145.925 yen late Friday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6385 from $1.6475 late
Friday. In later New York trading, a pound cost $1.6370, compared
to late Friday's $1.6470.
   Of the major currencies, only the Canadian dollar strengthed
against the U.S. dollar.
   Selected dollar rates late Monday compared with Friday's late
levels included: 1.7242 West German marks, up from 1.7105; 1.5350
Swiss francs, up from 1.5205; 5.859 French francs, up from 5.8130;
1.18015 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1836; and 1,283.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,274.12.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, were: 1.7230 West German marks, up from 1.7050; 1.5325
Swiss francs, up from 1.5140; 5.8550 French francs, up from 5.6955;
1.9370 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9310; 1,281.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,269.25; and 1.1826 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1786.
   Gold prices eased while silver was mixed.
   The late bid for gold in London was $405.25 a troy ounce, down
from $410.25 late Friday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing
bid of $405.75 from $408.65 bid late Friday. Gold fell $1.50 an
ounce to close at a bid $407.85 in Hong Kong.
   Silver for January delivery rose to $5.268 a troy ounce on New
York's Commodity Exchange from Friday's settlement price of $5.202.
Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.20 a troy ounce
from Friday's $5.22.

   Stock prices nosedived Monday to their lowest
levels since last autum, extending the market's early-1990 slide
amid worries about the outlook for corporate profits and interest
rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 77.45 to 2,600.45,
for its largest one-day point loss since it took a 190-point drop
last Oct. 13.
   In 14 sessions since the average began the new year by hitting a
record high, it has dropped 209.70 points, or 7.47 percent.
   Declining issues swamped advances by about 5 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 267 up,
1,336 down and 368 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders remained unsettled by weak corporate
earnings reports for the fourth quarter of last year, as well as
the recent upturn in open-market interest rates.
   Many observers believe the Federal Reserve is facing an
increasingly difficult set of choices in setting monetary policy to
stave off a recession while trying to keep inflation at bay.
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, is scheduled to make several
appearances before congressional committees in the near future.
   Wall Streeters will be watching closely to seewhat positions he

   Losers among the blue chips included General Electric, down 2 at
62~; Philip Morris, down 1\ at 38; Union Carbide, down 1| at 20~;
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down 1| at 40{, and International
Business Machines, down 2 at 96|.
   Oil, auto, retailing, pharmaceutical and regional telephone
issues all posted broad losses.
   Helene Curtis fell 3{ to 19\, for the biggest percentage decline
among NYSE issues. The company said it expects to report a slightly
smaller earnings gain for the fiscal year ending Feb. 28 than had
been projected.
   Delta Air Lines, which reported lower fourth-quarter profits,
lost ~ to 65~.
   First Executive Corp., the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market, tumbled 3 to 4. The insurance holding
company, which has a big investment in ``junk'' bonds, said it
expects to post a substantial loss for the past year.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $74.06 billion, or 2.25
percent, in value.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 148.38 million
shares, down from 172.26 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 181.60 million shares.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 4.36 to 183.20.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 10.29 to 379.68, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 8.77 at 330.38.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost

index closed at 360.88, down 5.20.

   Energy futures fell in volatile trading Monday
despite wintery weather that swept across the country.
   The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the main
grade of U.S. crude oil, tumbled $1.12 to close at $22.55 per
42-gallon barrel after trading in a $2 range during the session.
   Analysts said concern about a possible surplus of crude oil
prompted a late selling spree on the final day before the February
contract expired at the close of trading.
   Other contract months posted smaller losses. The March contract
fell 31 cents to $21.77 a barrel and April fell 22 cents to $21.15.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, No. 2 heating oil
for February delivery fell 2.67 cents to 60.99 cents a gallon after
trading in a wide range. The contract closed last week with a
0.94-cent gain after five rocky sessions.
   The March heating oil contract lost 1.68 cents to settle at
58.00 cents a gallon while April ended down 1.32 cents at 55.50
cents.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for February delivery declined 0.98
cent to 60.64 cents a gallon, March lost 1.37 cents to 61.32 cents
and April slipped 1.49 cents to 61.94 cents a gallon.
   ``The focus was on the crude contract expiration,'' said Linda
Simard, energy analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``People
heard there were plenty of sweet cargos available and crude fell
out.''
   Buyers drove crude prices up late last week amid concern about
possible tight supplies of light, sweet crude, which is sought by
refiners to make gasoline.
   Heating oil's decline Monday despite the return of wintery
weather to many parts of the nation surprised some analysts.
Heating oil prices hit record levels in December as cold weather
drove up demand.
   However, industry statistics last week suggested that
inventories were climbing faster than many expected as imported oil
ordered during the cold weather replaced depleted supplies.

   The high cost of nursing home insurance places
it out of reach for most older Americans and demonstrates the need
for a government program to protect people against the staggering
costs of long-term care, an advocacy group said Monday.
   The Families USA Foundation released a study saying that 84
percent of Americans from ages 65 to 79 cannot afford even a basic
nursing home insurance policy and most companies do not issue
policies to people age 80 and older.
   Executive Director Ron Pollack called the findings shocking and
said they bolster the case for a social insurance solution akin to
Social Security, spreading the benefits and costs across the
population. Any long-term care proposal keyed to private insurance
``is going to be a failed policy,'' he said.
   ``The fact is that grandma can't afford long-term care
insurance,'' Pollack said. ``Private insurance that claims to
protect older Americans from the high cost of nursing homes is
itself so expensive that only the very richest elderly can afford
the premiums.''
   Don White, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Association of
America, said the organization hopes to see a public-private
solution to the long-term care problem, with private insurers
playing a far larger role than that envisioned by Families USA.
About 40 percent of elderly people can afford to buy private
long-term care insurance, according to HIAA.
   ``It's clear that the government can't do the job by itself, the
private companies can't do the job by themselves, we've got to do
it together,'' White said. ``It's the role of the government to
provide for those who are poor or near poor, those who need
government assistance.''
   With the costs of nursing home care averaging more than $2,000 a
month, older Americans and their families have been voicing
increasing concern about the need for protection against such
staggering costs.
   Private long-term care insurance was virtually non-existent
before 1980 but the market has grown rapidly in recent years, with
more than 100 companies now offering policies and more than 1.3
million policies having been sold by mid-1989.
   Families USA studied the average cost of basic policies issued
by nine leading insurance companies and found that annual premiums
averaged $1,255 when purchased at age 65. At age 79, premiums
averaged $3,860.
   Policies were considered unaffordable when annual premiums
pushed total health care costs to more than 10 percent of a
person's yearly income and annuitized assets.
   ``The fact is that nursing home insurance is well beyond the
reach of most elderly couples and the situation is even tougher for
widows or widowers, who are most in need of long-term care,''
Pollack said. Some older people who fear the high costs of nursing
home care purchase insurance that is ``far beyond their means'' and
forego meals and medicine to pay for it, he said.
   Pollack said public opinion surveys indicate most Americans
would be willing to pay extra taxes for long-term care protection.
He said possible financing mechanisms could include added payroll
taxes or changes in the gift and estate tax.
   The foundation said it was sending copies of its report to the
Pepper Commission, made up of members of Congress and White House
appointees, which is trying to come up with a solution to the
long-term care problem.
   The commission estimates 9 million Americans currently need
long-term care, with the numbers expected to grow as the population
ages.

<HEAD>Orange Juice Futures Soar On New Damage Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orange juice futures prices soared to record highs Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade following a government report showing far
more damage to the Florida orange crop from last month's freeze
than traders had expected.
   On other futures markets, stock-index futures plunged along with
the stock market; pork futures surged while livestock futures were
mixed; energy futures fell; precious metals were mixed; and grains
and soybeans were mixed.
   Futures prices for frozen concentrated orange juice soared 4.3
cents to 7.55 cents with the spot contract for January delivery
settling at $1.9625 a pound and the more heavily traded March
contract at $2.0535.
   The March settlement price was the highest ever for an orange
juice futures contract, eclipsing the previous high of $2.0425 set
July 18, 1988, after frost damaged the Brazilian orange crop.
   The rally was largely a reaction to a report released Friday by
the Florida state division of the Agriculture Department that said
only 32 percent of the orange crop escaped damage from the
Christmas freeze, compared with a previous estimate of 44 percent.
   Buyers were also reacting to an announcement Monday by Brazilian
orange juice processors that they were raising their price for
orange juice concentrate 20 cents to an effective rate of about
$2.08 a pound, said analyst Ernie Thomas of Merrill Lynch Consumer
Markets Inc. in Winter Haven, Fla.
   Brazilian imports are expected to make up for the frost-related
shortfall in U.S. supplies.
   U.S. processors are asking about $2.15 for concentrate, Thomas
said.
   ``We definitely had more damage than we originally thought and
it just seems to get worse every day,'' Thomas said.
   Analyst Judy Ganes of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said the
extent of freeze damage is especially disturbing because it
occurred in citrus groves located further south than in 1983, when
the last freeze of comparable severity hit, and the damage is worse.
   Stock-index futures prices tumbled on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange as the Dow Jones index of 30 industrials plunged 77.45
points amid worries about the outlook for corporate profits and
interest rates.
   The Merc's contract for March delivery of stocks represented by
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled 10.3 points lower at
331.40. The contract is worth $500 a point.
   Pork futures rose strongly on the Chicago Merc amid rumors that
Romania and the Soviet Union were looking to buy U.S. pork products.
   Similar rumors circulated last week, but so far only sales of
beef livers and hearts to Romania have been announced.
   ``The bottom line is that both the Romanians and the Russians
have reasons to buy meat but the real problem is that they don't
have much money,'' said Tom Morgan, president of Sterling Research
Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Cattle futures finished mixed amid positioning ahead of
Wednesday quarterly USDA cattle-on-feed report.
   Live cattle futures settled unchanged to .10 cent lower with
February at 79.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .45
cent higher with January at 84.30 cents a pound; live hogs were .23
cent to .60 cent higher with February at 50.12 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .15 cent lower to 1.90 cents higher with
February at 57.05 cents a pound.
   Most petroleum futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, largely on selling related to the expiration of the
February crude oil contract, which went off the board at $22.55
barrel, down $1.12.
   Other West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures ended 31 cents
lower to 8 cents higher with March at $21.77 a barrel; heating oil
was .97 cent to 2.67 cents lower with February at 60.99 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .98 cent to 1.51 cents lower with
February at 60.64 cents a gallon.
   Gold futures slipped on New York's Commodity Exchange in
reaction to the stronger dollar; silver futures advanced in a
technically inspired rebound after last week's sharp decline.
   Gold futures finished $2.80 to $2.90 lower with February at $408
a troy ounce; silver was 6.3 cents to 6.5 cents higher with March
at $5.315 a troy ounce.
   Wheat futures prices closed higher Monday on the Chicago Board
of Trade in a technical correction. Corn was lower and soybeans
finished mixed.
   The January soybean contract expired at noon CST at $5.54{ a
bushel, down 3{ cents.
   Wheat futures were { cent to 3{ cents higher with the contract
for delivery in March at $3.92{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 2}

<HEAD>Investment Banker Left Trail of Falsehoods, Newspaper Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investment banker Jeffrey Beck, an adviser on
some of the biggest U.S. corporate takeovers ever, lied about his
past, fabricating stories about his background and military service
and claiming to work for the CIA, according to a published report
Monday.
   Beck, who cultivated a colorful image that included the nickname
``Mad Dog,'' rose to stardom on Wall Street even though one of his
tales helped kill a planned billion-dollar buyout of Northwest
Industries Inc. in 1985, the Wall Street Journal reported.
   Beck, 43, a member of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s mergers and
acquisitions department, allegedly told friends and colleagues over
the years that he was a decorated veteran of the Army's Special
Forces in Vietnam, that he did intelligence work for the government
and that he would inherit a family fortune of $2 billion, the
Journal said.
   However, the Journal said after interviewing friends, family,
colleagues and acquaintances of the investment banker, none of the
stories apparently was true. Drexel and Oppenheimer &amp; Co., Beck's
previous employer, kept him in their mergers and acquisitions
departments although many of his co-workers did not believe his
stories, the Journal said.
   Beck tendered a preliminary resignation to Drexel a couple of
weeks ago, Drexel spokesman Steve Anreder told The Associated Press
on Monday. The investment firm agreed to discuss the matter further
with him but Beck has been unavailable, Anreder said.
   Beck was said to be out of his office when an AP reporter called
for comment on the Journal's story Monday.
   The Journal said that during an interview, Beck denied that he
had told most of the stories that were attributed to him by what
the newspaper called business associates, friends and others.
   ``This is getting wilder and wilder,'' he told the newspaper.
``I am beyond shock.''
   Beck, who claimed his troops in Vietnam nicknamed him ``Mad
Dog,'' acknowledged there were no official records of his Vietnam
service, but said he had made trips to Vietnam, the newspaper
reported.
   Beck also was said to have claimed he had done years of
intelligence work, but he denied to the Journal that he told people
he worked for the CIA or that he would inherit a $2 billion fortune.
   Beck is a ``rainmaker,'' one who drums up takeover business for
investment firms. He has been highly successful, working as an
adviser to the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. on a
number of deals, including its record $24.53 billion purchase of
RJR Nabisco Inc. in 1988.
   Beck in 1986 had helped bring KKR general partner Henry Kravis
and investor Donald Kelly together in the $6.2 billion buyout of
Beatrice Cos., at the time the biggest non-oil company takeover
ever.
   But when Beck was with Oppenheimer, his story-telling
contributed to the collapse of the Northwest Industries deal.
   In an account confirmed by Oppenheimer, the Journal said the
firm was putting together a buyout of Northwest Industries when one
investor backed out, leaving Oppenheimer and its partners $75
million short of their needed financing.
   Beck pledged to make up the shortfall from his own fortune. But
after Oppenheimer colleague Stephen McGrath confronted Beck about
his claims of wealth, Donald Kelly withdrew from the deal and it
foundered.
   Northwest later merged with Farley Industries in a $1.04 billion
transaction.
   Oppenheimer did not dismiss Beck until six months later, after
being given an ultimatum by McGrath, the Journal said.
   When asked why there was a delay between the incident and Beck's
firing, Oppenheimer spokesman John Ryan declined comment. He also
refused to say whether any disciplinary action was taken against
Beck.
   Shortly after his dismissal, Beck joined Drexel's mergers and
acquisitions department. At Drexel he courted RJR Nabisco President
F. Ross Johnson, whobegan the bidding war for the food and tobacco
giant. At their second meeting, the Journal said, Johnson brought
along a box of Milk Bone dog biscuits as a joke on Beck's nickname
_ and Beck at the whole box.
   Johnson sought the advice of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and
Drexel ended up advising Henry Kravis.
   Because of his dealmaking abilities, Beck enjoyed great
notoriety on Wall Street.
   The Journal said David Aaron, an Oppenheimer
employee-turned-author, used Beck as the model for the main
character of his book ``Agent of Influence.''
   Beck also served as a technical adviser and had a cameo role in
director Oliver Stone's film ``Wall Street.'' He befriended the
film's star, Michael Douglas, who was impressed by Beck's war
stories and became interested in making a film about them, the
Journal said.
   However, the Journal quoted people familiar with the project as
saying Douglas and screenwriter David Black came to believe that
Beck's stories were false and dropped the project.
   Beck also is the subject of a book, ``Rainmaker,'' being written
by Business Week reporter Anthony Bianco, the Journal said.

<HEAD>Chrysler Setting Up 2nd Joint Vehicle Production Venture in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. said Monday it would form a joint
venture with an Austrian company to make a European version of the
automakers' popular minivans beginning next year.
   The move is further recognition by Chrysler of the growing
importance of the European market. Trade barriers among the 12
nations belonging to the European Economic Community fall in 1992,
and will create a vehicle market larger than North America.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have had European
manufacturing plants for years. GM makes Opel and Vauxhall cars in
Europe and Ford markets European-built Fords. Chrysler exports some
cars and minivans to Europe under the Chrysler nameplate, along
with its Jeep brand sport-utility vehicles.
   The deal announced Monday between the No. 3 automaker and
Steyr-Daimler-Puch Fahrzeugtechnik is the second joint
manufacturing venture between a European vehicle maker and the U.S.
automaker, which has no manufacturing plants on its own in Europe.
   Chrysler and Renault are involved in a joint program to make a
sport-utility vehicle, code-named the ``JJ,'' to be built beginning
in 1992 at yet-to-be-announced plants in North American and either
Spain or Portugal.
   The Chrysler-Austrian project will use a factory at Graz, and
the Austrian company will provide European component engineering in
addition to assembly facilities.
   Details of the agreement, including production targets and
marketing plans, will be worked out within two months, Chrysler
spokeswoman Karen Stewart said from company headquarters in
Highland Park, Mich.
   ``They had to so something a little different,'' said auto
analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
``If you wanted to start from scratch, you would go to Spain or
Portugal for the labor costs.
   ``This is an existing facility,'' she said of the Austrian
plant, ``so they save a lot of money and it's faster to get it into
production.''
   Analysts have said the minivan and sport-utility segments are
relatively small, and hold good potential for growth within the
European market. For years, Volkswagen of West Germany has produced
and marketed a passenger van there, but its design is different
than U.S. minivans. The French vehicle maker Renault sells the
Espace minivan, but in relatively low volumes.
   Chrysler controls more than half of the U.S. minivan market with
its Plymouth Voyager, Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town &amp; Country
vehicles, and sold more than 500,000 of the vehicles last year in
North America. It exported about 8,800 minivans to Europe in 1989
from assembly plants in St. Louis, Mo., and Windsor, Ontario.
   Two years ago, Chrysler exported North American-built Chrysler
cars and Jeeps to Europe. Exports reached 50,000 in 1989.
   In 1983, American Motors Corp. established in China the Beijing
Jeep Corp., which Chrysler inherited when it bought AMC in 1987.
Chrysler owns about a third of Beijing Jeep, which produces mostly
commercial vehicles for the Chinese market.

<HEAD>Merrill Lynch Reports $362 Million Fourth-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. on Monday reported a $362
million fourth-quarter loss, including a one-time charge of $470
million for a drastic restructuring at the nation's largest
brokerage.
   The pretax charge, which analysts called the largest ever for a
securities firm, comes during a period of wide retrenchment on Wall
Street because of slow business since the October 1987 stock market
crash.
   For all of 1989, Merrill Lynch reported a loss of $213 million,
compared to profits of $463 million the previous year.
   Merrill Chairman William A. Schreyer blamed the decline on Wall
Street's hard times characterized by an exodus of small investors,
a severe drop in the junk bond market, low return on some products
and increased competition.
   The firm, touted as ``A Breed Apart'' in newspaper and
television advertisements, in November began the restructuring,
which includes layoffs estimated at more than 4,000.
   While other firms have reduced staff because of a slowdown in
retail brokerage and investment banking, Merrill's cuts have been
the most stunning because of the firm's pre-eminence on Wall Street.
   ``It's scary that the costs could run this high to do what
they've done here,'' said analyst Lawrence Eckenfelder of
Prudential Bache Securities Corp. in San Francisco. ``What it
suggests is there's an awful lot more to come out there, I'm sure
at other firms as well.''
   Merrill's quarterly loss, which amounted to $3.56 a share,
compared with earnings of $276 million, or $2.69 a share, for the
same 1988 period. Revenue for the quarter ending Dec. 29 was $2.8
billion, up from $2.67 billion in the 1988 quarter.
   Merrill reported that quarterly revenue from principal
transactions declined nearly 50 percent to $169 million from $321
million the previous year.
   For the full year, Merrill reported a per share loss of $2.31.
In 1988, Merrill reported a profit of $463 million, or $4.29 a
share. Revenue for 1989 was $11.3 billion, up 16 percent from $9.75
billion in 1988.
   But the revenue increase was due mainly to a 35 percent rise in
interest and dividends. Revenue sank 18.6 percent for principal
transactions and 6.3 percent from investment banking, while
commission revenue gained 12.3 percent.
   Merrill said the two areas of decline reflected markdowns in the
firm's inventory of high-yield bonds. The junk bond market was
battered in 1989 because of a series of huge defaults and declines
in the use of the securities to finance mergers and takeovers.
   The firm's 1988 full-year and fourth-quarter results included a
$255 million after-tax gain from the termination of a Merrill
pension plan.
   Merrill said the restructuring charge resulted from divesting
some products lines and business activities; consolidating and
relocating some domestic and international retail, institutional
and other facilities; and reducing the size of other operations.
   The bulk of the charge came from paying off office leases,
severance payments and asset writeoffs from reduced operations.
Merrill officials said they expected the reductions eventually
would save the firm $100 million to $200 million a year.
   Merrill plans to lay off about 3,000 workers by the end of 1990
through layoffs, attrition and selling off businesses.
   The reductions would drop Merrill's total work force to about
36,800, compared with 40,500 at the end of 1989 and a peak of
47,000 shortly before the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Merrill recently cut an additional 700 positions by selling its
Canadian retail brokerage operation and eliminated 300 more jobs
through cuts in its Broadcort Capital Corp. account-clearing
business.
   Since November, Merrill also has abandoned the European
commercial paper business, eliminated one equity division at its
New York headquarters and reduced trading of British stocks.
   Merrill's stock price dropped 62{ cents a share to $24.12{ in
New York Stock Exchange trading Monday. The earnings were announced
after the market closed.
   Only Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which has slashed its work
force by more than 40 percent since resolving securities fraud
charges, has engineered a more dramatic cutback. Overall, Wall
Street has eliminated more than 23,000 since the crash.

   The Congress returning Tuesday from a long
holiday recess is all but sure to enact tougher air-pollution
controls, but battles remain over how much the legislation should
cost and who should pay.
   ``There will be a long, formidable .... no doubt at times
contentious debate,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, told reporters Monday. ``It is imperative that we act not
only for ourselves but for the future generations.''
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Environmental and
Public Works subcommittee that originated the bill and chief
sponsor of the legislation, said ``all interested parties know
there will be a clean-air bill'' this year.
   The broad-reaching clean-air bill that will begin to be
scrutinized on the Senate floor Tuesday calls for cutting acid-rain
pollutants in half, much tighter controls on automobile emissions
and greatly reducing toxic chemical releases.
   The estimated annual cost of the various proposals ranges from
$14 billion to $100 billion. Supporters of the legislation argue
that some of the costs are being exaggerated and that reduced
health-care costs will recoup some of the money.
   President Bush said last week that he's prepared to veto any
legislation that goes substantially beyond the $19 billion proposal
he sent to Capitol Hill last summer.
   ``I want to sign a clean-air bill this year, ... but I will only
sign legislation that balances environmental and economic
progress,'' Bush said in a letter to the Senate.
   Mitchell said the Senate legislation would cost slightly more
than the bill proposed by the White House, but called the
president's cost assessment inflated. He said it was ``extremely
unlikely'' that the president would veto a clean-air bill, even the
current Senate legislation.
   ``A cheaper solution is often not the best solution,'' he said.
   Congress faces other major issues, including reducing the budget
deficit, subsidizing child care for working parents, reforming
campaign-finance laws, extending farm programs and stepping up the
war on drugs.
   There also will be fights over Bush's proposal to cut the
capital gains tax and a proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., to cut the Social Security tax.
   A key to the budget battle will be how deeply defense spending
can be cut in light of the recent move toward democracy in Eastern
Europe and the lessening of East-West tensions. Some lawmakers say
that ``peace dividend'' should be used for domestic programs.
   With more than 100 million people breathing air the government
considers unhealthy and growing concern over the destruction of
streams and lakes by acid rain, there is little disagreement over
the need for tougher federal air-pollution controls.
   Lawmakers argue that while new curbs will be expensive, doing
nothing may be even more costly.
   Fran DuMelle of the American Lung Association said the annual
health costs associated to air pollution five years ago was
estimated at $15 billion to $40 billion. Today, the $40 billion
figure ``has become a middle range'' and the health toll continues
to rise, she said.
   The framework of a tougher air-pollution law seems set on
Capitol Hill, but major details continue to be the subject of
intense behind-the-door maneuvering.
   Mitchell, a longtime advocate of tougher clean-air legislation,
said action is needed this year or the country's determination to
deal with environmental problems will questioned worldwide.
   A House version, not as tough as the Senate bill but closer to
what Bush wants, remains in committee. Even after both chambers
complete their bills, there will be tough bargaining before final
compromise legislation goes to the president.
   One of the major disagreements over a clean-air bill involves
the continuing regional conflict over whether states with the
dirtiest utility plants should pay all clean-up costs.
   Saying reduced acid-rain pollution benefits everyone, senators
from a string of states from Pennsylvania to Missouri _ where the
dirtiest utility plants are located _ want the costs spread
nationwide through an energy tax or fee.
   Legislators from other states balk at the proposal, and Bush has
said he would veto any measure that includes such a cost-sharing
tax.
   ``It's hard to see why consumers in states that have already
done their part should be paying a second time for those who have
dragged their feet,'' said Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich.
   ``Cost sharing is dead on arrival,'' Baucus said.
   Nevertheless, an accommodation aimed at easing some of the
Midwesterners' concerns is expected. Various proposals are being
discussed, including one that would give the dirtiest utility
plants extra pollution credits that could be sold to other parts of
the country to defer clean-up costs.
   Meanwhile, industries most affected, including automakers and
oil companies, have unleashed lobbying campaigns aimed at blunting
the most expensive pollution controls under consideration. One
target has been tough proposed auto tailpipe pollution controls
that would go into effect in 2003 and for which there is no
available technology to bring cars into compliance.
   Supporters of the so-called ``Stage II'' controls say automakers
need to be pushed into developing better technology. The estimated
cost of the provision has ranged from $135 a car to, according to
auto companies, at least $500 a car.

   The Bush administration said Monday it will
move to end controls on overseas sales of computers and other
technology readily available to the public.
   The policy overhaul will have an immediate effect on much of
Eastern Europe but no immediate effect on the Soviet Union.
   Meanwhile, sevral U.S. officials have opened talks in London to
prepare for joint steps by 17 nations to accelerate delivery of
advanced technology to such countries as Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia.
   ``The political and military environment is changing ... The
situation is different today than it was a year ago,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   For more than 40 years, the United States and its allies have
imposed stiff curbs on technology sales to Communist countries on
security grounds. But the advent of Mikhail S. Gorbachev as leader
of the Soviet Union in 1985 and the spread of reform in the Eastern
Bloc spured many Western governments to push for an easing of
restrictions.
   At a National Security Council meeting on Friday, the Bush
administration decided to take a softer approach, as well, sources
said. Two parallel decisions were made: To work out a joint
agreement at a meeting in Paris next month to provide advanced
technology to Eastern Europe and to conduct a comprehensive review
of U.S. policy.
   Officials of the State Department, the Pentagon and the Commerce
Department participated in the decision. State and Commerce were
more willing to permit the technology transfers than the Defense
Department.
   The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said the
underlining U.S. principles were:
   _Support for reform in Eastern Europe.
   _Strengthening protection for ``truly strategic'' goods and
technologies.
   _More rapid modernization of the current lists of controlled
items.
   _Decontrol of off-the-shelf commodities readily availble to the
general public.
   She said the administration wanted to take advantage of a
``changing enviornment'' in Eastern Europe. In the Soviet Union,
she said, ``the situation has not evolved to the same extent.''
   Fitzwater called the steps being taken ``a prudent change ...
that will not jeopardize strategic interests.''
   A group of U.S. officials led by Allan Wendt, of the State
Department's office of strategic technology policy, flew to London
over the weekend to meet with British officials.
   The officials will go on to The Netherlands, West Germany and
Italy. Meanwhile, delegations from Canada and Japan will come to
Washington for talks this week and French and Danish experts are
due here next week.
   The discussions are in preparation for a meeting in Paris in
mid-February of Cocom, the Coordination Committee for Multilateral
Export Control. There, the United States hopes to work out details
of what kind of equipment will be cleared for Eastern Europe and
how much of it.
   Cocom, which includes all 16 NATO countries except Iceland, plus
Japan and Australia, attempts to coordinate Western deliveries of
technology to Eastern European countries. The United States has
been among the most reluctant to provide high technology to allies
of the Soviet Union.
   The countries likely to be assisted include Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia, all of which have shed communist domination nd are
adopting capitalistic approaches to their weak economies.
   The meeting in Paris is designed to adopt uniform rules to guide
technology transfers. In this respect, the administration's
decision to liberalize restrictions could be balanced against the
more eager approaches of some other Cocom members and produce a
compromise.
   The net result, however, would be to deliver better computers
and telecommunications equipment to members of the Eastern Bloc
provided semi-sensitive technology is not then turned over to the
Soviet Union.

   Phillips Petroleum Co. received a $92
million settlement Monday from the government of Iran and the
National Iranian Oil Co. for a 1981 claim for the expropriation of
Phillips' interest in two offshore oil fields.
   Phillips filed the claim with the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal,
which in June awarded Phillips about $110 million for expropriation
of the company's one-sixth interest in the oil fields.
   Iran followed with counterclaims against Phillips, which the
Tribunal did not dispose of because of lack of jurisdiction,
regarding oil received by Phillips under the purchase contract.
   The $92 million settlement ends all claims and counterclaims
between Iran and Phillips, said Phillips spokesman George Minter.
   Phillips received a net payment Monday of $91 million because of
a statutory fee of $1 million deducted by the U.S. Treasury
Department.

<HEAD>Dollar Opens Higher in Tokyo, Stocks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose slightly at the opening of trading
in Tokyo Tuesday while stock prices slipped.
   The dollar started at 146.66 yen, up 0.24 yen from Monday's
Tokyo close.
   Yoshitsuyu Hanada, a dealer at Mitsui Bank, said the U.S.
currency picked up on the trend in New York trading, where the
dollar climbed over the 146-yen barrier to 146.50 yen late Monday.
   However, the dollar's rise may lose steam, Hanada suggested. The
boost given the dollar by instability in Eastern bloc nations has
run its course, he said.
   Dealers also are edgy over an expected announcement by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on U.S. interest rates, he said.
The dollar is likely to remain within the 146-yen range as a
result, he said.
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost some of their
Monday gains in early trading.
   At 9:30 a.m., the Nikkei Stock Average was down 71.58 points, or
0.2 percent, at 37,185.43. It had gained 420.47 Monday to close at
37,257.01.

<HEAD>Amoco Profits Slide in 4Q; Amerada Hess, Arco Earnings Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Amoco Corp. said Monday its fourth-quarter earnings fell 15
percent because of special one-time gains in the previous year,
while Arco said higher oil prices helped its quarterly earnings
rise 3 percent and Amerada Hess Corp. posted a 7 percent rise in
profits as exploration and production earnings surged.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, Chicago-based Amoco earned
$319 million, or 62 cents a share, down from $375 million, or 72
cents a share, in the comparable 1988 period. Revenue rose 10
percent to $6.8 billion from $6.2 billion.
   Amoco Chairman Richard Morrow said 1988 fourth-quarter earnings
benefitted from one-time factors, mainly natural gas settlements.
Without those factors, earnings in the latest quarter would have
been about the same as in the 1988 quarter.
   For the year, Amoco's net income fell 22 percent to $1.6
billion, or $3.12 a share, from $2.1 billion, or $4 a share, in
1988. Revenue advanced 12 percent to $26.8 billion from $23.9
billion.
   Restructuring costs and provisions for environmental programs
depressed earnings for the full year.
   Los Angeles-based Arco said its earnings rose 3 percent in the
fourth quarter and 23 percent in the year, largely because of
higher energy prices, lower interest expense and sale of a majority
stake in a petrochemical subsidiary.
   The energy company, formerly Atlantic Richfield Co., said it
earned $403 million, or $2.38 per share, in the quarter, up from
$391 million, or $2.22 per share, for the fourth quarter of 1988.
Quarterly revenues fell by 11.8 percent, to $4 billion from $4.5
billion.
   For the year Arco earned $1.95 billion, or $11.26 per share,
compared to $1.58 billion, $8.78 per share, in fiscal 1988.
Revenues fell 12.6 percent to $16.02 billion from $18.32 billion.
   Arco Chairman Lodwrick Cook said the company experienced higher
worldwide crude oil and refined product prices _ for example, the
average price for domestic crude oil rose to $13.13 a barrel last
year from $9.90 in 1988.
   Increased natural gas volumes and lower interest expense also
contributed to income growth, Cook said in a statement.
   ``We also realized a $634 million after-tax gain from the sale
of a majority interest in Lyondell Petrochemical Co. in January,''
he said. ``At the same time, however, the 1989 results reflect a
$345 million charge for future environmental expenses and other
provisions, as well as 50 percent less contribution from the
earnings of Lyondell.''
   The sale of 50.1 percent of Lyondell caused Arco to report lower
revenues in the fourth quarter and 1989. Lyondell accounted for
$4.7 billion of Arco's revenues in 1988.
   Arco also said it spent a total of $827 million to repurchase
8.3 million shares of its stock in 1989.
   New York-based Amerada Hess earned $70.8 million, or 88 cents a
share, up from $66.3 million, or 80 cents a share, in the
comparable 1988 period. Revenue rose about 3 percent to $1.5
billion from $1.2 billion.
   For the year, Amerada Hess' net earnings more than doubled to
$476 million, or $5.87 a share, from $124 million, or $1.51 a
share. Revenue totaled $5.7 billion, up 33 percent from $4.3
billion in the previous year.
   Exploration and production earnings totaled $33.9 million in the
fourth quarter compared with a loss of $300,000 in the 1988
quarter. Fourth-quarter 1988 results also included a charge of $30
million for capitalized exploration expenses related to properties
for which the company had no development plans.
   While refining and marketing earnings declined in the fourth
quarter, they more than doubled in the year, Amerada Hess reported.

<HEAD>Failed Merger Bid Helps Boost BellSouth Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BellSouth Corp. said Monday its fourth quarter
net income rose 11.8 percent, boosted largely by termination fees
stemming from its failed bid to acquire LIN Broadcasting Corp.
   Income rose to $469 million in the three months ended Dec. 31,
or 97 cents a share, from $419.3 million, or 90 cents a share, in
the comparable period a year earlier. Revenues rose 1.1 percent to
$3.62 billion from $3.58 billion.
   For all of 1989, net income rose 4.2 percent to $1.74 billion or
$3.64 a share from $1.67 billion or $3.51 a share in 1988. Revenues
for the year rose 2.9 percent to $14.0 billion from $13.6 billion
in 1988.
   LIN paid BellSouth $89 million to get out of a proposed merger
of cellular telephone operations. LIN scrapped the BellSouth deal
in December in favor of a $3.38 billion combination with McCaw
Cellular Communications Inc.
   BellSouth last April acquired Mobile Communications Corp. of
America, a transaction that contributed to a 12-month loss of $5.2
million for BellSouth's domestic mobile communications information
division.
   ``As we expected, our MCCA acquisition diluted earnings in 1989
but we continue to be pleased with the growth and vitality of the
cellular markets we serve,'' said BellSouth Chairman John L.
Clendenin.
   BellSouth, an Atlanta-based international telecommunications
holding company, includes Southern Bell and South Central Bell,
which together serve 70 percent of the population of nine
Southeastern states.

   Czechoslovakia has asked to join the
International Monetary Fund, a major source of loans to countries
in financial trouble, the fund announced Monday.
   China, Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia are already members.
Soviet leaders have said they would like to join the 152 countries
that make up the organization. The U.S. government, which holds the
biggest single block of votes, has said it does not consider the
Soviets ready.
   The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency estimated Czechoslovakia's
debt in 1988 at $6.1 billion, much less than Poland's $38.5 billion
and less than that of most other Eastern European countries. One
exception is Romania, which under the late President Nicolae
Ceausescu paid off virtually all its foreign debt.
   The fund's announcement recalled that Czechoslovakia was one of
the original members when the fund was organized just after World
War II but withdrew in 1954 after the Communists took over the
government. No difficulty is expected in winning membership
approval for Czechoslovakia to rejoin.
   The country probably will need financial help as it shifts from
state control of the economy to something closer to a market
system. The IMF specializes in short-term loans for countries with
payments difficulties.
   Membership in the fund also opens the way to membership in its
sister organization, the World Bank, also based in Washington. The
bank is the largest source of long-term development loans to the
Third World.
   A loan from the IMF can open the way to borrowing from other
lenders, including individual governments and private banks. The
fund has negotiated a $710 million loan to Poland and approval by
the member governments is expected soon.
   The application of Czechoslovakia and the prospect that East
Germany, Romania and Bulgaria may follow, come as the fund is
seeking a major increase in its resources _ now equivalent to about
$117 billion.
   Michel Camdessus, the fund's French managing director, has asked
for a doubling of quotas, as contributions are called, and most
member countrties went along. But the United States, Britain and
Saudi Arabia _ all influential members _ have argued for a smaller
increase.

<TEXT>
   U.S. legal obstacles to trade with the Soviet
Union will be gone by June, the president of the government's
Export-Import Bank predicted Monday.
   ``It's important because our competitors have about $12 billion
worth of trade business with the Soviets,'' Joseph D. Macomber told
the Bankers' Association for Foreign Trade. ``We've got a lot of
catching up to do.''
   Macomber predicted that the obstacles will be abolished before
President Bush meets the heads of other major industrialized
nations for their annual summit this year in Houston.
   The Export-Import Bank, which lends to purchasers in foreign
countries at subsidized rates to promote the sale of American
industrial products, is barred by law from lending to the Soviet
Union.
   The Bush administration has been waiting until the Supreme
Soviet passes a new law on emigration before it moves to lift the
restrictions, imposed by the 1975 Jackson-Vanik amendment. The
object of the amendment was to encourage freer movement of Jews out
of the Soviet Union.
   Another legal provision, the Stevenson amendment, sets a limit
of $300 million on what the bank can lend or guarantee in loans to
the Soviets. Macomber quoted one of his analysts as saying:
   ``That ought to get us through the first 30 days.''
   A third restriction, the Byrd amendment, puts a limit of $40
million on what can be lent to help finance Soviet energy
production.

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great Western Financial Corp., the
nation's second-largest thrift, said Monday it posted its first
quarterly loss in seven years, largely because of a $200 million
charge for bad real commercial and real estate loans.
   The writedown and a year-end increase in loan-loss reserves
helped produce a loss of $77.3 million or 59 cents a share in the
fourth quarter of 1989, compared to earnings of $59.7 million or 47
cents a share a year earlier, the company said.
   For all of 1989, Great Western's earnings fell 58 percent to
$100 million or 78 cents a share from $240 million or $1.95 a share
in 1988.
   Securities analysts had expected Great Western, considered one
of the nation's best-managed thrifts, to show some problems with
sour real estate loans in Arizona, Florida and other states.
   Net interest income increased 15 percent in 1989 to $956
million, compared to $832 million in 1988.
   Real estate lending totaled $11.1 billion, down from $11.5
billion in 1988, the company said. New loans, including real estate
and consumer lendig, totaled $13.1 billion for the year, slightly
below 1988's $13.2 billion.
   Great Western's assets rose 12 percent to $37 billion at the end
of 1989 from $33 billion a year earlier, the company said.

   A jury Monday night convicted a suspended
graduate student of federal computer tampering charges for
unleashing a ``worm'' that crippled a nationwide network of
thousands of computers.
   Robert T. Morris, 24, faces up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine. He is the first person brought to trial under a 1986
federal computer fraud and abuse law that makes it a felony to
break into a federal computer network and prevent authorized use of
the system.
   The jury returned its verdict about 9:30 p.m. after nearly six
hours of deliberation.
   U.S. District Court Judge Howard Munson did not set a sentencing
date.
   Morris, from Arnold, Md., testified during his trial that he had
made a programming error that caused a computer worm to go berserk
and cripple the Internet system Nov. 2, 1988.
   The worm he designed immobilized an estimated 6,000 computers
linked to Internet, including ones at NASA, military facilities and
major universities.
   Morris would not comment as he hurried from the federal
courthouse. But his father, also named Robert, said he did not
think the verdict was unfair.
   ``I have a great deal of faith in the American judicial system
and yet I'm still disappointed in the verdict,'' he said.
   Morris may not have intended his ``worm'' program to paralyze a
nationwide computer network in 1988, but it was no accident that
the worm attacked the network, U.S. Justice Department trial lawyer
Mark Rasch said in closing statements earlier in the day.
   ``The worm didn't break in by accident or mistake. Robert Morris
intended for the worm to break in,'' he said.
   Defense attorney Thomas Guidoboni argued that the suspended
Cornell University graduate student made a programming error that
caused the worm to go berserk and cripple the Internet system on
Nov. 2, 1988.
   ``It's not the side effects, it's not the mistakes, but what he
actually intended to do,'' said Guidoboni. ``He never intended to
prevent authorized access.''
   Prosecutor Ellen Meltzer reminded the jury in her summation that
testimony showed Morris deliberately stole computer passwords from
hundreds of people so the worm could break into as many computers
as possible.
   She added that Morris took deliberate and conscious steps to
make the rogue program difficult to detect and eradicate. He
unleashed the worm from the computer system at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge, and made it look like it was
sent by the University of California at Berkeley so authorship of
the program could not be traced to him at Cornell, she said.
   Ms. Meltzer said at least six earlier versions of the worm were
found on Morris' Cornell computer accounts and that his own
comments on the worm program used the words ``break-in'' and
``steal.''
   She told the jury that Morris' ``worm was not a juvenile prank.
... In no way was it a legitimate Cornell research project gone
awry.''
   Guidoboni insisted that Morris didn't intend to cause permanent
damage to computer files. ``There was no work lost, work was
delayed. That's the bottom line,'' he said.
   Morris took steps to limit the worm's growth, Guidoboni said.
   ``If he intended to bring the systems down, he didn't need to
control the growth. He could have just let this thing go,'' he said.
   He stressed that once Morris realized the worm had gone berserk,
he tried to stop it.
   While Guidoboni argued during the trial that Internet was
chiefly a system used by researchers to swap information, including
recipes and love letters, Meltzer contended it was far more
important.
   She said it also involved research on acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, weapons development, artificial intelligence and new
drugs.
