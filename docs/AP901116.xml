   Activists on Friday used the first anniversary of
the killing of six Jesuit priests to revive their fight against
U.S. aid for El Salvador, a cause long overshadowed by events in
Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
   In a rally in Los Angeles, meanwhile, 113 people were arrested
and cited for allegedly blocking entrances to the Federal Building,
where protests have been held weekly since the Nov. 16, 1989,
killings by Salvadoran soldiers.
   In New York City, about 50 out of 100 people holding a vigil
near the Salvadoran consulate were arrested and charged with
disorderly conduct for blocking the entrance to the building,
police said.
   Boston became the 10th U.S. city to join a boycott of coffee
made with Salvadoran beans, Jesuits held a memorial mass and
candlelight vigil, academics debated the Salvadoran civil war and a
peace group debuted a television ad that features footage of the
bodies of the murdered priests.
   ``It's sad that it took killings of people of that stature to
regain the attention of the American people,'' said Rob Everts,
director of the New England chapter of the peace group Neighbor to
Neighbor. ``They didn't die in vain. This tragedy was critical in
getting the attention of policy makers.''
   The six priests were slain with their housekeeper and her
15-year-old daughter.
   About 75 people attended a candlelight vigil outside Boston's
John F. Kennedy federal building Friday and memorial services were
held at Boston College and the Cathedral of St. Paul for the dead
priests and the 74,000 other Salvadorans who have died in 10 years
of civil war.
   ``Of course, events in the Persian Gulf have been on the front
burner,'' said U.S. Rep. Joseph Moakley, who heads a congressional
inquiry into the murders. ``After a year, it's almost amazing that
the public is still focusing on the atrocities in El Salvador.''
   Moakley said the priests' murders have drawn that attention.
   ``The Jesuit community and others have kept a focus on these
heinous crimes,'' he said.
   Neighbor to Neighbor renewed appeals for a boycott of Folger's
and other U.S. coffee brands that use Salvadoran beans. Boston's
City Council endorsed the boycott and Mayor Raymond L. Flynn banned
the brands from city offices.
   ``Our feeble and failed El Salvador policy is one tragic remnant
of a cold war which has ended virtually everywhere else,'' Flynn
said. ``It is time to end, not merely reduce, military aid to El
Salvador.''
   Procter &amp; Gamble said in a statement that a boycott only hurts
the people of El Salvador, and the company provided letters from
the U.S government urging it to continue buying Salvadoran beans.
   About 400 people took part in the Los Angeles rally. Among those
cited by police and later released was David Clennon of the
television show ``thirtysomething,'' said Mary Brent Wehrli, a
protest organizer.
   No violence or injuries were reported.
   The City Council proclaimed Friday a day of special remembrance
to commemorate the killings of what were termed ``martyrs for the
cause of human rights.''

<HEAD>CIA Employees Reported Fired in Stamp Case</HEAD>

   The Central Intelligence Agency has fired four
employees in an investigation of the sale of valuable mistakenly
printed postage stamps, the agency said Friday night.
   Five other other employees were disciplined in unspecified ways.
   The case arose when the CIA purchased 95 of the $1 stamps at the
McLean, Va. post office for its own use in 1986.
   The stamps showed an oil lamp, but the ones bought by the CIA
had the body of the lamp upside down. Such misprints can be
extremely valuable to stamp collectors.
   The nine employees sold 85 of the misprints to a New Jersey
dealer, giving the dealer one torn stamp. Each employee kept one
stamp, now worth a reported $17,000 each, and one of the nine
employees is believed to have lost his stamp.
   The four employees who were dismissed were fired for lying to
investigators, misappropriating government property and ``failing
to return a number of valuable stamps purchased with agency funds
after they were directed to do so,'' said spokesman Mark Mansfield.
   The dismissals were ordered ``reluctantly, only after all
alternatives were fully explored, and this resolves the case from
our point of view,'' he said.
   Mansfield quoted CIA Director William Webster as saying in an
internal statement: ``This case is important to every employee in
the agency because it gives a clearer picture of what is expected
of us. Public service is a special trust. It is not easy; it is not
without temptations.''
   The Washington Post first disclosed the firings in Saturday
editions. The newspaper said the CIA discussed the case after the
Smithsonian Institution announced it had received four stamps as a
donation from the CIA.
   Those stamps had been given back by the disciplined employees.
   None of the nine employees has been identified.
   Only one sheet of 400 stamps was believed misprinted, and the
other 305 stamps apparently were used to mail letters and packages.

   An American who said he disguised himself
as an Arab and made a seven-day, 700-mile escape across the desert
from Kuwait returned home Friday to a tearful welcome from his
family.
   Ernest Briskey, assistant vice president for international
program development at Oregon State University, spent 110 days in
hiding in Kuwait City before making his way to Amman, Jordan, on
Tuesday.
   Briskey, a food technology expert and former dean of agriculture
at Oregon State, was working as a senior adviser to the Kuwaiti
Institute of Scientific Research when Iraqi forces invaded the
country on Aug. 2.
   His wife, three children and 4-year-old granddaughter welcomed
him on his arrival at Portland International Airport.
   He declined to talk about the specifics of his escape because of
fear of reprisal for those who helped him. Those who gave him aid
during his time in hiding and as he escaped would be executed if
they were caught, he said.
   Briskey, 59, spoke about the damage done in Kuwait by the Iraqi
army.
   ``It's been an incredibly brutal destruction of a people and a
country, actually much worse than what has been portrayed perhaps
to the American people,'' he said.
   Briskey said the Iraqis were removing everything of value from
Kuwait.
   ``They brought trucks down,'' he said. ``They took dairy cows,
all the chickens, all the computers, all the cars. They took
anything moveable, hospital supplies.''
   Briskey said he heard many tales of brutality.
   ``I personally know that they did shoot members of families if
they found anything American,'' Briskey said. ``I know people who
saw this happen. They shot people including a 70-year-old
grandfather because a passport was found.''
   Briksey said he lived in four different places while in hiding,
and there were many times he nearly was captured.
   ``I spent time under bushes outside the house, under air
conditioners and under water tanks while searches were being
threatened,'' Briskey said. ``One time I could count 200 soldiers
and more than a half a dozen tanks outside my window.''
   Asked how he spent his time, Briskey said, ``I listened to the
BBC every hour on the hour and I read a lot. I read the Bible
twice.''
   He said he supports President Bush's actions in the region and
only wishes the buildup of forces had come sooner. He hopes war can
be avoided but said he saw no signs that Saddam Hussein is willing
to withdraw Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
   ``Kuwait is not Kuwait anymore,'' he said. ``It is all bunkered.
Ridges are built out of sand with machine guns and all the barbed
wire and the mines.''

<HEAD>Bush an `Inept' Communicator on Gulf Crisis: Lawmaker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush acknowledges he may not have
explained his goals in the Persian Gulf standoff clearly enough to
reassure the American public, and one congressional backer of his
gulf policy strongly agrees.
   ``President Bush has proven to be an inept communicator and has
failed to convey to the public why we are in Saudi Arabia,'' Rep.
Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said
Thursday.
   Aspin, D-Wis., said he believes that hearings planned by
congressional committees, including his own, will provide
sufficient debate on the critical issue.
   Bush, in an interview Thursday with Cable News Network, pledged
not to involve the country in a ``drawn-out Vietnam'' situation. He
said he probably has not communicated very well his objectives in
the gulf standoff against Iraq.
   ``If I haven't done as clear a job as I might on explaining
this, then I've got to do better in that regard, because I know in
my heart of hearts that what we are doing is right,'' the president
said.
   Recent congressional criticism of Bush's decision to send
200,000 U.S. troops to join the 230,000 already in the gulf region
reveals the absence of a consensus, said Aspin, who supports Bush's
policy.
   ``We need a consensus on the issue of whether the embargo works
and when you use military force to enforce the embargo,'' he told
reporters.
   Aspin also released an interim report card on U.S. allies and
other nations based on their aid to the gulf effort.
   The lawmaker gave Turkey and Egypt ``A-plus'' for their prompt
response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Turkey was
cited for shutting down the oil pipeline from Iraq that runs
through Turkey to the Mediterranean Sea.
   Egypt sent 2,000 troops to Saudi Arabia shortly after the
invasion and committed 30,000 additional ground troops.
   Saudi Arabia received a ``B'' from Aspin for a financial
contribution that fails to match the profits it will earn due to
higher oil prices and increased Saudi oil production.
   The Pentagon says the gulf states have contributed $6 billion so
far. Aspin gave Japan a ``C'' for its plan to provide $2 billion
through March 1991; Germany received a ``C,'' while other European
nations were given a ``C-minus.''
   ``This is not meant to trivialize an important issue, but rather
to summarize and give greater clarity to an analysis that is
necessarily nuanced and intricate,'' said Aspin.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a senior member of the House
Armed Services Committee, expressed concern that front-line Arab
states were not doing their part in providing forces.
   ``The United States should be reducing the number of U.S. troops
and telling the Saudis and other states of the Gulf Cooperation
Council to provide the primary military force,'' she said.
   In other gulf-related developments:
   -Iraqi President Saddam Hussein told ABC News he was holding
hostages because their presence ``may help distract anybody who may
opt for war.'' Saddam called on Bush to pledge not to attack Iraq,
and added, ``An open pledge of this nature, a declared statement of
this nature, would be sufficient for us to allow all foreigners to
leave Iraq.'' He also said he needs nuclear weapons to balance
weapons he contended Israel possesses.
   -Bush invoked emergency powers authorizing the Pentagon to begin
military construction projects in the gulf region without advance
approval from Congress. Otherwise, the Pentagon would have had to
go through a long process of seeking authorization and financing
from Congress.
   -The House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee said it
will hold hearings on the economic impact of U.S. involvement in
the Middle East on Nov. 27-28.
   -The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement signed
by 45 national organizations calling on Bush to promise not to
order a military attack against Iraq without congressional
authorization.
   -The State Department said more than 100 Americans and their
foreign-born family members are expected to leave Kuwait on Sunday
aboard a U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways flight. Most are women and
children who had been eligible to leave for some time but decided
only recently to do so, a spokesman said.

   The Bush administration, scrambling to regain
the upper hand in the tax debate, is studying a proposal to cut
Social Security and other benefits paid to affluent Americans and
funnel the savings to the poor and middle class.
   While an effort to trim such popular benefit programs as Social
Security, Medicare and farm subsidies would be certain to provoke a
firestorm of protest, a White House official said Thursday the idea
was being ``contemplated very seriously.''
   Under the proposal being reviewed, the savings obtained by
trimming payments for well-to-do recipients would be used to
provide tax cuts for less-affluent taxpayers.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stressed that
the benefit-cut proposal was at a very preliminary stage of review
as the administration begins work on its fiscal 1992 budget, to be
submitted to Congress in February.
   The proposal would offer the tempting political benefit of
allowing the administration to trim government spending and cut
taxes while at the same time blunting Democratic charges that the
Republican White House favors the rich.
   In the past, the administration and Congress have shied away
from trying to reduce the budget by trimming popular government
benefits.
   The benefit cuts are receiving a new look because the
administration believes last month's deficit-reduction agreement
gives it new leverage, the White House source said.
   That agreement, which calls for $500 billion in savings over
five years, has a new pay-as-you-go mechanism that will trigger
automatic benefit cuts unless Congress reduces benefits in line
with any tax reductions it approves.
   Thus, the administration could be assured that if it links
benefit cuts and tax cuts in its budget, Congress won't be tempted
to pass the politically popular tax reductions while simply
ignoring the recommended benefit reductions.
   The benefit-cut plan was first disclosed by The Wall Street
Journal.
   White House budget director Richard Darman has said he believes
the new deficit-enforcement mechanism will shift the debate from
one simply over how much to spend to one over where the spending
offers the best return.
   As part of the budget-drafting exercise, President Bush has held
a series of meetings in the past week with his advisers and top
business executives to help gauge whether the economy is in a
recession and what the appropriate government response should be.
   Reflecting on the meetings, Bush offered his gloomiest
assessment to date of the country's economic prospects, saying, ``I
am concerned that we are in a downturn here.''
   In an interview broadcast Thursday night by CNN, the president
noted that the technical definition of a recession as two
consecutive quarters of declining economic output had not yet been
met. But he did not rule out the possibility that the nation was on
the verge of having two negative quarters.
   ``I'm not an economist, but most seem to feel that if we have a
recession that meets these technical terms, that it will not be
deep and that we'll come out of it relatively soon - six months at
most,'' Bush said.
   A group of top bankers and industrialists who met with Bush on
Thursday gave him a generally pessimistic view of the economy's
prospects, according to one participant.
   Jhn G. Medlin Jr., president and chief executive officer of
First Wachovia Corp., a leading bank holding company, said the
general view among the business leaders was ``that we may have
slipped into a recession.''
   The administration has said it wants to include as part of its
1992 budget pro-growth measures aimed at lessening the impact of
any downturn.
   Medlin said the president did not mention any specific measures
under consideration. Administration officials have suggested,
however, that Bush may try again to cut the tax rate on capital
gains, the profits made on the sale of real estate, stocks and
other assets.

   The shower of letters, packages
and banners for the U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf region is a far
cry from the sendoff Joe Mobley got the last time he was in a war
zone.
   In 1968, he sailed aboard the USS Enterprise from San Francisco
to Vietnam, where he would be held for four and a half years as a
prisoner of war in America's longest and most unpopular conflict.
   ``There were people throwing garbage at us from the Golden Gate
Bridge,'' said Mobley, 46, now captain of the carrier USS Saratoga
operating in the Red Sea.
   In Operation Desert Shield, Americans at home are throwing
bouquets in the form of 70 tons of mail every day.
   It may be putting a big strain on the military's mail service,
but for the 230,000 U.S. service personnel deployed in the gulf
region, it's a big morale booster.
   ``All military men like to feel the citizens are behind them. It
makes the job a lot easier,'' Mobley said. ``That's a stark
contrast to what most of us felt in Vietnam.''
   Public support is as important as it is fickle. When public
opinion turned against the Vietnam War a generation ago, campus
demonstrations and civil riots turned into outright indignation
against the military.
   For now, the giant greetings cards and banners from school
children, church groups and well-wishers help troops endure the
harsh Saudi sands.
   The Rural Retreat Elementary School in Wytheville, Va., for
example, has adopted members of a platoon in the Army's 82nd
Airborne Division. The principal, a Vietnam vet, is the father of
Pfc. Jimmy Phipps, 20, a machine gunner with the 82nd.
   ``If you don't have people that care and you don't have people
behind you, you ain't got nothing,'' Phipps said during a break
from training.
   ``These guys live off mail. It's like their blood,'' said Capt.
Clint Esarey, 31, of Fort Lewis, Wash.
   Mail from family, friends and loved ones is one thing. Sacks of
letters, care packages and chocolate bars from strangers is
something else.
   ``We've received countless pieces of mail from people we don't
know, have never heard of,'' said Marine Cpl. Christopher
Francovich, 23, of San Francisco.
   ``Everytime I read them I get goose pimples. It touches us. It
makes this little event here worth it for us. I'd like to thank the
folks back home,'' Francovich said.
   A hangar at an airfield in eastern Saudi Arabia is adorned with
a giant white sheet trimmed with a yellow ribbon from an elementary
school in Toms River, N.J. It has peace signs and Bart Simpson
faces on it.
   One note reads: ``I strongly suggest when you come back, party
hearty. Marty.''
   Another signed by Michael Tsambikou says: ``Kick some butt.
Win!''
   In the same hangar are three giant cards collected from a
shopping mall in Burlington, N.J., and a giant postcard from
Delaware.
   ``I just want you to know all of Delaware is backing you and
hoping for your safe return. When you're sweating and eating less
than delicious food, just remember that when you return, you can
eat all the wonderful food you can stuff in your bellies,'' wrote
Laurie Wheeler.
   ``It's important to know you're not forgotten, that somebody
cares,'' said Lt. Kim Thompson, the female leader of a military
police platoon in the 197th Infantry Brigade.
   One package addressed to ``any Jewish soldier'' contained a
Hanukkah kit, which would be impossible to get in a country that
recognizes Islam as the only religion.
   ``Keep it coming. It boosts the morale of every soldier out
here,'' said Staff Sgt. Joseph Herald, 34, of Olympia, Wash.
   Most soldiers have only a cursory knowledge of the domestic
debate about whether or not American troops should be deployed in
the desert to counter Iraq's aggression after its Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait.
   But they agree with those who say there should be popular
support for their sacrifices or there's no point in being in Saudi
Arabia.
   ``The last thing we need is to have a war over there, a bloody
war, and have American boys being brought back in body bags and yet
not have the American people behind them,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, a
Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   ``We've gone that route one time. We don't need to do it
again,'' Nunn said.
   Those memories are alive in the minds of old hands and fresh
faces alike.
   ``It's almost overwhelming the support we've gotten from back
home. That's something we didn't get in Vietnam,'' said Col. Glynn
Hale, a brigade commander in the 82nd Airborne who served three
tours in Vietnam.
   ``It never really struck me until we started getting all the
letters and cards over here. It's quite a change. These guys know
they're being appreciated over here,'' Hale said.
   Marine Cpl. Carlin Walters, 21, of Vidor, Texas, remembers too.
   ``In the back of our minds, we don't want to be treated like
they were in Vietnam,'' he said. ``If I come home from this and and
people decide to spit on me, ain't no telling what I'll do.''

   Thousands of people are flocking to a Greek
Orthodox church to see an icon that they believe began shedding
tears last month after a special prayer session for peace in the
Middle East.
   The icon of St. Irene, patron saint of peace, has drawn
Christians of many denominations and smaller numbers of Moslems,
Jews and the curious to the St. Irene Chrysovalantou Cathedral,
church officials say.
   Visitors have come from as far away as France, Japan and India,
according to Maria Galiatsatos, assistant secretary at the church
in a largely Greek Astoria neighborhood in the Queens borough.
   She said she receives up to 500 phone calls a day.
   ``We have had more than 100,000 people visit here since she
began crying,'' Galiatsatos said. ``One Sunday we didn't close the
church until 4 a.m., and we reopened at 6 o'clock in the morning.''
   The church's Bishop Vikentios of Avlon says he believes the icon
of St. Irene - whose name means ``peace'' in Greek - is weeping for
the Persian Gulf.
   ``The Gulf crisis is very serious at this moment. ... Something
will happen and we have sent a message of peace to Mikhail
Gorbachev, the secretary-general of the United Nations and
President George Bush,'' the cleric said.
   Worshipers believe the icon, painted in Greece in 1919 and
brought here two decades ago, began crying Oct. 17 after it was
taken to a sister church in Chicago for a special service for world
peace.
   ``At 7 o'clock in the evening, after the prayer service - in
which we had about 1,000 people praying for peace, especially in
the Persian Gulf - several people came running to us. They said
`Come look, the icon is crying,' and we came upstairs and we saw
the tears and everyone started crying ....
   ``This was it, a message to the world, that it must continue to
pray for peace.''
   After the icon was brought back from Chicago, word of the
``weeping saint'' spread quickly in the neighborhood.
   The painting, a portrait of a dour-faced woman cloaked in black,
is encased behind glass on a carved oak stand set up before the
altar of the darkened church.
   People file past to the sounds of mournful Greek chants. A
figure in a black hood beckons them one at a time, lighting a taper
to illuminate the painting.
   At first, the flame reveals little. But then the light seizes on
the face of St. Irene, where glistening streaks can be seen
extending from each eye down the cheeks.
   ``Kiss the icon,'' the robed figure intones before the visitor
steps away.
   The church has ruled out taking the icon from the church for
scientific tests, but invites skeptics to examine the painting and
even take some ``tears'' for laboratory analysis.
   C.J. Peterson, 67, dropped by after hearing about the icon from
fellow worshipers at a Baptist church. ``To me, it seemed real. It
looks like tears. It looked real. It looked wet,'' he said.
   Bishop Vikentios said he is pained by the picture.
   ``We're sad, we're so sad. We don't want to see the icon crying.
I've been here for 20 years and she has always been happy,'' he
said.

   Three of the ``Keating Five'' senators were
deeply involved in helping financier Charles H. Keating Jr.
strong-arm federal banking regulators, and in some cases discussed
money and favors at the same time, the Senate ethics counsel says.
   Democratic Sens. Alan Cranston, Dennis DeConcini and Donald
Riegle played the largest roles in helping Charles H. Keating Jr.
seek waivers of federal rules limiting risky savings and loan
investments, the Senate Ethics Committee's lawyer said as the panel
opened hearings Thursday.
   Special counsel Robert S. Bennett - who concludes his summation
of evidence today - assigned lesser roles to Sens. John McCain,
R-Ariz., and John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   ``While Senator Cranston and DeConcini were by far the most
active on Mr. Keating's behalf, the evidence shows Senator Riegle
played an important role in the early stages,'' Bennett said.
   ``On the other hand, it is to be said for Senator Riegle that
like Senators Glenn and McCain, his efforts on behalf of Lincoln
appear to have ended as of April 9, 1987.''
   On that date, the five lawmakers were told by federal officials
that criminal referrals involving Keating's Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association would be made to the Justice Department.
   Cranston, of California, was the only one of the five senators
who did not attend Thursday. He begins radiation treatment for
prostate cancer next week and, after today's session, may miss much
of the proceedings.
   The five senators are accused of improperly intervening with
federal banking regulators on Keating's behalf. Riegle, of
Michigan, is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. DeConcini is
from Arizona.
   Keating and his associates contributed more than $1.3 million to
the senators' campaigns or favored causes. His California-based
S&amp;L's collapse may cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion. Keating is
free on bail while facing fraud charges in California.
   Bennett said there was no disputing that each senator tried to
help Keating in some way.
   But he said the question of whether they exerted improper
influence arises partly from the campaign finance system that
increasingly requires members of Congress to seek financial
contributions.
   ``It is a booming warning,'' Bennett said. ``Unless the trends
are recognized and dealt with, we will have more cases like this
and the reputation of this body and its members will be in utter
ruin.''
   Bennett said Cranston continued contacting federal regulators on
Keating's behalf after being told that criminal complaints about
Lincoln would be referred to the Justice Department. He said
Cranston's efforts continued even after former Arizona Gov. Bruce
Babbitt told him Keating was ``a crook.''
   Cranston received the most money from Keating, including
$850,000 to three voter registration projects he backed. Bennett
said Cranston, a liberal Democrat, should have questioned why a
conservative such as Keating would give money to causes that
probably would lead to more black and Hispanic voters.
   ``I will give you many instances where acts and money were
discussed at the same time and hundreds of thousands of dollars, in
the case of Senator Cranston, passed in an office in this
building,'' Bennett said.
   Evidence shows DeConcini offered a deal on Keating's behalf to
top thrift regulator Edwin Gray, Bennett said. DeConcini has denied
such a quid pro quo was offered.
   The counsel said Riegle ``set into motion'' plans for Gray's
meeting with other senators, and hid from his own aides his role in
arranging that meeting.
   Campaign contributions by Keating and associates to Riegle came
just weeks before that meeting, Bennett said. He disputed Riegle's
claim that he did not know that a fund-raising visit to Keating's
Phoenix-based company, American Continental Corp., was scheduled on
a trip he took to Arizona within days of the Gray meeting.
   Bennett said Glenn arranged and attended a luncheon involving
Keating and then-House Speaker Jim Wright in January 1988 to
discuss S&amp;L problems. But the counsel said he found no evidence
linking Glenn's actions to Keating's contributions.
   McCain had been a friend of Keating; his family had vacationed
at Keating's resort home and flew on Keating company planes,
Bennett noted. But he added there appeared to be nothing improper
in McCain's conduct.

   Jennifer Williams caught a glimpse of her father on the news and
was shocked to see his hair had gone white in the months since her
father and stepmother became trapped in Iraq by the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   ``This whole hostage situation has taken a toll on everyone in
this family,'' said Ms. Williams, a senior at Southern Methodist
University in Dallas. ``So I'm going over there to do whatever I
can to get them out.''
   Ms. Williams, 21, is among a growing group of Americans who have
decided to accept Saddam Hussein's invitation to spend the holidays
with loved ones stranded in Iraq.
   ``I know that Saddam doesn't care about Christmas. This is all
about the media,'' Ms. Williams said. ``Still, I have to do what I
can to try and negotiate them out.''
   Stewart and Charlene Williams, who work in the banking industry,
became ``human shields'' after Iraqi troops overran Kuwait on Aug.
2. Foreign women and children were subsequently freed, but
Charlene, 45, stayed behind.
   Now, Jennifer Williams feels it's her turn to take a stand.
   But Jerry Waters, a spokesman for the State Department's Kuwaiti
Task Force, said the U.S. government was advising families against
such expeditions.
   ``While our hearts go out to these families, our advice remains
the same: Travel to Iraq is dangerous and we cannot guarantee the
safety of those who decide to go,'' said Waters, who could not say
how many inquiries the task force had received.
   John Stevenson's siblings already have made their travel
arrangements. The hostage's twin sister and two brothers don't care
what the government recommends.
   ``We have one priority: to see our brother,'' Bill Stevenson,
acting as family spokesman, said from Brockton, Mass. ``We're not
going to a zoo to view animals held in cages. We're going to get
our brother and bring him home.''
   Relatives of the estimated 1,000 Americans held in Kuwait and
Iraq can imagine heroic scenarios in which their personal pleas to
Saddam secure a loved one's freedom.
   But the reality, some families said, could play out very
differently.
   ``I spoke to Guy,'' said Betty Seago, whose husband was among
hostages allowed to telephone home recently. ``And he said he
didn't have good feelings about (Saddam's invitation) but would
leave it up to me.''
   Mrs. Seago said she had no plans to visit her husband, an oil
worker, ``even though I know he wants to see me.'' She said her
family in Johnson City, Tenn., felt such a trip would be too risky.
   Kim Edwards, 34, of Carson City, Nev., chose to ignore the risk
and made a trip to visit her husband, Tony, in Baghdad. She arrived
safely back in the United States last week and is planning a return
visit in December.
   ``The trips are necessary because somebody has to do
something,'' Mrs. Edwards said. ``We all feel that our hands are
tied. The United States isn't making any sort of diplomatic move
toward a peaceful resolution.''
   President Bush's decision last week to deploy up to 200,000 more
servicemen in the Persian Gulf has stirred fear among many of those
with stranded loved ones who could die if war breaks out.
   ``I'm morally opposed to war,'' Jennifer Williams said Wednesday
from Dallas. ``And I'm opposed to my father and stepmother dying
for oil. That's why I'm going over there - to try negotiations.''
   Vafa Fouroohi said he doesn't see much room for negotiation,
though his younger brother has secured a visa and plans to visit
their father in Baghdad.
   ``I think this is propaganda,'' said Fouroohi, who is managing
the family business in Redmond, Wash. His father, Fred Harrington,
was taken hostage while visiting Kuwait on business.
   ``Saddam Hussein is perhaps creating a little good
advertising,'' said Fouroohi, whose father changed his name after
emigrating to America. ``But I'm not going to go in for it. I have
responsibilities here for the well-being of my family.''

<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The PLO says it won't block President Elias
Hrawi's efforts to end 15{ years of civil war, but its thousands of
guerrillas in south Lebanon are a wild card that Saddam Hussein
could play.
   The Iraqi president might try to use the PLO to thwart the plans
of Syria, his archrival and Hrawi's main backer.
   Yasser Arafat's PLO, which has supported Saddam, has at least
5,000 hardcore guerrillas and thousands more reservists around the
southern port of Sidon, an area that neither Syria nor the Lebanese
government controls.
   Not only is the PLO strong, but the Shiite Moslem Amal and
Hezbollah factions are also regrouping there along with pro-Syrian
guerrilla groups. The Israelis occupy a border strip and show no
sign of leaving.
   Hrawi, aided by Syria's military muscle, has persuaded Lebanon's
main militias to withdraw from Beirut in the first phase of a peace
plan to demilitarize the capital and, on paper at least, eventually
the whole country.
   The plan, ratified by Parliament last fall, made no specific
reference to the Palestinians. But Hrawi has said they would have
to disarm as well.
   ``The Palestinians' weapons will be removed and the Palestinian
refugees ... will be placed under the protection of the government
and legal authorities,'' he said.
   ``We're prepared to help the government spread its authority
over the whole of Lebanon, including our refugee camps. Let them
talk to us, and an agreement on this can be worked out,'' Saadallah
Qott, the PLO's political chief in south Lebanon, told The
Associated Press.
   Col. Anwar Mady, the PLO commander in the Sidon region, said:
``Let President Hrawi talk to his counterpart, the President of
Palestine (Arafat), about what he wants from the Palestinian forces
in Lebanon and I'm sure whatever the Lebanese government wants from
us can be worked out.''
   Qott, interviewed at his office in the el-Bus refugee camp near
Tyre, said: ``Arab League resolutions state that Palestinians
should have a regular brigade of the Palestine Liberation Army in
each Arab country that hosts them.''
   ``Our forces in Lebanon can make up a regular PLA brigade, and
we're prepared to place it at the disposal of the Lebanese under
the direct command of the army,'' he said.
   But the offer is clouded by many questions.
   Arafat is not in a strong bargaining position right now. He's
already being squeezed by Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, who have
allied against Saddam over his Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. The last
thing Arafat needs now is pressure on him in south Lebanon.
   But security sources say that Syria, which has been at odds with
the PLO since 1983, will not allow Hrawi to cut a deal with the
Palestinians that would give the PLO any legitimacy in Lebanon.
   That leaves Hrawi in an awkward position. He does not have the
military strength himself to reestablish government control in the
south. With its 40,000 troops in Lebanon, Syria is the main
powerbroker, but it is wary of provoking the Israelis by doing
Hrawi's work for him.
   Charles Snow, a veteran regional analyst, wrote in the Middle
East Economic Survey this week that getting the militias out of
Beirut ``is likely to be child's play compared to disarming them,
and even if the militias are somehow persuaded or coerced into
handing over their weapons, still larger obstacles loom on the
horizon.
   ``One of them is the status of the Palestinians in south Lebanon
and their relations with the government.''
   South Lebanon was once virtually run by the Palestinians, who
used it as a base for attacks on Israel. The Palestinians' creation
of a state-within-a-state and the threat it posed to the
Christian-dominated government was a key factor behind the outbreak
of civil war in 1975.
   The Christians cooperated with the Israelis when they invaded
Lebanon in 1982 and drove the PLO out of the south and Beirut.
   But when the Christians allied themselves with Iraq in 1988,
they helped Arafat's guerrillas infiltrate back into Lebanon
because the PLO fighters opposed the Syrians.
   Hrawi's long-term aim is the removal of foreign forces in
Lebanon, including the Palestinians.
   But the Syrians have made it clear they will not withdraw until
Israel pulls out of the zone in south Lebanon it has occupied since
mid-1985, when most of its invasion army withdrew.

<HEAD>CNN Asking High Court to Allow it to Air Telephone Tapes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable News Network is asking the Supreme Court
to let it broadcast tape recordings of deposed Panamanian leader
Manuel Noriega's telephone conversations with his lawyers from his
Florida jail cell.
   The justices today were awaiting responses from Noriega and the
Bush administration to the emergency CNN request and are unlikely
to act on the matter before next week.
   Meanwhile, the FBI said Thursday it had obtained CNN tapes in
Atlanta and was checking whether they were recordings of Noriega.
CNN protested that the tapes were obtained without a warrant and
demanded they be returned.
   The network said the material was taken from a room that been
occupied by one of its reporters at the Omni Hotel, part of a
complex that also houses CNN's offices. A security firm had
notified FBI agents about the box of materials, CNN said.
   CNN's lawyers on Thursday asked Justice Anthony M. Kennedy to
set aside a federal judge's order banning the broadcasts. Kennedy,
who handles such emergency matters from Florida, promptly referred
the case to the full court.
   Lawyers for Noriega and the administration were urged to reply
to the network's arguments by noon Saturday.
   The justices could act on the matter over the weekend but may
decide to take some more time to study it.
   ``CNN has been restrained indefinitely from telecasting news of
great importance to the public,'' lawyers for the network said.
``Balanced against this irreparable harm to the First Amendment,
CNN and the public are speculative threats to interests that can be
otherwise protected.''
   CNN is challenging an order issued by U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler in Miami on Nov. 8 that bars CNN from broadcasting
at least some portions of the seven tapes until Hoeveler can
determine whether the broadcasts would endanger Noriega's right to
a fair trial.
   CNN refused to hand over the tapes to Hoeveler but did agree not
to broadcast tapes of Noriega talking to his lawyers until
receiving some word from the Supreme Court.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender shortly after the U.S.
invasion of Panama last December.
   Federal prison officials say inmates' telephone conversations
routinely are monitored, except when the prisoners state that they
are talking to their lawyers.
   In addition to the emergency request, CNN's lawyers filed a
formal appeal with the full Supreme Court that seeks to have the
justices declare Hoeveler's order an unconstitutional prior
restraint on free speech.
   The network's lawyers said Noriega's rights to a fair trial have
been jeopardized by the government's taping of his conversations,
not by any CNN action.
   ``Gagging CNN will neither cure nor avoid any breach by the
prosecution,'' the lawyers said. ``It will serve only to punish a
news medium which has faithfully executed its constitutional role
by reporting on criminal proceedings and allegations of unlawful
government action.''
   A series of Supreme Court decisions has greatly limited judges'
power to issue such ``gag orders'' to safeguard fair trial rights.
   In a 1976 decision, the court unanimously struck down an order
issued against the news media by a judge presiding over a Nebraska
murder case.
   In that case, the court said such prior restraints may be used
only as a last resort and that judges always must first consider
less-drastic measures.

   Supporters of Israel are increasingly anxious
that the Bush administration has relegated its veteran ally to the
sidelines of the Persian Gulf crisis to please its newfound Arab
friends allied against Iraq.
   As the standoff wears on, Israeli officials have complained
about a lack of military cooperation with the United States and
have made veiled threats that Israel will not be left a sitting
duck for Iraq's missiles.
   Publicly, U.S. and Israeli officials dismiss suggestions of an
Israeli pre-emptive strike, and both governments agree there's
nothing to be gained by Israel taking on Iraq. But privately, many
concede the two countries' priorities in the crisis differ
substantially.
   Israel's main aim is to crush Saddam Hussein's military machine,
especially the air force and missile arsenals that he has
threatened to use to launch chemical weapons and wipe out the
Jewish state.
   U.S. goals are less clear. Publicly, the administration has
defined its goals as quashing Saddam's aggression, defending the
region's vast oil reserves, removing all Iraqi forces from Kuwait
and restoring that country's government. Privately, U.S. officials
add another target: destroying Saddam's most lethal weapons.
   But Israel's supporters are worried that international pressure
and an eventual compromise with Iraq will force the United States
to abandon the last goal.
   ``They'll go home and we'll be left facing those missiles,''
said one Israeli official in Washington who asked not to be
identified.
   Israel's supporters also worry that in the aftermath of the
crisis, the Arab states that lined up with the United States
against Iraq will demand payment in the form of pressure on Israel
to give up lands it captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Mideast war.
   President Bush fueled this fear several weeks ago when he
suggested at the United Nations General Assembly that once the
crisis is over, solutions must be found to the region's other
problems. Although he insisted later that he was not hinting at any
link between the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Israel's occupation
of Arab lands, Israel supporters were not appeased.
   A handful of meetings between Bush and leaders of the Jewish
community in recent weeks have not set their minds at rest, either.
   ``We believe you don't sacrifice long-term interests for the
sake of short-term needs,'' said Malcolm Hoenline, executive
director of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish
Organizations.
   Bush assured representatives of the group, which is the umbrella
for top American Jewish leaders, that the United States remains
committed to its special relationship with Israel.
   At the meeting, Bush refused to promise he would veto a proposed
anti-Israel resolution at the United Nations. His administration
has supported two resolutions condemning Israel for the Oct. 8
killings of 20 Palestinians in a Jerusalem riot, breaking with the
inviolate past practice of supporting Israel at the world body.
   ``I don't think the relationship has changed so much. What you
don't see now is the public embrace,'' said one U.S. official.
   The sense of growing acrimony has caused both sides to back down
a bit in recent days. Israel has agreed to accept a United Nations
fact-finding mission urged on it by the United States and other
United Nations members. And U.S. officials have increased military
cooperation with Israel, officials said. They declined to discuss
the nature of this cooperation.
   In addition, quiet efforts are under way to arrange a White
House audience for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir next month
when he comes to the United States on a private visit.
   Bush and Shamir have a strained personal relationship, born of
poor chemistry and ideological disagreements, and officials on both
sides would like to improve the atmosphere between the two men.
   But the basic feeling that Israel has been demoted in its
alliance with the United States is pervasive among supporters of
the Jewish state.
   ``What he has in mind is a no-profile role, rather than a
low-profile one. Bush has decided Israel should be a protectorate
of the United States, rather than a strategic ally,'' said Martin
Indyk, director of the Washington Institute for Near East Studies.
   The notion that Israel should leave its defense in the hands of
another country is anathema to the military doctrine of the tiny
state, surrounded by Arab enemies, which has made self-reliance a
cornerstone of its existence.
   Israel is prepared to stay out of the U.S.-Iraq confrontation as
long as it has a basic understanding with the United States that
``it's a silent partner, not a silent pariah,'' said Indyk, whose
think tank is well plugged into Israeli thinking.

<HEAD>Bennett Says Most States Doing Well in Enacting Anti-Drug Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Most states are acting ``quickly and well and
effectively'' in approving anti-drug laws, says national drug
policy director William J. Bennett, but a congressional critic says
Bennett is not the person to judge.
   Bennett on Thursday released a status report that listed which
of 18 anti-drug measures supported by the Bush administration have
been approved by each state.
   ``The chart is not a ranking of the states, and I would caution
against concluding that a state with a lot of dots on this chart is
necessarily better off than a state with a few dots,'' said
Bennett, who is resigning this month as director of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy.
   Nevertheless, the states getting the most praise from him
generally had passed the most laws.
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, chairman of the House Select Committee
on Narcotics and a frequent Bennett adversary, dismissed the
ratings.
   ``While I believe the states should be held accountable for
their drug control efforts, I do not believe it should be done by
Bill Bennett, because he has no effective federal programs to point
to,'' the New York Democrat said.
   ``Instead of trying to subtly rate states and coerce state
legislatures into adopting director Bennett's preferred state drug
policies and procedures, the drug czar should be offering technical
assistance to help states develop effective anti-drug strategies in
a cooperative atmosphere.''
   Bennett singled out nine states for praise: Texas, Florida,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Colorado, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Rhode Island
and New Jersey. All but Texas and Pennsylvania have adopted at
least 12 of the 18 anti-dru laws checked for the status report.
   But Bennett criticized California - which has passed 11 of the
18 - and New York - which has approved eight. California needs
tougher drug sentences and New York needs tougher penalties for
users, he said.
   Both states, which have decriminalized possession of small
amounts of marijuana, have major trafficking operations and drug
consumption and ``they must do more,'' he said.
   Bennett acknowledged that the laws checked may not be the best
determinant of the effectiveness of a state's war on drugs. For
example, one measure concerned whether a state has boot camps for
some drug offenders. Thirty-two states do, but two states he
praised - Pennsylvania and Rhode Island - do not.
   The measures checked included whether the state:
   -Requires eviction of drug offenders from public housing
projects.
   -Allows the seizure and forfeiture of drug traffickers' assets.
   -Has guidelines allowing private employers to conduct random
drug tests on their workers.
   -Has centers monitoring people for at least six months after
they complete drug treatment to ascertain whether the treatment
works.
   States that have adopted six or fewer of the measures are
Alaska, Arkansas, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota,
Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and Wyoming, plus the District
of Columbia.
   Those with 12 or more are Colorado, Florida, Michigan,
Minnesota, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Rhode Island. The rest had
seven to 11.
   The status report also included each state's per capita spending
on drug treatment last year.
   New York spent the most: $8 per person. Next was Connecticut,
with $4.57; Rhode Island, $3.41; Maryland, $2.43; New Jersey,
$2.35; Oregon, $2.17, and Florida, $2.07.
   Spending the least were South Dakota at 6 cents; Idaho and
Minnesota, 7 cents; Alabama, 21 cents; Maine 23 cents; and West
Virginia, 26 cents.
   In all, 23 states and the District of Columbia spent less than
$1 per resident on drug treatment last year, the report showed.

<HEAD>FDA Investigates Link Between Electric Blankets, Cancer and

<TEXT>
   Should people stop using electric blankets
because scientists suspect it may cause cancer or a miscarriage?
   Food and Drug Administration officials won't advise one way or
the other.
   But they will tell you that the studies, while still
inconsistent and inconclusive, are getting more troubling.
   Even three years ago, the FDA said there was not enough evidence
to be concerned, ``but now the evidence is not as amenable to
discounting,'' said F. Alan Andersen, an official in the agency's
Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
   On Thursday, a divided FDA advisory committee endorsed the
agency's policy that recognizes the suspicious link between
electric blankets and cancer and miscarriages but stops short of a
public warning of danger.
   ``We can't say there is no public health concern, but we can't
quantify it (the risk),'' Anderson said.
   Panel members told the FDA to continue working with industry to
make manufacturing changes to reduce the very low frequency
radiation emitted by electric blankets and to continue monitoring
scientific studies.
   Anderson describes the evidence now as showing ``a suggested
association between exposure (to low levels of electromagnetic
radiation) and the possibility of adverse health outcomes,''
including cancer and miscarriages.
   While the risk can't be quantified, it is prudent to reduce
electromagnetic emissions for electric blankets, just as the FDA
has been trying to do with video display terminals, the panel
agreed.
   ``It's too soon to regulate, but it's (also) too soon to walk
away,'' said panel member Mary E. Moore, associate radiological
physicist at Cooper Hospital University Medical Center in Camden,
N.J. ``I'm not convinced we have the data to say it's totally
safe.''
   The Advisory Committee on Technical Electronic Product Radiation
Safety Standards voted 8-3 to endorse the FDA's policy to work with
electric blanket makers on reducing the levels of radiation.
   Then, after one member left, the others split 5-5 and rejected a
motion that called for the agency to advise the public there was no
scientific evidence of a public health risk.
   Edgar B. Dally, vice president and general manager of CTI
Cyclotron Systems in Berkeley, Calif., said the evidence that
points to a possible public health hazard are ``a series of flaky
studies. You can't add up garbage and get gospel.''
   ``The whole thing is getting out of control,'' he said. ``The
possibility of mass panic is there.''
   The FDA began working with the nation's three electric blanket
manufacturers last spring to reduce the levels of magnetic fields
outside the blankets, which is relatively easy and fairly
inexpensive to do, he said. All three have cooperated and made the
electrical changes.
   However, reducing the electrical component of the
electromagnetic field is more difficult and may not even be
feasible with electric blankets because of the heavier cord that
would be required, he said.
   All appliances that are powered by alternating current emit some
electromagnetic radiation. But the FDA has focused on electric
blankets and video display terminals because these are the two
products where both the intensity and duration of exposure for
consumers generally is greatest.
   Current and future studies may show that other appliances and
devices are more more harmful, but until that is known the FDA
should be cautious, Anderson said.

   A Soviet company has signed an agreement to
assemble Ford cars for the Soviet market, the Workers Tribune
newspaper reports.
   Avtokam, a Soviet trade association, signed the agreement with
FSV International, a British company that is to deliver the Ford
parts for what is to be called the Avtokam Ranger, the newspaper
said Thursday.
   Plans call for assembly of 20,000 cars in 1991 and 150,000 per
year in the future. Up to 2,500 people may eventually work at the
plant in Mendeleyevsk, which is in the Tatar region of Russia about
560 miles east of Moscow, the newspaper said.
   Avtokam was founded by engineers who have worked in other Soviet
auto plants, including the Volga Autoworks in Togliatti. The
newspaper did not give any details on Ford's involvement or the
amount of money to be invested in the project.
   Ford officials were not immediately available for comment.

   The Soviet Union's plight as winter
approaches, and the possibility of U.S. bailout measures, show how
quickly history can alter events.
   For 45 years the two superpowers viewed each other with icy
suspicion. On Monday in Paris, they will sign a treaty that sets in
motion the largest weapons cutback ever attempted by old
adversaries.
   And in Washington, Bush administration officials are exploring
ways to help the Soviets get through the winter without
embarrassing President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the uneasy head of a
once-powerful empire now struggling not to collapse in disarray.
   The contingency planning is based more on concern that internal
disorders may escalate than on food shortages, although they are
severe, administration officials told The Associated Press
Thursday.
   ``It's a tense moment, and it's anyone's guess whether there is
going to be some out-and-out confrontation,'' an official said.
   Gorbachev is waging a difficult campaign to convert the Soviet
economy. He was encouraged by the United States and other
capitalist nations, and really had no choice.
   After more than 70 years of communism the Soviet system was
capable of ambitious space exploration programs and maintaining
powerful armed forces. But it could no longer put off it citizens'
demands for a better life.
   Gorbachev's transition to a Western-style system has produced
dislocation and hardships. Food rationing will begin next month in
Leningrad, the country's second largest city.
   Some smaller cities have lived with rationing for more than a
year.
   In Moscow, items such as sugar are restricted. The city council
is debating whether to issue coupon booklets.
   The Bush administration's estimate is that the Soviets can get
through the winter because the harvest was good and food imports
are high.
   The main problem, the officials said, is transporting the crops
to market. Spoilage in the last few months was massive.
   ``The food situation is always bad, but it may not be worse this
year,'' said an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``Our best estimate is that they are going to muddle through.''
   Soviet troops may be used to help get the food to the main
population centers.
   However, the officials said, internal unrest could send the
country into a tailspin and the potential for destabilization is
the main reason the administration is exploring ways to help out.
   The Bush administration has encouraged Gorbachev to negotiate
self-determination with the Baltic states. But apart from
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, the diverse Soviet Union also is
being pulled apart by other nationalities trying to get out from
under Kremlin control.
   And it is these strains that are contributing to Gorbachev's
plight as he pursues perestroika.
   Among the aid measures under consideration within the Bush
administration are emergency disaster relief, airlifting food and
medicine, and dispatching technicians to help iron out
transportation problems.
   There is no decision yet to go ahead, the officials stressed.
One question still being explored is whether aid can be extended
through U.S. domestic disaster relief programs. Another is whether
congressional restrictions on assistance to communist countries
pose an impenetrable barrier.
   President Bush is expected to discuss the situation with
Gorbachev during the 34-nation summit meeting in Paris next Monday
through Wednesday.
   Earlier this year Secretary of State James A. Baker III invited
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to draw up a list of
problems in the Soviet economy that U.S. technical advice might
help overcome.
   No direct food or other assistance was contemplated at the time.
   Since then, however, the situation has grown more precarious as
Gorbachev redoubles his efforts to revamp the Soviet economy and
runs into resistance from consumers and bureaucrats.
   Baker, in a major policy speech Oct. 19, warned that modernizing
in the Soviet Union had also brought fragmentation. ``Standards of
living are deteriorating,'' he said, ``shortages are spreading and
the harvest is rotting. Freedom has unleashed age-old ethnic
animosities.''
   ``We all must be understanding of the hardship a great people is
now enduring,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, in weighing whether to provide an aid package,
policy-makers in the Bush administration must consider whether the
gesture would aid or hurt Gorbachev politically.

<TEXT>
   Millions of Americans have been cheating the
government out of billions of dollars a year by claiming
non-existent children and parents as dependents for tax purposes,
the Internal Revenue Service says.
   The year after Congress required that children 5 or older have
Social Security numbers, the number of dependent exemptions dropped
by 7 million below what had been predicted. That brought in an
extra $2.8 billion in taxes in 1987 alone, the IRS says.
   Returns filed by 11,627 couples and individuals showed declines
of seven or more dependents claimed from the previous year. Nearly
67,000 claimed four, five or six fewer dependents than before. In
most cases, the exaggerated claims had been made for several years.
   ``The decrease is particularly significant because it seems to
indicate that a 20-year trend of increasing numbers of improper
dependency exemptions has finally been reversed,'' concluded IRS
researcher John A. Szilagyi.
   The study indicated that most of the cheating was being done by
single taxpayers and by married people who filed separate returns.
The number of dependents claimed by singles dropped 48.3 percent
from 1986 to 1987; claims by married people filing separately
declined 28 percent; the number claimed by couples filing joint
returns dropped 3.9 percent.
   There was not nearly so much variance when the tax returns were
divided into income groups. Those with income under $25,000 showed
a 7 percent decline in dependents claimed; between $25,000 and
$50,000, the number fell 4 percent, and those with income over
$50,000 reported 4.9 percent fewer dependents than a year before.
   Returns filed for 1987 claimed 69.7 million dependents; the IRS
had anticipated 76.7 million. These figures do not include the
personal exemptions allowed taxpayers and their spouses.
   The IRS began asking Congress as far back as 1976 for authority
to require Social Security numbers for children claimed as
dependents. But the idea was resisted for fear it would lead to a
single number by which a ``Big Brother'' federal government could
trace the finances of any citizen.
   By 1979, the number of improperly claimed dependent exemptions
had grown to 8.2 million, or 11.2 percent of those claimed, the IRS
said. But Congress would not agree to the change until it
overhauled the tax system in 1986.
   The law has been amended twice since. For returns filed in 1991,
any child 2 or older must have a Social Security number. As part of
the deficit-reduction plan enacted earlier this month, Congress
lowered the age to 1 starting with returns filed in 1992.
   The IRS is not through with those taxpayers who were found to
have exaggerated their claims for dependents over a period of
years.
   The agency checked a sampling of 838 such taxpayers whose
returns had been audited by last May and found that 89 percent of
them had been hit with tax increases averaging $2,200. About 4
percent of those cases are facing the possibility of criminal fraud
charges.

   The job took six months instead of three, but
NASA is nearly finished checking out the various systems on the
Hubble Space Telescope and is preparing its instruments for science
use.
   The ``science verification phase'' will run into next year. It
involves comparing the Hubble's pictures of stars taken above the
atmosphere with photos taken from the ground.
   That enables astronomers to adjust readings from the Hubble's
five instruments much as a motorist checks his speedometer against
highway markers and compensates for differences.
   During the orbital verification phase now nearing completion,
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration discovered that
one of the telescope's mirrors was ground to the wrong
specifications and that the spacecraft develops an annoying shudder
whenever it passes from sunlight to darkness.
   ``When we first started to plan the mission, the orbital
verification was expected to last three months,'' said Jim Elliott,
spokesman for the Goddard Space Flight Center. ``Because of the
problems with the mirror's aberration and the jitter, we haven't
been able to accomplish all we hoped to in that time.''
   J. Keith Kalinowski, head of the telescope science management
office at Goddard, said the entire calibration process had been
expected to take nine months. Instead, he said, it may take 15 to
18. The Hubble was released from the space shuttle Discovery in
April.
   Despite its problems, the Hubble has returned better images than
some of those made from the ground. Among them are the clearest
pictures yet of Pluto, the farthest planet from the sun in the
solar system, and its moon Charon.
   Hubble also photographed Saturn in more detail than has been
possible from the ground, but short of the clarity achieved by the
passing Voyager spacecraft.
   A galaxy seen only as a fuzzy ball by telescopes was found to be
so tightly packed with stars that it may harbor a black hole at its
center. The galaxy is about 40 million light years away and
contains about 30,000 stars in an area of only about nine light
years.
   ``We primarily lost the sensitivity and ability to detect very
faint objects,'' said Kalinowski. ``Roughly speaking, if I were
able to detect an object of a certain brightness at a given
distance in a given exposure time, I may now only be able to detect
the same object when it's about half as far away.''
   The instrument most hobbled by the mirror flaw is the Wide Field
Planetary Camera, which was expected to see light that originated
near the start of the universe. Current plans are to have a
visiting shuttle crew replace the camera in 1993 with one that is
fitted with corrective lenses.
   Another plan being considered would restore three other
instruments to full sensitivity, also with corrective lenses
inserted in one of the instrument bays.
   Kalinowski said a feasibility study should be completed in a
month or so and that ``it looks pretty promising.''
   Space News, an industry publication, said the ``Smartstar'' is a
$700,000 device built by the University of Wisconsin. Cost
estimates for the mission range from $20 million to $60 million or
more, according to Space News.

<TEXT>
   Supporters rang cow bells as the lone
Swiss entry in the World Solar Challenge crossed the finish line
Friday to win the 1,800-mile race.
   The solar-powered car, resembling a giant pink-and-blue
cockroach, took the lead on the first day of the competition after
leaving Darwin on Australia's north coast.
   The ``Spirit of Biel'' steadily stretched its margin on the
Stuart Highway across the country's arid Outback midsection.
   It finished at a resort south of Adelaide more than 250 miles
ahead of second-place Honda, the pre-race favorite, which was not
expected to complete the course until Saturday. The cars race only
nine hours a day.
   Three cars - Japan's Hoxan Corp. and U.S. entries University of
Michigan and Western Washington University - were battling for
third place.
   The Swiss car averaged about 38 miles per hour and finished in
an unofficial time of 46 hours and 23 minutes. That was 1{ hours
off the record set by General Motors' Sunraycer in the inaugural
race three years ago.
   The car was entered by The Bienne School Of Engineering. The
team finished third in 1987 after suffering a collision near Alice
Springs which almost put them out of the race.
   ``This proves we are not just a country of chocolate and
cheeses,'' Leo Renggli, the Swiss consul-general in Melbourne, said
as he and 200 other people met the winners.
   Biel team leader Fredy Sidler said the energy consumed by the
car over six days was equivalent to about 1{ gallons of gasoline.
   He said it gave the team a great deal of pleasure to eclipse the
performance of the giant multinational motoring companies in the
race.
   ``It's not their fault they are big and we are small, but we
proved the standard of technology we have is really at the highest
level,'' Sidler said.
   The Swiss car might have broken the record except the first day
was plagued by rain and overcast conditions that delayed the start
and slowed the field. Torential downpours later forced some teams
to cover their cars.
   The 36-team entry list included 11 cars each from Australia and
Japan, eight from the United States and one each from Canada,
Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, New Zealand and England.
   There were only three official dropouts, although a couple of
cars were reported to have traveled only 125 miles. They have five
more days to officially finish the race.
   The Stuart Highway runs through some of the world's most
desolate countryside. Temperatures regularly surpassed 100 degrees
as the cars cruised through the arid land, with no signs of
civilization for stretches of 190 miles.

   Spiraling energy prices brought on by the
turmoil in the Persian Gulf have sent inflation skyward in recent
months and now threaten to deepen the economic downturn gripping
the U.S. economy, analysts say.
   ``It's taking money out of people's pocketbooks ... They don't
have enough purchasing power'' to boost sales and keep the economy
moving, said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at
Georgia State University.
   ``It's depressing the economy,'' added Irwin Kellner, chief
economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York.
   Private analysts will have a better handle on the nation's
inflation outlook with the government's release today of the
Consumer Price Index for October.
   In advance of the Labor Department's report, many economists
were predicting a rise of between 0.6 percent and 0.7 percent in
October, or the equivalent of an annual rate of nearly 7 percent.
   That would follow the 0.8 percent jumps in consumer prices that
hit American consumers in both August and September.
   Analysts pinned both of those sharp increases squarely on
soaring energy prices that followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, and another sharp rise today would also be blamed on the
Persian Gulf standoff.
   On Thursday, President Bush called business leaders to the White
House to discuss the nation's economic problems and possible ways
to ease the pain of any economic downturn. While the administration
has stopped short of saying the nation has entered a recession,
many analysts say it has happened.
   On the inflation front, analysts say the only thing keeping the
current outbreak from worsening is the sluggishness of the U.S.
economy.
   ``Now that the economy's slowing down, that alone should cool
things off,'' said Peter Radford, chief analyst at National
Westminster Bancorp. in New York.
   ``The oil situation has not been able to ripple out through the
rest of the economy because the economy is in recession,'' said
Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover.
   An economic slowdown holds down inflation because retailers find
it hard to raise prices in the midst of a recession, analysts said.
   ``Sales are hard to get anyway, so this is not a time to be
raising your prices,'' Radford said.
   Earlier this week, the Commerce Department reported that retail
sales grew by just 0.1 percent in October, and in fact would have
declined had it not been for the increase in gasoline prices.
   Analysts said consumer prices excluding the volatile food and
energy components - or the so-called core rate of inflation -
probably increased 0.4 percent in October.
   Last week, the Labor Department reported that the Producer Price
Index for finished goods, one stop short of retail, jumped 1.1
percent in October. But the same report showed that slowing
economic growth held wholesale price growth for non-food and
non-energy items to zero.
   Analysts predicted that in coming months, inflation may start
easing a bit - if war does not break out in the gulf - because the
worst of the oil shock will be over.
   ``Oil prices appear to be stabilizing. Barring war, oil prices
probably will slow substantially'' after today's report, Ratajczak
said.

   More U.S. warships and planes will use existing
military bases in this small city-state in what may be the first of
a new type of security arrangement in Southeast Asia.
   Less costly and more flexible than massive installations like
Subic Bay and Clark Field in the Philippines, the new arrangements
could provide low-profile U.S. access to facilities without the
political complications of establishing American bases.
   Host governments would come under the U.S. military umbrella and
local economies would be buoyed by spending by the visitors.
   Washington would be able to sustain forces in the western
Pacific and Indian Ocean, reducing reliance on the Philippine
bases. Leases on the Philippine bases expire next year and talks on
their future are under way.
   The United States and Singapore said the agreement signed
Tuesday was ``concrete evidence of the determination of the United
States to retain a military presence in Southeast Asia for the
foreseeable future.''
   Under negotiation for more than a year, the accord was signed in
Tokyo by Vice President Dan Quayle and Singapore Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew. They were attending the enthronement of Emperor Akihito.
   The United States will not pay Singapore directly for increased
use of the facilities, but the presence of more U.S. servicemen is
expected to help the Singapore economy.
   Officials stress that no new bases will be built. The U.S. Air
Force is to make greater use of Paya Lebar Airport and U.S. Navy
ships will call more often at Sembawang.
   Paya Lebar, outgrown as the main civil airport, was converted to
military use in 1981. Sembawang was a Royal Navy dockyard in
British colonial days.
   Permanently assigned U.S. Navy support personnel are to increase
from 20 to about 95. An extra 75 Americans will rotate through with
each air force deployment. They will stay in existing military
housing.
   When the agreement was signed, a battle group led by the
aircraft carrier Independence was in port after a tour of duty in
the Persian Gulf.
   Air Force fighters based in South Korea held two joint exercises
named Cope Sling with Singapore's air force earlier this year.
   Before leaving Tokyo Wednesday, Quayle said talks with the
Philippines over keeping U.S. bases there were likely to conclude
on a mutually agreeable basis.
   It's ``just not the case'' that bases in Singapore will
substitute for those in the Philippines, Quayle said.
   ``This is not a substitute for that, nor do we envision any
transfer of the bases in the Philippines to Singapore,'' he said.
   But in Manila, diplomatic sources said U.S. and Philippine
negotiators appear headed for an arrangement somewhat closer to the
Singapore plan, with the United States maintaining a reduced
presence at bases that would come under Philippine control.
   Washington already has announced plans to withdraw all tactical
combat aircraft from Clark next year.
   Asian diplomats and U.S. officials say Washington has been
trying to negotiate similar access agreements in Brunei, Thailand
and Malaysia.
   A senior State Department official said in July, during the
annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting, that Brunei
already had offered access. ASEAN members include Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand.
   ``Brunei is also prepared for an enhanced security
relationship,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Bruneian officials confirmed that talks had taken place,
but would not elaborate.
   Unlike Singapore, which inherited an array of airfields,
dockyards and other military installations from the British, Brunei
has little on hand. But money is usually no object to the absolute
monarch of the oil-rich sultanate.
   Until Brunei stepped forward, Singapore was the only country in
Southeast Asia that openly backed a continued U.S. military
presence. Officials in several other capitals express private
support, but in public stress they are non-aligned.
   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said recently that his
country was willing to repair U.S. Navy ships, as well as those
from other countries, on a commercial basis and had no objection to
joint training operations.
   Indonesian armed forces spokesman Brig. Gen. Nurhadi
Purwosaputro said Wednesday that his nation does not object to the
new U.S.-Singapore agreement.
   ``As long as the agreement is limited to the use of facilities,
we are not worried about it. If the accord deals with the use of
military bases, then we object,'' Nurhadi said.
   Vietnamese officials in the late 1970s also said they provided a
facility, not a base, when the Soviet navy used installations at
Cam Ranh Bay built by the United States during the Vietnam War.
   The state-run Vietnam News Agency Sunday quoted Vietnamese
leader Nguyen Van Linh as saying U.S. ships could return to Cam
Ranh Bay if ties were normalized between Hanoi and Washington.

<HEAD>`Privatized' School Aims to Change American Public Education</HEAD>

   A new public school in a blighted
neighborhood is being turned over to a corporation that will run it
for profit, in its own unusual fashion: no grades, no desks and a
phone in every classroom.
   ``We have an opportunity to change education in America, and
we're going to use all the strength and love and energy we have to
make it happen,'' Pat Parham, principal of the still-uncompleted
South Pointe Elementary School, told an overflow crowd of about 150
teachers at a meeting last week.
   Educational Alternatives Inc., which operates private schools in
Paradise Valley, Ariz., and Eagan, Minn., plans to open South
Pointe with 550 students next fall and run it for five years. Dade
County school officials approved the plan this summer.
   EAI Director Kathryn Thomas said the school will create an
atmosphere that celebrates learning by reducing student-teacher
ratios to 12-1, tossing out multiple-choice exams and letting
students pursue personal goals at their own pace.
   South Pointe won't have desks, but it will have computers.
Classroom telephones will let students call their parents during
school hours to share their successes.
   ``What we've done is try to empower children,'' Thomas said.
``Learning becomes contagious when everybody is actively involved
in the process.''
   Some local educators expressed skepticism about such a program
in an area where about 95 percent of the families qualify for
public assistance, many students come from broken homes and drug
abuse and violence are common.
   ``I hope it's not as idealistic as it sounds. This area is
tough,'' said Lourdes Fernandez, who teaches second grade at
another local elementary school.
   But Frank Petruzielo, Dade County's associate school
superintendent, said there is no reason to believe that only
traditional educational theories work.
   ``Everybody's got an idea and an opinion on how to improve
public education,'' he said. ``This was a novel opportunity to let
people put their money where their mouth is.''
   EAI charges $4,500 tuition at its schools in Minnesota and
Arizona. South Pointe, which is being built with Dade County funds,
will get no additional public funding. That means EAI will have to
pay for extra learning materials and make its profit from the
$450,000 it hopes to raise privately.
   The school also has applied for a three-year, $230,000 Nabisco
Foundation grant to face one of its biggest challenges: encouraging
parents, many of whom speak no English and have little formal
education, to get involved.
   ``We want our parents to learn how to be parents,'' Parham said.
``We're trying to hire a person to go into the homes and train the
parents on how to work with their children.''
   EAI also hopes to recruit ``student advocates,'' including
senior citizens and people in business, to provide students with
daily encouragement.
   ``We've got to be able to respond to all their survival needs.
Without it we'll just be spinning our wheels,'' said Linda Lentin,
the lead teacher at the school.
   Jana Diconstanzo, a single mother, says she is more than willing
to give the new school a chance. She has her 5-year-old son,
Francis, enrolled in a private pre-school 45 minutes from her home
but plans to enroll him at South Pointe next year. She said other
public schools in the area are too dangerous.
   ``This is going to be a real blessing to me,'' she said. ``I
think they need something new down here.''

   The dollar gained against the yen in Tokyo Friday,
as share prices plunged again.
   The dollar closed at 129.73 yen, up 0.43 yen from Thursday's
close of 129.30 yen. After opening at 129.85 yen, trading ranged
between 129.63 yen and 129.95 yen.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
finished at 23,171.63 points, down 315.85 points or 1.34 percent
from Thursday's close at 23,487.48 points.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds was quoted at 84.82 points at 1 a.m. EST,
up from Thursday's 84.47-point finish. Their yield was lower at
7.750 percent from 7.830.
   Currency trading was ``thin and lacked direction in the absence
of major market-affecting news,'' said Noriaki Ebisui, a dealer
with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank. Spot trading totaled $6.85 billion,
down from $8.18 billion Wednesday.
   ``Unless something dramatic happens, for example the United
States cuts its interest rates substantially or war breaks out in
the (Persian) Gulf, the dollar-yen rate will stay in the current
range,'' he said.
   The dollar has been trading recently between 127 and 130 yen.
   Other dealers said many participants stayed on the sidelines
amid Britain's political uncertainties, the gulf tensions and
expectations of a possible easing in U.S. interest rates.
   Stock market traders said investors were selling shares because
of the yen's weakness against the dollar, and many stepped off to
the sidelines in the afternoon after the index's morning decline.
   ``There was little buying incentive in the market,'' said
Kazuyuki Suzuki, a trader with Daiwa Securities Co.

<HEAD>Bishops End Meeting With Worry Over Women and War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   War, women and the Bible occupied
deliberations of U.S. Roman Catholics bishops in the closing
session of their annual fall meeting.
   As the National Conference of Catholic Bishops ended its session
Thursday, the bishops' presiding officer dispatched a
hand-delivered letter to the White House telling President Bush
that offensve military action in the Middle East at this point
could violate church principles about war.
   The church leaders adopted standards for Bible readings in
worship services that would not stereotype first-century Jewish
attitudes toward Jesus and would be more inclusive of women.
   The bishops also signaled their determination to keep trying to
produce a temporarily stalled pastoral teaching letter on women's
role in the church and society.
   Bishop Joseph L. Imesch of Joliet, Ill., head of a committee
that has worked on the letter for seven years, said it still is
``alive and well.''
   The ``work continues,'' he told the gathering. ``I want to erase
any doubt about the future of the committee or the pastoral
letter.''
   Possibilities were seen for action on it next year or the year
after, but Imesch added wryly, ``If we aren't done by 1999, we all
quit.''
   Following widespread criticism that past drafts were
inconsistent in upholding equal opportunities for women, but
reaffirming their exclusion from the priesthood, action on the
letter at this meeting was put off. The Vatican suggested that
other national bishops' conferences be consulted about it.
   Imesch told reporters that ``it would be a miracle'' if the main
stumbling block - the tension between the equality principle and
church barrier to women's ordination - could be overcome.
   Asked if bishops as one of the few exclusively male
organizations left in the country felt uncomfortable in trying to
define the place of women, he said, ``There's a great deal of
uncomfortability.''
   He added much women's input has come through hearings across the
country.
   In the floor discussion, Auxiliary Bishop Francis P. Murphy of
Baltimore said the extensive discussion has ``raised consciousness
in the church and the country and thrown light on the equal or
unequal experience of women in the church and society.'''
   Meanwhile, Imesch confirmed reports that comments from the
Vatican's doctrinal congregation had accompanied the suggestion to
delay the letter, but the contents had not been released.
   Some other bishops, most of whom asked not to be identified,
said they had heard the Vatican message criticizes the letter's
defense of women's rights in regard to husbands.
   Auxiliary Bishop Thomas J. Gumbleton of Detroit said he had
heard some of it is ``so bad they don't want to see it let out.''
   In the letter to Bush, Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of
Cincinnati, the conference president, said of the Persian Gulf
crisis:
   ``We urge our government and our allies to continue to pursue
the course of peaceful pressure and not resort to war.''
   He said a military offensive now ``could well violate'' the
church's age-old ``just war'' criteria, requiring that objectives
justify the human costs, that it not target civilian areas and that
resort to it comes only after all reasonable peace efforts have
failed.
   The bishops also approved a document on observance next year of
the 500th anniversary of the coming of Europeans to America,
recognizing both good and bad results, and expressing determination
for better ways in the future.

   Imad Abu Sneineh is an Arab who no longer knows
whom to fear most. The Palestinians are after him because his
father sold property to a Jew, and now he has been knifed by a
Jewish extremist.
   ``I never believed I would be stabbed by an Israeli,'' Abu
Sneineh said Thursday as he recovered in the hospital. ``I thought
to myself tens of thousands of times that I may be stabbed by an
Arab, because my father sold his home to Ariel Sharon.''
   In fact, the house in Jerusalem's Moslem Quarter was bought by a
Jewish religious organization. Sharon, the hard-line former defense
minister, moved in after Arab attackers killed two Israelis in the
Moslem quarter December 1987.
   Jewish real estate purchases from Arabs are shrouded in secrecy,
and it is not known whether Sharon owns or rents the house.
   Abu Sneineh, 31, lives across from Sharon with his wife and two
young children but it doesn't win him any privileges. He says
police stop and search him every day.
   Israelis say Arabs sell because they get good prices. But the
leaders of the Palestinian uprising call them traitors.
   Abu Sneineh says he saw no money from the sale, but he no longer
dares to pray at the Al Aqsa mosque on Fridays, now that he has
been denounced as a collaborator in a leaflet put out by uprising
leaders.
   He says friends have turned their backs and he wishes he could
talk with Sharon.
   ``Maybe he would give us arms to protect ourselves from Arabs,''
he said.
   Sharon's spokesman could not be reached for comment.
   ``I go out in the morning and I don't believe I will return home
these days,'' he said. ``I kiss my kids as if I was going and not
coming back.''
   On Wednesday, Abu Sneineh was outside the butcher's shop where
he worked in the ultra-religious Bukhran Quarter of Jewish west
Jerusalem, waiting for his Jewish employer to close up and drive
him home.
   A religious Jew walked up and slashed him from shoulder to belly
with a knife, he said.
   ``He always came to the store, to threaten Arabs, swore at the
Arabs .. but I didn't believe he would do something like this,'' he
said. ``I thought he wanted help, to ask prices. But he took out a
knife and slashed me.''
   The employer, Mordecahi Mizrahi, tried to shield Abu Sneineh and
he too was hospitalized with stab wounds in his hands.
   Police say the man attacked Abu Sneineh after Mizrahi refused
his demands that he fire the Arab. The assailant said he was
against Arabs working in Israel, newspapers said.
   ``I worked for Israelis. I was their friend and they mine ...
They stabbed me and slashed me. What did I do?'' Abu Sneineh said.
   But Abu Sneineh says it will not affect his good relations with
Jews, but he doesn't think he will return to the butcher's shop.
   As he talked, he leaned out of the window at Hadassah-Ein Karem
Hospital, smoking a cigarette and occasionally wincing from the
pain of his wound.
   ``What am I supposed to think?'' he said. ``I hate my life.''
   ``I don't even know why my father sold the apartment. He died,
and with him his truth. But the Arabs don't let us forget his
mistake,'' he said.

   Every day after the evening television
newscast, Iranians are told which of their numerous coupons they
can exchange for modest rations of cooking oil, meat, rice and
detergent.
   The 8-year war with Iraq which sapped Iran's resources ended in
August 1988 and Tehran is earning a windfall from higher oil prices
caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   But shortages persist and the economy remains sluggish despite
strenuous efforts by President Hashemi Rafsanjani to revitalize it.
   That's a major setback for Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's
so-called pragmatists, and his drive to consolidate power by
improving conditions for the country's 55 million people.
   He's trying to liberalize the economy while improving relations
with the West to attract badly needed investment and technology.
His radical rivals bitterly oppose his strategy, alleging it
deviates from the revolutionary ideals of the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, who died last year.
   Earlier this week the government pushed a plan through
Parliament to seek $17.5 billion in foreign loans, a move the House
had resisted even during the war.
   The government is under continual pressure to alleviate
shortages, boost output and free Iranians from the economic
hardship they have endured since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   Last month Hasan Al-Hoseyni, a member of Parliament from the
city of Arak, complained that Iran's deplorable economic conditions
have brought ``ever-increasing pressure to bear on society's weak
and middle classes.''
   He demanded action and declared: ``No other issue must
overshadow this important task.''
   The Farsi-language Bayan monthly said: ``The first problem
facing the government in its attempt to improve the state of the
economy and to lessen the pressures on the underprivileged masses
is inflation.''
   Iranian consumers know about inflation.
   Salaried workers, earning a monthly average of 70,000 rials
($1,000 at the official exchange rate), cannot keep up with runaway
prices.
   In Tehran, a month's salary is hardly enough to pay the rent for
a one-bedroom apartment, buy two meals for four at a good
restaurant or even one car tire.
   Earlier this year, a survey by the Geneva-based National
statistics organization listed Tehran, with a population of about 7
million, as the world's most expensive city.
   The center reported that living costs for an average urban
family last year were 1.8 million rials ($26,000), more than double
the average annual income.
   Borrowing, which accounts for about one-quarter of the current
budget, soared along with prices, IRNA reported. It quoted Isshaq
Jahangiri, deputy chairman of Parliament's Planning and Budget
Committee, as saying borrowing had to be increased to supplement
shortfalls in revenue. He gave no figures.
   Since the Persian Gulf crisis triggered by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2 sent oil prices shooting up, Iran has been earning
an extra $33 million a day in precious foreign exchange.
   But Jahangiri said that windfall still falls short of the $15
billion in oil revenue projected in the budget.
   In a bid to revive the post-war economy, Rafsanjani has
announced a record $30 billion budget for the current Iranian year,
which ends March 21. The budget is the first phase of his $112
billion five-year plan.
   But four months before the end of the year, the budget has been
revamped because most of its projections were not realized.
   Jahangiri said that a large chunk of the deficit was due to the
government's inability to collect taxes, which were to account for
40 percent of revenue.

<HEAD>Fans Flock to Help Willie Nelson Out of $16 Million Tax Jam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Willie Nelson raised millions with his Farm
Aid concerts. Now the country music star's fans say it's time to
return the favor with ``Willie Aid'' and help Nelson out of a $16
million tax jam.
   Nelson, who with singer John Cougar Mellencamp founded the Farm
Aid movement to save struggling farmers from foreclosure, had 22 of
his properties in four states seized by the Internal Revenue
Service last week. The IRS says Nelson owes $16.7 million in back
taxes, interest and penalties for 1975-78 and 1980-82.
   ``If everybody'd just give a dollar, everybody who loves him and
his music, we'd get it in no time,'' said Annetta White, co-owner
of Austin's Broken Spoke dance hall, where Nelson was a frequent
performer in the 1960s.
   Mrs. White and others are spearheading fund-raising drives to
help Nelson, who has won five Grammys and whose platinum-selling
albums include ``Stardust,'' ``Poncho and Lefty'' and ``Red-Headed
Stranger.''
   Among properties seized were Nelson's Pedernales Country Club
and recording studio near Austin and his Pedernales Fishing Camp.
Also seized were land and houses in Colorado, Alabama and
Washington state, said IRS spokeswoman Silvia Tovar.
   Ms. Tovar said agency rules prohibited her from saying whether
Nelson has paid any of the bill. She said no date had been set for
auctioning the properties.
   Nelson, 57, reportedly was in Hawaii this week and not available
for comment. Neither his lawyer nor his manager returned calls
Thursday.
   Nelson has said a former business manager did not file the
singer's tax returns and left his finances in a shambles.
   Mrs. White and her husband, James, are organizing a benefit
dance Dec. 2 and contacting such performers as George Strait for
items they might auction.
   James Hataway, a barber in nearby West Lake Hills, said he is
opening a bank account for people who want to donate. ``I'm just a
little guy, a fan who's got all of his records,'' he said. ``But I
think we ought to help Willie out.''
   In Waco, near Nelson's hometown of Abbott, auto parts salesman
Dave Crowe proposed that fans join ``Willie Aid'' by mailing
donations straight to the IRS.
   ``He's given of himself. Now he is sideways with the IRS through
no fault of his own,'' Crowe said.
   In Washington, the National Coalition of IRS Whistleblowers
accused the government of going after Nelson because of his
celebrity.
   ``The IRS as a matter of fact takes a celebrity case each year
and talks it up to put the fear of God in people,'' said director
Lisa Lashawa. ``If the whole intention is to get the money owed,
why not let him sell a couple of his properties?''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson says the Japanese should regard
black Americans as fellow victims of ignorant prejudice and invest
some of their wealth in black enterprises.
   ``African-Americans have a special relationship with you as
Third World people,'' Jackson said in a Thursday night speech to
the Japan Commerce Association.
   He said many white Americans are upset with both blacks and
Japanese.
   ``They are angry at the Japanese for `buying up America.' The
same kind of stereotype they used to have of Jewish-Americans is
now transferred in many ways to Japanese ... and they are now angry
at blacks for sharing in the remaining jobs,'' he said.
   Jackson, a two-time unsuccessful presidential candidate, was
elected last week to a ``shadow senator'' post from the District of
Columbia. In the unpaid position, he will lobby Congress for
District statehood.
   His invitation to speak to the Japan Commerce Association, an
organization of Washington-based Japanese corporate
representatives, follows a remark by Japan's Justice Minister
Seiroku Kajiyama last September that prostitutes moving into a
Tokyo neighborhood had the same effect as blacks moving into a
neighborhood in America.
   Both Kajiyama and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu apologized, but
many outraged blacks said Kajiyama should have been ousted from the
Kaifu cabinet.
   Jackson said corporate Japan should show more sensitivity to the
plural makeup of the United States - and to the spending power of
the U.S. black community - by holding a ``summit'' with leading
blacks on investment and economic development.
   Jackson said such meetings would be a better way to get results
than insults and picketing of the Japanese Embassy.
   He said also that the Japanese should invest in the U.S. ``urban
crisis,'' the problem of decaying and drug-ridden inner cities
populated by many poor minority Americans.

   Hildegard Behrens sang the title role in the
Metropolitan Opera's first presentation of Richard Strauss'
``Salome'' on Thursday, saving her voice at the beginning so she
could pour it out at the end and not so much dancing the dance of
seven veils as twirling around.
   In many ways, this production of ``Salome'' works against the
opera. It's a big, black-walled basement with a pit where John the
Baptist is held. Upstairs, on balconies and in windowed rooms
decorated with pagan frescos, are seen people in lavish party
dress.
   The impact of the wickedness of Salome's mother, Herodias, is
lessened because of the general decadence being conveyed. Helga
Dernesch sang Herodias well and looked sophisticated in a chic gown
and sleek blonde hairdo.
   Salome's adolescent sexual awakening, to an inaccessible man,
isn't conveyed.
   Richard Cassilly was excellent as Herod. His voice often had an
appropriate hollow tone.
   James Conlon was conducting the opera at the Met for the first
time. At the beginning, Behrens sounded thinner than she does in
Wagner operas and one wondered if Strauss' textured orchestration
was drowning her out. Later, as her high notes pealed out, it
became clear that she had been holding back.
   Ekkehard Wlaschiha sang John the Baptist with ringing tones.
After he pushed Salome away during their first meeting, he began to
sing with personality as well. When he sang from down in his pit,
he sounded muffled, like Fafner the dragon in Wagner's
``Siegfried.''
   Tenor Peter Zazaras, in his debut season at the Met, made a
strong impression as Narraboth, the young man who loves Salome but
stabs himself in horror at her excesses.
   Behrens wears the pink dress with fluffy sleeves of the
production two years ago but doesn't lift off chiffon panels of the
skirt one by one as her veils, which did look silly. She lifts off
one panel, twirls around holding it, then takes off and flings the
whole dress, leaving her in a white gown with short sleeves.
   Also, she falls on the floor at the end; guards don't rush in
and crush her with their shields.
   The good thing about this ``Salome'' was the performance of the
music.

   Fans longing to own a piece of Greta Garbo found
no slouch hat, dark glasses or cigarette holder for sale at the
third and last auction of her possessions.
   But plenty of bidders paid high prices Thursday for the
porcelain and enamel boxes, leather-bound books and Louis XV chairs
that once filled the reclusive actress' apartment.
   ``Thanks, Mom!'' cried Constance Ford, a New York actress, when
she placed a winning bid of $2,250 at Sotheby's for a pottery
figure of a clown.
   ``I figured mother and Garbo at the moment were having tea, and
mother said, `Make sure she gets it,''' Ford said of her late
mother.
   Neither she nor her mother knew Garbo, but ``I think everyone
felt very close to her,'' said Ford. ``She was mystical and
exciting and extremely gifted.''
   On Tuesday, Garbo's most important painting, an 1889 portrait by
Renoir of his nephew, sold for $7 million.
   Thursday's auction was not about great works of art; it was
about the film legend and the elegant world she created in her
apartment on Manhattan's East Side.
   A pair of Louis XV beechwood chairs went for $88,000. A
two-drawer tulipwood parquetry commode sold for $68,750.
   Small paintings and little porcelain boxes that were estimated
to sell for $100 to $200 went for 30 times that amount. An oil
painting of a white terrier, valued at $600 to $800, sold for
$18,700.
   French enamel snuff boxes sold for several thousand dollars. A
porcelain scent bottle in the shape of a wizard, valued at $500 to
$700, sold for $18,700.
   ``I think she would have wanted someone like me to have
something, instead of the people who have all the bucks,'' said
Sherry Ostrow of West Orange, N.J. ``I was going to buy the
smallest possible item. I'm really very unhappy I'm going away
empty-handed.''
   The total for the three-day sale was $20.7 million. The pre-sale
estimate was $16.9 million to $23.5 million.
   Garbo, who died April 15 at age 84, bought most of her
paintings, furniture and other art objects on her walks incognito
through Manhattan. In the art and antique shops she frequented, she
was known as Mrs. Brown or simply G.G.
   The actress never hired a decorator for her apartment. She chose
her own colors - mostly roses, salmons and greens - arranged her
furniture and hung paintings herself.
   Other paintings sold earlier in the week included Renoir's
``Leontine and Coco Reading,'' for $5.7 million, and Bonnard's
``Corn Poppies,'' for $3.2 million.

<HEAD>Wellstone Doesn't Hide Dislike For New Colleague</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Wellstone's first meeting with Sen. Jesse
Helms is likely to be a little tense.
   ``I have detested him since I was 19, and moreover I think he
won against Harvey Gantt on a blatantly racist campaign. Period.
It's true,'' said Wellstone, elected last week as Minnesota's
junior senator.
   The Senate is something of a club and members rarely attack each
other personally. Wellstone, a liberal Democrat, has spent the week
opening friendships that will be critical to his success in the
Senate.
   But he has made it clear in media interviews that he does not
like Helms, the arch-conservative North Carolina Republican who
last week defeated Gantt to win a fourth term. Gantt, the former
mayor of Charlotte, is black.
   Wellstone first heard Helms while studying at the University of
North Carolina in the 1960s and has ``despised him ever since,''
the new lawmaker said in an interview with the Philadelphia
Inquirer last week.
   Helms, who has never met Wellstone, responded Thursday with some
advice for the new senator:
   ``I hope that he will prove to be somewhat more stable. ...
Otherwise he's going to have a difficult time in the Senate.''

<HEAD>GOP National Committee Cutting Staff 25 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republican National Committee is firing a
fourth of its staff, but party officials say the reduction is a
normal beginning for a non-election year.
   ``We gear up in the even years and we gear down in the odd
years,'' said Mary Matalin, RNC executive director. The committee
has about 270 fulltime employees.
   B.J. Cooper, communications director for the committee, said a
comparable staff reduction occurred four years ago, after the 1986
midterm elections.
   Matalin and Cooper denied published reports the cutbacks were
forced by a disappointing fund-raising year or were ordered by
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.
   ``We're 100 percent supportive of their effort to shift gears,''
said Ed Rogers, White House political director. ``There was no
instruction to do anything out of here; it's part of a longstanding
plan. The White House was informed of it on an FYI basis the day
before yesterday.''
   The RNC had an operating budget for 1990 of $26 million and
raised more than enough to cover it.
   At the Democratic National Committee, spokeswoman Ginny Terzano
said no immediate cutbacks are planned. But the DNC is a much
leaner operation with only 100 fulltime employees.
   The Democrats raised just over $10 million in 1990, including a
record $2.7 million Wednesday night at the party's annual gala.

<HEAD>Warming Of Lake May Preview Greenhouse Effects In Canadian Lakes
Region</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadian researchers say those wanting a
glimpse of what would happen if the Earth warms from the greenhouse
effect should look at Ontario, Canada.
   Portions of the province are plagued with increased forest
fires, less snow, warmer lakes and fewer trout, they say, though
not from the greenhouse effect.
   Lakes monitored for more than 20 years in northwestern Ontario
have been slowly changing as temperatures rise, snowfall declines
and fires ravage nearby forests, scientists at the Canadian
Department of Fisheries and Oceans report today in the journal
Science.
   While the study does not claim that the changes are due to the
greenhouse effect, the group's leader, D.W. Schindler, said the
changes could be a preview of what is to come if the Earth does
warm up.
   ``This is by no means the only period that has warmed for a
prolonged time or at the rate that we're seeing,'' Schindler said.
``Our point is ... to show what increasing warming and drying,
which we would see with a greenhouse effect, would do to lakes and
their watersheds.''
   The greenhouse effect refers to global warming that is caused
when the atmosphere is enriched with carbon dioxide and some other
gases that affect the movement of solar radiation and heat. The
so-called greenhouse gases allow sunlight to pass through the
atmosphere and strike the Earth. But the gases can prevent heat
from radiating back out into space, thus trapping thermal energy
about the planet.
   An increase in carbon dioxide is related to the burning of
fossil fuels, such as coal and oil.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Slightly in Light Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Uncertainties about the Middle East caused light
trading on the foreign exchange and the stock market in Tokyo
today, dealers said. The dollar rose slightly against the yen and
share prices fell again.
   The dollar closed at 129.73 yen, up 0.43 yen from Thursday's
close of 129.30 yen. After opening at 129.85 yen, it ranged from
129.63 yen to 129.95 yen.
   On the Tokyo stock exchange, trading was sluggish with volume on
the first section at 300 million.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished at 23,171.63 points,
down 315.85 points or 1.34 percent from Thursday's close at
23,487.48 points.
   But the subdued trading, totaling $5.97 billion in spot
transactions, lacked direction in the absence of fresh
market-affecting news, brokers said.
   Market players are still waiting on the sidelines for a change
in the Persian Gulf situation, traders said. The dollar tends to be
strong at times of international tension, while the yen is
weakened.
   Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said some
investors are waiting for a series of U.S. economic reports
scheduled for release today.
   But many traders did not foresee a radical plunge in the dollar
even if the Federal Reserve makes the long-anticipated move to
lower interest rates.
   Hiroyuki Takabe, a dealer at Yasuda Trust and Banking, said the
subsequent profit-taking may even encourage a rush to buy dollars,
unless the federal fund rate - the rate banks charge each other for
overnight loans - is lowered by more than .25 percent.
   Masunori Ishitobi, a researcher at Sanyo Securities Co., said
the blue chip average was adjusting after a 1,041.87-point jump
Tuesday, following the three-day weekend. Last week, the Nikkei
shed 1,033.95 points in three trading days, dropping to a
22,931.80-point close last Friday.
   Yoshiyuki Nishiguchi, a dealer at Daiwa Securities Co., noted a
consistent pattern recently for share prices to pick up in the
earlier part of the week, then plunge as the trading week ended.
   Nishiguchi said market players turn cautious because ``there's a
feeling that anything can happen over the weekend.''
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 84.77 points at 3 a.m. EST from
Thursday's 84.47-point finish. Their yield was lower at 7.760
percent from 7.830.

   Members of Poland's small Jewish community
and other denominations have joined in marking 50 years since Nazi
troops sealed off the Warsaw Ghetto.
   Representatives of the Jewish organizations and the
Jerusalem-based Yad Vashem Holocaust institute laid flowers
Thursday at the Umschlagplatz monument, a site from which tens of
thousands of Jews were transported to death camps.
   Clergy and believers of different Christian denominations joined
in prayers at the Ghetto wall, the so-called ``Wall of Tears.''
   The ceremonies began on the eve of the anniversary and continue
through Monday.
   The Warsaw Ghetto, which the Nazis used as a collecting center
for Jews from all over Poland, was set up in October 1940. On Nov.
16, 1940 the Nazis sealed off the district, into which 400,000
people were packed, ravaged by hunger and disease.
   At least 250,000 were deported to the death camps in Treblinka
and Auschwitz in July 1942, when large scale deportations began.
   Following the April 1943 uprising in the Ghetto, the Nazis
killed the last survivors and razed the district.

<HEAD>Ex-Lockheed Employees Awarded $45.3 Million in Whistleblower Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. says it will appeal a jury's
$45.3 million award to three employees who claimed they were
wrongfully fired for questioning the safety of the defense
contractor's mammoth C-5B cargo plane.
   A Superior Court jury made the award Thursday to Clyde W. Jones
Jr., 62, Terrence F. Schielke, 50, and Thomas E. Benecke, 48.
   The three said they were dismissed in 1985 after questioning the
structural stability of the plane, now being used to ferry troops
to the Persian Gulf.
   ``We believe the punitive damages are an injustice and come as a
result of appealing to the passions and prejudice of the jury,''
said Lockheed attorney Gordon Krischer. ``The evidence doesn't
warrant this verdict.''
   Krischer said the planes were checked by the Air Force and found
to be safe.
   Former Lockheed Chairman Lawrence O. Kitchen testified the men
behaved unprofessionally in going outside the company to obtain
independent metallurgical tests on the C-5B.
   He said that Jones had already elected to retire before Lockheed
officials learned of the employees' concerns. Schielke and Benecke
were fired for circumventing company policies and audit procedures,
Kitchen said.
   ``I just wonder what else is wrong with the rest of their
airplanes,'' said juror Jackey Grundman.
   Each of the plaintiffs was awarded $15 million in punitive
damages. Awards for compensatory damages and emotional distress
totaled $202,065 for Benecke, $91,660 for Jones and $82,789 for
Schielke.
   Eric Julber, who represented Benecke, said the award sends ``a
message that you shouldn't fire people for raising safety
concerns.''
   ``The frames were cracked, warped, twisted,'' Schielke said
Thursday. ``And instead of scrapping them they went ahead and used
them because it would have put them so far behind schedule to scrap
them that the Defense Department would not have bought the
planes.''
   Herbert Hafif, attorney for Jones and Schielke, said four planes
built with defective mainframes are being used to ferry troops to
Saudi Arabia.
   ``Our next move is to ask the Congress to investigate this,'' he
said.
   Jones was a senior quality control inspector at Lockheed's
Marietta, Ga., plant on loan to California installations in Burbank
and Palmdale. Schielke was an auditor at Burbank and Benecke an
auditor at Palmdale.
   Jones lives in Tennessee. Schielke lives in Lancaster, Calif.,
and Benecke in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
   Financial analysts said Lockheed can afford to cover the award.
   The Calabasas-based aerospace company has an estimated $100
million cash on hand and is expected to generate profits this year
of $315 million, said securities analyst Lawrence M. Harris of
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards.

<HEAD>Official Says Military Suspected In Killing Of 18 Found in Common
Grave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says the remains of 18 farmers
found in a common grave last month may have been killed by members
of the military.
   The interior minister, Gen. Jorge Torres Aciego, told reporters
Thursday that the government ``would try to investigate to find out
who was responsible, and will severly punish them ... whether it be
the navy, army or the air force.''
   Local farmers said they discovered the bodies in a common grave
in the remote mountainous area of Chilcahuayco, 9 miles northeast
of Ayacucho.
   The farmers said they recognized the bodies of relatives
detained by the armed forces in an anti-terrorist operation in late
September.
   Farmers reported the find to the Ayacucho district attorney on
Oct. 17.
   Ayacucho, a departmental capital 230 miles southeast of Lima, is
the birthplace of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla movement, which
began its war of insurgency 10 years ago.
   For the first time since December 1982, the government lifted
the emergency zone status of the city of Ayacucho on Oct. 24, but
the area around the city remains under military control.
   More than 20,000 people have died in political violence since
the Shining Path took up arms to overthrow the
democratically-elected government in 1980.

<HEAD>Opinion Poll Boosts Heseltine Hopes Of Replacing Thatcher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former defense secretary Michael Heseltine's bid
to replace Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was boosted today by an
opinion poll that showed support for a change in leadership.
   The survey showed that if Heseltine replaced Mrs. Thatcher as
leader of the governing Conservative Party - which would
automatically make him prime minister - the Tories would shoot to a
10-point lead over the opposition Labor Party.
   The poll, conducted by Market and Opinion Research International
and published in The Times of London, showed that if Mrs. Thatcher
remained party leader and prime minister, the Conservatives would
trail Labor, their main challenger, by four points.
   The Tories have trailed Labor in opinion polls for the past 16
months. The next general election by law must be held by mid-1992.
But the prime minister can call one any time before that.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said the
poll's findings ``represent an enormous boost for Mr. Heseltine's
chances of wresting the leadership from Mrs. Thatcher.''
   Heseltine, 57, on Thursday formally submitted his bid for the
leadership of the Conservative Party.
   He will challenge the 65-year-old Mrs. Thatcher in a secret
ballot Tuesday among the 372 Conservative legislators in the House
of Commons. It is the first serious challenge to her leadership
since she took office in 1979.
   To win Tuesday, a candidate needs 50 percent of the votes cast
and have at least 15 percent more than the runner-up.
   A second ballot, if necessary, would be held on Nov. 27, and
other candidates are free to come forward. The winner needs only to
get a majority.
   The opinion poll was based on face-to-face interviews with 1,088
people after the close of nominations for the Conservative - or
Tory - leadership on Thursday. Heseltine was the only nominated
challenger.
   The poll showed 49 percent of the respondents would support the
Conservatives if Heseltine became leader, compared with 39 percent
for Labor and seven percent for the Liberal Democrats. The other
five percent was split among smaller parties.
   If Mrs. Thatcher survives Heseltine's challenge, Labor would
have 45 percent support; Tories 41 percent, and Liberal Democrats
10 percent, according to the poll. It did not state a margin of
error.
   Another newspaper, The Independent, reported today that a survey
of London-based Japanese investors showed 54 percent would be more
inclined to buy shares in British companies if there were a new
Tory leader. The survey was conducted by the securities house
Nomura.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who won general elections in 1979, 1983 and 1987,
said on Thursday she intends to fight for the job. She was
responding to a Labor legislator who held up a 5-year-old newspaper
in which she'd promised to quit in 1990.
   Heseltine, reported to be a millionaire, resigned his Cabinet
post as defense secretary in 1986 in a Cabinet dispute over how to
save the ailing Westland helicopter company.
   In an interview Thursday with Independent Television, he said he
was inspired to challenge Mrs. Thatcher following speech in the
House of Commons Tuesday by Sir Geoffrey Howe.
   Howe, who resigned as deputy prime minister on Nov. 1,
criticized Mrs. Thatcher for her opposition among European Economic
Community leaders to more rapid pace for European unity.
   Discord has been building in the Conservative Party for more
than a year, partly over Mrs. Thatcher's attitude toward EC
policies. Other problems include interest rates of 14 percent,
annual inflation of 11.9 percent and a per-capita ``poll'' tax that
sparked widespread rioting earlier this year.
   Heseltine has promised to order an immediate review of the tax
if he wins. He has also pledged to introduce what he calls ``caring
capitalism'' to replace Mrs. Thatcher's rigorous free-market
policies which critics say benefit the rich at the expense of a
growing number of the poor.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Gorbachev promising military shuffle,

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today promised a
shakeup in the military leadership and defended his plan to rescue
the collapsing economy and prevent rebellious republics from
breaking away.
   It was not immediately clear why Gorbachev was calling for the
shakeup and he did not elaborate in his speech to lawmakers in the
Supreme Soviet legislature.
   He denied he had lost the support of the army, as one legislator
implied after a meeting between the Soviet president and deputies
serving in the military.
   The official Tass news agency said Gorbachev told legislators
that there would be personnel changes in the higher commanding
echelons of the armed forces and documents were being prepared for
submission to the legislature.
   Gorbachev also said that in the near future, he would nullify
decisions by union republics and local governments that denied
soldiers and their families civil rights, particularly in the
independence-minded Baltic republics.
   He was responding to legislatures in several republics that deny
some civil rights to members of the Soviet military and curtailed
the draft in regions seeking independence.
   The Soviet leader denounced what he called ``vile rumors'' that
the country would suffer from cold and starvation during the
upcoming winter and rejected the idea of a coalition government
with the Russian Federation.
   ``No more defensive action; it is high time to launch an
offensive,'' Gorbachev said, delivering a report to the Supreme
Soviet at the demand of rebellious deputies.
   Gorbachev's report came as he was losing support from former
loyalists. The current Moscow News, a weekly that has been a
supporter of his reforms, urged him ``to either prove your ability
to take decisive actions or resign.''
   ``At your demand, you were given additional powers,'' the
publication's founders said in an open letter to Gorbachev.
``Today, you can either use them for establishment a dictatorship
or for deepening democratic perestroika. A dictatorship will lead
you and the whole country to ruin.''
   Gorbachev rejected accusations that the central government had
no plans to combat the deteriorating economic and political
situation and ethnic strife. ``We have a concrete program, and it
must be fulfilled.''
   Although the economic picture was bleak, Gorbachev rejected
``vile rumors that the country will be hungry and cold.'' He
explained that the problem lay in the delivery system and that
there was ample food in the country to meet reasonable demands.
   His speech came a day after Leningrad's City Council voted to
join a growing list of Soviet cities rationing food.
   Bowing to demands by legislators for a report on his meeting
with Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin last weekend,
Gorbachev said their discussions were routine.
   He said sharing power with only the Russian Federation would be
unfair to the other republics. ``In a coaltion government, if
Russian leaders take over, it will mean discrimination against the
other republics,'' Gorbachev said.
   Instead, he repeated his call for a country unified by a new
union treaty spelling out the relationship between the central
government and the republics.
   ``We don't need political leaders who stimulate separatism and
nationalism, we need help to consolidate the country,'' Gorbachev
said.
   Referring to his meeting with Yeltsin, the Soviet leader said,
``it was just routine. People said it was a sensation, but it was
just regular work.''
   The two leaders discussed the union treaty that would hold the
15 republics together in a single country and Gorbachev said he
gave assurances that Russian economic interests would be ``taken
into account'' in any agreement.
   All but one of the republics have declared some sort of
sovereignty from the Kremlin and Gorbachev's plans for developing a
market economy hinge on the republics staying in the union.
   The Supreme Soviet session today was attended by most leaders of
the 15 republics, union leaders and members of Gorbachev's advisory
council.
   There was no live television or radio coverage of Gorbachev's
report.
   The Soviet leader agreed on Wednesday to address the legislature
after delegates, angry about the slow pace of reform, abandoned
their agenda on Wednesday and demanded a report on the state of the
union and his meeting last weekend with Yeltsin.
   Many republics, especially Russia, are disregarding laws passed
by the national legislature and decrees adopted by Gorbachev and
the Council of Ministers, or Soviet cabinet.
   According to Tass, legislators at the Supreme Soviet became
rebellious Wednesday and refused to discuss bills ``suggested from
above'' until a new treaty on relations between the Kremlin and the
republics is concluded.

Gulf crisis:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Saudi troops conduct the second day ``Imminent
Thunder'' military exercises Friday in Saudi Arabia near the Kuwait
border.
   Military officials have released few details about the
operation. About 1,000 U.S. troops and an unknown number of Saudi
soliders are taking part in the six-day maneuvers. Also involved
are about 1,100 aircraft and 16 ships, including the aircraft
carrier USS Midway.
   Iraq has termed the exercises a ``provocative act'' because they
are being held close to occupied Kuwait.
   ---
   Secretary of State James A Baker III was scheduled to meet with
representatives of the 12-nation European Community on Friday to
discuss the Persian Gulf and other issues. He scheduled talks with
the foreign ministers of Romania, Finland and three African nations
over the weekend.
   ---
   President Bush was scheduled to leave Friday evening for an
eight-day trip to Europe and the Middle East.
   Part of the trip will be used to discuss the gulf with key
allies and guage reaction to a possible U.N. Security Council
resolution that would authorize U.N. force to drive Iraq from
Kuwait. Some diplomats say the resolution could come by the end of
the month.
   Bush plans to join U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia on Thanksgiving
Day. It would be the first presidential visit to front-line
soldiers since 1967 in Vietnam.
   ----
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein suggested a peaceful solution is
still possible and indicated he could release foreign hostages if
Bush promised not to attack Iraq.
   In an ABC-TV interview aired Thursday, Saddam said Iraq favors a
peace that it ``comprehensive, complete and final.'' But Saddam did
not elaborate on the framework of a possible settlement, but noted
that ``whoever hits us, we shall hit them back.''
   ---
   The Soviet Union's top Middle East envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, said
Thursday world leaders should not rule out talks on a possible
Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait which include discussions on the
Palestinian question.
   Primakov, in a speech in New York, said Saddam should be given
the opportunity for a ``face-saving'' withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Saddam has earlier stressed linking talks on Kuwait to the
question of Israel's occupation of lands claimed by Palestinians.
   ---
   The State Department said more than 100 Americans and their
foreign-born family members are expected to leave Kuwait on Sunday
aboard a U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways flight. Most are women and
children who had been eligible to leave for some time but decided
only recently to depart, a spokesman said.

   Water so foul that parents won't let their babies
drink it. Soil so tainted that it can no longer be saved. Air so
deadly that each breath is a step toward respiratory disease, and
life expectancy is cut short.
   The haze-covered land once called East Germany is every bit the
environmental disaster that it has long been believed to be, a new
study says.
   The united German government's first comprehensive look at its
new territory gives a bleak overview of the ecological wasteland
left behind by the Communists, and the daunting challenge of
repairing it.
   Right now, the east's environment poses ``a considerable health
threat to the population,'' Environmental Minister Klaus Toepfer
said in Berlin.
   About 10 million of the land's 16 million people have drinking
water that is ``at times or permanently of harmful quality,'' he
said.
   Toepfer said the government will spend $86 million this year
toward cleaning up the land, but that a massive, long-term effort
is needed to eliminate its myriad health hazards.
   ``We now have to build up an information network and draw up a
list of priorities,'' he said at a news conference Thursday
coinciding with the release of the 158-page report.
   Among the findings:
   About 1,000 of the former nation's 7,565 villages have drinking
water so high in nitrates that infants are routinely given bottled
water.
   Almost half of the rivers and lakes are so polluted that they no
longer can be processed for drinking water.
   Only 3 percent of the rivers and 1 percent of the standing
water, such as lakes and canals, are considered ecologically sound.
   Only 38 percent of the household sewage is treated before it is
dumped into canals.
   Toepfer said that more than 40 percent of the ground is
considered spoiled, and huge areas in industrial regions are so
contaminated that the topsoil would literally have to be trucked
away for the land to be salvaged.
   The report says eastern Germans are more likely to live shorter
lives than their western countrymen.
   According to 1985 data, East German men had a life expectancy of
69.5 years, about 2.5 years below that of West German men. Women
had a life span of 71.5 years, seven years below the average in the
west.
   East Germany had the most productive industrial economy of the
old East Bloc, but the former leadership paid virtually no
attention to environmental concerns.
   Most of the cars - Trabants - had heavily polluting two-cycle
engines. Wastewater went untreated. Farmers used fertilizers and
pesticides at twice the rate as their counterparts in the West, the
report says.
   Sewage and wastewater dumping and the use of inorganic
fertilizers have created serious groundwater contamination, the
report says.
   Perhaps no single factor has spoiled the air more than the use
of brown coal, or lignite, which was mined in East Germany and is a
major source of energy for industries and homes.
   Lignite is responsible for the heavy concentrations of sulfur
dioxide and dust in the air, which has caused extremely high rates
of bronchitis and asthma, particularly in children, the report
says.
   The heavy industrialized southern cities of former East Germany
are the hardest hit, with 20 percent higher rates of respiratory
ailments than in the north, it said.
   Factories had few if any pollution controls, a major factor in
the lack of interest among Western investors in taking over the
vast majority of the former state-run enterprises.
   High lead content was found in vegetables and fruit grown in
industrial areas, and in the blood of people living there.
   PCBs, heavy metals, dioxins and other toxic materials have been
found in high quantities in air and water, it said.

<TEXT>
   A Swiss vehicle using newly developed
solar cells crossed the finish line today about 250 miles ahead of
the second-place entry in the 1,875-mile World Solar Challenge.
   Supporters rang cow bells as the ``Spirit of Biel'' crossed the
line south of Adelaide on Australia's southern coast. The car,
which resembles a pink-and-blue cockroach, took the lead on Sunday
after leaving the starting line in the northern city of Darwin.
   The highly favored Honda entry from Japan was in second place
late today and was not expected to finish until Saturday morning.
   Three cars - Japan's Hoxan Corp. and U.S. entries from
University of Michigan and Western Washington University - were
battling for third.
   The Swiss entry from Biel University averaged 40.1 mph and
finished in an unofficial time of 46 hours, 23 minutes. That was 90
minutes off the record set by General Motors' Sunraycer in the
inaugural race three years ago.
   The Biel car finished third in 1987 after it suffering a
collision near Alice Springs, near the halfway mark.
   The Swiss was built at a cost of about $1 million, much of it
raised by the 53,000 citizens of Biel.
   The car was powered by revolutionary silicon solar cells
developed at the University of New South Wales in Australia by
Professor Martin Green and Dr. Stuart Wenham.
   The laser-grooved cells turn the sun's rays into electrical
energy at a 17 percent efficiency rate, four percent higher than
others, university officials said.
   Biel team leader Fredy Sidler said the energy consumed by the
car over six days was equal to less than 1{ gallons of gasoline.
   The winning team received a trophy of a globe topped by the sun.
   The 36-team entry list included 11 cars each from Australia and
Japan, eight from the United States and one each from Canada,
Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, New Zealand and Britain.
   There were only three official dropouts, although several cars
were reported to have traveled only 125 miles. They have another
five days to officially finish the race.

   Paramount Pictures Corp. and the producers of
such hits as ``Top Gun'' and ``Days of Thunder'' are going their
separate ways.
   The studio and producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer
agreed to split less than a year into their five-year contract
because the ``environment for motion picture production has
changed,'' said David Kirkpatrick, president of the Paramount
Motion Picture Group.
   ``Our philosophy continues to focus on internal development and
production control,'' Kirkpatrick said in a statement Thursday.
   Simpson and Bruckheimer declined to comment.
   The pair joined Paramount in February under a contract whose
terms were not disclosed. Their latest movie, this summer's ``Days
of Thunder'' starring Tom Cruise, cost about $63 million to
produce, about $14 million over budget.
   The film grossed $80 million in the United States, but Paramount
reportedly has yet to turn a profit.
   ``Days of Thunder'' was the first movie produced by Simpson and
Bruckheimer since ``Beverly Hills Cop II'' in 1987. Before that,
they produced a string of hits, including ``Flashdance'' in 1983,
``Beverly Hills Cop'' in 1984 and ``Top Gun'' in 1986.

<HEAD>Iraq Invites IAEA Inspection of Nuclear Facilities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iraq has invited international inspectors
to verify it is not developing weapons at its nuclear research
sites as tension in the Persian Gulf rises, an International Atomic
Energy Agency spokesman said today.
   The United Nations agency inspects Iraqi and other nuclear
facilities at six-month intervals, under the Non-Proliferation
Treaty that prohibits the spread of nuclear technology for
non-peaceful use.
   Iraq's representative to the IAEA, Rahim Al-Kital, told the
agency's director-general, Hans Blix, three weeks ago that ``the
doors were open'' for a routine inspection at the country's four
nuclear research sites, spokesman Hans-Friedrich Meyer said.
   The last inspection was in April. Speculation had arisen that
Baghdad might prohibit visits after the agency suspended technical
assistance in line with U.N. sanctions following Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait Aug. 2.
   With the suspension still in effect, Meyer declined to say in a
telephone interview whether agency inspectors would tour Iraq's two
research reactors, storage and fuel producing facilities.
   Al Kital could not be reached for comment.
   The last inspection found no evidence Iraq was putting uranium
at its nuclear facilities to military use, an agency statement
said.
   Iraq has repeatedly denied allegations by Western media and
Israel, which bombed Iraq's Tammuz-1 reactor in 1981, that it is
developing nuclear weapons.

   The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iraq
has invited its inspectors to verify that Iraq's small stock of
enriched uranium has not been made into an atomic bomb, The New
York Times reported today.
   The move by Iraq as seen as a signal that it does not intend to
use a nuclear weapon in the Persian Gulf crisis, the newspaper
said.
   The uranium in question, a 27.6-pound, orange-size mass
consisting of 93 percent pure uranium 235, was salvaged from Iraq's
Osirak nuclear reactor after it was destroyed by an Israeli
warplanes in 1981, the Times said.
   Iraq obtained the uranium from France in 1976 to operate the
reactor on condition the fuel would be subject to inspection by
international officials.
   There has been concern the high-purity uranium could be easily
made into one primitive bomb, the Times reported. Such a bomb would
have little military value but could be used for a sensational act
of terrorism, the paper said.
   Iraq is a signer of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that
binds signers to renounce the possession or use of nuclear weapons
and to submit to regular inspections of its uranium by
International Atomic Energy Agency officials.
   Such inspections have been carried out every six months and no
violations have been detected, the Times reported.
   Hans Meyer, a spokesman for the agency in Vienna, told the
newspaper that Iraq's ambassador to Austria, Rahim al-Qital,
invited the agency to conduct a new inspection. Meyer would not
disclose when the agency will inspect the fuel.

   NASA lost radio contact with Magellan
again - this time for about 40 minutes - and also had to suspend
the spacecraft's mapping of Venus for nearly a day to adjust its
main antenna ever so slightly.
   The break in radio contact early Thursday was the third time
contact with the craft was lost, and engineers still haven't found
the cause, NASA said.
   After engineers re-established radio contact, they discovered
the craft's main antenna was pointed slightly away from Earth. It
cannot transmit its maps and radar images of Venus unless the
antenna is pointed precisely toward Earth.
   Scientists spent much of Thursday readjusting the antenna, which
was off a scant 1{ degrees, NASA said.
   It was not immediately why the antenna was out of alignment,
NASA said.
   Magellan was launched from space shuttle Atlantis in 1989 on a
$744 million mission to send maps and radar images of Venus back to
Earth. It lost radio contact with NASA for 11 hours on Aug. 16, and
17 hours on Aug. 21.

   Seven peace campaigners headed for Iraq today to
set up peace camps on the Saudi-Kuwaiti border to stand as
voluntary human shields in the event of a U.S. attack.
   ``We are well aware of the consequences of our actions but this
is a point of principle in the traditions of Gandhi,'' said Pat
Arrowsmith, a 60-year-old peace campaigner who left with the group
for Amman, Jordan.
   ``The military forces will have to cross our camps and may even
kill us if they want to fight,'' she said.
   Miss Arrowsmith said Iraqi authorities told the group that it
would be welcome.
   The campaigners hope to drive from Baghdad and select camp sites
on both sides of the border between Iraqi-occupied Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia, where U.S. and other forces have assembled.
   ``It is our intention to select sites in key points which will
prevent the movement of war material and forces,'' said Miss
Arrowsmith, adding that other peace protestors will join them once
the camps were established.
   ``We don't know how many people will eventually be present, but
it could be hundreds. It is a very strong peace movement,'' she
said.

<TEXT>
   Leading U.S. and European Community
officials opened talks today likely to focus on a farm subsidy
policy dispute that has stalled world trade negotiations. The
Persian Gulf crisis was also high on the agenda.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III headed the American
delegation for a second meeting this year with officials of the
12-nation trading bloc.
   ``We hope ... that we will find at least a mechanism or process
for moving forward the discussions,'' Baker told reporters Thursday
aboard his flight to Brussels.
   Even before the meeting began, U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter made stops in
Germany and France to urge some compromises.
   ``We've got a stalemate and we've got a problem,'' Mrs. Hills
said Thursday shortly after her arrival in Brussels.
   It would be difficult to maintain international cooperation on
issues ranging from the environment to the Persian Gulf crisis,
``if you are at each other's throats over trade issues,'' she said.
   The officials were expected to discuss the gulf and economic aid
to Jordan, Egypt and Turkey. Those countries have been hard-hit by
the international trade embargo imposed on Iraq after it invaded
Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Their agenda also included discussions on Eastern Europe.
   At issue in the trade talks is a demand by the United States and
other agriculture-exporting countries that the EC make sharp cuts
in its expensive farm subsidy programs. The community has so far
offered to make only modest reductions.
   The dispute has threatened to scuttle the Uruguay Round of trade
negotiations, an ambitious four-year effort to revamp the world
trading system and reduce barriers to trade in 14 other areas,
including textiles, manufactured goods and services, such as
banking and telecommunications.
   The talks, which began in 1986 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, are
due to end with a final week of bargaining in Brussels starting
Dec. 3.
   But the community's refusal to promise heftier subsidy cuts has
raised doubts about whether the round can be completed
successfully.
   Mrs. Hills warned that international tensions would rise if the
Uruguay Round fails.
   ``We would be headed into a period of much greater friction,''
she said.
   The EC recently proposed to reduce subsidies on major farm crops
by 30 percent over 10 years. Some of the cuts have already been
made.
   The Bush administration has asked for cuts of 75 percent in farm
income supports and 90 percent in export subsidies over a decade,
beginning next year.
   The United States is pushing agriculture reform because it hopes
that lowering trade barriers will enable its farmers to sell more
goods on the world market. Other farm-exporting countries, like
Argentina and Australia, also would like a chance to export more.
   The EC, however, contends it needs its array of agriculture
supports to protect its 10 million farming community, many of whom
have small operations.
   Industrialized nations spent $251 billion on agricultural
subsidies last year, according to estimates from the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development. The community accounted
for $97.5 billion and the United States $67.2 billion.
   EC members are Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Britain, Spain and
Portugal.

   Premier Ante Markovic says
Yugoslavia faces dictatorship or disintegration unless its
quarrelsome republics agree to his liberal economic and political
reforms.
   Markovic told Parliament on Thursday that the country's crisis
``has reached such proportions that the country's existence is
drastically in question.''
   His reforms, including privatization of the economy and the
lifting of import and foreign investment restrictions, have angered
the hard-line leadership of Communist-led Serbia, the largest
Yugoslav republic.
   Serbia's state-run press has accused Markovic of being a Western
agent and of wanting to turn Yugoslavia into a ``banana republic.'
   The non-communist governments in the western republics of
Slovenia and Croatia, which advocate transforming Yugoslavia into a
loose association of near-independent states, are wary of the
Croatian technocrat's insistence on keeping Yugoslavia united as a
federation.
   Last month, Serbia undermined Markovic's reform by unilaterally
abolishing Yugoslavia's common market and introducing duties on
goods from Slovenia and Croatia.
   The two independent-minded republics recently have changed their
constitutions, setting the stage for possible secession from the
current federation of six states and two provinces.
   Markovic said ``unconstitutional policies'' of Slovenia,
Croatia, and Serbia ``inevitably led to the worsening of political
tension in Yugoslavia and most directly jeopardize the country's
existence.''
   He accused the republics of carrying out policies which
``evidently lead to ... the breakup of the country or the
introduction of dictatorship.''
   He did not elaborate.
   ``We must face the fact that we are seen from abroad as one of
the most crisis-ridden regions in Europe, while foreign leaders
consider that Yugoslavia is on the brink of breakup and civil
war,'' Markovic said.
   He said only a united and democratic Yugoslavia would be
accepted into an all-European political and economic system.
   Markovic, prime minister since March 1989, introduced reforms
last December that have throttled runaway inflation and pulled
Yugoslavia from the brink of bankruptcy.
   The reforms won praise from Western creditors, but side-effects
were a sharp drop in industrial output and closure of many
unprofitable companies. That threatens to push up unemployment,
already a hefty 19 percent.
   Initial optimism that Markovic's popularity could overcome the
growing political crisis evaporated in the face of continued
feuding between politicians and ethnic groups.
   Markovic said Yugoslavia would need $2.5 billion more from
foreign creditors next year in order to implement his policies.
Yugoslavia already owes $16 billion to Western banks and
governments.
   Markovic criticized Serbia for illegally withholding $250
million in contributions for the federal budget.

   Authorities investigating a jetliner
crash that killed all 46 people aboard, including seven Americans,
say it could be several months before the cause of the disaster is
fully known.
   Officials Thursday cited pilot error and technical failure as
possible causes of the Wednesday night crash as the Alitalia DC-9
approached Zurich international airport en route from Milan, Italy.
   Radar data showed the plane was flying about 990 feet too low,
Alitalia and Swiss officials said there was no explanation yet for
the low altitude.
   Zurich airport spokesman Andreas Meier said radar data ``suggest
the pilot misjudged his altitude.''
   Alitalia officials on Italian television speculated the plane's
electronic navigation system failed.
   Swiss transporation department spokesman Ulrich Sieber said
investigators may need several months to compile and publish their
report on the inquiry.
   At least seven Americans were aboard the plane, according to the
airline and U.S. Embassy officials.
   The embassy in Bern identified the American victims as Karol
Forman, Paul Vaughan and William Briggs of New York state; John
Stuckey and Jerry Bass of North Carolina; Robert Anderson, an
American resident of Switzerland, and Stephen Ritter of North
Carolina. No hometowns were given.
   The embassy had no further details early today.
   The nationalities of four victims were still undetermined, the
airline said.
   Pope John Paul II offered condolences to the victims' families.
   The plane crashed into a steep wooded hillside, broke up and was
gutted by fire. Zurich police official Eugen Thomann said all
victims likely died on impact.
   Witnesses said the pilot seemed to gun the plane's engines just
before impact about 12{ miles northeast of central Zurich. Some
witnesses reported seeing fire and hearing explosions while the
plane was still in the air.
   Rain on Thursday hampered investigators inspecting the debris.
About 300 rescue and police officials recovered bodies and cleaned
up.
   Since victims were burned beyond recognition, positive
identification could take weeks, Zurich police spokesman Hansrudolf
Suter said.
   Police said the the jet's two flight recorders, or ``black
boxes,'' were found Thursday and will be sent to an English lab for
evaluation. One recorder tracks flight data and the other tapes
cockpit conversation.
   Meier said terrorism was not ruled out, but stressed there was
no immediate indication the plane was a target.
   Alitalia said the two-engine DC-9, built in 1974, was last
inspected 10 days before the crash.

   Milli Vanilli, the dreadlocked pop duo whose
debut album sold 7 million copies, could become the first act to be
stripped of a Grammy after it was learned they didn't sing a single
note on the record.
   ``If there's been a substantial, fraudulent, misrepresentation
of the entity, I think there is a high likelihood that the academy
would have to take some action,'' said Michael Greene, president of
the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences. The academy
administers the Grammy Awards.
   He said the academy's action could include taking back the
group's 1989 Grammy. He said no one has ever been stripped of a
Grammy in its 33 years.
   Frank Farian, the German producer who turned a pair of anonymous
pretty boys into an international phenomenon, revealed in an
interview this week that hunky dudes Fab and Rob - Robert Pilatus
and Fabrice Morvan - were actually the fabulous bunko boys.
   Farian said the bare-chested vocalists once described by The New
York Times as ``exotically sexy'' did nothing more than look good
and lip sync for videos and TV and concert appearances while others
did all the singing.
   ``The record company never knew that. I never told them
anything,'' said Farian. ``Later on, after the record was out,
there were some people who raised some questions.''
   The Vanillis won a Grammy for Best New Artist and Rob and Fab
became international stars. ``Girl You Know It's True'' and ``Blame
It On the Rain'' were both huge hit singles for the band. At the
MTV awards, the boys boasted they were better than Elvis or Bob
Dylan.
   Farian would not say who the real singers were but added that
they will appear on his next album - not a Milli Vanilli album.
   He said Wednesday he was forced to go public with the
revelations when the boys told him they wanted to sing on the
follow-up to ``Girl You Know It's True.''
   ``I said, `No. I don't go for that.' Sure, they have a voice,
but that's not really what I want to use on my records,'' said
Farian.
   In a statement Thursday, the two said they ``have been ready,
willing and able to record our own vocals and have been prevented
by Frank Farian from doing so.''
   And in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Pilatus called
Farian a ``control freak'' who ``would not allow us to enter the
studio.''
   ``He's a white German guy who has a big complex about black
artists,'' said Pilatus, a black native of Germany.
   ``The last two years of our lives have been a total nightmare.
We've had to lie to everybody,'' he said. ``We are true singers,
but that maniac, Frank Farian, would never allow us to express
ourselves.''
   ``We were afraid for two years that this day would come,''
Pilatus said. ``We've cried about it sometimes ... But deep inside,
we wanted it to happen.'' Pilatus said he and Morvan planned to
sing on their next album.
   The revelation didn't bother Arista, the label that raked in the
cash when ``Girl You Know It's True'' topped the charts.
   ``Seven million albums? Embarrassing?'' asked Roy Lott, vice
president for operations. ``I don't mean the end justifies the
means. But we sold 7 million albums.''
   According to Farian, the idea to hire Rob and Fab as front men
for the band came to him when the pair arrived at his studio in
Germany shortly after the recording of ``Girl You Know It's True.''
   ``It suddenly clicked in my mind, and it was kind of evident: I
had the music, there were the people who wanted to perform
outside,'' said Farian. ``And I said, ``Hey, let's put that
together and make a great record out of it.'''
   Lott said the label is unconcerned about the dupe, and it plans
to distribute Farian's new album.
   As for Rob and Fab, their future's a bit more uncertain.
   ``We are purely their distributor. We do not have a specific
deal with Rob or Fab,'' Lott said.
   The Los Angele Times said sources have suggested that a Dallas
native, Charles Shaw, was one of the singers on the Milli Vanilli
albums. In a telephone interview from Germany, Shaw told the Times,
``once you hear me sing and then you have the Milli Vanilli record
in your hand, even if I told you it wasn't me singing, you wouldn't
believe me.''
   ``Do I resent that Milli Vanilli made so much money and all I
got was studio fee? In the beginning I was very, very upset ...,''
Shaw said. ``But I put it to the side, and at the present moment I
plan to succeed on my own.''

<HEAD>National Council of Churches Demands U.S. Pull Out of Persian Gulf</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The National Council of Churches has
demanded that the United States pull its troops out of the Persian
Gulf and work for a peaceful settlement of the Iraq-Kuwait crisis.
   The only troops that should stay in the region are those whose
presence is requested by the United Nations, the council said in a
resolution adopted unanimously Thursday at the group's convention.
   ``We stand at a unique moment in human history, when all around
us seemingly impregnable walls are being broken down and deep
historical enmities are being healed,'' the council said. ``And
yet, ironically, at such a moment our own nation seems to be poised
at the brink of war in the Middle East.''
   The council also called on Iraq to release all foreign citizens
held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait and to withdraw its troops from
Kuwait.
   It said President Bush and the Congress should use every means
to reach a peaceful settlement, including direct negotiations with
Iraq.
   The council represents about 42 million Americans from 32
denominations, including many of the nation's largest mainstream
Christian churches.
   Also Thursday, the group decried family violence as sin and
called on Christian communities to actively protect women and
children from victimization. At the same time, the council
confessed that past ``inaction by church leadership has sustained
the injustice of family violence.''
   Family violence is an epidemic in Western, post-industrial
societies, where it is considered a birthright by some men, the
statement said. In some cases, it said, ``even interpretations of
scripture'' support the notion of males' right to control and
chastise others.

   China announced today that it will devalue its
currency nearly 10 percent beginning this weekend, the country's
second devaluation in less than a year.
   The State Administration of Exchange Control said the 9.57
percent devaluation will be effective Saturday, according to the
official Xinhua News Agency.
   As usual, Xinhua waited until after the close of the banking day
to make the announcement, and officials could not immediately be
reached for comment.
   Xinhua quoted the State Administration of Exchange Control as
saying the devaluation is part of the effort to ``deepen the
country's economic and monetary reform and accelerate economic
development.''
   The last devaluation took place in December 1989 and was by 21.2
percent.
   Currently, the old buying price is 4.71 yuan to the dollar, and
the selling price is 4.73 yuan. After the devaluation Saturday, it
will cost 5.21 yuan to buy one dollar, and the selling price will
be 5.24 yuan.
   Countries usually devalue their currency to make their products
cheaper on world markets and improve their trade balance. However,
China has been enjoying a large trade surplus due to stringent
import controls.
   China's currency, which is not convertible on world money
markets, is widely believed to be overvalued. The new rate is still
slightly below that used on the black market.

<HEAD>Suspected IRA Bomber Ends 37-Day Hunger Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suspected IRA bomber reportedly had his first
meal today after 37 days on a hunger strike.
   The Home Office, which oversees Britain's prisons, refused to
confirm that Desmond Ellis had eaten, but said no prisoner in the
London prison system was on a hunger strike.
   Desmond's father, Noel Ellis, said his son would end his strike
today.
   The younger Ellis had refused food to protest his extradition
from Ireland to Britain, where he faces trial on charges arising
from a 1981 Irish Republican Army bombing campaign that killed
three people.
   The Supreme Court of Ireland ruled Wednesday that the
38-year-old television engineer culd be extradited to Britain and
Ellis was flown immediately to London.
   Noel Ellis said he visited his son Thursday in south London's
Brixton Prison.
   ``My son has been on hunger strike now for 37 days in an attempt
to prevent his extradition to this country where he will face the
same system and the same courts which sentenced the Guildford Four
and the Birmingham Six to imprisonment,'' Noel Ellis told
reporters.
   Four people, known as the Guildford Four, were released in
October 1989, after prosecutors told the Court of Appeal that
police had lied about some evidence in the case.
   The Home Office, responsible for law and order, recently ordered
a new appeal hearing for six men jailed for two Birmingham pub
bombings in 1974, because of evidence that police may have
falsified some evidence in that case.
   Ellis is the first IRA suspect to be extradited under Ireland's
1987 extradition law.
   Extradition has been a contentious issue between Britain and
Ireland. Under the previous law, some suspects wanted in Britain
have beaten extradition by arguing that their alleged offenses were
``political.''
   Ellis has already served a six-year jail term in Ireland for
possessing explosives.
   The IRA is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland. It wants
to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the 95 percent
Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland, under a socialist government.

   A security guard pleaded innocent to arson in
the Universal Studios backlot fire, and his lawyer said the man is
``very, very distraught'' and may have a mental disability.
   Michael John Huston, 40, acknowledged his name but did not speak
during a brief arraignment Thursday. Municipal Judge Candace Beeson
set his next court appearance for Dec. 13 and ordered him held on
$300,000 bail.
   Huston's grandmother and mother both have told reporters that he
admitted to them he had started the fire. The grandmother, Dorothy
Montanari, quoted Huston as saying, ``You saw the fire on TV; I did
it and I'm going to jail.''
   Outside court, his attorney, Charles English, said he was
investigating the reports about a mental problem stemming from
service in the Vietnam War.
   ``There are a lot of different levels of mental disability,'' he
said. ``We'll have to look at all of Michael's states and see
what's going on.'' He described Huston as ``very, very
distraught.''
   ``He's anxious to get this moving and find out the evidence
against him,'' English said.
   Deputy District Attorney Jane Blissert said witnesses have
placed Huston at the fire scene shortly after it started. She
responded to questions about his sanity by saying, ``He has the
mental capacity to commit these crimes.''
   She said investigators determined the fire was sparked by an
open flame such as a match or cigarette lighter.
   The Nov. 6 blaze wiped out three acres of film history,
destroying make-believe streets and facades which served as
backdrops for movies including ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Back to the
Future'' and ``Dirty Harry.'' It also damaged parts of the
Universal Studios Tour, the third most popular tourist attraction
in the nation.
   Blissert said she didn't know what motive Huston might have had
for setting the fire.
   Huston was an employee of Burns International Security Services,
a New Jersey company that has a contract with Universal. He had
been on the job one month when the fire occurred, the studio said.

<HEAD>Soviet Envoy Urges Linking Iraqi Withdrawal To Palestinian
Question</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's top Middle East negotiator
says the world community must try to avoid war in the Persian Gulf
by agreeing to a conference on the Palestinian question if Iraq
withdraws from Kuwait.
   Yevgeny Primakov, a member of the Presidential Council that
advises Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, reiterated the
Kremlin's desire to avoid a military conflict in the Persian Gulf.
   At a news conference in New York Thursday, he said Saddam
Hussein should be given the opportunity for a ``face-saving''
withdrawal from Kuwait.
   The United States is expected to circulate a U.N. Security
Council resolution by the end of November that would authorize
force to drive Iraq from Kuwait, diplomats said Thursday.
   But in an interview with The New York Times, Primakov said on
Thursday that the Security Council should not be pushed into
adopting such a resolution while negotiations with Iraq are being
pursued.
   Iraq invaded its small, oil-rich neighbor on Aug. 2 in a dispute
over oil, money and land. Iraq later annexed Kuwait and sent its
army to occupy it.
   Primakov, who has made two trips to Baghdad to meet with Iraqi
officials, spoke before receiving an award from the Citizens
Exchange Council for promoting better U.S.-Soviet relatons.
   In a later speech to the council, he proposed a ``flexible
linkage'' between Iraq's withdrawal and a conference to resolve the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute. ``We could inform him about our
intentions to take steps toward an international conference,'' he
said.
   Saddam has demanded that a withdrawal from Kuwait be linked to
establishment of a Palestinain homeland. President Bush has
rejected placing specific conditions for an Iraqi withdrawal but
said other issues could be discussed after a pullout.
   As part of arranging a political solution to the gulf crisis,
Primakov also proposed establishing a ``scheme of regional
security'' that would include limits on Iraq's chemical weapons
arsenal and the withdrawal of the U.S.-led multinational military
force opposing Iraq.
   Bush recently has bolstered U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, saying
the troops must be capable of launching an offensive. U.S.
officials say they intend to add about 200,000 soldiers to the
230,000 already there.
   The Soviet Union in the past has indicated it might approve of
military action against Iraqi forces under a U.N. command if
peaceful measures fail.
   But Primakov said on Thursday that ``we must do everything
possible to force a withdrawal ... everything in our power for a
political solution.
   ``The alternative is a military solution that would have
terrible consequences,'' not only in loss of life but in further
destabilizing the region, he said.

   Seven people headed today for Iraq where they
planned to set up peace camps on both sides of the Kuwaiti-Saudi
border in an effort to prevent fighting from breaking out.
   ``We are well aware of the consequences of our actions, but this
is a point of principle in the traditions of Gandhi,'' said Pat
Arrowsmith, a 60-year-old peace campaigner who left with the group
for Amman, Jordan.
   ``The military forces will have to cross our camps and may even
kill us if they want to fight,'' she said.
   Miss Arrowsmith said Iraqi authorities had told the group it
would be welcome in Baghdad.
   The campaigners hope to set up camp sites on both sides of the
border of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, where U.S. forces
and troops from 25 other nations have assembled since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of the emirate.
   The 300,000 strong force - which includes 230,000 American
soldiers - faces 460,000 Iraqis deployed in Kuwait and southern
Iraq.
   ``It is our intention to select sites in key points which will
prevent the movement of war material and forces,'' said Miss
Arrowsmith.
   She said that other peace protesters, including former pop
singer Cat Stevens - now known as Yusuf Islam - would join them
once the camps were established.
   ``We don't know how many people will eventually be present, but
it could be hundreds. It is a very strong peace movement,'' she
said.
   The activists were identified as Arrowsmith of Britain, Jean
Dreze of Belgium, Bela Bhatia of India, Bassam Fattal of Ghana,
Richard Crump of Britain, John Steel of Britain and a fourth Briton
of Lebanese origin identified only as Sa'adAllah.

   Simon &amp; Schuster's decision not to publish a
novel containing graphic scenes of violence has opened the door for
other publishers who have expressed interest in the book, the
author's representative said.
   Publicist Amanda Urban said she was negotiating with several
other publishers interested in Bret Easton Ellis' latest novel,
``American Psycho.'' She would not elaborate.
   The publishing house announced Wednesday it was canceling plans
to print Ellis' third novel.
   Ellis, 26, said Simon &amp; Schuster last-minute decision not to
publish the novel, which depicts a serial killer who mutilates
women, amounted to censorship. He accused the publishing house of
bowing to pressure from its parent, Paramount Communications Inc.
   Simon &amp; Schuster spokeswoman Barbara Reno said the company would
not comment on Ellis' charges.
   Ellis said the decision means the end of his relationship with
Simon &amp; Schuster, which published his previous novels, ``Less Than
Zero'' and ``The Rules of Attraction.''
   Chairman Richard E. Snyder told The Washington Post he learned
of the violent contents of the book only recently and said editors
who bought it made ``an incorrect decision.''
   ``It was I who decided we should not put our name on this book.
It's a matter of taste,'' Snyder said. He said he was not pressured
by Paramount.
   Ellis rejected Snyder's explanation.
   ``I think it would have been a matter of taste if this had been
raised or discussed 12 months ago ... not after jackets were
printed up, the book typeset, 250 bound galleys made,'' he said.
   ``American Psycho'' had a January publication date and was
scheduled to be shipped to stores next month.
   The book, which includes graphic passages of women being
dismembered and cannibalized, was criticized recently in Spy and
Time magazines.
   Ellis said the reviews ``verged on the hysterical'' and focused
on 40 pages of the 400-page novel.
   ``I think it distorted what the book is really about and in some
strange way gave the impression that I was endorsing this kind of
violence, which if you read the book is clearly not the case,'' he
said.
   Urban said Ellis gets to keep his advance. A source involved
with the contract, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
advance was $300,000.

   Daniel Ortega today likened the U.S.
military buildup in the Persian Gulf to the U.S. invasions of
Grenada and Panama and accused Washington of applying a double
standard when it comes to human rights.
   The former Nicaraguan president criticized the United States for
backing U.N. resolutions in support of occupied Kuwait, while doing
little to enforce resolutions calling for Israel to withdraw from
occupied territories.
   ``How come for them human rights apply to some people but not
the others?'' asked Ortega, who arrived Wednesday on a four-day
visit.
   ``There have been scores of (U.N.) resolutions on Israel's
occupation of Paestinian land. These resolutions should be
implemented too if there is to be a comprehensive settlement in the
region.''
   The official Iraqi News Agency reported earlier that Ortega
supported Saddam Hussein's proposal Aug. 12 for a simultaneous
settlement of his invasion of Kuwait and the Israeli occupation of
Palestinian territories.
   The United States, which leads a multinational force of more
than 350,000 troops arrayed against Iraq since its Aug. 2 invasion,
rejected the linkage.
   Ortega's criticism of the United States was expected. Washington
supported the Contra reels who fought Ortega's leftist Sandinista
government throughout most of the 1980s. Ortega was defeated in
February elections by a presidential candidate supported by the
United States.
   Speaking of the U.S. gulf deployment, Ortega said: ``My country
has suffered from the same policy when they tried to undermine the
Sandinistas.''
   Referring to the 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada and the 1989
invasion of Panama, he said: ``The invasion of Grenada and the
intervention in Panama are also other examples of the policy of
hegemony.''
   On Friday, Ortega met with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and
National Assembly Speaker Sadi Mehdi Saleh, the Iraqi News Agency
reported. It said Saleh told Ortega that Iraq wants the gulf crisis
resolved peacefully.
   ``But if the forces of evil attempt to ignite war, then Iraq
will be forced to fight back,'' the agency quoted Saleh as saying.
   It said during his two separate meetings with Saleh and Aziz,
Ortega expressed support of Iraq in its drive to ``liberate the
region from American hegemony.''
   Ortega met on Thursday with Saddam. Baghdad television said they
discussed Third World countries that are ``trying to combat U.S.
hegemony.''

<TEXT>
   Reporters withheld their bylines today in a
show of unity as an evening strike deadline neared at the San
Francisco Bay area's three biggest daily newspapers.
   Talks between the San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco
Examiner and San Jose Mercury News and about a dozen unions
representing 4,500 employees recessed late Thursday and were
scheduled to resume early today.
   The two sides took up wages Thursday after agreeing on
non-economic issues at the newspapers, which have a combined
circulation of more than 1 million. The unions threatened to strike
at 5 p.m. if a new contract is not reached.
   Workers represented by the newspapers' unions include reporters
and editors, drivers and press operators. Most of the unions'
contracts expired in February.
   The Newspaper Guild, which represents the reporters, asked
members to begin withholding their bylines from stories today, and
practically all writers' names were gone from early editions of the
San Francisco Chronicle.
   Among those missing was Herb Caen, whose popular and
idiosyncratic column has appeared in San Francisco papers for more
than 50 years. There was little chance readers would fail to
recognize his whimsical style and skyline logo.
   ``My name doesn't appear at the top of this column today because
there's talk of a newspaper strike and we scribblers are showing
our solidarity and our dedication to the Guild by withholding our
most precious possessions, our bylines,'' Caen wrote at the bottom
of the column. ``If you didn't notice, good for you.''
   The unions are seeking raises of 20 percent. The top scale pay
for reporters at all three papers is $800 per week.
   The 20 percent request ``was high, but you've got to start
somewhere,'' said Doug Cuthbertson, chairman of the union umbrella
organization.
   Richard Jordan, chief negotiator for the San Francisco Newspaper
Agency, which prints the Chronicle and Examiner, would not indicate
how much of an increase it was willing to provide.
   Neil Chethik, chairman of the Newspaper Guild for the Mercury
News, said the unions set a strike deadline just before the holiday
season on purpose.
   ``Our leverage on the newspaper is the holiday season, when ad
revenues are usually up,'' he said.
   The morning Chronicle, with weekday circulation of about
560,000, publishes jointly with the Examiner on Sunday for a
combined circulation of about 725,000. The afternoon Examiner has a
weekday circulation of about 138,000.
   The San Jose Mercury News has a weekday circulation of about
275,000 and a Sunday circulation of about 329,000.

<TEXT>
   About 150 protesters camped out on the
front lawn of the University of Michigan's president after 16
people were arrested at a sit-in against the school's plans for an
armed campus police force.
   After Thursday's arrests at the administration building, the
demonstrators camped out overnight on the lawn of President James
Duderstadt's campus residence. Most were gone by daybreak today.
   ``This campus is ours,'' protest leader Corey Dolgon told the
crowd early today. ``We're not giving it back.''
   Organizers called for a boycott of classes Monday.
   The 16 demonstrators were arrested late Thursday afternoon after
refusing to vacate the Fleming Administration Building. They had
held the sit-in outside Duderstadt's office since Wednesday.
   ``The police came in and said, `We have a warrant for
trespassing. You have five minutes.' Those who had legal defense
and bail money stayed. Those who didn't left,'' said student Jeff
Anderson.
   During the arrests, a university security officer suffered a
fractured hand, Public Safety Director Leo Heatley said.
   The protest was staged by a group calling itself Students for a
Safer Campus. The group objects to campus police who carry guns,
saying they would present a danger to students.
   The school's board of regents voted in June to hire a campus
police force rather than rely on Ann Arbor for police protection.
   Eight officers are in training and are expected to begin work
early net year. The force will expand to 24 over three years,
university spokesman Joseph Owsley said.
   Walter Harrison, executive director of university relations,
said the arrests were regrettable but unavoidable after the
students rejected a request to leave the building and meet with
university officials after Thanksgiving.
   ``There was no hope of negotiating a way out,'' he said.

   Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar's
6-day-old government won a vote of confidence in Parliament today,
ending weeks of political uncertainty fanned by sectarian violence.
   The 522-member, decision-making lower house of Parliament voted
269-204 in Chandra Shekhar's favor, formally endorsing his
elevation to head of government. Fifteen legislators abstained and
the rest were absent.
   The vote was taken after an acrimonious seven-hour debate
between supporters of V.P. Singh, whom Chandra Shekhar replaced as
prime minister last week, and supporters of the new government.
   ``A new political climate has to be created,'' Chandra Shekhar
said before the vote. ``Let us stop calling each other names. At
this moment we should try to agree to work together. I want
everybody's cooperation.''
   Singh was brought down amid political and religious conflicts.
   About 390 people have been killed across India over the past
four weeks in Hindu-Moslem riots and clashes between police and
Hindu fundamentalists seeking to build a temple on a site in
northeast India already occupied by a mosque.
   Six people were killed in New Delhi on Wednesday, the first time
the current wave of religious violence has struck the capital, when
Moslems and Sikhs clashed with Hindus.
   Singh lost a vote of confidence Nov. 7 after Chandra Shekhar led
a breakaway faction of the governing Janata Dal party and joined
hands with the Congress Party of former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi.
   The dissident faction of the Janata Dal, called the Janata
Dal-Socialist, has barely 10 percent of seats in Parliament. But
the backing of Gandhi's Congress Party, which has the support of
210 members in the legislature, ensured the majority.
   Gandhi said he wished Chandra Shekhar well in his post. ``He has
got a difficult task in dealing with the mess left by V.P. Singh's
government,'' he told reporters outside Parliament.
   Earlier, Chandra Shekhar told Parliament he had no regrets in
seeking Gandhi's support for ensuring his survival.
   In the debate, their alliance was denounced across the political
spectrum. ``It is a mockery and debasement of democratic norms ...
a two-headed monster with no body and limbs,'' said Somnath
Chatterjee of the Left Front, an alliance of communist and
socialist parties.
   Lal Krishna Advani, leader of the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya
Janata Party, accused Chandra Shekhar of abandoning the voters who
ousted Gandhi's Congress Party from power in general elections less
than a year ago.
   ``This government lacks political legitimacy,'' said Advani,
whose party brought down the last government by withdrawing support
for Singh.
   So far, the government is composed of only two men: Chandra
Shekhar and his deputy prime minister, Devi Lal. No other Cabinet
ministers have been announced.

<TEXT>
   The first major U.S.-Saudi
Arabian military exercise, with the ominous name ``Imminent
Thunder,'' began its second day today shrouded in secrecy.
   By military standards the six-day exercise, including a mock
amphibious invasion, is relatively small. But its name and the
sudden announcement that it was already under way heightened its
importance at a time of uncertainty in the Persian Gulf.
   Before the exercise started, Iraq on Wednesday denounced it as
``a clear act of provocation'' close to the Iraqi border that
demonstrated ``America's aggressive intentions.''
   The name Imminent Thunder raised speculation about whether a
real military operation was imminent. This was reinforced by the
recent prediction in a French magazine that an offensive would be
launched on Nov. 17, the first moonless night after the U.S.
elections.
   U.S. Navy spokesman Cmdr. J.D. Van Sickle said the exercise was
not intended to provoke the Iraqis and insisted the name had no
particular significance.
   ``The purpose is to give participating forces training in joint
and combined operations and to enhance amphibious warfare skills,''
he said. ``Exercise Imminent Thunder is part of our Desert Shield
training.''
   Pentagon Spokesman Pete Williams said Thursday the main
amphibious landing exercise was being held about 100 miles south of
the Kuwaiti border. He also said that as part of Imminent Thunder a
smaller group of Marines was conducting a training exercise about
25 miles south of the emirate's frontier.
   Approximately 1,000 U.S. Marines, 1,100 aircraft and 16 ships,
including the aircraft carrier USS Midway which arrived in the
region earlier this month, are participating in the exercise along
with an unspecified number of Saudi forces.
   Training will consist of the amphibious landing, expected
Sunday, with air cover and close air and naval support of ground
forces. No live ammunition is to be fired.
   The exercise began under a news blackout but the military said
pool media coverage was being planned for the weekend.
   The participants represent about 1 percent of the 230,000
Americans and 100,000 servicemen from 25 other countries deployed
in the gulf following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Nonetheless, it is the largest use of aircraft in a single
training exercise in Operation Desert Shield. It is also the first
mock amphibious assault in Saudi Arabia following three previous
exercises in neighboring Oman and Bahrain.
   If Desert Shield is to be effective, either defensively or
offensively, its numerous Arab and Western military contingents
must be coordinated effectively.
   Only two weeks ago, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia agreed on command and control of all
troops.
   Inside the kingdom, there is now joint U.S.-Saudi command.
Outside the kingdom, the United States will command its own forces
but it must receive the king's permission to launch an attack from
Saudi soil.
   President Bush has said he wants to wait for U.N. trade
sanctions against Iraq to force Baghdad out of Kuwait but he has
also voiced impatience with President Saddam Hussein's
intransigence.
   Bush, who will visit troops on Thanksgiving Day, recently
doubled the number of U.S. aircraft carriers in the gulf region to
six. He is also sending 200,000 additional military personnel to
give Desert Shield an offensive capability.
   Earlier this week, British Defense Secretary Tom King and
Abdullah Bishara, secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation
Council, also warned Iraq there was a limit to the patience of the
allied forces.
   The exercise includes units of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force
and 1,000 members of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Battalion as well
as the Royal Saudi Air Force, and naval and marine units.
   Staff Sgt. Maceo Wylie, 42, of Columbia, S.C., with the Army's
528th Medical (Psychological) Detachment, said it was important for
the allies to train together ``because that's the only time you
know who you can rely on in combat.''
   But Army 1st Sgt. Mickey Kershaw, 37, of West Islip, N.Y., said
the exercise was ``a waste of time.'' He said it would be far
better to attack Saddam now ``than do it five years from now when
this guy nukes me and the family I might have.''

   U.S. and Saudi troops backed by hundreds of planes staged
maneuvers near the Kuwaiti border today, and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III was in Europe for talks that will include the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   President Bush leaves today to join Baker for further
discussions with allies, then spend Thanksgiving with U.S. soldiers
in Saudi Arabia. It would be the first presidential visit to
front-line troops since the Vietnam war.
  Iraqi President Saddam Hussein suggested a peaceful solution was
still possible and indicated he could release Western hostages if
Bush promised not to attack Iraq, an offer the United States has
rejected before.
   U.S. officials were gauging international reaction to a possible
U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force to drive Iraq
from Kuwait. Some diplomats said the resolution could come by the
end of the month.
   The Soviet Union's top Middle East envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, told
The New York Times on Thursday the introduction of such a
resolution should be delayed to give time for talks on a
``face-saving'' Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. He said those talks
could include discussion of the Palestinian question.
   About 1,000 U.S. troops and an unknown number of Saudi soldiers
were taking part in the six-day ``Imminent Thunder'' maneuvers,
which began Thursday. Also involved were about 1,100 aircraft and
16 ships, including the aircraft carrier USS Midway. No live
ammunition was to be used.
   The Iraqis denounced the exercise as ``a clear act of
provocation,'' but a U.S. Navy spokesman, Cmdr. J.D. Van Sickle,
said it was purely for training. He said the code name had no
particular significance.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said on Thursday the main
amphibious landing exercise - expected Sunday - would be held about
100 miles south of the Kuwaiti border. He said also under Imminent
Thunder a smaller group of Marines was conducting a training
exercise about 25 miles south of the Kuwaiti border.
   Bush is scheduled to travel to Europe and the Mideast on the
eight-day trip. He is to spend Thanksgiving in Saudi Arabia, base
for the 300,000-strong multinational force deployed against Iraq
after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The last U.S. president to visit front-line forces was Lyndon
Johnson during the Vietnam war in 1967.
   In a Cable News Network interview Thursday, Bush said he wanted
to send a signal to Saddam that ``we are deadly serious'' about
getting Iraq out of Kuwait.
   Before heading to the Middle East, Bush was to meet on the gulf
crisis with leaders of the Soviet Union, Britain and France at a
three-day Paris gathering of the 34-nation Conference on Security
and European Cooperation.
   In particular, U.S. officials said Bush planned to sound out
members of the 15-member U.N. Security Council on the wording of a
proposed resolution to authorize force against Iraq.
   An aide to Baker said the United States would like to introduce
the resolution this month while its diplomat still presides over
the council. Yemen, a pro-Iraqi council member, will hold the
presidency for December.
   Baker was in Brussels, Belgium, today for trade talks with
representatives from the 12-nation European Economic Community.
Also on the agenda was aid to Jordan, Turkey and Egypt, which have
suffered most under the U.N.-backed trade embargo against Iraq.
   Saddam, meanwhile, said Iraq still seeks a peaceful solution.
   ``Iraq, for its part, sees that the right way to go is the
course for peace, and that peace should be comprehensive, complete
and final,'' Saddam said in an ABC-TV interview broadcast Thursday.
   But Saddam made no peace proposals and also said that ``whoever
hits us, we shall hit them back.'' Saddam has said that any peace
talks must also cover Israel's occupation of lands claimed by
Palestinians.
   Primakov, in a speech Thursday in New York, said the world
should do ``everything possible'' to encourage Iraq to leave
Kuwait, including holding an international conference that would
address the Palestinian question.
   Some relatives of American hostages say they plan to take
Saddam's offer to visit Iraq during he holiday season. State
Department officials said the U.S. government has advised against
the trips.
   Hundreds of Westerners are being held in Iraq and Kuwait, some
at strategic sites to deter attack by the multinational force
deployed against Iraq.
   More than 100 Americans and their foreign-born family members
were to leave Kuwait on Sunday aboard a U.S.-chartered Iraqi
Airways flight, the State Department said Thursday. Most were women
and children who have been eligible to leave for some time but
decided only recently to depart, said a State Department spokesman,
Richard Boucher.
   Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna said
today that Iraq has invited inspectors to verify that it is not
developing weapons at its four nuclear research sites.
   The unexpected move was clearly designed to forestall attack on
the ground that Iraq is working toward nuclear capability. Iraq has
repeatedly denied allegations by Western media and Israel that it
is developing nuclear weapons.
   Iraq's representative to the U.N.-supported agency said three
weeks ago that ``the doors were open'' for a routine inspection,
agency spokesman Hans-Friedrich Meyer said. No date was announced.
   Also today, seven anti-war activists left London for Baghdad
hoping to set up camps on both sides of the Saudi-Kuwait border.
The group said it intended to disrupt any battles that might break
out. Former pop singer, Cat Stevens - now known as Yusuf Islam -
was to join them later, the group said.

   Rising energy prices hit American consumers
for the third straight month in October, pushing inflation up a
sharp 0.6 percent, the government reported today.
   The 0.6 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index followed jumps
of 0.8 percent in both August and September.
   That means that in the three months since Iraq invaded Kuwait,
inflation has risen at an annual rate of 8.9 percent, the fastest
three-month advance since 1982, the Labor Department said. During
all of last year, inflation rose 4.6 percent.
   However, analysts noted that the inflation rate for products not
related to energy rose a modest 0.3 percent. Many economists see
this so-called core rate a better indication of inflation.
   Economists said the downturn in the U.S. economy - many analysts
think a recession has gripped the economy - is holding down prices
except for oil.
   ``The sliding economy is preventing the oil and energy shock
from causing a runaway on inflation,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist at the Boston Co.
   ``There's a hint here that we may get through this inflationary
shock from oil in reasonably good shape, but only at the cost of a
sharp downturn in the economy keeping inflation from getting out of
hand,'' Sinai said.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed 3.3
percent in September, the first improvement since June, the
government reported today. But petroleum imports were at their
highest level in nine years because of escalating costs due to the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   The Commerce Department said imports dropped 2.4 percent to
$41.3 billion despite a huge 28.5 percent jump in petroleum
imports. But exports also fell, down 2.2 percent to $31.8 billion.
The deficit is the difference between the two.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, plunged 2.1
percent in October. It was the largest decline since a 2.3 percent
drop in April 1979.
   Average weekly earnings in October before adjusting for
inflation were $349.85, up from $341.39 a year earlier. Taking the
6.2 percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over the
12-month period, real weekly earnings were down 3.5 percent.
   As in the previous two months, the government blamed almost all
of October's inflation jolt on spiraling energy prices.
   Private analysts have been concerned that the fallout from the
turmoil in the Persian Gulf would deepen any recession.
   ``It's taking money out of people's pocketbooks ... They don't
have enough purchasing power'' to boost sales and keep the nation's
economy moving, said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic
forecasting at Georgia State University.
   Today's inflation report showed that fuel oil shot up 12.8
percent in October, putting those prices 50.8 percent higher than
they were before the Iraqi invasion.
   Gasoline jumped 7.7 percent in October, bringing those prices to
26.9 percent higher than they were three months ago. So far this
year, gasoline has jumped 36.9 percent and the government's
so-called gasoline index is now well above its previous peak level
of 1981.
   The 8.9 percent spurt in all consumer prices for August-October
was the fastest three-month rise since prices shot up 10.9 percent
for the period ending in July 1982, the government said.
   Analysts expect that inflation - without an eruption of a
shooting war in the Persian Gulf - will return to more normal
levels in coming months as oil prices stabilize.
   ``If oil prices do not go up, one can expect the inflation fire
to basically be out by next spring,'' Sinai said.
   Still, the oil shock could persist, though not as dramatically,
as costs filter through to the thousands of other energy-related
products such as chemicals, plastics and air fare.
   On Thursday, President Bush brought business leaders to the
White House to discuss the nation's current economic problems and
possible ways to ease the pain of any economic downturn. Similar
meetings were scheduled today before Bush's Thanksgiving trip to
Europe and Saudi Arabia.
   So far this year, Americans' cost of living has risen 6.7
percent, well above the 4.7 percent inflation registered for the
similar 10-month period last year, the government said.
   In October, food costs rose 0.4 percent, double the 0.2 percent
increase of September, the government said. A slight drop in fruit
and vegetable prices was more than offset by larger increases for
other grocery store products, such as meats, poultry and eggs.
   Clothing costs were down 0.2 percent as prices fell for men,
women and children, but footwear was up 0.1 percent.
   Medical care prices jumped 0.8 percent, following similar sharp
increases in both August and September. Those prices are now 9.4
percent higher than they were a year ago.
   New car prices increased 0.5 percent in October while housing
costs were up 0.3 percent, today's report showed.
   The various changes in today's report put the index for all
consumer items at 133.5 in October. That means a hypothetical
selection of goods and services that cost $100 in the 1982-84 base
period cost $133.50 last month, up from $125.60 a year earlier.

<HEAD>Woodrow Wilson's Name Restored on Prague Train Station</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-two years after Communists
removed Woodrow Wilson's name from Prague's main train station, the
government restored it today, in honor of President Bush's visit.
   Bush's one-day visit to Prague on Saturday, the first by a U.S.
president, coincides with the first anniversary of Czechoslovakia's
``Velvet Revolution.'' The term describes the mass street protests
that ended 40 years of Communist rule and restored democracy with
former dissident Vaclav Havel as president.
   Wilson's government was a leading supporter of Czech and Slovak
independence from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. He recognized the
sovereignty of a de facto government set up by Tomas G. Masaryk in
U.S. exile before the two peoples joined as an independent
Czechoslovakia in 1918.
   Masaryk became Czechoslovakia's first president that year.
Wilson's support of Czechoslovak independence established warm
relations between the two nations and Prague's main train station,
a glass-domed building near central Wenceslas Square, was named
after Wilson to thank him.
   After the Communists took power in 1948, Wilson's name was
dropped and the terminal became simply the Main Station.
   Prague Mayor Jaroslav Koran said at a brief ceremony today that
``Wilson's station never stopped being Wilson's station...even when
frightened (Communist) rulers tried to wipe out'' the reference.
   ``Wilson has returned to Prague, where he always belonged, but
never visited,'' Koran said, adding that Bush's visit would
``complete the magic circle. As if with a message from our
ancestors, the president will visit for the first time ever.''
   U.S. Ambassador Shirley Temple Black, outlining the special
relationship between Wilson and Masaryk, said the station was
originally named after Wilson to show the recognition of
Czechoslovakia as a world country.''
   Bush is returning a visit made to the United States by Havel in
February. He was the first Czechoslovak president to visit America
officially.
   After the Czech lands were occupied by Hitler's army in 1939,
President Eduard Benes made a private visit to the United States
from exile in Britain. During the Communist era, America was viewed
as a beacon of freedom, and Czechoslovaks' unabated warm feelings
toward the United States are evident on the eve of Bush's visit.
   A simple white plaque unveiled at the ceremony bears a
photograph of Wilson and the inscription, ``On the occasion of the
first visit of an American president to Czechoslovakia, this
station has been renamed the Woodrow Wilson Station.''
   A 71-year-old woman was clearly pleased with the formal
renaming.
   ``That is what it was during the first republic and we are
comfortable with it,'' she said.

   Sen. Alan Cranston actively solicited
contributions from savings and loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. at
times when Keating wanted help with federal banking regulators, the
Senate Ethics Committee's chief counsel charged today.
   ``On approximately four separate occasions Senator Cranston
accepted or solicited several hundred thousand dollars from Mr.
Keating'' for his campaigns or voter registration drives to which
he was closely associated, said counsel Robert S. Bennett.
   Each of those contributions was linked ``by time and
circumstances with a request by Mr. Keating'' for action with
federal bank regulators, Bennett said.
   Bennett outlined the case against Cranston on the second day of
the committee's hearings into the links between five senators and
Keating, whose Lincoln Savings and Loan failed at an estimated cost
to taxpayers of $2 billion.
   But before he began, Cranston's lawyer asked that one of the six
committee members, Sen. Jesse Helms, be barred from judging the
California Democrat.
   Helms, speaking under oath, stoutly denied the charge by
Cranston attorne William W. Taylor III that he had already made up
his mind in the case. He refused to step aside.
   Taylor's request provided a dramatic start to the second day of
hearings into the Keating Five, and reflected the political
tensions involved as the Senate panel sits in judgment on five
prominent lawmakers.

   About 150 protesters camped out on the
front lawn of the University of Michigan's president after 16
people were arrested at a sit-in against the school's plans for an
armed campus police force.
   After Thursday's arrests at the administration building, the
demonstrators camped out overnight on the lawn of President James
Duderstadt's campus residence. Most were gone by daybreak today.
   ``This campus is ours,'' protest leader Corey Dolgon told the
crowd early today. ``We're not giving it back.''
   Meanwhile, in Cambridge, Mass., 25 students spent the night
inside Harvard University's main administration building while
others slept outside in a protest seeking a stronger commitment to
African-American studies.
   The protest inside University Hall in Harvard Yard ended this
morning, and police reported no arrests.
   ``We're not expecting to have six professors tomorrow,'' said
Anthony McLean, a junior Afro-American studies major. ``But we
would like a firm commitment to hire people because that would make
Afro-Am more stable.''
   In Michigan, organizers called for a boycott of classes Monday.
   The 16 demonstrators were arrested late Thursday afternoon after
refusing to vacate the Fleming Administration Building. They had
held the sit-in outside Duderstadt's office since Wednesday.
   ``The police came in and said, `We have a warrant for
trespassing. You have five minutes.' Those who had legal defense
and bail money stayed. Those who didn't left,'' said student Jeff
Anderson.
   During the arrests, a university security officer suffered a
fractured hand, Public Safety Director Leo Heatley said.
   The protest was staged by a group calling itself Students for a
Safer Campus. The group objects to campus police who carry guns,
saying they would present a danger to students.
   The school's board of regents voted in June to hire a campus
police force rather than rely on Ann Arbor for police protection.
   Eight officers are in training and are expected to begin work
early net year. The force will expand to 24 over three years,
university spokesman Joseph Owsley said.
   Walter Harrison, executive director of university relations,
said the arrests were regrettable but unavoidable after the
students rejected a request to leave the building and meet with
university officials after Thanksgiving.
   ``There was no hope of negotiating a way out,'' he said.

   Highlights of speeches to Parliament today by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his chief political
rival, Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POLITICAL, MILITARY CHANGES
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev said that within 10 days he would submit to Parliament
plans to reorganize the government and military leadership, but he
was not specific on the changes he said were needed to ``get rid of
outdated, clearly useless structures.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ANTI-CRISIS COMMITTEE
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Yeltsin demanded the ouster of Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov's
Cabinet and said it should be replaced with an ``anti-crisis
committee'' - apparently a coalition of central government and
republic leaders - to lead the country while moving to a market
economy. He gave Gorbachev two weeks to set it up.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HUNGER
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev criticized ``speculation about approaching hunger and
cold'' this winter, saying the nation has stockpiled food and will
import whatever it needs.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LEADERSHIP CRISIS
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev acknowledged a ``crisis of power'' in the vacuum left
by the Communist Party's diminished influence, noting ``we have not
yet created democratic mechanisms that would meet the new tasks.''
Yeltsin called it ``a crisis of a totalitarian state which is
reflected in the paralysis of power.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NEED FOR PUBLIC SUPPORT
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev said the most competent officials who enjoy broad
public support should join the government because ``without public
confidence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to effect an
anti-crisis policy.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NEED FOR PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Noting that some of his decrees have been reversed by officials
in the republics, Gorbachev appealed for deputies to give him the
support he needs to carry out his reforms, because ``the president
cannot be just on his own .... Let's act together.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POWER STRUGGLE
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev said a power struggle was under way in the nation,
with participants using all means at their disposal to discredit
the state, but he rejected persistent rumors of a military coup.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE COMMUNIST PARTY
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev said that in the past the Communist Party
``infiltrated practically everything - both the state bodies and
public structures.'' Its authoritarian monopoly on power ``was not
only incompatible with democratic principles, but ... led to
colossal losses and flaws as far as the social progress of the
country is concerned. We have consciously dropped it and there is
no way back.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   RIGHTS FOR MILITARY
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev, who met Tuesday with soldiers and heard complaints
about their living conditions, said he would cancel decisions made
by republics and local governments that deny rights to Soviet
soldiers and their families, particularly those in the Baltics. In
some regions, Russian soldiers and dependents have been denied
residence documents needed to buy food in state stores.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   UNION TREATY
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev said the union treaty - the document being drafted
that would redefine the relationship between the central government
and the republics - needs to be concluded as soon as possible to
hold the nation together. ``We cannot reconcile ourselves to
separatists' attempts to turn the union into a flabby entity devoid
of a single will or even to dismember it.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   KREMLIN VS. REPUBLICS
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Noting the conflict between measures implemented by the national
government and the republics, Gorbachev suggested the national
Parliament propose that local legislatures begin a moratorium on
decisions that run counter to those from the central government.
Yeltsin said the Kremlin ``is sliding down to confrontation with
the republics, and first of all, with Russia.''

   Air Force Col. Richard O. Covey,
who has flown twice in space, is commanding his first shuttle
flight aboard Atlantis.
   Covey has been an astronaut since 1978. He was a pilot on two
previous missions, including the first shuttle to fly since the
Challenger disaster.
   He first flew into space aboard Discovery in 1985 on a mission
to deploy three communications satellites. The crew also repaired
an ailing satellite in space.
   Covey, 44, again was a pilot on Discovery in 1988 on the first
post-Challenger mission. The five astronauts deployed a
communications satellite during the flight.
   He was born in Fayetteville, Ark., but considers Fort Walton
Beach, Fla., his hometown.
   After graduating from Choctawhatchee High School in Shalimar,
Fla., he earned a bachelor's degree in engineering sciences from
the Air Force Academy and a master's degree in aeronautics and
astronautics from Purdue.
   Covey flew 339 combat missions in Southeast Asia and was a test
pilot before becoming an astronaut.

   Astronaut Frank L. Culbertson Jr.,
a Navy commander, is making his first trip into space aboard
Atlantis.
   Culbertson, 41, is the pilot on the flight - a secret mission
for the military.
   Selected an astronaut in 1984, Culbertson has since had several
ground assignments at the space agency. He helped redesign and test
the shuttle's nosewheel steering, tires and brakes and has served
as the shuttle communicator in Mission Control on other missions.
   After the Challenger explosion, he worked at NASA headquarters
in Washington, assisting the space agency, the Presidential
Commission and Congress in their investigations into the accident.
   Culbertson was born in Charleston, S.C., but grew up in Holly
Hill, S.C., where he graduated from Holly Hill High School. He
earned a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from the Naval
Academy.
   After graduating from Annapolis, he served aboard the USS Fox in
the Gulf of Tonkin and then went through flight training in
Pensacola, Fla.
   He is married and has three children.

   Marine Col. Robert C. Springer, one
of three mission specialists aboard Atlantis, is a veteran of one
previous shuttle flight.
   Springer, an astronaut for 10 years, was a mission specialist
aboard Discovery on a March 1989 flight. During the five-day
mission, the crew's primary goal was deploying a communications
satellite.
   The 48-year-old astronaut also worked on the final development
of the shuttle's robot arm.
   Born in St. Louis, Springer grew up in Ashland, Ohio, and
graduated from Ashland High School. He earned a bachelor's in naval
science from the Naval Academy and a master's in operations
research and systems analysis from the Naval Postgraduate School.
   He went through basic training for the Marine Corps in Quantico,
Va., before reporting to the Navy Air Training Command for flight
training at Pensacola., Fla., and Beeville, Texas.
   In Vietnam, he flew F-4 aircraft, completing 300 combat
missions. Springer also flew 250 combat missions in helicopters.
   He is married and has three children.

   Atlantis settled into orbit under a
communications blackout after a dazzling night launch of the
Pentagon's last secret shuttle mission. The ship reportedly carried
a spy satellite aimed at Iraq.
   Riding a 700-foot column of yellow flame, the shuttle lifted
from its seaside launch pad at 6:48 p.m. Thursday, climbed smoothly
into darkness, slowly dimmed to a speeding star and then winked
from view more than 350 miles downrange.
   Atlantis' five-member, all-military crew reportedly planned to
release a satellite that will focus cameras or electronic signal
detectors on the Middle East, where American troops stand poised
against Iraq.
   A news blackout has been imposed on the mission, cutting off
public release of communications between the crew and Mission
Control. Only bare status reports will be issued during the
four-day flight.
   As of midday today, all appeared to be going well. ``That we're
not hearing anything means that the orbiter and crew are doing
fine,'' NASA spokeswoman Billie Deason said.
   It was the first flight in eight months for Atlantis, one of two
shuttles grounded during the summer because of hydrogen fuel leaks.
   Mission Control spokesman Jeff Carr described the launch as
``picture-perfect.''
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration chief Richard
Truly said it was ``just about as smooth a countdown and liftoff''
as he has ever seen. ``We've got a good bird, a healthy crew and a
good mission on the way,'' he said.
   The mission is the seventh and final secret military flight
planned for a shuttle. The Air Force has said that unmanned
rockets, principally the Titan 4, will be used in the future to
launch secret spy and communications satellites.
   Col. Frank Stirling, who heads the Titan 4 program, said
unmanned rockets offer greater reliability than NASA's fleet of
three and ultimately four shuttles.
   ``With Titan we have a continuing production line with many
Titans available, so that if we should ever have a problem or an
outage with the vehicle, we would still be able to recover and
continue operations,'' he said.
   The Pentagon will use the shuttle twice in 1991, but both
missions are unclassified.
   Atlantis' crew consists of Air Force Col. Richard Covey, mission
commander; Navy Cmdr. Frank Culbertson Jr., pilot; and Army Maj.
Charles Gemar, Air Force Lt. Col. Carl Meade and Marine Col. Robert
Springer, all mission specialists.
   Although details of Atlantis' mission are military secrets,
published reports have identified the cargo as a satellite that
will conduct either electronic eavesdropping or photo surveys of
the Persian Gulf area, including Iraq. The reports said that while
Atlantis was grounded because of the fuel leaks, the Air Force
satellite was modified for Middle East surveillance.
   Atlantis was the fifth of 37 shuttle flights to be launched in
darkness and the fifth shuttle mission of 1990, a year in which
NASA was plagued with shuttle problems.
   Atlantis and Columbia were grounded after dangerous hydrogen
leaks developed during launch attempts. In trying to solve the
problem, NASA replaced Atlantis' external fuel tank, some plumbing
and valve seals.
   Atlantis and Columbia were cleared for flight last month.
   NASA officials were clearly relieved Thursday night.
   ``It puts Atlantis back into flying status again,'' said launch
director Bob Sieck. ``In a few weeks, we expect to have Columbia
there too. So we'll have all three shuttles flying again.''
   The third shuttle, Discovery, flew last month. Columbia is being
prepared for launch in December.

<TEXT>
   Convicted murderer Lawrencia
Bembenek got permission to marry the man she fled prison with, but
because he's being deported today, it was unlikely they could make
it to a church in time, officials said.
   Officials at the jail where Ms. Bembenek and Dominic Gugliatto
were being held granted permission for the marriage if they could
obtain a license.
   But Thunder Bay City Clerk Harry Kirk said the couple would not
have enough time to get the marriage license before Gugliatto was
deported this afternoon.
   Either Ms. Bembenek, a former model, Milwaukee police officer
and Playboy club waitress, or Gugliatto needed to apply in person
for the license and jail officials could not arrange for the move
on such short notice, Kirk said.
   ``As far as we're concerned, there is no other option,'' Kirk
said.
   The $50 marriage form takes about 15 minutes to complete with
the corresponding paperwork but Ms. Bembenek would need to provide
original court decrees proving her previous divorce, he said.
   Ms. Bembenek, 32, was divorced from former Milwaukee police
detective Elfred Schultz shortly after she was convicted of
murdering Schultz's former wife, Christine Schultz, in 1981.
   She was serving a life prison sentence at a prison near Fond du
Lac, Wis., when she escaped last July and fled to Canada to start a
new life with Gugliatto, 35, a suburban Milwaukee factory worker,
authorities said.
   The couple were recaptured last month after a visitor to Thunder
Bay, a Canadian tourist city just north of Duluth, Minn.,
recognized them from a segment about their escaped aired on the
television show ``America's Most Wanted.''
   Since their capture, the couple has fought deportation to the
United States, where they face escape charges. Gugliatto was
ordered deported this week while a decision for Ms. Bembenek is
pending.
   Once back in the United States, Gugliatto will face charges of
aiding and abetting Bembenek's escape.

   Hundreds of Indonesians were injured
as they fled their homes and schools during an earthquake that
rocked Indonesia's northernmost province, authorities said today.
   The earthquake, measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale, struck
Thursday.
   It damaged hundreds of buildings and caused landslides that
halted traffic between the town of Kutacane in Aceh province and
the remote district of Blang Kejeren, the police said.
   Police said hundreds of area residents were injured when they
ran from their houses in panic. Police did not give precise
figures, and there were no immediate reports on the severity of the
injuries.
   It was the second earthquake to hit Indonesia in two weeks. A
quake measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale jolted the remote mountain
area of Jayawijaya in the easternmost province of Irian Jaya
earlier this month, but there were no reports of damage or
casualties.
   At least 10 buildings, including three mosques, three schools
and the local telephone office and power plant, collapsed in Blang
Kejeren, the area worst hit by the latest quake, according to the
official Antara news agency.
   Blang Kejeren, in the Bukit Barisan mountains, is located 115
miles from the quake's epicenter, which was 845 miles northwest of
Jakarta, according to the meteorological agency.
   Antara quoted the assistant regent of Blang Kejeren, Abdullah
Wirasalihin, as saying the area was jolted 10 times in less than
nine hours, beginning early Thursday morning.
   ``The district town was in a total blackout Thursday might
because the power plant's building was also damaged by the quake,''
according to the news agency, which said landslides occurred in
some villages.
   It said the tremors sent hundreds of school children pouring out
of classrooms, and at least three suffered broken legs when they
were pinned down in the melee.
   Wirasalihin said most residents were afraid to return to their
houses Thursday night, fearing further tremors.

   Police clashed with students at
Swaziland University, injuring 80 of them in a melee that caused
$40,000 in damage, authorities said Friday.
   Four of the students were reported in critical condition,
university officials told the independent South African Press

   The riot Wednesday night involved student grievances over campus
life, including the quality of food.
   Fighting erupted when a group of about 400 refused to leave the
Kwaluseni campus peacefully, erected barricades and smashed
furniture and windows, the government-run South African
Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   Officials have closed the campus indefinitely, the SABC
reported.
   Swaziland is a small mountain kingdom that borders Mozambique

   A survey of blood samples
indicates that as many as 100,000 South Africans may have been
exposed to the AIDS virus, the city health department said Friday.
   Dr. Clive Evians said in an interview that 8,000 South Africans
have tested positive for the HIV virus, and 600 have developed
fullblown AIDS.
   The health department survey, involving samples of blood from
family clinics, hospitals and other sources, estimated that the
number of people exposed to the HIV virus doubles every nine
months, Evians said.
   He called the estimate of 100,000 HIV-positive South Africans
``conservative.''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease that attacks
the body's immune system, rendering it unable to fight off cancers,
infections and other diseases. There is no known cure.
   HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.
   The disease is spread through the blood and other bodily fluids.
Homosexuals, intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs have been at
greatest risk to exposure.
   Evians said the survey indicated a rise in the spread of the HIV
virus through heterosexual contact.

   A strike by Air France employees shut down
the airport at this French Riviera city for a second straight day
Friday and stranded thousands of passengers.
   ``We're fed up with being taken hostage,'' fumed one passenger
whose flight was canceled.
   The Air France employees went on strike Thursday, claiming that
the company's plans to reduce the number of foreign flights to and
from Nice could cost the jobs of 300 workers.
   The strike came as talks between management and union
negotiators broke down.
   The Air France workers kept planes from landing or taking off by
blocking the airport's runway with catering trucks.
   Many passengers were stranded at the airport until late Friday
morning, when the company transported them in buses to Toulon to
take rerouted flights.

<HEAD>No-Confidence Motion Launched Against Socialist Goverment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK McDOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three main right-wing parties filed a censure
motion today against the Socialist government, setting the stage
for a parliamentary battle that could unseat Premier Michel Rocard.
   The no-confidence motion stems from strong opposition to
proposed reforms in taxation for social security. A vote on the
motion is scheduled for Monday.
   The dispute poses the biggest threat for Rocard since President
Francois Mitterrand named him premier when the Socialists regained
effective control of Parliament in 1988.
   The Socialists lack an outright majority in the National
Assembly, and have relied in the past on abstentions by the usually
friendly Communist Party to defeat conservative-sponsored censure
motions.
   This time, the Communists have pledged to support the motion.
   ``It's the first time the Communist Party will have crossed the
yellow line,'' said National Assembly President Laurent Fabius, a
Socialist and former prime minister.
   Nonetheless, Fabius predicted in a radio interview that Rocard,
his bitter rival in jockeying to succeed Mitterrand, would weather
the vote. ``I don't think there's going to be a majority to reverse
the government,'' Fabius said.
   Rocard, a technocrat from the Socialists' pragmatic wing, has
survived four no-confidence motions during his tenure thanks to
Communist abstentions.
   The premier says he is relying on support from centrist deputies
to make up his party's shortfall of 19 seats from an overall
majority in the 577-seat National Assembly.
   The three parties that introduced the motion include the Rally
for the Republic headed by Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac, the Union
for French Democracy led by former president Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, and the smallish Center Union party.
   Together with the Communists, they can muster 286 votes - just
three short of the 289 needed to bring down the government.
   The Socialists have 272 seats. Rocard is counting on defections
from the ranks of right-wing parties and support from the 20
non-affiliated deputies, about 15 of whom normally vote with the
Socialists.
   The 1.1 percent social security tax would replace part of the
existing social security contributions paid by employers and
employees.

   Police destroyed 17 cocaine-processing
laboratories in a series of raids deep in the southeastern
Colombian jungle, police said Friday.
   In the Caribbean port town of Cartagena, meanwhile, security
forces seized 375 pounds of pure cocaine that was being transported
in an 18-wheel truck to a clandestine airport, national police
spokesman Maj. Jorge Martin said.
   The cocaine, hidden in bags labeled ``sugar,'' was destined for
export to the United States, Martin said. After finding the drugs,
police arrested the truck's driver and two passengers, he added.
   In a southeastern jungle region known as San Jose de Guaviare,
anti-narcotics police destroyed 17 drug laboratories and
confiscated chemicals and equipment used to process cocaine, Martin
said.
   He said the drug suspects escaped into surrounding jungle upon
hearing the approaching police.
   The government of President Cesar Gaviria is pressing on with
its anti-drug crackdown despite intimidation from the Medellin
cocaine cartel.
   In the past three months, the cartel has kidnapped nine
journalists, some of whom belong to Colombia's most influential
families.
   Colombia's Medellin and Cali cartels supply most of the cocaine
consumed in the United States and Europe.

   Stormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver
transplant recipient, died of an unusual rejection of her
transplanted heart, doctors said today.
   The cause of her death surprised doctors at Children's Hospital
of Pittsburgh, where Stormie had her historic operation in February
1984. It's unusual for heart rejection to occur so long after
surgery, said Dr. F. Jay Fricker, a pediatric cardiologist.
   ``I've never seen it occur or reported in the literature
before,'' he said at a news conference. ``It's unique that it
happened this late and so acutely.''
   Stormie died Sunday at Children's Hospital after being rushed
from her home in White Settlement, Texas, with a sore throat and
fever. She was 13.
   Fricker said it's not known why the heart was rejected. He said
Stormie showed no signs of heart trouble.
   Doctors said they would study whether the unusual rejection was
related to the experimental anti-rejection drug Stormie was taking.
The drug, FK-506, is being tested only at the University of
Pittsburgh hospitals, of which Children's is one.
   Meanwhile, Stormie's mother said Thursday she cherished the time
she had with her daughter because she knew time was short.
   ``Everything that Stormie did was to me special, because I
always knew that some day we wouldn't have Stormie any more,'' Lois
``Suzie'' Purcell said in her first public comments since Stormie
died.
   In the six years since the historic transplant operation,
Stormie had endured organ rejection, hepatitis and a second liver
transplant last February.
   Mrs. Purcell thanked the hundreds of people she has never met
who sent encouraging wishes during Stormie's six-year struggle for
life.
   About 1,500 people are expected to attend a public funeral
service set for Saturday.
   ``I wanted to make sure that everybody understood that I
appreciate all the comfort, the financial help, the moral support
that these people have been over the last seven years,'' Mrs.
Purcell said.

<HEAD>Bush Promises No Vietnam-Like War in Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Inserts grafs 3-5, Bush who has, on congressional leaders
accompanying Bush</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, leaving tonight on an
eight-day trip to the Middle East and Europe, vows he will not
plunge the United States into a Vietnam-like war ``that we cannot
win'' in the Persian Gulf.
   ``There's not going to be any long drawn-out agony of Vietnam,''
Bush said Thursday in an interview on Cable News Network. He said
the reason he is sending 200,000 more troops to Saudi Arabia was to
demonstrate to Iraq's Saddam Hussein that ``we are deadly serious''
about demanding that he withdraw his troops from Kuwait and free
all hostages.
   Bush, who has been seeking to rally stronger congressional
support for his Persian Gulf actions, will be joined in Saudi
Arabia on Thanksgiving Day by the top four House and Senate
leaders.
   ``I think it's a good indication. It sends a good signal, not
only to the American people, but hopefully to Saddam Hussein, that
there is bipartisanship and politics does stop at the water's
edge,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said today.
   Going to Saudi Arabia, in addition to Dole, are Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, House Speaker Thomas Foley,
D-Wash., and House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   Bush cautioned that Saddam is ``trying hard to get an atomic
weapon.'' And he said the world will have to insist on
international guarantees against further aggression by Iraq even if
it pulls out of Kuwait.
   The president's hard-line remarks signaled anew that he is not
in the mood to compromise with Baghdad over its invasion of Kuwait.
   Bush said he was not interested in arranging a face-saving
gesture for Saddam to sound a retreat.
   ``When you rape, pillage and plunder a neighbor, should you then
ask the world, `Hey, give me a little face, give me a little
face-saving so I can do what I should have done months ago?''' Bush
said.
   The Persian Gulf crisis was at the top of the president's agenda
as he prepared to depart tonight for Czechoslovakia, the first stop
on a journey that also will take him to Germany, France, Saudi
Arabia and Egypt.
   The emotional high point will be a Thanksgiving Day visit with
U.S. forces in the desert sands of Saudi Arabia.
   There also will be news on other fronts. He will be the first
U.S. president ever to visit Czechoslovakia.
   And, during a three-day summit in Paris, Bush will join Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Monday in signing a historic
East-West treaty sharply reducing non-nuclear forces that both NATO
and the Warsaw Pact maintain in central and eastern Europe.
   Bush and Gorbachev are to meet privately and are expected to
discuss the deterioration of the Soviet economy. The administration
is developing contingency plans to provide emergency food and
medicine to the Soviet Union to help it get through the winter,
officials said.
   In his CNN interview, Bush acknowledged that Congress alone has
the right to declare war, but he asserted that he has the primary
responsibility to ``make tough decisions'' to force Iraq out of
Kuwait.
   Referring to the makeup of the House and Senate, Bush said,
``And you can't have 435 commanders-in-chief and you can't have a
hundred commanders-in-chief.''
   He rejected any comparison between the Persian Gulf and Vietnam.
   ``I will not, as commander-in-chief, ever put somebody into a
military situation that we do not win - ever,'' Bush vowed. ``And
there's not going to be any long drawn-out agony of Vietnam. So I
reject that parallel.
   ``But I can understand why people say that,'' he added.
``Because they are thinking, we don't want to have a drawn-out
Vietnam.''
   The president's eight-day trip will open Saturday morning in
Prague. Before an anticipated audience of hundreds of thousands of
people, he will lay a wreath in Wenceslas Square to commemorate the
first anniversary of the ``Velvet Revolution'' that led to the
overthrow of the country's communist rulers.
   The visit is intended to toast the resurgence of democracy and
pay tribute to Czechoslovakia's courage in facing economic
hardships as it discards a state-controlled economy in favor of a
free-market system.
   The celebration of democracy also is the theme of a five-hour
stop on Sunday in Germany for talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. It
will be Bush's first meeting with Kohl since he successfully
engineered one of the most dramatic episodes in modern European
history - German unification.
   From Germany, Bush will travel to Paris for the 34-nation summit
to strengthen cooperation between East and West. Bush will use the
occasion to sound out Britain, France, the Soviet Union and others
on the wording of a U.N. resolution authorizing force to drive Iraq
out of Kuwait.
   From Paris, he will fly to Saudi Arabia to confer with its
leaders and the exiled leadership of Kuwait.
   On Thanksgiving Day, Bush will visit in the Saudi desert with
troops who may be ordered to fight Iraqi forces. He will be the
first U.S. president to visit front-line troops since Richard Nixon
in Vietnam in 1969.
   He also will stop in Cairo before returning to Washington.

<HEAD>Federal Officials Charge Car Dealer With Repossessing Car of
Guardsman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VICKSBURG, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors say a car dealer who
repossessed the car of a National Guardsman serving in Saudi Arabia
violated an act that protects soldiers from creditors when they're
called to active duty.
   ``It happened the second week we were married,'' Sally
DeRossette, the 19-year-old wife of Matthew M. DeRossette, said
Thursday. ``It was the only car we had.''
   The U.S. attorney's office filed the misdemeanor charge
Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Jackson against Mike Kavanaugh,
who operates Rocking Horse Motors in Vicksburg.
   Prosecutors say Kavanaugh repossessed the 1981 Buick on Oct. 17
while DeRossette, 22, was training for Operation Desert Shield at
Fort Rucker, Ala.
   DeRossette, a member of the 114th Military Police Company of
Clinton, went to Saudi Arabia Nov. 9. He had purchased the car Aug.
17.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Tucker said Kavanaugh violated the
Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act of 1940. Violation of the act
carries up to a year in prison and a $1,000 fine.
   Tucker said it appeared that ``Mr. Kavanaugh decided to
circumvent the court procedures set forth in the act. Creditors
need to check to see if they're in compliance because we've got a
lot of young men over there.''
   Kavanaugh said Thursday he did not know DeRossette had been
called to duty.
   ``After I found out he had gone on active service, I told him I
would be glad to give it back,'' he said.
   William M. Bost Jr., Kavanaugh's attorney, said the car dealer
had ``offered it back if they will insure it and agree to pay a 6
percent rate of interest. They don't seem to want that.''
   Sally DeRossette said she had not heard from Kavanaugh or his
attorney.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced plans
today to replace military and government officials blocking his
economic reforms, and he urged support for a new treaty to hold the
country together.
   The Soviet leader addressed the Supreme Soviet legislature,
which had demanded he give a full report on his plans for political
and economic change.
   Lawmakers reacted coolly to Gorbachev's 90-minute speech,
refusing to applaud and rising to ask him questions when it was
finished.
   He left the floor without answering, and deputies took
microphones to complain that he had not addressed their concerns
about the economy.
   Gorbachev is locked in a power struggle with Russian Federation
Presdient Boris N. Yeltsin that has paralyzed their rival
governments over economic reform.
   Yeltsin later took the floor and demanded Gorbachev agree within
two weeks to form a new ``extraordinary anti-crisis committee'' to
govern in place of Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and his Cabinet.
Yeltsin said the committee would include leaders of all 15
republics.
   The latest conflict threw new uncertainty into the government
crisis that has pitted Russia, the largest Soviet republic, against
the Kremlin, which still holds the Soviet purse strings and
dictates economic and foreign policy.
   Yeltsin and Gorbachev met on Sunday and agreed to form parallel
commissions to decide how to divide control over the economy.
Today, they focused on their separate plans for ending the economic
crisis that has left most store shelves bare and rendered the ruble
currency increasingly worthless.
   Gorbachev said measures to reorganize the government and ``get
rid of outdated, clearly useless structures'' would be submitted to
the legislature within 10 days.
   He did not detail the changes but said they had Ryzhkov's
approval, indicating the embattled prime minister would not be
among those affected, despite Yeltsin's call for him to resign.
   Gorbachev has used his presidential powers to issue decrees on
the economy, including ordering state businesses to fill orders and
raising the prices of certain goods to stimulate domestic
production.
   Some of the orders, however, have been countermanded by
separatist-minded republics, including Russia.
   It is unclear who will be obeyed across the country of 285
million people.
   Gorbachev, faced with restive republics and ethnic violence in
the chaotic period of transition to a market economy, promised
changes ``in the top echelon of the armed forces command.''
   Pounding the lectern for emphasis, he rejected persistent rumors
of a military coup and said people were spreading them to discredit
the army.
   ``We cannot discredit the armed forces because we need them now
to maintain stability in the country,'' Gorbachev said.
   The Soviet president, alternately speaking forcefully and very
softly, also urged the legislature to consider a moratorium on new
republic laws that contradict national ones.
   He said that in the near future, he would nullify decisions by
republics and local governments that denied soldiers and their
families civil rights, particularly in the restive Baltics.
   All but one of the republics have declared some sort of
sovereignty from the Kremlin. But Gorbachev's plans for developing
a market economy hinge on the republics agreeing to stay in the
union.
   Gorbachev has proposed a new treaty that would give the
republics a degree of autonomy while leaving national economic and
military power in Kremlin hands.
   ``We don't need political leaders who stimulate separatism and
nationalism, we need help to consolidate the country,'' Gorbachev
said.
   After the Soviet leader's speech, several deputies took the
floor to complain that Gorbachev had not addressed their concerns
about the economy.
   ``We didn't hear what we wanted to hear,'' said Yuri Blokhin, a
legislator from Moldavia. ``We wanted to hear concrete measures,
but he didn't give us anything.''
   Speaking during a break outside the chamber, Leningrad Mayor
Anatoly Sobchak said Gorbachev's speech ``was not what we need.
What we need are extraordinary measures.''
   During his speech, Gorbachev lowered his voice to a near-whisper
when he began discussing a coalition with Yeltsin, his chief
political foe.
   Calling his Sunday meeting with Yeltsin simply ``routine,'' he
rejected the idea of giving the Russian leader more national power
and hinted at the dangers of Russian nationalism.
   ``In a coalition government, if the Russian government gets any
more power, it will mean discrimination against the other
republics,'' Gorbachev said.
   After Gorbachev's speech, the white-haired Yeltsin told
legislators that the first task of the proposed anti-crisis
committee would be to take an inventory of all the food in the
country and distribute it where necessary.
   ``The crisis we are experiencing now is still a crisis of a
totalitarian state, which is reflected in the paralysis of power,''
Yeltsin said. ``The center is sliding down to confrontation with
the republics, and first of all, with Russia.''
   Emerging later during a recess, Yeltsin said the committee would
not work with Ryzhkov. ``But we might form a coalition with
Gorbachev,'' he told reporters.

   Following are excerpts from President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's address today to the Supreme Soviet legislature as
translated by The Associated Press:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ON GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION - Now about the structure of the
union government. It should be decisively changed even before the
signing of the union treaty. First of all, this question is
reflected in the union treaty and is solved fundamentally. You'll
see it yourself when in several days you get a draft concept of the
treaty. First of all, we should get rid of outdated, clearly
useless strucures. Suggestions in this respect should be submitted
in the next 10 days.
   We should finish with the formation of new bodies created in
connection with transition to a market economy - I mean an
interregional committee on economic reform, an anti-monopoly
committee and others. The reorganization of the government should
be accompanied by a renewal of its members. Those who are most
competent should be brought into government.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ON PARALYSIS OF POWER - Now everybody is talking about the
crisis of power. The center is getting a flow of ultimatums to take
decisive measures on improving the situation in the country. We
should ask ourselves bluntly, what is the matter? Why, instead of a
totalitarian power, there has come a vacuum of power. This is where
the matter lies. We should clarify the question.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ON ROLE OF COMMUNIST PARTY - In the past, we could describe the
mechanism of power in practically one word: the party. It
infiltrated practically everything, both the state organizations
and public structures. Any decision of the CPSU was regarded as an
order not subject to discussion. It was a tough, in its own way
logical, authoritative system which, however, was not only
incompatible with democratic principles, but, as we know, led to
colossal losses and flaws as far as the social progress of the
country is concerned.
   We have consciously dropped it, and there is no way backwards.
But, moving away from an old structure of power, we have not yet
created democratic mechanisms that would meet the new tasks. When a
decision is taken by the president, where is that mechanism that
would work as in the past?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ON SHARING OF POWER - The largest part of the existing
contradictions and misundertandings, paralyzing the activity of
administrative bodies on all levels, has resulted from the absence
of a clear and precise demarcation in competence between the union
republics and central power.
   We don't need political leaders who stimulate separatism and
nationalism. We need help to consolidate the country.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ON IMPENDING CHANGE IN MILITARY COMMAND LEADERSHIP - We cannot
discredit the army because we need them now to maintain stability
in the country.

   A freight train struck a school bus at an
unguarded crossing today, killing two and injuring 21, authorities
said. Frantic pupils from a nearby school had to be restrained from
going to the site.
   Bob Stier, transportation supervisor for the Alexandria public
schools, said those killed were the bus driver and a student, one
of about 25 on the bus.
   ``It is just horrendous,'' said Sheila Olson, principal at the
Miltona Science Magnet School, where the bus had just dropped off
passengers before heading for the high school in Alexandria, 10
miles to the south. ``I still can't believe it happened. It's just
not real.''
   Seven of the injured were in stable condition at Douglas County
Hospital in Alexandria with fractures and internal injuries, said
Bill Flaig, hospital administrator. ``It looks like they're going
to be here for a while,'' he said.
   Fourteen people were treated and released after the 7:30 a.m.
accident, Flaig said.
   Ms. Olson said the accident scene was visible from the school
and teachers had to restrain some children from going to the site.
Some of them were ``very upset'' because they had just gotten off
the bus and some had older brothers and sisters still aboard, she
said.
   ``The kids, many were crying, wanting their parents, and you
just feel so helpless,'' she said. ``You just don't know what to
do.''
   The cause was not immediately known, a sheriff's dispatcher
said.
   ``The front end of the bus got hit,'' Stier said. ``It was a
flat-nosed bus and (the train) hit the side where the driver was.''
   ``The bus got spun around, then the front end of the bus hit a
light pole,'' Stier said, adding that the train did not derail.
   John Bergene, spokesman for the Minneapolis-based Soo Line
Railroad, said there were no injuries on the train.
   The maximum speed at the County Road 14 crossing is 40 mph,
Bergene said, but the train's speed when the collision occurred was
not yet known. There are yellow warning signs and stop signs at the
crossing, but no flashing signals, he said.
   Stier said the bus driver was in his 60s and had been driving
school buses for about 10 years. The bus was owned by the school
district, he said.
   Ms. Olson said the district has brought in a team of counselors
to help comfort the children.
   The Rev. Nancy Larson, a Lutheran minister from Carlos, was
among those trying to help. ``I just simply stood in the halls as
students were walking back and forth between their rooms and just
shared hugs with some of the children who were in tears and very
frightened by it,'' she said.

<HEAD>Paper Publishes Ad Appealing for Iranians' Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper advertisement published
Friday appealed for information on four missing Iranians whose fate
has been linked to some of the Western hostages held by pro-Iranian
extremists.
   The half-page ad, signed by relatives of the missing Iranians,
appeared in the leading Beirut newspaper An-Nahar.
   ``We came to collect the pieces of our hearts,'' it said. The
relatives arrived in Lebanon Tuesday.
   The ad carried pictures of the Iranians, who disappeared in the
Christian enclave during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
   Christian warlord Samir Geagea said in a TV interview Tuesday
that the Iranians were killed after their abduction by right-wing
militiamen under the command of his pro-Syrian rival, Elie Hobeika.
   Iran has interceded on behalf of Western hostages held in
Lebanon, and it has said it would help secure the relese of the
remaining 13 in return for information about the Iranians.
   Mohsen Musavi, charge d'affaires at the Iranian embassy, was one
of those abducted. His wife, Maryam, said at a news conference
Thursday that the Iranians were alive.
   ``The latest information we received ascertains that all four
Iranians are still alive in the Laqlouq prison of the Lebanese
Forces Christian militia headed by Samir Geagea,'' Mrs. Musavi
said.
   ``We got this information from newly freed prisoners from
Laqlouq jail who came to our embassy in Nicosia,'' Cyprus, she
said.
   Laqlouq is a ski resort in the mountains of Kesrouan province
about 40 miles northeast of Beirut. The region is a Lebanese Forces
militia stronghold.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the most influential Shiite
Moslem cleric, said Thursday that the fate of the four missing
Iranians should be revealed ``because this is a tragedy as inhuman
as the detention of the (Western) hostages.''
   Fadlallah is the spiritual guide of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is the umbrella for underground
factions holding most of the Westerners missing in Lebanon.
   Fadlallah has made appeals for the release of hostages in the
past. They appear to have had no tangible impact on the kidnappers
of the Western hostages, despite his influence on religious
matters.
   However, when the self-styled Organization of Islamic Dawn
released former American hostages Robert Polhill and Frank Reed
last April, it said the releases were due, among other things, to
the ``behests of senior religious leaders.''
   The remaining Western hostages are six Americans, four Britons,
two West Germans and an Italian.
   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, 43, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.

   Iben Browning has incurred the wrath of
geologists and seismologists for projecting a 50-50 chance for a
major earthquake on the New Madrid Fault zone in early December.
   He may soon be getting in trouble with economists.
   During a presentation Thursday to a St. Louis business group,
the New Mexico scientist said it appears that conditions are right
for the world to fall into a depression in 1992.
   ``For climatological reasons, we will reach the bottom of the
depression about the end of 1992. ... I expect (it) will be the
most severe since 1776, more severe than the 1930s,'' Browning
said.
   Among other things he said:
   - That high tidal forces have affected such things as the size
of the wheat crop in the Soviet Union and the rise of Nazism before
World War II.
   - That volcanoes cause acid rain, not coal-burning factories and
power plants.
   - That the temperature of ice in Greenland affects the world
economy.
   One thing he didn't spend much time talking about was his
projection that strong tidal forces could touch off a major
earthquake in the Midwest about Dec. 3. He also had nothing to say
about the overwhelming criticism it has prompted.
   ``That would be a waste of time. I'd rather just stick to my
work,'' said Browning.
   Although he referred to his projection as a ``guesstimate,'' he
said he was confident in his reasoning and thought people should
listen to what he has to say.
   Browning's projection has created a stir in parts of the Midwest
where residents have bought survival kits and earthquake insurance.
   The New Madrid Fault runs from Marked Tree, Ark., north to
Cairo, Ill., and affects parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee,
Illinois and Kentucky.
   In 1811 and 1812, three major quakes caused widespread
devastation along the fault, rattled chimneys as far away as Boston
and knocked residents of Nashville and Cincinnati to the ground.
   Earthquake experts say there's a good chance of another quake in
the region eventually, but have dismissed Browning's theories of
the chances of one being triggered by tidal forces.
   Browning, 72, of Tijares, N.M., is chief scientist for Summa
Medical Corp., an Albuquerque biotechnology research and
development company.
   He has a doctorate degree in physiology and bachelor's degrees
in physics and math. He has studied climatology on his own and
publishes ``The Browning Newsletter'' on world climates.

   Lawyers for Manuel Noriega headed for federal court
today for a hearing on whether the deposed Panamanian dictator
should be appointed a government-paid defense attorney, and also
sought to have the charges thrown out.
   Noriega's private defense team, led by Fran Rubino, had claimed
the U.S. government has sabotaged its work by freezing Noriega's
assets, leaving no money for legal fees.
   In what Rubino said may be one of his last acts in the Noriega
case, he filed a motion today to dismiss the charges, accusing the
government of a conspiracy to deny Noriega's rights to a fair trial
and effective legal counsel.
   The motion accuses the government of misconduct by taping
Noriega's prison phone calls with his attorneys. Cable News Network
reported last week that it had obtained tapes of such calls.
   The defense motion also accuses the prosecution of illegally
freezing his funds, and says an unidentified government witness
attempted to entrap the attorneys two months ago by soliciting a
bribe to change his testiony.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler on Tuesday set a deadline
of today for Noriega's lawyers and the prosecution to work out a
payment plan. Otherwise, he said, he will declare Noriega indigent
and appoint an attorney on the U.S. payroll.
   If declared indigent, Noriega would be allowed two attorneys
paid a maximum of $75 an hour and investigative expenses of a few
thousand dollars.
   By contrast, the Justice Department has 30 lawyers on the case
and is prepared to spend up $30 million to prosecute Noriega on
charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from Colombian cocaine
smugglers, Rubino said.
   The tight budget for indigent defendants makes it nearly
impossible for government-appointed attorneys to compete, said Yale
Kamisar, a law professor at the University of Michigan.
   ``You need investigators, you need experts ... to challenge the
government, to put them to the test,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Cable News Network has asked the U.S. Supreme Court
to overturn Hoeveler's ruling of last week prohibiting the
broadcast of taped jailhouse telephone conversations between
Noriega and his lawyers.
   On Thursday, the FBI, which is investigating how CNN obtained
the government tapes, seized tapes and papers that had been stored
in a CNN reporter's hotel room. The network claims the material was
improperly removed from the hotel room by security guards and has
demanded the FBI return it.
   Soon after the United States invaded Panama last December, the
Justice Department asked other countries to freeze 27 bank accounts
holding about $20 million in purported ill-gotten gains allegedly
controlled by Noriega.
   Hoeveler ordered about $6 million freed in June, but prosecutors
said the foreign governments then confiscated the money on their
own.
   Also at issue is $5.8 million in cash found by U.S. troops in
Noriega's offices in Panama. Prosecutors said that upon surrender
Noriega denied the money was his and that it was then turned over
to the Panamanian government.
   Rubino said Noriega never disavowed the money.

<HEAD>Reports: Mozambican Refugees Being Sold As Slaves In South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young refugees from the civil
war in Mozambique are being sold in South Africa for use as slave
laborers, concubines or sacrifice in magic rituals, two newspapers
reported Friday.
   The Weekly Mail and The Sowetan, both anti-apartheid newspapers,
reported that the Mozambican refugees were being sold in the
Johannesburg region for about $140 each, to both whites and blacks.
   The reports said some slaves were killed during ``muti'' or
magic rituals.
   The Weekly Mail said one of its reporters purchased two slaves,
Jorge Mthembu, 17, and Immanuel Kambule, 18, for $80 each. The
youths did not know they had been sold as slaves, it said.
   Reporter Phil Molefe wrote that he bought the teen-agers from a
dealer near the Mozambican border. The Weekly Mail said it decided
to buy slaves ``to prove that the traffic in human beings exists.''
   ``They are now at my mercy. If they refuse to work, demand pay
or threaten to run away I can call the police and have them
arrested as illegals and deported,'' Molefe wrote.
   Police officials had no comment on the reports.
   Refugees fleeing the war in Mozambique are smuggled over the
border by men claiming they will get them jobs in South Africa.
Once in South Africa, the refugees are sold to farmers, businessmen
or men who want wives or concubines.
   Many of the female slaves are between 14 and 17-years-old, the
reports said. They are sold as wives or concubines and some are
beaten if they refuse to sleep with their purchasers, they said.
   ``Young girls who refused to be sold to local men as wives were
reported to have been taken to the bush - and it was not known what
happened to them,'' the Mail reported.
   Male slaves are used to work in shops, businesses or on farms,
and are purchased by whites and blacks, the reports said.
   The Weekly Mail said white farmers use the refugees as laborers,
often providing only food or clothing and no wages. Farmers
frequently call police and have them returned to Mozambique as
illegal refugees when they are no longer needed, it said.
   Some slaves reportedly were sold for magic and killed in rituals
in the black homeland of KaNgwane near Mozambique, The Sowetan
reported.
   ``It is easy to kill them. They have no identification and no
family. Their origins are unknown and, sad as it is, nobody will
miss a refugee,'' aid worker Rachel Nsimbisi was quoted as saying.
   The Weekly Mail said refugees were willing to accept almost any
conditions rather than return to Mozambique, where right-wing
guerrillas are fighting the leftist government.
   ``Most of the fugitives are unwilling to return to Mozambique
because even the most adverse conditions in South Africa -
including slavery and forced labor - are preferable to life amid
the devastation caused by war,'' it said.

   Cable News Network is demanding the FBI return a
box of recordings and papers related to the government's taping of
Manuel Noriega's jailhouse phone calls. The material was taken from
a hotel room where a CNN reporter stayed.
   Both an FBI official and CNN President Tom Johnson said today
they didn't know if the recordings were audio tapes or videotapes,
or if they were the phone calls between Noriega and his lawyers
that are at the center of a legal battle before the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   ``We just know that there were notes, work papers and tapes''
related to CNN's coverage of the Noriega story, Johnson said. ``But
in the process of working in an operation like this, you could have
all sorts of tapes, including (taped) air checks.''
   The box of material was given to the FBI on Thursday by security
guards at the hotel. CNN claimed the box was improperly removed
from the room of reporter Marlene Fernandez and that the FBI
obtained it without a warrant.
   CNN reported today that an FBI agent showed up at the CNN
Washington bureau looking for Fernandez and a producer, Kathy
Slobogan. Neither was present.
   Bureau officials told the agent that CNN would cooperate with
the FBI, but would not allow ``fishing expeditions'' through CNN
offices, the network said on a midday newscast.
   William Hinshaw, head of the FBI bureau in Atlanta, said today
that after a Thursday night meeting with CNN officials, he agreed
to seal the box and not take inventory of its contents until the
Justice Department orders him to do so.
   The FBI previously said agents would go through the box today.
   Hinshaw said he didn't know what materials were in the box. He
said he did see some cassettes in the box, but was uncertain if
they were audio or video cassettes, although he said ``one I saw
appeared to be a (audio) cassette.''
   The network has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a
federal judge's order, issued last week, barring it from airing
recordings of conversations between Noriega and the fallen
Panamanian dictator's legal team.
   In addition, a hearing was scheduled in Miami this afternoon to
determine whether Noriega, whose assets have been frozen by
prosecutors, should be declared indigent and appointed a government
defense attorney.
   Lead defense attorney Frank Rubino, saying it might be one of
his last acts in the Noriega case, today filed a motion to dismiss
the charges against Noriega, accusing the government of engaging in
a conspiracy to deny ``his right to a fair trial and the effective
assistance of counsel.''
   The motion accuses the government of misconduct by taping
Noriega's prison phone calls with his lawyers as well as illegally
freezing his funds. It also says an unidentified government witness
attempted to entrap the attorneys two months ago by soliciting a
bribe to change his testiony.
   Noriega is being held in a Miami jail, awaiting trial on charges
of taking $4.6 million in payoffs to protect the cocaine trade. The
FBI is investigating how CNN obtained seven tapes of his jail cell
phone conversations.
   FBI spokesman Scott Nelson in Washington said Thursday that
agents obtained the box without a warrant. ``We were made aware of
the tapes and merely picked them up for analysis,'' he said.
   Johnson said he protested the FBI's action ``in the strongest
terms'' to agency officials in Washington.
   CNN general counsel Steve Korn said today he'd written Joseph
Whitley, the U.S. attorney in Atlanta, ``demanding the return of
the tapes and that the materials in the box not be reviewed or
duplicated.''
   The New York Times today quoted an unidentified CNN official as
saying the actual Noriega recordings were not in the box.
   ``The FBI did not get the main course,'' the official said.
   The box was removed Monday from a room that had been occupied by
Fernandez, who has been working on the Noriega story.
   Her room was at the Omni Hotel, which is owned by CNN's parent
company, Turner Broadcasting, and is part of a complex that also
houses CNN's offices.
   Hotel manager Bill Thompson said hotel security officers thought
Fernandez had checked out when they removed a box containing papers
and at least one videotape.
   CNN's Johnson said today that Fernandez, who has been covering
the Noriega story, ``had not checked out of the room. But
apparently there was a mistake'' by the hotel that led to her room
being cleared out.
   After taking the box from the room, the hotel's security guards
saw that some of its contents were CNN property, he said. They
turned the material over to Turner security officers from whom the
FBI took the box, he said.
   He and Korn said it still unclear how the FBI was notified about
the box.
   ``I don't know who called who,'' Korn said.
   Turner Security, which provides security for the CNN Center
complex, ``had a discussion with the FBI inquiring about stolen
government property and Turner Security told them they had a box
that might fit that description,'' CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said
Thursday. CNN denied the material in the box was stolen.
   Haworth said Turner Security - a subsidiary of CNN's parent
company, Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. - did not tell
appropriate CNN officials it had the box.
   CNN said agents took the box over the objections of a network
attorney who was present. Korn said the attorney ``asked for a
warrant and was not given an answer, and certainly not given a
warrant.''
   Meanwhile, CNN lawyers on Thursday asked Supreme Court Justice
Anthony Kennedy to set aside a judge's order barring broadcast of
the phone conversations.
   Kennedy, who handles such emergency matters from Florida,
referred the case to the full court. There was no word on when it
might act.
   CNN is challenging an order issued by U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler in Miami on Nov. 8 that bars it from broadcasting
the tapes until Hoeveler can determine whether the broadcasts would
violate Noriega's rights.
   CNN refused to give up the tapes but agreed not to air any
attorney-client recordings until the Supreme Court decides the
matter. The network contends Hoeveler's order is an
unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech.
   Federal prison officials say inmates' phone calls routinely are
monitored, except when prisoners say they are talking to their
lawyers. But CNN said it has tapes that include conversations
between Noriega and his defense team.

   City Council postponed debate on a

   Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar won a
parliamentary vote of confidence Friday and appealed for an end to
the sectarian conflict that brought down his predecessor's
government.
   The vote came after seven hours of acrimonious debate between
supporters of the new government and lawmakers who questioned its
legitimacy because of the political deals made to form it.
   ``The country cannot afford confrontation. We cannot go on
fighting with each other,'' Chandra Shekhar told the lower house of
Parliament.
   The 522-member house voted 269-204 in Chandra Shekhar's favor,
formally endorsing his taking over as head of the government.
Fifteen legislators abstained and the rest were absent.
   More than 390 people have been killed across India in the past
four weeks in Hindu-Moslem riots and in clashes with police over a
Hindu fundamentalist group's plan to build a temple at a site now
occupied by a mosque.
   Chandra Shekhar said he would hold talks with the Hindu World
Council to stop its campaign to demolish the mosque in the holy
Hindu city of Ayodhya, 310 miles east of New Delhi.
   ``Even if they do not want to talk to me, I will go on talking
to them,'' he said. ``I shall talk to every citizen of India, but
there will be no compromise on the unity and integrity of India.''
   Chandra Shekhar replaced his longtime rival, V.P. Singh.
   Singh's minority government fell apart when a right-wing Hindu
party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, withdrew its support last month,
angered by Singh's opposition to the temple construction plan.
   Chandra Shekhar belonged to Singh's Janata Dal party, but broke
away two days before Singh lost a vote of confidence and resigned
as prime minister Nov. 7.
   The temple campaign led to Hindu-Moslem riots in scores of towns
and villages across India. The strife touched the capital for the
first time on Wednesday when at least six people were killed in
clashes. A seventh person died of stab wounds on Friday.
   Hindus make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people. Moslems
comprise 12 percent.
   Chandra Shekhar's Janata Dal-Socialist party, a breakaway
faction of Janata Dal, claims to have 68 sworn followers, or barely
10 percent of seats in the lower house of Parliament. But he joined
with his longtime rival, ex-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, to win
enough votes for a majority.
   Gandhi's Congress Party and its allies have 210 seats.
   Chandra Shekhar defended the alliance and appealed for a ``new
political climate.''
   ``At this moment we should try to agree to work together,'' he
said.
   But the alliance was denounced across the political spectrum.
   ``It is a mockery and debasement of democratic norms ... a
two-headed monster with no body and limbs,'' said Somnath
Chatterjee of the Left Front, an alliance of communist and
socialist parties.
   Lal Krishna Advani, leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party,
accused Chandra Shekhar of abandoning the voters who ousted
Gandhi's Congress Party from power in general elections less than a
year ago.
   ``This government lacks political legitimacy,'' Advani said.
   So far, the government is composed of only Chandra Shekhar and
his deputy prime minister, Devi Lal. Other Cabinet ministers are
likely to be named within three days.
   There are doubts as to how long the new government will last.
Analysts say Gandhi will withdraw his support whenever he thinks
the Congress Party is ready to contest elections.

   Daniel Ortega accused Washington Friday of
using the military buildup in the Persian Gulf to win permanent
dominance in the Middle East, and he likened it to the invasions of
Grenada and Panama.
   The former Nicaraguan president criticized the United States for
backing U.N. resolutions in support of occupied Kuwait, while doing
little to enforce resolutions calling for Israel to withdraw from
occupied territories.
   ``How come for them human rights apply to some people but not
the others?'' asked Ortega, who arrived Wednesday on a four-day
visit.
   ``There have been scores of (U.N.) resolutions on Israel's
occupation of Palestinian land. These resolutions should be
implemented too if there is to be a comprehensive settlement in the
region.''
   The official Iraqi News Agency reported earlier that Ortega
supported Saddam Hussein's proposal for a simultaneous settlement
of his invasion of Kuwait and the Israeli occupation of Palestinian
territories.
   Washington has rejected that linkage.
   The United States leads a multinational force of more than
350,000 troops arrayed against Iraq since its Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   Speaking of the U.S. gulf deployment, Ortega said: ``My country
has suffered from the same policy when they tried to undermine the
Sandinistas.''
   Washington supported the Contra rebels who fought Ortega's
leftist Sandinista government throughout most of the 1980s. Ortega
was defeated in February elections by a presidential candidate
supported by the United States.
   Referring to the 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada and the 1989
invasion of Panama, Ortega said: ``The invasion of Grenada and the
intervention in Panama are also other examples of the policy of
hegemony.''
   On Friday, Ortega met with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and
National Assembly Speaker Sadi Mehdi Saleh, the Iraqi News Agency
reported. It said Saleh told Ortega that Iraq wants the gulf crisis
resolved peacefully.
   ``But if the forces of evil attempt to ignite war, then Iraq
will be forced to fight back,'' the agency quoted Saleh as saying.
   It said that during his two separate meetings with Saleh and
Aziz, Ortega expressed support of Iraq in its drive to ``liberate
the region from American hegemony.''
   Ortega met on Thursday with Saddam. Baghdad television said they
discussed Third World countries that are ``trying to combat U.S.
hegemony.''

   A jury today sentenced mass murderer
Ramon Salcido to die in the gas chamber for the 1989 wine country
slayings of seven people, including his wife and two of their
children.
   Salcido, 29, showed no reaction when an interpreter told him the
jury's verdict. One juror wept as the sentence was being read.
   Judge Reginald Littrell sent formal sentencing for Dec. 17. He
has the power to reject the death penalty decision and impose the
only other alternative, life in prison, but such a move is rare in
California.
   The jury received the penalty phase of the case Tuesday
afternoon. The same panel had found him guilty of six counts of
first-degree murder, one count of second-degree murder and two
counts of attempted murder.
   Defense attorney Marteen Miller said the verdict would be
appealed to U.S. District Court.
   The Mexican-born Salcido, who fled to his home town of Los
Moches after the April 1989 slayings, was convicted of shooting or
slashing to death his wife, Angela, his 4-year-old and 22-month-old
daughters, Sofia and Teresa, his mother-in-law, Marion Richards,
her 12-year-old and 8-year-old daughters, Ruth and Maria, and
Tracey Toovey, 35, the winemaster at Grand Cru winery in Glen
Ellen.
   The jury also convicted Salcido of attempting to murder his
2-year-old daughter, Carmina, who was found slashed next to the
bodies of her sisters in a garbage dump, and Kenneth Butti, his
supervisor at the winery.
   The defense never disputed that Salcido was the killer and
during its concluding remarks to the jury called the killings
``unspeakable, horrendous, terrible crimes.''
   However, Miller contended his client was high on cocaine and
alcohol during the violence and described him as ``crazier than a
toad'' the night of the slayings.
   He had sought a verdict of second-degree murder or manslaughter
because he said the drugs had put Salcido in a ``psychotic
depression'' when the rampage began.
   He also said Salcido did not cooperate with his defenders.
   ``He was told not to wear  suit and he comes into court with a
suit and wearing cowboy boots,'' Miller said.
   Salcido's trial was moved from Sonoma County to San Mateo County
because of the extensive news coverage of the case. Littrell is a
Sierra County Superior Court judge who was assigned to the case.

   The United States helped organize ``sleeper''
guerrilla units in Western Europe in preparation for a possible
Soviet invasion, but it had nothing to do with those cells after
the 1950s, say current and former U.S. officials.
   Their comments contradict secret testimony obtained by The
Associated Press in Rome Friday that instructors of the Italian
anti-Communist network, codenamed Gladio, took part in a 1972
training exercise at a U.S. base in Germany.
   In the testimony, a military intelligence official who
supervised Gladio in the 1970s also said the United States funded
construction and a first arms shipment for a Gladio training base
set up on the island of Sardinia in the 1960s.
   ``Gladio was a purely Italian operation. We had no connection
with it'' or with other individual country networks, said one U.S.
official.
   Former CIA director William Colby said he did not recall having
any direct contact with the groups when he headed the CIA from 1973
to 1976. Speaking in an interview from Moscow, where he was
attending a seminar, Colby said he helped set up such networks in
Scandinavia in the early 1950s.
   The comments of Colby and others came amid revelations flooding
Europe about the existence of anti-Soviet resistance networks in at
least 15 countries - from France in the west to Turkey in the east.
The operation was first exposed last month in Italy, where it was
codenamed Gladio for the short swords used by Roman gladiators.
   Most of the cells appear to have been disbanded starting in the
1970s, although press reports say the network's controlling body
still formally exists in Belgium.
   The CIA was aware the network was being maintained, but was not
involved in its running, officials said.
   The idea of establishing an underground resistance network was
conceived by several members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, said Colby.
   But Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti said the idea was
first broached by the United States, which approached Italy in
1951. He said the whole West European network came under NATO
control only in 1959.
   In his 1978 memoirs, Colby said the CIA set up the Office of
Policy Coordination in the late 1940s to plan ``for the not
unlikely possibility of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe.''
   ``The OPC wanted to be in a position to activate well-armed and
well-organized partisan uprisings against the occupiers,'' he said
in the book entitled ``Honorable Men - My Life in the CIA.''
   An official familiar with the U.S. role, who asked not to be
named, said the idea should be viewed in the context of the
anti-Communist fears of the late 1940s and the Cold War of the
early 1950s.
   With Eastern European countries falling under Soviet control one
by one, with Soviet-backed North Korea invading the south, and with
the anti-Communist witchhunt in the United States orchestrated by
Senator Joseph McCarthy, ``it made complete sense,'' he said.
   With the lesson of Europe's failure to throw off Nazi occupation
during World War II fresh in their minds, U.S. officials were
determined to be prepared in advance against a Soviet threat.
   The CIA undertook ``a major program of building throughout West
European countries ... clandestine infrastructures of leaders and
equipment trained and ready to be called into action as sabotage
and espionage forces when the time came,'' Colby wrote.
   Colby, who had parachuted into Norway in 1944 to link up with
Norwegian resistance fighters and help them organize sabotage
activity against the Nazis, was picked to set up anti-Communist
networks in Scandinavia.
   Colby was sent to Stockholm in 1951 and for the next two years
he organized ``stay behind'' networks in the four Scandinavian
countries. In two of them he worked freely with the intelligence
agencies; in the two others, his contacts with the intelligence
agencies were limited and he had to rely more on his own contacts,
Colby wrote.
   While he didn't identify the countries that offered him more
freedom, Colby strongly indicated they were Norway and Denmark,
which were members of NATO. Sweden, which is militarily neutral,
and Finland are not.
   Colby said the operatives he recruited were civilians. One was a
journalist; another an American graduate student studying in
Scandinavia; a third, an American of Scandinavian descent who had
returned to his native country to run a farm.
   In the interview, Colby said he did not know about the network's
weapons caches which have been described by various European
newspapers in recent days. ``I don't know about weapons caches. If
they existed, they were kept secret.''
   Colby said he did not have anything to do with setting up the
Gladio network in Italy, although he was posted by the CIA to Rome
in 1953.
   His task there, Colby recounted in his book, was to funnel
several million dollars and U.S. expertise to strengthen the
centrist political parties against the growing influence of the
Italian Communist Party.
   Moscow was giving the Italian Communists some $50 million a
year, he said, and ``it was unthinkable'' the United States would
let Italy fall under Soviet control.

   Officials involved in a secret European resistance
network underwent training at a U.S. base in West Germany in the
1970s, according to confidential documents obtained Friday.
   The documents also disclosed that French and British officials
involved in the network visited a training base built with U.S.
money to train Italian members of Operation Gladio, as the
resistance network is known.
   The documents sum up secret judicial testimony by Italian
officials and indicate a higher level of European coordination in
the anti-Communist network than had been revealed.
   They also were the first official corroboration of reports that
the guerrilla organization existed in Britain.
   Also Friday, the German government announced that a branch of
the secret organization still exists in that country, and will be
dissolved.
   The guerrilla groups were formed throughout Europe after World
War II by secret services to create a resistance movement or gather
intelligence in the event of a Warsaw Pact invasion.
   They were made up of civilians and coordinated at least in part
by NATO, according to officials who were involved. Some groups
received CIA funds, they say.
   An Italian parliamentary committee that oversees secret services
on Friday held a second day of closed hearings on Operation Gladio.
Premier Giulio Andreotti, who first disclosed the existence of the
network last month, testified.
   Two Venice judges, Carlo Mastelloni and Felice Casson, have been
investigating whether the network was linked to a series of
terrorist bombings in Italy from 1969 to the early 1980s, when the
Communists, Italy's No. 2 party, came to the brink of power.
   A military intelligence official who supervised the operation
from late 1971 to 1974 told Mastelloni that eight to 10 instructors
of the guerrillas went to the main U.S. base in West Germany in
1972. There, they took part in a ``simulated exercise'' of enemy
occupation, said Gen. Gerardo Serravalle.
   A summary of his secret testimony was obtained by The Associated
Press from a parliamentary source.
   According to the testimony, U.S. intelligence officials invited
the Italians back for another training exercise in 1974.
   Serravalle said an Italian training base was established on the
island of Sardinia in the 1960s under a secret NATO accord.
   The United States provided money for construction and for the
first arms shipments, which included pistols and magnesium and
plastic explosives, according to the testimony.
   Serravalle said Italian and British Gladio organizers exchanged
visits in 1972 and 1973, and that ``similar visits were made by two
French officials'' to the Italian base in 1974.
   The British government has refused to confirm the existence of a
domestic resistance network. On Friday, Defense Secretary Tom King
told reporters he had never heard of Gladio.
   French officials have said they had such a group but that it
withered away years ago.
   Serravalle said he attended meetings in Paris, London, Brussels
and Luxembourg of European officials involved in the network.
   His former superior, Gen. Fausto Fortunato, testified that
during his tenure, from 1971-74, the NATO committee overseeing the
resistance groups included France, Britain, Germany, Italy,
Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

   Germany, swamped by immigrants and newcomers from
all parts of the world, will assign 20 percent of all
asylum-seekers to the formerly Communist east starting in December,
officials said Friday.
   West Germany long was popular with refugees because of its
generous social benefits and liberal asylum laws crafted after
World War II. These now apply in former East German territory since
unification on Oct. 3.
   The 11 states in western Germany complain they cannot cope with
the growing numbers of asylum-seekers. They have demanded that Bonn
put some of the burden on the five new states in eastern Germany.
   The number of asylum-seekers in Germany is expected to top
200,000 this year. Fewer than 4 percent of the applicants are ever
expected to be granted refuge, but processing their applications
can take years.
   Although asylum-seekers are not allowed legally to work, they
are eligible for welfare benefits, including government-subsidized
housing while their cases are being decided.
   The Interior Ministry said Friday that each of the five new
states, Saxony, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Lower Pomerania,
Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia, must count on receiving 8,000 asylum
applicants a year starting Dec. 1.
   Although the western states say they can no longer cope, the new
eastern states face far more serious financial difficulties in
absorbing the newcomers.
   The Economics and Social Science Institute of the German Trade
Union says the local governments face a shortage of more than $66
billion to run their communities over the next four years.
   The eastern state of Saxony already has registered 31 refugees
from Romania, Poland, India, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey, but could
house them only in huts on the edge of town.
   The new states in eastern Germany also lack social counselors
and translators to help the asylum seekers adapt.
   The liberal asylum laws were drafted in West Germany after World
War II in light of the extermination of Jews, gypsies and
foreigners in Nazi death camps.
   Parliament has been reluctant to change the law on asylum to
avoid charges of intolerance.
   Foreigners entering Germany can immediately approach police and
demand asylum. They cannot be shipped back to any area of conflict
or spot where they could face political persecution.
   Many asylum-seekers are economic refugees.
   An influx of asylum-seekers in eastern Germany could cause
strains with the local population, which already faces uncertainty
because of the post-Communist economic crisis.
   Raised in a tightly controlled society, eastern Germans
generally are less tolerant to foreigners than their counterparts
in the west, where the notion of a multicultural society is heavily
promoted.
   The German government contends that with the opening of borders
in Europe, a Europe-wide solution is needed for the asylum problem.
   Bonn advocates additional economic aid, especially for the
emerging democracies in Eastern Europe, to encourage potential
asylum-seekers to stay home.
   Germany is especially worried about the possibility of a mass
influx of Soviet citizens fleeing economic chaos and hunger at home
once Moscow liberalizes travel laws.

   Police on Friday arrested more than 340
anti-abortion activists who tried to block entrances to two
abortion clinics.
   The protests organized by the anti-abortion group Operation
Rescue snarled morning commuter traffic near the clinics close to
the downtown area. District of Columbia police, wearing riot gear,
carried some demonstrators onto waiting buses.
   ``We will continue to save children, no matter what the courts
have to say,'' Operation Rescue spokesman Pat Mahoney said. ``The
sanctity and dignity of human life is what matters and we will be
here.''
   Police spokesmen were not immediately able to provide the
charges placed against the demonstrators.
   Some protesters carried signs reading ``O Great God: Close Down
This Killing Center!'' and ``Legalized Abortion is Legalized
Murder.''
   ``We fight abortion and we fight abortion until we die,'' said
Martha Allen, one of dozens of activists who lined a sidewalk
across the street from one clinic. She and others on the sidewalk
were not arrested because they did not directly impede access to
the clinic.
   Randall Terry, the head of Operation Rescue, said as many as
1,000 people were expected to participate in the Washington area
demonstrations Friday and Saturday.
   Members of the local branch of the National Organization for
Women and the Washington Area Clinic Defense Task Force held
counter-demonstrations at the sites.
   ``We're here because women's constitutional rights to health
care, to abortion, are denied when people blockade health care
facilities,'' said Hannah Olanoff, of NOW. ``We're here because we
want to see the law upheld.''
   At one of the clinics, a woman held a small banner up to a
second-story window, reading, ``This clinic is open.''
   Members of the pro-abortion rights groups said they were
prepared to escort women past the demonstrators. ``We're going to
keep this clinic open,'' said Sarah Enten, a member of the clinic
defense task force.
   Federal judges in the district, Virginia and Maryland have
issued permanent injunctions against Operation Rescue, Terry and
several of its other leaders to prevent them from blocking
entrances or exits to clinics and from organizing protests to
blockade clinics.

   Mayor Bill Stirling's two dogs might ave a
bone to pick with their master, who is raising the pets to be
strict vegetarians like himself.
   ``People are curious and amused at first because it is contrary
to the popular myth that dogs need to have meat to thrive,''
Stirling said.
   Stirling's household is bound to set the public straight. He
said he feeds his dogs carrots, celery, lettuce and new-age
commercial dog food that contains no animal products.
   Sterling says Glenda, a large malamute, and Emily, a Hungarian
sheep dog, ``are absolutely thriving, in perfect physical health.''
   Despite being carnivores, dogs can eat like rabbits and ``be
healthy on a vegetarian diet if it is done properly,'' said Aspen
veterinarian Scott Dolginow.
   Stirling said he and his wife, Katharine Thalberg, also avoid
leather in their wardrobes to maintain their vegetarian principles.
   Stirling and Thalberg promoted Aspen's proposed ban on fur sales
last February. Voters decisively defeated the ordinance.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Ron Reagan, son of the former president, is
getting his own syndicated late-night talk show, a spokesman for
the as-yet untitled weeknight series said Friday.
   The show, to be based in Los Angeles and co-produced by MCA-TV
and Fox Television Stations Inc., will be shown on the seven TV
stations owned by Fox, and syndicated to other stations.
   Each one-hour program will offer topical talk, comedy and
contemporary music in what the show's producers called a
``thematically-driven format.''
   Reagan, 32, left ABC's ``Good Morning America'' last summer
after four years as a contributing reporter.

   CLEVELAND (AP) - The emir of Bahrain is receiving medical care
at the Cleveland Clinic, according to a official of the Persian
Gulf country's embassy in Washington.
   The unidentified official told The Plain Dealer newspaper that
Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, 57, flew to Cleveland from Bahrain
on Wednesday for a routine checkup.
   The Cleveland Clinic is widely known for its coronary expertise
and past treatment of leaders from the Middle East. A State
Department official said the Arab leader suffered a heart attack
Oct. 14.
   Hospital officials on Friday refused to confirm the sheik's
visit.
   Bahrain is supporting the U.S. effort to oust Iraqi forces from
Kuwait.
   The Khalifa family has ruled the country since 1782. Sheik Isa
became emir in 1961.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Country singer Carlene Carter is
planning a sentimental journey with her father, Nashville crooner
Carl Smith, on a cable television program.
   Carter will perform the song ``You Are the One,'' which Smith
originally recorded in 1956 - the year she was born. Carter brought
back the tune this year by recording it for her hit album ``I Fell
in Love.''
   Smith, 63, who has not performed publicly for five years, also
will sing on the ``Nashville Now'' variety program Monday on The
Nashville Network. He will perform his 1971 song ``Red Door.''
   Susan Sizemore, a spokeswoman for the show, said Friday there
are no plans for them to sing together.
   Carter's mother is country music veteran June Carter Cash, now
married to country star Johnny Cash.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's waffling on taxes and refusal to
use the word ``invasion'' in describing events in Panama won him
the 1990 Doublespeak Award on Friday from the National Council of
Teachers of English.
   The group cited the president's pledge of ``no new taxes'' and
his later call for ``tax revenue increases'' as well as his
statements on maternity leave and foreign policy as the reasons for
naming him.
   The citation calls attention to statements by officials that are
``grossly deceptive, evasive, euphemistic, confusing or
self-contradictory,'' said William Lutz, chairman of the
organization's Committee on Public Doublespeak.
   Second place went to Mobil Corp. for calling one of its trash
bags ``photodegradable'' even while they're buried in landfills.
And third place went to Rep. Newt Gingrich, the House minority
whip, for supporting and then opposing tax increases.
   Before opposing Bush on the tax increase, the Georgia Republican
defended the president's stand on raising taxes by saying, ``He
very explicitly didn't say, `Raise taxes.' He said, `Seek new
revenues.'''
   The White House issued no response to the ``award'' Friday and a
telephone call to Gingrich's office elicited no immediate response.
   Mobil spokesman John Lord said the company never claimed the
bags would degrade in landfills. He said the company contended that
an environmentally safe additive speeded decomposition when the
bags were exposed to sunlight.
   He said Mobil had added the reference to ``degradability''
because of marketing pressures but later deleted the word because
of ``mounting confusion.''
   Bush's doublespeak included statements about maternity leave,
the teachers group said.
   During his campaign, he said, ``We ... need to assure that women
do not have to worry about getting their jobs back after having a
child or caring for a child during a serious illness.''
   But after his election, Bush vetoed the bill for parental and
medical leave. A White House statement said the president ``has
always been opposed to the federal government mandating what every
business in this country should do.''
   Lutz of Rutgers University also cited two examples of foreign
policy: the U.S. response to the June 1989 massacre in Beijing and
the December invasion of Panama.
   After the Tiananmen Square killings, Bush announced suspension
of U.S. ``participation in all high-level exchanges of government
officials'' with China. Two weeks later, Bush secretly sent
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger to China, Lutz said.
   Bush called the trip a ``contact,'' not an ``exchange,'' and
resumed negotiations for arms sales to China.
   Lutz also said Bush refused to refer to the U.S. mission in
Panama as an invasion, saying he ``deployed forces'' in Operation
Just Cause. But at a Dec. 21 news conference, Bush said: ``You
could say, `How come you didn't tell me that you were going to
invade the - send in those troops down into Panama?'''
   The group also awarded Charlotte Baecher, author of ``Selling
America's Kids: Commercial Pressures on Kids of the '90s,'' the
committee's 1990 George Orwell Award for Honesty and Clarity in
Public Language.

<TEXT>
   Hungary, which has urged the Warsaw
Pact to disband, said Friday it is unilaterally scrapping its
Soviet-made ground-to-ground missiles, all capable of carrying
nuclear warheads.
   The Defense Ministry, which made the announcement, also gave
figures on the number of such missiles in other Warsaw Pact nations
and said Hungary's destruction of the weapons will be completed by
the spring.
   The decision, made at Thursday's Cabinet session, was taken to
reflect the reduction of East-West tensions and changes within the
Warsaw Pact, a government statement said, alluding to the pact's
de-facto termination as a Soviet-led military organization.
   Hungary has made it clear that it believes the Warsaw Pact no
longer serves a useful purpose, so it was not surprising that it
became the first member to unilaterally scrap its missiles.
   Col. Gyoergy Keleti, a Defense Ministry spokesman, repeated the
government stance that Hungary plans to leave the military part of
pact next year if it is not dissolved by then. Hungarian officials
said on Thursday that the six-nation pact had agreed to terminate
its military role by July.
   The army's 24 SCUD-B tactical missiles have a range of 180
miles. Its 107 FROG-7 missiles can travel 50 miles.
   Hungary's 27 mobile launchers also will be dismantled, and the
3,200-strong missile unit of soldiers will be retrained for other
duties, Keleti said.
   He told reporters that the Soviet Union had 1,200 of the two
kinds of missiles; Czechoslovakia 75; Romania 50; Bulgaria more
than 70, and Poland 80.
   NATO and Warsaw Pact negotiators reached agreement in Vienna on
Thursday on cutting conventional arms in Europe.
   Keleti told reporters that Hungary had been allotted 835 tanks,
1,700 armored vehicles, 840 artillery pieces, 180 fighter planes
and 108 combat helicopters under the overall Warsaw Pact ceiling.
   Keleti, reacting to recent Soviet statements that the
withdrawing Red Army ``no longer'' has nuclear weapons in Hungary,
said the Soviets in the past had denied having nuclear weapons in
their Hungarian arsenal.
   Under troop cuts that began last year, Hungary's armed forces
will number 80,000 by December, down from 106,800.

   Sen. Alan Cranston actively solicited
contributions from savings and loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. at
times when Keating wanted help with federal banking regulators, the
Senate Ethics Committee's special counsel charged today.
   Cranston denied any wrongdoing. ``I engaged in no unethical
conduct,'' he told the committee. ``You know that I broke no law.''
   Cranston, who is ill with prostate cancer, made his first
appearance in two days of hearings. He spoke after two other
members under investigation, John McCain, R-Ariz., and John Glenn,
D-Ohio, issued similar declarations of innocence.
   Still to be heard were Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Don
Riegle, D-Mich. All five are under investigation for their links to
Keating, whose Lincoln Savings and Loan failed at an estimated cost
to taxpayers of $2 billion.
   Earlier, committee counsel Robert S. Bennett outlined his case
against Cranston.
   ``On approximately four separate occasions Senator Cranston
accepted or solicited several hundred thousand dollars from Mr.
Keating'' for his campaigns or voter registration drives to which
he was closely associated, Bennett said.
   ``Each of these four occasions was linked by time and
circumstance to a request by Mr. Keating for assistance'' with
federal bank regulators, Bennett said.
   When his turn came, McCain told the committee: ``I know I acted
ethically and properly and in compliance with all applicable
standards of conduct, including my own.''
   And Glenn testified that, ``at no time did I ask for special
treatment for anyone and at no time did I trade favors or perform
actions in return for money.''
   Cranston told the committee that, ``You know that I pocketed no
money - that there was no personal gain for me or any member of my
family. ... I never recommended, much less demanded, that any
government official do anything improper or grant any constituent
any special favor.''
   ``Yes, I was persistent in expressing my concerns about the way
bureaucrats were dealing with this large business in my state,'' he
said, referring to Lincoln, which was chartered in California. ``I
believed that its failure, if it came to that ... would be a
catastrophe for countless constituents of mine.''
   The day's hearing began on a dramatic note when Cranston's
lawyer asked that one of the six committee members, Sen. Jesse
Helms, be barred from judging the California Democrat.
   Helms, speaking under oath, stoutly denied the charge by
Cranston attorney William W. Taylor III that he had already made up
his mind in the case. He refused to step aside and the hearings
continued.
   Bennett pointed to Cranston's own words, in a deposition taken
by Ethics Committee lawyers, in which the senator freely
acknowledged Keating's access to him was ``in part because of his
substantial contributions.''
   ``During his deposition, Senator Cranston said, `A person who
makes a contribution has a better chance to get access than someone
who does not,''' Bennett recounted.
   Bennett said Keating made a $100,000 contribution to a voter
registration project associated with Cranston on March 3, 1987,
less than a month before Cranston and other senators met with top
bank regulator Edwin Gray on behalf of Keating.
   That fall, Keating gave another $250,000, and six days later
Cranston called Gray's successor, Danny Wall. Bennett cited a memo
to Cranston from one of his fund-raisers, who said Wall's
appointment was ``good news'' for Keating. The same memo said,
``You should ask Keating for $250,000.''
   At the time, Keating was seeking to have bank regulators waive a
rule limiting risky investments by Lincoln.
   Bennett depicted Cranston as aggressively seeking contributions
from Keating.
   ``It was very clear Senator Cranston solicited contributions and
sought contributions from Mr. Keating,'' Bennett said.
   Bennett drew repeated expressions of irritation from Ethics
Chairman Howell Heflin, who suggested Bennett was singling out
Cranston when many senators request contributions from donors. At
one point, when Bennett insisted he was being evenhanded, Heflin
interjected, ``Selectively.''
   Heflin reminded Bennett he was not a prosecutor but was there to
assist in collecting facts.
   Bennett replied: ``I'm not tilting the facts, Mr. Chairman. The
facts tilt.''
   The panel is looking into any connections between $1.3 million
in donations Keating made to the five men or their favored causes,
and their efforts to intervene with federal regulators looking at
the savings and loan.
   Bennett was expected to finish his presentation when the panel
reconvened today, but Taylor first sought to have Helms recuse
himself.
   He cited reports from Helms' recent, successful re-election
campaign in which the North Carolina Republican had referred to
Cranston as ``the leading water carrier'' for Keating.
   ``It appears to me that a reasonable person would conclude that
Senator Helms has not only made up his mind about the issue but
that he has already said so,'' said Taylor.
   Helms acknowledged making the remarks, and said he did so after
his Democratic opponent in the campaign received a contribution
from Cranston's political action committee.
   ``Senator Cranston injected himself into that campaign, and I
was entitled to try to eject him. I make no apology for what I said
because it was true,'' Helms said.
   ``Neither Senator Cranston's partisanship nor mine will play any
role in my decision,'' Helms said. ``If the weight of evidence
shows that Senator Cranston has indeed brought discredit upon the
Senate I will vote accordingly. If the evidence shows otherwise, I
will base my decision upon that.''

   It was a balmy 71 degrees, but the scent of
Christmas was in the air Friday as a 75-foot-high Norway spruce was
hoisted into place at Rockefeller Center.
   The Christmas tree, the 58th erected in front of the skating
rink and above the gilded sculpture of Prometheus, will be the main
attraction for millions of holiday revelers.
   During the next two weeks, crews will decorate the huge spruce
with 20,000 multi-colored lights that will blink to life Dec. 3 at
a ceremony led by Liza Minnelli.
   This year's tree was donated by Charles Cenci of Norwalk, Conn.,
in honor of Cenci's father, who planted the tree in his front yard
61 years ago when it was 6 inches tall.
   ``I figured a lot of people would enjoy it,'' Cenci said
Thursday as crews prepared to cut it down.
   Cenci's sister, Shirley, said their father would have been proud
to see the tree become one of New York City's holiday centerpeces.
   ``I almost cried about 10 times today,'' Ms. Cenci said as she
searched the ground for fallen branches to place in a basket to
adorn her parents' graves at Christmas.
   The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree tradition began in 1931,
when construction workers, grateful for employment during the
Depression, erected a small tree to celebrate the holiday.
   This year's evergreen was put in place on one of the warmest
mornings in weeks, 71 degrees and one degree below the 1928 record
for the date, the National Weather Service said.

Mismanagement</HEAD>

   Rep. Guy Vander Jagt's challenger for the top
House Republican campaign post is charging financial mismanagement
of the multimillion-dollar committee and raising questions about
payoffs to its employees.
   The challenger, Rep. Don Sundquist of Tennessee, has challenged
Vander Jagt in a letter to account for money the National
Republican Congressional Committee has raised and spent over the
past decade. Copies of the letter were circulated to all House
Republicans on Thursday.
   Sundquist's letter to the Michigan congressman notes that the
NRCC raised $28.5 million in the two-year election cycle leading up
to the Nov. 6 voting, finished the period $2.5 million in debt and
funneled only 7 percent of the money directly to candidates.
   ``I have serious concerns about the financial management of the
committee,'' wrote Sundquist, R-Tenn.
   Sundquist's letter posed 16 detailed questions to Vander Jagt,
including whether the committee has rules against its employees
receiving ``commissions, royalties, dividends, consulting fees,
expensive gifts, the use of vacation homes or other rewards'' from
committee consultants or vendors.
   Gary Koops, a spokesman for the NRCC, said the committee is
audited annually and all its contributions and spending are
documented in reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.
   ``If he were serious about getting answers, he'd go look at
those reports,'' Koops said of Sundquist. He said Vander Jagt has
helped build the organization rom one with a $750,000 budget in
1975 to a $15-20 million annual operation now, with 1.3 million
active donors.
   The toughly worded challenge came just a week after House
elections in which the Republicans lost a net of nine seats and
sank to their lowest level of strength in the chamber since 1982.
   Sundquist asked that Vander Jagt, R-Mich., reply to the
questions by Nov. 27 so lawmakers can know the answers before they
vote for NRCC chief. Vander Jagt has held the post for 14 years.
   The 167 Republicans in the 102nd Congress that convenes in
January will meet at the Capitol in early December to choose their
leaders for the coming two years. The race for chairman of the NRCC
is the hottest of those contests.
   Sundquist began contacting colleagues a week before the
elections and asking them to support him for the post.
   The move came on the heels of a highly publicized snit between
the White House and Ed Rollins, Vander Jagt's chief operative at
the committee, over an NRCC memo telling Republican House
candidates it was OK to oppose President Bush's stand on the
federal budget.
   A supporter of Vander Jagt, House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich, sought
to portray Sundquist's challenge as inspired by the White House as
a vendetta against Rollins, but Sundquist has denied it.
   ``There was never a meeting, note, conversation or contact with
the White House,'' said Sundquist spokesman Ralph Perrey. ``This
effort is coming from House members who are concerned about the way
the committee has been run.''

   A man accused in the deaths of two
hikers who were shot and stabbed as they slept in a remote area of
the Appalachian Trail has agreed to return to Pennsylvania to face
charges.
   Paul David Crews of Loris, S.C., a suspect in at least one other
murder, waived extradition from West Virginia Thursday.
   ``I gave him the options; he made the decision,'' said Jerome
Dambro, the public defender appointed to represent Crews. ``He
decided it was his best interest to face the charges in
Pennsylvania.'
   Authorities suspect Crews in the Sept. 13 slayings of Geoffrey
Logan Hood and Molly LaRue near Duncannon, Pa.
   Ms. LaRue, 25, of Shaker Heights, Ohio, and Hood, 26, of Signal
Mountain, Tenn., were hiking along the 2,160-mile trail, which runs
from Maine to Georgia. They were found dead in their sleeping bags.
   Crews was arrested Sept. 21 in Harpers Ferry. Authorities said
he was wearing one of the hiker's boots and carrying one of their
backpacks.
   He told police that his name was David ``Casey'' Horn and signed
that name to his extradition papers. But FBI officials in Florida
identified him as Crews, who also is sought in the 1986 slashing
death of Clemmie Jewel Arnold of Bartow, Fla.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three landlords of a building that housed a
social club where 87 people were killed in a March arson fire are
not criminally liable for the blaze, a prosecutor has decided.
   Bronx District Attorney Robert T. Johnson made the announcement
Thursday after a hearing for Julio Gonzalez, who was charged with
178 counts of murder, arson and related crimes.
   During the court appearance before state Justice Burton B.
Roberts, Gonzalez's lawyer, Richard Berne, repeated his plan to use
the an insanity defense.
   Gonzalez was accused of splashing gasoline inside the club's
entrance March 25 before lighting it and causing the blaze.
   Immediately after the fire, much discussion focused on whether
the building's landlords could be charged in connection with the
fire.
   But Johnson said an extensive investigation had determined that
Alex DiLorenzo, whose corporation owned the property, and Jay Weiss
and Morris Jaffe, leaseholders and managing agents, were not
criminally liable.
   The prosecutor said defects and safety violations ``contributed
substantially'' to the harm caused by the fire.
   He said the three landlords took at least some steps ``however
ineffectually'' to try to fix the violations, including demanding
that the club be closed and attempting to evict the tenant who was
staging them.
   ``Thus, there is insufficient proof that their behavior rises to
the level of criminal conduct,'' he said.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovaks on Friday excitedly
awaited President Bush's arrival on a history-making visit
coinciding with the first anniversary of the ``Velvet Revolution''
that toppled communist rule.
   On the eve of its first-ever U.S. presidential visit, Prague
officially renamed its railway station in honor of President
Woodrow Wilson, who encouraged a much earlier Czechoslovak push for
independence.
   The simple ceremony, said Praque Mayor Jaroslav Koran, was a
fitting prelude to a presidential visit that would ``complete the
magic circle'' of U.S.-Czechoslovak relations. ``As if with a
message from our ancestors,'' he said, ``the president will visit
for the first time ever.''
   Within the citadels of power in the post-Cold War Prague
government and among the populace at large, excitement - even
exhileration - was in the air.
   ``It's perfect,'' 24-year-old medical student Tomas Sklenar said
of the timing of Bush's visit. ``American democracy is the greatest
ideal,'' exulted Karel Kren, who also is studying medicine.
   In anticipation of Bush's arrival Saturday, Czechoslovaks donned
buttons showing a smiling U.S. president with the inscription,
``Thank You!'' American flags fluttered in the breeze, mounted on
elegant buildings alongside Czechoslovakia's national flag of
matching red, white and blue.
   ``It's good he's coming on Nov. 17,'' said Zdenek Matejovsky, a
32-year-old waiter, who waived the American flag and then impishly
hid his face behind a mask of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Bush's trip comes at a period of substantially improved
relations between Washington and Prague. Only a week ago, the
president signed legislation extending most-favored-nation trade
status. Bush at the time called the measure ``an important
milestone not only in U.S.-Czechoslovak relations, but also in
re-integration into the global economy and the community of free
nations.''
   Earlier this fall, in a meeting in New York with Czech President
Vaclav Havel, Bush announced he was lifting travel restrictions on
Czechoslovakia's diplomats in the United States. Three months
earlier, U.S. officials said that Prague had agreed to accept U.S.
Peace Corps volunteers.
   Bush hosted Havel at the White House, and the playwright and
former prisoner under the communist regime, addressed a joint
meeting of Congress.
   On Friday, Czechoslovak officials restored Wilson's place in
this country's history, cementing ties that stretch back to when
Wilson helped his friend Tomas G. Masaryk gain Czech and Slovak
independence from the crumbling Austro-Hungarian Empire.
   Wilson recognized Masaryk's ``de facto government'' set up in
U.S. exile before independence. Masaryk, a philosopher and
acknowledged role model for Havel, became the first head of the new
state in 1918.
   Prague's main railway station was named after Wilson in
gratitude for his help. His name was dropped after the communists
seized power in 1948, but remained customary for Prague residents.
   ``Wilson's station has never stopped being Wilson's station ...
even when frightened (Communist) rulers tried to wipe out all
reference to the connections of our history with the ideals of
American democracy,'' Koran said at the renaming ceremony.
   Czechs and Slovaks, like many other East Europeans, looked to
America as a model of democracy during their four decades of
authoritarian communist rule. The turbulent history of this century
has given Czechoslovaks added reason to admire America.
   Caught on the crossroads of Europe, the two Slav nations have
traditionally looked both East and West in their effort to win and
preserve independence.
   Embittered by Stalinist repressions in the 1950s and the Warsaw
Pact invasion that crushed communist-led reform in 1968,
Czechoslovaks have lost any love for the Soviets, who liberated the
country from the Nazis at the end of World War II.
   The betrayal of the 1938 Munich agreement by which Britain and
France allowed Nazi Germany to annex one-third of Czechoslovakia's
territory soured relations with the British and French.
   Nazi occupation fanned Czech hatred of the Germans, who
historically sought to dominate the Czech lands. After World War
II, Czechoslovakia brutally expelled about 2.5 million ethnic
Germans.
   These clouded relationships with other Western nations adds to
the respect for America which found voice on the streets of Prague
Friday.
   ``I know that in America he's not very popular with the budget
deficit and some other problems,'' Sklenar said, but Mr. Reagan
(former President Ronald) could not come here, so it's perfect that
Mr. Bush does.''
   The Czechoslovaks have said that Bush asked to attend Saturday's
anniversary.
   ``We are happy!'' a banner draped from a balcony proclaimed.

   The Marine Corps is beefing up its ground
assault strength in Saudi Arabia by equipping a reinforcement unit
with new M1-A1 battle tanks, officials said Friday.
   The two Marine tank battalions already in the Persian Gulf area
are equipped with 1960s-designed M60 tanks, which are lighter and
not as well protected.
   The Marines decided shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2
to speed up a previously planned switch from the M60 tanks to the
M1-A1, the most modern U.S. battle tank, said Lt. Col. Ron Stokes,
a Marine Corps spokesman.
   Similarly, the Army recently began substituting M1-A1s held in
storage in Europe for its older M1 tanks deployed in Saudi Arabia,
and it is expected to have more than 1,000 of the top-of-the-line
tanks in the area by the end of the year.
   Iraq has about 3,500 tanks in and around Kuwait, according to
the Pentagon. However, only about 600 are believed to be the
modern, Soviet-designed T-72 model.
   Strokes said the 2nd Tank Battalion, now being trained on the
M1-A1 in the United States, will deploy to the gulf with 58 of the
modern tanks as part of a huge wave of Marine reinforcements for
Operation Desert Shield over the next several weeks.
   The approximately 45,000 Marines in Saudi Arabia and afloat on
amphibious assault ships have about 140 M60 tanks. There are no
immediate plans to switch those to M1-A1s.
   The Marines had been scheduled to start getting M1-A1s next
February or March, but the gulf build-up led Marine Corps leaders
to speed up the transition, Stokes said.
   Besides being shielded with better armor than older tanks, the
M1-A1's 120mm gun provides greater firepower and its
``overpressure'' system provides more protection against attack
from chemical, biological or nuclear agents.

<DATELINE>HIGHLAND, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Skeletal remains found in a farm field
were those of a missing Missouri woman, and a man charged in the
slaying of another woman was tied to both deaths, officials said.
   The remains found Sunday in the northeast Kansas field were
identified Thursday as those of Patricia Diane Rose, 31, of St.
Joseph.
   An autopsy showed she died of blows to the head, said St. Joseph
police spokesman Sgt. Jim Connors.
   The body of Crystal Lynn Simmons, 33, also of St. Joseph, was
found in the field Monday about 400 yards from the remains of Ms.
Rose. Ms. Simmons also died of blows to the head, officials said.
   Marvin L. Irvin, 41, was charged with murder in Ms. Simmons'
death. Authorities said he probably also will be charged with a
second count.
   ``We have both physical and witness evidence that would link
(Irvin) with Ms. Rose,'' said Dwight Scroggins, the Buchanan
County, Mo., prosecutor.
   The farm where the women were buried is near property once owned
by Irvin's family.
   Authorities say Irvin also was a suspect in the disappearance of
another St. Joseph woman, Micki Jo West, 19, who has been missing
since 1979.
   Irvin was held without bond in Buchanan County on a parole
violation charge in Iowa. He was convicted in 1988 of threatening a
Jefferson, Iowa, woman.
   Irvin's attorney sought a gag order Thursday to prevent St.
Joseph police and prosecutors from commenting on the case to the
media.
   ``We think it's endangering our client's right to a fair
trial,'' said Buchanan County public defender Timothy D. Ernst.
``There are allegations of other crimes ... he has not been charged
with.''
   A hearing on the gag order was set for Wednesday in Buchanan
County.
   Patricia Rose's sister, Vickie Fadden, said her family was
relieved that their waiting was over.
   ``I feel that we are lucky that they found her,'' Fadden said.
``We don't have to worry about her like the family of Micki Jo West
must have for all of these years.''
   Police said they would continue searching for other remains.

<TEXT>
   Twelve new governors are learning the ins
and outs of their offices from their veteran colleagues during a
National Governors' Association seminar.
   ``It's the nuances of how you deal with your schedule, how you
involve your spouse, how you use state facilities, how you deal
with security,'' Washington Gov. Booth Gardner explained to
reporters Friday.
   The organization held its first seminar in 1968 and has held one
every two years since. This session began Thursday and continues
through Sunday.
   ``They seem excited,'' Gardner said while the closed-door
training sessions were conducted. ``My view is governors today are
more and more coming in with a broader background and a greater
realization that a government is a service organization.''
   He added that new governors coming from the private sector must
learn to include constituents in the decision-making process.
   ``When you realize that you represent the entire public,'' he
said, ``you owe it to the entire public to allow them access to
government and an opportunity to be heard.''
   The seminar's host, Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, said he
missed out on a seminar because he was elected in 1987, during an
off year.
   Wilkinson urged the new governors to ``retain that vision that
you communicated so well'' while campaigning.
   Gardner stressed the importance of a good relationship between a
governor and the legislature. He said a legislative liaison is
``perhaps the most important hire they can have after a scheduler.
   ``Anything you want to do in terms of vision or planning is
dependent on your ability to access successfully with the
legislatures and get legislation passed,'' he said.
   Governors-elect attending the meeting are from Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney extended a
freeze on most military construction on the same day that President
Bush empowered him to bypass Congress for authority to start
building projects related to Operation Desert Shield.
   The Pentagon announced Friday that Cheney had extended the
construction freeze before it expired at midnight Thursday. It
applies to all military building projects except those related to
Desert Shield and those required for certain base closings.
   Cheney first imposed the freeze Jan. 24 in light of planned
changes in the structure and size of U.S. military forces and
because of expected base closings.
   The extended freeze is effective until April 16, 1991. In a
statement, Cheney said it was necessary because of ``continuing
changes in the world situation'' and limits on defense funds.
   On Thursday, Bush invoked emergency powers authorizing Cheney to
undertake construction projects in the Persian Gulf without advance
approval from Congress.
   The Pentagon has not said how many construction projects it
plans in the gulf, where more than 230,000 U.S. troops are deployed
and about 200,000 more are being sent in response to Iraq's
invasion and annexation of Kuwait.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a senior member of the House
Armed Services Committee and chairwoman of the subcommittee on
military installations and facilities, criticized the Bush
administration for holding up projects already approved by Congress
while bypassing Congress to start others.
   ``On the same day the secretry is deciding to cancel all
military construction worldwide for another five months,'' Bush
authorized the use of $6 billion in military construction funds for
Persian Gulf projects ``without permitting any congressional
oversight,'' she said Friday.

<HEAD>Dead Horse Advertisement Banned On Grounds It's Too Shocking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have banned an animal welfare group's
advertisement showing a dead horse dangling by its neck from a meat
hook on the grounds that it is too shocking.
   The double-page advertisement of the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals appeared in The Times of London,
The Independent and other newspapers on Thursday.
   Its aim was to win support for preventing the export of horses
for slaughter to other European nations in 1992, when the 12-nation
European Common Market is to abolish trade barriers.
   After the ad was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority,
it was run Friday by the London-based Guardian newspaper, with a
blank space where the picture of the horse had been.
   The caption read: ``Unfortunately the photograph that should
accompany the text opposite was withdrawn at the request of the
Advertising Standards Authority.''
   A spokesman for the watchdog group said it ordered the ban
because the ad ``was likely to cause unnecessary offense and
distress to the public.''
   Horse meat is virtually never eaten by Britons, but it is a
regular part of the diet among French and other continental
Europeans.
   The text with the advertisement read: ``The continentals love
freshly butchered horse meat. When are we going to supply it?
   ``Sadly, we are going to supply it after 1992. Because in 1992,
it will once again become legal to transport live British horses to
the continent for slaughter.'' The ad said the export was banned 30
years ago on the grounds of cruelty to animals.
   Earlier this year, the animal protection group shocked many
newspaper readers with advertisements showing a pile of dead dogs
to try to win support for a dog registration scheme to reduce the
number of strays. The Advertising Standards Authority did not
criticize that ad.
   But Caroline Crawford, the authority's spokeswoman, said it
intervened in the latest case because ``this particular
advertisement, we felt, was likely to cause unnecessary offense and
distress to the public at large.''
   Gavin Grant of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals countered that the ``seriousness and importance of the
subject matter unarguably warranted such an approach.''
   ``Three-quarters of a million live British animals, including
sheep, already travel for more than a day without food and water,
often arriving exhausted, battered or dead ... The prospect of
horses joining that is appalling,'' Grant told British Broadcasting
Corp. radio.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Gaston Caperton undergoes wild
mood swings and at times becomes so depressed that he cancels his
day's schedule, said an ex-aide who Caperton fired earlier this
week after a shoving match.
   G.C. Morse, a former press aide, said Caperton ``has some
problems but I don't know exactly what they are.''
   ``All I know is that they are causing great harm to the state
and himself. There are some dark things happening,'' Morse was
quoted as saying in Friday's The Herald-Dispatch of Huntington.
   Morse said Caperton's ``mood swings are incredible. ... There
have been days when he came into his office and decided he didn't
want to do anything, so his schedule would simply be wiped off.''
   Caperton's communications director, Bob Brunner, dismissed
Morse's comments as coming from ``a bitter and disillusioned
ex-employee'' who ``is trying to taint an entire administration
with his own ineptitude.''
   Morse, 41, and Caperton, 50, shoved one another Wednesday after
Morse was fired from a $58,000-a-year job as a position paper
writer for the Division of Energy.
   Morse, a distant cousin of the governor's, said he challenged
Caperton on reasons the governor was giving for firing Larry
George, the former energy commissioner, and that prompted the
pushing. The incident ended when a state trooper grabbed Morse.
   George said he was dismissed as energy commissioner in a
disagreement over the duties of the No. 2 man in the Division of
Energy, William Willis. Caperton described Willis as a personal
friend who has his wholehearted support.
   Caperton hired Morse in January to replace press secretary Steve
Cohen. Morse was ousted in August over a conflict in philosophy
with the governor. Morse transferred to the Division of Energy.
   Caperton, a millionaire businessman, defeated Gov. Arch A. Moore
Jr. in the 1988 election to win his first term. Caperton and his
first wife, Dee, ended their 23-year marriage in a messy divorce
last fall. In May, Caperton married Rachael Worby, conductor of the
Wheeling Symphony Orchestra.
   Morse said the changes are affecting Caperton's actions,
including a recent trip, and his opinions.
   ``I think there's something to the fact that he got all the way
to San Francisco last weekend on his trip to Japan, then turned
around and came back,'' Morse said. ``I know it was reported he was
physically ill, but when I saw him (Wednesday) morning, he
certainly didn't look ill to me.''

<TEXT>
   Thousands of tiny wasps were unleashed on a
Texas field this week as growers look for new ways to control a
pesticide-resistant caterpillar that leaves cabbage heads ``so full
of holes they look like lace.''
   Four species of wasps, some smaller than the head of a pin, were
sprinkled across a commercial field of cabbage in the Rio Grande
Valley on Thursday.
   If successful against the caterpillars, growers may see the
benefits of using the wasps on other crops such as broccoli,
cauliflower and kale, said Don Nordlund, a research entomologist at
the USDA's Agricultural Research Service in Weslaco, Texas.
   Because consumers also want more pesticide-free produce, ``we
may be able to start convincing growers to switch to this approach
after this first crop,'' Nordlund said Friday.
   He said caterpillars of the diamondback moth - the cabbage
patch's worst insect enemy - are resistant to almost all available
insecticides.
   Insects have been used to control pests on the Valley's citrus
and sugar cane crops, but Nordlund said wasps have never been
tested on a commercial cabbage crop in Texas. Growers showed little
interest when wasps were tried elsewhere in the early 1970s, and
the diamondback moth has since become resistant to pesticides.
   According to entomologist K. Duane Biever of the Agricultural
Research Service's fruit and vegetable research unit in Yakima,
Wash., the wasps lay eggs inside the caterpillars.
   ``The larvae that hatch from those eggs feed off their
caterpillar host, eventually killing it,'' he said. The wasps,
however, do not sting people or animals.
   Biever said the nipping and gnawing pests cause more than $35
million in damage annually to cabbage crops nationwide.
   The caterpillars leave cabbage heads ``so full of holes they
look like lace,'' said M.A. Maedgen Jr., president of Biofac, the
Texas company that supplies the wasps.

<HEAD>Stormie's Cause of Death: Heart Rejection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TARA BRADLEY-STECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudden heart rejection caused the death of
13-year-old Stormie Jones six years after she became the world's
first heart-liver transplant recipient, doctors said Friday.
   The autopsy results surprised Stormie's doctors, who said heart
rejection was rare so many years after a transplant.
   ``I've never seen it occur or reported in the literature,'' said
Dr. F. Jay Fricker, Stormie's cardiologist at Children's Hospital.
   ``No one expected to see any rejection in Stormie,'' he said.
``After all, we had a track record of more than six years of never
seeing any heart rejection. So why would we suddenly see it now?''
   Stormie died Sunday at Children's Hospital, where she had her
historic operation Feb. 14, 1984, after being rushed from her home
in White Settlement, Texas, with a sore throat and fever. She is to
be buried Saturday in her hometown.
   Fricker said it would take doctors months to determine, if at
all, what caused the sudden rejection.
   Doctors would not speculate about whether FK-506, an
experimental anti-rejection drug Stormie began receiving last
November, a second liver transplant underwent last February or
treatment for recurring hepatitis had anything to do with the
rejection.
   ``She was on the appropriate medications at the appropriate
dosages,'' said Dr. Jorge Reyes, a liver transplant surgeon. ``But,
obviously, if she developed a rejection she broke through these
medications.
   ``Each patient ... metabolizes drugs at different rates, and
their immune systems can be stimulated to different degrees,'' he
said. ``Particularly patients like Stormie, who had another process
ongoing - hepatitis, you have to balance it even further. It's not
an easy thing to do.''
   Stormie last had a heart checkup 11 months ago by her doctors in
Dallas and was scheduled to undergo another within the next few
months, Fricker said. The checkup showed no abnormalities, he said.
   The girl needed the transplant because of hypocholesteremia, a
rare genetic disorder that prevented her body from processing
cholesterol. Her sister, Misty, suffers from a milder form of the
disease.
   For five years after her first transplant, Stormie had few major
medical problems. Her setbacks began in October 1988, when she
returned to Pittsburgh for surgery to remove a bile duct
obstruction.
   She underwent a mild episode of liver rejection in November 1989
and began receiving FK-506, which is being tested at the University
of Pittsburgh, instead of the traditional anti-rejection drug
cyclosporine.
   A bout with hepatitis in February slowly damaged her liver,
requiring a second liver transplant. But post-surgery studies
showed no evidence of heart problems, Fricker said.
   Stormie began rejecting the second liver in May and was treated
with an increased FK-506 dosage. A month later, she received
medication to combat yet another bout of hepatitis.
   Recent flu-like symptoms were the only indication something was
wrong.
   ``If she had gotten here earlier, we would have suspected some
heart dysfunction ... and instituted appropriate treatment,''
Fricker said.
   Still, Reyes said he considered the double transplant a success.
   ``When you think ... that she lived for almost seven years, then
I think this was an inherent success because she had the
opportunity to live, to share things, not only with her family, but
the world.''

<HEAD>Bush Signs 8 Environmental Protection Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Friday signed into law a
bill barring U.S. mineral activities in Antarctica for the time
being, although his administration opposes a permanent ban.
   The Antarctic Protection Act of 1990 was one of eight measures
Bush signed Friday that are intended to also protect the
environment in the Florida Keys, Louisiana, New Jersey, the Nevada
desert and coastal regions, as well as provide money for global
warming research, clean up the Great Lakes and provide grants for
environmental education.
   The Antarctic law will ban indefinitely U.S. mineral activities
in the region until a new international minerals agreement is
approved by Congress. That agreement would first have to be worked
out by an international conference.
   Bush's action came three days before the start of a conference
in Chile where 24 countries will take up the future of Antarctica.
   Environmental groups have urged the president to commit the
United States to joining other nations, including France, Australia
and New Zealand, that want to make a permanently protected world
park in the frozen continent.
   U.S. officials say they oppose the permanent ban, urging instead
an international compact for a limited moratorium on oil drilling
and other minerals development.
   They said a long-term moratorium was the preferred middle ground
between those nations wanting to block mining forever and those,
like the United States, unwilling to rule it out.
   Environmentalists claim that the indefinite ban merely gives
industry time to prepare the technology for eventual development
and mining.
   But the White House touted Bush's action on Friday as
``advocating a forceful environmental protection agreement to
supplement the Antarctic Treaty'' that has been in effect since
1959.
   ``Clearly, all of us must work together to preserve America's
natural beauty,'' Bush said at a ceremony on the South Lawn of the
White House to sign the Antarctic bill and seven others.
   He also signed measures to:
   -Establish the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary,
designating 2,600 square miles off the keys as a national marine
sanctuary.
   -Establish national wildlife refuges in the 18,000-acre Bayou
Cocodrie in Louisiana and the 7,500-acre Walkill River area of New
Jersey, and fund additional marine research programs and stepped up
enforcement by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   -Designate 83,100 acres in southern Nevada's Mojave Desert as
the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation area.
   -Nearly triple the size of the Coastal Barrier Resource System
by adding 818,000 acres to the system along the atlantic, Gulf of
Mexico and Great Lakes coasts. The measure also limits federal
funds for development within the coastal barrier areas and requires
that any federal property in the coastal barrier regions be
transferred to the system.
   -Provide grants and training to teachers for environmental
education and create an office of environmental education at the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   -Fund research on the global warming trend. The administration,
bucking many of its allies, contends there is insufficient
scientific data to confirm that the earth is slowly warming due to
gaseous emissions. Rather than committing itself to a reduction of
those gases, the administration is putting more money into
research.
   -Assist in the cleanup of toxic pollution in the Great Lakes and
Lake Champlain.

<TEXT>
   Iran's foreign minister said Friday after
returning from Iraq that Saddam Hussein had not ruled out
withdrawing from Kuwait.
   The Iranian official, Ali Akbar Velayati, spoke in an interview
with Tehran television a day after returning from a two-day visit
to Baghdad. He met twice with his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz,
and once with Saddam.
   The lack of a joint communique by the nations, foes during the
1980-88 gulf war, indicated the talks were chilly.
   Asked about the effects of the U.N. economic sanctions, Velayati
said ``the Iraqi government itself did not try to conceal that the
sanctions have after all affected them.'' He did not elaborate.
   Velayati said it seemed Baghdad had not decided whether it would
keep Kuwait.
   ``One cannot say with certainty that it will go either way,
staying in Kuwait, and putting into practice the annexation of
Kuwait, or the withdrawal from Kuwait,'' he said in the television
interview, monitored in Nicosia.
   Velayati said he stressed that Iran believes international
borders are inviolable.
   ``We did not prevaricate. Although we preserved the positive
trend of our talks, we stressed to them our principle ... that as
the Islamic republic we recognized, and still recognize, Kuwait as
an independent country.''
   ``We believe that Kuwait's independence must be returned to
it,'' he said.
   Iran and Iraq remained enemies until August, when Saddam
unexpectedly agreed to Iran's conditions for a formal settlement of
the 1980-88 war. Analysts said he was seeking to pacify his eastern
flank to focus on the standoff with the U.S.-led multinational
forces deployed in the gulf region after Iraq seized Kuwait.
   Iran and Iraq reopened embassies in each other's capitals last
month.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he would fire government
and military officials blocking his reform plans and his chief
rival demanded the resignation of the central government to rescue
the economy and hold the Soviet Union together.
   Gorbachev spoke with hardly any applause to an angry Soviet
legislature that demanded an accounting of where his reforms were
going. Rival Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian federation,
then took the floor to urge that Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov
resign.
   The Gorbachev-Yeltsin power struggle showed the two leaders were
still far from resolving their differences and ending the paralysis
of power in the Soviet Union.
   Yeltsin had said after a private meeting wth Gorbachev on
Sunday that the two leaders would form committees to work out a
power-sharing agreement, creating hope for a unified effort to end
the country's economic crisis.
   But Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet legislature that Sunday's
meeting was merely ``routine,'' and he refused to give the Russian
leader more national power.
   Dropping his usually robust voice to a near-whisper in the
cavernous chamber, Gorbachev said, ``In a coalition government, if
the Russian government gets any more power, it will mean
discrimination against the other republics.''
   Yeltsin sat stone-faced through Gorbachev's speech. He later
took the floor and demanded that Gorbachev agree within two weeks
to form a new ``extraordinary anti-crisis committee'' that would
govern in place of Ryzhkov and his Council of Ministers.
   The committee, which would amount to a new Cabinet, would
include representatives of all 15 republics. It would take
immediate steps to provide more food for the country, buying it
from the West if necessary, Yeltsin said.
   ``The economic and political crisis in the country has come to a
head,'' he told the 542-member Supreme Soviet. ``The people's
patience has ended, and an explosion could occur at any time.''
   Facing a disintegrating economy and secessionist movements in
several republics, the lawmakers abandoned their agenda on
Wednesday and demanded that Gorbachev report to them on the state
of the union - and on his relations with Yeltsin.
   Yeltsin was dropped from the Communist Party Politburo in 1987
after criticizing Gorbachev's reforms as too slow. He has been the
president's chief political rival for more than a year, and
consistently ranks above Gorbachev in public opinion polls.
   The two agreed in August to cooperate on economic reforms. But
the agreement collapsed and their power struggle intensified last
month, when Gorbachev won the Supreme Soviet's approval for a
compromise economic reform plan.
   The Russian parliament, headed by Yeltsin, vowed to push ahead
with a more radical plan to switch to a free market in 500 days,
starting Nov. 1.
   Since then, Gorbachev's national government and the Russian
parliament have issued conflicting orders that have effectively
stopped either from advancing their programs.
   Yeltsin was elected earlier this year as president of the
Russian republic, which includes two-thirds of the Soviet land
mass, about half its 285 million people and huge mineral wealth.
But the Kremlin still controls the nation's finances and its
economic and military policy.
   Gorbachev's 90-minute address received a generally cool
reception in the legislative hall, which was packed with visiting
military and republic leaders.
   Soviet television broadcast the speech in full, but did not
carry Yeltsin's remarks.
   Gorbachev admitted that the country faces critical shortages at
the start of winter, but he insisted the government has adequate
plans to maintain supplies. He lashed out at ``disruptive forces
that hinder the consolidation of society and the country's exit
from the crisis.''
   He told the lawmakers he would replace some military and
government officials who were blocking his economic reforms. He
said the plan to ``get rid of outdated, clearly useless
structures'' would be submitted to the legislature within 10 days.
   Gorbachev did not spell out the changes but said they had the
approval of Ryzhkov - indicating that the embattled prime minister
would not be among those replaced.
   Gorbachev also promised changes ``in the top echelon of the
armed forces command.''
   He rejected persistent rumors of a military coup and, pounding
the lectern, said people were spreading rumors to discredit the
army. ``We cannot discredit the armed forces because we need them
now to maintain stability in the country,'' he said.
   Gorbachev's plans for developing a market economy hinge on the
republics remaining in the union, and he has proposed a treaty that
would give them a degree of autonomy while leaving national
economic and military power in Kremlin hands.
   Nearly all the republics and many smaller regions have declared
some form of sovereignty from the Kremlin. The Baltic states,
Georgia and the Ukraine have said they will not sign the union
treaty.
   ``The president cannot be just on his own, just as you cannot
settle many questions without his participation and without his
powers,'' Gorbachev pleaded. ``Let's act together.''
   A few deputies applauded that statement, but they did not clap
at the end.
   Gorbachev left the floor without answering questions, and
deputies took microphones to complain that he had not addressed
their concerns about the economy.

<DATELINE>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state representative charged in an
alleged check-kiting scheme became the fourth Missouri legislator
this year to be indicted on federal charges.
   A grand jury in Kansas City on Thursday indicted four-term Rep.
Henry Rizzo, D-Kansas City, who ran unopposed for re-election last
week and easily won. His brother, John T. Rizzo, and a former
business associate, Raymond E. Agee, also were indicted.
   U.S. Attorney Jean Paul Bradshaw, a Republican, said Rizzo's
indictment on 17 felony counts of fraud was unrelated to his work
as a legislator.
   Rizzo, 37, disagreed.
   ``I guess it's the year of the politician,'' he said Thursday
after being released on a signature bond. ``I think this was ...
brought because I am a Democrat and an elected official.''
   Bradshaw said Rizzo and his co-defendants face identical charges
of writing bad checks from May to August 1989 on accounts from two
defunct businesses they managed.
   Rizzo said he is innocent.
   ``It was a business. It went out of business, and we did the
best we could with it. It was a bad situation but it was certainly
not criminal,'' he said.
   Earlier this year, two other Democratic lawmakers, Rep. E.J.
``Lucky'' Cantrell of St. Louis and Sen. Ed Quick of Kansas City,
were tried by Bradshaw's office on felony labor corruption charges.
   Quick was acquitted. Cantrell, who was found guilty of
conspiring to steal union money, has appealed and is awaiting
sentencing.
   Federal prosecutors in St. Louis won three federal felony drug
convictions during the summer against Rep. Dewey Crump, D-Maryland
Heights. He is due to be sentenced Nov. 30.
   Cantrell and Crump lost re-election bids Nov. 6. Quick's seat is
not up for election until 1992.
   House Speaker Bob Griffin, D-Cameron, said Rizzo's indictment
wouldn't help the Legislature's image. ``It's not the greatest year
we've ever had,'' he said.
   House Ethics Committee Chairman Doug Harpool, D-Springfield,
said Rizzo's indictment was ``still another shadow'' over the
Legislature.
   A House member convicted of a felony faces expulsion upon
sentencing. Harpool said his committee also can recommend that the
House suspend a member while a criminal investigation is pending.
   ``I want to handle it consistent with what we did in the Crump
and Cantrell cases,'' Harpool said. ``It might be appropriate to
get a complaint and to educate ourselves on the issues surrounding
the allegations.''
   The Ethics Committee opted to defer disciplinary action against
Crump and Cantrell until their trials were over.

   Thousands of tiny wasps were unleashed on a
Texas field this week as growers look for new ways to control a
pesticide-resistant caterpillar that leaves cabbage heads ``so full
of holes they look like lace.''
   Four species of wasps, some smaller than the head of a pin, were
sprinkled across a commercial field of cabbage in the Rio Grande
Valley on Thursday.
   If successful against the caterpillars, growers may see the
benefits of using the wasps on other crops such as broccoli,
cauliflower and kale, said Don Nordlund, a research entomologist at
the USDA's Agricultural Research Service in Weslaco, Texas.
   Because consumers also want more pesticide-free produce, ``we
may be able to start convincing growers to switch to this approach
after this first crop,'' Nordlund said Friday.
   He said caterpillars of the diamondback moth - the cabbage
patch's worst insect enemy - are resistant to almost all available
insecticides.
   Insects have been used to control pests on the Valley's citrus
and sugar cane crops, but Nordlund said wasps have never been
tested on a commercial cabbage crop in Texas. Growers showed little
interest when wasps were tried elsewhere in the early 1970s, and
the diamondback moth has since become ren that a solution to the Persian
Gulf
crisis be linked to the problem of Israel's occupation of land
claimed by Palestinians.
   Baker said there could be no rewards for aggression, and no
partial solution to the gulf crisis. He spoke in Brussels, Belgium,
on the first leg of a 12-day foreign trip that will include talks
on the gulf crisis.

   Here are excerpts from Friday's opening
statements as senators under investigation for allegedly unethical
conduct in the savings and loan debacle denied accusations against

   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.:
   ``Charlie Keating was a political friend and supporter from 1981
to 1987. When he came to see me in March of 1987 and asked me to do
something I thought was improper, I said no. ... When he asked me
to negotiate for him, I said no. The only thing I said I could do
was to inquire whether American Continental Corp. and Lincoln
Savings were being treated fairly. ...
   ``On April 9th, I joined other senators in Senator DeConcini's
office to meet with these San Francisco regulators. ...
   ``I learned at this meeting that Lincoln's complaints of bad
treatment from the regulators were unfounded and that there would
be a criminal referral to the Justice Department against Lincoln
... I neither solicited nor accepted any campaign contributions
from Mr. Keating or American Continental employees. My relationship
with Mr. Keating was ended, over and there's nothing more.
   ``I know I acted ethically and properly and in compliance with
all applicable standards of conduct, including my own.''

   ``There are no facts as yet unrevealed. There are no surprises
in store for you. ... When these hearings are over, my conduct will
no longer be the subject of speculation, of gossip and of innuendo.
...
   ``The truth is that at no time did I pare my principles or
compromise my convictions. At no time did I ask for special
treatment for anyone. And at no time did I trade favors or perform
actions in return for money. I acted honorably, I behaved honestly
and I have neither tainted my own reputation nor tarnished the
reputation of this body. ...
   ``I believe that a crucial part of my job as a U.S. senator is
to ensure that federal regulators and bureaucrats are treating
people fairly. ...
   ``I will, and in the case of Lincoln did, ask for fair
treatment. But I will not, and in the case of Lincoln did not, ask
that a specific action be taken or that rules or regulations be
interpreted simply to benefit a particular individual or company.
...
   I have never accepted contributions from anyone who so much as
implies even indirectly that their contribution is linked to a
request for my assistance. ...
   ``In 1984, Mr. Keating apparently arranged for contributions to
help retire my presidential campaign debt, and in that same year I
sent letters to the Bank Board, asking that it delay implementation
of the so-called ``direct investment rule'' until Congress could
fully consider the issue.
   ``But when I signed those letters, neither I nor my assistant
who staffed this issue knew of Mr. Keating's contributions.''

<HEAD>Heseltine Continues Attacks on Local Tax in Campaign Against
Thatcher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who hopes to take Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's job away from her took his attack on her government's
unpopular local tax to Scotland on Friday.
   Mrs. Thatcher spent the day in Northern Ireland, where she
visited British troops in a visit her office said was planned a
month ago.
   ``I believe we shall win and I hope we shall win well,'' she
told reporters who asked about the leadership battle.
   Conservative Party members of the House of Commons will vote
Tuesday on whether to retain Mrs. Thatcher as head of the party or
to replace her with former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine. If
she loses, she also must give up the prime minister's post.
   Heseltine continued to attack the local tax imposed by her
government, saying it could cost the Conservative Party the next
general elections, which must be held by mid-1992.
   A tactical question about the leadership vote arose when Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd said he support Mrs. Thatcher but refused to
rule out the possibility that he might jump into the race if it
isn't settled on the first ballot.
   Front-page stories in The Independent and The Daily Telegraph on
Friday said that a substantial number of Conservative Party
lawmakers would prefer that Hurd take over as prime minister.
   He would have the opportunity to run only if the first round is
inconclusive.
   To win in the first round, Mrs. Thatcher or Heseltine needs 15
percent more votes than the other. If all 372 Tory lawmakers vote,
it takes 214 votes to win.
   If the second-place candidate gets at least 159 votes, there
would have to be a second ballot on Nov. 27, and other candidates
would be free to enter.
   Heseltine said in an interview with BBC Radio that it stood to
reason then that if people believe Hurd is the best candidate, the
lawmakers must vote for Heseltine to open the way for a second
round of balloting.
   Addressing a rally in the Scottish town of Lanark, Heseltine
declared that the per-capita local tax supported by Mrs. Thatcher
could lead to defeat for the Conservative Party in the next general
election.
   The so-called poll tax is set by local governments, with a
single charge for rich and poor. It replaces the property tax, and
for many households it has meant a higher tax burden.
   Heseltine's contention that he has a better chance than Mrs.
Thatcher of leading the party to victory was supported by a poll
published Friday in The Times of London.
   The poll, by Market and Opinion Research International, showed
the Conservatives trailing Labor by 4 points with Mrs. Thatcher as
leader, but vaulting 10 points ahead of Labor with Heseltine. The
survey was based on 1,088 interviews conducted on Thursday.
   Polls earlier in the week also showed that the general public
prefers Heseltine, but Conservative voters overwhelmingly support
Mrs. Thatcher.
   The only voters who will settle the leadership issue, however,
are the 372 Conservative members of the House of Commons.

   Rioters seizing their chance from a student protest
smashed shop windows, vandalized cars and battled police on Friday
after a park sit-in ended peacefully in the shadow of the Eiffel
Tower.
   Riot police hurled tear gas grenades and charged rock-throwing
hooligans, who began their rampage as 3,500 high school students
concluded their demonstration on the Champs de Mars.
   Twenty policemen were slightly injured and about 48 people were
arrested, police said.
   The troublemakers scattered into surrounding neighborhoods,
breaking three store windows, pillaging a dry-cleaning shop and
damaging 25 cars, overturning two of them, police said.
   There was nowhere near the violence that took place last Monday,
when hundreds of young toughs on the fringes of a 100,000-strong
student march looted shops, destroyed 190 cars and fought pitched
battles with police. That melee injured 234 officers.
   Leaders of the two main student movements subsequently decided
to hold a sit-in on Friday instead of a potentially more violent
march.
   Students hoisting banners with the names of their schools filed
quietly into a park. Few actually sat down on the grass, wet from
rain.
   They are demanding more teachers, smaller classes, more
innovative instruction, repairs to facilities and better security
on schoolgrounds.
   The sit-in area bordered high-priced apartment homes and
monuments.
   ``I can't say I'm very happy at the choice of place for this
demonstration, but the forces of order appear to have taken all the
right precautions,'' Mayor Jacques Chirac said before the event.
   Police closed 10 subway stations in the area and flooded the
region with thousands of helmeted officers.
   Earlier Friday, about 600 protesting students in Calais blocked
loading of freight and passengers onto two ferries bound for
Britain, delaying the ferries' departure for an hour.
   About 300 students in Montchanin in central France occupied the
train station and held up a high-speed train running from Paris to
Lyon for an hour.
   Premier Michel Rocard has freed up $1 billion in emergency funds
to improve the high schools.
   The wave of demonstrations began a month ago after a student was
raped in a school lavatory in St. Ouen, a tough working-class
suburb north of Paris.

<HEAD>Women March To Protest Economic Crisis in Bulgaria</HEAD>

   Thousands of women, many banging empty
pots with spoons, marched to government headquarters Friday to
protest growing food shortages, power blackouts and inflation.
   ``We are staying hungry in the dark,'' read one slogan they
carried during the half-mile march. Others read ``For Normal Life''
and ``Food for Our Children.''
   Parliamentary leaders meanwhile postponed a vote on a package of
economic reforms to which embattled Socialist Premier Andrei
Lukanov has tied his political future.
   The package includes steep price increases for food to help
lower the budget deficit. Lukanov told parliament Thursday he will
resign unless the measures are passed.
   But with shelves empty and food, electricity and gasoline
already rationed, many leaders worry that an austerity plan in
wintertime will heavily burden this nation of 9 million people.
   Lukanov, Finance Minister Belcho Belchev and other leaders in
the 400-seat Grand National Assembly agreed after three hours of
discussions to postpone the budget vote until next Thursday.
   Earlier, parliament passed by acclamation a separate measure
allowing ethnic Turks, forcibly renamed under Communist rule, to
restore their original names, the state news agency BTA reported.
   Under Communist President Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's 1.5 million
ethnic Turks could not use their language or openly practice their
Moslem faith.
   Zhivkov was ousted one year ago. The Communists renamed
themselves Socialists and began pursuing economic and social
reforms.
   In June 10 elections, the Socialists won 211 parlaimentary seats
to 144 for the Union of Democratic Forces, the main opposition
alliance. But 16 Socialist deputies have defected since then.
   The budget package passed a preliminary vote Thursday with 184
for, 135 against and eight abstentions.
   But Lukanov wants broad backing for his package, so the final
vote was postponed to give the opposition time to amend the draft,
said Ginyo Ganev, deputy chief of parliament.
   The program includes sweeping privatization, state spending cuts
and price increases for 21 basic consumer products.
   The opposition favors more government spending instead of higher
food prices to raise revenue.
   Lukanov says the budget deficit will soar to $570 million if the
measures aren't passed, aggravating economic ills that include a
$11 billion foreign debt.

   The party favors were there, the cake was
decorated and the audience members could leave Friday's 90th
birthday concert for the Philadelphia Orchestra saying they had
sung at the Academy of Music.
   The audience's part of the program was the old favorite ``Happy
Birthday.'' The orchestra's part was a little more highbrow -
Beethoven's ``Symphony No. 5'' and Tchaikovsky's ``Piano Concerto
No. 1,'' plus selections from the works of Goldmark, Weber, Berlioz
and Wagner.
   The program was the very the orchestra followed in its first
concert, on Nov. 16, 1900.
   But the nostalgia was not shared by everyone who can still
remember the old days and recount such accomplishments as the world
premieres, the first electrical recording by an American symphony,
the first stereo recording by an American symphony, the first radio
broadcast in 1929 and the first television broadcast in 1948.
   ``It kills me to be a spectator,'' said Isadore Schwartz, 75,
who was a violinist with the orchestra from 1945 until his
retirement in 1985.
   ``My fingers itch. They want to play. I love my music and I love
the orchestra more than anything. I just can't sit out there while
they play without me, not even now,'' said Schwartz, who is also
president of the retired musicians group.
   He still had a birthday wish, even though he didn't plan to
attend the anniversary concert.
   ``I would like to wish them continued success and hope that the
people of Philadelphia give this wonderful orchestra the
recognition it deserves. People tend to take it for granted in
Philadelphia while the people in Ames, Iowa, react with ovations
when they get a chance to hear us,'' Schwartz said.
   The violinist joined the orchestra when Leopold Stokowski was
still on the podium. Stokowski, the orchestra's third music
director, raised the Philadelphia musicians to world-class status.
   He was replaced by Eugene Ormandy. Riccardo Muti followed in
1980.
   On the podium for the anniversary concert was guest conductor
Charles Dutoit, music director of the Montreal Symphony and the
Orchestre de France. He also is artistic director for the
Philadelphia Orchestra's summer series at the Mann Music Center.

   Abul Abbas, the dissident Palestinian
wanted in the West for terrorism, said Friday that U.S. interests
around the world will be attacked if war breaks out in the Persian
Gulf.
   Speaking on Algerian television, Abbas said the number of U.S.
forces in the gulf region surpasses what is needed to fulfill their
official mission.
   The American presence ``does not target the defense of Kuwait or
that of oil wells,'' he said. It targets ``the destruction of the
Iraqi potential.''
   ``If the U.S.A. starts a war in the gulf,'' it should expect
``that its interests in the region and in other parts of the world
(would) be hit,'' he said.
   Abbas, who heads a Palestinian group based in Iraq, is wanted by
the United States for the October 1985 attack on the Achille Lauro
oceanliner in which a wheelchair-bound passenger, Leon Klinghoffer
of New York, was killed.
   About 330,000 allied soldiers, including 230,000 Americans, are
in Saudi Arabia and the region to counter Iraq. U.S. officials are
now sending 200,000 more troops there, saying they want to maintain
an offensive capability.

   A Pacific cold front moved across the central United States on
Friday, bringing clouds and slightly cooler weather to areas that
had basked in unseasonably warmth in recent days.
   Blustery northwest winds behind the front prevailed from the
southern high Plains states to the upper Great Lakes region and
temperatures dropped into the 40s. Gale warnings were in effect for
Lake Huron and Lake Erie.
   But southerly winds ahead of the front pushed temperatures
elsewhere up into the 60s and 70s. Readings in the lower 80s were
reported along the Gulf Coast at midday and in the 60s over much of
the Northeast.
   Overnight and Friday morning lows remained above freezing across
most of the nation east of the Rocky Mountains, with subfreezing
temperatures confined mainly to the northern Plains.
   Blizzard warnings were in effect in northern Alaska, where a
huge storm moved north across the Bering Sea. Storm winds were
clocked at 113 mph at west end of the Aleutian Island chain late
Thursday.
   Wind chill readings as cold as 60 degrees below zero were
expected north of the Bering Strait over the weekend.
   Rain was scattered from eastern Oklahoma to lower Michigan.
Pellston, Mich., received nearly one-third of an inch of rain
during a six-hour period ending at 1 p.m. EST, with totals
elsewhere of generally less than one-tenth of an inch.
   On Friday, record high temperatures for the date included 73 in
Baltimore, 69 in Concord, N.H., and 71 in Hartford, Conn.,
Providence, R.I., and Syracuse, N.Y.
   The nation's low Friday morning was 11 degrees at both Bozeman
and Butte, Mont.

   Washington is consulting with its
allies on whether to seek a U.N. resolution authorizing the use of
force to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, U.S. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III said Friday.
   On Friday, Baker met with top officials of the European
Community. He is to fly to Geneva on Saturday to gather support for
such a resolution from the foreign ministers of Ethiopia, Zaire and
the Ivory Coast.
   Backing from those countries would give the United States
broader approval among neutral and Third World countries.
   Baker was later to travel to Paris for talks with the foreign
ministers of Finland and Romania during a three-day Paris gathering
of the 34-nation Conference on Security and European Cooperation,
which begins Monday.
   All five countries are members of the 15-nation U.N. Security
Council, which would have to approve any resolution on the use of
force against Iraq.
   At the United Nations, diplomats said Baker was trying to
persuade Security Council foreign ministers to come to New York to
adopt a resolution authorizing force to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
Foreign ministers occupy their country's seats on the council only
in grave situations.
   Baker told reporters Friday that American officials have made no
final decision to seek any resolution on using military might
against Iraq.
   ``We are in the continuing process of consulting with our
coalition partners about whether or not that might be something we
should do,'' he said.
   Even so, the United States appears prepared to introduce the
resolution this month, while its diplomat presides over the
council. Yemen, a pro-Iraqi member of the 15-nation council, holds
the presidency for December.
   Baker said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein should understand that
force was a credible option if he does not withdraw from Kuwait,
which his forces invaded Aug. 2.
   ``Unless that message gets through to Baghdad, we really are
pessimistic about whether or not the political and peaceful
solution that we desire ... can really be obtained,'' he said.
   Baker brushed aside a suggestion Thursday from Soviet envoy
Yevgeny Primakov that a ``flexible linkage'' be drawn between an
Iraqi pullout and a conference to settle the Israeli-Palestinian
dispute.
   Saddam has demanded an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait be tied to a
solution for the Palestinian question. President Bush has said Iraq
must unconditionally withdraw but that other issues could be
discussed after Kuwait is freed.
   Baker said the United States shares a common position on Iraq
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his foreign
minister, Eduard Shevardnadze.
   They have agreed, he said, that there should be no rewards for
aggression and no partial solutions to the problem and that ``we
should not link this gulf issue with other issues.''
   He suggested Primakov may have been speaking for himself and not
for the Soviet government.
   France, China and the Soviet Union have indicated they would
like more time to give economic sanctions and diplomacy a chance to
work before adopting any resolution authorizing force against Iraq.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Chain Loses Round in Labor Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beverly Enterprises Inc., the nation's largest
nursing home chain, has been found guilty of unfair labor practices
in a ruling organized labor hailed Friday as a major victory that
could affect other corporate giants.
   The Fort Smith, Ark.,-based chain said the ruling, handed down
by an administrative law judge, would be appealed to the National
Labor Relations Board.
   At issue was a 1987 NLRB case in which the government accused
the company of engaging in 40 illegal acts ``designed to defeat''
workers' rights to organize a union.
   ``On face value, we don't agree with the decision ... We have
good relationships with all of our unions,'' said Bill Ihle, a
Beverly spokesman.
   In the ruling made public Friday, administrative law judge
Martin Linsky found Beverly guilty of unfair labor practices at 33
facilities in 12 states and ordered the chain to reinstate and
provide back pay to workers who had been illegally fired for union
activity.
   Linsky also issued a ``cease and desist'' order that requires
all of Beverly's 860 nursing homes to post for 60 days notices of
the company's labor law violations and its workers' rights to
unionize.
   ``This decision is a great victory for the tens of thousands of
workers at Beverly nursing homes, many of whom lost jobs, endured
years of harassment ... and were denied their right to union
representation,'' said John Sweeney, president of the Service
Employees International Union.
   The union said other American businesses could be affected, too,
because now the NLRB might be able to hold a single corporation
responsible for labor aw violations at its separate facilities.
   The ruling could ``trigger critical new protections for workers
of the future,'' said Sweeney, whose union represents more than
3,000 workers at 50 Beverly nursing homes.
   In the NLRB's original 1987 case, officials alleged that Beverly
had fired more than 25 union supporters and threatened to close
nursing homes if employees unionized. The government said other
violations included physical assaults by Beverly managers on union
supporters and organizers and promises of benefits to discourage
unionization.
   The original complaint was filed in Pittsburgh and consolidated
dozens of separate charges raised by four unions since August 1986
at 20 Beverly-owned facilities in Pennsylvania, Michigan,
Minnesota, Texas and Washington state.
   Specific charges included that Beverly fired 17 workers at its
Fayette Health Care Center in Uniontown, Pa., in 1986 for wearing
union buttons. The fired workers were reinstated three months later
after the NLRB threatened to get a court injunction against the
company.
   At the time, Beverly was based in Pasadena, Calif.
   In his ruling, Linsky said, ``the simple fact is that Beverly's
unfair labor practices were egregious, took place over several
years at numerous locations and clearly manifest a proclivity'' to
violate federal labor law.
   Linsky found that Beverly engaged in several illegal activities,
including unlawful threats, interrogations, promises or grants of
benefits and surveillance.

   Iran and the Soviet Union have begun a
$500 million project to build two dams on the Aras River, along the
border between the countries, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Friday.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said work on the two dams was
inaugurated Thursday by Iran's Minister of Energy, Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh, and Hasan Hasanov, prime minister of the Soviet republic
of Azerbaijan.
   The dams will beging operating within six years and will cost
$538 million, IRNA quoted Zanganeh as saying. They will generate
about 280 megawatts of electricity and will irrigate about 250,000
acres on both sides of the border, he said.
   The projects are part of an agreement for $6 billion in
industrial and defense spending signed by Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani on a visit to Moscow in June 1989.

<TEXT>
   Angola's leftist government and the
U.S.-backed rebels it is fighting resumed peace talks Friday aimed
at ending one of the last regional wars between superpower allies.
   For the fifth time this year, delegates met under Portuguese
government mediation to seek a cease-fire that would lead to
multiparty elections in the southwest African nation.
   Officials said no cease-fire was likely to be signed during the
sessions, held at a school near the coastal resort of Estoril, 16
miles west of the Portuguese capital. But Gen. Adolosi Alicerces
Mango, a rebel negotiator, said groundwork could be laid for a
truce agreement by the end of the year.
   The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA, and
the National Union of the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, were
among three rival guerrilla groups who fought Portugal until
Angola's 1975 independence.
   With the departure of the Portuguese, the MPLA emerged the
strongest group and took power. Since then UNITA, with U.S. and
South African support, has been fighting the MPLA in a war has left
an estimated 340,000 dead.
   Steps toward peace began last year when Cuba began a phased
withdrawal of its 50,000 troops that backed the Marxist government.
That was part of an agreement under which South Africa granted
independence to neighboring Namibia.
   Both Soviet and U.S. delegates were attending Friday's
negotiations. The United States has given millions in aid to UNITA;
Angola's military is armed by the Soviets.
   The head of the Soviet delegation, Foreign Ministry official
Alexander Smirnov, proposed a halt to U.S. and Soviet arms supplies
to the Angolan foes to speed the peace process, Portuguese news
reports said.
   Congress recently approved a bill to continue aid to the rebels,
but said the aid could be suspended if the Angolan government met
conditions that included a halt to Soviet arms purchases.
   In previous meetings the rebels and government reached broad
agreement on issues including international verification of a
cease-fire, human rights protection, and the eventual
implementation of a multiparty political system.
   But deep differences remain over the timetable for political
change. The rebels want elections by December 1991.
   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has said more time will be
need to prepare them.
   The rebels have insisted the Angolan government recognize their
movement before they agree to cease fire. The government wants the
rebels to stop fighting before it will grant them political
legitimacy.
   Portuguese mediators have said cease-fire documents could be
signed simultaneously with an accord granting UNITA political
legitimacy.

   The Bush administration is studying the
possibility of reducing government benefits paid to affluent
Americans in a variety of programs but not Social Security, White
House budget director Richard Darman said Friday.
   Darman said that as part of the preparation of Bush's new
budget, the administration was taking a look at benefits paid to
people at several income levels.
   He said that in the 1980s there had been significant cuts in
welfare programs for the poor. But he said those cuts left
untouched the big government programs which distribute benefits not
on the basis of income but based on other requirements spelled out
in law.
   ``We might present recommendations for trying to change that
distribution of benefits,'' Darman said.
   He specifically mentioned subsidy payments to farmers and the
giant Medicare program which provides health care for the elderly.
   But Darman said that news stories quoting unnamed sources as
saying that Social Security benefits might be trimmed were in
error.
   Darman said that report ``was mistaken in suggesting that we
were thinking of tinkering with Social Security. We are not doing
that as part of this review, but everything else is certainly in
the equation.''
   Darman made his remarks during an appearance before the Council
for Excellence in Government.
   On another topic, Darman predicted that the budget deficit for
the current fiscal year will climb to an all-time high despite the
five-year deficit-cutting agreement passed by Congress last month.
   Darman said the red ink would most likely fall in a range
between $250 billion and $300 billion.
   The deficit for the 1990 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30,
was $220.4 billion, just short of the all-time high of $221.1
billion set in 1986.
   Darman said that a variety of factors including the weakening
economy and the uncertain situation in the Middle East were
combining to make the deficit rise.
   The economy's weakness was brought home to the White House this
week in a series of meetings President Bush held with his own
advisers and a group of 20 top executives brought in to brief the
president on economic conditions.
   Darman, who attended the sessions, said that the general
consensus among both the president's advisers and the outside
experts was that the country was in a downturn, a word Bush himself
used in an interview Thursday night on CNN.
   In that interview, Bush acknowledged for the first time the
possibility of a recession but he insisted that any slump was
likely to be mild and short.
   ``Most seem to feel that if we have a recession, it will not be
deep and that we'll come out of it relatively soon, six months at
most, and I would like to think that is true,'' the president said.
   Amoco Corp. Chairman DickMarrow told reporters after Friday's
session with the president, ``There is a general feeling that we
are either in a recession or very close.''
   Darman said the purpose of the four meetings Bush has held on
the economy in the past week was to develop a strategy for
cushioning the shock of any downturn.
   He said the president will probably make recommendations for
stimulating economic growth in his budget, due to be submitted to
Congress in February. Darman said that decisions on what types of
programs to include would be made by Bush ``at the earliest'' in
late December.

   President Bush on Friday signed into law
measures to upgrade airport security and to encourage volunteerism
and community service.
   Bush signed the bills as he hurried to finish domestic business
before an eight-day foreign trip.
   The Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990 directs the
government to develop guidelines to warn passengers of terrorist
threats.
   It implements safety recommendations of the Commission on
Aviation Security and Terrorism appointed by Bush after the bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   The bill sets regulations on airport use of metal detection
devices. It requires airlines, airports and travel agents to relay
any security threat immediately to government officials.
   Airline and airport employees with access to security areas will
have to undergo background checks and new training.
   In signing the bill, Bush said he had reservations about a
provision requiring the State Department to negotiate agreements
with other nations to achieve the enhanced security measures at
foreign airports.
   Bush said he believed that provision intruded on his
presidential authority to conduct foreign policy and said he would
direct officials to interpret it so as not to conflict with that
authority.
   The National Community Service Act of 1990 provides $287 million
for community service programs, including $5 million to begin a
Thousand Points of Light Foundation to encourage volunteerism,
taking its name from Bush's phrase for volunteers.
   It provides money for programs encouraging youth community
service through schools or community organizations; grants to state
education agencies; expansion of youth corps teams for such
projects as environmental cleanup and helping the poor; and a test
program for a civilian national service corps that would provide
$5,000 in education assistance in return for a year's full-time
service at a subsistence wage.
   Bush signed the measure despite attacks by Republicans that it
included wasteful spending at a time when the government was
raising taxes, and budget constraints prevented full funding
existing programs for children and the poor.
   Bush also on Friday signed the Excellence in Mathematics,
Science and Engineering Education Act to establish a variety of
fellowships, training programs and grants to foster and improve
education in those fields. The bill authorizes $150 million for
such programs in 1991.
   The president vetoed the Indian Preference Act of 1990, which
would have established a program to direct contracts and grants to
Indian enterprises. Bush said the bill ``would impose new,
expensive, and often duplicative program responsibilities'' on the
Interior Department, which administers Indian reservations.
   Bush said in a statement that he supports the bill's goals and
is ``committed to helping alleviate the widespread unemployment and
underemployment on Indian reservations.''
   He said the bill's issues ``deserve a full airing in both Houses
of Congress.
   He said he would direct Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan to take
steps to address problems with contracting programs involving
Indian enterprises.
   Bush took the action before departing Friday night for Prague,
the first stop of an eight-day trip that will also take him to
Paris, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

<HEAD>Japanese City Eliminating `Little Black Sambo' to Improve Image</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of a Japanese city bidding for the 1998
Winter Olympics said Friday they have asked schools and libraries
to get rid of the Little Black Sambo character, which has been
attacked as racist.
   ``It is important for a better international reputation for
Nagano,'' said a municipal official in speaking about the move.
   The municipal office in Nagano, central Japan, late last month
requested that the city's schools and libraries destroy all books,
pictures and educational tools involving Little Black Sambo.
   Sambo, originally meaning a person who was half Indian and half
black, has been used as a degrading name for blacks for decades.
   Nagano city maintains everything that carries the word ``Sambo''
or pictures of the boy should be banned, regardless of content. But
Nagano's library officials said references describing racial
problems in the story should not be banned.
   Also Friday, the Justice Ministry said it will use a photograph
of children of different races on a publicity poster in an effort
to combat racism.
   A ministry official said it will be the first poster featuring
American blacks in the government's promotional publication to
counter racial discrimination.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
posters are expected to be put up at train stations and public
facilities next month.
   Anti-discrimination campaigns have been held periodically since
the Justice Ministry's office of human rights was established about
40 years ago, he said.
   It is not clear whether the poster for this year's campaign is
related to controversial remarks made in September by Justice
Minister Seiroku Kajiyama, who compared prostitutes to American
blacks.
   Following a police roundup of foreign prostitutes in Tokyo's red
light district, Kajiyama said such prostitutes ``rui the
atmosphere'' of neighborhoods they move into.
   ``It's like in America when neighborhoods become mixed because
blacks move in and whites are forced out,'' Kajiyama said.
   His remarks, which provoked protests in the United States and
Japan, were only the latest in a series of controversial comments
on race from high-ranking Japanese politicians and government
officials.
   Sambo-like figures, with exaggerated lips and other
stereotypical features, can still be seen in some toys and other
items. In 1988, Japan drew harsh criticism from the United States
for black mannequins and dolls displayed and sold at stores.
   In August this year, a citizens group forced a major publishing
house to strike out expressions and drawings exaggerating physical
features of blacks in five popular comic books.
   Iwanami Shoten, the first Japanese publisher to introduce the
Little Black Sambo story in Japan, said in late 1988 that the
comics would not be reprinted.

<TEXT>
   Arab and non-aligned speakers on Friday
urged the U.N. Security Council to deploy U.N. peacekeepers in the
Israeli-occupied territories to protect Palestinians, a measure the
United States rejects.
   A U.S. diplomat described the PLO-backed initiative as ``veto
bait'' and said the United States would block it.
   Other Western diplomats said, however, that a compromise
resolution was possible because all 15 council members want to
avoid a veto or divisive vote.
   Colombia, Libya, Malaysia, Syria and Tunisia all spoke Friday in
support of redeploying U.N. military observers stationed in
Jerusalem for the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization to monitor
the treatment of Palestinians.
   The proposed resolution also calls for convening a meeting of
the 164 signatories of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which governs
the treatment of occupied peoples, and an international conference
on Middle East peace.
   It is sponsored by Yemen, Malaysia, Colombia and Cuba.
   Israel rejects any U.N. intervention to protect Palestinians as
a violation of its sovereignty over the territory it seized in the
1967 Mideast war. It also objects to convening signatories of the
1949 Geneva convention, arguing it doesn't apply to the Palestinian
territories.
   The PLO's acting observer, M. Nasser Al-Kidwa, told reporters
Friday that the PLO opposes watering down the resolution to drop
the call for U.N. observers, saying they were ``an essential
factor.''
   ``We need to produce a new mechanism to monitor the situation
and report back to the Security Council,'' Al-Kidwa said. He said
he hoped the proposed resolution would be brought to a vote on
Monday.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, meanwhile, was
considering whether to send Jean-Claude Aime, his special envoy, to
Israel and the occupied territories to study the situation there,
aides said. They said Perez de Cuellar would not make a decision
until he returns from Paris on Tuesday.
   Israel rejected a Security Council call for an investigation
into the Oct. 8 violence on the Temple Mount in which 17
Palestinians were killed. It announced this week, however, that it
would accept a visit by Aime to investigate general Arab-Israeli
violence as long as it excluded the Temple Mount.

   Cable News Network asserted again Friday the FBI
wrongfully took a reporter's box of materials on the Manuel Noriega
case, but the network could not fully explain just how it ended up
in the FBI's hands.
   The FBI said it would not analyze the box's contents until
officials answer CNN's complaint.
   At a packed news conference at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, CNN
general counsel Steven Korn said the network has not seen a
subpoena or search warrant for the box, which was taken by FBI
agents Thursday after security officers removed it from the hotel
room of reporter Marlene Fernandez earlier this week.
   The hotel is housed in CNN's headquarters complex, and Korn
acknowledged that Turner Security, a CNN sister company, was aware
of the box's whereabouts before FBI agents removed it.
   Asked why Turner Security didn't call CNN about the box, Korn
said, ``That's a good question.''
   But Korn denied that CNN arranged the box's removal as a ruse.
   ``I am confident the general public will not be misled to think
that this is a ruse, because I know you are all good reporters and
you will accurately report that this is no such thing whatsoever,''
he said.
   There was no word Friday on whether the box's contents had
anything to do with CNN's legal battle over its attempt to air
audio tapes of government wiretaps of Noriega.
   Korn said he did not know whether the box's contents could
identify CNN's sources on the Noriega story, but said ``we don't
believe our ability to pursue this story has been compromised.''
   CNN President Tom Johnson said Friday he didn't know if the
recordings contained in the box were audio or video tapes, or if
they were the phone calls between Noriega and his legal team.
   ``We just know that there were notes, work papers and tapes''
related to CNN's coverage of the Noriega story, Johnson said.
   William Hinshaw, head of the FBI's Atlanta bureau, said Friday
his agency agreed to seal the box. He said he would not examine its
contents further until ordered to do so.
   Hinshaw said he saw some cassettes in the box but didn't know if
they were Noriega tapes.
   CNN would not tell reporters how to reach Ms. Fernandez, and an
FBI agent also came up empty when he showed up at CNN's Washington
bureau looking for her.
   Meanwhile, he said, CNN has protested the box's removal ``at the
highest level of the FBI'' and demanded its return. Korn maintained
that while he has not seen the contents of the box, it was the
``lawful property'' of CNN and Ms. Fernandez.
   ``The property was not the property of the hotel. It was not the
property of the FBI. It had not been abandoned,'' Korn said.
   Korn would not answer reporters' questions on how long the box
was in Ms. Fernandez' room, why it was there and not in the CNN
newsroom a short walk away, and why the box apparently was picked
up as abandoned property by security officers even though Ms.
Fernandez had not checked out of her room.
   CNN has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a federal
judge's order, issued last week, barring it from airing recordings
of conversations between Noriega and the fallen Panamanian
dictator's legal team.
   CNN's reports disclosing the existence of the the government
tapes prompted his lawyers to ask a judge to throw out the drug
charges against him.
   Korn said he had not received a response from Joseph Whitley,
the U.S. attorney in Atlanta, to a letter CNN sent ``demanding the
return of the tapes and that the materials in the box not be
reviewed or duplicated.''
   Whitley was out of town Friday. Messages left for his assistant,
Ray Rukstele, were not immediately returned.
   Korn said it wasn't clear yet how the FBI was notified about the
box. ``I don't know who called who. There was a discussion between
the FBI and Turner Security. It's unclear to me who initiated the
call.''
   ``The FBI did not initiate any call on that whatsoever. The call
on that was initiated by Turner Security,'' said Dick Hildreth,
assistant special agent in charge of the Atlanta FBI office.
``Until they called us, we didn't know any such box existed.''

<HEAD>Congressman Says Political Pressure Stopped French Pill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators, caving in to political
pressure, interrupted important non-abortion research when they
barred Americans from importing personal supplies of the French
abortion drug RU-486, the chairman of a congressional subcommittee
said Friday.
   The Food and Drug Administration's action in June 1989 helped
fuel the anti-abortion fever that has led the drug's maker to
curtail supplies of RU-486 allowed in this country, said Rep. Ron
Wyden, D-Ore.
   The result has been that at least some of the research groups
with FDA permission to test RU-486 as a treatment for breast
cancer, Cushing's syndrome and other diseases have been stopped, he
said.
   Cushing's syndrome is a disorder of the pituitary gland that can
produce obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, psychiatric problems and
other symptoms.
   ``Here's this drug that's very controversial with multiple
benefits, and the only regulatory pronoucement about it was clearly
based on politics rather than science,'' Wyden said.
   The congressman noted that the FDA imposed the personal import
ban one month after receiving a letter from 11 members of the House
and Senate who oppose abortion. In their letter, the lawmakers told
the FDA, ``The U.S. government should not be involved in abetting
abortion.''
   Groups that oppose abortion have threatened to boycott and take
other actions against companies or organizations that try to bring
RU-486 to the United States for abortion.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit denied that the agency was motivated
by politics or acted under pressure from Congress.
   The criteria for allowing unapproved drugs to be imported for
personal use are straightforward, and RU-486 did not meet three of
them, he said.
   The three criteria that RU-486 failed are that a personally
imported drug must be aimed at a serious or life-threatening
illness, there has to be no existing standard therapy for the
illness and there have to be no safety questions.
   The safety problem, in FDA's mind, was the possibility that
women could take the drug unsupervised by a physician.
   In France, RU-486 is approved to induce abortion in early-stage
pregnancies. It is used, under supervision of a physician, along
with prostaglandin, a drug that speeds shedding of the uterus
lining.
   Wyden's Small Business Subcommittee on Regulation, Business
Opportunities and Energy plans to hold a hearing Monday at which
several people are to testify about their research with RU-486.
   Researchers at the National Institutes of Health are conducting
at least two of the clinical trials that have been approved by the
FDA, and as the law requires, none uses RU-486 for abortion.
   Dr. George Chrousos, a researcher at the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development, said he has ``some
apprehension'' about getting assurances from the drug's
manufacturer, Roussel-Uclaf, for further supply of the drug for the
next phase of his study on Cushing's syndrome.
   ``They are apprehensive,'' he said of company officials.
   Kathryn B. Horwitz, a researcher at the University of Colorado
School of Medicine in Denver, said her federally financed research
with RU 486 in the treatment of breast cancer is threatened by the
FDA's import ban.
   ``The politics of abortion is restricting use of a drug that has
much potential beyond abortion, for treatment of cancer, hormonal
disorders and all kinds of things,'' she said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has navigated through five
years of political upheaval by staking out the middle between angry
opponents, but the formula ran aground Friday when lawmakers
demanded he pick a side.
   The Supreme Soviet called Gorbachev to account for the
foundering economy and fragmenting union, hoping to hear their
president had settled on a path of rapprochement during a four-hour
meeting Sunday with his popular rival, Russian republic leader
Boris Yeltsin.
   Yeltsin's vast republic controls the bulk of the country's
resources, while the Kremlin holds financial and military
authority. The leaders' conflicting orders for economic reform have
paralyzed the country, and their meeting raised hopes for a
power-sharing compromise that could rescue the economy.
   But what deputies heard Friday from Gorbachev were more calls
for consolidation around his five-year-ol perestroika program and
his embattled proposal for a new treaty to hold the 15 republics
together. Gorbachev gave short shrift to his private meeting with
Yeltsin, calling it a ``routine'' session that was being
sensationalized by politicians and the media.
   Instead, he called for a replacement of the military and
government officials whom he said were blocking his reforms.
   He tried once again to pit his opponents against each other,
suggesting the smaller republics, whose national cultures were
suppressed during much of the Communist Party's 73-year rule,
should be wary of a leading role by ethnic Russians.
   ``In a coalition government, if the Russian government gets any
more power, it will mean discrimination against the other
republics,'' he said.
   A year ago, the warning might have struck a chord with many
republic leaders, who are all too familiar with the history of
imperial Russia's domination over a country stretching from the
Chinese border to Poland.
   But on Friday, the only lawmakers to respond enthusiastically
were from small ethnic groups who themselves complain of
discrimination within the republics. Republic leaders attending the
session said they would support the proposed treaty only if the
Kremlin recognized their independence first and gave clear
guarantees the pact would be voluntary.
   Most of the deputies in the hall were clearly fed up with
Gorbachev's pronouncements. The chamber's closed circuit cameras
panned the hall to show uninspired faces and heads leaning on
hands.
   Gorbachev didn't even receive the traditional applause at the
end of his speech, as deputies began rising to press him with
questions. He left the hall without giving any answers.
   Outside the chamber, both reformists and hard-liners attacked
the president. Leningrad's radical mayor, Anatoly Sobchak, told
reporters that Gorbachev's speech ``was not what we needed.''
Conservative former Politburo member Yegor Ligachev complained
Gorbachev said ``nothing about how to attract the political forces
needed to solve the problems.''
   Yeltsin, who had sat nearly expressionless during Gorbachev's
speech, took the floor and demanded Gorbachev agree within two
weeks to set up an ``extraordinary anti-crisis committee'' that
would replace the government of embattled Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryhkov.
   The fact that Yeltsin, who is not a member of the parliament,
could stage such public defiance of Gorbachev reflected his surging
popularity. An opinion poll released Friday by the National Public
Opinion Center said 75 percent of respondents thought Yeltsin could
best represent Russia's interests, compared with 35 percent for
Gorbachev. The poll didn't give a margin of error.
   Another indication of Gorbachev's plummeting support came from a
deputy general secretary of the Communist Party, Vladimir Ivashko,
who said he has received ``a staggering number of letters'' from
party members demanding that Gorbachev quit as party leader and
concentrate on his presidential duties.
   Gorbachev ousted Yeltsin from the party's Politburo two years
ago, but Yeltsin made a political comeback and was elected
president of Russia last summer.
   Last Sunday's meeting raised hopes of a new compromise, but when
Gorbachev delivered his negative answer Friday, he retreated to a
narrow middle ground, which may be a hard place to stand.

   Atlantis' five astronauts, orbiting
Earth in a public silence imposed by the Pentagon, deployed a spy
satellite aimed at Iraq and will return to Earth on Monday, NASA
and military sources said Friday.
   The astronauts spent their first full day in space Friday
working under a shroud of secrecy. However, sources speaking on
condition of anonymity said the satellite was placed in orbit.
   NASA punctuated the silence Friday evening to report that
Atlantis would land at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., sometime
between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. EST Monday. A more precise time will be
announced 24 hours before landing.
   ``The crew is doing well, and the orbiter Atlantis continues to
perform satisfactorily,'' said Mission Control's Kari Fluegel.
   Atlantis thundered into orbit Thursday night carrying a
satellite that purportedly is to spy on Iraq. The shuttle was
visible along the entire Florida coast and as far north as South
Carolina as it rode a 700-foot column of flame through the
darkness.
   It was the fifth time NASA launched a shuttle at nighttime and
the seventh and last time a shuttle will carry a classified
military cargo into space.
   Atlantis' crew, commanded by Air Force Col. Richard Covey, had
been expected to release the spy satellite from the shuttle's cargo
bay within 24 hours of liftoff. Experts believe the spacecraft will
focus cameras or electronic signal detectors on the Persian Gulf.
   The Pentagon plans to use the shuttle two more times, both in
1991 to carry unclassified cargoes. Future military satellites will
be lifted into orbit by unmanned rockets, principally the Titan 4.
   Atlantis' flawless liftoff - the second shuttle flight in two
months - was greeted enthusiastically by NASA officials, who spent
much of the year contending with grounded shuttles.
   Hydrogen leaks crippled Columbia, then Atlantis over the summer.
Both shuttles were cleared for flight last month following
extensive repairs.
   Atlantis last flew in March, when it carried another spy
satellite into orbit.
   ``It puts Atlantis back into flying status again,'' said launch
director Bob Sieck. ``In a few weeks, we expect to have Columbia
there, too. So we'll have all three shuttles flying again.''
   Columbia's astronomy mission has been on hold since May, when
the shuttle's hydrogen leaks were discovered. Four countdowns were
attempted before NASA stopped to make way for Discovery's October
flight with a satellite on a mission to study the sun.
   If Columbia goes up in early December as planned, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration will have achieved six shuttle
flights for 1990. Nine missions originally were planned.

<HEAD>France Reinforces Troops in Eastern Chad Amid Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France announced Friday it has moved 150 soldiers
to reinforce its standing detachment in eastern Chad, where that
nation's government has been battling rebels who attacked last
weekend.
   The announcement came on the same day as reports that Chad is
mobilizing its population to fight the insurgents. There were also
reports - denied by Chad - that the North African country had asked
Zaire to send troops.
   In its statement, the French Defense Ministry said the company
of soldiers normally based in the Chadian capital, N'Djamena, took
up positions this week near Abeche. The French garrison there is
about 100 miles from the zone of recent fighting near the Sudanese
border.
   The reinforcements bring the French garrison in Abeche to 500
men. France bases about 1,000 soldiers in the former colony to
support the government of President Hissene Habre. Chad has about
5.5 million residents.
   The ministry communique said the reinforcements were made to
increase the security of the Abeche garrison. It did not say if any
French forces had come under attack.
   Military sources say rebels of the Islamic Legion have taken
control of several border outposts since attacking from western
Sudan last weekend. The rebels are led by Idriss Deby, a former
chief of the Chadian armed forces.
   Habre accuses Libya and Sudan of suppporting the rebels with
weapons, training and bases. Both those countries deny the charges.
   The Chadian Embassy in Paris denied the reports Thursday from
Kinshasa, Zaire, that Chadian officials had asked President Mobutu
Sese Seko to send troops.
   ``Certainly, violent combat is under way in the region of Tine,
but the Chadian National Armed Forces are mastering the
situation,'' Ambassador Allam-Mi Ahmad said.
   Chadian national radio reported that the government is
mobilizing the population against what it called ``hordes of
mercenaries coming from Libya and Sudan.'' It did not elaborate on
the measures. The country has about 5.4 million people.
   About 2,000 rebels equipped with Soviet and Brazilian-made
armored vehicles were reported to have attacked Tine over the
weekend.
   The government said loyal troops repulsed the incursion after 24
hours of fighting but reported a new attack Monday. There has been
no mention of casualties from either side.
   Chad and Libya have long been at odds. Chad chased Libyan
soldiers from the disputed, mineral-rich Aouzou Strip along their
common border in 1987.
   It has since accused Libya of supporting rebels based in Sudan's
sparsely populated Darfur province, where the Khartoum goverment
exercises practically no control.

<TEXT>
   Fighting between Rwandan government
troops and rebels has spilled over into Uganda, injuring some
Ugandans and causing hundreds of others to flee, newspapers
reported Friday.
   Capt. Sam Bishumba, a battalion commander in southwestern
Uganda, threatened retaliation Thursday against Rwandan troops
pursuing insurgents into Ugandan territory, the newspapers said.
   Rwandan refugees launched an invasion of their homeland from
southwestern Uganda on Sept. 30.
   Bishumba told journalists on a tour of the Gatuna border area
that a Rwandan military helicopter had penetrated up to three miles
inside Uganda chasing the rebels on Wednesday. He said an unknown
number of Ugandans were injured and others fled.
   Talks to end the fighting in Rwanda were to resume Tuesday in
the eastern Zairean town of Goma, state-controlled Radio Zaire
reported Friday. The leaders of Zaire, Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania
and Rwanda were to attend the summit, to be followed by a meeting
of Rwandan authorities and rebels Wednesday.
   Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seso, who is mediating the
dispute, will chair the meeting between the warring parties,
according to the Zairean broadcast monitored in Nairobi.
   The rebels, who call themselves the Rwandese Patriotic Front,
are predominantly members of Rwanda's minority Tutsi tribe, most of
whom have lived in exile for nearly 30 years. Hundreds of thousands
of Tutsi fled the tiny central African nation in the late 1950s
when the majority Hutu overthrew the Tutsi-led government and
killed more than 10,000 members of the Tutsi tribe.
   The rebels accuse Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana's
single-party government of corruption and seek to replace it with 
democracy.
   Habyarimana has expressed his willingness to allow a multiparty
system in Rwanda. On Tuesday, he urged Rwandans to present their
suggestions of reform to a 30-member committee that has been
meeting since September to draft a new political charter.

   Blanche Taylor Moore, 57, was convicted Wednesday of killing
Raymond Reid in 1986. The jury deliberate over her sentence for
four hours.
   Judge William Freeman concurred with the death sentence, and set
a Jan. 18, 1991, execution date. The case automatically will be
appealed to the state Supreme Court.
   If her appeals fail, Mrs. Moore would be given the choice of
dying by lethal injection or in the gas chamber.
   Freeman told Mrs. Moore to stand and she had little reaction as
he handed down the death sentence.
   As the jury's recommendation was read, Mrs. Moore closed her
eyes. She appeared to sob as jurors were polled, and then turned to
calm her two daughters.
   As Mrs. Moore was led from the courtroom, brother Sam Kiser said
to her: ``We still believe in you, Blanche.'' After she was taken
to a holding cell, relatives were permitted to visit her.
   None of the members of the arsenic poisoning victims' families
were present for the sentencing.
   Defense attorneys had pleaded with jurors to spare her life.
   ``We're looking at a person here with a good side ... but with a
dark spot,'' defense attorney Mitchell McEntire said, reminding the
jury of the evidence that she was ``driven to do good works.''
   But Forsyth County District Attorney Warren Sparrow called on
the jury to condemn Mrs. Moore to death.
   ``The murder of Raymond Reid was atrocious, heinous and cruel by
any definition,'' Sparrow said.
   ``Do your duty to the state and you will find ... the
appropriate recommendation for punishment will be death,'' he said.
   Reid, of Kernersville, died in October 1986 at North Carolina
Baptist Hospital in Winston-Salem. Prosecutors said during the
four-week trial that Mrs. Moore was driven by a need for money and
that she killed Reid to gain part of his estate.
   Mrs. Moore also is charged in the death of her first husband,
James Taylor, in 1973, and the poisoning of her estranged husband,
the Rev. Dwight Moore, who became sick after their honeymoon last
year. She may be tried later on those charges.
   Investigators began looking into the deaths of Mrs. Moore's
acquaintances after doctors discovered last year the arsenic
poisoning of her husband. Officials exhumed five bodies during the
investigation and found arsenic in the body of her father. She was
not charged in his death.
   Defense attorneys tried to lay the blame for the deaths upon an
acquaintance of Mrs. Moore's, Garvin Thomas. They produced a
rambling, five-page letter in which he allegedly confessed to the
crimes. Thomas died before the letter arrived at Mrs. Moore's jail
cell.

   Senators under investigation for helping
Charles H. Keating Jr. battle federal banking regulators
emotionally defended their integrity and denied any wrongdoing
Friday before the Senate Ethics Committee.
   ``John Glenn does not peddle influence, period,'' the Ohio
Democrat told the panel of fellow senators. Sen. Donald W. Riegle
Jr., D-Mich., held up a jigsaw puzzle and said the committee
special counsel was missing some key pieces when he negatively
described Riegle's conduct.
   The committee turned to personal defense statements by the
``Keating Five'' senators after the counsel, Robert Bennett, wound
up a day and a half detailing accusations and evidence against
them.
   In addition to Riegle and Glenn, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz. and
Alan Cranston, D-Calif. presented their statements. Cranston and
Riegle showed considerable emotion in their appeals for
exoneration.
   The hearing adjourned until Monday, leaving only Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz. to make his defense statement. After he speaks,
witnesses will be called.
   Bennett concentrated on Cranston, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat,
on Friday, saying his help for Keating and the businessman's
failing Lincoln Savings and Loan was ``closely connected'' to
political donations from Keating.
   Cranston, suffering from prostate cancer and making his first
appearance at the hearings, was defiant in his denials.
   ``I engaged in no unethical conduct,'' he said firmly. ``You
know that I broke no law. ... You know that I broke no Senate rule.
... You know that I pocketed no money, that there was no personal
gain for me or any member of my family.''
   ``Yes, I was persistent in expressing my concerns about the way
bureaucrats were dealing with this large business in my state,'' he
said, referring to the savings and loan, which was chartered in
California. ``I believed that its failure, if it came to that ...
would be a catastrophe for countless constituents of mine.''
   The Ethics Committee of three Democrats and three Republicans
will make recommendations based on the hearings that could
determine the political futures of the five, except Cranston, who
has said he will not seek re-election.
   The committee is trying to determine whether the $1.3 million
Keating and associates donated to the five influenced their
intervention on his behalf with banking regulators.
   Many of the donations were given to the senators' campaigns and
causes while Keating was trying to save his Irvine, Calif.,
institution. Regulators seized the thrift in April 1989 and it
could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion to cover the losses.
   Cranston and Riegle enlivened their presentation with props in
the televised hearings.
   The California senator placed five huge posters on easels
listing designated staff fund-raisers for each of the Senate's 100
members.
   ``It is absurd to suggest that fund-raising and substantive
issues are separated in Senate offices by some kind of wall,'' the
senator said.
   Riegle held up the puzzle because Bennett had done so on
Thursday in promising to fit them all together.
   Bennett, Riegle said, did not ``have all the pieces of the
puzzle. We just have some of the pieces.''
   For instance, Riegle said Bennett's presentation left out the
main purpose of a Riegle-Keating meeting in January 1987. Bennett
said it was related to a Keating-hosted fund-raiser for Riegle
scheduled the following March.
   But Riegle said Keating's itinerary made clear the main reason
for the meeting was to discuss a $54 million Keating development
project in Detroit.
   ``Sometimes documents can bleed when they're not presented
fairly,'' Riegle said. ``That one was not presented fairly.''
   At the end of Riegle's presentation his voice broke as he
thanked his family for support.
   First up to defend himself Friday was McCain of Arizona, the
only Republican in the group. He declared, ``I know I acted
ethically and properly.''
   Next came Glenn, who said, ``At no time did I trade favors or
perform actions in return for money.''
   Bennett has recommended that the committee dismiss McCain and
Glenn from the case but that the investigation be intensified for
Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle.
   Friday's second day of the hearings got off to an acrimonious
start as Cranston's lawyer asked that one member, Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., be barred from judging the California Democrat.
   Helms, speaking under oath, stoutly denied Cranston attorney
William W. Taylor III's accusation that he had already made up his
mind in the case. Helms refused to step aside.
   Taylor had cited reports from Helms' recent, successful
re-election campaign in which the North Carolina Republican had
referred to Cranston as ``the leading water carrier'' for Keating.
   McCain said Keating was a ``political friend and supporter''
from 1981 through 1987, when the two had a falling out because
McCain refused to negotiate with banking regulators on the
businessman's behalf.
   ``When he came to see me in 1987 and asked me to do something I
thought was improper, I said no,'' McCain said. ``When he asked me
to get (former top thrift regulator Edwin J. Gray off his back, I
said no.''
   Despite the argument with Keating in March 1987, McCain said he
still attended April 2 and April 9, 1987, meetings between
regulators and the senators in which the lawmakers demanded fair
treatment for Lincoln.
   The most immediate decision for the panel is to determine
whether the investigation of each senator should be intensified or
dropped.
   Bennett said as he outlined the evidence Thursday and Friday
that Crnston, DeConcini and Riegle were more involved in helping
Keating than McCain and Glenn.
   Keating donated $850,000 to three voter registration projects
supported by Cranston and $49,000 to his political campaigns.
   Bennett said that in September 1987 Cranston sought to solicit
$500,000 at one time for the voter projects. His fund-raiser, Joy
Jacobson, told the committee ``she thought that was too much'' and
persuaded him to lower his request to $250,000, Bennett said.
Keating gave the $250,000 Nov. 6.
   Bennett, in presenting his findings from a yearlong
investigation, said, ``In retrospect, I think there was a link''
between Keating's contributions and Cranston's assistance. ``Sen.
Cranston's contacts with the (Federal Home Loan Bank) board, the
evidence will show, were closely connected with fund-raising by
Keating.''
   He added, ``It wasn't Mr. Keating who was always seeking things.
Sen. Cranston sought contributions from Mr. Keating.''
   Bennett added, ``The evidence will show on four occasions
Cranston accepted or solicited several hundred thousands of dollars
from Keating for voter registration.''

<HEAD>Berlin Gov't Paralyzed; Mayor Offers to Negotiate with Radicals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Berlin's mayors offered Friday to negotiate
with radical squatters to end the riots that have paralyzed the
city's government and threatened to topple its other mayor.
   A mass police crackdown on leftist radicals occupying scores of
buildings in the city this week has resulted in violent protests,
street fights with police and hundreds of arrests and injuries.
   The Berlin government has almost collapsed, and the violence has
fueled the arguments of those who oppose making it the seat of
government of united Germany.
   Berliners will elect a united government on Dec. 2, when all
Germans also will choose a national government.
   Tino Schwierzina, the former East Berlin mayor who still holds
the title until German elections, said he would negotiate with the
leftist radicals as long as they refrained from riots.
   But the radicals, through intermediaries, issued a statement
refusing negotiations and describing the police action as
``terrorism.''
   In any case, it is not Schwierzina but West Berlin Mayor Walter
Momper who is actually running the city, and Momper is in danger of
losing his job over the squatters' controversy.
   The leftist Greens coalition bolted from Momper's coalition on
Thursday to protest what they called unnecessary police action in
evicting hundreds of squatters occupying scores of abandoned
tenements in former East Berlin. The squatters are protesting a
lack of affordable housing in Berlin.
   Momper's Social Democrats now hold a minority in the city
Senate, and the remaining parties say they will not support him as
mayor. The conservative Christian Democrats were to decide Tuesday
whether to support a no-confidence vote for Momper.
   Violent clashes since Monday have resulted in nearly 300 arrests
and 400 injuries, many serious. Traffic has been snarled by street
fighting and marches.
   On Wednesday, 3,000 riot police and paramilitary troops raided a
block of tenements that had been taken over by the radicals, and
the hours of street battles caused serious damage.
   Police used bulldozers, armored cars, water cannons and tear gas
against masked street fighters who threw rocks, debris and
firebombs.
   The rioting has bolstered the arguments of those who want the
seat of a united German government to remain in the relatively
placid town of Bonn.
   Berlin was designated the symbolic capital of Germany when the
two former nations united on Oct. 3, but the united German
parliament that is elected on Dec. 2 will have to decide whether to
move government ministries to Berlin.
   Critics say the move would be too costly given the massive costs
of salvaging eastern Germany's collapsing economy.
   They also cite the city's chronic social unrest, caused mainly
by the veteran leftist underground, for whom the clashes with
police fit into a scheme of reducing Germany to a state of anarchy.

<TEXT>
   Moldavian nationalist youths roamed the streets of
Kishinev, attacking Russian-speakers and beating up an ethnic
Russian member of parliament, Soviet news media and a witness said
Friday.
   The violence swept the Moldavian capital Thursday after the
funeral of Dumitru Moldovanu, a young man who reportedly was
stabbed in the heart three days earlier in an argument with a
Russian who insulted the republic's flag.
   Ethnic tension has gripped the republic of 4.3 million people,
bordering Romania, as it has pushed for independence from the
Soviet Union during the past year.
   Alarmed by rising Moldavian nationalism, two minority groups
have launched separatist movements.
   The Gagauz - about 150,000 Turkish Christians - declared a new
republic in southern Moldavia.
   Ethnic Russians and Ukrainians joined in declaring a new
republic along the Dniester River in eastern Moldavia. They speak
Russian rather than Romanian, Moldavia's official language.
   The ethnic conflict flared into violence Nov. 2 when Moldavia's
government sent its Interior Ministry troops to clear roadblocks
set up by militants in the Dniester area. Three people were killed
and nine were wounded by gunfire.
   On Thursday, more than 150 ethnic Moldavian youths, angry over
the stabbing of Moldavanu, broke into cafes and beat up people who
did not speak Romanian, the official Soviet news agency Tass and
the government newspaper Izvestia reported.
   A member of the non-Moldavian minority in parliament, Ilya
Trombitsky, said in a telephone interview Friday he witnessed the
beating of a colleague and narrowly avoided a similar fate.
   He said he was sitting in a popular cafe in downtown Kishinev,
drinking coffee with fellow lawmakers Andrei Safonov and Pyotr
Shornikov, when about 20 youhs pushed their way into the building.
   ``They came up to some people at another table who were speaking
Russian, and they demanded to know their nationality,'' Trombitsky
said.
   ``One young man said he was Russian. He was sitting with a girl,
but they grabbed him anyway and punched him, and he fell to the
ground and they started kicking him.
   ``We tried to help him, but there were too many of them. They
came after us, too. We headed for the door, but they blocked the
way.''
   He said he and Shornikov were allowed through, ``but they
wouldn't let Safonov out.''
   Trombitsky said they called police, but by the time help
arrived, Safonov had a black eye and was cut and bruised, and the
young man first attacked had received ``a very good beating.''
   The lawmaker said the youths stole Safonov's watch and the
girl's jewelry. He said similar attacks were reported elsewhere
downtown.
   Tass quoted First Deputy Interior Minister Konstantin Antoch as
saying Kishinev police were on alert, but ``proved ineffective and
somewhat late'' in stopping the rampage.
   No one was arrested, Antoch said.
   The parliament passed a resolution Friday condemning the
violence and calling it a provocation aimed at disrupting
Moldavia's ``national reconciliation process.''

   Manuel Noriega on Friday pleaded to keep his
defense lawyers during a hearing to consider appointing
government-paid attorneys to represent him because of delays in
unfreezing his assets.
   ``I believed mistakenly I would have a fair trial,'' the deposed
Panamanian dictator said. ``I was made to believe that I could use
my funds to hire lawyers of my own choice.''
   Citing his military background, Noriega said his attorneys were
``armed with handguns and no support staff, while the prosecutor's
office has nuclear weapons.''
   ``I realize this case has implications to the highest levels of
the United States government, including the White House, and I also
realize that many forces are at work beyond your honor's control,''
Noriega said, explaining his fears about getting a fair trial.
   Noriega's private defense attorneys made a last-minute plea to
the judge to throw out the limit on fees in the Criminal Justice
Act.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler did not immediately decide
the issue but appeared unmoved. He said he had received indications
from ``some exceedingly fine criminal defense lawyers'' who were
willing to take the case under the low government fee schedule.
   Looking at Noriega, the judge sought to assure him that he would
get a fair trial.
   ``I want the defendant to understand he is not being cast adrift
by the court and by the judicial system,'' Hoeveler said.
   Noriega's lawyers, led by Frank Rubino, told the judge they
would have to abandon the case under conditions set by a law
governing court-appointed legal counsel.
   The 20-minute plea was Noriega's first extensive statement in
court since surrendering to invading U.S. troops in January. Clad
in his four-star general's uniform, he read in Spanish, speaking
forcefully but without raising his voice.
   He had appeared subdued in some recent hearings, but on Friday
smiled and waved to an acquaintance in the audience, and talked
animatedly with one of his attorneys.
   Earlier in the day, the private defense team filed a broad
motion asking dismissal of all drug charges against their client.
   Court papers argued that freezing Noriega's assets and taping
his phone calls from prison constituted government misconduct.
   Rubino also said an unidentified government witness had sought a
bribe to change his testimony, possibly in an ttempt to entrap the
defense.
   ``It is abundantly clear that the United States has engaged in
misconduct heretofore unimaginable,'' the motion said. ``Indeed,
the quality and degree of the government's crimes is unlike
anything seen since Watergate.''
   Earlier this month, Cable News Network reported it had audio
tapes of jailhouse telephone conversations between Noriega and his
defense team. Rubino protested that such monitoring of confidential
conversations, apparently by federal authorities, and any airing of
the tapes by CNN compromised his client's right to a fair trial.
   Hoeveler did not immediately rule on the dismissal motion.
   The fee controversy springs from U.S. efforts in the wake of
December's invasion of Panama to freeze 27 Noriega-linked bank
accounts holding about $20 million. U.S. prosecutors told foreign
governments in France, Switzerland, Austria and other nations that
the money was drug-related.
   After Noriega's capture and return to the United States, his
attorneys went to Hoeveler asking to withdraw from the case because
they had no money to pay fees or expenses.
   Instead, all sides initially worked out a deal for the
government to hire Rubino and his legal team for rates as high as
$350 an hour under the Criminal Justice Act. The 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, however, said there was no statutory authority
for those rates.
   The law allows only two or three attorneys paid no more than $75
an hour during the trial and $40 for preparatory work. In addition,
the law sharply limits expenses, with judges never granting more
than a few thousand dollars for investigators and research.
   After that rejection, Hoeveler took another route. He determined
that Noriega must have had legitimate income during his tenure as a
military officer and ordered the U.S. government to free about $6
million of the frozen funds. That money was to go into an escrow
account to pay legal expenses.
   But in the following five months, the Justice Department failed
to win the release of any money. Its attorneys told Hoeveler on
Tuesday that the foreign governments had initiated their own
confiscation actions, and balked at releasing the money.
   The best chance for Noriega's attorneys appeared to be $5.8
million in cash found by U.S. troops in Noriega's offices in Panama
during the invasion. But federal prosecutors say the money was
turned over to the new government of Panama because Noriega
initially denied ownership, a claim disputed by Noriega's defense.
   Noriega's defense and many independent legal experts have cried
foul over the money issue.
   Rubino said trying to defend Noriega on a restricted budget made
the case into David vs. Goliath.
   Legal scholars said the fact that the United States took away
Noriega's money, then gave him a severely limited legal defense,
would reflect badly on the nation's legal system.
   Noriega is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside Miami on charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes to
turn Panama into a way station for Colombia's Medellin cocaine
cartel.

<TEXT>
   Fighting between taxi
operators and township residents killed six people in Natal
Province, police said, and the government lifted unrest
restrictions Friday in 14 black townships.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok last month declared the
townships near Johannesburg unrest areas, giving police wide powers
to put down violence and detain people.
   The townships had been wracked by black factional fighting that
killed more than 800 people since it broke out in August. Fighting
has eased recently.
   Among the townships freed from unrest restrictions Friday were
Soweto, Sebokeng and Kagiso. Some of the worst fighting occurred
there, pitting Zulu supporters of the conservative Inkatha Freedom
Party against Xhosa and other blacks linked to the African National
Congress.
   The ANC, led by Nelson Mandela, is the country's leading group
challenging the white-led government.
   With Friday's announcement, only two townships near Pretoria and
two near Cape Town remained designated as unrest areas. Violence in
those townships has been linked to local issues.
   Police Capt. Kwazi Nene told the government-run South African
Broadcasting Corp. that the clashes Thursday and early Friday in
the Folweni township south of Durban followed a commuter boycott of
taxi operators this week.
   The residents, reacting after the government dropped fuel
prices, said taxi fares should be lowered, the network reported.
Youths began stoning taxis on Thursday after operators refused to
lower the fares, it said.
   Nene said several houses belonging to taxi operators were burned
during the clashes, which left six people dead and continued
overnight, the broadcasting system reported.
   Also Friday, the government of the Bophuthatswana black homeland
said it wants to join negotiations on South Africa's future and
will consider calling a referendum on whether to rejoin South
Africa.
   Homeland President Lucas Mangope previously has refused to
consider giving up the homeland's nominal independence. Only South
Africa recognizes the sovereignty of Bophuthatswana and three of
the other nine homelands - Transkei, Ciskei and Venda.
   The ANC and other opposition groups consider the homelands part
of South Africa's apartheid system of segregation and white
dominance. Anti-apartheid groups call for Bophuthatswana to rejoin
South Africa.
   The ANC and South Africa's white-led government have held talks
since May on ending apartheid and allowing the black majority to
share power. The talks are aimed at setting up negotiations with
all political groups on a new constitution.

<TEXT>
   Authorities on Friday recovered the
bodies of the 46 victims of the Alitalia jetliner crash and
investigators combed wreckage for clues as to what caused the
aircraft to slam into a hillside.
   Zurich airport spokesman ndreas Meier said experts planned to
try to reconstruct the pieces of the DC-9 to help determine whether
it exploded before crashing five miles from Zurich's Kloten
airport.
   Maier said pilot error was the most likely cause of the crash
because radar data showed the plane was flying about 1,000 feet
below the correct altitude for preparing to land. He said the data
suggested the experienced, 47-year-old pilot ``misjudged his
altitude.''
   Maier noted that records of the pilot's radio contacts with the
control tower at Zurich airport did not indicate any problems. He
said the instrument landing system for the runway the plane was
assigned to was operating normally.
   Some witnesses said the pilot seemed to gun the engine just
before impact, as if he was trying to regain height.
   Alitalia officials suggested, however, that the plane's
electronic navigation system may have failed.
   The airline said seven Americans, 10 Swiss, six Spaniards, three
Germans, two Japanese and 11 Italians, including the crew of six,
perished in the disaster.
   It said one passenger each was from India, Lebanon, the
Netherlands, Finland and Britain. There was no information on the
nationality of the remaining two passengers.
   Identification of the bodies was expected to take weeks as most
victims and their possessions were burned beyond recognition by the
flames that gutted the aircraft when it crashed and broke into
pieces.
   The plane's two ``black boxes'' were recovered Thursday and will
be sent to Britain for evaluation. One recorder tracks flight data
and the other tapes cockpit conversation.
   Alitalia said the two-engine DC-9, built in 1974, was last
inspected 10 days before the crash.

<TEXT>
   The 1,100 combat aircraft taking
part in the Imminent Thunder exercises are a visible reminder to
Iraq that the multinational force assembled in the Persian Gulf has
double its air power, defense analysts said Thursday.
   ``That must be a very sobering thought for President Saddam
Hussein,'' said Paul Beaver, publisher of Jane's Defense Weekly, a
respected publication on military matters.
   A news blackout remained in effect on the second day of the
exercise Thursday in eastern Saudi Arabia, which will include a
mock amphibious invasion by U.S. Marines with air cover and naval
support.
   British fighter aircraft are taking part along with U.S. and
Saudi Arabian air, naval and marine units, a British military
spokesman said Thursday. British said it had more than 50 planes
participating in the exercise.
   The U.S. military announcement Wednesday mentioned only U.S. and
Saudi forces.
   Defense analysts said the main aim of the exercise is to put
together the air-strike capability of the multinational force
deployed in the Persian Gulf following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
on Aug. 2.
   There is also an element of ``psychological warfare,''
especially in the choice of the name Imminent Thunder for the
exercise, the experts said. U.S. officials have said the name has
no special significance.
   ``It is all clearly part of a psychological campaign,'' said
Edward Foster, a researcher with the London-based Royal United
Services Institute for Defense Studies. He said the exercises could
be ``a form of increasing the pressure.''
   Imminent Thunder involves the largest use of aircraft in a
single training exercise since the creation of the multinational
force. The exercise also involves 1,000 U.S. Marines and 16 ships,
including the aircraft carrier USS Midway.
   The exact location of Imminent Thunder in eastern Saudi Arabia
was not revealed. Press reports have said the exercise would be 10
miles from the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. No live ammunition will be
fired, officials said.
   ``We all know air power is going to be very important in any
conflict, and one would be very surprised if they didn't have an
exercise like this to see whether they could keep track of all
those planes in the air on a radar screen without hitting each
other,'' said Col. Andrew Duncan of the London-based International
Institute of Strategic Studies.
   Beaver, of the Defense Weekly, said the U.S.-dominated
multinational force was making sure its command and control system
works.
   ``There's no doubt about it - the most important thing in any
land battle is to gain air superiority ... and the most important
thing is making sure everybody knows what they're doing,'' he said.
   ``They need to know that Saudis can refuel American aircraft and
Brits can rearm and refuel someone else's aircraft,'' he said.
   All the analysts spoke in telephone interviews from Britain.
   The amphibious landing, expected Sunday, will be the fourth by
elements of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Battalion, which has been
floating off the coast since the deployment began. The other three
have been on the southern part of the Arabian peninsula in Oman and
Bahrain.
   By keeping the Marines at sea, Foster said, ``You're always
keeping the Iraqis guessing. You're always keeping the amphibious
option open.''
   Iraq has a 1 million-member army, but only something over 500
combat aircraft. About 430,000 of Iraq's soldiers are deployed in
or near Kuwait.
   The multinational force of the United States and 25 other
nations numbers about 330,000 forces, including 230,000 American
soldiers. But President Bush has said Washington is sending 200,000
more to ensure that the force has an offensive capability.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Friday rejected a
Soviet envoy's suggestion that a solution to the Persian Gulf
crisis be linked to Israel's occupation of land claimed by
Palestinians.
   Baker said there could be no rewards for aggression. He spoke in
Brussels, Belgium, on the first leg of a 12-day foreign trip that
will include talks on the gulf situation.
   At the United Nations, diplomats said Baker was trying to
persuade Security Council foreign ministers to travel to New York
to adopt a resolution authorizing force to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
Foreign ministers occupy their country's seats on the council only
in grave situations.
   President Bush left Friday to join Baker for further talks with
allies, then spend Thanksgiving with U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia.
It would be the first presidential visit to front-line troops since
the Vietnam War.
   Despite the Bush administration's growing impatience with Saddam
Hussein, there have been increasing calls to avoid rushing into
war. Egypt, the Soviet envoy and U.S. congressmen urged on Thursday
that more time be allowed for the U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq to
work.
   Oil prices fell Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange as
traders decided that the outbreak of war could take some time. The
price fell $1.87 to $29.25 a barrel.
   Also expressing optimism were seven peace activists, who left
London on Friday for Baghdad hoping to set up camps on both sides
of the Saudi-Kuwait border. They said they hoped to deter any
fighting.
   A news blackout, meanwhile, remained in effect on the second day
of the Imminent Thunder military exercise in eastern Saudi Arabia.
Iraq has condemned the exercise, calling it a ``provocation.''
   On Thursday, the Soviet Union's top Middle East envoy, Yevgeny
Primakov, said the world should do everything possible to persuade
Saddam to withdraw from Kuwait - including agreeing to talks on the
Palestinian question.
   In an interview Friday with NBC-TV, Primakov said the Saddam
seems to be softening his ideas on the crisis. ``A kind of
evolution is taking place in his views,'' Primakov said, ``and
maybe it makes me more optimistic than before.''
   Despite his other comments, he insisted the United States and
the Soviet Union are moving ``in one direction'' to oust Iraq from
Kuwait.
   Baker said earlier Friday that Washington and Moscow have indeed
forged a common position on the gulf crisis. He said they agreed
that ``we should not link this gulf issue with other issues.''
   Primakov might have been speaking for himself and not for the
Soviet government, Baker suggested.
   Saddam has said he might withdraw from Kuwait if Israel pulled
out of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, seized in the 1967 Middle East
war. But the United States and its allies have said Iraq must
withdraw unconditionally.
   Baker also said the Bush administration was consulting with its
allies on whether to seek a U.N. resolution authorizing military
force against Iraq if peaceful means fail.
   ``It is the view of the United States that force as an option
cannot and should not be ruled out,'' he said.
   Baker, also in Brussels for trade talks with the 12-nation
European Economic Community, meets Saturday in Geneva with the
foreign ministers of Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and Zaire - all Security
Council members.
   An aide to Baker said Thursday the United States would like to
introduce the resolution this month, while its diplomat presides
over the council. Yemen, a pro-Iraqi member of the 15-nation
council, holds the presidency for December.
   U.N. diplomats said Baker was consulting with Security Council
members on bringing foreign ministers to New York to adopt such a
resolution.
   ``I do not exclude the possibility that in November, the
Americans ... may wish to stress the importance of the meeting by
holding it at the ministerial level,'' said the Canadian ambassador
to the U.N., Yves Fortier.
   About 330,000 allied soldiers are stationed in Saudi Arabia.
They face 430,000 Iraqi troops deployed in southern Iraq and
Kuwait, which Saddam invaded on Aug. 2 in a dispute over oil, land
and money.
   Bush has said he will send an additional 200,000 troops to Saudi
Arabia. Military officials there said Friday the new deployment
will be much swifter than the three months it took to bring the
original 230,000 troops to the gulf.
   Allied troops were participating in the six-day Imminent Thunder
military exercise, which includes a mock U.S. Marine amphibious
invasion with air cover and close air and naval support of ground
forces.
   Defense analysts said the 1,100 combat aircraft taking part were
a reminder to Iraq that the allies have double its air power.
   ``That must be a very sobering thought for President Saddam
Hussein,'' said Paul Beaver, publisher of Jane's Defense Weekly.
   The seven peace activists said they hoped to prevent fighting
from breaking out. They headed for Iraq Friday and planned to set
up peace camps on both sides of the Kuwaiti-Saudi border.
   ``We are well aware of the consequences of our actions, but this
is a point of principle in the traditions of Gandhi,'' said Pat
Arrowsmith, a 60-year-old peace campaigner.
   The group included activists from Britain, India, Belgium and
Ghana. They said they would be joined by others, including Yusuf
Islam, formerly the pop singer Cat Stevens, once the camps were
established.
   Iraq has not ruled out a peaceful solution to the crisis, said
the Iranian foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati. He was returning
from two days in Baghdad.
   Velayati said it appeared Iraq's leaders had not yet made up
their minds.
   ``One cannot say with certainty that it will go either way,
staying in Kuwait, and putting into practice the annexation of
Kuwait, or the withdrawal from Kuwait,'' Velayati said.

<HEAD>Chinese News Returns to Revolutionary Greeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a return to revolutionary rhetoric, Chinese
newscasters have been ordered to greet their viewers as
``comrades,'' the country's state-run television announced Friday.
   The revival of the greeting is part of a general return to
revolutionary slogans and orthodox ideology since Communist leaders
crushed last year's pro-democracy movement. Books, movies,
newspapers and television shows now carry more pronounced
ideological messages.
   Chinese news anchors had been opening their broadcasts with the
greeting, ``Good evening, viewers.'' For the first time in years,
news anchors are now greeting viewers as ``comrades.''
   China Central Television's evening news department said Friday
that an order had come from above to use the revolutionary
greeting. On Wednesday, when it was first used, the anchor opened
the show tersely: ``Comrades!''
   But the format of the greeting is apparently still being
experimented with: on Friday night's newscast, the anchor opened
with, ``Viewers, comrades, hello!''
   In the first decades after the 1949 Communist victory in China,
``comrade'' was the only acceptable way of hailing a shop clerk or
waitress or addressing a colleague.
   But in recent years, ``mister'' and ``miss'' - once denounced as
bourgeois - have become common. Anyone using ``comrade'' draws
stares and laughter.
   ``Even the anchorpeople laughed the first time'' the television
news used it, said a man who answered the telephone at the news
department. He refused to give his name.
   ``Nonetheless, we are trying it,'' he said. ``We will see what
the response is like.'' He said higher-level officials indicated
they hope it will usher in a general revival of the word.
   The order came two weeks after the People's Daily, the Communist
Party newspaper, published a letter praising ``comrade'' as a
glorious title.

   An epidemic of yellow fever has killed
69 people in northern Cameroon, the government said Friday.
   Ninety others are ill with the fever, a tropical disease
transmitted by mosquito bites.
   All those affected are in the northern provinces of Mayo-Sava
and Mayo-Tsanaga, on the border with Nigeria, the government said.
   Provincial medical authorities said many people had refused to
be vaccinated because of rumors the injections cause sterility and
because of certain traditional beliefs.
   Health workers in the north of this West African nation have
begun a campaign to reassure people and encourage them to be
vaccinated, officials said.

   Former President Carter on Friday
declared his opposition to a possible U.S. invasion of Iraq,
saying, ``I wouldn't be willing to give my life to invade someone
else's land.''
   During a question-and-answer session with 1,200 high school
students, Carter said higher oil prices and the potential loss of
American jobs were not strong enough reasons for the United States
to launch a war in the Middle East.
   ``I don't believe that those are the kinds of reasons for us to
sacrifice human life in the desert of Saudi Arabia and Iraq,''
Carter said during the start of a three-day conference studying his
administration at Hofstra University.
   U.S. troops were deployed to defend Saudi Arabia shortly after
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   In Brussels, Belgium, on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State James
A. Baker III said Washington was consulting with its allies on
whether to seek a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of
force to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
   Carter said that invading a country takes three times as much
military might as it does to defend one. He also noted that Iraqis'
religious beliefs make it an honor to die for their country.
   ``I don't have any doubts the U.S. would prevail against Iraq,
but the effects would be deleterious, politically,'' said Carter.
   ``I would offer my life to defend my family and country against
an invading force, but I wouldn't be willing to give my life to
invade someone else's land,'' he said.
   Carter spoke at the eighth presidential conference Hofstra has
sponsored. Carter, the 39th U.S. chief executive, was president
from 1976 to 1980, when he lost a re-election bid to Ronald Reagan.
   Carter said President Bush made the right move by seeking U.N.
support after Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait.
   ``Bush did a superb job in martialing support to prevent what
was considered a likely invasion of Saudi Arabia,'' he said. ``But
lately the president is shifting from a defensive role to an
offensive role.''

<HEAD>A Decline For The First Time In A Decade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in a decade, the nations of
the world are spending less on weapons, the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency reported Friday. Among them is the Soviet Union.
   Developing nations accounted for most of the decline, spending
$25.1 billion less in 1988 than the year before. The overall drop
was $36 billion.
   Even so, spending on arms surpassed $1 trillion for the second
year in a row.
   Military spending in developing countries has been dropping
since 1984. The $11 billiion decline among the wealthier nations is
the first drop in a decade.
   The Soviet Union, meanwhile, spent $299.8 billion on arms in
1988, a drop of 4 percent. The United States led the world with
$307.7 billion, showing a slight increase over 1987.
   The Soviets are still in first place, however, in exporting
weapons - $21 billion worth or 44 percent of the world's total in
1988. U.S. arms exports were $14.3 billion, the agency said.
   The end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988 contributed to a drop in
military spending in the Middle East. At $60.7 billon it was at the
lowest level in a decade.
   South Asian military spending continued to grow faster than any
other region of the world - with an annual rate from 1978 to 1988
of 6.5 percent.
   The figures were all given in terms of dollars of 1988 buying
power.

<TEXT>
   A mother was sentenced to life in
prison Friday for smothering her 4-year-old son and now faces
charges in Texas in the deaths of four other children, three of
them her daughters.
   Diana Lumbrera, 32, repeated her innocence when Finney County
District Court Judge J. Stephen Nyswonger sentenced her to life in
the Kansas Penitentiary.
   ``All I've got to tell you is that I didn't murder my son the
way you all are accusing me,'' Mrs. Lumbrera said.
   She was convicted Oct. 3 in the death of her son, Jose Antonio
Lumbrera, in her Garden City home last May.
   In August, a Parmer County, Texas, grand jury indicted Mrs.
Lumbrera in the deaths of three daughters - 3-month old Joanna
Lumbrera, 2-year-old Melinda Ann Garza and 3-year-old Melissa
Lumbrera. The three girls died between 1976 and 1982, before she
moved to Kansas.
   Autopsies and death certificates ruled the girls died of natural
causes. But the murder charge in Kansas prompted Texas authorities
to reopen the cases.
   On Sept. 10, Lumbrera was accused of first-degree murder of
Erica Lenore Aleman, the 6-week-old daughter of a cousin.
   Prosecutors contend she killed her children for life insurance
money. They have not released their contention of a motive in the
death of Erica Aleman.
   Nyswonger approved a motion to transport Mrs. Lumbrera back to
Texas immediately after Friday's sentencing hearing.
   ``It's Diana's request that we advance the court calendar and
that she be allowed to return to Texas to clear herself of the
charges pending there,'' said Mrs. Lumbrera's defense attorney,
Michael Quint.
   Quint said an appeal to the sentencing should be ready by
Monday. The strongest grounds for appeal were extensive pre-trial
publicity Quint contended kept his client from getting a fair
trial.

   President Bush on Friday vetoed legislation
designed to crack down on countries and firms that traffic in
chemical weapons. At the same time, Bush issued an executive order
he said would accomplish the principal goals of the bill.
   The order imposes new export controls on chemical and biological
weapons and calls for sanctions against violators.
   Another provision of the bill would have forbidden trade with
Cuba by overseas subsidiaries of U.S. companies, a ban to which
U.S. allies strongly objected.
   The president said in a statement his major objection to the
legislation ``is not the requirement of sanctions, but the rigid
way in which they are imposed.''
   He said the bill would force him to impose sanctions against
countries with whom the United States might want to keep smooth
relations.
   Bush's order:
   -Prohibits exports that would help foreign chemical and
biological weapons programs.
   -Controls exports that would assist foreign countries in
producing and procuring chemical weapons.
   -Requires diplomats to work for a new international agreement
banning chemical weapons, with adequate verification procedures,
and to seek negotiations with other countries to cooperate in
blocking the spread of chemical weapons.
   -Directs sanctions against foreign countries and their citizens
who use chemical or biological wepaons or ``are making substantial
preparations to use such weapons'' or have developed or stockpiled
such weapons in violation of international law.
   ``The mandatory imposition of unilateral sacntions as provided
in this bill would harm U.S. economic interest and provoke friendly
countries who are essential to our efforts to resist Iraqi
aggression,'' he said.
   The sanctions Bush directed against foreign countries involved
in chemical weapons proliferation include cutting of U.S. foreign
aid and arms exports to that country, opposition to any loans to
the country from international lending organizations, restriction
of U.S. imports from the country, and a variety of other measures.
   The State Department said the bill could impede U.S. foreign
policy in the current climate of alliances with old foes, would be
``objectionable intrusiveness into Executive Branch prerogatives''
and would be ``potentially fatal to our efforts to cooperate with
friends and allies.''
   The State Department also opposed a provision aimed at
preventing overseas subsidiaries of American companies from trading
with Cuba. Britain, Canada and other countries where these
subsidiaries operate have complained the legislation would infringe
on their sovereignty.
   During a meeting this past week, Canadian External Affairs
Minister Joe Clark told Secretary of State James A. Baker III the
requirement was ``unacceptable.'' U.S. overseas subsidiaries do
about a $320 million business with Cuba annually.
   Computer and high-tech industries backed the bill, but the U.S.
CHamber of Commerce wanted a veto.
   The Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Bush to sign the bill, based
on its investigation that it said showed 207 western companies
helped provide Iraq's President Saddam Hussein with chemical and
biological weapons.
   The center said those included 86 from Germany and 18 from the
United States.

<HEAD>No Sure Evidence of Explosives Handled By Birmingham Six: Lawyers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Peirce cq in 8th graf</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense lawyers said Friday that a government
report casts doubt on the 1974 murder convictions of six Irishmen
for two bombings that killed 21 people.
   The report concluded no one could be sure any of the six had
handled explosives, the lawyers said.
   Evidence at least two of the so-called Birmingham Six had traces
of nitroglycerine on their hands when arrested was crucial to their
convictions.
   The six have waged a campaign to prove they were convicted and
sentenced to life unjustly. Last August the government ordered the
Court of Appeal to review their convictions. Home Secretary David
Waddington cited apparent discrepancies in police notes of an
interview with Richard McIlkenny, one of the six.
   Ivan Geffen, a lawyer for Gerry Hunter, another of the six, said
a report by the Home Office forensic service cast doubt on the
convictions in the Nov. 21, 1974 bombings of two Birmingham pubs by
the Irish Republican Army.
   The new report was commissioned by the Director of Public
Prosecutions, which is deciding whether to contest the new appeal.
   ``No one can be sure beyond reasonable doubt that any of the six
men had handled explosives,'' Geffen quoted the report as saying.
   He said the Court of Appeal, which affirmed the verdicts in
1988, ``made a grave error of judgment in the way it interpreted
the scientific evidence.''
   Gareth Peirce, a lawyer for the other five men, said the
government report would likely be ``the final nail in the coffin of
the prosecution's case.''
   Five of the six men were arrested hours after the bombings, as
they were about to board a ferry to Northern Ireland for the
funeral of an IRA man.
   McIlkenny, Hunter, Johnny Walker, Patrick Hill, Hugh Callaghan
and Billy Power were convicted of murder for the bombings, which
killed 21 and injured 162.
   They were the deadliest bombings the IRA has carried out in
England in its campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland.

<TEXT>
   As White House reporters prepared to fly off
with President Bush to Europe and the Middle East, they got the
startling news that they may not have places to stay when Bush goes
to South America next month.
   Hotel rooms will be arranged by the White House in Santiago,
Chile, Brasilia and Caracas, but reporters are on their own in
Buenos Aires, and in Montevideo and Punta del Este, Uruguay.
   The only explanation given by White House officials was that
hotel rooms for White House staff and the full press corps could
not be procured.
   The rooms had been all arranged for the original dates of the
trip in September. But Bush had to postpone the trip under pressure
of budget negotiations with Congress and the military buildup
against Iraq in the Persian Gulf.
   In Buenos Aires, where Bush addresses the national congress and
meets with President Carlos Menem, a Jehovah's Witness convention
was said to have taken all available rooms.
   ``All press travelling on the trip are advised to make proper
hotel reservations in Buenos Aires as soon as possible,'' the White
House said in its notice.
   There was no announcement on what caused the shortage in Uruguay
where Bush will stay one night in Punta del Este.
   ``There is no further hotel space available in either Montevideo
or Punta del Este,'' the White House notice said.
   The press charter plane that accompanies Bush will fly to Buenos
Aires after Bush's Uruguay appearances, and those who have been
able to find rooms there will have shelter for the night.
   Generally, the White House travel office canvasses the press
corps to see who will accompany Bush and then takes care of all the
travel and hotel arrangements, with news organizations paying the
bills incurred by their employees.

   Residents of this town of 170 people dealt
with feelings of helplessness and sorrow on Friday after a
school-bus collision killed two people and injured 21 others.
   ``It is just horrendous,'' said Sheila Olson, principal at the
Miltona Science Magnet School.
   Olson said many students wanted to rush to the accident scene
near the school because they had just gotten off the bus and some
had older brothers and sisters still aboard.
   ``I still can't believe it happened,'' Olson said. ``It's just
not real. And the kids, many were crying, wanting their parents and
you just feel so helpless. You just don't know what to do.''
   The Douglas County Sheriff's Department identified the victims
as bus driver Fred Beman, 66, of Alexandria, and 9-year-old
Kristian Rindahl of rural Carlos, who attended Zion Lutheran School
in Alexandria.
   Five of the injured were in stable condition at Douglas County
Hospital in Alexandria with a variety of fractures and internal
injuries, said hospital spokeswoman Verna Pauley.
   Fourteen people had been treated and released and another two
were waiting to be discharged late Friday, she said.
   The accident happened around 7:30 a.m. Friday in Miltona, about
100 miles northwest of Minneapolis. The cause was not immediately
known, but Douglas County Sheriff Terry Eilers said preliminary
interviews with witnesses indicated the driver may have rolled the
vehicle into the train.
   Deanna Schultz, secretary for the Miltona school, said the bus
had just dropped off some children at the school and was on its way
to the high school in Alexandria.
   Bob Stier, transportation supervisor for the Alexandria school
system, which owns the bus, said about 25 students were aboard when
the accident happened.
   ``The front end of the bus got hit,'' Stier said. ``It was a
flat-nosed bus and it (the train) hit the side where the driver
was.
   ``The bus got spun around, then the front end of the bus hit a
light pole,'' Stier said, adding that the train did not derail.
There were no injuries on the train, officials said.
   Alexandria school Superintendent George Cassell said Beman had
been with the school district 10 years and had an excellent driving
record.
   ``We are in shock. (We're) just having a hard time understanding
what happened today,'' he said. Cassell said state and federal
investigators were expected to arrive Friday afternoon.
   The school district brought in a team of counselors to help
comfort the children, Olson said.
   ``I just simply stood in the halls as students were walking back
and forth between their rooms and just shared hugs with some of the
children who were in tears and very frightened by it,'' said Nancy
Larson, a Lutheran minister from Carlos.

<TEXT>
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis sought
Friday to portray his four-day trip to Britain as a success,
although he failed to win formal British support for Lithuanian
independence.
   In a speech to the parliament of the Baltic republic,
Landsbergis said ``the political forces of Britain support
Lithuania's striving for independence'' even though ``the stand of
the Thatcher government is more restrained.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher met with Landsbergis
during his visit this week. Apparently reluctant to add to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's domestic woes, she did not endorse
Lithuania's drive to secede from the Soviet Union.
   Lithuania declared independence on March 11 but suspended the
declaration last summer in return for the Kremlin's agreement to
halt an economic embargo and enter talks. After weeks of
preliminary meetings, the formal negotiations toward possible
independence were scheduled to begin at the end of this month.
   But Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said in an
intervew published Friday that the Lithuanian government would not
hold talks with the national government headed by Soviet Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   Prunskiene said Thursday at a Moscow press conference that
Ryzhkov had shown no willingness to compromise.
   In the interview with the newspaper Lietuvos Ritas, she said
Lithuania should appeal to Gorbachev to intervene in the
negotiations.

<HEAD>Dealer Says State Refused Halt Sale In Berkeley Hostage Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL CERRITO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Department of Justice
refused to block the sale of a handgun to a man who later held
dozens hostage in a Berkeley tavern and killed a student, a gun
shop owner said Friday.
   Gun dealer Bob Weaver said he tried to prevent sale of a weapon
to Mehrdad Dashti, a former mental patient, before his Sept. 27
rampage in the Durant Hotel bar.
   John Sheehy, 22, was killed and nine other University of
California students were wounded before police stormed Henry's
Publick House &amp; Grille, freed 33 hostages and killed Dashti, a
30-year-old Iranian immigrant.
   Weaver said he went so far as to file down the hammer of a 9mm
Ruger pistol before he handed it over to Dashti. Dashti soon
returned the defective weapon and Weaver said he finally had to
sell Dashti a working gun.
   The type of gun Dashti used in the shootings remains unclear.
   Details of the sale surfaced in a thick file obtained by the San
Francisco Chronicle from Berkeley police under the state Freedom of
Information law.
   ``We knew the guy was loopy,'' Weaver said. ``We told the
Justice Department about him, but they said there was nothing they
could do about it.''
   Repeated telephone calls Friday for comment from the state
Justice Department were unsuccessful. Weaver, saying he feared
retribution, refused to give the name of the person he spoke with
at the Justice Department.
   The police records backed Weaver's story, saying that all
through the state-mandated 15-day waiting period in handgun sales,
``Weaver had the gun in the store, but was very reluctant to
release it to Dashti.''
   The waiting period for anyone who wants to buy a handgun in
California is used for checks with the state Justice Department in
Sacramento to see whether the potential buyer has been convicted of
a felony or certified as insane by a court.
   Although Dashti got into minor trouble with the law and had been
a patient at the Berkeley Mental Health Clinic, it was legal for
him to buy handguns. Alameda County authorities had assessed Dashti
as a paranoid schizophrenic.
   Police records said Dashti bought the defective Ruger from
Weaver in March. During the 15-day waiting period ``two of Dashti's
friends came to the store pleading with (Weaver) not to sell Dashti
the gun,'' the records said.
   Weaver, who owns the Old West Gun Room in El Cerrito, said he
and Berkeley police were convinced Dashti was mentally unstable.
   On the night he took the hstages, Dashti called a friend to
have a late-night drink. After ordering, Dashti opened up his
briefcase, produced a handgun and opened fire, police said.

   An Air Jamaica jet carrying 59
passengers collapsed on its belly and skidded to a halt Friday
after the back wheels broke on landing, airport officials said.
   The passengers were safely evacuated and no injuries were
reported.
   Witnesses said the Boeing 727, leaning on its left wing, slid
or hundreds of yards before coming to a stop on the runway. A
wheel caught fire but firefighters quickly extinguished it,
officials said.
   The Air Jamaica jet was on a regular flight from Kingston, the
capital of Jamaica, to Curacao, a Dutch island territory in the
Caribbean just off Venezuela.
   Most of the passengers were Jamaican tourists.
   Curacao International Airport was closed to large aircraft
Friday so authorities could remove the plane from the landing
strip.

<HEAD>Negotiators For Unions, Newspapers Pressed By Strike Deadline</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 11 grafs to UPDATE with clock stopped on strike

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators agreed to continue talks beyond
a Friday strike deadline that was set by about 4,500 union
employees of the San Francisco Bay area's three largest daily
newspapers.
   Ten unions and management of the San Francisco Chronicle, San
Francisco Examiner and San Jose Mercury News made progress on
salary proposals and stopped the clock on the threatened 5 p.m.
strike, said Johnny Miller, a negotiator for the Newspaper Guild.
   ``It's an indication there was some movement,'' he said.
   The unions asked for a 20 percent pay raise and a four-day
workweek. Management suggested a wage freeze during the proposed
three-year contract, with $80 lump sum payments every six months to
each employee.
   Jessie Knight, management spokesman and senior vice president at
the Examiner, said that despite the gap, negotiations were
productive.
   Knight refused to confirm management's specific pay offer.
   Talks were to continue into the night.
   Sally Lehrman, spokeswoman for the Newspaper Guild and an
Examiner business writer, said workers wouldn't be satisfied with a
3 percent to 4 percent pay raise, although some nervous employees
said they could live with that rather than give up paychecks in a
strike.
   All the old, three-year contracts, most of which expired in
February, gave employees an average of 3 percent to 5 percent pay
and benefit increases each year. The union workers covered include
reporters, editors, drivers, secretaries, librarians and press
operators.
   A federal mediator was brought in this week to help resolve the
contract dispute.
   Nearly every reporter and photographer withheld bylines and
credits lines Friday and planned to continue the protest until a
contract is approved. It was the first byline strike in the
125-year history of the two San Francisco newspapers.
   Mercury News managers have prepared for weeks to publish without
union staff. The San Francisco newspapers also planned to publish.
   San Francisco's last newspaper strike was in 1968, when workers
for the Examiner and the Chronicle walked. The strike lasted 55
days. The Mercury News was last struck in 1959, for four months.
   ``Whatever happens today, there's a general feeling that we'll
be happy one way or another to get off this tightrope we've been
walking on without a contract,'' said Angelo Figueroa, Examiner
city hall reporter. ``There's been so much speculation about a wage
freeze that there's just this desire to get this over with.''
   Top scale pay is $800 a week for reporters and editors, $669 for
clerical and library workers and $675 for drivers.
   Non-economic issues were resolved by Thursday night, said
Richard Jordan, chief negotiator for the San Francisco Newspaper
Agency, which operates the Chronicle and the Examiner under a Joint
Operating Agreement.
   The agreement merges the two newspapers' advertising,
circulation and business operations but maintains separate
editorial departments.
   Neil Chethik, chairman of the Newspaper Guild for the Mercury
News, and other union officials said the strike deadline was set to
force management to talk on pay issues.
   The morning Chronicle, with weekday circulation of about
560,000, publishes jointly with the Examiner on Sunday for a
combined circulation of about 725,000. The afternoon Examiner has a
weekday circulation of about 138,000. The two newspapers entered
into the Joint Operating Agreement in 1965.
   The San Jose Mercury News has a daily circulation of about
275,000 during the week and about 329,000 on Sundays.

<HEAD>Salcido Jury Says Death In Gas Chamber</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury on Friday said Ramon Salcido
should die in the gas chamber for killing his wife, two of his
daughters and four other people in a 1988 wine country rampage.
   Salcido, 29, had a faraway stare when a Spanish interpreter
translated the jury's decision. One juror wept as the verdict was
delivered.
   ``He doesn't know where he is,'' defense attorney Marteen Miller
said. ``He's not insane, but he's a little goofy.''
   Jurors said Salcido's aloof demeanor and apparent lack of
remorse during the trial played a significant role in their
decision to give him the death penalty instead of life in prison
without parole.
   Defense attorneys claimed cocaine, alcohol and jealousy
triggered Salcido to kill his wife, two young daughters,
mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law and his boss. Another daughter,
2-year-old Carmina, survived after Salcido slit her throat and
dumped her in a ravine with her sisters.
   ``I was expecting a mad-dog killer and I didn't see that,'' jury
foreman Dr. John Williams, 36, a medical researcher from Portola
Valley, said of his first reaction to Salcido. ``I saw him then as
a deer caught in the headlights, an almost pathetic man who may
have gone crazy for awhile.
   ``But in going over the evidence, I decided this was not the
case,'' Williams said. ``His crime fit his personality. He did it
in a coldhearted way, and he deserved the death penalty.''
   Sonoma County prosecutor Peter Bumerts described Salcido as
``fairly cold and calculating, more like a fox than a mad dog.''
   Juror Dory Horn, 49, of South San Francisco, wept as the verdict
was read. She said deciding the case ``was the hardest thing I've
ever had to do.''
   ``You know you're deciding to take somebody else's life,'' she
said. ``It's not over, and it won't be. There's no peace at all.''
   Superior Court Judge Reginald Littrell, on assignment from
Sierra County, set formal sentencing for Dec. 17.
   An appeal to the state Supreme Court is automatic in California
death penalty cases, and the defense believes it may have at least
two other chances to save Salcido's life - a protest by the Mexican
government and a ruling by federal court.
   Miller said he would file a writ with the U.S. District Court in
San Francisco arguing the county did not have jurisdiction over the
death penalty because of an extradition treaty with Mexico.
   Salcido, who fled to his home in Mexico after the killings, was
delivered to Sonoma County officials by Mexican authorities.
   Miller claimed the Mexican government was ``fraudulently
misled'' into releasing Salcido under U.S. officials' claims he was
an American citizen.
   The state Supreme Court already turned down Miller's petition on
Salcido's release in Mexico.
   California has not held an execution since 1967, and about 280
condemned prisoners are now on death row.
   The jury on Oct. 30 found Salcido guilty of six counts of
first-degree murder, one count of second-degree murder and two
counts of attempted murder.
   He was convicted of shooting or slashing to death his wife,
Angela, his 4-year-old and 22-month-old daughters, Sofia and
Teresa, his mother-in-law, Marion Richards, her 12-year-old and
8-year-old daughters, Ruth and Maria, and Tracey Toovey, 35, the
winemaster at Grand Cru winery in Glen Ellen.
   The jury also convicted Salcido of attempting to murder his
daughter Carmina, and Kenneth Butti, his supervisor at the winery.
   The defense never disputed Salcido was the killer.
   But Miller had sought a verdict of second-degree murder or
manslaughter, saying drugs had put Salcido in a ``psychotic
depression.''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 150 priests took part
in an outdoor Mass Friday evening to mark a year since six Jesuit
priest-educators were slain by army troops.
   Seventeen Roman Catholic bishops, including four U.S. prelates,
co-celebrated Mass for about 2,000 people in a parking lot at the
University of Central America, where the priests taught and were
hailed Friday as martyrs.
   The wooden stage holding the altar was draped with a banner
reading ``How Long?'' The phrase is from the biblical book of
Apocalypse, which has the souls of those slain for their devotion
crying out to the Lord: ``How long until you do justice and demand
an accounting for our blood from the inhabitants of earth?''
   On Nov. 16, army troops broke into the campus residence and
murdered the Revs. Ignacio Ellacuria, Ignacio Martin-Baro, Segundo
Montes, Amado Lopez, Juan Ramon Moreno and Joaquin Lopez.
   Their housekeeper and her daughter were killed to eliminate
witnesses, according to testimony from several soldiers.
   An army colonel, three lieutenants and four soldiers are under
arrest and charged with the murders. The case has yet to go to
trial.
   Portraits of the slain priests, the housekeeper and her
daughter, hung from a wire stretched above the altar. The setting
sun illuminated, one by one from behind, the images on white cloth
stretched over wooden frames.
   The Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, the Jesuit leader for Central
America, delivered the homily.
   ``Our companions' life and death oblige the developed world to
make commitments - a developed world that cannot content itself
with good words uttered from its position of comfort as long as the
relationship between rich countries of the north and the poor
immense majorities of the south remains a fraud that generates
injustice and inequality,'' he said.
   The far right had long considered the Jesuits subversives for
their contention that the 11-year-old Salvadoran civil war stems
from injustice, repression and poverty - rather than international
Communist expansion.
   The massacre has been a sticking point in relations between the
Salvadoran and U.S. governments. Several U.S. congressmen have
accused the conservative government of Alfredo Cristiani of
foot-dragging in the case.
   The U.S. bishops who took part in Friday's ceremony were the
Revs. Walter Sullivan of Richmond, Va.; Carlos Sevilla of San
Francisco; Ricardo Ramirez of Las Cruces, N.M.; and Rembert
Weakland of Milwaukee.
   Weakland has been in the news recently over the refusal of the
Vatican to let a Swiss university grant him an honorary degree. The
Vatican is unhappy with his willingness to hear the views of
parishioners who favor abortion and his criticism of some abortion
foes as intolerant.

   Angry fans turned in their ``Milli Vanilli'' recordings Friday
and radio stations vowed to pull the pop duo off the air after
their producer revealed hunky Fab and Rob didn't sing their own way
to fame.
   ``I think they're dirty scumbuckets,'' said 9-year-old Katie
Dickman of Richmond, Ind. ``I used to like them, but not now.''
   Radio station WLOL-FM in Minneapolis declared itself ``Milli
Vanilli Free,'' saying it will no longer play the duo's hit 1988
debut album, ``Girl You Know It's True,'' which earned them a
Grammy for best new group.
   The station offered listeners an exchange of their Milli Vanilli
recordings for a CD or cassette of their choice. About 150 people
took up the station on the offer, said program director Greg
Strassell.
   ``People are mad,'' said disc jockey Paul J. Roberts of WQQK-FM
in Nashville, Tenn. ``Listeners are saying they feel like fools.
Some say they feel they should burn their compact discs and tapes.
They feel duped.''
   Milli Vanilli's German producer, Frank Farian, revealed to
reporters this week that dreadlocked pretty boys Fab and Rob -
Robert Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan - didn't sing on the album.
   Farian also said the two did nothing more than look good and lip
sync for videos and live appearances while others did all the
singing.
   In a statement Thursday, Pilatus and Morvan said they ``have
been ready, willing and able to record our own vocals and have been
prevented by Frank Farian from doing so.''
   In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Pilatus said: ``The
last two years of our lives have been a total nightmare. We've had
to lie to everybody. We are true singers, but that maniac, Frank
Farian, would never allow us to express ourselves.''
   The duo's record company, Arista Records, said they didn't know
the pair were fronts for other vocalists but were not embarrassed
by the revelation.
   Dan McKay, program director at K-LITE-FM in Los Angeles, said
the real singers are very good and deserve notice. Farian would not
identify the real vocalists, but USA Today and other newspapers
reported they are John Davis and Charles Shaw.
   ``I'm a little disappointed, but I'm not gonna stop playing the
record. It's good stuff,'' McKay said. ``Where are these people? Do
they look like Homer Simpson or something; they can't surface?''
   Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording
Arts &amp; Sciences, which administers the Grammy Awards, said an
awards subcommittee will meet in New York City on Dec. 5 to discuss
whether to revoke the duo's 1989 Grammy.
   The board of trustees will meet later that month to make a final
decision, he said.
   Greene suggested that the Grammy should be forefeited, saying
``I don't think what we've done so far should stand as it is.''
   ``We're appalled by it,'' he added at a Las Vegas news
conference. ``But our hearts go out to these two guys, because
they're very easy targets.''
   Milli Vanilli won three American Music Awards this year. Show
spokesman Paul Shefrin said organizers have not asked the group to
return those awards.
   ``The only ones who could take them back from Milli Vanilli is
the American public,'' Shefrin said.
   Some in the recording industry were not surprised by the
deception.
   ``Rumors have abounded for a long time about how little Milli
Vanilli contributed to their album,'' said Diana Baron, vice
president for publicity at A&amp;M Records.
   Roberts of WQQK said the station started a petition drive to get
Milli Vanilli's Grammy recalled. No decision had been made on
whether the station will continue to air the group's tunes.
   Station WFLZ-FM in Tampa, Fla., apologized to listeners for
carrying what it considered a ``blatant misrepresentation'' and
demanded an apology from Arista Records and Milli Vanilli's
management.
   Program manager Marc Chase said the station will boycott Milli
Vanilli records and may even go as far as boycotting all Arista
artists.
   Farian said he was forced to go public with the revelations when
Pilatus and Morvan told him they wanted to sing on the group's next
album.
   Farian said the real singers will appear on his next album - not
a Milli Vanilli album. Pilatus said he and Morvan planned to do
their own singing from now on.
   Pilatus called Farian a ``control freak.''
   ``We were afraid for two years that this day would come,''
Pilatus said. ``We've cried about it sometimes. ... But deep
inside, we wanted it to happen.''

<TEXT>
   A record store owner convicted of
obscenity for selling a sexually explicit album by the rap group 2
Live Crew lost his bid for a new trial on Friday.
   An all-white jury convicted Charles Freeman, 32, on Oct. 3 for
selling the Miami-based rappers' album ``As Nasty as They Wanna
Be.''
   Freeman's attorney, Bruce Rogow, argued Friday his client should
be granted another trial because Broward County Judge Paul Backman
gave jury instructions that both defense attorneys and prosecutors
had not agreed to.
   During deliberations, jurors had Backman define again the
state's obscenity law. Rogow said Backman went beyond the
definition in his answer, adding that jurors did not have to rely
on the testimony of expert witnesses.
   Backman denied Rogow's request, saying his instructions were
guidelines for defining obscenity.
   ``What the court did is what it felt its obligation to be under
the law, and that was to reinstruct the jury from start to finish
as it related to the totality of the law on obscenity,'' Backman
said.
   ``I'm not surprised,'' Freeman said afterward. ``You expect the
worst and that way you deal with it a little better. I think the
whole thing is a joke; it's a circus.''
   The misdemeanor conviction carries a possible one-year jail
sentence and $1,000 fine. Sentencing has not been set.
   Rogow said he would appeal.
   A federal judge in June ruled the album's lyrics obscene and
banned the album's sale in three South Florida counties. Freeman
was arrested two days later when he sold the album to undercover
police officers at his Fort Lauderdale record store.
   Three 2 Live Crew members were acquitted Oct. 20 of misdemeanor
obscenity charges stemming from a performance at a nightclub in
nearby Hollywood.

   A federal judge on Friday imposed a 10-year
prison sentence on a woman who pleaded guilty to charges she helped
bomb the U.S. Capitol seven years ago.
   Marilyn Buck also was ordered to serve a concurrent five-year
prison term for conspiracy in the incident, which occurred the
night of Nov. 7, 1983.
   Friday's sentences from U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene
will run concurrently with a 60-year sentence Buck is serving on
other charges, prosecutors said.
   Repairs to the Capitol and art work displayed there cost
$250,000, the U.S. attorney's office said.
   Buck pleaded guilty Sept. 7 to charges she was involved in the
bombing and in plans to bomb other federal buildings. The remaining
co-defendants in the case, Linda Evans and Laura Whitehorn, still
are awaiting sentencing.
   A group calling itself the Armed Resistance Unit claimed
responsibility for the Capitol bombing, saying it was done in
response to U.S. military action in Grenada.
   The bomb was placed in a public corridor near the Senate
Republican Cloak Room and a few feet from the offices of Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who was then the majority leader. It was
detonated with a time-delay device.
   Prosecutors said an investigation revealed members of the group
also were involved in seven other bombings from 1983 to 1985 in the
Washington and New York areas.
   Authorities said Buck participated in a 1981 Brinks armored
truck robbery in Nyack, N.Y., in which four people were killed.

<TEXT>
   Three out of four Americans think President Bush
should get permission from Congress before launching an attack on
Iraq, according to national poll results reported Friday.
   The ABC News-Washington Post poll found 76 percent favored Bush
getting congressional approval, up from 69 percent early this
month.
   But other responses in the poll indicated support for Bush's
contention that he must be free to respond swiftly to any Iraqi
provocation. Fifty-two percent say either that Bush does not need
congressional approval or that they would back him if he didn't
have time to get it.
   The poll has been measuring public approval of Bush's response
to the Persian Gulf crisis since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
Support peaked at 78 percent in a Sept. 9 poll, fell to 65 percent
early this month and 59 percent in the current poll, conducted by
telephone Nov. 14 and 15.
   Bush's decision last week to send additional U.S. troops to the
gulf garnered 61 percent support. Fifty-two percent believe the
buildup makes war more likely, and 71 percent expect the United
States to get involved in a war with Iraq.
   The pollsters reported questioning 515 adult Americans in a
sampling that generally should produce results accurate to within 5
percentage points.

   President Bush got last-minute briefings on
the Persian Gulf crisis Friday before embarking on a weeklong
journey that will include a Thanksgiving visit with American forces
sent to the Middle East.
   Bush's first stop, early Saturday, was to be in Prague, to lay a
wreath commemorating the first anniversary of Czechoslovakia's turn
to democracy. The visit was the first ever by an American
president. Hundreds of thousands of people were expected to pack
into Wenceslas Square to hear him speak.
   After celebrating Czechoslovakia's ``Velvet Revolution,'' Bush
is scheduled to fly to Germany to meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl
before heading on to Paris. There, he'll be reunited with longtime
American allies in Europe - and former foes as well - in a
treaty-signing ceremony that will push the Cold War further into
the depths of history.
   Bush went jogging Friday as he prepared for the transatlantic
flight. He also wrapped up details on some domestic work, signed
some legislation and went over briefing materials for his eight-day
trip. A large part of the official talks during his travels will
center on the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
   The president left from Andrews Air Force Base near Washington
shortly before 7 p.m.
   The White House announced that congressional leaders - Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, House Speaker Thomas Foley, Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole and House Republican leader Robert
Michel - accepted Bush's invitation to join him in Saudi Arabia for
the holiday.
   Dole said the leaders will leave Washington Tuesday evening and
return Friday. ``I think it's a good indication,'' he said. ``It
sends a good signal, not only to the American people, but hopefully
to Saddam Hussein, that there is bipartisanship and politics does
stop at the water's edge.''
   Before he left, Bush wrote Foley and Senate President Pro Tem
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to announce formally his latest deployements.
``In my August 9 letter, I indictaed that I did not believe that
involvement in hostilities was imminent'' and that the buildup
would facilitate a ``peaceful resolution of the crisis.''
   ``My view on these matters has not changed,'' Bush wrote.
   The War Powers Act of 1973, which no president has accepted as
constitutional, requires notice of overseas deployments if
hostilities are imminent and mandates a withdrawl of troops if
Congress does not approve the action within 90 days. No one has
invoked the act in the Kuwait crisis, but congressional unease with
the prospect of war has been palpably rising recently.
   Bush flies from Paris to Saudi Arabia to spend Thanksgiving Day
with the troops he ordered to the Gulf region to stand against the
Iraqi army of President Saddam Hussein in the wake of the invasion
and takeover of Kuwait.
   Bush vowed Thursday that despite the massive buildup that will
put more than 400,000 U.S. troops in the region, he does not intend
to embark on a no-win war akin to Vietnam.
   ``I will not, as commander-in-chief, ever put somebody into a
military situation that we do not win - ever,'' he said in an
interview with CNN.
   ``And there's not going to be any long drawn-out agony of
Vietnam.''
   But Bush also said he could understand the public's growing
uneasiness with his military buildup ``because they are thinking,
we don't want to have a drawn-out Vietnam.''
   He said he wanted a strong U.S. offensive capability in the
Middle East to send a ``clear clarion signal to Saddam Hussein, we
are deadly serious'' about Iraq retreating from Kuwait, which it
invaded Aug. 2.
   During his trip, Bush will take the opportunity to discuss the
Persian Gulf problem with members of the 34-nation Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, including Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush has repeatedly touted the international solidarity against
Saddam and has rigorously solicited support from other countries
for the U.S. military buildup.
   He plans to sound out Britain, France and other CSCE
participants on the wording of a pending United Nations resolution
that would authorize use of military action to oust Iraq from
Kuwait.

<HEAD>Report: Iraq Believed to Have British-Made Superguns</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq is believed to possess three superguns that
are capable of firing artillery shells at targets up to 465 miles
away, according to a report Saturday in The Independent.
   The London newspaper said U.S. intelligence sources believe the
British-made guns may have been delivered to Iraq before the
supergun development program, known as Project 839, was uncovered
by British customs officers in April.
   It said it was not known if the guns were operational.
   The report noted that charges were dropped Thursday at Sheffield
Magistrates Court against two men charged with breaching Britain's
arms embargo against Iraq. Both had denied any knowledge of the
alleged gun.
   Reports had indicated the two men, businessman Peter Mitchell
and metallurgist Christopher Cowley, were linked to ballistics
expert Gerald Bull, who helped design the Iraqi supergun but was
shot to death outside a Brussels,. Belgium, apartment last March.
   British reports speculated Israeli agents may have killed Bull,
a Canadian who became a naturalized American citizen, to halt work
on the weapon. Bull reportedly was hired by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to develop a supergun capable of lobbing shells hundreds of
miles or launch satellites cheaply.
   The Independent said the ecision to drop charges against the
two men ``is understood to have been made at the highest level with
Cabinet knowledge.''
   It suggested that technical intelligence services in Britain and
the United States had been infuriated by the withholding of data
about the weapons system while the case was pending.
   ``Now that Britain and America face a possible war with Iraq,
the need to know the full capability of any superguns in Iraqi
hands has become pressing,'' the paper said.
   On April 12, British customs officers seized eight large
sections of steel tubing at Teesport dock in northeast England as
they were about to be shipped to Iraq.
   The Iraqi government and the manufacturer, Sheffield
Forgemasters of Rotherham in northern England, said the tubes were
intended for an Iraqi petrochemical plant.
   But military experts at that time said they believed the tubes
were destined to form the barrel of a huge Iraqi gun.
   The Independent reported Saturday, however: ``Further customs
investigations revealed that these tubes were not part of a gun but
were part of a ballistic test bed, designed to allow the Iraqis to
devise a cheap way of launching satellites by literally firing them
into space.
   ``However, it was later discovered that at the same time the
Iraqis had been taking delivery of other components which, customs
learned, were designed to be assembled into working artillery
pieces.''
   Turkish customs officers in April seized a 30-ton steel cylinder
from a Hungarian-registered truck heading for Iraq. British customs
officers said they thought this was also due to form part of an
Iraqi gun. Other suspected parts were seized in Greece and Italy.
   Cowley, 52, is a former associate of Bull, according to Press
Association, the British domestic news agency. Mitchell, 43, is
managing director of forgemasters Walter Somers Ltd., of Halesowen,
manufacturers of the pipe found in Turkey.
   Both had been charged with organizing illegal exports from
England.
   Press Association said Cowley acted as Bull's project
coordinator in contacts with Walter Somers.
   The Independent said Saturday that Cowley designed Project
Babylon, the experimental system seized at Teesport.

<HEAD>Hackers Sentenced in 911 Computer Break-in</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 20-year-old computer hacker was sentenced
Friday to a 21-month prison term on federal charges of breaking
into a nine-state 911 emergency network and passing access codes to
other hackers.
   Robert J. Riggs pleaded guilty with two other computer
enthusiasts. An indictment alleges they belonged to the ``Legion of
Doom,'' a tight-knit group of hackers who used computers to tap
into the 911 system and copy the program.
   Riggs, from Decatur, and Franklin E. Darden Jr., 23, of Norcross
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit computer and wire fraud,
among other charges.
   Darden and Adam E. Grant, 22, of Atlanta were sentenced to
14-month prison terms, seven of which can be served in a halfway
house.
   Grant pleaded guilty to possession of access codes with intent
to defraud.
   U.S. District Judge Owen Forrester ordered the three to serve
probation and perform community service after they serve their
prison time.
   Riggs was charged with breaking into the Atlanta-based BellSouth
Corp.'s 911 network covering Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina and
Florida.
   The hacking between September 1987 and July 1989 did not produce
a service disruption. The computer program was published in an
electronic newsletter.
   ``He was involved in a quest for knowledge,'' said Darden's
lawyer, Michael Hauptman. ``Frank was addicted to this world of
computer doors ... put before him.''
   Riggs was ordered to surrender to begin their sentences no
earlier than Feb. 15. Darden and Grant were told to report Jan. 4,
1991.

   President Bush, leaving tonight on an
eight-day trip to the Middle East and Europe, vows he will not
plunge the United States into a Vietnam-like war ``that we cannot
win'' in the Persian Gulf.
   ``There's not going to be any long drawn-out agony of Vietnam,''
Bush said Thursday in Cable News Network. He said
the reason he is sending 200,000 more troops to Saudi Arabia was to
demonstrate to Iraq's Saddam Hussein that ``we are deadly serious''
about demanding that he withdraw his troops from Kuwait aan interview on
nd free
all hostages.
   Bush also cautioned that Saddam is ``trying hard to get an
atomic weapon.'' And he said the world will have to insist on
international guarantees against further aggression by Iraq even if
it pulls out of Kuwait.
   The president's hard-line remarks signaled anew that he is not
in the mood to compromise with Baghdad over its invasion of Kuwait.
   On Thanksgiving Day, Bush will visit in the Saudi desert with
troops who may be ordered to fight Iraqi forces. He will be the
first U.S. president to visit front-line troops since Richard Nixon
in Vietnam in 1969.

<TEXT>
   Lita Belga hadn't heard from her
husband in months. When she learned he was killed in a car accident
in Saudi Arabia, she wept, and millions of other Filipinos wept
with her.
   Mrs. Belga received news of her husband Benjamin's death in a
telephone call to his Saudi employers, paid for and broadcast by
private radio station DZRH as part of its program ``Around The
World, With Love.''
   The program, in its seventh year, features telephone
conversations between Filipinos and relatives working abroad. It
has become a real-life soap opera, a daily litany of money
troubles, loneliness, death, and other family crises.
   Rey Langit, the host, said: ``The beauty of the program is the
spontaneity. ... It is true-to-life drama unfolding right before
you. It is both entertaining and educational.''
   Most people who appear on the show cannot afford to pay for
overseas calls themselves.
   ``You have not been sending money,'' Gloria Abalos said in a
recent call to her husband Ernesto in Saudi Arabia. ``I will kill
myself, that's what I'll do. ... I don't care how long you stay
there as long as you send us money.''
   With millions listening, relatives tried to muster the courage
to tell Boy Santos, also working in Saudi Arabia, that his
4-year-old daughter had died.
   None would admit the girl was dead, but Santos figured out what
they were trying to say.
   ``What have you done to my baby?'' he cried. ``You killed her!''
   Potential callers come to the DZRH studios every morning to sign
up. All except emergency cases are put on a waiting list two months
long.
   Langit said the station makes little profit from the program
because the calls are expensive. An average of six a day are made
during the two-hour program, broadcast six days a week.
   ``The program is both a commitment and moral obligation to give
good advice and help the poor with their problems,'' Langit said in
an interview.
   ``They say they do not have hope in the government. They
complain that government reaction is too slow and they come to us
pleading and telling us that we are their only hope.''
   Mrs. Belga turned to the station after being told by a Filipino
who returned from Saudi Arabia that her husband was dead. Neither
his employers nor the Philippine government had notified her.
   ``May I talk to my husband please?'' she asked the Saudi on the
other end of the line in Riyadh. ``Dead, dead'' he muttered in
Arabic. Eventually, another Filipino came to the telephone and
confirmed the death.
   Many conversations are embarassingly candid. In one, a jealous
husband in Saudi Arabia harangued his wife until Langit passed the
telephone to their young daughter.
   ``Why are you angry at mother?'' the girl asked. ``Mother now
has to wash clothes for other people just to feed us. She weeps day
and night.''
   After the daughter spoke, Langit scolded the husband about his
family responsibilities.
   ``The success of that call was that I was able to instruct the
guy to say `I love you' to his wife before he hung up,'' Langit
boasted.
   Some calls have happy results.
   A 14-year-old girl asked the station to help find her father,
who had abandoned his family and moved to the United States.
   ``We really wanted to help her, but how can we when the only
clue she had of his whereabouts was that he worked at a restaurant
in New York with huge glass panes in front?'' Langit said.
   Using a Manhattan hotel directory, the station began calling
until they found the father working as a bartender under an assumed
name.
   ``You don't know me, but I'm the child you abandoned,'' the girl
said as the nation listened. ``You never sent us money and that is
the reason why I have to sell flowers in the street and miss
school.''
   In a quivering voice, the father replied: ``It is my fault, my
daughter. But you must understand that if I did not remarry here, I
would not have survived.''
   The girl now lives in the United States with her father, Langit
said.

<HEAD>Austria May Become East-West Middleman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Austria, a neutral bridge between East
and West during four decades of Cold War, is in an ideal position
to be the middleman in a new age of political and economic
cooperation.
   It seems predestined to act as interpreter of both Eastern needs
and Western requirements for development.
   Herbert Krejci, general secretary of the conservative Federation
of Industrialists, said Austria could use its historical experience
to function as a ``transmission belt'' between the two halves of
Europe.
   Austria once was an empire encompassing Hungary, Czechoslovakia
and parts of Yugoslavia, Poland and Italy. Now it is a small
republic of 7.6 million at the crossroad between East and West,
with strong ties to both.
   Many Austrians have relatives in the East, or parents who grew
up there, but their country has established itself as a Western
democracy. It has a strong economy and applied in July 1989 for
membership in the 12-nation European Community.
   ``Membership in the EC is a logical consequence of our
geographic situation ... and the already existing strong economic
ties between Austria and the EC,'' said Heinz Fischer, a Socialist
Party legislator and speaker of Parliament.
   Krejci, a member of the conservative People's Party, said
Austria ``belongs to this Western community.''
   The Socialists are the senior partners in a coalition government
with the conservative People's Party.
   Fischer sees Austria as the mediator with Western Europe for
nations of the former Soviet bloc. ``However attractive the EC is
for Budapest and Prague,'' he said, ``Frankfurt, London and
Brussels will nevertheless be more foreign'' to them than Vienna.
   Jan Vit, a spokesman for the Czech regional government, was
quoted by the Austrian newspaper Die Presse as saying there was a
growing feeling of ``belonging together'' with Austria because of
the common history.
   A former Hungarian premier, Andras Hegedus, said recently his
country should seek its future in some form of alliance with other
nations of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire.
   Vienna has long been a center for East-West trade and is likely
to remain so.
   Poor facilities for communications and travel in Eastern Europe
make it difficult to conduct business efficiently. Telephone, rail
and road connections often are unreliable.
   IBM plans a computer information network connecting universities
in the East, but Vienna is the hub.
   A major question in Austria is whether it needs to continue a
neutral policy now that NATO and the Warsaw Pact no longer menace
each other.
   Austria became neutral by tacit agreement after the withdrawal
in 1955 of the occupying powers - the United States, Soviet Union,
France and Britain. That neutrality, and Austria's position on the
East-West divide, made it a logical meeting place for the two
sides.
   Vienna has been the site of East-West arms talks since 1970, a
two-year meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe was held in the Austrian capital and some U.N. agencies have
their headquarters here.
   An official policy of neutrality could create problems with
Austria's application for EC membership. Some EC officials have
said neutrality might affect common stands on security.
   Fischer, the Parliament speaker, cautions against writing off
neutrality just because East-West conflict appears to be over.
   ``One can't treat permanent neutrality like a share that one
immediately considers selling when the prices rise,'' he said.
   Many Austrians say the policy already had been redefined, when
the government gave permission for U.S. and British military planes
carrying troops and supplies to the Persian Gulf to use Austrian
airspace.
   Some feel the country must heed its past when reconsidering
neutrality.
   As an ally of Germany in 1914 and part of it after annexation by
Hitler in 1938, Austria was ``both initiator and accomplice in the
most horrible wars of human history,'' said Johannes Voggenhuber,
head of the Green-Alternative party.
   In the view of Krejci, the industrialist, EC membership could
offset the danger of overdependence on Germany, Austria's leading
trade partner.
   There was a surprising lack of emotional reaction to German
unification in Austria, and state television did not provide
extended live coverage of the event. The lack of emotion appeared
to reflect Austria's sense of its own independent identity since
World War II.
   Krejci explained the seeming indifference with a quote from
former Chancellor Julius Raab:
   ``German is our mother tongue, but Austria is our mother
country.''

<HEAD>Thanksgiving Turkey Arrives Early on NBC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's easy to tell when a TV movie is written in
Los Angeles. At times of crisis, the characters say things like,
``I can't believe this is happening!'' Or, ``This isn't
happening!''
   Indeed, in ``Thanksgiving Day,'' airing tonight on NBC, Mary
Tyler Moore plays a freshly minted widow who gets grossed out by
her oldest son's tasteless eulogy and mutters: ``Is this really
happening?''
   It is. It is part of what NBC calls an ``offbeat'' black comedy
in which Max Schloss (Tony Curtis), a wealthy maker of industrial
gloves in Detroit, dies at Thanksgiving dinner, his head falling
into the turkey he's carving.
   This causes hunger, mourning and later crises that include
veteran TV yeller Morton Downey Jr., briefly loose as a lech who is
hot for Max's widow (Moore). He vomits into the bushes not once but
twice when she says no dice.
   That is offbeat. But look at it this way: The script is by Steve
Zacharias and Jeff Buhai, whose previous biggie was ``Revenge of
the Nerds.''
   On the bright side, the show includes a cameo appearance by
Sonny Bono, who once sang half of ``I Got You, Babe.''
   And it's actually fitfully funny.
   This is largely because of the valiantly deft direction by Gino
Tanasescu and wonderful comic turns, first by Curtis in his
too-brief stay, then by Joe Bologna as Ned Monk, a ruthless
billionaire once engaged to the widow Schloss.
   And the show does get off to a good start. Its initial scenes
have the sly, sardonic tone of a traditional Midwestern family
reunion on Thanksgiving engineered by the maestro of Americana,
Jean Shepherd.
   Alas, it starts sputtering after Max dies in midcarve and his
industrial-glove empire is turned over to Randy (Jonathon
Brandmeier), his divorced, womanizing, happy-go-lucky slob of an
older son.
   The authors try to keep things lively. Randy, who has his two
kids with him, still fights with his sister (Curtis' daughter,
Kelly), just like old times. Only now she's a lesbian activist
with, gasp, a lover.
   And there's a second Schloss son (try saying that rapidly),
played by Andy Hirsh. His character, Michael, just watches TV.
Well, that might be considered lively in Hollywood.
   Moving right along now, Randy, whose inherited business is
rapidly going poof, would be very happy for the wealthy Monk to
marry his mother. He even says: ``You ought to go out with my mom,
Ned. ... She's got a great body.''
   Little does he know that the evil mogul, still in love with the
widow Schloss after 30 years, will resort to crushing the family's
glove empire.
   The idea is to drive her into his arms to save her family (she
broke off their first engagement due to what you might call a
mother's love).
   All this unfolds with the aid of strained writing, one spoken
crudity that would have had NBC censors shouting ``BINGO!'' in
their glory days, and an inspiring moment when the sister threatens
to drool on Randy's face.
   The fine silly bits scattered about usually go to Bologna.
During a banquet honoring Ned for his aid to the homeless, for
example, Ned declares himself pleased to give them ``a taste of
what they need - nouvelle cuisine.''
   Another worthy scene: Ned, wooing the widow, does it with a
string quartet and serenades her by playing Mozart - on the
bassoon.
   But the good times are frittered away by such things as a silly
South Seas musical fantasy number involving Moore, or the family
butler posing this question to another of Randy's sweeties, a
dental hygienist:
   ``I've been flossing my teeth for three years, now. But let me
ask you: Is it all right to eat the little food particles once you
get 'em out from between your teeth?''
   Too bad. NBC should have had the script tuned up by an old pro.
An old pro is someone who knows that too much Truly Tasteless humor
usually means the authors are film school students who graduated
magna cum ``Porky's.''
   ---
   Elsewhere in television ...
   THE SIMPSONS GET DOWN: Responding to public demand, maybe, the
best-known of Fox's ``The Simpsons'' will make his singing debut
Tuesday, when Geffen Records releases ``Do the Bartman.'' It's a
single, part of the long-awaited ``The Simpsons Sing the Blues''
album that will be released on Dec. 6. At that time, Fox also will
air a ``Do the Bartman'' music video - it runs just over five
minutes - at the end of ``The Simpsons.''

<HEAD>Hope and Fear Mix in Trade Deal With United States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a country where hawkers sell Coca-Cola
beside monuments to martyrs of U.S. invasions, plans for a
free-trade agreement with Mexico's powerful northern neighbor rouse
both hope and dread.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari says free trade and a
liberalized economy will help Mexico ``become a part of the first,
not the Third World.''
   He and President Bush are to meet in Monterrey, Mexico, on Nov.
27 to advance their plans for free trade. Formal negotiations are
to start in the first half of 1991 and could be finished in two
years.
   Mexican businessmen are eager to sell in a market 40 times
larger than their own, but fear greater competition from richer
American rivals.
   Labor leaders see a chance for new jobs and a risk of losing old
ones.
   Intellectuals look upon free tradeas part of a reform pattern
that is transforming Mexico, turning it from government control to
a freer market.
   A country that has struggled for decades to remain apart from
the colossus across the Rio Grande now is on the verge of embracing
it.
   ``We are at the end of the Mexican Revolution ... or at least we
are at the end of the identity of the national state with Mexican
Revolution,'' said Francisco Valdes, a political scientist.
   Canada may join the talks, which could lead to a North American
free-trade zone of 350 million people.
   For decades, Mexican industry hid behind high tariff walls that
made legally imported goods unavailable or extremely expensive. The
resulting lack of competition often led to inefficient local
companies producing shoddy goods.
   Opening the gates to better and cheaper products from the north
has some managements wondering if they can survive. The Mexican
decision to join the tariff-lowering General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade exposed some industries to serious foreign cometition for
the first time.
   Businessmen like Viktor Miklis, president of the National
Chamber of the Clothing Industry, are excited by access to the U.S.
market.
   He told journalists imports had captured 30 percent of the
domestic market because of tariff cuts but that Mexico could vastly
increase exports to the United States, which now gets less than 3
percent of its imported clothing from this country.
   ``These new treaties ... just as they could be very beneficial,
they could be damaging if we don't think about them and if we are
not prepared,'' he said.
   His organization and other groups opened a Design and Style
Center this year to help Mexican companies track international
fashions they once could ignore, and to offer computerized design
and cutting services.
   ``This is state of the art,'' said the center's technical
director, Robert Demmer, who returned to Mexico from the New York
City garment district to help run the center. ``You can't find
anything better than this.''
   He showed off U.S.-made computer terminals that plot clothing
designs and patterns, and guide a machine that slices through 50 to
200 pieces of fabric at a time.
   Miklis and Demmer say they hope such know-how will help keep
Mexico from being a sweatshop that assembles imported parts in
foreign-owned factories.
   If Mexican businessmen can't keep up, ``you'll have Japanese
people coming in here and setting up a plant with their own manager
and methods, and we're going to be cleaning and sweeping and doing
the crappy work once again,'' Demmer said.
   ``Mexicans don't want to be in the trade agreement only because
of cheap labor.''
   Mexico's minimum wage of $3.40 to $4.10 a day, depending on the
area, lures many foreign investors. Most business leaders and
economists say, however, that free trade should push wages up by
creating competition for more skilled and productive workers.
   In his annual State of the Nation speech this month, Salinas
said Mexico would suffer ``stagnation, technological backwardness,
social tension and finally national weakness - in other words,
effective loss of sovereignty'' if it did not join the world
economy.
   Mexico City newspapers carry daily stories about the trade
agreement even though no details are known. Many critics express
fear that Mexico will swap its independence for foreign investment.
   ``We are removing all of our traditional outlooks ... to arrive
at a national surrender, which is the plan for negotiating a
free-trade treaty,'' political scientist Alfonso Aguilar said at a
seminar on global political change.
   Valdes, a researcher at the National Autonomous University of
Mexico, said increased integration of the U.S. and Mexican
economies is inevitable, but ``the problem is how it is
negotiated.''
   He complained that little information about the forthcoming
treaty was available, and said Mexico has a poor record of
negotiating.
   Mexico is bargaining from weakness, Valdes said, and ``the
United States has a tendency to take advantage of the weak.''
   Many Mexicans say U.S. companies already operating in Mexico
ignore safety and environmental standards they would have to meet
in the United States.
   ``What Mexico is selling, perversely, is a country without
regulations,'' Aguilar said, but added that a free-trade agreement
treaty would pressure business to meet U.S. standards.
   Noting that Mexico's prosperity and stability is important to
the United States, Miklis gave U.S. companies a message: ``Join us,
don't use us.''

<HEAD>Airline Near Misses, Claims Against Drexel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   They could have become statistics in the
predicted shakeout of the nation's airline industry, but Eastern
Airlines and Pan Am Corp. are still here.
   For the time being anyway.
   The two carriers, among the weakest in an industry burdened by
rising fuel costs, signed new leases on life this past week - one
in bankruptcy court, the other in the boardroom.
   Both deals went down within minutes of each other late Wednesday
night.
   Eastern, operating under bankruptcy court supervision, persuaded
Judge Burton R. Lifland to release cash from an escrow account and
reject a creditors' request to liquidate the airline.
   Pan Am, weighed down by heavy operating losses, completed the
sale of trans-Atlantic routes to stronger rival UAL Corp. that will
bring in $400 million and set the stage for joint marketing efforts
by the two carriers.
   Rejuvenation was far from assured in either case. Eastern only
got half of a requested $30 million from the escrow account and
could hit another financial flash point within weeks. Pan Am,
meanwhile, must develop a plan for succeeding as a smaller carrier.
It hinted at a worst case scenario Thursday, announcing that in the
unlikely event it stopped flying, UAL would honor up to $100
million of Pan Am tickets.
   Both Eastern and Pan Am faced a tough climb against the same
economic conditions that drove them to their separate fates. Fuel
prices have risen relentlessly since the Persian Gulf crisis began
in August, and air travel has become a victim of the nationwide
economic downturn.
   Observers were most skeptical of Eastern's chances, since it is
trying to rebuild its customer base by attracting first-class
business at coach fares. Creditors of the airline argued that
strategy was hopeless.
   Eastern trustee Martin R. Shugrue Jr., who has been running the
airline since Frank Lorenzo was ousted in April, was unbowed by the
challenge, although he had to admit Eastern's reputation was
damaged by the creditors' push for liquidation.
   ``Their actions in public and in the media are nothing short of
reckless and shameful,'' he said after the bankruptcy court ordeal.
   The nine-hour bankruptcy hearing Wednesday had attracted legions
of reporters, photographers and television film crews who had put
the Eastern story on the back burner the past few months.

<HEAD>CRIME BEAT: Drexel Faces Huge Claims, Milken Begs for Mercy</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In another bankruptcy drama, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was hit
with billions of dollars worth of claims from the government and
private investors allegedly defrauded by the investment firm.
   The biggest bombshell hit Wednesday when government thrift
regulators filed claims seeking $11.3 billion. Total claims from
all those who say they were defrauded could approach $30 billion,
far more than what's left to be doled out by Drexel in its Chapter
11 reorganization.
   Lawyers are negotiating how much Drexel will set aside to pay
all the claims. It only has about $3 billion in assets, plus
various investments, and a long list of other creditors waiting to
be paid.
   Most fraud claims are related to Drexel's 1989 guilty plea to
six felony counts of illegal trading. The thrift regulators laid
some of the blame for the &amp;L crisis at Drexel's door, alleging
that the firm ran a corrupt junk-bond network that helped ruin
dozens of savings and loans.
   Drexel's junk-bond ace, Michael Milken, facing a criminal
sentencing in federal district court Wednesday, asked Judge Kimba
Wood to show him mercy. In an 11-page letter to the judge, Milken
admitted he broke the law but said he feared prison and hoped to be
sentenced to community service.
   In one revealing passage from the letter, he told the judge of
his emotional reaction to the motion picture ``Field of Dreams,''
in which an Iowa farmer has a mystical reunion with his dead
father, who returns to play baseball on a diamond the farmer has
hewn from a cornfield.
   ``I found myself wondering what I would be saying to my father
if he was alive today?'' Milken wrote.
   In a signal of what could be in store for Milken, Judge Miriam
Cedarbaum gave John A. Mulheren Jr. a year's worth of prison time
and a $1.68 million fine on a stock manipulation conviction. The
judge said the former friend of Wall Street felon Ivan Boesky
deserved jail because he tampered with ``the integrity of the stock
market.''

<HEAD>PEOPLE: Trump Faces the Music, Icahn Stirring</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump was pressured by his junk bondholders to put the
``eighth wonder of the world'' - the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic
City - into bankruptcy after his missed a deadline for a $47.3
million interest payment.
   But the so-called ``prepackaged'' bankruptcy would theoretically
last only a matter of weeks while Trump and the bondholders work
out a new payment schedule on $675 million worth of junk.
   Trump put a positive spin on the episode, but it erected still
another hurdle for the developer-casino baron, who has junk bonds
outstanding on all three of his gaming establishments and owes $2
billion to banks.
   One of Trump's interested bondholders was investor Carl Icahn,
whose influence in the negotiations with Trump was hard to measure.
But Icahn was making news on two other fronts, with a bid to buy
Pan Am and fresh demands for USX Corp.
   The Pan Am idea fizzled quickly, since it was only a backup for
the ultimately successful deal between Pan Am and UAL. But USX
faced continuing pressure from Icahn, who is the energy and steel
company's biggest shareholder.
   In a letter to USX chairman Charles Corry, Icahn praised the
company's plans to transfer its steel operations to a separate
subsidiary, but he reiterated his threat to seek seats on the board
unless USX pursued a major restructuring. Icahn would like to see
the steel business sold off and the proceeds distributed to
shareholders.
   Elsewhere, Dallas investor Harold Simmons was stirring, updating
a play for defense giant Lockheed Corp. Simmons, rebuffed in a
previous attempt to increase his 20 percent stake in the company,
offered to take it private in a $2 billion deal if Lockheed put up
half the cash. The company responded cautiously and market reaction
was lukewarm.

<HEAD>ECONOMY: Inflation Numbers Encouraging</HEAD>

   The latest batch of inflation numbers from the government were
high, but nevertheless encouraging.
   Overall, consumer prices were up 0.6 percent in October,
following jumps of 0.8 percent in each of the previous two months.
But analysts pointed out that the core rate of inflation - minus
products related to oil - was a more moderate 0.3 percent.

<HEAD>Profit Picture Keeps Getting Bleaker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For stock-market investors looking for relief
from a steady barrage of recession news, the picture presented by
corporate profits offers scant encouragement right now.
   More than a year after earnings at many businesses started to
slump, Wall Street analysts are still busy cutting their profit
estimates for 1990, and 1991 as well.
   The stock market, meanwhile, has been demonstrating that it is
still vulnerable to disappointments on the bottom line.
   The latest gloomy message came via long-distance telephone, when
MCI Communications, one of the stalwarts of the over-the-counter
market, announced a restructuring plan.
   The company said the costs of the changes it would be making,
plus intense competition, loomed as a drag on earnings ``for the
next several quarters.''
   The ensuing selling pressure on MCI spread to stocks of other
companies in the long-distance phone business - including American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, with its 2.5 million-plus shareholders, and
United Telecommunications and GTE, the two owners of U.S. Sprint
Communications.
   AT&amp;T's assertion that its long-distance business remained strong
did little to calm investors.
   The MCI problem, of course, concerned a specific company in a
specific business. But it also echoed a broader theme.
   ``The outlook for corporate profits is dismal,'' said Suresh
Bhirud at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in his latest appraisal of the
stock-market outlook.
   ``Technical rallies notwithstanding, the fundamentals remain
largely negative for the stock market. In our opinion, even at
current levels the market is still somewhat overvalued.''
   With most of the figures in for the quarter that ended Sept. 30,
Melissa Brown at Prudential-Bache Securities calculated that
overall corporate profits were down about 5.3 percent from the
third quarter of 1989.
   ``The results are particularly disturbing when one recalls that
the third quarter of 1989 was a weak quarter for many industries,''
she said.
   That left the Street with no sign of break in a lengthening
trend. ``Profits have been falling sharply but not steadily since
the end of 1988,'' noted the economists David Levy and S. Jay Levy
in their advisory letter Industry Forecast.
   ``They will slide in the current quarter and continue to fall in
the first half of 1991.''
   But with all the short-term pain that goes with this, Wall
Street's optimists still see prospects for longer-term gain.
Historically, they point out, down cycles in the stock market
reverse well before corporate profits bottom out.
   This kind of willingness to ``look across the valley'' was
evident in the stock market during the past week. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials climbed 61.64 points to 2,550.25.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index chimed in with a
2.13 gain at 173.30; the NASDAQ composite index for the
over-the-counter market rose 8.90 to 350.85, and the American Stock
Exchange market value index was up 6.49 at 297.52.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 163.55 million shares a day, up
from 147.70 million the week before.
   ``To our mind, the investment outlook is improving,'' maintains
Michael Sherman at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   ``We believe that interest rates, both short and long, are
ultimately going to be sharply lower,'' he said.
   ``The decade-long credit expansion that was spawned by excesses
in leveraged buyouts, junk bonds and huge overinvestments in
commercial real estate has come to an end.
   ``In its wake will be sharply reduced credit demand and sharply
lower interest rates as savers push their funds toward existing
financial assets.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Business inventories grew 0.5 percent in
September, the government said, leading some analysts to express
concern the buildup could lead to further production cuts and loss
of jobs.
   Economist Evelina Tainer of the First National Bank of Chicago
noted Thursday that industrial production in October already
dropped 0.8 percent, its sharpest cutback in nine months. ``It's
consistent with the idea that the economy is sliding into a
recession and growth will be negative in the fourth quarter,'' she
said.

   The official, who spoke Thursday on the condition his name not
be used, said the cuts being considered would reduce benefits for
affluent recipients with the savings used to provide tax cuts to

   Such an action ``is clearly being contemplated very seriously,''
said the official, who also stressed that all planning for the new
budget was in a very preliminary stage with final decisions a long
way from being made.

<TEXT>
   The 1980s were a decade of expansion on Wall
Street. The 1990s promise to be just the opposite.
   Moody's Investors Service said in its annual report on the
securities industry that Wall Street faces weak profits and more
consolidation through the end of the century as bad times erase
happy memories of a decade of growth.
   Big companies will continue to take over and bail out weakening
securities firms, but some nonetheless will go under, Moody's said.
Competition will increase as banks push into the industry and
foreign firms threaten U.S. turf.
   Firms across the board face cost-cutting pressures, Moody's
said. Likely targets for reductions are reducing the ballooned
compensation of the 1980s, eliminating whole businesses and exiting
from unprofitable foreign markets.
   ``The 1980s goal of becoming a global player in a broad range of
products is fading for many firms,'' Moody's said in its report,
released Thursday. ``Managements are refocusing on core business in
which they can build sustainable competitive advantages.''
   Moody's said Wall Street firms' overhead expenses at the end of
1989 quadrupled from their 1980 level to $57.7 billion. The
companies' aggregate pretax earnings last year were $1.8 billion,
slightly lower than in 1980.
   The industry has struggled since the October 1987 stock market
crash. More than 45,000 jobs have been erased and the key business
lines of investment banking, leveraged buyouts, and mergers and
acquisitions have nosedived.
   ``The outlook now is that those three areas will be much, much
smaller and in some cases nonexistent,'' said Moody's vice
president Christopher Mahoney, who helped prepare the report.
   ``The Street was subsidizing a lot of growth domestically and
internationally from lucrative businesses that are drying up or
diminishing,'' he said.
   Moody's predicted further consolidation leading to domination by
firms created through acquisition by wealthy companies.
``Ultimately there may be few, if any, large independent Wall
Street securities firms,'' the report said.
   The report said that overcapacity in the industry ``will take
years to reduce, and will put fundamental downward pressure on
securities firms' returns.''
   The power of diversified, strong owners has been a theme of the
industry's woes this year, in which several major securities firms
have been bailed out of severe financial difficulty by
deep-pocketed parents.
   Most recently, CS First Boston Inc. this week received a $300
million equity infusion from its Swiss parent, CS Holding, which
took majority control of the investment banking firm. CS First
Boston's main U.S. subsidiary is First Boston Corp.
   Mahoney said a problem with the trend is that the survival of
the fittest is thrown on its head. Wall Street's failed firms used
to be acquired by the successful ones.
   ``One impediment to that now is that a lot of weak firms are
owned by strong parents, so they don't die a natural death,''
Mahoney said. ``They're not absorbed by strong firms; they're
maintained as independent entities.''
   The Moody's report said intense competition, continued
overcapacity and the decline in major business segments mean weak
prospects for profitability on Wall Street through the end of the
century.
   ``Additional risks are the temptation for managements to ease
profit pressure by taking greater risks, and the likelihood of more
aggressive involvement in U.S. and overseas securities markets by
powerful foreign securities firms and banks,'' Moody's said.
   The report also cited a recent erosion of the Depression-era
Glass-Steagall Act that prevented commercial banks from entering
the securities industry.
   It said several U.S. bank-holding companies, including J.P.
Morgan, Citicorp and Bankers Trust, ``are eager to expand further
into the securities business, and they pose important competitive
threats to U.S. securities firms.''
   A similar trend is occurring in Japan, Moody's said, increasing
the challenge to U.S. firms' core businesses and markets.

   Government regulators for the first time have
laid much of the blame for the savings and loan industry collapse
on the junk bond dealings of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   In a 60-page legal claim, federal thrift regulators accuse the
failed investment firm of bribery, fraud, market manipulation and
other serious crimes they allege hastened the demise of 48 savings
and loan institutions.
   The claim, which seeks $11.3 billion on behalf the thrifts, was
released Thursday. A federal bankruptcy judge denied the government
more time to investigate Drexel's junk bond dealings with other
savings and loans.
   Sackfuls of claims by investors, companies, former employees and
other parties against Drexel arrived at U.S. Bankruptcy Court to
meet a Thursday deadline. Lawyers said total litigation claims
would exceed $20 billion.
   Drexel has only about $3 billion in assets, plus a portfolio of
investments, which won't come close to meeting the legal claims and
those of secured creditors, those who definitely are entitled to
money in the bankruptcy case.
   Attorneys for Drexel, investors and the government agencies are
negotiating to establish an estimate of how much the firm will set
aside to pay the litigation claims. That figure would have to be
approved by a federal judge.
   The charges by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and
Resolution Trust Corp. are the most detailed yet by the government
in the S&amp;L collapse, which is expected to cost taxpayers $500
billion over the next 30 years.
   Thrift industry analysts said that without judging whether
Drexel broke the law, blaming the firm for the industry's failure
was excessive. Drexel managed most of the $15 billion in high-risk,
high-yield bonds bought by thrifts in the 1980s.
   ``The fact is junk bonds played a very small role overall, but
it's an area the S&amp;Ls shouldn't have been in at all in the first
place,'' said Kenneth H. Thomas, a Miami consultant who has studied
the portfolios of failed thrifts. Thomas estimates that total
thrift junk bond losses could hit $7 billion.
   Drexel controlled a network of thrifts that invested billions of
dollars of federally insured money in the securities, some of it
swapped among the S&amp;Ls. When the market collapsed a year ago, much
of the holdings was wiped out.
   The sweeping allegations describe a market rigged by Drexel in
concert with thrift executives. The FDIC and RTC allege Drexel gave
the junk market the appearance of liquidity by fixing prices,
mandating who would buy which securities and providing investment
opportunities to favored customers.
   Thrift executives were induced to buy and sell the bonds at
Drexel's behest, ``to share in the plunder of their own
institutions and to obtain other benefits - including assistance in
evading regulatory discipline of their S&amp;L,'' the agencies said.
   Other thrifts were victims of alleged fraud and conspiracy, the
agencies claim. The firm and its co-conspirators also ran an
``extensive propaganda campaign'' to mislead the public about junk
bonds, the filing states.
   The allegations are likely to be challenged in court, and
several creditors and outside observers complained that the
government - which was responsible for regulating the savings and
loans - was ignoring its own role in the thrift debacle.
   ``The FDIC monitored the operations of all these thrifts while
they were in business and did not take any steps to stop it while
the actual conduct was going on,'' said Barry Dichter, attorney for
one of Drexel's largest creditors.
   Nonetheless, the FDIC and RTC detail alleged securities price
manipulation, secret ``parking'' arrangements, bogus transactions,
payoffs, loans among members of the junk network and rampant
violation of federal disclosure laws.
   In total, the agencies seek $6.8 billion in damages for junk
bond and other frauds. They also want another $4.5 billion on
behalf of Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association of Beverly Hills,
Calif., which has not yet been taken over by the government.
   Among the allegations:
   -Drexel helped CenTrust Bank Chairman David Paul skirt Florida
laws by falsifying records about the thrift's purchase of more than
$1 billion in securities. Paul also is accused of illegally holding
millions of shares of securities for Drexel.
   -Drexel, through a series of investments with associates, helped
install a new management of Imperial Savings Association of San
Diego, which then became a major purchaser of Drexel-issued junk
bonds. Imperial in one year increased its junk bond investments
from $1 million to $1 billion. The thrift has lost $56 million on
sales of Drexel junk bonds.
   -Drexel enabled now-indicted financier Charles Keating to gain
control of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.,
and gave him stock kickbacks in exchange for huge Linoln
investments in Drexel-underwritten junk bonds, some in major
takeover deals of the 1980s.

   United Airlines' parent company has agreed to
honor up to $100 million of Pan Am Corp.'s tickets at face value if
the troubled airline should stop flying.
   Cash-strapped Pan Am insisted it was not trying to signal any
pending problems. Pan Am said that the unusual guarantee was being
offered in an effort to calm any fears that the current sluggish
economy could leave anyone holding worthless tickets.
   ``We recognize that our financial condition has been weakened
and certainly the current fuel situation is having a negative
impact on the company's finances,'' Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela
Hanlon said Thursday. Hanlon was unaware of any similar guarantees
ever taking place in the air travel industry.
   The arrangement is part of a marketing agreement struck by the
rival carriers in a $400 million deal that gives United Airlines
five coveted London routes that had been some of the most prized
possessions of Pan Am. In the marketing pact, the two carriers also
agreed to coordinate some flights in an effort to feed passengers
to one another.
   Pan Am and UAL signed the deal late Wednesday night after first
announcing it in October. UAL is also getting additional routes;
Pan Am's facilities at San Francisco International Airport,
Washington's Dulles Airport and London's Heathrow Airport; two
Boeing 747s; two spare engines; and spare parts.
   In a statement outlining the details, Pan Am said Thursday
evening that ``United will redeem up to $100 million face value of
Pan Am tickets for travel on United if Pan Am were to cease its air
transportation operations.''
   Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett said, ``The customer
protection guarantee program is yet another demonstration of Pan
Am's and United's commitment to the traveling public.''
   Hanlon said the ticket guarantee ``isn't intended to raise
suggestions that we would stop flying. But it should certainly
alleviate any travel agency or consumer fears that travelers would
be left with worthless tickets if indeed the carrier ever did stop
flying. There is certainly no plan or intention to stop
operations.''
   Pan Am was merely trying to calm any travelers who are concerned
about the overall health of the air travel industry, which has been
rocked by soaring fuel prices and the sluggish U.S. economy.
Industry executives predict the airlines will lose up to $2 billion
in 1990.
   Asked for the face value of Pan Am's tickets that are currently
outstanding, Hanlon said those figures are not made public.
   United issued a statement on the marketing agreement that said
it will ``honor up to $100 million in Pan Am tickets should the
carrier cease operation.''

   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed
3.3 percent to $9.4 billion in September, the first improvement
since June, the government reported today. But petroleum imports
were at their highest level in nine years because of escalating
costs due to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The Commerce Department said imports dropped 2.4 percent to
$41.3 billion despite a huge 28.5 percent jump in petroleum
imports. But exports also fell, down 2.2 percent to $31.8 billion.
The deficit is the difference between the two.
   The cost of imported oil rose to $6.2 billion as the price per
barrel shot ahead 24.4 percent to $24.31. Volume increased 6.7
percent to 8.5 million barrels a day. It was the largest oil bill
since October 1981 when it rose to $6.3 billion. The price per
barrel then was $32.50.
   The September deficit pushed the gap to a seasonally adjusted
rate of $99.1 billion for the first nine months of the year. The
deficit peaked at $152 billion in 1987 and the fell to $118.53
billion in 1988 and to $109.40 billion last year.
   Before the Persian Gulf crisis pumped up oil prices, government
officials and economists believed the gap would fall below $100
billion for the first time since 1983.
   Bush administration officials still view exports as one of the
few nets available to keep the economy from falling into - or too
far into - a recession.
   It has accounted in recent years for a third of the nation's
economic growth. Consumer spending, the other two-thirds, has been
fading recently in the face of adverse economic news acerbated by
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Some officials hope that a weaker dollar will help prop up
exports by making U.S. products less expensive overseas. At the
same time, they say, a cheaper dollar will make imports more
expensive and thus less attractive to Americans.
   Excluding oil products, the deficit totaled $3.8 billion, down
$1.2 billion from the August non-oil gap. The government contends
this is a better measure of the nation's overseas competitiveness.
   The price of oil was driven up when Iraq stormed Kuwait on Aug.
2 and disrupted world markets. In the month that followed, the cost
of oil imports jumped 20.9 percent to $4.8 billion although volume
also dropped.
   Economist Michael P. Niemira of the Mitsubishi Bank in New York
said in advance of the report that the Persian Gulf crisis also had
an effect on exports.
   ``Exports transported by air during September again were
disrupted by the military operation in the Middle East'' when some
domestic air cargo companies that usually haul shipments overseas
were diverted to transport military goods, he wrote in the bank's
Weekly Economic Indicator Report.
   Imports of foreign-made cars declined 4.2 percent in September.
Imports of capital goods and consumer goods also fell, while
industrial supplies increased.
   The decline in exports was widespread except for capital goods,
which rose fractionally.
   The biggest deficit continued to be with Japan - a $3.05 billion
imbalance, down from $3.78 billion in August.
   Other deficits included Taiwan, $1.03 billion; China $1.07
billion; Canada, $1.25 billion; South Korea, $406 million; Hong
Kong, $231 million; and Brazil, $105 million.
   The United States posted a $882 million surplus in its trade
with Western Europe after a $374 million imbalance a month earlier.

<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp., the nation's
second-largest long-distance telephone company, cited weak economic
conditions and increased competition in announcing that it may lay
off as many as 1,500 workers over the next six months.
   Company officials said it was too early to say where the layoffs
would occur.
   According to plans announced Thursday, MCI will fold its seven
domestic divisions into four and create two new units to deal with
network services and consumer markets.
   President Bert C. Roberts Jr. said the slowing economy, the
costs of changing the company's structure and the costs of a recent
$1.25 billion acquisition ``are negative constraints on the
company's financial performance for the next several quarters.''
   MCI, based in Washington, has seen its expansion slow to a crawl
as market leader American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has moved to
recapture market share.
   The expansion of the long-distance market has also faltered
because of the economic downturn.
   Roberts said if current trends continue, MCI's revenue growth
would ``flat'' for the quarter, compared to the previous quarter.
   Analyst Geoff Johnson, with Argus Research of New York, said
long-distance calling has slowed significantly because customers
are cutting back on the number and length of calls. He said the
trend was expected to continue.
   MCI spokesman Bernard Goodrich called the 1,500 job losses
``really kind of slim'' given that the company has about 25,000
workers.
   MCI had revenues in 1989 of $6.5 billion.
   In July, the Federal Communications Commission approved MCI's
merger with Telecom USA Inc., the fourth largest U.S. long distance
company.

   The stock market advanced early today,
encouraged by government reports showing that inflation, excluding
food and energy prices, moderated in October.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 9.41 at 2,554.46
in the first half hour of trading.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23 million shares as of 10 a.m.
on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 3 to 1 with
712 issues up, 289 down and 409 unchanged.
   The Labor Department said that the nation's core inflation rate,
which excludes volatile food and energy prices, advanced a moderate
0.3 percent last month.
   The report supported stock prices and made for a firm opening,
said Michael Metz, a vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   The Consumer Price Index ``was definitely encouraging,'' he
said. ``It suggests that if you subtract oil, inflationary
pressures are easing.'' The report pushed bond prices higher -
moving interest rates lower in tandem - and that helped the stock
market, Metz said.
   Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the nation's
trade deficit narrowed 3.3 percent in September, the first
improvement since June.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, IBM was up &rsqb; at 113;
Ford was off } at 27{; AT&amp;T lost ~ at 32\, and International Paper

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.71 at 173.83. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index gained 0.28 to 296.97.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 14.60 to
2,545.05.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 593 up, 899 down and 478 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 151.37 million shares, against 179.31

   A strike by floor traders protesting a
proposed capital gains tax halted stock trading in Italy on Friday.
   Picket lines went up outside the Milan exchange, Italy's
largest, and trading was also blocked in Rome and the other small
stock exchanges in the country.
   The union said the strike will continue until at least
Wednesday, when the Finance Commitee of the Chamber of Deputies has
agreed to hear their grievances.
   The traders say the proposed 30 percent tax on capital gains
will discourage investors. They also charge that the government has
been slow in implementing long-pending legislation aimed at
modernizing the bourse in order to keep it competitive with other
international stock markets.

<TEXT>
   General Dynamics' Electronics division plans to
cut the unit's union-represented work force by up to 15 percent in
January, labor officials said.
   General Dynamics also said it will lay off 61 Convair
machinists, effective Jan. 12, and has notified labor
representatives that more of the division's employees may be laid
off after the first of the year.
   The company told the International Association of Machinists -
which represents almost 6,000 workers at the company's San Diego
divisions - in a letter earlier this month that the Electronics
division employees would be laid off effective Jan. 28, IAM
District Lodge 50 president Ed Maudlin said Thursday.
   Company spokesman Jack Isabel acknowledged that ``it is possible
that we will make staff adjustments before the end of the year.''
   ``If there is a work adjustment, notices will be given after
Thanksgiving and will be effective after the holidays,'' Isabel
said.
   However, he declined to comment on the number of workers who
could be lad off, or the divisions that would be affected. The San
Diego divisions employ 17,900 people.
   The announcement comes as aerospace firms from San Diego to
Seattle are paring payrolls in an effort to blunt the effects of
defense cutbacks.
   Union officials said a 15 percent reduction in the Electronics
division would put about 120 machinists out of work. Approximately
800 of the unit's 2,900 employees are represented by IAM.
   ``There aren't too many jobs out there right now,'' Maudlin
said. ``The picture really isn't that bright.''
   The layoff notice came less than four months after General
Dynamics reported a $240 million loss due to cost overruns on
contracts to build the A-12 navy bomber and field radios for the
Army.
   The two programs resulted in a $500 million one-time charge
against second-quarter earnings, the largest in company history.
   The Electronics division, which was awarded the Army radio
contract two years ago, opened a new facility in Tallahassee, Fla.
to manufacture 265,000 of the hand-held devices.
   However, company officials said production of the Single Channel
Ground and Airborne Radio System was more complex than anticipated,
resulting in the overrun.

   President Bush's signing of a toughened clean
air law begins a new era in the fight to rid the country of its
dirtiest air, but it will still take years to produce noticeably
clearer skies.
   ``Every city in America should have clean air, and with this
legislation, I firmly believe we will,'' the president declared
Thursday as he signed the 748-page bill aimed at cutting air
pollution dramatically over the next 15 years.
   As a result of the tougher pollution controls, Bush said, 100
cities now choking in smog will have cleaner air by the year 2000
and annually 56 billion pounds of pollution - 224 pounds for every
man, woman and child - will disappear from the atmosphere. Acid
rain will be significantly curtailed, as will toxic chemical
releases from factories, he said.
   ``It is simply the most significant air pollution legislation in
our nation's history,'' inaugurating a ``new era for clean air,''
Bush said.
   Today the president signed eight more bills on environmental
issues. They include measures to ban U.S. minerals exploration in
Antarctica until Congress approves a new international compact;
designate the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary off the
Florida Keys; establish national wildlife refuges in Bayou Cocodrie
in Louisiana and New Jersey's Walkill River; designate the Red Rock
Canyon National Conservation Area in Nevada's Mojave Desert; and
triple the size of the Coastal Barrier Resource System.
   He also signed bills to award teachers grants for environmental
education; fund further research on global warning; and foster
cleanup in the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain.
   Over the next decade, automobiles must emit 40 to 60 percent
less pollution; industrial plants must cut toxic air emissions by
90 percent; the oil industry must supply cleaner-burning gasoline
in cities with the worst smog, and coal-burning electric plants
will have to cut in half their emissions of sulfur dioxide, which
causes acid rain.
   Environmentalists, although praising Bush and lauding the new
law, expressed concern over hether the provisions will be
aggressively implemented and enforced.
   Some suggested that polluters, a few of whom already are
complaining that some of the new requirements cannot be met, will
seek to water down the law as the Environmental Protection Agency
writes the regulations to implement it.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a key architect of the legislation and
chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on environmental protection,
said ``now it's a matter of oversight and making sure it works.''
   EPA Administrator William Reilly said the agency has already
begun to hire several hundred additional employees to deal with the
new regulations and said he has no doubts the law will be
administered aggressively.
   ``Its the most ambitious law that EPA has ever administered,''
said Reilly. ``We recognize how ambitious it is. ... I believe
we're up to the challenge.''
   The EPA anticipates issuing at least 27 major new regulations
under the clean air law over the next two years. Eventually more
than 2,000 people will be involved in administering clean air
regulations, officials said.
   William Rosenberg, the EPA associate administrator who will
oversee those regulations, said the task of cleaning up the air
will be a decade-long effort. ``It's not going to happen overnight,
but we should see some progress in a couple of years,'' he said.
   Most of the bill's major provisions do not take effect fully
until the end of the decade. Many cities will have 10 to 15 years
to meet federal air quality standards.
   Richard Ayres, executive director of the Clean Air Coalition,
said that ``in every respect this bill is an advance over today's
law'' but maintained that its effectiveness will depend on how the
requirements are implemented and enforced.
   ``The tools are in the president's hands,'' and regulations can
be either pursued aggressively or in a halfhearted manner, said
Ayres, also an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   ``If George Bush succumbs to polluter pressure to emasculate the
Clean Air Act with ineffective regulations, Americans will never
breathe the clean air their president has promised them,'' said
Ruth Caplan, executive director of Environmental Action.
   Environmentalists noted that the original clean air law, enacted
in 1970, directed that cities achieve smog-free, healthy air by
1987. Last year, 96 cities had yet to meet those requirements.
   The 1970 law called on utilities to achieve cleaner air by
curtailing chemical emissions. A few years later, the utilities
received permission to meet the requirements by sending the
pollutants high into the air through tall smokestacks.
   Sulfur dioxide from those Midwestern smokestacks later were
found to be responsible for the acid rain that has damaged lakes
and aquatic life in the Northeast.

   Wheat and corn prices opened mostly higher today
on the Chicago Board of Trade after the government announced new
export business for both commodities. Soybeans also were higher.
   Wheat posted moderate gains in early trading after the
government's announcement that it is targeting three countries for
450,000 subsidized tons of the crop.
   Wheat had been suffering from above-average temperatures in the
regions where the winter crop is grown and a bountiful crop from an
earlier harvest.
   Corn opened lower, suffering from follow-through selling after
yesterday's sharply lower close. Corn futures firmed after early
reports of modest export business with Spain, South Korea and
Taiwan.
   Soybean futures rose after traders sought to cover their
positions from sharp losses posted late last week and earlier this
week.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents lower to 2\ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in December at 2.49} a
bushel; corn futures were { cent to 1 cent higher with December at
$2.22} a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1\ cents higher with December
at $1.11 a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents higher to 4{ cents higher

<HEAD>Court Lifts Ban on Mexican Tuna</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has lifted a
controversial nationwide ban on imports of yellowfin tuna from
Mexico.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday ended an
embargo ordered Oct. 4 by a federal judge in San Francisco. The
three-judge panel gave no reason for its action but scheduled oral
arguments in the case for next February.
   Imposed under a U.S. dolphin-protection law, the embargo has
stirred some anti-U.S. feeling in Mexico and has affected the
debate over establishment of a joint free-trade zone for the two
countries.
   A lawyer for environmental groups that fought for the ban said
the government submitted declarations to the court from
administration officials saying the embargo was disrupting
relations with Mexico on issues that included anti-drug efforts nd
petroleum sales.
   The officials included Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and
John Negroponte, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, said Joshua Floum,
lawyer for the Earth Island Institute and the Marine Mammal Fund.
   ``Congress knew if an embargo was imposed, Mexico wouldn't like
it. We're surprised that agents of the U.S. government are so
hostile to the law. (The court's action) will allow the continued
slaughter of dolphins by Mexico without the consequences
contemplated by Congress,'' Floum said.
   Floum said he would seek reconsideration of the ruling, signed
by Judges Thomas Tang, Jerome Farris and Alex Kozinski.
   Martin Hochman, regional counsel for the Commerce Department's
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the
government hopes to gain foreign cooperation in reducing dolphin
kills in meetings over the next several months.
   ``One reason for the kind of reaction we've gotten from foreign
nations is that it is unilateral action by the United States,''
Hochman said. ``The hope is, something can be achieved that will do
what the U.S. domestic legislation is aiming at but in a
cooperative way with the foreign countries.''
   He said a U.S. delegation, including environmental and tuna
industry representatives, has been meeting with eastern Pacific
tuna fishing nations to discuss a possible international
organization or agreement on the issue.
   Hochman said Mexico has the largest foreign tuna fleet but sells
most of its tuna to Europe.
   The suit was filed under a law aimed at reducing the killing of
dolphins that swim above yellowfin tuna in the eastern Pacific.
Some commercial tuna fleets deliberately drop their nets on
dolphins.
   The law requires the U.S. government to embargo tuna from
nations that fail to reduce their dolphin-killing below certain
levels: for 1989, twice the kill rate of the U.S. tuna fleet, and
for any year, a total kill that includes no more than 15 percent
eastern spinner dolphins, a protected subspecies.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson ordered a ban Aug. 28 on
imports of tuna from Mexico, Panama, Ecuador, Venezuela and the
Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, saying the Commerce Department
had failed to show that their 1989 dolphin kill rates were less
than twice the rate of the U.S. fleet.
   The Commerce Department never imposed the embargo on Ecuador,
Venezuela or Vanuatu, saying new figures from the first eight
months of 1990 showed that they were in compliance. Panama did not
meet the limit and is being embargoed.
   The department also said Mexico would not be embargoed because
it was below the limit for the first eight months of 1990. But
Henderson ordered an embargo on Mexican tuna Oct. 4 and extended it
Oct. 19, citing Mexico's excessive kills of eastern spinner
dolphins in 1989.
   Though Commerce Department figures showed Mexico below the 15
percent limit for eastern spinners in the first eight months of
1990, Henderson said the law protecting eastern spinners required
compliance for an entire year before an embargo could be lifted.
   Government lawyers argued that Henderson should have deferred to
the department's interpretation of the law.

   The stock market was mixed today in a session
marked by heavy selling of long-distance telephone issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.14 points to
2,533.91 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers held a narrow edge on losers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 665 up, 644 down and
535 unchanged.
   The stock of MCI Communications plunged 7\ to 22} in heavy
over-the-counter trading. Late Thursday the company announced a
restructuring and said the costs of corporate changes, along with
intense competition, loomed as a drag on earnings ``for the next
several quarters.''
   The shock effects of MCI's drop spread to other long-distance
telephone issues. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph fell 1~ to 32\;
United Telecommunications 3{ to 21~, and GTE Corp. { to 27}.
   In a statement responding to the stock activity, AT&amp;T said its
long-distance volume and revenues remained strong.
   In the economic news, the Labor Department said the nation's
core inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and energy
prices, advanced a moderate 0.3 percent last month.
   The report ``was definitely encouraging,'' said Michael Metz, a
vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``It suggests that if you
subtract oil, inflationary pressures are easing.''
   Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the nation's
trade deficit narrowed 3.3 percent in September, showing its first
improvement since June.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .47 to 172.65. At the merican Stock Exchange, the market
value index was unchanged at 296.69.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 78.75 million shares at
noontime, against 72.37 million at the same point Thursday.

   Telephone companies reported normal operations
today after bracing for a possible disruption of service somewhere
in the country by computer ``hackers'' breaking into the phone
network.
   Non-specific threats had been made to invade the massive
computers that control the telephone network, but not to attack
physical facilities, industry sources said.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
threats apparently were in connection with a sentencing scheduled
in Atlanta this afternoon for three members of a hackers' group
called the Legion of Doom who had broken into BellSouth Corp.
computers.
   Franklin E. Darden Jr. and Robert J. Riggs pleaded guilty
earlier this year in federal court to one conspiracy count each.
Adam E. Grant pleaded guilty to possessing 15 or more access
devices with intent to defraud.
   But late morning on the East Coast, no problems had been
reported.
   ``This has been a normal weekday and there's been no indication
of trouble anywhere in the network,'' said Herb Linnen, a spokesman
for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   On Thursday, Linnen had said AT&amp;T was aware of a ``purported
threat to try and disrupt at least part of the nationwide
network,'' and that company security officials had alerted AT&amp;T
managers nationwide to be alert.
   ``We have not been able to assess the validity of the threats,
but we certainly take any threats seriously, and we've taken
precautions to minimize the risk of intrusion,'' BellSouth
spokesman Bill McCloskey said.
   Linnen said the purported threat was not against any single
company. He said the rumor of the attempted disruption was
discussed at a regular meeting Wednesday of technical executives of
a number of phone companies.
   ``We have no idea how widespread the threat might be, but it's
our understanding that the group may be national,'' said Peter
Goodale, a spokesman for Nynex Corp., parent of the New England
Telephone and New York Telephone companies. ``We've taken the
appropriate security measures to ensure the integrity of our
network.''
   FBI and Defense Department officials said they were unaware of
any such threat.
   Federal prosecutors in Chicago last year charged that members of
the Legion of Doom had used their computers in February 1989 to tap
into the 911 system of Atlanta-based BellSouth and copy the
program.
   The information then was published in an electronic newsletter
in Chicago for hackers, but the 911 network was not disrupted.
   Charges against the Chicago publisher were dropped in July.

<HEAD>Center Explores New Ways to Teach Economics Without Losing
Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it comes to youngsters, studying the
economy has about the same appeal as eating vegetables, says
Suzanne Gallagher of Virginia Commonwealth University.
   ``Just give it a chance,'' said Ms. Gallagher, sounding like a
parent trying to get a child to take a mouthful of brussels
sprouts. ``Economics has a bad press, but it's not dull or
difficult.''
   Ms. Gallagher, who came to the school in July to teach teachers
how to teach economics, calls her class ``Economics, the Science of
Common Sense.''
   ``I think we all need to be economists on our own behalf,'' she
said. ``My favorite analogy is that you wouldn't send a child out
to play ball without explaining the rules of the game. You
shouldn't do that for the economy, either.''
   Through the efforts of the school's Center for Economic
Education, hundreds of teachers in public and private schools in
the state are mixing lessons on supply and demand, inflation and
economic alphabet soup - GNPs and CPIs - with regular studies on
social studies, science and other subjects.
   ``You think you have to sit and teach an economics lesson,''
said Michelle Via, who took a course at the school last year for
ideas to show her first-grade students at Mary Munford School in
Richmond. ``But you don't have to do that at all. You're already
doing so many things that relate to it.''
   Ms. Via decided to incorporate economics into a school project
on recycling aluminum cans. Besides learning math by counting the
cans and science by weighing them, Ms. Via's 25 students talked
about the scarcity of natural resources and why it is cheaper to
recycle aluminum than to mine the ore used to make the metal.
   Her students also learned about the capital resources needed for
recycling. ``They got to see the truck come in and pick up the
cans,'' she said.
   As the grade level increases, so does the sophistication of the
economics lesson.
   Carole Sandy, who teaches ancient history to eighth-graders at
Richmond's Collegiate Schools, has her students become citizens of
Rome. Some are nobles, some are soldiers and some are slaves. All
learn that their social status reflects their economic status.
   ``You either gain or suffer under the rule of Caesar Augustus,''
said Ms. Sandy, who first gained a respect for economics while
attending a UCLA pilot program in 1979.
   ``I was basically very cynical about economics,'' she said.
``Coming back as a promoter of economics was a pretty interesting
change around here.''
   Robert C. Jameison, a Brookland Middle School social studies
teacher, helps his seventh-graders learn about what he called the
``cottonball economics'' that played a role in precipitating the
Civil War. The students take on the roles of three sides in the war
- the industrial North, the agrarian South, and cotton-customer
England.
   Jameison said Ms. Gallagher's ideas on teaching economics are
excellent for getting students pulled into the subject. ``She makes
students realize there's more to a situation than meets the eye,
and it makes it fun,'' he said.
   Ms. Gallagher, who came here from the University of West
Florida's Center for Economic Education, said school activities
that relate to economics range from ``opportunity cost'' lessons -
choosing, say, to go out for pizza instead of studying - to
auctioning a candy bar to determine its market value.
   Virginia also has about 1,000 teams in various schools playing a
stock market game, a 10-week investment simulation program. Each
team starts with $100,000 in pretend money and buys, sells and
trades stocks to increase the team's wealth.
   ``It's a whole lot like the real world,'' she said. ``The kids
love it. It gives them something to talk to their parents about,
and the parents can learn something right along with their kids.''

   Fax machines big enough to send blueprints,
computers that fit into a pocket and gizmos of every size in
between line the miles of aisles at the world's largest computer
show.
   And if the machines don't catch the eye, the displays and
exhibitors probably will.
   At one booth at the Comdex show, a company's representatives
played ping-pong. At another, they pranced around dressed as
football players and cheerleaders. Across the hall exhibitors wore
Roaring '20s gangster getups.
   Pop music blared from displays hawking multimedia - the
combination of music, text, graphics and video that is one of the
hot items at this year's show.
   Overhead, green laser light danced across the ceiling of the
cavernous Las Vegas Convention Center. Conventioneers beneath it
lined up for free software and raffles that gave away CD players
and personal computers.
   A software display area featured giant Dixon pens and Crayola
crayons, symbolizing the software industry's theme of easy-to-use
graphics-based programs. Intel Corp.'s exhibit was anchored by a
walk-through computer, where inside the semiconductor company's
employees extolled the virtues of its microprocessor technology.
   Despite the circus atmosphere, many of the 120,000 attendees
appeared to be doing business at the show, which ended Friday.
Technical specifications on products were traded as freely as
business cards. Conventioneers' arms were laden with shopping bags
emblazoned with company logos that brimmed with glossy brochures on
new products.
   There was little evidence amid the hype that the economy may be
entering a recession, and that the computer industry has been in a
slump for several years. Both attendance and the number of
exhibitors was up from last year, said Comdex's organizers
   But a computer executive from a major insurance company said
corporations may start to think twice about buying new high-end
computer gear. He said makers of cheaper ``clone'' computers, which
mimic brand-name lines, could benefit.
   Here is a sampling of the more interesting items at Comdex,
where exhibits covered the equivalent of 50 football fields:
   -The Video Toaster. This $1,595 device converts a Commodore
Amiga personal computer into a video editing machine. NewTek, the
tiny Topeka, Kan., company that developed it, says Video Toaster
can do the same things as professional TV studio gear costing
$20,000. It can cut from one video to another with various special
effects, add titles and logos and colorize black-and-white images.
   -Computers that recognize handwriting. Probably the most
advanced on display is the Gridpad from Grid Systems Corp., a
subsidiary of Tandy Corp. The $2,370 Gridpad, which resembles an
Etch-a-Sketch, can recognize numbers and block letters written on
its screen with a special pen.
   -``Desktop offices.'' Canon's $2,495 Navigator combines a small
personal computer, phone, answering machine, fax and printer into a
desktop unit designed for the home office.
   -``Portable offices.'' This category includes Kodak's 3}-pound,
battery-operated printer, aimed at laptop computer users, and
Ricoh's 3-pound portable copier, which can be converted into a fax
machine by plugging in a 1-pound adapter.
   -Portable computers with improved color screens. Several makers
demonstrated models based on a technology called active matrix, in
which each pixel, or dot, on the screen is connected to a separate
transistor. It produces crisper, deeper colors than conventional
laptop color monitors.
   -``Palmtop'' computers. These models are so small they fit in a
coat pocket. Probably the most sophisticated is the $1,995 Poqet
machine from Poqet Computer. This 1-pounder runs most programs
written for the popular DOS operating system used by International
Business Machines Corp. computers and IBM compatibles.
   Among cheaper palmtops, Atari's $299 Portfolio contains a
calculator, address book, word processor, work organizer and diary,
but doesn't run DOS programs.
   But palmtops have a major drawback - tiny keyboards, which could
be awkward for many adult hands and make their word-processing
programs of limited use.
   -Car adaptors for portable devices. Several companies offered
products that plug into the cigarette lighter to provide current
for computing on the go.
   But the most novel products at Comdex may be Whereabouts, by a
company called ArtSoft. It's a series of humorous graphical
messages that a personal computer user can call up on the screen
before leaving the office.
   Among the messages are ``out to lunch,'' accompanied by a
picture of a pizza, and ``in a meeting,'' with a space for the
meeting-goer to type in the location.

   The General Motors Corp. will not
reopen its Fairfax plant on Monday as planned, the company said.
   Citing a drop in orders for the Pontiac Grand Prix, GM said
Thursday the plant will continue its shutdown until Dec. 3.
   About 3,000 production workers have been affected by the
shutdown, which has already lasted two weeks.
   GM did not elaborate on its action at Fairfax, but dealers and
analysts said it stemmed from a decline in orders from dealers.
   The Grand Prix has been selling above last year's levels in
recent months. October sales numbered 10,377, up 38 percent from
October 1989. But sales appear to be slowing in November, and
dealers have a more than adequate supply.
   ``There's a great concern from the people,'' said Clint Simmons,
bargaining chairman at United Auto Workers Local 31, which
represents Fairfax production workers. ``We haven't encountered a
30-day shutdown in a long time.''
   The last time the Fairfax plant was down for a month or more was
in January.

<HEAD>Long Drought for Budding Growth Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   How long can a bear market last?
   For a gloomy answer to that question, ask anyone in the
shrinking band of Wall Street investors who specialize in
small-company growth stocks.
   Fans of ``emerging growth'' companies get a lot of practice
being patient, enduring lengthy dry spells in their quest to
discover the budding IBMs, Mercks and Philip Morrises of the
future.
   But even their fabled stamina has been wearing down of late,
given the continued drubbing their favorites have been subjected to
in the market decline since midsummer.
   By most gauges, the last period of sustained prosperity in their
chosen field of expertise ended around the middle of 1983.
   ``Almost everyone involved in small growth stock investing
throughout the 1980s knows how it feels to get up off the canvas,''
observes analyst L. Keith Mullins in a current Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
appraisal.
   ``However, if you think the latest series of blows have been
particularly severe, you are right. From a historical perspective,
the small growth sector's abysmal recent performance is without
precedent.''
   When junior growth stocks started to lag behind the mighty bull
market in the mid-1980s, their admirers had several explanations to
console themselves with.
   No matter how bright small companies' futures might look, most
of them lacked the kind of undervalued assets corporate raiders
were looking for in the takeover boom on Wall Street.
   These up-and-comers didn't have the marquee names that attracted
big foreign investors. They got little benefit from the vogue for
index-fund investing, in which money managers bought up stocks of
big companies in order to duplicate the performance of some
yardstick such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock composite index.
   By the time Wall Street had weathered the crash of 1987, many
analysts figured that the small growth stocks were ready for a
comeback.
   After a short-lived burst of enthusiasm, however, investors
turned their backs on the group once again.
   Then, when the market as a whole ran into trouble this year,
junior growth stocks took yet another pounding. From the start of
July through September, the T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund, a
traditional standard-bearer of the emerging-growth camp, fell 26.4
percent.
   That was almost double the 13.7 percent loss recorded over the
same period by the S&amp;P 500.
   ``The third quarter was one of the most difficult periods in the
fund's 30-year history,'' John Laporte, the fund's president, said
in a report to shareholders.
   ``We were surprised by the susbtantial underperformance of small
company stocks because valuation levels were already at the low end
of historic ranges.''
   How low has the group gone now? Well, at Sept. 30 the
price-earnings ratio of the New Horizons Fund was .96 of the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500's P-E, equaling lows reached just twice
before - in 1977 and again after the '87 crash.
   In theory, small growth stocks should carry a ``normal'' P-E of
perhaps 1.5 times that of the overall market, if only because these
companies are in position to post greater-than-average profit
increases in the future.
   By an old rule of thumb, emerging growth stocks are a bargain
when their multiple vs. the overall market shrinks much below 1.5,
and should be sold as the multiple gets closer to 2.
   If you apply any standard of that sort now, says Laporte,
``emerging growth stocks look incredibly cheap.''
   From Mullins's perspective, ``the point is clear. The present
valuations for small growth stocks are either a temporary anomaly,
or the group has sunk permanently into uncharted valuation
waters.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. said Friday it was boosting
advertising rates by 7 percent for Barron's National Business and
Financial Weekly, effective in January 1991.
   The rate hike is the latest in a recent series of increases
announced at publications such as Time, Newsweek, U.S. News &amp; World
Report magazines despite the recent slump in demand for print and
broadcast advertising.
   It also comes only two weeks after the weekly announced it was
boosting its cover price by 50 cents to $2.50 effective with the
Dec. 3 issue and subscription prices by $10 a year to $109 in 1991.
   Barron's last advertising rate increase was 5.5 percent a year
ago. This year's 7 percent increase applies to its national and
regional editions.
   The national rate for a full-page ad will rise to $15,488.
   Robert Paradise, publisher of Barron's, said the increase was
fair and reasonable given the publication's efficiency in reaching
top corporate executives, financial professionals and individual
investors.
   Barron's weekly circulation averaged 250,789 in the latest
reporting period. Ad volume for the first nine months of the year
was off 4.3 percent.
   Barron's sister publication, The Wall Street Journal, announced
last week it was boosting its ad rates starting next year by 6
percent for national ads, 7 percent to 9 percent for regional
editions and 10 percent to 12 percent for overseas editions.

   America's merchandise trade balance narrowed
to $9.4 billion in September, the government said Friday. Analysts
said the improvement probably likely sprang from consumer
retrenchment in the face of a weakening economy.
   ``Imports were weak and that confirms the weakness in the
economy itself,'' said economist Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities
Co. International in New York.
   Consumers cut their purchases of imported goods by 2.4 percent,
to $41.3 billion, despite a 28.5 percent jump in the cost of
imported oil.
   Exports also dropped, down 2.2 percent to $31.8 billion.
   The difference meant a 3.3 percent improvement over August's
$9.7 billion gap.
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
in New York, noted that non-oil imports fell $2 billion and
predicted that ``this will continue.''
   ``That is, as consumer spending and capital spending weakens,
Americans will cut back not only on domestic goods, but imported
goods as well.''
   Many economists believe the economy has slid into a recession -
a possibility President Bush acknowledged for the first time
Thursday.
   ``I am concerned that we are in a downturn here,'' he said in an
interview with Cable News Network.
   Both the value and the volume of oil imports rose, pushing
America's foreign oil bill to $6.1 billion in September. That was
the highest since October 1981, when it reached $6.3 billion during
a period of global shortages.
   Oil prices in September, boosted by the Persian Gulf crisis,
jumped 24.4 percent to $24.31 a barrel. At the same time, shipments
rose 6.7 percent to 8.5 million barrels a day.
   Among the imports, shipments of foreign cars and both capital
and consumer goods fell. Foods and beverages were virtually
unchanged, while both industrial supplies including oil and other
merchandise rose slightly.
   Except for capital goods, almost all general categories of
exports fell.
   ``Export growth is supposed to be one of the factors that helps
this economy along and moderate the extent of the recession,'' said
economist John Silvia of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.
``But if exports continue to grow less than we expect, it means the
economy may go through a deeper recession than what we're going
through.''
   Bush administration officials have been counting on exports to
cushion a falling the economy, particularly as consumer spending
fades.
   Exports have accounted in recent years for a third of the
nation's economic growth. Consumer spending represented the other
two-thirds.
   Some economists believe a weaker dollar will help prop up
exports by making U.S. products less expensive overseas. But both
Brusca and Steinberg said they do not expect much improvement
before next year.
   ``Thirty percent of U.S. exports go to countries that are in a
recession,'' Brusca said. ``You shouldn't hold your breath for
exports to save the economy.''
   Nevertheless, J. Antonio Villamil, Commerce Department chief
economist, pointed to the surplus the United States has posted with
Western Europe so far this year, including $882 million in
September.
   ``For the first nine months of 1990, the trade surplus with
Western Europe stood at $3.5 billion compared with a deficit of
$600 million in 1989'' and $8.8 billion during the same period of
1988, he said.
   But at the same time, the biggest deficit continued to be with
Japan - a $3.05 billion imbalance, down from $3.78 billion in
August.
   Other deficits included Taiwan, $1.03 billion; China $1.07
billion; Canada, $1.25 billion; South Korea, $406 million; Hong
Kong, $231 million; and Brazil, $105 million.
   The September deficit pushed the gap to a seasonally adjusted
rate of $99.1 billion for the first nine months of the year. The
deficit peaked at $152 billion in 1987 and then fell to $118.53
billion in 1988 and to $109.40 billion last year.

<HEAD>Foreign Investors Are Buying U.S. Treasury Issues Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign buyers may be returning to the U.S.
Treasury debt market, despite higher interest rates at home and a
weak dollar that depresses the securities' value.
   Early numbers from the federal government indicate foreign
investors added $14 billion to their net holdings of U.S.
Treasuries between July and September.
   Although that doesn't come close to the levels at which overseas
investors were financing the federal deficit in the late '80s, it
is a sharp increase from a trend that appeared to be developing
earlier this year.
   In the first three months of 1990, foreign investors were net
sellers of $6.6 billion in Treasury securities and net buyers of
only $6 billion in the second quarter.
   With higher real interest rates available in Japan, Germany,
France and Britain, who would buy a security denominated in weak
dollars to earn low yields?
   Salomon Brothers' bond market researchers look to the Middle
East.
   Politically, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries have more to
gain by supporting U.S. bond prices than by picking up a few extra
percentage points elsewhere.
   ``We suspect that the principal foreign purchasers have been
official or quasi-official institutions,'' the investment firm said
in its weekly research report.
   Salomon Brothers cited a $10 billion third-quarter rise in the
amount of Treasury securities held in custody at the Federal
Reserve for international authorities as another sign that the
purchasers are tied to foreign governments.
   Japanese investors participated moderately in the Treasury's
record November refunding auction, buying 10-year notes and 30-year
bonds. But shortly after the auction, they turned around and sold
the securities in the open market.
   Dealers said the Japanese institutions were trying to show
support for the U.S. government, but with the weak dollar and
interest rates relatively unattractive to those in Japan, they
moved to get rid of the securities.
   The real interest rate, the nominal rate minus projected
inflation, is 4 percent on 10-year U.S. notes, according to Philip
M. Hubbard, director of London-based Consensus Economics Inc., an
economic survey firm. The real rates on 10-year bonds in Japan,
Germany, France and Britain are around 6 percent, Hubbard said.
   Although there has been more activity recently, it is unlikely
that foreign investors are substantially bolstering the U.S.
Treasury market, said Carol A. Stone, senior economist at Nomura
Securities International Inc.
   ``While foreign investors have taken large portions of Treasury
debt, they have never dominated domestic investors ... their recent
reduced participation has not at all resulted in higher interest
rates,'' she said in a weekly report.
   At the peak of foreign purchases of U.S. Treasuries - 1988 -
overseas investors bought $62 billion, or 44 percent of the
Treasury's total net issues. In 1989, net foreign buys were $30.3
billion, or 20 percent of the total.
   In the same period, yields on 10-year Treasuries averaged 8.85
percent in 1988 and fell to an average of 8.57 percent so far this
year, she said.
   Investors intent on keeping thier money in the United States,
meanwhile, have had plenty of reason to choose the Treasury market
over other securities.
   The weak U.S. economy and expectations of monetary easing by the
Federal Reserve prompts many to expect lower interest rates soon.
By buying now, they hope to lock in higher yields that might not be
available much longer.
   For quality, investors can't beat the U.S. government. With
fears about the effects a recession would have on state and local
governments to stay current with their municipal bond payments and
the junk bond market collapse, many investors are looking for less
risk.

   The sentencing of former Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. junk bond financier Michael Milken will take place on
Wednesday, a federal judge announced Friday.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood issued an order saying that the
sentencing was scheduled for Wednesday at 10 a.m. in Manhattan
federal court.
   Milken, 44, pleaded guilty in April to six counts of fraud and
conspiracy related to illegal securities trading. He faces a
maximum 28 years in prison. As part of his plea bargain, Milken
agreed to pay $600 million in penalties.
   The sentencing originally had been set for Oct. 1, but was
postponed so Wood could hear evidence to help her decide Milken's
punishment. The hearing on additional government charges not
included in Milken's guilty plea lasted about two weeks.
   Milken was first linked to the government's investigation of
Wall Street corruption in late 1986 by Ivan Boesky, the former
stock speculator who turned state's evidence and admitted to
widespread insider trading.

   The stock market was narrowly mixed today in a
session marked by selling pressure on long-distance telephone
issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.97 points to
2,548.02 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers held a narrow edge on losers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 747 up, 695 down and
537 unchanged.
   The stock of MCI Communications plunged 7&rsqb; to 22| in heavy
over-the-counter trading. Late Thursday the company announced a
restructuring and said the costs of corporate changes, along with
intense competition, loomed as a drag on earnings ``for the next
several quarters.''
   The shock effects of MCI's drop spread to other long-distance
telephone issues. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph fell 1\ to 31~;
United Telecommunications 2~ to 22{, and GTE Corp. &rsqb; to 27~.
   In a statement responding to the stock activity, AT&amp;T said its
long-distance volume and revenues remained strong.
   In the economic news, the Labor Department said the nation's
core inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and energy
prices, advanced a moderate 0.3 percent last month.
   The report ``was definitely encouraging,'' said Michael Metz, a
vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``It suggests that if you
subtract oil, inflationary pressures are easing.''
   Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the nation's
trade deficit narrowed 3.3 percent in September, showing its first
improvement since June.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .10 to 173.22. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .15 at 296.84.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 124.52 million shares with an

<HEAD>Fourth-Quarter Net Down for Hewlett-Packard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer giant Hewlett-Packard Co. on
Friday reported an 18 percent drop in fourth-quarter earnings,
which it attributed to increases in operating expenses and the cost
of goods sold.
   Net earnings totaled $202 million, or 83 cents per share, in the
quarter ended Oct. 31, compared to $246 million, or $1.04 per
share, in the same quarter last year.
   Net revenue rose 6 percent, to $3.6 billion from $3.4 billion
last year.
   John A. Young, president and chief executive officer, said the
drop in income was due to slower revenue growth, a weaker dollar
pushing up the cost of overseas operations and a higher cost of
goods sold.
   To offset such setbacks, Hewlett-Packard has consolidated some
manufacturing operations, offered voluntary severance and early
retirement programs and slowed hiring.
   ``Even though we've made good progress toward reducing our
expense structure, we haven't yet seen the full benefits of our
initiatives this quarter,'' Young said.
   For the year, net income totaled $739 million, down 11 percent
from $829 million in 1989. Per-share income declined 13 percent, to
$3.06 from $3.52.
   Net revenue for 1990 rose 11 percent to $13.2 billion, vs. $11.9
billion in 1989.

   Consumer inflation slowed slightly in October
and the country's trade deficit narrowed, but economists attributed
Friday's seemingly upbeat developments to the near certainty that
the nation has slid into a recession.
   Meanwhile, President Bush wrapped up a week of hastily called
meetings with his economic advisers and leading U.S. business
executives as the administration scoured for ways to alleviate the
pain from any economic downturn.
   Bush received a generally bleak assessment of the economy's
prospects from the executives, leading the president to acknowledge
the possibility of a recession for the first time. He continued to
insist, however, that any downturn would be brief and relatively
mild.
   ``Most seem to feel that if we have a recession, it will not be
deep and that we'll come out of it relatively soon, six months at
most, and I would like to think that is true,'' Bush said in an
interview with Cable News Network.
   The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index rose
0.6 percent in October, better than the 0.8 percent spurts that hit
in August and September as oil prices surged after Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.
   Prices rose a modest 0.3 percent last month for products not
related to energy. Economists said this ``core'' rate, often seen
as a better barometer of inflation, probably stayed relatively low
because the economic slump is holding down prices.
   ``The sliding economy is preventing the oil and energy shock
from causing a runaway on inflation,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist at the Boston Co.
   ``There's a hint here that we may get through this inflationary
shock from oil in reasonably good shape, but only at the cost of a
sharp downturn in the economy keeping inflation from getting out of
hand,'' Sinai said.
   Added analyst David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill:
   ``There's some good news on the inflation side, but bad news on
the real side, which is that the real economy is a mess.''
   The slightly improved inflation rate might give room to maneuver
to the Federal Reserve, which has been uner pressure from the Bush
administration to ease its inflation-fighting campaign and lower
interest rates to spur the economy, analysts said.
   ``With inflation stable or coming down, the Fed has some room to
fight'' a recession, Wyss said.
   Also Friday, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit narrowed 3.3 percent in September, the
first improvement since June. But the value of petroleum imports
was at its highest level in nine years because of escalating costs
due to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Imports dropped 2.4 percent to $41.3 billion despite a huge 28.5
percent jump in petroleum imports. But exports also fell, down 2.2
percent to $31.8 billion. The deficit is the difference between the
two.
   The improvement in the trade deficit, as with the better
inflation rate, was probably due to the economic slowdown shaking
consumer confidence and pushing down import buying, analysts said.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, plunged 2.1
percent in October. It was the largest decline since a 2.3 percent
drop in April 1979. The average weekly wage, before adjusting for
inflation, was $349.85.
   The weakness in the economy was reflected in the comments 20 top
business executives made Thursday and Friday during White House
meetings with the president.
   ``There is a general feeling that we are either in a recession
or very close,'' said Amoco Chairman Dick Morrow following Friday's
session.
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman, who attended the
meetings along with other top economic advisers, said that the
general consensus among the executives and the presidential
advisers was that the country was in a downturn, a word Bush
himself used during his CNN interview.
   ``As to what to do about it, that is the purpose of having these
meetings,'' Darman said. He said Bush will probably not make any
decisions on policy proposals until mid-December at the earliest.
   The 0.6 percent increase in consumer prices in October capped
the worst three-month bout of inflation since 1982.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, Americans' cost of living has risen
at an annual rate of 8.9 percent, nearly double the 4.6 percent
inflation rate for all of last year.
   Fuel oil prices have shot up more than 50 percent in the last
three months; gasoline prices have soared nearly 27 percent.
   However, analysts expect that inflation - without the outbreak
of a shooting war in the Persian Gulf - will return to more normal
levels in coming months as oil prices stabilize.
   ``If oil prices do not go up, one can expect the inflation fire
to basically be out by next spring,'' Sinai said.
   A recession could keep the oil price shock from filtering
through to the thousands of other energy-related products such as
chemicals, plastics and air fare.
   ``The economy's just not growing. If the economy's not growing,
people can't pass on price increases if they want to maintain
market share,'' said Peter Radford, an analyst with National
Westminster Bancorp. in New York.
   So far this year, inflation has risen 6.7 percent, well above
the 4.7 percent rate for the similar 10-month period last year, the
government said.
   In October, food costs rose 0.4 percent, double the 0.2 percent
increase of September, the government said. A slight drop in fruit
and vegetable prices was more than offset by larger increases for
other grocery store products, such as meats, poultry and eggs.
   Clothing costs were down 0.2 percent as prices fell for men's,
women's and children's apparel. Footwear prices were up 0.1
percent.
   Medical care prices jumped 0.8 percent, following similar sharp
increases in August and September. Those prices are now 9.4 percent
higher than they were a year ago.
   New car prices rose 0.5 percent in October while housing costs
were up 0.3 percent, the report showed.
   The various changes put the index for all consumer items at
133.5 in October. That means a hypothetical selection of goods and
services that cost $100 in the 1982-84 base period would have cost
$133.50 last month, up from $125.60 a year earlier.

   The Department of Veterans Affairs said Friday
it is lowering its maximum interest rate for federally backed VA
home mortgages by one-half percentage point to 9.5 percent,
effective Monday.
   ``This should provide a significant stimulus to the housing
market and the economy as a whole,'' said VA Secretary Edward J.
Derwinski.
   The new rate is for home and condominium loans. It means the
monthly payment for principal and interest on a typical VA loan of
$80,000 will total $672.29, down $29.37 a month from the previous
rate.
   The department increased the rate from 9.5 percent to 10 percent
last February.
   The department also lowered the rates for manufactured homes to
12 percent; graduated payment mortgages, to 9.7 percent;
manufactured home and lot combination loans, to 11.5 percent;
manufactured home lots only, 11.5 percent; and home improvement
loans, to 11 percent.
   It said in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, it guaranteed 196,600
home loans totaling $15.8 billion, compared to 188,000 home loans
totaling $14.4 billion in the previous year.
   VA home loan guarantees may be used to purchase, improve or
refinance a house or condominium and to purchase or refinance a
manufactured home.

   American Airlines, battling with United Airlines
for global dominance, announced Friday that its Sabre reservations
system is linking up with Europe's largest network.
   The combination with the Amadeus system gives American a network
with 126,000 reservations terminals, 40,000 more than United's
Covia system and its European partner, Galileo.
   Sabre and Amadeus announced in Paris that they had reached a
long-term agreement to combine technology and marketing to offer a
joint product worldwide.
   American is the world's second largest airline in terms of
revenue passenger miles and United is third, according to the Air
Transport Association in Washington. The Soviet airline, Aeroflot,
is No. 1.
   United's Covia system already is a 25.6 percent shareholder in
Galileo, a European system that is smaller but more advanced than
Amadeus.
   Madrid-based Amadeus gains access to Sabre's considerable
computer system and marketing muscle, which should help it compete
with Galileo.
   Amadeus so far ``has been the least effective system,'' said
David Richardson, an independent travel industry expert in Oxford,
England.
   Sabre, with 85,000 terminals in travel agencies and airlines
worldwide, claims to be the world's largest computerized
reservation system.
   As air travel becomes increasingly global, reservation systems
become more crucial to the success of airlines who want to sell
their products as far afield as possible.
   The systems provide wider, faster and more efficient
distribution not only of air tickets, but hotel rooms and car
rentals.
   ``In the long term, all the major airlines (listings) will be on
all the major systems,'' said Richardson.
   United and American last month fought over Pan American World
Airways' London routes, which United won with a $400 million deal.
   United also recently won a new route from Chicago to Tokyo but
American already had acquired Eastern's South American routes last
year. United won Pan Am's Pacific routes in 1985.
   John Hotard, an American spokesman in Fort Worth, Texas, said in
a telephone interview that Sabre is not buying a stake in Amadeus
and the two databases will remain separate. The deal will last at
least 20 years, he said.
   ``This is a marketing agreement which will give much more access
to Sabre in Europe,'' Hotard.
   Madrid-based Amadeus was formed in 1987 by equal partners Air
France, Spain's Iberia Airlines, Lufthansa German Airlines and the
Scandinavian Airlines System.
   Although it has 41,000 terminals, Amadeus was hampered when its
shareholders switched to a different computer system to get the
capability they wanted.
   Galileo, also founded in 1987, has 21,000 terminals and is based
in Swindon, England. Covia Corp., the 65,000-terminal system owned
by United, is one of 10 shareholders who include British Airways,
Swissair and KLM Royal Dutch Airways.

   U S West signed agreements with Czechoslovakia on
Friday to help develop communications systems in that country.
   Bell Atlantic International also is partner in the plan to
create joint venture companies with the country's Post and
Telecommunications Administrations.
   The Czechoslovakian administration will own 51 percent of each
company with Bell Atlantic and U S West jointly owning the
remaining 49 percent.
   The companies will build and operate cellular mobile and packet
data networks in Czechoslovakia. Initial service is expected to be
available in the second half of 1991, beginning in Prague,
Bratislava and Brno followed by expansion to other metropolitan
areas.
   Construction of a cellular network in Czechoslovakia is U S
West's third cellular venture in eastern Europe, company officials
said. The company is a partner with the Hungarian
Telecommunications Co., which is operating a cellular system in
Hungary.
   It's also signed an agreement to build the Soviet Union's first
commercial cellular system in Leningrad.

   Chrysler Corp. on Friday canceled
its ``JJ'' small sport-utility project, saying it cost too much
money to continue without a partner.
   Chrysler ad Fiat SpA of Italy recently called off talks that
included discussions about a joint project to develop the small
Jeep.
   ``While attractive as a joint venture, the JJ project as a
stand-alone program required too great a commitment of resources
that are needed for higher priority product programs,'' a Chrysler
news release said.
   Originally, the JJ was conceived as a joint project between
Chrysler and the French automaker Renault. It was to be built at a
factory in Spain and one not identified in North America.
   When Chrysler's relationship with Renault soured, the No. 3 U.S.
automaker turned to Fiat.
   The companies did not disclose what prompted them to call off
their talks.

<HEAD>The National Lays Off 18 Editorial Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National, the nine-month-old daily sports
newspaper running into financial problems even as it tries to
expand, has laid off 18 editorial employees to cut costs, a
spokesman said Friday.
   The layoffs, which amount to 6.5 percent of the company's total
employmnet of about 275, offer the most concrete evidence to date
of the privately held paper's difficulties in establishing itself
with readers and advertisers as the first national sports daily in
the United States.
   The newspaper has encountered a very difficult environment for
advertising as companies appear cut back on spending as the economy
weakens.
   That poor advertising market has driven some magazines out of
business and has prompted some media companies to close bureaus,
lay off reporters, seek concessions from remaining employees and
impose austerity measures.
   Spokesman Stephen Hammond said those being laid off at The
National include mostly editorial support workers such as layout
designers and copy editors at sites nationwide.
   The National currently publishes nine metropolitan editions in
cities spread from Boston to San Diego and plans to launch three
more - in Philadelphia, Atlanta and Baltimore-Washington - in the
next three months.
   But the paper has apparently been spending more than expected
when it was launched last winter with editions in New York, Chicago
and Los Angeles.
   Last week, the newspaper announced it was suspending publication
of its Sunday issue after Nov. 25 because of low circulation and
distribution difficulties. It will continue to publish on weekdays,
Monday throught Friday.
   Also last week, the president and publisher of the paper, Peter
O. Price, was stripped of day-to-day responsibilities for the
operation and three top executives - the circulation director,
assistant publisher and the finance and administration director -
were fired.
   The largest shareholder in the partnership that runs the paper,
the Univisa unit of Mexico's Televisa entertainment and publishing
company, put one of its U.S. executives, Jaime Davila, in charge of
the National's operations.
   A week ago, Editor in Chief Frank Deford told editorial staffers
that a handful of jobs may have to be eliminated but that he hoped
to do it through attrition rather than layoffs.
   ``That is what we hoped but nobody left,'' Hammond said.
   Efforts to reach Deford on Friday were unsuccessful. Price and
Davila also were said to be unavailable to the media.
   Hammond was asked whether the layoffs, which he said reduce the
number of editorial staffers at the paper to about 210, complete
the cutbacks.
   ``I can't give you an honest answer on that,'' he said.
   John Morton, who follows newspaper companies for the brokerage
Lynch Jones &amp; Ryan in Washington, D.C., said, ``This was bound to
happen.''
   ``They are trying to create something we have not had before.
Whenever you are inventing something new, there will be unexpected
events,'' he said.
   Morton said the National has had trouble competing for readers
with the sports sections of metropolitan dailies.
   In addition, it was launched during a ``media recession,'' he
said.
   ``These are the worst conditions in the newspaper business in 20
years. That is very painful for a new newspaper that is trying to
achieve a standing with readers and advertisers,'' Morton said.
   He said the question of whether The National will survive much
longer depends on how much its owners are prepared to lose.
   At the time of the launch, it was reported that Emilia Azcarrga,
the head of Televisa, was prepared to spend $100 million over five
years to make the paper profitbale.
   Morton declined to give odds on the paper's chances, but said
they were worse than when the paper was launched. ``The newspaper
environmnet has gotten worse, and that is going to cause them to
spend money faster,'' he said.

<HEAD>US-EC Fail To Bridge Gaps In GATT Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top U.S. and European Community
officials failed Friday to resolve differences over cutting
subsidies for farmers, putting world trade talks in jeopardy.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter estimated the chances
of a successful conclusion of the talks at ``much less than
50-50,''following the meeting with officials of the 12-nation
European Community.
   Yeutter, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Trade
Representative Carla Hills met with members of the EC executive
Commission to try to close gaps in world trade talks.
   ``Many problems do remain and not much time remains,'' said
Baker. ``But I think it is fair to say all of us are committed to
intense discussions at the highest level to resolve our
differences.''
   These gaps have brought the Uruguay Round of talks, a four-year
effort involving more than 100 nations, to the brink of collapse,
two weeks before the negotiations are to be completed.
   Both sides said they were committed to successful completion of
talks to liberalize world trade under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   But each side warned the talks could break down if the other did
not change its positions, especially on agriculture -- one of 15
areas under negotiation in the global trade talks.
   An EC offer to cut farm subsidies by 30 percent over 10 years,
beginning in 1986, is at odds with a proposal by the United States
and other major farm exporting countries to cut subsidies by 75
percent, starting in 1991.
   Also, the United States, Argentina, Canada, Australia and other
countries seek a 90 percent cut in export subsidies.
   The EC has made no offer on export subsidies, an issue that has
particularly upset Washington.
   EC Agriculture Commissioner Ray MacSharry told reporters there
was ``no question of compromise'' on the EC's offer saying the
United States ``must lower its expectations.''
   Yeutter said ``crucial elements'' of the EC proposal did not
``meet the criteria of success'' in the trade talks.
   He and Hills were to have more talks with EC officials over the
weekend.
   Friday's meeting was the second time this year the giant trade
partners held high-level meeting talks to reflect the increasing
importance they attach to closer transatlantic ties.
   The two sides also pledged to cooperate in providing aid for the
Soviet Union.
   ``We agreed on the importance of working together in the event
that there were requests from the Soviet Union for humanitarian
relief,'' Baker said.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Reaches New Low Against Mark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar declined broadly Friday and settled
at a new low against the German mark as the specter of lower U.S.
interest rates drove investors from the market.
   Gold prices were mixed. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold
settled at $378.90 a troy ounce, down 20 cents from Thursday.
Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for bullion at $379, up 25
cents an ounce.
   Much of the day's activity centered on the mark, which has been
rising on expectations that Germany's Bundesbank may be on the
verge of hiking interest rates. Such a move would make German
fixed-income securities more attractive to investors, thereby
enhancing their need for marks.
   Further hurting the dollar was the continuing expectation that
the Federal Reserve is preparing to lower interest rates.
Anticipation that the differential between U.S. and German interest
rates is about to widen worked against the dollar.
   In New York the dollar settled at a post-war low of 1.4705
German marks, down from 1.4755 marks on Thursday.
   Currency trading was active following a Labor Department report
showing that consumer prices were up a steep 0.6 percent in
October. But once volatile food and energy prices were subtracted,
the so-called core inflation rate registered a moderate 0.3
percent.
   ``The market seized on the figure,'' said John McCarthy, chief
dealer at Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank here. He said that because
inflationary pressures seem to be stabilizing, the Fed has more
room to maneuver interest rates downward.
   Around midday, the Fed announced it would injected reserves into
the banking system by buying Treasury bills with the promise of
repurchasing them soon, usually after the weekend.
   ``It looks like a clear signal of Fed easing,'' said Michael
Malpede, a senior analyst at Refco Group Inc. in Chicago. The
federal funds rate, the rate charged on overnight loans between
banks, also shifted lower, but several analysts said they wanted to
track the rate over the course of a few days to determine whether
it signified the easing the markets have been expecting.
   The Fed typically loosens credit to spur a flagging economy, but
the central bank has been inhibited by fear lowering interest rates
might heat up inflation.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 129.73 Japanese yen from
129.30 yen late Thursday. Later in London, it fell to 129.45 yen.
In New York, the dollar settled at 129.50 yen, down from 129.69 yen
on Thursday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9655 from $1.9590 late
Thursday. In New York it cost $1.9660 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Thursday's $1.9575.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates included: 1.2465 Swiss francs, down from 1.2518;
4.9685 French francs, down from 4.9850; 1,109.50 Italian lire, down
from 1,113.25; and 1.1633 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1624.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.4715 German marks, down from 1.4765; 1.2445
Swiss francs, down from 1.2515; 4.9690 French francs, down from
4.9890; 1.6595 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6650; 1,110.25 Italian
lire, down from 1,112.50; and 1.1643 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1617.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $376.25 a troy ounce, from
$379.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of
$376.20 an ounce from $378.60. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose
$1.08 an ounce to $380.11.
   Silver prices also were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $4.15 a troy ounce, up from
Thursday's $4.117. But in London the metal slipped to a late bid of
$4.11 a troy ounce, from $4.16.

<HEAD>Bankers Say Murdoch is Seeking $600 Million Bridge Loan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd. is seeking a $600
million bridge loan to help alleviate a short-term liquidity
squeeze brought on by tough market conditions, bankers said Friday.
   Murdoch and other senior News Corp. executives presented their
proposals to creditors earlier this week in Sydney and at a meeting
Thursday in London with British and European bankers.
   Australian-based News Corp. is trying to line up support for a
new credit facility of $6.5 billion to replace much of its existing
debt, bankers said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Several key institutions have given conditional support to the
proposal, the bankers said, but added it was too soon to say
whether News Corp.'s more than 100 lenders would accept the
proposal in full or in part.
   The short-term financing would be used largely as a guaranteed
line of credit until the media markets improve and the company can
begin disposing of about $1 billion in assets, they said.
   News Corp. is currently saddled with 2.9 billion Australian
dollars, or $2.2 billion, in short-term debt, the bulk of which is
coming due in July.
   Murdoch and other News Corp. executives told bankers that the
rescheduling, coupled with asset disposals and cost controls, would
better position the company to service its debts after 1991 when
trading conditions are expected to improve, the bankers said.
   News Corp. on Thursday reported a 31 percent drop in its fiscal
first quarter operating profit after taxes largely due to costs
associated with its European satellite television venture and
exchange rate factors.
   News Corp. confirmed Murdoch ``discussed a proposal to
reschedule bank debts through a new three-year agreement.''
   It added that he also assured bankers the company would seek to
reduce its debt load through disposals of ``non-core businesses''
over the period.
   News Corp. declined to identify what operations would be put up
for sale, but bankers said News Corp.'s 50 percent stake in
Australian Paper Mills, British coated paper manufacturer Townsend
Hook, and certain Australian printing operations were mentioned in
the talks.
   Some U.S. operations were also mentioned, bankers said,
including the Daily Racing Form, a newspaper dedicated to horse
racing, and Delux Labs, an affiliate of Twentieth Century Fox Corp.
   Murdoch also assured bankers that News Corp. would seek to hold
down operating costs by ``deferring major capital projects,'' News
Corp. said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil fell below $30 a barrel on the futures
market Friday, as perceptions that war in the Persian Gulf would be
delayed dragged crude to its lowest level in weeks.
   ``The whole thing looks like it's getting further and further
away,'' said Brian Tagler, a broker with Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc.
   Light sweet crude settled at $29.78 per barrel, down $1.34,
after falling as low as $29.25 for December delivery contracts at
the New York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts for crude delivery in
later months all traded lower, as did the rest of the energy
futures traded on the exchange.
   For the week, December crude fell $4.11 a barrel.
   Crude for next-month delivery had last traded below $30 per
barrel on Oct. 23, when oil hit as low as $28.30 before settling at
$29.37.
   Traders said the drop below $30 was having a psychological
effect on the market, just as oil's rise above $40 had.
   ``It's a big number. Everybody looks at it,'' Tagler said.
   The trading was partly technical, as traders liquidated their
positions on the December contracts, which go off the board on
Monday.
   Otherwise, they were looking mostly at the bearish implications
of news coming in from the Gulf.
   The market was responding in part to an ABC-TV interview with
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who said he wanted peace in the
Middle East, as well as reports that Iraq had told Iranian leaders
that it had not ruled out the idea of withdrawing from occupied
Kuwait.
   There have also been recent reports that the Egyptians, the
Soviets and some members of Congress are urging President Bush to
avoid an immediate confrontation.
   Bush's planned trip to visit U.S. troops in the Gulf for
Thanksgiving, which is observed next Thursday, has also led traders
to doubt any military actions are imminent.
   ``We may be seeing a grace period where nothing will happen,''
said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group
Inc., in Hoboken, N.J.
   Other energy futures also fell sharply on Friday.
   Home heating oil for December delivery dropped 2.25 cents to
84.42 cents a gallon, with later delivery months all moving lower.
For the week, heating oil fell 5.82 cents on December contracts.
   Unleaded gasoline futures fell for all delivery months, with
December contracts off 2.53 cents at 77.63 cents per gallon. For
the week, unleaded gasoline fell 10.60 cents.
   Natural gas contracts fell 6.5 cents to $2.335 per 1,000 cubic
feet for December delivery. Later months all moved down, mostly by
several cents.
   For the week, natural gas was off 8.4 cents per 1,000 cubic
feet.

<TEXT>
   Indiana business leaders, fed up with poorly
trained workers, offered education remedies including granting
parents the right to choose the schools their children attend.
   ``If the business community in this state really believes that
education has to get a lot better, and believes that it has a
vested interest in making sure that happens, then the burden is on
us to come forward with ideas, with a plan, to make it better,''
said James K. Baker, chairman of Arvin Industries in Columbus, Ind.
   Executives from Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Cummins Engine Co. and other
large firms said the state is threatening its own economic
development by producing workers who cannot read, write, compute or
communicate.
   Indiana high school graduation rates, after peaking at just over
80 percent in 1983 and 1984, have steadily worsened to about 75
percent last year. The state also ranked 19th among 22 states who
make wide use of the Scholastic Aptitude Test, a college entrance
examination.
   Baker, who is also chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
presented the executives' four-point state reform package at a
gathering of business officials, educators and public policy-makers
at the Indiana Convention Center.
   The plan proposed:
   - Preparing children at an early age for the rigors of
education.
   - Tighter school standards so students are prepared for the work
force.
   - Freeing teachers from burdensome regulations.
   - Allowing parents to send their children to the schools of
their choice.
   The proposals echoed a study last spring by the Brookings
Institution advocating broad school choice as the key to better
schools.
   It also follows numerous studies suggesting U.S. schools are
failing to produce workers equipped to compete in a global
marketplace.
   ``The time has come to put the education spotlight on the child,
not the system,'' Baker said. ``Public education should mean tax
dollars to educate children, not to support school systems.''
   Richard Wood, chairman of Indianapolis-based Lilly, asked
business officials to contribute to a lobbying effort to change the
state school system. State Superintendent of Public Instruction H.
Dean Evans applauded the involvement of the business community,
adding it could provide a breakthrough for reforms, including the
controversial principle of school choice.
   ``I see no problem whatsoever in injecting competitive spirit
into the school environment,'' he said.

   The stock market eked out a small gain Friday in
an advance restrained by selling pressure on long-distance
telephone issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.20 to 2,550.25,
stretching its gain for the week to 61.64 points.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 766 up, 725
down and 517 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 165.44 million
shares, up from 151.37 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 198.47 million shares.
   The stock of MCI Communications plunged 7&rsqb; to 22| in heavy
over-the-counter trading. Late Thursday the company announced a
restructuring and said the costs of corporate changes, along with
intense competition, loomed as a drag on earnings ``for the next
several quarters.''
   The shock effects of MCI's drop spread to other long-distance
telephone issues. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph fell 1&lsqb; to 32;
United Telecommunications 2~ to 22{, and GTE Corp. | to 27|.
   In a statement responding to the stock activity, AT&amp;T said its
long-distance volume and revenues remained strong.
   In the economic news, the Labor Department said the nation's
core inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and energy
prices, advanced a moderate 0.3 percent last month.
   The repor ``was definitely encouraging,'' said Michael Metz, a
vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``It suggests that if you
subtract oil, inflationary pressures are easing.''
   Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the nation's
trade deficit narrowed 3.3 percent in September, showing its first
improvement since June.
   Brokers said the most recent data evidently gave the Federal
Reserve whatever encouragement it might still have needed to take
new steps toward lower interest rates in the money markets.
   But the reaction in the stock market was mild at best. Analysts
have said the market largely anticipated a move toward easier
credit with its recent rise to eight-week highs.
   General Electric rose &rsqb; to 55&rsqb; as the company raised its
quarterly dividend from 47 cents a share to 51 cents a share.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included International
Business Machines, up 1 at 113|; Exxon, up &rsqb; at 50&rsqb;; Coca-Cola, up
{ at 45}, and Merck, up &rsqb; at 85.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $0.04 billion, or less
than .01 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .18 to 173.30.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index held steady at 371.23, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up .10 at 317.12.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
3.61 to 350.85. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 297.52, up .83.

   When the lawyers and accountants complete their
tally, total fraud claims against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. are
expected to approach the ridiculous sum of $30 billion.
   The firm has only about a tenth of that amount in assets. No one
has yet proved the allegations of systematic fraud, deception and
other forms of cheating by Drexel and its junk bond empire have any
validity.
   But in bankruptcy court, as in budget proposals and Turkish
bazaars, the idea is to exaggerate, negotiate and hope the middle
ground is a little higher than expected.
   ``Everyone is inflating their initial claims,'' said John C.
Coffee Jr., a securities law professor at Columbia University.
``People see this on the outside as a fight between Drexel and
these claimants. It's not. It's a fight among Drexel's creditors
committees.''
   The battle involves entities that claim they were stiffed when
Drexel, the Wall Street prima donna whose comeuppance was a 1989
criminal securities fraud guilty plea, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy court protection in February.
   Legal experts said no group of creditors is likely to receive
even half its claims. But inflated requests can improve leverage
during negotiations among creditors, who ultimately must approve
any reorganization plan.
   While Drexel's resources are limited and the filing deadline for
claims passed last week, claimants plan to bring separate cases
against other entities who actually have money.
   The government's efforts are expected to focus on a Drexel-led
network of individuals and savings and loan institutions that
regulators charge manipulated the nation's junk bond market in the
1980s.
   In their claim against Drexel, two federal thrift agencies are
seeking $11.3 billion for allegations that rigged junk bond
dealings helped topple 48 S&amp;Ls. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
and Resolution Trust Corp. described a conspiracy among major
thrift institutions that did business through Drexel. If the court
supports the theory, dozens of individuals and institutions named
in the claim could face lawsuits from the government.
   Legal experts said likely targets are former Drexel executives
such as CEO Frederick Joseph and convicted junk bond financier
Michael Milken; Drexel's insurance companies; still-functioning
savings and loans; indicted and unindicted thrift executives; and
companies swept up in Drexel's dealmaking.
   ``Those people are solvent,'' Coffee said. ``They have deeper
pockets. Michael Milken has a few million or so sitting around.''
   ``Claims can be brought against a lot of people in this alleged
conspiracy,'' he said.
   The FDIC said it is continuing an investigation of failed
thrifts with ties to Drexel, which controlled about two-thirds of
the risky high-yield debt securities that S&amp;Ls bought with
federally insured deposits.
   Entities outside the thrift industry someday also could be
exposed. S&amp;L holdings were only a small percentage of the entire
junk bond market - about $15 billion of $200 billion in securities
issued.
   For now, the government and other claimants want to recover
money from Drexel. Attorneys are negotiating to try to reach a
settlement figure of all the litigation that would be passed onto a
federal judge for approval.
   The FDIC and RTC are seeking $6.8 billion from 47 failed thrifts
in connection with junk bond losses, securities fraud and other
alleged lawbreaking by Drexel. A separate claim for $4.5 billion
was filed on behalf of Columbia Savings and Loan Association of
Beverly Hills, Calif., which has not been seized by the government
but has huge junk bond losses.
   Another $9.3 billion is sought by investors, shareholders and
companies who allege they were defrauded in the deals to which
Drexel pleaded guilty. Add on at least $8 billion more from Drexel-
and Milken-related cases consolidated before a federal judge in New
York. Other actions scattered nationwide seek $2 billion, lawyers
said. All the claims reflect tripled damages under organized crime
laws.
   In a bankruptcy reorganization, the legal claims would fall
somewhere below those of secured creditors such as banks or
financial firms who lent Drexel money. But the threat of such
massive claims is that they will dilute the pie for everyone. A
reorganization plan will allot a percentage of Drexel's assets to
creditors.
   Plaintiffs lawyers admit the claims are inflated - but that is
part of the bankruptcy game.
   `To get our proper percentage of Drexel's assets we have to
assert our full claims against it,'' said Melvyn I. Weiss, a New
York lawyer whose firm filed the $9.3 billion claim alleging 18
separate securities frauds and listing scores of defendants - each
of whom is individually liable.
   ``That's what bankruptcy is all about,'' dded David Berger, a
Philadelphia plaintiffs lawyer who also is suing Drexel.
   Before any money is apportioned, claimants have to persuade
Drexel's lawyers and a bankruptcy court judge their allegations are
substantial enough to merit a large settlement.
   Legal experts said the FDIC and RTC will have to prove that
thrifts bought junk bonds from Drexel despite knowing they were a
bad investment with the intent of manipulatively propping up prices
and deceiving outside investors.
   If no settlement is reached, the judge may call a trial to
resolve the claims. To prevent a trial from delaying the bankruptcy
reorganization, the judge could set aside a portion of Drexel's
estate as potential compensation, depending on a verdict.

<HEAD>Heavy Job-Cutting Reported as MGM and Pathe Merge Operations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly one-third of the workers at
newly formed MGM-Pathe Communications Co. have been handed pink
slips since Giancarlo Parretti bought the MGM-UA studio two weeks
ago.
   ``As with any merger, there was duplication in a number of areas
that could not be maintained on any sound economic basis,'' a
Pathe-MGM statement said Friday.
   The Italian financier's Pathe Communications Corp., which
operates movie theaters in Europe and makes films, paid $1.36
billion for MGM-UA Communications Co.
   Spokesman Craig Parsons said nearly 300 of the company's 1,000
workers lost their jobs since the merger. The cuts were completed
by Wednesday and no more are expected, he said.
   Lower-level employees who agreed not to sue were paid through
the end of the year, plus a week's notification pay and a week for
every year with the company. Middle level managers got nine months'
pay. Top managers under contract were negotiating.
   However, haste and snarled communications angered and upset many
workers, including some at top levels.
   ``One was a senior executive who was asked to take some names
off the distribution list on a confidential report, because they
were no longer going to be with the company,'' said one official
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``The guy looked at the list, and his own name was on it,'' he
said.
   Parretti bought MGM-UA from Kirk Kerkorian, a billionaire who
made his fortune in the used airplane and casino businesses.
   Kerkorian sold many of the company's assets over the years,
including the studio buildings and most of the rights to the
historic MGM film library. New movie production has been dormant
for the two years MGM-UA has been on the block.
   One still-thriving MGM-UA business was its network television
operation (``thirtysomething,'' ``In the Heat of the Night,'' ``The
Young Riders'') - a division that was spared the ax.
   But Parretti, who has hired Alan Ladd Jr. as his filmmaking
chief, let go virtually all the remaining film production staff.
   Still unsettled was the future of Richard Berger, MGM-UA's
studio president. He said he'd been negotiating with Parretti, but
had received offers to work elsewhere, and would probably decide
next week.

<HEAD>Fed Agreed to Interest Rate Ease at October Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve policy-makers agreed in early
October to ease interest rates if a federal budget-cutting
agreement was reached and to permit further easing if economic
conditions warranted, records released Friday showed.
   Four weeks after the Oct. 2 meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee, the federal funds rate dropped to 7.75 percent from 8
percent as the Bush administration and Congress agreed to a
deficit-reduction package.
   No further easing occurred. But the committee met again on
Tuesday and some economists predicted it had voted to again lower
interest rates to stimulate an economy that many analysts contend
has skidded into a recession.
   Until recently, the Fed has been reluctant to ease credit
because of fears the country was on the verge of an inflationary
spiral caused by the jump in oil prices after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   In fact, three of the four committee members opposing the easing
of rates that eventually occurred Oct. 29 dissented because they
felt ``the committee risked losing sight of its fundamental
objective of controlling and ultimately bringing down inflation.''
   However, oil-price increases have not spread to other costs. In
fact, the Labor Department reported on Friday that the core rate of
inflation - the rate excluding food and energy - rose only 0.3
percent in October.
   According to the committee meeting minutes released on Friday,
Fed governor Martha Seger dissented from the majority vote because
she favored permitting lower interest rates immediately.
   The other dissenters - governor Wayne D. Angel, district bank
Presidents Robert H. Boykin of Dallas and W. Lee Hoskins of
Cleveland - opposed any easing.
   The majority included Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, governors
Edward W. Kelley Jr., John P. LaWare and David W. Mullins Jr., and
presidents Edward G. Boehne of Philadelphia, E. Gerald Corrigan of
New York and Gary H. Stern of Minneapolis. There is one vacancy.
   The federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for
overnight loans, has been used for two years in combating
inflation. It had peaked at 9.75 percent in the spring of 1989 but
the central bank has let it drop in quarter-point increments since
then to stimulate economic growth. It had fallen to 8 percent last
summer.
   Some analysts said they thought the Fed might have voted on
Tuesday to cut the discount rate it charges commercial banks for
loans. That rate has stood at 7 percent for more than four years.
   The committee is composed of the seven Fed governors and five of
the 12 presidents of Fed regional banks. It meets in secret eight
times a year to formulate monetary policy. Minutes are released
about six weeks later, a few days after the next meeting.

   Platinum futures prices showed impressive strength Friday on New
York's Commodity Exchange as Japan logged substantial orders for
the commodity.
   On other commodities markets, silver ended higher; gold fell;
energy futures dipped; soybeans and grains rose; and meat and
livestock futures climbed.
   Platinum settled $5.70 to $6 higher with the contract for
delivery in January at $421.70.
   Despite a report released earlier this week indicating a glut of
the commodity, prices gained steadily throughout the day on word
that Japan is placing more orders for use in jewelry and automobile
parts.
   ``Japan has always been a big buyer of platinum, and the orders
coming in now have negated the effects of any surplus,'' said Carl
Denney, an analyst for Johnson Matthey Inc. in New York.
   Gold prices slipped most of the day on the Commodity Exchange
but rallied late to close with a slight loss. Analysts said the
precious metal followed plunging oil prices but were helped by late
commercial buying. Silver also rallied after dropping early.
   Gold settled $1.20 to 20 cents lower with December at $379.80 a
troy ounce. Silver settled 3.3 cents to 3.5 cents higher with
December at $4.15 an ounce.
   Energy futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange slid below
psychological resistance points as traders continued to bet on
near-term peace in the Persian Gulf. Crude oil slipped below $30 a
barrel for the first time since Oct. 22.
   Light sweet crude settled $1.34 to 78 cents lower with Decemberat $29.78
a barrel; heating oil settled 1.25 cents to 2.25 cents
lower with December at 84.42 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
settled 1.95 cents to 2.93 cents lower with December at 77.63 cents
a gallon.
   Soybeans futures prices were buoyed on the Chicago Board of
Trade by aggressive commercial and professional buying amid
continuing reports of improved export business.
   Soybeans futures staged a comeback following sessions of
lackluster trading or double-digit losses in the week after a
government report indicated a higher-than-expected soybean crop.
   ``We've gone a week since the crop report came out, and it's
about time they recovered,'' said Rich Feltes, director of
commodities research at Refco Inc. ``We also had some rather
impressive export sales numbers released by the government
(Thursday) night that helped.''
   Corn opened down on the Board of Trade, suffering from
follow-through selling after Thursday's sharply lower close. The
future later firmed after reports of modest export business with
Spain, South Korea and Taiwan.
   Wheat posted moderate gains after the government's announcement
that it is targeting three countries for 450,000 subsidized tons of
the crop.
   Wheat had been suffering from above-average temperatures in the
regions where the winter crop is grown and a bountiful crop from an
earlier harvest.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 3 cents higher with December at
2.50\ a bushel; corn futures settled 3 cents to 4{ cents higher
with December at $2.25 a bushel; oats settled 1{ cents to 2 cents
higher with December at $1.11} a bushel; soybeans settled 5\ cents
to 9{ cents higher with November at $5.66} a bushel.
   Cattle futures prices settled higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange after gaining support from a late-afternoon rally in pork.
Feeder cattle prices also gained following an Agriculture
Department report that some of next week's cattle already had been
sold.
   Hog futures reversed Thursday's losses in a volatile trading
session. Traders moved to cover their positions over the weekend as
they waited to see whether a U.S.-European food-aid package to the
Soviet Union would come out of President Bush's trip to Europe.
   Live cattle settled .08 cent to .40 cent higher with December at
79.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle was .08 cent to .15 cent higher
with January at 87.70 cents a pound; hogs were .35 cent to .93 cent
higher with December at 53.70 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were up to the 2 cents trading limit with February at 72.12 cents a
pound.

<HEAD>Phone Company Stocks Tumble After MCI Discloses Troubles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Phone company stocks took a pounding Friday
after MCI Communications Corp. said its financial performance could
falter due to stepped-up competition from AT&amp;T, the economic slump,
a cost-cutting program and a recent acquisition.
   The decline was accelerated by a number of Wall Street stock
analysts, who lowered their earnings forecasts for the nation's No.
2 long-distance phone company. They also cut their forecasts for
the parent of No. 3 U.S. Sprint.
   MCI stock lost more than a quarter of its value, plunging $7.37{
to close at $22.62{ in national over-the-counter trading. MCI is a
mainstay of the over-the-counter market as one of NASDAQ's most
widely followed and actively traded stocks.
   Though the news appeared to favor American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co., the stock price of the dominant long-distance company also
suffered, falling $1.12{ to close at $32. AT&amp;T was the most active
issue on the New York Stock Exchange, with more than 3.7 million
shares changing hands.
   ``The concern is that if MCI is hurting they might have to get
more aggressive with pricing and the whole industry could be
affected,'' said Joe Bellace, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst.
   AT&amp;T took the unusual step of releasing a statement about its
stock activity. AT&amp;T is the nation's most widely held stock.
   ``Today's decline in AT&amp;T's stock price apparently is a result
of concern among investors about the telecommunications industry.
The fundamentals of AT&amp;T's business are sound. Our third-quarter
long-distance volumes were strong, and current volume and revenue
trends are consistent with those results,'' the company said.
   Share prices of United Telecommunications Inc., the majority
owner of Sprint, and of GTE Corp., which owns the remaining 19.9
percent of Sprint, also fell. United Telecom dropped $2.87{ to
close at $22.50, while GTE slipped 62{ cents to $27.62{.
   MCI disclosed its cost-cutting plan the after the stock markets
closed Thursday. It said it may lay off up to 1,500 employees in a
restructuring prompted by the sluggish economy and a more
competitive long-distance phone market.
   The Washington-based company also cited the cost of its recent
$1.25 billion acquisition of long-distance carrier Telecom USA.
   MCI President Bert C. Roberts Jr. said these factors ``are
negative constraints on the company's financial performance for the
next several quarters.''
   Merrill Lynch's Bellace said MCI officials painted an even
bleaker picture in a conversation with him.
   ``Increased competetion from AT&amp;T is resulting in lower customer
retention rates,'' he said. ``This is the first time we have a high
risk that MCI's market share penetration may slow.''
   Analysts said AT&amp;T has become more aggressive in fighting to
retain its existing customers and to win back customers who
defected to MCI and Sprint.
   Gregory Sawers of the investment firm Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.
traced AT&amp;T's stronger marketing moves to a decision by the Federal
Communications Commission about a year ago that gives the phone
giant more latitude in cutting rates.
   ``AT&amp;T is getting its competitive act together at a rate far
faster than anyone expected,'' he said.
   In recent months, the company redeployed 5,000 employees to its
marketing force, boosted its advertising budget substantially and
started mentioning MCI by name in its ads, he said.
   ``Investors are fearful we're going to go through a period when
these guys beat on each other's heads with clubs. Ultimately,
that's not how this will work. Some type of implicit understanding
between the three carriers will emerge,'' Sawers predicted.
   He added that AT&amp;T, in the end, does not expect to lose
``endless amounts of market share.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coniston Partners, the largest shareholder of UAL
Corp., said Friday it has dissolved the subsidiary it formed to
push for an employee buyout of the Chicago-based parent of United
Airlines.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New
York-based investment group said Condor Partners liquidated on
Thursday and distributed its 2.4 million shares of UAL common stock
among Coniston's general and limited partners.
   The stock amounts to about 11 percent of UAL's 21.8 million
shares outstanding.
   Condor Partners sold more than 186,000 UAL shares on the open
market between Nov. 6 and last Monday at prices ranging between $97
and $100 a share, according to the filing. UAL closed at $99.75
Friday, down $1.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
   In September, a United Airlines workers group ended an agreement
with Condor aimed atbuying the airline for $201 per share, or
about $4.4 billion.
   Condor had threatened to seek control of UAL's board of
directors if the board did not agree to the employee' bid. The bid
failed in October after workers were unable to get bank financing
for the deal.
   UAL made peace with Coniston later by agreeing to add two
Coniston representatives to its board of directors.
   Coniston's general partners are Keith Gollust, Paul Tierney Jr.
and Augustus Oliver. In July, the partners dissolved their $850
million investment pool but held on to their UAL stake and a
controlling interest in TW Services Inc., a restaurant and
food-service company.

<TEXT>
   The New York Mercantile Exchange, the oil market
that has come under criticism as a forum for speculation on war
fears, is sponsoring a holiday party for families of soldiers in
the Persian Gulf.
   The rock star Tiffany will ppear at the Dec. 2 event set up at
Manhattan's Roseland Ballroom by USO of Metropolitan New York with
money from the Mercantile Exchange, organizers said Friday.
   ``The members of this exchange have been deeply concerned about
the families of these servicemen and women during the holiday
season,'' said Z. Lou Guttman, chairman of the futures market.
   ``For many of them, it is the first time they have not been able
to celebrate the holiday together as a family unit. This is one
small way of expressing our gratitude for the selfless sacrifice
and bravery they are demonstrating.''
   The Mercantile Exchange and USO said they expected about 1,000
relatives of soldiers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to
attend the party, which they said will feature carnival games, face
painting, magicians, Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles, Bart Simpson
and clowns.
   The Mercantile Exchange wanted ``to do something for the
families over there and also get some good press over it,'' USO
spokesman Michael Gray said Friday.
   An exchange spokeswoman said the board's decision to host the
party had nothing to do with recent controversies over oil prices.
   ``This has to do with the fact that the exchange wants to help
the families,'' said the spokeswoman, who under exchange policy
cannot be identified by name.
   The exchange said it has profited from the oil crisis, though
not as much as some successful oil traders.
   ``We've had increased volume,'' said the exchange spokeswoman.
``It's like a dollar-something we make on each trade. It's not like
major, major income. You're not putting us in a category with a
successful trader.''
   During August, the month that Iraq invaded Kuwait, the exchange
brought in more than $44,000 extra each day, when numbers are
compared with the yearly average, according to figures provided by
the exchange.
   By October, when activity had tapered off, the exchange's
increased volume was resulting in more than $8,000 a day in
increased money for the market, according to those same figures.
   The exchange is spending $92,500 on the event, according to a
source who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   Among the invited guests are politicians from the tri-state
area, including Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., who held a
hearing into the trading on the exchange and characterized its
participants ``speculator sharks.''
   Lieberman's spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said Friday that the senator
might attend the exchange-sponsored party, because many of his
constituents would be there, and he hoped it would be a success.
   Lieberman's earlier remarks ``were targeted more to the activity
on the exchange rather than the entity of the New York Mercantile
Exchannge itself,'' Kennedy said.

<HEAD>Report: Northwest Chairman Exploring Buyout of Eastern</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines Chairman Alfred
Checchi is exploring a buyout of Eastern Airlines using up to $150
million in pension funds of Eastern's union pilots, according to a
report Friday.
   The Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported that officials of the
Eastern Air Line Pilots Association have said union leaders are
agreeable to a Northwest acquisition. The officials also said their
leaders are willing to pitch the idea of lending Checchi the
pension funds, the paper reported.
   A spokesman for Northwest, based in Eagan, said only that
dealings involving Eastern are ``a private matter.''
   Eastern's court-appointed trustee, Martin R. Shugrue Jr.,
succeeded Wednesday in getting a $15 million cash infusion from a
bankruptcy judge in New York. Shugrue said the next day he would be
happy to talk to anyone interested in Eastern.
   A Northwest buyout of Eastern is viewed as a long shot prospect
by some analysts. Creditors are pressing a bankruptcy judge to have
Eastern liquidated, and such a buyout would take time to put
together.
   ``They have to act awful quick,'' said Paul Karos, airline
analyst for First Boston Corp. in New York.
   Checchi has long been interested in acquiring selected Eastern
assets, but he has had little success in winning creditors'
attention. A series of bids he submitted earlier this year included
an offer to liquidate Eastern, but little cash.
   The Pioneer Press quoted an unidentified source who is familiar
with recent talks between Checchi and the Eastern pilots as saying
both sides are exploring the idea.
   ``The Eastern pilots are dead serious,'' the source said.
Checchi is likewise viewing the idea seriously, the source said.
   Union leaders said that for Checchi to borrow money, he would
have to agree to buy the entire airline and hire the union pilots
to fly Eastern's jets. Union spokesman E.J. Breen said members
would have to agree to the loan and it is not clear whether they
favor it.
   Another union official, Ernest Dodson, said leaders would also
insist on preferred stock in Northwest, status as a secured
creditor, or other assurances that their investment is worthwhile
and safe.
   Precisely how much money could be raised also is unclear. Union
officials acknowledged that the funds could total as much as $200
million. But even if many pilots agree to allow their pension funds
to be used for the loan, the total amount available could be
reduced sharply by pilots who choose not to participate.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Jump on Clear Sign Fed Has Eased Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID E. KALISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose sharply Friday amid intense
speculation among traders that the Federal Reserve has moved to
lower interest rates.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond jumped 13-16 point, or
$8.13 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which falls when prices
rise, was down to 8.45 percent from 8.53 percent late Friday.
   Traders said they viewed a drop Friday in the federal funds rate
as a clear indication that the Fed has moved to relax credit
policy. The federal funds rate is the rate banks charge each other
on overnight loans, and is closely watched to determine a change in
monetary policy.
   The rate late Friday was 7 9-16 percent, down from 8 percent
late Thursday.
   A lowering of interest rates is viewed by credit market
participants as a positive development because it generally
increases the value of bonds.
   ``I think it's finally getting down there. Today's operation
more clearly indicates they have eased,'' said Carol A. Stone,
senior economist at Nomura Securities International Inc.
   Stone and others said the final test of whether the Fed has
moved to ease interest rates will be if the federal funds rate
remains around the 7{ percent level after this weekend. The Fed's
target had been 7} percent.
   ``The timing of the easing is important. It puts additional
pressure on banks to reduce their prime lending rate'' during the
crucial holiday shopping season, said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief
economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Inc.
   Traders said release early in the day of the government's
monthly measure of consumer prices, which showed a relatively low
inflation rate for prices of key retail goods, provided the Fed
with impetus to lower rates.
   Prices excluding the volatile food and energy components - the
so-called core rate - were up a more moderate 0.3 percent in
October, the same as in September but under the 0.5 percent rise in
August, the government said.
   The report of only moderate inflation was another factor giving
the credit markets a lift because inflation generally erodes the
value of bonds.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term
maturities rose 1-16 point to 5-32 point, intermediate maturities
were up 3-16 point to 17-32 point and long-term issues rose 21-32
point to ~ point, according to the Telerate Inc. financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.93 to 1,172.63.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.30 percent as the
discount fell 1 basis point to 7.08 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 7.37 percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to
7.02 percent. Yields on one-year bills were down to 7.26 percent as
the discount fell 7 basis points to 6.80 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose \ point to 91 11-32. The average yield
to maturity was down to 7.48 percent from 7.52 percent late
Thursday.

   Three-D graphics, blaring dance music and
MTV-like images lured convention-goers at the Comdex computer show
this week as nearly every major computer maker promoted
``multimedia'' - the marriage of computing, graphics and
television.
   But some industry-watchers say the hype may be premature, since
the multimedia market is small and has yet to find its bearings.
   That didn't stop IBM from driving home the point that it is
serious about multimedia. A breakfast gathering sponsored by the
world's largest computer company for several hundred computer
dealers and other industry insiders was a multimedia show in
itself.
   As the lights dimmed in the basketball stadium where the group
assembled, smoke filled the air and a green laser streaked across
the ceiling. Then, from the stadium's balcony, an inflated IBM
``spaceship'' the size of a small car floated across the ceiling
and hovered above a stage.
   The ship sent down a ``transporter'' signal modeled after TV's
``Star Trek,'' and an IBM executive appeared in the mist to the
sound of eerie music. Meanwhile, outer-space scenes flashed on
giant screens.
   IBM later demonstrated a more practical use for multimedia with
a computer program that spiced up a high school English lesson on
the poem ``Ulysses.''
   On a computer screen it depicted the text of the poem along with
a ``window'' featuring pictures of several actors. When an
on-screen arrow was moved to one of the photos, a video clip of the
actor reading the poem appeared in another window.
   The program also featured video clips of critics discussing the
poem and its historical background.
   Mike Braun, IBM's vice president for multimedia, called the
technology ``the next wave of the computer revolution.''
   ``It's technology that will push the computer into our everyday
lives,'' he said.
   IBM demonstrated another use of multimedia, a program that
electronically ``ages'' a person's photograph on the computer
screen. For this demonstration it used a photo of Bill Gates, the
35-year-old chairman of software giant Microsoft Corp., who
happened to be in the audience.
   IBM said the program is designed for law-enforcement authorities
to simulate the aging of a suspect or a missing child.
   At a Comdex panel discussion on multimedia, industry officials
listed a number of current and future uses for the technology,
including corporate training programs, point-of-sale merchandise
displays, education programs and entertainment.
   ``Some people learn better visually,'' said Nick Arnett, editor
of an industry newsletter on multimedia.
   The panelists showed videotapes depicting several uses of
multimedia. In one, used by Volvo dealers, a customer can see
combinations of colors and wheel covers on a car depicted on a
computer screen.
   In a program for interior designers, the color scheme of a room
can be altered on a screen, the furniture moved around and even the
effects of various types of lighting can be depicted.
   A third demonstration showed how a magazine could be represented
in multimedia. The magazine's pages could be ``turned'' on screen,
the articles could be read by a narrator and photographs and
graphics could be enlarged or rotated. This electronic ``magazine''
also could highlight key words and provide an outline of the
articles.
   ``What we're allowing the reader to do is get into that
magazine,'' said John Colligan, president of Authorware, a maker of
multimedia software.
   But despite multimedia's promise, even those involved in it
admit the market has yet to find its place or to earn much money.
   ``Right now it's a lot of effort but not much return,'' said
William Nisen, president of OWL International, another company
developing multimedia software.
   A key to multimedia's popularity could be the development of
long-promised high-definition television, Nisen said. That would
allow vastly sharper images and compact-disc-quality sound on TV
sets.
   If those future TVs also are based on digital technology rather
than today's analog, multimedia would get a further boost because a
digital TV essentially would be a computer, said Richard Shaffer,
editor of Technologic Computer Letter, an industry newsletter.
   In a telephone interview, Shaffer said computer companies are
being driven toward multimedia by the fear that as computer
technology becomes cheaper, they could lose the emerging home
computer market to consumer electronics companies.
   With multimedia, computer makers hope to stake their claim in
any home entertainment and information market that will be based on
multimedia, he said.
   ``The potential for an entertainment medium is enormous,'' he
said.

Future</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Casino executives and politicians are
touting Atlantic City as a good place to do business in spite of
the financial troubles facing Donald Trump and the resort's dozen
casinos.
   They also said Trump's bartering on an overdue $47 million bond
payment underscores the overdependence on junk bonds -
high-interest paying notes - in a weak economy that witnessed the
collapse of the 1980s junk bond market.
   ``I think Atlantic City is a good place to invest in right
now,'' said state Sen. William Gormley. ``Nobody said it was going
to happen overnight. It does take decades.''
   ``If what had happened were isolated to Atlantic City, you would
have to rethink where we are going,'' said Mayor Jim Whelan. ``This
is a problem that is national and international.''
   Whelan said the city would recover when the economy improves and
that in preparation it must repair its tattered image. But any
indication of an economic upturn seems a long way off.
   Atlantic City has 12 casinos, and no new gambling halls are in
the planning.
   The last one to open - the Trump Taj Mahal on April 2 - reached
an agreement Friday to restructure the $675 million in notes on
which an interest payment was due Thursday.
   Trump's deal with investors of the mammoth casino will briefly
put it under bankruptcy-court protection and give them a 50 percent
stake. The deal also allows Trump to remain as chairman.
   ``The concept of junk-bond financing included the knowledge that
junk bond financing was always present,'' said Ed Tracy, director
of Trump's three Atlantic City casinos and one non-casino hotel.
   ``Unfortunately today that isn't true ... You can't boil it down
and say the Taj Mahal was a huge mistake.
   ``It can weather a bad economy for a long period of time,'' said
Tracy, who said the upcoming year would prove difficult for each of
the city's 12 casinos.
   The industry, which according to state figures is saddled with
more than $3 billion in debt, is working to repay it at a time when
the casinos have posted flat numbers all year. The poor showing is
partly due to a declining economy and gamblers' weariness with the
resort, analysts say.
   But several casino officials said the city would rise above its
troubled present and enjoy a prosperous future.
   Thomas Carver, president of the Casino Association of New
Jersey, said the industry and city are experiencing tough times,
but would survive. He reiterated his belief that an expanded
airport would broaden the city's base.
   Since taking office in January, Gov. Jim Florio and his staff
have promised to help strengthen the casinos. Florio has said he is
committed to upgrading Atlantic City International Airport to bring
more air passengers to the resort.
   ``We can accomplish so much. We're in our embryonic stage,''
Carver said. ``Twelve years is not a long period of time.''

   Donald Trump and investors in his Taj Mahal
casino agreed Friday to a restructuring of the gambling parlor's
debt that will briefly put it under bankruptcy-court protection and
give bondholders half ownership of the glitzy Atlantic City
property.
   Some details of the arrangement were still to be worked out, but
bondholder representatives said it contained several incentives for
Trump to improve the performance of the Taj Mahal, which has been
unable to break even since its April 2 opening. The deal was
reached more than 12 hours after Trump missed a $47.3 million
interest payment on $675 million worth of high-yield junk bonds
used to finance the Taj Mahal.

   The Manville trust fund will make staggered
payments to victims of asbestos diseases based on severity of
illness under a tentative settlement of tens of thousands of claims
nationwide, lawyers said.
   The agreement, announced Friday and expected to be completed
over the weekend, would mark a major breakthrough in a
two-decade-old effort to compensate workers made sick by inhaling
asbestos fibers in products made by U.S. companies. The deal would
have to be approved by U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein, who
earlier this year ordered the Manville trust overhauled. The trust
has 130,000 claims pending.

   Consumer inflation slowed slightly in October
and the country's trade deficit narrowed, but economists attributed
these seemingly upbeat developments to the near certainty that the
nation has slid into a recession.
   Also on Friday, President Bush wrapped up a week of hastily
called meetings with his economic advisers and leading U.S.
business executives as the administration scoured for ways to
alleviate the pain from any economic downturn. Bush received a
generally bleak assessment of the economy's prospects from the
executives, leading the president to acknowledge the possibility of
a recession for the first time.

   CBS' ``60 Minutes'' will fire three producers at
year's end, and ABC News will close its Frankfurt, Germany, bureau
and three Central American offices, network officials said.
   CBS will make the ``60 Minutes'' cuts to restructure the
top-rated series' staff, not because of economic conditions that
have forced what the network calls ``a belt-tightening'' in its
news division, a spokesman said Friday.
   The move was ordered after Harry Reasoner, one of the show's
first correspondents, announced he would reduce his workload, said

   Phone company stocks took a pounding after MCI
Communications Corp. said its financial performance could falter
due to stepped-up competition from AT&amp;T, the economic slump, a
cost-cutting program and a recent acquisition.
   The decline on Friday was accelerated by a number of Wall Street
stock analysts, who lowered their earnings forecasts for the
nation's No. 2 long-distance phone company. MCI stock lost more
than a quarter of its value. Though the news appeared to favor
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., the stock price of the dominant
long-distance company also suffered.

<HEAD>Trump Casinos Post Third-Quarter Results; Taj Mahal Loses $11
Million</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump's three casinos posted
mixed numbers in the third quarter with the Taj Mahal losing $11
million, Trump officials said Friday.
   The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino posted a net gain while Trump
Castle Casino Resort By the Bay recorded a net loss in figures
submitted to the state Casino Control Commission, said a financial
source in the Trump Organization.
   The Taj Mahal recorded revenues of $128.46 million and a net
loss of $11.04 million, the source said.
   The third-quarter results come the same day Trump and
bondholders in the Taj Mahal reached a restructuring agreement that
will briefly put Atlantic City's largest casino under bankruptcy
court protection.
   The bondholders will receive 50 percent ownership and reduced
interest payments.
   Trump missed a $47.3 million interest payment Thursday on $675
million worth of high-yield junk bonds used to finance the gaming
hall.
   The Taj Mahal made an average $1.4 million a day in gross
revenues for the quarter, about the amount that analysts said it
needed to break even. But the casino's gross operating profits were
dragged down by $26.51 million in interest expense.
   The April 2 opening of the casino also drew business from
Trump's other two properties and the other nine casinos in the
city.
   Trump Castle Casino Resort recorded a net loss of $7.72 million
on total revenues of $69.03 million for the three-month period
ended Sept. 30.
   Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino recorded a net profit of $5.44
million on net revenues for the three months of $82.96 million.
