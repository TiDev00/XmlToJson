   To his followers, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was a living,
breathing symbol of Panamanian nationalism _ a brave David standing
firm against the imperialist Goliath of Washington.
    His detractors viewed Panama's supreme leader as an
unscrupulous despot who stood ready to drag the country down with
him.
   As far as the White House is concerned, Noriega is a criminal, a
man who enriched himself by selling his country to Colombian drug
traffickers.
   Noriega was indicted on U.S. drug-trafficking and
money-laundering charges in February 1988. He denied the charges.
   Washington imposed sanctions against Panama in its efforts to
dislodge the general from power.
   Noriega, in command since 1983 to the bane of two U.S.
presidents, wouldn't budge.
   As unemployment rose, food lines lengthened and hundreds of
business people declared bankruptcy, the general stood fast.
   He had a whipping boy, the United States, which he could blame
for all of Panama's ills. The indictments, the sanctions were all
part of a U.S. plot to renege on a 1978 treaty granting Panama
sovereignty over the canal by the year 2000, he said.
   His face contorted, Noriega brandished a machete above his head,
then brought it crashing down on the podium in front of him.
   ``Ni un paso atras!'' he shouted, and his friendly audience, on
its feet now, took up the chant: ``Ni un paso atras! Ni un paso
atras!''
   The Spanish words mean ``not one step back'' and long before
that speech on May 1, 1988, on International Labor Day, they had
become Noriega's rallying cry in his struggle to retain power.
   He reveled in thumbing his nose at the United States, which he
called ``the colossus of the north.''
   When elections apparently were going against him in May 1989, he
abruptly had them annulled. For a time he had his own hand-picked
man as provisional president.
   On Dec. 15, less than a week before his world was to come
crashing down, his rubber-stamp assembly named his chief of
government. That formally gave Noriega civilian powers to go with
the military clout he had long possessed, and which made him the
most powerful man in Panama.
   The assembly said his leadership was needed to confront a
``state of war'' caused by U.S. sanctions and other efforts to
drive out Noriega.
   On Dec. 20, shortly after incidents in which a U.S. Marine
lieutenant was killed and in which, according to President Bush, a
U.S. Navy couple was abused, U.S. troops invaded Panama and Noriega
fled into hiding.
   On Christmas Eve, the former strongman sought sanctuary in the
Vatican embassy _ sanctuary he finally yielded late Wednesday.
   The general was a shrewd, tough child of poverty, schooled in
intrigue. His foes in the military tried coups against him and
failed. The last attempt was last Oct. 3. The leaders were executed.
   Noriega was born in Panama City's El Chorrillo district and
raised by foster parents. His official biography indicates he is
about 51, but the date in his high school yearbook would make him
54. He joined the Defense Forces in 1962.
   He became head of the Defense Forces, chief of Panama's military
and police, through his loyalty to his predecessor and mentor, Gen.
Omar Torrijos. Noriega, a short, jowly, pockmarked man called
``pineapple face'' by his detractors, never possessed the charisma
of his populist mentor, but he was backed by the Democratic
Republican Party, which Torrijos founded.
   Noriega had little faith in the ability of civilians to rule.
    ``Our young officers are much better prepared to govern when
Panama takes over the (Panama) Canal operations in the year 2000,''
he once said in an interview.
   
   The handsome, charismatic Torrijos changed the Defense Forces
from an organization led by the social elite into a tightly
disciplined force of 15,000 with absolute police, military and
political power.
   He opened the upper ranks to the lower economic classes and
created a base of power from a new generation of officers. Noriega,
a poor boy who went to military school in Peru on a scholarship,
was among them.
   Less than a year after taking power in a coup in 1968, Torrijos
made Noriega, an obscure provincial lieutenant with only four years
of military service, his chief of intelligence.
   Noriega quickly began collecting dossiers on everyone who
counted in Panama, friends and enemies alike. He developed close
ties with U.S. intelligence agencies interested in any potential
threat to the security of the Panama Canal, a major shipping link
between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
   
   Torrijos also gave Noriega jurisdiction over customs and
immigration, long a source of funds for the military.
   
   After Torrijos died in an unexplained plane crash in 1981, it
took Noriega about two years to shoulder his way to the top
command. Once there, Noriega boldly exercised his power and
tolerated little opposition.
   He closed the private news media for months at a time for
alleged offenses ranging from personal insults to incitment to
disobedience. Unhappy with the outcome of the first popular
election in 16 years, Noriega installed his own president in 1984.
   He was long the ally of the United States, but Washington began
to distance itself from him after the headless body of a Noriega
foe, Hugh Spadadora, was found in a U.S. mailbag in Costa Rica in
1985. The final break came three years later with the U.S. grand
jury drug indictments in Florida.
   Noriega worked hard to develop the image of a man of the people.
His private life was that of a rich man, but publicly he stressed
his humble origins and spent weekends courting the residents of
rural towns and villages.
   With the deepening of his political crisis, Noriega tried to use
his popular image to build support in this nation of 2.2 million
people, many of them black and mulatto.
   
   ``The humble, the poor, the blacks, they are the utmost
authority of this people,'' he said in one speech.
   
   His official salary was $60,000 a year but in addition to drug
smuggling, he was said to have his finger in a wide range of
enterprises. Among them were duty-free liquor stores, maritime
services, banks, gambling casinos, newspapers, a television station
and 12 radio stations. He lived in a two-story, colonial-style
mansion in one of Panama's most exclusive neighborhoods and
maintained a fleet of expensive cars.
   Noriega is married and has three children, including a daughter
who lives in the Dominican Republic.

   Panamanians hugged American soldiers
and danced in the streets as fireworks burst in the the sky
Wednesday night when word spread that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
had surrendered to U.S. troops.
   ``Thank God. Panama can now feel like a free country. I feel
free now,'' said 20-year-old Moises Rios.
   Sheer jubilation gripped the capital of 1 million residents just
seconds after radio and television announced the former strongman
had abandoned his Vatican Embassy sanctuary after a 10-day siege.
   ``Is it official? Is he really gone?'' many disbelievers asked
reporters.
   Panamanians spilled into the streets, laughing, banging pots and
pans and applauding. Hundreds converged on Avenida Balboa, where
the Vatican mission was framed in a burst of fireworks.
   ``It's over! It's over!'' people shouted, some screaming
themselves hoarse.
   Cars careened down streets and boulevards, blaring their horns
and causing traffic jams more mindful of rush hour than a national
celebration. Residents ran up to the U.S. military roadblocks and
hugged and kissed U.S. soldiers.
   ``We are relieved to be rid of this criminal. The important
thing was that he should leave our national territory. It's a great
moment,'' said President Guillermo Endara. ``We have to feel happy.
God has blessed us in these last few days.''
   Groups of youngsters ran up and down neighborhood streets waving
Panamanian and American flags. Vatican Embassy officials said
Noriega left the compound ``of his own will'' and was dressed in
his general's uniform.
   He was flown off in an Army helicopter to Florida, where he
faces drug trafficking charges.

   An 82-year-old man shot two sheriff's
deputies to death in the back of the head Tuesday as they gave him
a ride after he had been in a car crash, authorities said.
   Ule Reynolds of Gary, Ind., who has a criminal record dating
back 45 years, was being held without bond on two first-degree
murder charges late Tuesday in the jail in neighboring Tipton
County. Police also were investigating weapons charges.
   ``We do this all the time _ give people a ride who have
trouble,'' said Lauderdale County Deputy Sheriff Bill Danley. ``He
was not under arrest. They were just giving him a ride.''
   Police planned to interview Reynolds Wednesday, said Sheriff
Milford Durham. ``We tried to talk to him today and we couldn't
make any sense out of what he was saying,'' he said.
   ``We transferred him to Tipton for both his protection and
ours,'' Durham said. ``There are bad feelings about this.''
   Reynolds' car had run into a ditch off state Highway 51 about 60
miles north of Memphis early Tuesday morning.
   The slain deputies, Kevin Ward, 29, and Bobby Nolen, 55,
apparently felt no reason to check the man for a weapon before
giving him the ride since he was not suspected of any criminal
activity, Durham said.
   Reynolds carried a .357-caliber pistol in a shoulder holster,
investigators said.
   ``He was sitting on it when police arrived,'' Danley said. ``He
was unconscious at first, and then he came to. The officers said he
was real quiet and never said a word.''
   There was no sign of a struggle, but Reynolds injured a shoulder
when the police car ran off the state highway, authorities said. He
was treated at Regional Medical Center in Memphis before his arrest.
   A passerby who noticed the wrecked cruiser alerted police to the
shootings.
   ``We're all stunned,'' said Ann Smith, city recorder of Gates, a
town of 700 people about 60 miles north of Memphis where Nolen was
elected to a two-year term as mayor in June. ``It's tragic that
anything like this could happen to two good friends of ours.''
   The sheriff said alcohol tests on Reynolds were negative but
results of drug tests were not yet available.
   Reynolds was convicted in 1945 of assault, according to Indiana
police records.
   In May 1975, he pleaded guilty to three counts of possession of
a firearm by a felon. Those charges stem from his arrest in
February 1975, when he was charged with attempting to obstruct
justice in connection with a federal drug conspiracy trial. At the
time of that arrest, Reynolds was armed with a handgun and had two
others nearby, records show.

<HEAD>Surveys Prompt FDA to Test Milk in 13 Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is concerned
that two independent surveys found milk supplies in several areas
contaminated with potentially harmful drugs, but the government
says it sees no public health threat.
   The FDA is testing retail milk supplies in 13 cities in response
to the surveys by The Wall Street Journal and the Center for
Science in the Public Interest that found some samples were tainted
with veterinary drugs.
   The testing should be completed within two to three weeks and
the results will be made public, FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said
Tuesday.
   The FDA said that although it ``is concerned that these
unconfirmed findings may indicate violative drug residues in
milk,'' it sees ``no public health threat associated with animal
drug residues in milk at the levels reported by The Wall Street
Journal.''
   But Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, said the general presence of sulfa
drugs and antibiotics in milk samples is disturbing.
   ``People should be angry that the government hasn't ensured the
safety of the milk supply,'' he said. ``People should continue
drinking milk _ while they write a letter to their legislators
demanding action.''
   The Journal's survey, reported Friday, found that of 50 retail
samples collected in 10 major cities, 38 percent were contaminated
with antibiotics and sulfa drugs used to treat sick cattle. The
newspaper said the most troubling in that class of drugs is
sulfamethazine, a suspected carcinogen.
   Another survey last week by the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, conducted in conjunction with the Journal, tested 20 milk
samples from store shelves in metropolitan Washington and found 20
percent were tainted.
   Nesbit noted the test both surveys used, called Charm II, can
detect the presence of the class of drugs known as sulfonamides,
but that further testing is required to identify which sulfa drug
is present.
   Neither survey did further testing to confirm the presence of
sulfamethazine, he said.
   Jacobson said, ``This is just the tip of the iceberg'' because
tests do not exist to detect many other drugs used by farmers. He
said the test used by most states for testing milk can detect
penicillin but not other antibiotics.
   The FDA last year revised labeling for sulfamethazine to warn
farmers and veterinarians against using it in lactating dairy cows
because of recent studies finding that at high levels it can cause
tumors in mice and rats.
   In 1988, the FDA tested retail milk supplies in 10 cities and
found sulfamethazine in five of 49 samples at more than the
allowable limit of 10 parts per billion.
   In response, the FDA launched a nationwide education program to
alert state and industry officials to the problem. The FDA also
created a federal milk-testing program in cooperation with the
Environmental Protection Agency, which is in addition to state and
industry testing programs.
   In announcing the 13-city milk survey, the FDA said ``dairy
farmers must ... take responsibility for avoiding use of
sulfamethazine, the drug found which is not approved for dairy
cows.''
   ``A lapse in which a farmer treats even a single cow can
contaminate the milk, when pooled, of 70,000 cows,'' the FDA said.
   The 13 cities where milk is being tested are: Boston, New York,
Philadelphia, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Kansas
City, Denver, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.

   The government says Peruvians had to cope with
2,775 percent inflation last year, the second-highest inflation
rate in Latin America and about half the expected yearly figure for
Argentina.
   The figure was released Tuesday by the National Statistics
Institute.
   Brazil and Nicaragua, two other countries that battled
hyperinflation last year, had annual rates of 1,765 percent and
1,500 percent, respectively.
   Argentina's 1989 inflation rate is expected to be about 5,000
percent.
   In June, the Peruvian government began a series of daily
devaluations of the country's currency, the inti, against the
dollar to stabilize exchange rates and slow inflation.
   The government raised the daily devaluations in November after a
dramatic rise in the black market exhange rate pushed the price of
the dollar past 14,000 intis.
   The black market exchange rate remained stable in December,
closing the year at 13,600 intis to the dollar. The official
exchange rate Tuesday was 5,261 intis to the dollar.
   Peru's 1988 inflation rate was 1,722 percent.

   Redoubt Volcano blew its top again
Tuesday and scientists said the eruption appeared to be larger than
those that occurred in December after the volcano emerged from a
25-year sleep.
   A pilot reported seeing ``lightning and fireworks'' and a plume
as high as 40,000 feet after the eruption occurred about 6 p.m.,
said David Stone, a geophysicist with the Alaska Volcano
Observatory in Fairbanks.
   Several pilots reported lava was flowing down the northwest
flank of the mountain 115 miles southwest of Anchorage, said
geologist Robert McGimsey of the Alaska Volcano Observatory in
Anchorage.
   McGimsey said it was possible the flow was actually a mixture of
ash and hot gas rather than lava. He said scientists would have to
wait until daylight to investigate.
   The volcano spewed an ``extensive ash plume,'' and it appeared
the ash generally remained in the area of Redoubt, McGimsey said.
Light winds blowing toward Anchorage were expected to shift
slightly to the south overnight, the National Weather Service said.
   Monitoring equipment on the volcano and elsewhere indicated a
strong eruption, Stone said.
   ``Normally, these things go on for some time, a matter of hours
or a day,'' Stone said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration advised pilots to
``continually evaluate operations to and from Anchorage.'' At least
one plane, a Delta Airlines flight scheduled from Seattle to
Anchorage, turned back after the pilot announced that the plume was
headed for Anchorage.
   Scientists have been monitoring the volcano around the clock.
After resting for a quarter of a century, the peak erupted Dec. 13
and spewed ash 33,000 feet into the air the next day. Varying
levels of seismic activity continued through the month.
   During last month's eruption, Christmas travelers and mail were
delayed and Anchorage air traffic slowed to a trickle after a KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines Boeing 747 flew through ash, lost power to all
four engines and fell more than two miles. The plane made a safe
emergency landing after the engines were restarted.
   ``The seismicity is high enough that if the thing blew a plume
we wouldn't be surprised,'' McGimsey said Tuesday morning before
the second eruption.
   McGimsey said there was an increase in shallow earthquakes in
the volcano dome. More temblors occurred seven to 10 kilometers
beneath the 10,197-foot peak 115 miles southwest of Anchorage, he
said.
   ``And there were a couple of energetic pulses yesterday evening
and early this morning,'' McGimsey said. Those were strong enough
to have been felt on seismic instruments at Mount Spurr, some 80
miles to the northeast.
   The habitation nearest the volcano, the Drift River oil storage
facility 20 miles away, had been evacuated before the eruption, the
Alaska Division of Emergency Services said. About 11 people usually
are assigned to the facility.

<HEAD>Rep. Robert Garcia Will Quit Congress Before Wedtech Sentencing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., who faces up to 45
years in prison when he is sentenced on his Wedtech extortion
conviction, will resign Sunday to give voters time to choose a
successor, a spokesman says.
   ``Clearly, he wants to be done with this now so that they can
prepare to have a special election,'' Garcia spokesman Ron
Simoncini said Tuesday. ``It may not be the last possible moment
but ... he views this as the time to do it.''
   Garcia's office issued a statement Tuesday saying he will quit
his House seat effective Sunday. The 56-year-old congressman and
his wife, Jane Lee Garcia, 48, were convicted in October of
extorting $178,500 in cash, loans and jewelry from the Wedtech
Corp., a now-defunct defense contractor based in Garcia's South
Bronx district.
   Sentencing is set for Jan. 19. The Garcias face up to 45 years
each in prison and $750,000 in fines. In addition, the congressman
is under investigation by the House ethics committee, although that
probe will become moot once he quits.
   Simoncini said Garcia was not seeking to time his resignation to
influence the judge to be lenient.
   ``He said he didn't know how that was going to affect the judge,
one way or the other,'' Simoncini said in an interview from New
York.
   Garcia was vacationing with his family in Florida and would not
speak to reporters, Simoncini said.
   In a statement, Garcia said it was ``with great sadness'' that
he decided to resign.
   ``The people of the Bronx have always been the most important
part of my life, and representing them is the greatest honor I
could ever know,'' he said. ``But I have always said that if I
could not serve their best interests I would leave office.''
   ``Vacating my seat now allows Governor (Mario) Cuomo to call for
a special election in time for the people of the Bronx to choose a
new member of Congress to serve out this term,'' Garcia said.
   In resigning, Garcia follows the example of fellow Bronx
Democrat Mario Biaggi, who gave up his seat in August 1988 after
convictions in the Wedtech and Coastal Dry Dock cases. Biaggi is
serving an eight-year prison term.
   A handful of Democrats have lined up to seek Garcia's seat but
Bronx Democratic leaders have privately said state Assemblyman Jose
Serrano is the likely successor. The district is overwhelmingly
Democratic, and whoever gets the party's endorsement would be the
clear front-runner.
   Other possible candidates include Pedro Espada, who ran against
Garcia in the 1988 primary, and also lost races recently for New
York City Council and Bronx borough president; Assemblywoman Gloria
Davis; and state Sen. Olga Mendez. All are Democrats.
   Garcia, the only mainland-born Puerto Rican ever elected to
Congress, won his seat in 1978 in a special election after Rep.
Herman Badillo resigned to become a deputy New York City mayor.
   In Congress, Garcia gained a reputation as an articulate and
enthusiastic legislator. But his best-known piece of legislation _
a bill to create federal tax-exempt enterprise zones to attract
business to inner cities _ has never passed, despite the
cosponsorship of then-Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.
   Nevertheless, the concept of giving tax breaks to developers of
decaying neighborhoods has been adopted in some states. And Kemp,
now secretary of Housing and Urban Development, continues to push
for federal legislation.
   Garcia was chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus from
1978 to 1982, and chairman of the Post Office and Civil Service
subcommittee responsible for oversight of the census, where he
sought adjustments for undercounting.
   The son of a Pentecostal minister, Garcia grew up in the Bronx,
went to public schools there and served in the Army infantry in
Korea. He later attended City College and New York Community
College but did not graduate. He worked for eight years as a
computer programmer before running for the New York State Assembly,
where he served two terms.

   Two co-defendants of Gen. Manuel Noriega appeared
in court Tuesday to answer drug charges, but both of their
attorneys challenged the federal government's right to extradite
them from Panama.
   Daniel Miranda, 36, gave only his name and age through an
interpreter to a federal magistrate. His attorney, Michael O'Kane
of Fort Lauderdale, then said he would remain mute throughout the
proceeding.
   ``This is a violation of the Panama Canal Treaty,'' the seasoned
criminal attorney said. ``It says that if there are any criminal
acts, the defendant would be turned over to Panamanian authorities
and not surrendered to the United States.''
   In another courtroom, Luis del Cid, a man prosecutors have
referred to as Noriega's ``right hand man,'' had his pre-trial
detention hearing continued until Jan. 16 so his attorneys could
bring in witnesses from Panama.
   ``As much as American citizens might like to see justice done to
criminals all over the world, the United States is not an
international police force,'' del Cid's lawyer, Samuel Burstyn,
said outside the courtroom. ``The United States just can't go out
and invade other countries and arrest whomever it wants.''
   Del Cid has been held in Miami since he was captured by U.S.
special forces troops in Panama's northern Cheriqui province on
Christmas Eve and flown to Florida the next day.
   Both men were named in the 12-count indictment handed up
February 1988 in Miami that also accuses Noriega, Medellin cartel
leader Pablo Escobar and 11 others of running drugs and using
Panama as a safe haven.
   U.S. prosecutors say Noriega accepted millions of dollars in
bribes in exchange for allowing the cartel to launder money and
process and ship drugs through Panama to the United States.
   Miranda was arrested by U.S. military personnel and Drug
Enforcement Administration agents during a 6 a.m. raid on his
Panama City apartment on Sunday, and escorted to Miami the next
day. On Tuesday, he wore a headset and occasionally nodded his head
as he listened to the hearing in Spanish.
   He is accused of flying an airplane from Fort Lauderdale to
Panama in May 1983 with $800,000 of drug money on board. If
convicted, Miranda faces up to five years in prison and $10,000 in
fines.
   In contrast, Noriega would face up to 145 years in prison and
more than $1 million in fines if brought to Miami and convicted on
all drug trafficking charges.
   U.S. Magistrate Peter Palermo entered a plea of not guilty for
Miranda and ordered him held until a pre-trial detention hearing
Friday after U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen personally requested
that Miranda be held without bond.
   Miranda's attorney objected in vain to the government's request.
   ``There is no reason for that,'' O'Kane said. ``There are many
people accused of crimes ten times worse and they get bond.''
   Outside the court, O'Kane said the government violated a U.S.
law that forbids the military from making arrests in foreign
countries for criminal violations and that Miranda should not have
been turned over to the DEA.
   Meanwhile Tuesday, del Cid's attorneys, Burstyn and assistant
federal public defender Kenneth Swartz, said they needed more time
to bring members of the defendant's family and Panamanian military
figures to the hearing.
   ``We want to put on witnesses who would contradict what the
government has proffered,'' Burstyn told U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler.
   The attorneys also objected to the way del Cid was brought to
the United States.
   Del Cid, 46, was arrested by DEA agents on Christmas Day in
Panama after surrendering to U.S. forces. The indictment said he
acted as a liaison and money courier between drug traffickers and
Noriega.
   ``The government has violated the Geneva Convention,'' Burstyn
said. ``Once he surrendered in Panama, he can not be transferred to
this country.''
   Del Cid, a commander in the Panamanian Defense Forces, faces
racketeering, drug smuggling and money-laundering charges which
carry a maximum penalty of 70 years in prison and $550,000 in fines.
   Outside the courtroom, Burstyn and Swartz said they expect to
bring five witnesses from Panama and bring in testimony obtained
through polygraph tests.
   Two other minor defendants, Brian Alden Davidow and William
Saldarriaga, are also awaiting trial in Miami. Davidow is an
alleged cocaine distributor in Miami and Saldarriaga is an alleged
Colombian cocaine trafficker.
   The other eleven men named in the indictment are still at large.
Noriega remained at the Vatican embassy in Panama City Tuesday,
after seeking asylum there on Dec. 24.
   Noriega has also been indicted by a federal grand jury in Tampa
on charges of taking a $5.4 million bribe from the Colombian drug
cartel. But the Justice Department has said if Noriega is brought
to the United States, he would first be tried by Miami prosecutors
who have a stronger case against him.

   The government is effectively slapping ``For
Sale'' signs on 30,123 real estate properties owned by bankrupt
savings and loan associations in 35 states.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., created Aug. 9 by S&amp;L bailout
legislation, on Tuesday issued a four-volume, 3,000-page, 10-pound
inventory of what it's offering. The vast majority of the parcels
are residential _ 26,813 _ and 11,918 of those are single-family
homes.
   It's a diverse list with properties ranging from a Dairy Queen
in Woodland Park, Colo., to a golf course on South Padre Island,
Texas. The government has nursing homes, theaters, condos, marinas,
churches and single-family homes _ all available for a price.
   And the government wants to sell. The sooner it gets rid of the
properties, the sooner it has additional cash to dispose of more
bankrupt thrift institutions.
   In a strategic plan scheduled for release today, an
administration oversight board led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
F. Brady urges the RTC to sell the real estate even before it sells
the S&amp;Ls that own the property, according to a copy obtained
earlier by The Associated Press.
   Maine, Vermont, West Virginia and North and South Dakota are the
only states without property listed. But, as expected, most of the
properties _ 15,750 _ are in Texas, where the RTC has seized 90
bankrupt S&amp;Ls. More than half of the single-family homes _ 6,259 _
are in Texas.
   The hefty RTC volumes are actually just a shadow of what's to
come. The list will be updated every six months.
   The first version includes properties of the 283 S&amp;Ls seized by
Sept. 30. As of Dec. 31, the agency had taken over 318 institutions
and S&amp;L regulators were expected to turn over more than 200 others
this year.
   Public interest in the properties has been enormous. The RTC
says it received more than 22,000 written inquiries before it
stopped counting.
   The list is split into four sections: single-family homes,
multi-family residential, commercial and land. The residential
sections are available for $15 each and the land and commercial
sections for $10 each. The whole package costs $50 and can be
ordered by calling 1-800-431-0600.
   The lists also are being distributed to 1,400 libraries across
the country. Callers can get the name of the nearest library by
calling the 800 number.
   The amount of information offered is far sketchier than a
typical real estate advertisement. An office listing may include
only the property's address, acreage and whether the building is
more or less than 100,000 square feet. Some are listed with real
estate agents, some aren't.
   A typical single-family home listing includes more: address,
square footage, type of construction, total rooms, number of
bedrooms and baths, condition, asking price and real estate agent.

   AIDS victim Ryan White has recently suffered
a string of physical ailments, but a New Year's holiday with pop
singer Michael Jackson took his mind off his pain.
   His mother, Jeanne White, said her son rested and watched movies
at Jackson's Santa Barbara County, Calif., ranch from Thursday
until Tuesday.
   ``They've had a really good time,'' Mrs. White said.
   White, 18, recently has suffered infections, a low-platelet
count, a hernia, a protein deficiency and fluid retention.
   White, a hemophiliac, contracted acquired immune deficiency
syndrome from a blood transfusion. Four years ago, he was barred
from attending Western Middle School near Kokomo by officials who
feared the AIDS could be transmitted to other students.
   A judge ruled that Ryan should be allowed in school because the
disease can not be transmitted through casual contact. Since then,
the Whites have moved to Cicero, a town about 25 miles northeast of
Indianapolis, where Ryan attends high school.

   Jacques Cousteau and son Jean-Michel will lead
an Antarctic expedition this week with six children representing
the world's other continents.
   The 79-year-old Cousteau, an ocean explorer known for his
television specials and environmental activism, is promoting a
French-Australian proposal to make Antarctica a nature reserve.
   The United States and Britain oppose the proposal, urging
support instead for an international minerals treaty that would
permit regulated mining.
   The expedition was scheduled to sail today from Punta Arenas,
Chile, and arrive in Antarctica on Saturday, weather permitting.
   Jean-Michel Cousteau, who was in New York on Tuesday, was to fly
to Antarctica later and catch up with the group.
   Divers will film the wreck of an Argentine supply ship, which
spilled more than 70,000 gallons of diesel fuel into one of world's
most delicate ecosystems since running aground early last year near
the U.S. Palmer Station.
   ``We are going on behalf of the generations to come _ the
children of tomorrow,'' Jean-Michel Cousteau said. ``We decided to
have them step on this virgin land, as big as the continental
United States, and have them realize it will be their
responsibility to either care for it or exploit it.''
   The children are: Cory Gillmer, 12, a sixth grader at Seatack
Elementary School in Virginia Beach, Va., representing North
America; Jeronimo Brunner, 11, of Santiago, Chile, representing
South America; Kelly Jean Matheson of Hobart, Australia, a
fifth-grader whose age was not given; Fumiko Matsumoto, 11, of
Hamamatsu, Japan, representing Asia; Elise Otzenberger, 11, of
Paris, representing Europe; and Oko Joseph Shio, 12, of Tanzania,
representing Africa.

officials at the television station on which he will appear in a
weekly show.
   ``I'm having a ball,'' he said.
   There's no time for melancholy, said the 65-year-old Koch.
   ``Government's a wonderful thing to be a part of,'' said the
three-term mayor and five-term congressman. ``When you leave,
there's a hole in your life because it occupied so much of your
time.
   ``That's when people become despondent, a depression sets in.
But not with me, because I'm working the same number of hours as I

   Former President Reagan's attorneys are trying
to delay defense attempts to subpoena him as a witness at the
Iran-Contra trial of ex-national security adviser John M.
Poindexter.
   Reagan's lawyers called Poindexter's attempt to subpoena the
former president an unprecedented action that raises ``substantial
constitutional questions.''
   In court papers filed Tuesday, they urged U.S. District Judge
Harold Greene to postpone any decision on the subpoena until
prosecutors have rested their case in the trial, set to begin Feb.
20.
   The court filing also indicated that Reagan might invoke
executive privilege and refuse to answer questions about foreign
affairs or national security if he were forced to take the witness
stand at Poindexter's trial.
   Requiring a former president to testify about the Iran-Contra
affair might undermine relations with foreign countries and hurt
national security, the lawyers said.
   ``Relations and discussions with foreign governments are
apparently at the heart of many of the issues presented in the
case,'' the filing said. ``Answers required by the unforeseeable
questions of counsel might deal with the United States' contacts
with foreign governments and other entities abroad.''
   ``The spectacle of a former president being subjected to
preemptory judicial process may chill foreign governments in the
way they deal with the presidents now and in the future,'' Reagan's
lawyers said.
   Reagan would have a difficult, if not impossible job, of
protecting government secrets when asked about sensitive matters
while he is on the witness stand, the lawyers noted.
   ``Such determinations cannot be made instantaneously and without
the participation of the incumbent president,'' Reagan's lawyers
said.
   The Justice Department, in a separate filing, supported Reagan's
move to postpone any decision on the subpoena and expressed similar
concerns about forcing a former president to testify about the
conduct of his office.
   ``The precedent of the compelled testimony of a recent former
president necessarily will have a telling impact on the present and
future operation of the presidency,'' the Justice Department said.
``Both the president and his advisers will be substantially
inhibited if they know that this same president can later be
compelled to reveal the entire content of their conversations.''
   Reagan's lawyers said a decision to enforce the subpoena should
be made only after the prosecution rests its case because
Poindexter's need for the former president's testimony ``may be
very different at that point in the trial.''
   ``Evidence that he now believes to be central may prove to be
unnecessary,'' Reagan's lawyers said.
   They noted a similar procedure was followed in last year's
Iran-Contra trial of former White House aide Oliver North, who was
convicted of trying to cover up his involvement in the diversion of
U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The judge in North's case waited until prosecutors had completed
their case before denying the former National Security Council
aide's request to subpoena Reagan.
   Poindexter is accused of lying to Congress and obstructing
various congressional inquiries about the Iran-Contra affair.
   Defense filings in the case indicate Poindexter may try to
portray Reagan as a more active and informed participant in the
Iran-Contra affair than the president Poindexter described in his
1987 congressional testimony.
   As an alternative to requiring Reagan's testimony, attorneys for
the former president suggested he be allowed to respond in writing
to questions or testify during a videotaped deposition. The
videotape would then be played to jurors.

   William Roper, an adviser to President Bush on
health issues, will be named to head the federal Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta, according to a White House official.
   Roper, a White House adviser and chief of the Health Care
Financing Administration during the Reagan administration, returned
to the White House in February as deputy assistant to the president
for domestic policy.
   The CDC post has been vacant since James Mason left early last
year to become assistant secretary for health at the Department of
Health and Human Services, which oversees the Public Health
Service, including the CDC.
   Roper will start the CDC job in March, said Roger Porter, White
House domestic policy adviser and Roper's superior. The
appointment, which does not require Senate confirmation, was to be
announced soon by HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   ``He is an outstanding public servant. This will give him an
opportunity to contribute further in health policy issues,'' Porter
said Tuesday.
   The CDC is the federal government's lead agency for directing
the prevention and control of diseases and the nation's response to
public health emergencies.
   The agency has been the source and coordinator for the federally
sponsored public information and education programs on acquired
immune deficiency syndrome and tracks the spread of the AIDS
epidemic.
   Roper headed the HCFA, which oversees the Medicare and Medicaid
health care programs, from May 1986 until February. He was special
assistant to President Reagan for health policy from 1983-86 and a
White House fellow in 1982-83.
   Before that, Roper was health officer of the Jefferson County
Office of Health in Birmingham, Ala. At the time, he also served as
an assistant state health officer and was on the faculty of the
University of Alabama in Birmingham.
   Sullivan also is expected to announce shortly the appointment of
Robert G. Harmon, director of the Missouri health department, to
head the Health Resources and Services Administration, which is
also part of the Public Health Service, said an HHS source speaking
on the condition of anonymity.

   A yacht carrying 12 Americans and a crew
of four on a diving trip sank in the Gulf of California, and two
people were rescued after spending more than a day in the water,
port officials said Tuesday.
   The searched continued for the others.
   The Mexican-registered Santa Barbara sank about 3:30 a.m.
Monday, 2{ hours after leaving Isla Tortugas on the western side of
the gulf, port Capt. Joaquin Dorantes said.
   Authorities learned of the accident at 1 p.m. Tuesday after a
ferry on its regular run from Guaymas to Santa Rosalia picked up
one survivor, a Mexican crew member identified as Vicente Gonzalez
Mancilla.
   The surviving tourist, tentatively identified as Opram Watson,
told port officials the boat overturned and sank suddenly.
   ``They said when they found him he had a life jacket on and was
holding on to a door,'' Dorantes said.
   ``He said there were four other people holding on to the same
door with him but in the night he lost them.''
   The officials said the survivors were believed to be in good
condition.
   About 10 boats searched for other survivors Tuesday afternoon,
Dorantes said, but suspended the effort at dusk. No bodies had been
found, he said.
   Dorantes said his information came from radio communication with
a pleasure boat that picked up one of the survivors about 6 p.m.
Tuesday.
   He said airplanes were expected to join the search when it
resumed at dawn Wednesday.
   Dorantes and Capt. Roman Henchi of the 6th naval zone said the
cause of the accident was not known. But Andres Mladineo, an
engineer with the Guaymas port authority, said wind was believed to
be responsible.
   ``There was a little wind and the boat turned over,'' Mladineo
said.
   Isla Tortugas is about 60 miles southwest of Guaymas. Guaymas is
270 miles south of Tucson, Ariz., and 875 miles northwest of Mexico
City.

   Alligator owner and tavern proprietor James
Schebler says mascot Crosby is a real pussycat, but the City
Council refused to allow the bar to display the lounge lizard.
   ``There are a lot of dogs in town that are not maintained
properly and are more of a danger than Crosby. If you maintain an
animal properly, the danger is at a minimum,'' said Schebler, who
bought Crosby's Cove in Coggon four months ago and named it after
his pet alligator.
   Schebler wanted to keep the alligator, now 2 feet long, in the
eastern Iowa bar to attract customers.
   But the council Tuesday rejected Schebler's request that the
community's dangerous pets ordinance be amended to allow alligators
to be kept in the city as long as they are in a locked container.
   Mayor James Pflughaupt Jr. told Schebler that before he could
display the alligator in his bar, he would have to win a change in
a state law that bars animals in establishments that sell food or
drink.
   Meanwhile, other problems surfaced for the reptile. During the
council meeting, it was disclosed that Crosby is living in Cedar
Rapids, which also has a dangerous animal ordinance that bans
alligators within city limits.

   A radio station in this Gulf Coast city
has come up with a novel format and a catchy entry into the 1990s _
playing nothing but songs recorded by the defunct rock group Led
Zeppelin _ 24 hours a day.
   Beginning at the stroke of the new year, radio station WKRL-FM
has been calling itself: ``The first all-Led Zeppelin radio
station.''
   The station first confused listeners on Sunday, the last day of
1989, by playing only the 1971 Led Zeppelin song ``Stairway to
Heaven'' _ over and over for 24 hours.
   Before each playing of the song _ which is among the most
requested rock songs in radio _ the station repeatedly announced:
``It's coming tomorrow ... Your Stairway to Heaven station.''
   The change followed the station's purchase by Great American
Broadcasting Co.
   Led Zeppelin, a British group of the late 1960s and 1970s, fused
blues, country and heavy metal music with dark lyricism. The band
released 10 albums over 12 years. The foursome included lead singer
Robert Plant, Jimmy Page on guitar, John Paul Jones on bass and
keyboards and the late drummer John Bonham.

<HEAD>Presidential Panel Calls for Revamping Farm Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential commission is calling for more
flexible, market-oriented farm policies that would leave it up to
farmers to decide what crops to plant and how much but still
provide a ``safety net'' for hard times.
   ``The strength of U.S. agriculture depends on its ability to
compete in the domestic and international marketplace,'' says the
report released Tuesday by the National Commission on Agriculture
and Rural Development Policy.
   Recommendations ranging from more research to an end to
emergency disaster aid are contained in the report, ``Future
Directions in Agricultural Policy,'' produced by the 15-member
commission established by the 1985 farm act.
   Leading the list is a call for balancing the federal budget _
words that in the farm community are guaranteed to suggest cuts in
the payment programs that lifted American agriculture out of the
economic doldrums of the mid-1980s but at the cost of record
spending.
   Federal outlays for farm programs reached a record $25.8 billion
in fiscal 1986 but within two years fell to $12.5 billion. All the
same, they remain several times what they were a decade ago.
   ``Reducing the federal deficit to lower interest rates would
improve export competitiveness and reduce production costs,'' said
the commission.
   The commission said the nation needs a long-range plan for farm
policy. It said the blueprint should be consistent with any
agricultural agreement that emerges from current Uruguay Round
trade negotiations.
   If no such agreement emerges, it said, long-range planning is
still needed and should include an orderly transition away from
policies that make government programs a key factor in farmers'
decisions on what to plant and how much to produce.
   Farm lawmakers will take a fresh look at these programs as they
prepare to fashion a replacement for the soon-to-expire 1985 act.
Deficit cutters complain that major programs actually give the
lion's share of the benefits not to those who need the money but to
those financially and technologically geared up to bring in bumper
crops.
   That means bulging bins, which lowers prices and makes
government payments even more costly, say the critics.
   Congress already has taken some tentative steps away from the
link between payments from production. The commission's
recommendations give a boost to that concept and would represent a
sharp departure from existing major programs.
   ``The principal purpose of farm programs should be to stabilize
incomes _ to provide a safety net in times of low prices or
yields,'' the report said.
   The commission said the structure of farm programs has not kept
pace with economic, social and technological changes that have
swept rural America.
   ``Agriculture is now primarily a commercial activity managed by
highly skilled individuals, who, like other entrepreneurs, plan,
manage their resources in response to market opportunities, take
risks and accept the consequences _ both positive and negative,''
the report said.
   The report said government ``often inadvertently curtails
economic growth opportunities while, at the same time, stimulating
inefficient activities.''
   ``The economic vitality of many areas of production agriculture
would improve with a significant reduction in government
intervention,'' it said.
   To get into farm programs, it said, producers must often
restrict the acreage they plant. ``Since the incentives differ by
crop, government programs can have a significant effect on the mix
of crops produced and the amount,'' the report said. ``The result
may be inconsistent with the needs of domestic and foreign
consumers.''
   It said federal programs have indirectly encouraged farmers to
use greater amounts of pesticides and chemical fertilizers. ``The
environmental consequences of such programs are a growing concern.''
   Farm programs for major crops are frequently not a very good
remedy for financial problems, the report said. It said less than
10 percent of payments in 1988 went to farms considered
``financially vulnerable'' while about 60 percent went to farms
``with a favorable financial condition based on incomes and
debt-to-asset ratios.''
   About half of American agriculture gets no federal support. Such
producers ``develop sophisticated means to deal with price and
yield risks and promote and market their crops,'' it said. ``These
areas of agriculture are often the most competitive, both
domestically and internationally.''
   The report also said program costs are inflated because
government purchase prices for butter, cheese and non-fat dry milk
do not reflect consumer demand. It said the current system imposes
artificial barriers on the movement of milk supplies among the
regions of the country.
   It said acreage reduction and production control programs have
cut employment and investment in farming and related industries.

   Union officials say Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole should use the measures that helped achieve tentative
settlement of a lengthy coal strike to bring striking Machinists
together with Eastern Airlines.
   ``We're happy that our brothers and sisters have a tentative
agreement (in the coal strike), but as far as Eastern receiving
help from Liz Dole, we haven't seen or heard from her since the day
of the strike,'' Machinists spokesman James Conley said Tuesday.
   But Labor Department spokeswoman Johanna Schneider said
appointment of a special federal ``supermediator'' _ the move that
jumpstarted the coal talks _ is unlikely in the 10-month airline
strike.
   ``They're entirely different situations,'' said Schneider.
   ``It would not have been appropriate for Mrs. Dole to take the
same step'' in the Eastern strike, because President Bush decided
against naming an emergency mediation board.
   In addition, Schneider said airline contract disputes fall under
the Railway Labor Act and are governed by different mediation
guidelines than those for other industries.
   Organized labor officials praised Mrs. Dole's efforts to help
break the coal stalemate, but expressed skepticism about any
long-term change in the government's ``hands off'' approach to
labor disputes.
   ``You can never take one incident'' and call it a trend, said
AFL-CIO spokeswoman Lorrie McHugh. Bush vetoed legislation to
create a special panel to investigate the strike against Eastern
Airlines, she and others noted.
   Both sides in the coal dispute said Mrs. Dole's appointment of
special mediator W.J. Usery and organizing face-to-face talks
between Pittston Co. Chairman Paul Douglas and United Mine Workers
President Richard Trumka was instrumental in achieving a tentative
settlement New Year's Day.
   The agreement, which would end a 9-month-old strike, is subject
to ratification by the company's 1,700 striking workers in
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
   Union officials also said they appreciated an October visit Mrs.
Dole made to a picket line at a remote Virginia coal field, as well
as New Year's Day phone calls she placed to three striking miners.
   ``She said she wanted to make 1990 a happier new year for me and
my family and she wanted me to tell the other miners. Goose bumps
popped up,'' said Fred Wallace, one of the UMW workers contacted by
Mrs. Dole. Wallace, a miner for 20 years, was one of the strikers
who met with Mrs. Dole in October when she visited a picket line in
rural Russell County, Va.
   Under Mrs. Dole, the Bush administration has tried to mend
relations with organized labor after eight years of hostility under
President Reagan.
   Schneider said union officials are correct to reserve judgment
about future labor disputes. ``This is not necessarily setting a
precedent in the labor secretary getting involved. Every labor
dispute is different,'' she said.
   She said Mrs. Dole initiated the federal move to enter the
bitter strike, and was not trying to score political points for the
Bush administration.
   ``Mrs. Dole contacted the White House. The Bush administration
did not say, `Elizabeth, you go down to the coal fields.' It was
part and parcel Mrs. Dole's idea,'' Schneider said.
   One union official tempered his praise for Mrs. Dole by
suggesting the Bush administration saw the coal strike as a chance
to make points on several fronts.
   The UMW official, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted the
strike captured wide attention when an official of Poland's
Solidarity union and other foreign labor leaders visited the coal
fields in October and criticized the treatment of striking miners.
   In addition, the official said, Pittston is a chief supplier of
coal to Japan and the administration wants to ensure that Japan's
supplies remain steady. The settlement also provides an opportunity
for the administration to advance ideas in health care, a key issue
in the coal dispute.
   The administration's intervention ``didn't fall out of the sky.
Government officials make policy and move on issues to respond to
public pressure, not necessarily out of the goodness of their
hearts,'' the official said.
   Even so, UMW spokesman John Duray said Mrs. Dole's intervention
was a welcome and ``significant departure from what the Labor
Department's done for the last 10 years.''
   Under Mrs. Dole, the agency ``saw itself as an agency that could
help resolve a dispute rather than an agency that should take a
hands-off attitude,'' Duray said.

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Julio Gallo, co-owner of the world's
largest winery, was injured Tuesday in a two-car collision that
left one person dead.
   Gallo, 79, suffered serious head injuries and was taken to San
Jose Medical Center where he was listed in guarded condition. His
wife, Eileen, 74, also was listed in guarded condition with chest
injuries. They were in the hospital's intensive care unit.
   California Highway Patrol Officer Tom Melden said Gallo's 1989
Lincoln Town Car veered across a double yellow line along Pacheco
Pass and struck a 1988 Honda.
   The accident occurred on Highway 152 at the Cedar Creek Bridge
junction in eastern Santa Clara County, about five miles west of
the Merced County line.
   Coroner's investigator Tom Tallan said a 26-year-old San Jose
woman who was driving the Honda died of massive head and other
traumatic injuries.
   The two passengers in the car _ her 27-year-old husband and
their 6-month-old son _ were airlifted to Valley Medical Center.
The man was listed in stable condition with numerous cuts and a
concussion. The infant was also listed in stable condition with
minor injuries.
   Tallan declined to release the woman's name until her husband
and family members could be notified.
   He said the woman's car was struck at the driver's door by
Gallo's car before both cars spun around and skidded off the road.
   Gallo and his brother, Ernest, control the Gallo empire, a
private company that annually records more than $1 billion in
sales. The company controls 28 percent of the U.S. wine market.

<HEAD>Airline Passengers Group Praises Northwest For Bomb Warning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An airline passenger group says Northwest
Airlines' decision to tell passengers about a bomb threat last week
was ``a refreshing change of attitude.''
   More than 100 travelers gave up bookings on Saturday's Flight 51
from Paris to Detroit after learning of the bomb threat. The DC-10,
with a capacity of 284 passengers, arrived safely in Detroit with
22 passengers on board.
   The Virginia-based Airline Passengers Association wrote
Northwest President Alfred Checchi on Tuesday to ``express
appreciation and support'' for the airlines' decision to publicly
discuss the threat and give passengers the option of taking other
flights, said association head Richard Livingston.
   ``We just felt that the action by Northwest was a refreshing
change of attitude on the part of the industry,'' Livingston said.

<HEAD>Levin Calls for U.S. Troop Reduction in Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., says U.S. troop
strength in western europe can be cut by a third.
   Levin said Tuesday that the first phase of negotiations with the
Soviet Union aimed at cutting the 300,000 U.S. troops in Western
Europe to 275,000 should be followed immediately with a second
round of negotiations to reduce force levels to about 200,000.
   The chairman of the Senate Armed forces subcommittee on
conventional forces and alliance defense, commented after returning
from a visit to Czechoslovakia, and East and West Berlin.
   He said he was told by East German Defense Minister Theodore
Hoffman that his country's 1990 defense budget will be cut by about
20 percent, significantly deeper than the 10 percent reduction
already announced.
   A significant reduction in U.S. force levels in Western Europe
can now be made safely because the forces of the Warsaw Pact can no
longer be relied on to join the Soviet Union in a cohesive attack
on the West, Levin said.
   Levin said reductions in U.S. forces in Europe should be coupled
with large cuts in the U.S. defense budget with the savings applied
to waging the war on drugs, reducing the budget deficit, improving
education, cleaning up the environment and aiding the newly
emerging non-communist governments in Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Fund to Aid Poland Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department says a $1 billion
multilateral fund has been created to help Poland in its economic
reform program.
   ``The stabilization fund will provide Poland with a supplemental
line of reserves to support its new foreign exchange regime which
is an essential element of Poland's market-oriented economic reform
program designed to restore price stability and growth in the
Polish economy,'' the Treasury announcement said Tuesday.
   The United States contributed about $200 million to the fund.
Other major contributors are expected to include Britain, Canada,
West Germany, Japan, Italy, France, Switzerland, Austria and Spain.
   The Treasury announced last week that additional support to
Poland is being provided through a short-term multilateral bridge
loan of up to $500 million. The U.S. commitment to this loan also
is $200 million.

<TEXT>
   Rescuers searched the Gulf of California
today for 11 American tourists and three Mexican crew members
missing after their boat sank during a diving expedition, port
officials said.
   An American _ one of two survivors found after spending more
than a day in the water _ said Tuesday that a large wave had
capsized the boat early Monday.
   ``I was saved thanks to a door I floated on,'' the Hermosillo,
Mexico, newspaper El Imparcial quoted Opram Watson as saying.
   Authorities did not learn of the accident until 1 p.m. Tuesday
after a ferry on its regular run from Guaymas to Santa Rosalia, on
the Baja peninsula, rescued the other survivor, a Mexican crew
member identified as Vicente Gonzalez Mancilla, said port Capt.
Joaquin Dorantes.
   Officials said both survivors were believed to be in good
condition.
   Dorantes said other passengers who had been with Watson
disappeared.
   ``He said there were four other people holding on to the same
door with him but in the night (Monday) he lost them,'' Dorantes
said.
   He said the Mexican-registered Santa Barbara sank about 3:30
a.m. Monday, 2{ hours after leaving Isla Tortugas on the western
side of the gulf.
   ``After it overturned, the yacht took less than five minutes to
sink,'' El Imparcial quoted Watson as saying.
   A reporter for the newspaper spoke with Watson in San Carlos,
near Guaymas, where he arrived Tuesday night after being picked up
by a pleasure boat.
   Dorantes said Watson was wearing a life jacket. He said his
information came from radio contact with the boat that picked
Watson out of the sea.
   All 12 tourists on board were Americans, said Andres Mladineo,
another port official. KOLD-TV in Tucson, Ariz., said nine of the
passengers were from Tucson and three from California.
   Dorantes said planes were expected to join 10 boats in the
search this morning. The U.S. Coast Guard in San Diego had been
asked to dispatch two planes, El Imparcial said.
   The boats remained throughout the night in the area where the
survivors were found, Dorantes said.
   Dorantes and Capt. Roman Henchi of the 6th naval zone said the
cause of the accident was not known. But Mladineo, an engineer with
the port authority, said wind was believed to be responsible.
   ``There was a little wind and the boat turned over,'' Mladineo
said.
   Isla Tortugas is about 60 miles southwest of Guaymas. Guaymas is
270 miles south of Tucson, Ariz., and 875 miles northwest of Mexico
City.

   U.S. troops who invaded Panama have
begun their return home with a sweet, two-word message: mission
accomplished.
   ``Now they have a democratic government _ it's what they want.
They love Americans,'' said Army Sgt. John Grauer, 29, of Fresno,
Calif. ``They love what we did.''
   Military officials said 126 soldiers arrived at Fort Ord on
Tuesday, while 15 airmen returned to Pope Air Force Base in North
Carolina.
   The 141 soldiers were the first uninjured troops to pull out of
Panama since the U.S. invasion Dec. 20.
   Spec. 4 Ralph Santos, a 19-year-old soldier from Los Angeles,
said the reaction of Panamanians boosted the troops' spirits.
   ``Overall, the morale of the soldiers was greatly increased. The
infantry guys were treated like heroes by the Panamanians,'' said
Santos, who speaks Spanish and was called on at times to interpret
for military police. ``In some ways I was expecting more of a
negative reaction.''
   In North Carolina, Capt. Bob Anderson, a pilot, was greeted with
hugs and kisses from his wife and their three children.
   Asked how he felt, the 30-year-old Anderson said, ``It's
obvious, isn't it?''
   Most of the returning soldiers in California were from field
artillery and air defense batteries that provided protection for
infantrymen in Panama City, a Panamanian army base at Rio Hato on
the Pacific coast, and in the city of David on the Costa Rican
border.
   ``Their military mission is finished,'' said Maj. David Super, a
Pentagon spokesman.
   The artillery troops were called in to assist infantrymen, but
did not have to fire any weapons other than flares to light up the
sky for infantryman, said 2nd Lt. John Jaskwhich.
   Some troops, however, flew into the Rio Hato area while fighting
was still intense and the sound of gunfire made them nervous, the
soldiers said.
   ``The flight crew told us it was pretty hot. The plane was
getting shot at when we were coming in,'' said Jaskwhich. ``I'm
just glad to be back to celebrate a little Christmas.''
   President Bush on Monday expressed hope that the remaining U.S.
soldiers in Panama could leave ``as soon as possible.''
   ``The president is glad to see some of the troops coming home
and hopes the rest can leave as soon as possible,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. But he offered no timetable.
   About 12,000 troops are permanently assigned to Panama. Another
14,000 were sent in for the effort to topple strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Twenty-three U.S. service personnel have been killed in the
operation and 322 wounded. Among Panamanians, 297 soldiers and
about 300 civilians have been killed, according to the U.S.
military.

   South Korean riot police used $51
million worth of tear gas in the past 10 years to put down various
protests, according to police figures published today.
   The number of tear gas shells fired by police reached 1.87
million over the period, an average of 511 a day. The country's
police use canisters, grenades and shells to spread tear gas.
   In an effort to reduce injuries, police last year introduced
Israeli-made armored vans that fire tear gas from water cannons.

   The former land reform secretary says
intrigue follows sex as the second most popular sport in the
Philippines and she wants to be remembered for shapely legs and not
alleged links to coup plotters.
   Miriam Defensor Santiago was replaced Sunday as secretary of the
Department of Agrarian Reform during a major Cabinet shakeup.
   Her name reportedly appeared on a list of possible members of a
junta that would have been installed had military mutineers toppled
President Corazon Aquino last month.
   ``I appeal to you not to include my name in your junta list
again because it gets me into trouble,'' Mrs. Santiago told
reporters Tuesday. ``Instead, you may include me in the list of
Filipinas with the most shapely legs.''
   Mrs. Santiago also complained that her tenure in the agrarian
reform department was undermined by political intrigue in the
Aquino administration.
   ``In this country, intrigue is the second most popular indoor
sport, second only to sex,'' she said.
   Mrs. Santiago's departure from government removes one of the
most colorful figures in the Aquino administration.
   As immigration commissioner, Mrs. Santiago once publicly called
a congressional critic a ``fungus-face'' and suggested he stick his
finger in an electrical socket. She then challenged the congressman
to a fistfight, an offer he never accepted.
   Later, she threatened to ``chop into a thousand pieces'' corrupt
employees and throw them to the sharks in Manila Bay. ``However, I
doubt if the sharks would eat you out of a sense of professional
courtesy,'' she added.
   Mrs. Santiago, a former judge, was named agrarian reform
secretary last July after the immigration post.

   Amnesty International said today that the Israeli
government appears to have encouraged the killings of unarmed
Palestinians in its effort to crush the uprising in the occupied
lands.
   The worldwide human rights organization said the guidelines for
the use of firearms by Israeli troops permit unjustifiable killings
of Palestinians, and claimed abuses are not adequately investigated.
   ``We are concerned that taken together these factors appear to
add up to more than just tolerance of serious abuses and amount to
real encouragement of them,'' Amnesty said in its January
newsletter.
   In Jerusalem, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yossi Amihud said
Tuesday ahead of the newsletter's official release that the report
was ``an outrageous accusation. It is total nonsense and absolutely
baseless.''
   Amnesty said unarmed Palestinians have been fatally shot by
Israeli forces almost daily since the Palestinian uprising began in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in December 1987.
   It said the army, the paramilitary border police and other law
enforcement agencies in the occupied territories have tried to stop
the disturbances by shooting at demonstrators, using tear gas and
severely beating detainees.
   Their use of force has often been ``excessive and
indiscriminate,'' Amnesty said. It said it has raised all the cases
in its report with Israeli authorities but is not aware of any
detailed findings of any investigation being made public.
   Israeli authorities say they investigate every fatal shooting.
Amnesty said that in some cases evidence was sought from
Palestinian witnesses and the scene of the killing was inspected,
but that investigations appear to rely mainly on evidence from
soldiers or police involved.
   It said official investigations generally take a long time,
their findings are not automatically made public and those found
guilty of abuses are not always adequately punished.
   Amnesty said that since the beginning of the uprising only four
soldiers are reported to have been convicted of manslaughter.
   It called for a review of the firearms guidelines, and said
Israel's highest authorities must make clear to all law enforcement
officials that abuses will not be tolerated and all those
responsible will be prosecuted.
   The Israeli Embassy in London said in response that 61 soldiers
have been convicted and 46 sentenced to various terms of
imprisonment.
   More than 640 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the uprising, and another 166 have been killed by
fellow Arabs who suspected them of collaborating with Israel.
Forty-three Israelis have died.
   More than 560 of the Palestinians were fatally shot by Israelis,
with 130 victims under age 16, 35 under 12 and some as young as 3,
Amnesty said.
   Most were killed by ordinary bullets, although by the end of
September 117 had been killed by plastic bullets, and others by
rubber bullets or rubber-coated metal pellets, it said.
   At least 15 reportedly died after beatings by Israeli forces and
70 or more died in tear gas-related incidents, about half after
canisters were thrown into confined spaces, it said.
   Amnesty said the scope of the firearms guidelines had been
progressively extended during the uprising, and live ammunition may
now be used against suspects, including anyone wearing a mask.
   Israeli regulations require soldiers to shout an order to halt,
then fire into the air and finally aim at the suspect's legs,
Amnesty said. It said it was not clear how serious an offense must
be to permit the use of firearms, and alleged the guidelines are
often disregarded by Israeli forces.
   Although most killings appear to have occurred during
demonstrations or riots, in an ``alarmingly high number of
instances,'' those shot do not appear to have been involved in any
life-threatening or even violent activities, Amnesty said.
   It also charged that after some shootings, Israeli forces
withheld or hampered emergency medical care.

<HEAD>Alan Hale, Skipper on `Gilligan's Island,' Dead of Cancer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Actor Alan Hale Jr., who appeared in 65 films
but was best known for playing the jovial skipper who led a zany
band of castaways on television's ``Gilligan's Island,'' has died
of cancer.
   He died Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital, where he had been
hospitalized for cancer, said Bonnie Churchill, a spokeswoman for
Hale's family. She said he had been hospitalized about a month
after being diagnosed with the disease a year ago.
   The family said Hale was 68, but reference books listed his age
as 71.
   Bob Denver, who played Gilligan on the series, said Hale reveled
in his worldwide fame as ``the Skipper'' and never tired of playing
the role in public.
   ``He enjoyed every single minute of it,'' said Denver, who made
personal appearances with Hale as recently as six months ago. ``He
wore his skipper's hat all the time.''
   The actor was to be cremated and his ashes scattered at sea by
the Neptune Society on Saturday.
   A native of Los Angeles, Hale appeared in 65 movies, but became
a fixture on afternoon television thanks to the widely successful
syndication of ``Gilligan's Island.'' The show ran in prime time
from 1964 to 1967 before going into syndication.
   Hale played a charter boat skipper whose craft, the Minnow, was
lost at sea and wrecked on an uncharted South Pacific island. The
show followed the misadventures of the passengers.
   ``He was a great guy and a great physical comic,'' Denver said.
``He was so strong that I could run across the stage and he could
catch me like a feather. That's what made our comedy so great.''
   The success of ``Gilligan's Island'' reruns led to Hale's
appearance in a 1978 reunion of the cast members. The two-part
special had the islanders finally rescued, only to be shipwrecked
again while on a reunion cruise. Two more sequel specials aired in
1979 and 1981.
   Hale came from a show business family. His father was a matinee
idol in silent films and his mother was an actress.
   The younger Hale bore a strong resemblance to his father, who
was often sidekick to Errol Flynn in such classics as ``The Sea
Hawk'' and ``Robin Hood'' after the advent of talking films.
   Hale was survived by his wife of 25 years, Naomi; their four
children and his sister, Karen Hale Wookey.

<HEAD>Striking Miners Await Contract Details</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   United Mine Workers, waiting for details of
a tentative agreement to end a nine-month strike, were saying
little about the walkout's impact on their lives, but a crisis
center head said it has torn them up.
   ``Some of them have been putting up a brave front while their
hearts were breaking and their pocketbooks were empty,'' Gaye
Martin said Tuesday. ``It's been devastating for some of them.''
   Martin, who runs the only crisis center in Virginia coal
country, said many of the strikers don't want Pittston Coal Group
to know the hardships caused by the strike.
   ``If I wasn't bound by confidentiality, I could tell you stories
that would break your heart and bring tears to your eyes,'' she
said in a telephone interview from the crisis center in Dickenson
County.
   Striking miners stayed on picket lines Tuesday. The contents of
the settlement were not being disclosed as UMW officials scrambled
to get printed copies of the pact.
   ``There's a lot of concerns and questions being asked about the
contents of the contract,'' said Charles Dixon, a UMW international
executive board member from District 30, based in Pikeville, Ky.
``There are secrets and then there are secrets. Things are real
hush-hush on the contents of the Pittston agreement.''
   The UMW and Pittston must sell their proposed settlement to two
judges, a federal agency and trustees of a health and retirement
fund before striking miners vote, union officials say. A vote isn't
expected at least until next week.
   ``It's going to be an interesting process,'' UMW spokesman John
Duray said Tuesday night.
   The tentative agreement was announced Monday at a news
conference held by Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole in Washington,
D.C.
   Duray said because the settlement came over a holiday, it has
slowed procedures, such as getting the contract printed.
   The sometimes-violent strike began April 5 and affected 1,700
Pittston miners in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky. At one
point, more than 46,000 miners in nearly a dozen states staged a
wildcat sympathy strike.
   A key issue was Pittston's attempt to end its contributions to
the UMW's industrywide retirement fund. Pittston said it couldn't
afford to continue payments to the fund, which covers 130,000
pensioners who retired between 1947 and 1976.
   The Roanoke Times &amp; World-News reported today that Pittston
compromised on its health care stance; the company had wanted
insurance covering 80 percent of costs with workers paying the rest.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified national expert on the coal
industry that the new agreement calls for the company's insurance
plan to pay the cost of health care for working miners and those
who retired after 1975. But deductibles will be increased, the
newspaper said.
   UMW officials will meet with the funds' trustees before the
agreement is voted on by striking miners, Duray said. The union and
Pittston also want to resolve more than $64 million in fines levied
by state and federal courts in Virginia courts against the union
during the strike. No hearings had been scheduled Tuesday.
   Daniel Roling, a senior mining analyst with Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets in New York, called the agreement a ``win-win
situation in that the union didn't give up any major points and
they were able to maintain medical benefits for retired workers.''
   Miners were tight-lipped and proud.
   Ocie Murray, a striking miner and pastor of the Russell Fork
Baptist Baptist Church in Council, said the majority of miners
``just had to tighten their belts.''
   Nancy Bryant, a striking miner, said: ``We've been getting by.
It's all right.''
   Martin, the crisis center head, had a different view. She said
she knows of six miners who lost homes and several who lost cars
because they couldn't meet monthly payments. She said marriages
also were lost.
   ``Some of them have been under so much pressure their homes have
broken up,'' she said.

<HEAD>Jackson Takes Take Office in Atlanta; Woman Mayor Inaugurated in
Pittsburgh</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Maynard H. Jackson, who served from 1974 to 1982 as Atlanta's
first black mayor, returned to the chief executive's office with a
promise to fight homelessness, crime and drugs.
   ``I'm back, and I want you to know I'm fired up, turned on and
I'm ready to roll, starting tomorrow morning,'' Jackson said
Tuesday. ``As the Lord is my witness and my guide, we're going to
move Atlanta on up to higher ground, and we're going to do it
together.''
   Jackson's third term began during ceremonies at the Atlanta
Civic Center. Among those who attended: the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown, NAACP Executive
Director Benjamin Hooks, and Coretta Scott King, widow of slain
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   Elsewhere, Pittsburgh's first elected woman mayor, Sophie
Masloff, promised to help families with jobs and housing at her
inauguration, while in Houston Kathy Whitmire took the oath of
office for a record-tying fifth term as mayor.
   Mrs. Masloff, flanked by her family and colleagues, told a crowd
of several hundred packing the lobby of the City-County Building on
Tuesday that her administration would cooperate with other
governments and the private sector in competing for new business
and conventions.
   ``In everything we do, we will be concerning ourselves with
families: saving and creating jobs, owning a home and getting a
mortgage, protecting people from crime and drugs, caring for our
older citizens, guiding and loving our children,'' she said.
   Mrs. Masloff said she would meet with Gov. Robert P. Casey to
work on a plan to provide property tax relief for the elderly and
trim the city's 10 percent amusement tax, which covers sports
events, concerts and other entertainment.
   She also promised to form a riverfront development commission to
create housing, jobs and green space along the Allegheny,
Monongahela and Ohio rivers.
   The former head of the City Council, Mrs. Masloff automatically
became mayor following the death of Richard Caliguiri on May 6,
1988. She ran unopposed in the November general election after
defeating four challengers in the Democratic primary in May.
   In Houston, Mrs. Whitmire was joined by 13 other City Council
members in induction ceremonies at the Brown Theater. She gave no
hint whether she would accept a 24 percent raise that would boost
her salary to $130,875.
   Mrs. Whitmire usually accepts a lower amount for her job,
spokesman Paul Mabry said. Since she first took office in 1982, she
has turned down a total of about $125,000 in pay, he said.
   Her raise, along with a nearly 14 percent hike for city council
members, goes up automatically under a 1977 state law that sets
salaries of elected city officials at a percentage of the pay of a
Harris County district judge, which is $87,250 this year.
   Atlanta's Jackson stressed the need for unity Tuesday.
   ``Many people are waiting to see if we will grasp the
opportunities we have to give people in need a hand up, or whether
Atlanta simply will wave as the tides of change and excitement pass
by,'' Jackson said. ``I invite you to join me in extending the hand
of humanity to the thousands drowning in the undertow of poverty,
neglect and homelessness.''
   His most immediate problem may be money. Finance officers, under
the outgoing administration of Andrew Young, have called for a
property tax increase; Jackson says he doesn't want one.
   Jackson, 51, served the maximum two consecutive terms allowed
under the city charter and was succeeded by Young in 1982. Young,
having served two terms, is running for governor this year.
   During his eight years out of office, Jackson practiced law, but
remained a popular political figure. His chief challenger in the
October mayor's race, Fulton County Commission Chairman Michael L.
Lomax, dropped out of the race last summer after polls showed him
far behind.

<TEXT>
   Airline flights were canceled and
residents marveled at a spectacular light show, as Redoubt Volcano
shot ash as high as 40,000 feet in its biggest eruption since
waking from a 25-year sleep.
   The Alaska Volcano Observatory said the eruption at 5:50 p.m.
Tuesday was Redoubt's biggest since seismic activity began Dec. 13.
   Pilots reported a plume as high as 40,000 feet and said lava
appeared to be flowing down the volcano's northwest flank 115 miles
southwest of Anchorage, observatory scientists said.
   A radio station near Kenai, across Cook Inlet from the volcano,
was swamped with calls from people who saw lights in the sky.
   ``We've had listeners on the air reporting what looked like
heated, falling stones,'' said John Davis of station KSRM. He said
people parked their cars near inlet beaches to watch the display.
   Geologist Robert McGimsey of the observatory in Anchorage said
it was possible the reported lava flow was a mixture of ash and hot
gas. He said scientists would have to wait until daylight to
investigate.
   The volcano spewed an ``extensive ash plume,'' McGimsey said.
Another geologist at the observatory, Don Richter, said late
Tuesday night that it appeared most of the ash had settled before
reaching populated areas.
   Richter said ``a number of strong but less severe (seismic)
events'' occurred at about 8 p.m.
   ``It looks like it may keep up this level of explosive
activity'' today, he said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration advised pilots to
``continually evaluate operations to and from Anchorage.'' A number
of flights scheduled for Tuesday night and this morning were
canceled, and some night flights were diverted to other airports.
   Scientists have been monitoring the volcano around the clock.
The peak erupted three weeks ago and spewed ash 33,000 feet into
the air the next day. Varying levels of seismic activity continued
through the month.
   Last month, Christmas travelers and mail were delayed and
Anchorage air traffic slowed to a trickle after a KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines Boeing 747 flew through ash, lost power to all four
engines and fell more than two miles. The plane made a safe
emergency landing after the engines were restarted.
   The habitation nearest the volcano, the Drift River oil storage
facility 20 miles away, was evacuated Tuesday when scientists
issued warnings about the upcoming eruption, the Alaska Division of
Emergency Services said. About 11 people usually are assigned to
the facility.
   Richter said the lights observed by people on the Kenai
Peninsula are common after eruptions.
   ``There's been a lot of electrical discharging in that eruption
column _ a large electrical buildup,'' he said.
   Mark Norgren, who lives on a bluff about seven miles north of
Kenai, said he saw ``three or four occasions of bolt lightning''
during a 45-minute period soon after the eruption.
   ``It's like a flash that radiates throught the cloud,'' he said.
``When it comes through the cloud, it just illuminates the whole
sky.''

<HEAD>Bank Holiday Extended to Wednesday in Argentina</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As it attempted to hold down a
devastating inflationary spiral, the 6-month-old government of
President Carlos Menem ordered banks and foreign exchange houses to
remain closed today.
   The ``bank holiday'' that began Tuesday was Argentina's sixth in
less than one month, ordered by the government as it tries to
stabilize the country's currency, the austral.
   The last days of 1989 saw panic-buying and hoarding by shoppers,
the withholding of supplies by distributers and restricted sales by
businesses, particularly pharmacies, gas stations and neighborhood
food stores.
   Argentines lacking confidence in their economy bought so many
dollars last month that the austral lost nearly 50 percent of its
value.
   In a bid to curtail dollar-buying and bring down interest rates
that have topped 600 percent a month, the government on Monday
moved to restrict the amount of australs in circulation.
   Raul Cuello, secretary of public revenue, said he was
``absolutely certain'' that when banks and exchange houses reopen
the dollar will trade below last week's levels.
   However, he told the government news agency Telam, ``We are
immersed in a tremendous crisis that requires much effort,
imagination and constant adjusting.''
   The devaluation of the austral has fueled interest rates as
banks struggle to retain funds that investors wanted to convert to
the safer U.S. dollar. It also has ignited price hikes of 100
percent in most goods and commodities.
   Devaluations that totaled 99 percent in 1989 ``pulverized''
savings in australs, Economy Minister Antonio Gonzalez said Monday,
while sharply reducing the value of government revenues and
touching off demands for higher wages.
   The economy was chaotic even before Menem took office and
Argentines fear shortages of food and medicine, high prices and
shrunken real wages _ all of which could touch off the kind of
social unrest that occurred in May.
   Foot riots broke out across the country in May and June, with
looting widespread by people made desperate by the shrinking value
of their wages.
   Comparing the current economic dilemma with that of the months
before a 1976 military coup, Antonio Cafiero, president of the
ruling Peronist Party, said, ``This is much worse than that.'' The
military remained in power until the 1983 election of Raul
Alfonsin, Menem's predecessor.
   While there are few signs of military unrest, Cafiero, governor
of Buenos Aires Province, said, ``All of us (governors) are worried
about possible reoccurrences'' of food riots.
   The government has embarked on four stabilization plans in six
months, and says it plans to press with plans to sell money-losing
state companies, narrow the budget deficit, reform the tax code and
deregulate the economy.
   However, analysts said the economic convulsions indicate a lack
of public confidence in Menem's ability to carry out such a program
in the face of opposition by unions fighting to protect jobs and
benefits, and by businesses that sell to the state.
   Menem has had three economy ministers and three Central Bank
presidents since he took office.
   On Tuesday, longtime adviser Eduardo Curia resigned as secretary
of economic matters. Curia endorsed the so-called ``dollarization''
of the economy that Menem at one point reportedly approved, but
finally rejected last weekend.
   That decision would have allowed the U.S. dollar to be legally
used to set wages, prices, bond values, apartment rents and other
variables in an economy beset in 1989 by inflation topping 5,000
percent.

<HEAD>Publisher Accepts 20 Resignations at the Jerusalem Post</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publisher of the Jerusalem Post has
accepted the resignations of 20 journalists who said they were
leaving because the newspaper's editorial independence had been
compromised.
   Publisher Yehuda Levy on Tuesday sent letters to the journalists
ordering them to clear their desks, and three more members of the
editorial staff resigned later in the day.
   Those whose resignations were accepted included managing editor
David Landau and eight other senior editors and reporters.
   The journalists accuse Levy, a former Israeli army colonel with
no previous experience in journalism, of damaging the integrity of
Israel's only English-language daily.
   The newspaper's top editor, Erwin Frankel, resigned last week,
saying Levy had undermined his editorial authority.
   In their letters of resignation to Levy and Canadian owner David
Radler on Monday, the other journalists said they had no choice but
to leave because of ``an ever-increasing erosion of editorial
independence.''
   According to Landau, the resignations were triggered by Levy's
removal of an editorial from the Post's weekly international
edition.
   The Nov. 30 editorial defended the Post's right to criticize the
government after Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing
Likud Party accused it of harming Israel's reputation abroad.
   ``That editorial was in fact the touchstone of whether we have a
really editorially independent newspaper ... The issue was the most
basic issue of journalistic integrity,'' said Landau, 42, who began
working at the Post in 1970.
   Levy denied accusations that he is moving the historically
liberal newspaper in a conservative direction.
   ``I want to say that all the labels they are trying to apply to
me are labels that stick well in the media. But there's nothing to
them,'' Levy said in an interview on Israel radio.
   ``The dispute is not over what they are claiming it's about, but
over proper management of this workplace,'' he said.
   Levy said about 80 ``permanent journalists'' still work for the
newspaper.
   Joanna Yehiel, who quit her job as magazine and features editor,
estimated that only about 30 full-time journalists remain.
   Levy was appointed president and publisher in July by Radler,
chairman of the board of Hollinger Inc., a Canadian newspaper
group. Hollinger Inc. bought a controlling interest in the Post in
April.
   The paper's editorial staff filed notice of a labor dispute
Thursday and demanded Levy's removal. The notice will allow them to
take action, including a strike or work slowdown, after a two-week
waiting period.
   The wave of resignations began Nov. 30 with the departure of the
head editor, Ari Rath, who had persistent disagreements with Levy.

   ``Roger &amp; Me,'' the darkly comic documentary
that depicts a woman clubbing, gutting and skinning a rabbit for
food, has gotten bad reviews from the American Humane Association.
   ``It shows a little rabbit being murdered,'' said Betty Denny
Smith, director of the Los Angeles office of the association's
animal proection division. ``I do not see any humor in that.''
   Filmmaker Michael Moore, whose documentary on how the loss of
30,000 jobs at several General Motors Corp. plants in Flint, Mich.,
devastated the town of 150,000, defended the scene.
   ``It's a pivotal moment in the film because people don't want to
look,'' he said. ``They don't want to look to see the brutality of
what has happened, not to this rabbit, but to this town _ that a
woman is reduced to killing rabbits for food in the middle of the
hometown of the world's richest corporation.''
   Moore, in a recent phone interview from New York, also expressed
bewilderment that the rabbit-killing scene had provoked outrage
among animal activists while scenes that he said depict brutality
and cruelty to people have been ignored.
   The film was one of the surprise hits of 1989, making the 10
best lists of more than a dozen film critics across the country. It
traces the impact on Flint of GM Chairman Roger Smith's decision to
close the local auto plants.
   The woman who clubs the rabbit is the wife of a laid-off GM
employee. She said in the movie she raises the animals ``for pets
or meat.''

   Wall Street welcomed the new decade in high
style: The Dow Jones industrial average soared to a record.
   In the first session of the 1990s, the closely watched index
jumped 56.95 points to close Tuesday at 2,810.15, surpassing its
previous closing high of 2,791.41, reached Oct. 9.
   The index surged more than 29 points during the last half-hour
of trading alone, boosted by computerized buying programs.
   Broader market indicators also chalked up big gains and
advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-1 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Stocks declined early in the session as traders awaited the
National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly report on
the manufacturing economy.
   But prices moved broadly higher after the association reported
the industrial sector remained weak in December. Traders believe
the Federal Reserve is more likely to push interest rates lower if
the economy is slowing.
   Prices also were boosted as institutional investors, flush with
cash after liquidating some of their holdings at the end of 1989,
began to pick up stocks _ the so-called ``January effect'' that
frequently accompanies the first month of the new year in the stock
market.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Urges `Bounty' in Recent Bombings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson called on the Bush
administration to offer a bounty to capture whoever is responsible
for a series of bombings in the Southeast that killed a federal
judge and a civil rights lawyer.
   ``Just as President Bush is willing to issue a bounty for
(Manuel) Noriega, it must be done for this,'' Jackson said Tuesday
night at the Civic Center, where he attended the inauguration of
Mayor Maynard H. Jackson.
   After the U.S. invasion of Panama, the Bush administration had
set a $1 million reward for information leading to the arrest of
the deposed dictator, who later sought asylum at the Vatican
Embassy.
   Bush on Tuesday sent a letter deploring the recent series of
racially motivated attacks to NAACP leader Benjamin Hooks.
   ``The recent bombings make it clear we have not totally beaten
back the evils of bigotry and racial prejudice. We cannot let up in
the fight against racism,'' Bush wrote in the two-paragraph letter
to the executive director of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   Killed in last month's bombings were 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals Judge Robert Vance and Robert Robinson of Savannah, a black
lawyer who worked with the NAACP.
   Last week, a group calling itself Americans for a Competent
Federal Judicial System claimed responsibility for the bombs, and
threatened to assassinate two more NAACP officials.
   Jesse Jackson said ``no one is safe'' until whoever is
responsible is arrested.
   In Baltimore, police placed the NAACP's national headquarters
under 24-hour surveillance following picketing New Year's Day by a
handful of demonstrators who shouted slogans advocating racial
purity and carried placards that read ``Nuke the NAACP.''
   Police officials consider the national headquarters building,
located atop a secluded hillside, to be a logical target for
extremist groups, according to Dennis S. Hill, a police spokesman.
   ``We're very concerned that we do not have an incident over
there, and we're doing everything we can to prevent one,'' Hill
said Tuesday.
   Atlanta police planned to provide extra security throughout
January, as a series of events are held in honor of slain civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``It requires us to stiffen our manpower,'' Maj. W.W. Holley,
head of the Atlanta police special operations unit, said Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, in Savannah, where Robinson died after he opened a
package containing a bomb at his law office, security has dropped
off.
   The security checkpoint set up at the Chatham County Courthouse
after Robinson's death is coming down. Sheriff Walter Mitchell Jr.
said he does not have the personnel to maintain it.
   County Commission Chairman Robert McCorkle said the county
cannot afford to spend ``$1,000 on security right now. We've got a
lot of financial woes.''
   The checkpoint went up Dec. 20, two days after Robinson's death.
During the first week, deputies confiscated a handgun and about 30
knives.

<HEAD>State to Allow Students to Use Calculators on Math Regents Exams</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York state high school students can
throw away their slide rules.
   Starting next year, students taking Regents' math exams will be
able to use calculators to check their addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division, said Fred Paul, head of the state
Education Department's mathematics bureau.
   ``What a nice, forward-looking move,'' said Shirley Frye,
president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.
   Students have long been permitted to use slide rules to help
them in Regents' exams, which are designed for college-bound
students.
   Most of the Regents' math test involves problem-solving in areas
like algebra, geometry and trigonometry. Students will still be
required to show the work involved in reaching a conclusion, with
the calculators just helping them check the basic computations,
Paul said.
   The calculators still will not be allowed for basic math
proficiency tests at all grade levels, he said. And students will
only be permitted to bring in the simple, four-function calculators
that add, subtract, multiply and divide, he said.
   ``Calculators are part of everyday technology,'' Frye said.
``What we really want to know is whether students can solve
problems. Computation is just a small part of mathematics.''
   The head of the math teachers group said there's a certain
segment of society that wants students today to suffer with the
same calculations they had to go through. But it's impractical, she
said.
   ``You don't see any adults in real life doing 30 long-division
problems,'' Frye said. ``If a person doing income tax wasn't using
the modern technology, you probably wouldn't go to them.''
   Since New York and California, which is developing plans to
include calculators in teaching curriculum, are both leaders in
education policy, Frye said she expected other states to follow in
allowing calculators on tests.
   Calculators will first be allowed on the June 1991 math Regents
exams, Paul said.

<TEXT>
   A winter storm gathered strength over the Southwest today,
dumping heavy snow across parts of California, Nevada, Utah and
Arizona. In the Midwest, low pressure was expected to bring light
snow and increasing cloudiness today.
   As much as 30 inches of snow was expected by today in Utah
elevations above 9,000 feet. Snow in northern Utah Tuesday ranged
from six inches in the valleys to up to 22 inches in the
Alta-Snowbird mountain area.
   Three people died in weather-related accidents Tuesday. A state
social worker and her teen-age client were killed in a four-car
accident on slick roads on Interstate 15 in Utah County, and an
87-year-old Idaho woman died Tuesday afternoon in a two-car
collision on icy U.S. 91 in Box Elder County.
   Strong northerly winds prevailed in the wake of the Southwest
storm. A wind advisory was issued for the mountains of Northern
California.
   The storm dumped 3 inches of snow on Mount Charleston, Nev., and
brought Las Vegas its first measurable precipitation since Aug. 17.
   It brings welcome relief to the parched Western states, and may
help avoid drought conditions later this year.
   Syracuse has no lack of precipitation, as it was declared New
York state's snowiest city in the 1980s by the National Weather
Service on Tuesday. Last month was the city's coldest and snowiest
December on record, pushing Syracuse's snowfall for the decade to
1,075 inches, according to meteorologist Peter Jung.
   Temperatures Tuesday warmed above the freezing mark across most
of the nation. Readings warmed into the 50s and 60s in the southern
Plains and into the 70s across Florida.
   Three Florida cities shared Tuesday's high of 78 degrees: Fort
Myers, Miami and Tavernier.

<HEAD>President Dismisses Internal Affairs Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Samuel K. Doe has fired his
internal affairs minister and a senior local official for
mishandling reports of an impending rebel invasion.
   A government statement Tuesday said Col. Edward Sackor and
Stephen Daniels, superintendent of Nimba County, had misled the
administration about a plot to destabilize Doe's regime.
   The statement said Sackor and Daniels recommended in October the
dismissal and detention of a local chief, Jerry Gonyon, after he
reported unusual activities in Nimba County, where the rebels first
struck.
   Nimba County, which is now under a dusk to dawn curfew, borders
Ivory Coast, Liberia's eastern neighbor. The government says rebels
entered the country from the Ivory Coast on Dec. 24.
   It was unclear whether Sackor's dismissal was also related to
official reports that some of the alleged invaders in custody had
escaped.
   On Sunday, Doe announced that two groups of insurgents had
entered the country. The West African nation's leader said one
group killed a police sergeant at the border town of Butuo in Nimba
County before government soldiers ``arrested the situation.''
   Doe said the other group reached the capital, Monrovia, but
abandoned their arms in the central market and surrendered. He said
they confessed to planning to destabilize the government.
   Justice Minister Jenkins Scott said Tuesday that the invaders
numbered 96, had been trained in Libya and Burkina Faso and entered
Liberia from the Ivory Coast.
   Doe, a former master sergeant in the Liberian army, came to
power in a bloody coup in April 1980 in which President William
Tolbert, a descendant of freed American slaves, and most of his
political allies were killed.
   Doe himself has since withstood several alleged plots and claims
the Ivory Coast harbors opponents of his regime. The Ivory Coast
denies the accusations.

<HEAD>New Source of Fernald Contamination Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Test wells drilled at the Fernald uranium
processing plant show a new source of uranium contamination in a
nearby aquifer.
   Two wells drilled at the federally owned plant's southwest
corner show 200 to 800 parts per billion of uranium about 70 feet
underground in the Great Miami Aquifer, The Cincinnati Enquirer
reported today. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's proposed
uranium standard for drinking water is 30 parts per billion.
   ``Nobody claimed we had all the answers yet,'' said Graham
Mitchell, Fernald team leader for the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency. ``The plant's doing this investigation just so we can find
these things. But the numbers are raising concern, and it does
point toward additional sources'' of contamination.
   A federal court, meanwhile, dismissed the U.S. Department of
Energy's appeal of the $78 million settlement reached in a lawsuit
filed by neighbors of the Fernald plant.
   Clerk Leonard Green of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on
Tuesday granted the department's request to drop the appeal.
Green's order lets the Energy Department allocate settlement money,
which would pay for medical monitoring of people living near the
plant.
   Mitchell said plant officials have known about a plume of
underground radiation creeping toward the Ohio River, about 18
miles southeast of the plant. But he said the new discovery is much
greater than the 200 to 400 parts per billion of uranium previously
found in the aquifer.
   The Great Miami Aquifer is not used for drinking water, but
authorities say it is a potential drinking water source if the Ohio
River became too polluted to use.
   Mitchell said the new discovery is north of the previously known
contamination, meaning it probably comes from a new leak because
water in the aquifer flows south toward the Ohio River.
   Westinghouse Materials Co., the plant operator, hired a company
to test the groundwater.
   ``We're concerned anytime we have uranium levels above
background,'' Westinghouse spokesman Bob Walker said. ``But this is
an area where we were looking specifically for possible
contamination. That's why we're going through all this.''
   The plant, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, processed uranium
from 1951 until last summer for use in nuclear weapons and
reactors. Processing was suspended to concentrate on cleanup. The
Energy Department, which owns the plant, acknowledged in 1985 that
the plant had leaked radioactive dust.
   Marc Johnston, assistant general counsel for the Energy
Department in Washington, said Tuesday that the department's
lawyers will meet soon with the Fernald-area residents' attorney,
Stanley Chesley of Cincinnati, to discuss how the settlement will
be paid for.
   ``We're very pleased,'' Chesley said. ``We're cautiously
optimistic because we want to get it funded as soon as possible.''

   East German President Manfred
Gerlach says the Berlin Wall is ``superfluous'' and will eventually
be dismantled, a West Germany newspaper reported today.
   East German officials previously have suggested that the barrier
be retained, at least in part, to prevent smuggling and the spread
of drugs, the AIDS virus and other social problems.
   ``We are tearing down the wall,'' the mass-circulation Bild
newspaper quoted Gerlach as saying.
   ``It is superfluous,'' Gerlach said of the wall, according to
Bild. ``It will be replaced with normal border markings.''
   Gerlach said he could not predict when the wall, erected in 1961
to stem an exodus of East German workers to the West, would be
taken down.
   Visiting Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel told reporters
Tuesday that Gerlach had said the dismantling of the wall already
has begun, referring to the more than two dozen crossings punched
through it in the past two months.
   East Germany lifted travel restrictions for its citizens on Nov.
9, unleashing a joyous rush by millions to the West for visits and
celebrations in the divided city.
   A new crossing near the historic Brandenburg Gate was opened
Dec. 23, facilitating the first joint New Year's celebration in 40
years.

<TEXT>
   Hotel queen Leona Helmsley, sentenced to four
years in prison for federal tax evasion, is ``terrified'' at the
thought of going to jail, a published report said.
   ``My stomach is in knots,'' Mrs. Helmsley said in an interview
by columnist Cindy Adams in today's New York Post. ``I'm terrified.
I'm against a whole government that built a whole case on my
personality which they said was a horror. And it's snowballing.''
   Mrs. Helmsley said she feared for herself, dismissing the
popular belief that she's tough and self-assured.
   ``I'm so insecure that when I enter a room I'll lay back until I
see a friendly face,'' she said. ``I may not want them 15 minutes
later but right then I need them.''
   According to testimony at her tax evasion trial, Mrs. Helmsley
once boasted to a maid, ``Only the little people pay taxes.''
   But Mrs. Helmsley denied ever making the comment, adding that
she knew what it was to be a little person.
   ``Look, I vacuum. And I've cleaned toilets in my life,'' she
said. ``I wasn't born with any silver spoon.''
   According to the Post, Mrs. Helmsley's eyes flooded with tears
as she spoke of fears for her husband Harry Helmsley should her
appeal fail. Helmsley was severed from the tax evasion trial after
he was found mentally incompetent.
   ``He has memory lapses. He's frail,' she said. ``Forget my life,
he wouldn't make it.''
   The hotel queen said she has barely made it through the past
months, partly because of her husband's condition.
   ``Now there's less of Harry to rely on,'' she said. ``I have
nobody left anymore.''
   Mrs. Helmsley is free on bail pending an appeal of her Aug. 30
conviction. Should her appeals fail and she goes to prison, she
would be eligible for parole after 16 months.

<HEAD>BMI, HBO Extend Licensing Agreement One Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home Box Office and music syndicate BMI extended
a licensing agreement for one month, sidestepping a court order
that could have temporarily barred HBO from broadcasting films with
BMI songs.
   Lawyers for the two companies announced the agreement Tuesday at
a hearing in a lawsuit BMI brought against HBO last week.
   In the lawsuit, BMI had asked a U.S. district judge to bar HBO
from transmitting BMI songs after Dec. 31, 1989, when the
companies' licensing agreement ended. It noted that several films
in HBO's January schedule include BMI-copyrighted songs.
   Robert Sisk, an attorney for BMI, said the companies reached the
agreement on Friday, a day after the lawsuit was filed. Sisk said
negotiations would continue on a new licensing contract that would
extend past the end of January.
   A court hearing was scheduled for Jan. 29.
   The suit was filed amid efforts by BMI to boost its cable
television levies. Beyond raising basic rates, BMI wants to collect
from local cable systems as well as from cable programmers. It now
charges just programmers.
   BMI, or Broadcast Music Inc., represents more than 100,000
composers and publishers of more than 1.5 million songs, collecting
a contracted fee whenever one of its songs is played. It licenses
radio and television stations, hotel and restaurant chains, even
discotheques.
   Its suit listed 11 films in HBO's January schedule that include
BMI songs, including the Beatles' ``Helter Skelter'' in the movie
``U2 Rattle and Hum,'' the song ``Strangers in the Night'' in
``Fright Night'' and George Thorogood's ``Bad to the Bone,'' heard
in ``Talk Radio.''
   HBO, owned by Time-Warner Inc., has more than 23 million
subscribers, making it the largest pay-television service in the
nation, according to BMI's suit.

<HEAD>Friend Kills AIDS Patient At Hospital, Turns Gun On Self</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A close friend of a dying AIDS patient shot
and killed the sick man in his hospital bed before turning the gun
on himself, authorities said.
   The apparent murder-suicide took place Tuesday afternoon in Phil
Jenkins' room at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, hospital spokesman
Ron Wise said.
   AIDS care experts said the deaths demonstrated the vital need
for psychological counseling for friends and family members of
patients as well as those afflicted with the disease.
   Detectives withheld the identity of the gunman so family could
be notified. Wise described him as a very close friend of
35-year-old Jenkins.
   ``We know they were close friends,'' police Lt. Willie Pannell
said. ``How close, I don't know.''
   Panic struck the fifth floor at Cedars-Sinai after staff,
patients and visitors heard three gunshots, witnesses said.
   An unnamed hospital visitor who was next door when the shots
were fired said a nurse was the first on the scene.
   ``She just opened up the door and found two bodies, and then
there was just chaos,'' the man said.
   A patient in a nearby room, one of the first to arrive at the
shooting scene, said he and a doctor entered the room shortly after
the gunfire rang out.
   ``I heard three shots,'' said a man who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``His wall and my wall are together. I heard he was real
sick.
   ``I went in and saw him lying there in bed on his side. The
friend was on the floor lying right by the chair.''
   The unidentified patient said a large-caliber handgun appeared
to have been used.
   Jenkins, who suffered from AIDS for about two years, entered the
hospital three weeks ago suffering multiple complications,
including pneumonia, Wise said.
   ``It's a shame that there wasn't someone who was keen and
understands how to watch out for these problems,'' said David
Kessler, president of a firm that provides home nursing and hospice
care for AIDS patients.
   Dr. Neil Schram, a member of the county Medical Association's
AIDS Committee, said ``what this shows really is the need for
psychological and psychiatric support that AIDS patients need.''
   Neither criticized existing counseling programs at Cedars-Sinai,
where in a month the facility will open a $2.5-million, 24-bed AIDS
treatment center that will ``serve the medical and psychosocial
needs of AIDS patients,'' Wise said.

<HEAD>Congressman Says He Will Not Run for Governor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy 2nd has announced he will
not run for governor in the fall, taking a political ``800-pound
gorilla'' out of the race.
   The 37-year-old Democrat, who announced his plans in a letter
dated Tuesday and sent to about 200 supporters, ended months of
speculation by saying he will instead seek re-election to Congress
in November.
   ``I do not feel that I can provide the time, effort or energy
that a gubernatorial campaign would require and continue to meet my
responsibilities as a father and as a congressman,'' Kennedy wrote.
   ``As many of you are aware, this is a particularly difficult
time for my family that requires a great deal of personal
attention.''
   Kennedy, a son of the late Robert F. Kennedy, announced in March
that he and his wife of eight years, Sheila, had separated. They
have twin sons.
   Recent polls indicated Kennedy was preferred over three
Democrats expected to seek the nomination: Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy,
former Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti and state Rep. John H.
Flood.
   Flood said Kennedy's decision ``eliminates another 800-pound
gorilla. Any Kennedy with the name, with the financial resources
and with the personality and charm they exude would have been
tremendously strong.''
   Boston University President John Silber also is considered a
likely candidate for the nomination, and Mayor Raymond L. Flynn is
considering running.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, a Democrat, is not seeking re-election.
   Kennedy was first elected in 1986 to the seat held by retiring
House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill Jr.
   Former U.S. Attorney William Weld and state House Minority
Leader Steven D. Pierce are seeking the Republican nomination.

<HEAD>Armored Police Vehicles to be Removed from Soweto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have decided to replace
the 11-ton armored cars they have been using in the black township
of Soweto with normal police vehicles, the new regional
commissioner said today.
   Maj. Gen. Johan Swart, who took up his new post on Tuesday,
urged the public in South Africa's largest city to see the change
as a tangible sign of goodwill by the police. ``I want the people
of Soweto to believe that the police only wish to carry out their
normal duties,'' Swart said.
   The armored vehicles, painted bright yellow and called Casspirs,
were a particular focus of anger during the unrest and political
violence that wracked South Africa's largest black township from
1984-86.
   They enabled policemen to see over rooftops and down the narrow
dirt streets of the townships, and to fire into crowds of
stone-throwing youths while being protected by the armor plating.
   The land-mine-proof vehicles were also used by South African
forces in the Namibian guerrilla war which ended in April.
   Swart said six Casspirs would be replaced immediately, but the
total project would be costly and take some time.
   The name Casspir is an acronym derived from the vehicles'
designers, the Council for Scientific Research and the South
African Police.
   He said he had gained the impression that Soweto was returning
to normal after the violence of a few years ago, but he said no
decision had been made on withdrawal of army troops from the
township of 2.5 million people.
   The withdrawal of white soldiers from urban black townships has
been a consistent demand of anti-apartheid activists since the
troops were sent to quell unrest in 1984.

<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry today denied that it has
agreed to let China's leading dissident and his wife leave their
safe haven in the U.S. Embassy and go into exile.
   ``The only way out for Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian is to plead
guilty immediately and mend their ways so as not to alienate
themselves from the people,'' the ministry said, according to the
official Xinhua News Agency.
   A Hong Kong magazine, Pai Shing, reported Tuesday that the
United States and China had reached an understanding to let the
couple go into exile this month, most likely in Australia. Fang and
Li took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing in June after Chinese
troops crushed massive pro-democracy protests.
   White House officials have dismissed the report, saying there
are no new developments in the case. The Australian government also
denied that a deal had been reached.
   The magazine said China agreed to let the couple leave the
country after U.S. National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft
visited Beijing in early December and sought to improve relations
badly damaged by China's crackdown on dissent and Fang's flight to
the embassy.
   But the Chinese Foreign Ministry said, ``The recent rumors about
the question of Fang Lizhi floating around abroad are speculations
pure and simple. We have repeatedly stated that Fang Lizhi and Li
Shuxian have violated the criminal law of China.
   ``It follows that this problem can only be solved according to
the laws of China. The United States, on its part, is obligated to
work for its settlement.''
   Fang, 53, an astrophysicist, and Li, a physics teacher, long
have been outspoken in their demand for democratic reforms and
respect for human rights. China has accused them of
counterrevolutionary activity.
   The United States' decision to shelter Fang has greatly strained
relations between the two countries.
   Washington criticized the suppression of the pro-democracy
movement but since has said the two countries need to set their
differences aside and improve relations.
   Pai Shing, a leading publication reporting on Chinese affairs,
said Fang would leave the embassy before Jan. 27, the start of the
Chinese Lunar New Year. The magazine said Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping approved sending Fang and his wife into exile on condition
that Fang refrain from political activities.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for two Panamanians indicted in a federal
drug trafficking case with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega charge U.S.
authorities illegally seized and returned their clients to the
United States.
   Attorneys for Lt. Col. Luis del Cid and Daniel Miranda said in
separate hearings Tuesday that the arrest and transportation to the
United States of the two violated U.S. law, the Panama Canal Treaty
and the Geneva Convention.
   Del Cid, 46, and Miranda, 36, were spirited out of Panama and
taken to Miami aboard U.S. military planes after last month's U.S.
invasion. The two are among 16 people, including Noriega, indicted
in Miami in 1988 on drug trafficking charges.
   ``This is a violation of the Panama Canal Treaty,'' Miranda's
lawyer, Michael J. O'Kane, said outside the courtroom. ``It says
that if there are any criminal acts, the defendant would be turned
over to Panamanian authorities and not surrendered to the United
States.''
   Del Cid's lawyer, Samuel Burstyn, said: ``As much as American
citizens might like to see justice done to criminals all over the
world, the United States is not an international police force. The
United States just can't go out and invade other countries and
arrest whomever it wants.''
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler ordered del Cid held
without bail for a hearing Jan. 16. Separately, U.S. Magistrate
Peter Palermo entered a plea of not guilty for Miranda and ordered
him held for a hearing Friday.
   Neither Hoeveler nor Palermo ruled on whether U.S. officials
acted within the law in arresting and returning the two Panamanians
to Miami.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said he was ``confident that when
and if the issue is presented ... we expect to prevail.''
   Miranda is accused of piloting an airplane from Fort Lauderdale
to Panama in 1983 carrying $800,000 in drug money. If convicted, he
faces up to five years in prison and $10,000 in fines.
   Del Cid is accused of acting as a liaison and money courier
between drug traffickers and Noriega. The charges carry up to 70
years in prison and $550,000 in fines.
   Noriega, ousted from power by the invasion, remains a fugitive
and has taken refuge in the Vatican Embassy in Panama.
   The deposed dictator is charged with using his position to
create a safe haven for cocaine traffickers. If brought to Miami
and convicted he could receive 145 years in prison and more than $1
million in fines.
   In addition, Noriega was indicted in 1988 by another federal
grand jury, in Tampa. He was charged with accepting a $5.4 million
bribe from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel.

   Modrow's effort to appease disgruntled leaders of the New Forum
reform movement prevented the collapse of talks between the
government and opposition groups as part of the ruling process
until elections in May. The talks are preparing drafts of proposed
legislative and constitutional reforms.
   On May 6, the first free balloting in the nation's 40-year
history will select a 500-member Parliament, which in turn will
seat a new government.
   Because opposition forces view Modrow's Communist-dominated
Cabinet as transitional, they contend its powers are limited and
that decisions affecting important areas of national policy should
take into consideration the views of grass-roots reform movements.
   Modrow sent Economics Minister Christa Luft to today's session
of the talks to assure the nearly 20 political parties and
citizens' movements represented there that they would be consulted
regularly through May 6. In an apparent good-faith gesture, Ms.
Luft gave a detailed and gloomy account of the national economy in
light of East Germany's $20.6 billion foreign debt.
   That makes the per capita debt higher than in Poland.
   But West German economic experts, who had previously disclosed
the foreign debt figure, say East Germany's overall economic
profile is much better than that of Poland or Hungary _ two other
Eastern European nations struggling to carry out democratic and
economic reforms.
   Modrow on Tuesday invited representatives at the talks to form
an advisory committee to work with his government. New Forum
leaders had threatened to withdraw from the talks, a move Modrow
strongly opposed.
   ``If we do not succeed in building a climate of mutual trust, we
will not have the proper climate for the May 6 elections, either,''
the official ADN news agency quoted him as saying.
   The date for elections was determined at the first round of
talks Dec. 7.
   Reinhard Schult of the East Berlin chapter of New Forum, which
claims 200,000 members nationwide, complained at a news conference
late Tuesday that Modrow's Cabinet has failed to keep the reform
activists informed about ecological, political and financial
matters. The group has specifically complained about East German
officials' agreeing to work with West German firms to improve
nuclear power plant operations and output.
   East Germans have been swept into a whirlwind of reform over the
past three months, since massive pro-democracy marches by New Forum
and other groups forced hard-liner Erich Honecker from the
Communist Party leadership Oct. 18.
   The party, which has dominated social and political affairs
throughout East German statehood, relinquished its constitutional
mandate to rule on Dec. 1, thereby reducing the Communists to the
same status as other political parties.
   Modrow, a long-time advocate of reform, enjoys broader support
among East Germans than any other Communist figure. But opposition
leaders contend his government has no legitimacy as it was seated
by the Communist-controlled Parliament prior to the decline of the
party.

   U.S. efforts to pry ousted Panamanian dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega from the Vatican Embassy in Panama City may
be indirectly complicating the fate of another embassy fugitive a
world away, Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi.
   A senior Bush administration official familiar with developments
in China said the Beijing government appears to be ``watching
closely'' to see how the Noriega episode plays out _ and watching
with some sense of irony.
   Fang has been sheltered in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing since the
Tiananmen Square crackdown last June.
   So far, the United States has shown no more inclination to turn
Fang over to Chinese officials, who want to arrest him, than the
Vatican has displayed in responding to U.S. demands for Noriega.
   The administration official, who did not wish to be quoted by
name, suggested China might first want to see how Noriega's
situation is resolved before getting involved in any plan to free
Fang to a third country.
   Bush administration officials on Tuesday dismissed a report in a
Hong Kong magazine that Fang might soon be permitted to go into
exile in Australia or another country. ``He's still in the embassy.
There have been no new developments,'' White House spokesman Roman
Popadiuk said.
   The magazine, the Chinese-language Pai Shino, said the United
States and China reached an ``understanding'' on ending the
stalemate when national security adviser Brent Scowcroft visited
Beijing last month.
   Scowcroft said through White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater that ``there's no indication of a deal.''
   The Chinese Foreign Ministry also denied the report. ``The only
way out for Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian (Fang's wife) is to plead
guilty immediately and mend their ways so as not to alienate
themselves from the people,'' the ministry said today, according to
the official Xinhua News Agency.
   Likewise, a spokesman for the Australian Foreign Ministry in
Canberra said today there was no basis to the story.
   ``There has been no deal, no approach or suggestion that he
should come to Australia,'' said the official, who by custom could
not be identified. ``We have not been involved in any negotiations
or discussions.''
   The official said special Foreign Ministry envoy Michael
Costello was in Beijing recently but that the issue of Fang's
possible release was not discussed.
   But there's no doubt the United States wants to resolve the
stalemate, rather than having Fang and his wife live in the embassy
for the rest of their lives.
   The Bush administration considers Fang, an astrophysicist, a
victim of political persecution but sees Noriega as a ``thug'' and
indicted drug-dealer. Still, there are some parallels and that is
forcing the United States to make different arguments for different
hemispheres.
   Although U.S. officials would welcome a third-country solution
for Fang, they have ruled one out for Noriega. Too many American
servicemen have died in Panama for the United States to now
consider permitting Noriega a safe haven, President Bush has said.
   While firmly refusing to turn over Fang to Chinese authorities,
the United States has leaned hard on the Roman Catholic Church to
turn over Noriega _ not to Panama, but to Americans.
   But the Vatican has said it is under no obligation to release
Noriega to an ``occupying power.''
   In its pursuit of Noriega, the United States has kept troops
outside the Vatican Embassy and even bombarded it with loud rock
music. ``It would have aggravated me, I'll tell you,'' Bush said
after he ordered it turned off.
   The United States also raided the home of the Nicaraguan
ambassador in Panama City on a tip that there was a large cache of
arms there.
   Although the United States apologized for the intrusion and Bush
called it a ``screw-up,'' the episode could undermine the
administration's arguments to the Chinese about the sanctity of
foreign embassy grounds.
   Dealings between the United States and the government of China
are extremely fragile; and Scowcroft's two clandestine missions to
Beijing _ the first a bare month after the bloody crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators and the second last month _ have been
roundly denounced by congressional Democrats and many Republicans.
   Thus, seeking to arrange a deal with China on Fang's fate is ``a
very sensitive matter,'' State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher
said.
   And that the United States must use one set of arguments in
Panama City and another in Beijing can only make the efforts to
free Fang even more delicate.

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Julio Gallo, co-owner of the world's
largest winery, was reported in stable condition this morning after
being injured in a car crash that killed a woman.
   Earlier reports said Gallo, 79, suffered serious head injuries,
but his condition was upgraded overnight from guarded to stable,
said San Jose Medical Center shift director Carolyn Ingraham.
   ``We were told to give out only that he sustained some
injuries,'' she said. ``If it were more serious, he wouldn't be
stable.''
   Gallo's wife, Eileen, 74, also was in stable condition, Ingraham
said.
   Highway Patrol Officer Tom Melden said Mrs. Gallo was driving
when the couple's luxury sedan veered across the center line
Tuesday afternoon and struck a compact car on a windy, mountain
road.
   Sharon Kauk, 27, of San Jose was killed. Her 27-year-old husband
and their 6-month-old son were listed in stable condition at Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center.
   Melden said it appeared Mrs. Gallo was at fault in the accident,
but added, ``Mrs. Gallo had no signs whatsoever of alcohol or
drugs.'' No charges had been filed.
   Gallo and his brother Ernest control a company with more than $1
billion a year in sales and a 28 percent share of the U.S. wine
market.

   The government said today it has
suspended talks to buy foreign arms in a move to block military
supplies to renegade Gen. Michel Aoun, who acknowledged having more
than $15 million in French bank accounts.
   Also today, unidentified assailants attacked the house belonging
to the chief of military police in the Christian enclave, a senior
Aoun aide, in an apparent assassination attempt that killed at
least five people, police said.
   And in southern Lebanon, rival Shiite Moslem militias battled
into a 12th day for supremacy, despite a unilateral cease-fire
declared by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Six people were killed, 18 wounded and 10,000 villagers fled
their homes in the embattled Apple Province southeast the port city
of Sidon, police said.
   That raised the overall toll to 70 killed and 252 wounded since
the fighting began Dec. 23, pitting the fundamentalist Hezbollah
against the pro-Syrian, secular Amal, which is Arabic for hope.
   Lebanese diplomatic missions in Washington, Paris, Rome,
Brussels and Amsterdam have been instructed to ``freeze current and
scheduled negotiations for arms, spare parts and ammunition'' for
the Lebanese army, a government statement said.
   All military shipments to the Lebanese army have been halted and
all funds earmarked to the military attache's office of these
missions were suspended, the statement said. It mentioned no
figures.
   The statement was released by the press office of Prime Minister
Salim Hoss, who doubles as foreign minister in President Elias
Hrawi's 6-week-old government of national reconcliation.
   The move appeared aimed at preventing Aoun from replenishing the
arms lost in six months of shelling duels with the Syrian army
across Beirut last year.
   Hrawi fired Aoun as military commander and interim prime
minister in November. But Aoun held out with 20,000 troops in the
Christian enclave north and northeast of Beirut, refusing to hand
over the presidential palace to Hrawi.
   Aoun acknowledged having millions of dollars in foreign bank
accounts, following a report today by the satirical French weekly
Le Canard Enchaine. The magazine published a reproduction of a bank
statement showing two accounts in Aoun's name at the Banque
Nationale de Paris, one with a balance of $500,000, the other with
$14.7 million.
   ``It's not a secret for anyone. It's an open secret,'' Aoun said
in an interview on France's state-run radio station France-Inter.
He said he had accounts in other French banks, as well as in the
United States and Lebanon.
   The general said the funds in the accounts came from donations
and were not for his private use.
   ``If necessary, I can withdraw the money needed to resolve
financial crises,'' he said. ``For the last year and three months,
I have received no money from the central bank as concerns the
army.''
   In the mountain resort town of Beit Meri, the military police
chief, Lt. Col. Adel Sassin, escaped unhurt as his guards battled
off attackers at his house, said a police spokesman who cannot be
named under standing rules.
   It was the first such assault on a senior aide to Aoun since the
general rebelled against Hrawi's internationally recognized
government. Five people were killed, four of them soldiers guarding
the house. The fifth was believed to be one of the attackers,
police said.
   The attack came amid a growing rift within Christian ranks over
Aoun's rejection of an Arab League-brokered peace plan under which
Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic like Aoun, was elected president by
Parliament to try to halt Lebanon's civil war.

   Two men who spent eight days adrift
after their boat's engine failed stayed alive by rationing their
meager liquid and food, including shrimp they had brought as bait,
the Coast Guard says.
   Jose D. Espinal, 30, and Ceferino H. Guzman, 26, left West Palm
Beach, Fla., on Dec. 23 for the short trip to Miami, where they
were to deliver the boat to its owner, said Steve Atkins, a Coast
Guard spokesman in Boston.
   A Navy ship dropped the men off in Portsmouth on Tuesday after
picking them up early Sunday hundreds of miles off course, between
Savannah, Ga., and Jacksonville, Fla., Atkins said.
   He said the men, temporary U.S. residents from the Dominican
Republican, had no medical problems.
   Because the trip from West Palm Beach to Miami usually takes
only a few hours, the men had only a bottle of soda, cookies,
cheese and the shrimp, he said.
   Their 22-foot fiberglass boat was left at sea, and Espinal, who
had 17 years' of fishing experience, said he planned to stay on
land from now on, Atkins said.

<HEAD>Fundamentalist Leader Goes on Trial in Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the Moslem
fundamentalist Hamas movement went on trial in a military court
today with relatives of a slain Israeli soldier shrieking curses at
him.
   Sheik Ahmed Ismail Yassin, 54, was charged with 15 offenses,
including belonging to an illegal organization, organizing attacks
on civilians and causing the deaths of two Israeli soldiers, Ilan
Saadon and Avi Sassportaz.
   ``I deny all charges,'' Yassin whispered to reporters in the
courtroom in Gaza City in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   However, his lawyer, Abdul Malik Bahanshe, told the court that
Yassin founded Hamas, or Zeal, and helped transfer funds to the
organization.
   ``My client says it is not just his right but his obligation to
establish these organizations to battle the occupation,'' Bahanshe
said. ``He's also not sorry for what he did.''
   Hamas was founded within a month after the Palestinian uprising
against occupation began in December 1987. The Gaza Strip and West
Bank have been occupied by Israel since they were captured from
Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Government officials did not move quickly against Hamas,
apparently believing it would sap support from the Palestine
Liberation Organization. Hamas was declared illegal in September,
and Yassin was arrested in November.
   Yassin's lawyers told the court they will contest several points
in the charges. They were granted an indefinite postponement after
requesting time to study the charges fully. Israel radio said the
trial was expected to last two months.
   The bearded Yassin, paralyzed since a childhood sporting
accident, sat impassively in his wheelchair through today's session
despite repeated outbursts from the family of Saadon.
   ``God will pay him back!'' Saadon's mother shouted, gesturing
toward Yassin.
   ``He knows where my boy is!'' she screamed. ``I don't even have
a grave to weep at.''
   Saadon, 18, was kidnapped May 5 and the army announced he was
killed, but his body has never been found. The other soldier,
Sassportaz, 21, was kidnapped in February and his body was found in
the Gaza Strip on May 8.
   After the outburst, Mrs. Saadon was seen crying as military
police led her from the courtroom.

   Helicopters sprayed chemicals on a
100-square-mile oil slick today and patrol boats lay floating
barriers in an effort to keep the goo away from the coastline,
where marine life and beaches were threatened.
   About 19 million gallons of crude oil have spewed into the
Atlantic Ocean from the Iranian tanker Khark 5 since an explosion
tore through its hull Dec. 19. The slick was 20 miles from the
Moroccan coast.
   In Paris, French Environment Minister Brice Lalonde said the
284,632-ton tanker was being towed to more sheltered waters but
still posed a threat to marine life.
   Environmental experts said high waves broke up much of the oil
and that it dissolved in the 60-degree seas.
   Spokesman Daan Kaakebeen of the Dutch salvage firm Smit Tak said
there had been no leakage for 24 hours. But Morocco's official news
agency, Maghreb Arabe Presse, said about 530 gallons continued to
escape each hour.
   Three tugboats under command of Smit Tak were towing the ship
toward calmer waters near the Cape Verde islands, a journey
expected to take eight days. Morocco and Spain have refused to
allow the vessel to be towed near sheltered waters off their coasts.
   Salvagers hoped the remaining cargo could be pumped into another
Iranian tanker at Cape Verde.
   ``I'm concerned not only with what's going to happen to the
Moroccan coast...but with what's going to happen to the tanker now
that it's on the open seas,'' Lalonde said on the French television
station Antenne 2. He was in the former French colony to assess the
spill.
   Kaakebeen said the Khark 5 was 130 miles off the Moroccan coast
and that fair weather has reduced chances of it breaking up.
   The oil threatened oyster beds, fishing stocks, a pink flamingo
breeding ground and resort beaches. Officials said 100,000 jobs
depend on fishing and tourism there.
   Technicians laid floating cable to block the slick's advance.
Cleanup crews vacuumed the floating oil, which then was transferred
to barges, and helicopters sprayed chemicals to break up the spill
and make it sink, Maghreb said.
   Kaakebeen said the tanker has 14 oil storage tanks. He estimated
the ship lost up to 60,000 tons of its original cargo.
   He said Morocco and Spain have refused to allow the Khark 5 to
be towed near their shores.
   Joe Nichols, technical manager of the International Tanker
Owners Pollution Federation, said the scale of the disaster would
not approach last year's Exxon Valdez catastrophe, when 11 million
gallons of Alaskan crude spoiled 1,000 miles of pristine coastline
in Prince William Sound.
   ``It is absolute poppycock to say this is one of the world's
worst disasters,'' Nichols said.
   ``It is not the quantity of oil that matters but the location of
the spill and the prevailing conditions,'' he said. ``It was a
significant spillage but it took place about 150 miles offshore.''
   The Khark 5 was loaded with 72 million gallons of oil when an
explosion tore through its hull Dec. 19 about 400 miles north of
Las Palmas in the Canary Islands.
   The cause of the blast is unknown. A fire forced the crew of 35
to abandon ship and the vessel began drifting toward northwest
Africa.
   Hassan Mohammedi, a spokesman for Iran's environmental
protection agency, said the incident had been exaggerated by ``the
imperialist media.''
   ``It is normal for such accidents to occur in stormy
conditions,'' Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted
him as saying. ``This is an ordinary matter.''

   A high-profile prosecutor who often
accompanies detectives on drug raids said he barely escaped an
assassination attempt by fleeing in his car and shooting one of his
assailants in the head.
   ``Thank God I'm alive,'' Camden County Prosecutor Samuel Asbell
told reporters Tuesday. ``I guess it just wasn't my day or my
time.''
   Asbell said two gunmen followed him as he drove from his office
on New Year's Day, then opened fire. He was sprayed with glass from
his windows but was not seriously injured.
   The assailants pursued him in a green Toyota station wagon and
fired at him in his car as he left his downtown office about 5 p.m.
Monday, Asbell said. He said he was in his office on New Year's Day
to catch up on paperwork.
   When the gunmen opened fire, Asbell said, he fired one round
from a 12-gauge sawed-off shotgun, striking the passenger, and then
got off seven rounds from his semiautomatic handgun, he said. Both
of his weapons are registered, he added.
   ``I had my shotgun on my lap and I just let go,'' Asbell said.
   ``I saw his head explode.''
   The gunmen have not been found, the prosecutor said.
   Asbell's office is leading the investigation into the attack.
   State police and the attorney general's office also are
investigating.
   ``The state is approaching this as a very serious incident,''
said Chuck Davis, a spokesman for the state attorney general.
``They're looking at whether it was just a bump-and-rob type, and
they're looking at whether it was some sort of narcotics
terrorism.''
   Asbell said the gunmen shot out the windows of his unmarked
county-issued Lincoln Towncar with a MAC-10 automatic weapon. The
prosecutor was cut on his hands from the shattered glass, but did
not require medical treatment.
   ``The car that I was driving looks like a piece of Swiss
cheese,'' Asbell said. ``All I know is my back windows blew into my
head.
   ``I was combing glass out of my head all night.''
   Asbell and his family have been placed under 24-hour State
Police protection. The prosecutor said he was unable to identify
the attackers or get the license number of their car. He said the
area was deserted at the time and that he does not believe there
were any witnesses to the attack.
   Known for his tough stance on drugs, Asbell often goes with
detectives on drug raids in the city. Last year, drug arrests
quadrupled, according to Asbell, who was appointed county
prosecutor in 1984 by Gov. Thomas H. Kean.
   Asbell, while in private practice, was shot in the chest in 1970
while representing a client whose property was put up for sheriff's
sale. The bullet is still lodged in his chest.
   ``I'm a hands-on prosecutor,'' Asbell said. ``The public knows
me. If they know me, the drug dealers know me.''
   The prosecutor said he fled, leading his assailants on a
three-to four-mile chase traveling 80 to 100 mph through downtown
and a deserted industrial park. Asbell said that after the Toyota
passed him, he stopped his car and fired the shotgun and the
handgun at the vehicle.
   State police spokesman Daniel Cosgrove said the department's
crime scene unit has taken custody of the prosecutor's car and
planned to photograph it and extract bullets from it.
   He would not provide details of the investigation.
   Asbell said he usually travels alone but changes his route
several times a week. He said he receives numerous telephone and
mail threats weekly and always carries a weapon.
   He said he used poor judgment in going into the deserted office
on the holiday.
   ``It was stupid,'' he said.

<HEAD>Aquino Swears In Nine New Cabinet Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino swore in
nine new Cabinet members today and appealed for teamwork to solve
the Philippines' problems in the wake of last month's bloody coup
attempt.
   Using her emergency powers, Mrs. Aquino ordered that all
firearms be registered anew, voiding the previous master list of
people or entities with gun licenses.
   Also today, opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile denied allegations
he was linked to the coup attempt, which lasted Dec. 1-9, and said
the charges against him were a witchhunt aimed at eliminating Mrs.
Aquino's opponents.
   The new Cabinet members taking their oaths of office at the
Malacanang presidential palace included the newly designated
secretaries of justice, agriculture, education, transport, finance,
agrarian reform, and Mrs. Aquino's press secretary, legal affairs
adviser and military adviser.
   ``We have only 800 days left (in office), and we must be able to
deliver to the people the services they so justly deserve,'' Mrs.
Aquino said after the ceremony.
   Tomas Gomez, who was sworn in as press secretary, said Mrs.
Aquino stressed the need for cooperation during the closed-door
Cabinet meeting which followed the oath-taking.
   ``The president reiterated team spirit, and I was impressed
because I thought there was a conscious attempt to reach out and
achieve that team spirit and coordination,'' said Gomez, a former
Philippine consul in Honolulu.
   Gomez quoted Mrs. Aquino as telling the Cabinet to ``please give
me a very speedy action line.''
   Mrs. Aquino revamped her Cabinet on Sunday after widespread
criticism that her administration had failed to address the
nation's social, economic and political problems.
   Those demands reached a climax last month when thousands of
military mutineers launched the sixth and strongest attempt so far
to topple Mrs. Aquino since she took office in February 1986.
   Congress expanded the powers of a commission investigating the
uprising, giving it the right, among other things, to look into
bank accounts of suspected putsch supporters.
   A consolidated version of bills from the Senate and House of
Representatives creating the commission was passed in both
chambers, called into special session by Mrs. Aquino to approve the
legislation.
   Sen. Jose Lina said the commission would investigate last
month's coup attempt and recommend ``measures which will prevent
similar attempts at a violent seizure of power.''
   The bill gives the commission quasi-judicial powers, including
the right to grant immunity from prosecution to witnesses. It
protects witnesses against self-incrimination in testimony they are
forced to give before the commission.
   It also allows the commission to require the Monetary Board to
disclose information or grant authority to examine bank accounts if
it has ``reasonable ground'' to believe the funds were used in the
coup attempt.

<HEAD>Scientists: Soviets Figured Out the H-Bomb With Little Help From
Spy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atom spy Klaus Fuchs did practically nothing to
help the Soviets develop a hydrogen bomb because much of what he
passed along was faulty data, nuclear experts have concluded.
   The New York Times today reported that those experts _ in a
series of recent books and journal articles _ suggested that the
Soviets learned more about how to make the weapon by analyzing
fallout from American H-bomb tests.
   According to the researchers, the material Fuchs gave the
Soviets came from flawed early work by Edward Teller, who has been
described at the father of the hydrogen bomb.
   It was long believed that Fuchs, a British subject and physicist
who worked on the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb
during World War II, gave the Soviets the secret to the H-bomb.
   He confessed to spying in 1950. He was imprisoned and later
released. He died in East Germany in January. The United States
exploded the world's first hydrogen bomb in 1952; the Soviets
detonated their first full-scale H-bomb in 1955.
   The researchers, relying in part on a declassified version of a
top-secret history of the H-bomb program, said that Fuchs left the
U.S. weapons program in 1946 and thus had access only to faulty
assumptions and calculations that plagued the program in its early
years.
   The revisionist researchers, working independently, included
Daniel Hirsch and William G. Matthews, writing on Fuchs and the
fallout question in the January issue of The Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists; Thomas B. Cochran and Robert S. Norris, authors of
``The Nuclear Weapons Databook''; Chuck Hanson, author of ``U.S.
Nuclear Weapons: The Secret History,'' and Stanley B. Blumberg and
Louis G. Panos, authors of the upcoming book ``Edward Teller.''

<HEAD>Dentist Tattooed `Remember Pearl Harbor' on Tojo's False Teeth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POMPANO BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. George Clark Foster, who got into
trouble with the Navy for engraving ``Remember Pearl Harbor'' in
Morse code on dentures for imprisoned Japanese Gen. Hideki Tojo,
has died at age 68.
   Foster, who died at a nursing home Saturday of undisclosed
causes, was head of dental surgery at Sugamo Prison in Tokyo when
he tattooed his patient's false teeth in 1947 as a practical joke.
When the story leaked, the prank cost the Navy oral surgeon a
commendation but tickled the nation.
   ``Needless to say, our sentiment toward the Japanese was not the
most favorable so soon after World War II,'' Foster wrote in 1988.
``I figured it was my duty to carry out the assignment. But that
didn't mean I couldn't have fun with it.''
   Tojo, who as Japanese premier had been a prime architect of his
nation's war strategy, had asked for new teeth so he could speak
better at his war crimes trial.
   Foster was ordered to repair the doctored set, which he did, and
Tojo wore them until his execution in 1948.
   Foster practiced in Fort Lauderdale until his retirement in 1985.
   Survivors include his wife, three daughters, his mother and a
brother.
   A memorial service was scheduled for today.

   The Pentagon today defended plans to take over
millions of additional acres of public lands for combat training,
arguing that more room is needed to train soldiers and pilots in
the use of modern weaponry.
   The expansion plans have been sharply criticized by
environmentalists and ranchers, especially in Western states where
more than 3 million additional acres are sought by the Defense
Department for expanded bombing runs and tank maneuvers.
   Testifying before a House Interior subcommittee, Pentagon
officials said modern technology requires exanded training areas
``to provide the realism'' of combat.
   ``Today's high-speed modern tactical aircraft fly over large
ground ranges in a matter of seconds. ... Today a mechanized Army
battalion needs more than 80,000 acres to practice standard
maneuvers, compared to 4,000 acres during World War II,'' said
Robert Stone, deputy assistant defense secretary for installations.
   But the military's grab for land has sparked controversy across
much of the West, from Montana to California, and also in
Mississippi, where the state National Guard thinks the DeSoto
National Forest is just the place for tank maneuvers.
   Among critics called to appear later at the hearing were several
Idaho and Montana ranchers as well as representatives from
environmental and citizen groups who argue the military is locking
the public out of too many acres of federal land.
   Several congressmen said, however, that defense needs might have
to override other concerns.
   Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, in whose state the Air Force wants to
vastly expand a bombing range, said that while local interests must
be taken into account it also ``is critical to the country'' that
the military training is the best it can be.
   The military currently uses more than 19 million acres of land
belonging to the federal Bureau of Land Management or the U.S.
Forest Service. It wants to expand those holdings by 3.4 million
acres in seven western states alone, according to congressional
estimates.
   ``The growing appetite for more public lands on which to
practice war games appears to be out of sync with the warming of
relations between the U.S. and the Soviet bloc,'' said Rep. Bruce
Vento, D-Minn., chairman of the national parks and public lands
subcommittee.
   The Forest Service and the BLM have not publicly protested the
Defense Department's intentions. ``Within the administration, the
DOD is like a 600-pound gorilla and gets its way,'' Vento said in
an interview Tuesday.
   But in some regions the push to expand military training bases
has prompted a modern-day range war between the military and an
unusual alliance of environmentalists, cattlemen and citizens'
groups.
   In Idaho, a plan by the Air Force to vastly expand the Saylor
Creek bombing range from 100,000 acres to 1.5 million acres is
prompting loud protests. Ranchers say the expansion will drive them
out of desirable grazing land on the high plateau;
environmentalists argue the bombing will ruin the countryside and
destroy a valuable wildlife habitat.
   Roger Hayes, who represents several Idaho environmental groups,
said some of the miles of the scenic land coveted by the Air Force
already is being considered for wilderness protection status. It is
home to a wide array of birds and wildlife including the bald eagle
and nearly one-third of the world's population of California
bighorn sheep, he said.
   That's one reason the Air Force wants to take over 500,000
additional acres along the Nevada-Utah border where plans call for
a new ``electronic battlefield'' for jet fighters.
   The Navy also wants 240,000 acres of public land in Nevada for
``range and air crew training,'' while Nevada's Army Guard has set
its sights on 586,000 acres of public grazing land for tank
training.
   Bob Fulkerson, executive director of Citizen Alert, a
Nevada-based environmental group, says the military is ``empire
building'' and maintains the training plans would lock up 4 million
acres of federal land now available to the public and wildlife.
   Large areas of land also are being sought for National Guard
training in Montana, where up to 900,000 acres are in question, and
in Mississippi where the state National Guard wants to expand Camp
Shelby onto the nearby 116,000-acre DeSoto National Forest. The
additional land would be used for tank maneuvers by Guard units
from a number of states.

   The Coast Guard today said it is investigating
whether dozens of barges torn from their moorings by rushing chunks
of ice in the rain- and snow-swollen Monongahela River had been
secured properly.
   The operators of the mooring areas in the 58-mile stretch of
river where at least 55 barges broke away New Year's Day could be
fined up to $1,000 per vessel, Cmdr. Tony Regalbuto said. The Coast
Guard on Dec. 26 had warned operators a thaw was expected by the
weekend, Regalbuto said.
   ``They knew this was coming,'' said Paul Behers, spokesman for
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources.
   ``They are presumed negligent because you don't expect a barge
that's fixed to the shore to break away on its own,'' Regalbuto
said.
   In crashing downstream, one of the barges spilled 10,000 gallons
of gasoline, although state officials said environmental damage was
slight. Another barge holding 420,000 gallons of fuel was pried
from a dam Tuesday, its cargo intact.
   Thirty of the barges sank, prompting the Coast Guard to halt
river traffic along a 20-mile stretch south of Pittsburgh. Some of
the submerged vessels were empty; others carried coal. The river
will reopen as soon as all the sunken barges are located, possibly
by Thursday, said Coast Guard Lt. Rhae Giacoma.
   The Coast Guard planned to scan the closed portion of the river
this evening after receiving sonar equipment from the Army Corps of
Engineers.
   In New Jersey, about 5,000 gallons of heating oil spilled from a
pipe linking an Exxon Corp. plant in Linden with its refinery in
Bayonne.
   The break Tuesday caused an 11-mile slick that tainted six miles
of shoreline on New York's Staten Island, officials said.
   John Hagerty, spokesman for the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection, said no environmentally sensitive areas
were threatened by the spill, which occurred in an area ringed with
industrial plants and oil terminals.
   The gasoline that spilled in Pennsylvania was on a barge that
drifted from Mon River Towing Inc.'s dock at Speers, 44 miles
upstream from Pittsburgh, over the locks and dam at Charleroi, 28
miles south of Pittsburgh. It hit the Monongahela Bridge before
coming to rest at New Eagle, 14 miles farther downstream.
   Two other barges broke loose from Mon River Towing, 15 from an
LTV Steel Co. facility three miles upstream from Pittsburgh and 37
from LaBelle Processing Co.
   The spilled gasoline drifted down the Ohio River to Ohio and
West Virginia today, becoming more diluted with every mile.
   ``The farther it goes, the less pronounced it would be,'' Behers
said.

<TEXT>
   A spokesman for the Contra rebels
today dismissed government allegations the U.S.-backed rebels were
responsible for an ambush that killed two nuns, including an
American, and injured an American bishop.
   The body of Sister Maureen Courtney, of Milwaukee, arrived in
Managua on Tuesday night before being flown to the United States.
   The attack occurred Monday in a remote area of Zelaya province,
250 miles northeast of Managua, as Sister Courtney and three other
church workers drove in a church pickup truck from the town of
Rosita to Puerto Cabezas.
   ``I only know that a mine went off or a grenade and there was
heavy shooting afterward,'' said Bishop Pablo Schmitz of Fond du
Lac, Wis. ``We identified ourselves, but nobody came to the
pickup.''
   Schmitz, the auxiliary bishop of the port city of Bluefields,
told reporters ``it was very dark outside'' when the attack
occurred, so he could not identify the assailants.
   Church officials said it was possible the pickup may have hit a
land mine, but Schmitz also suffered a gunshot wound to the left
arm. Sister Francisca Colomer, 24, of Nicaragua, suffered wounds in
the face and body. Both were hospitalized in Managua and were
expected to survive.
   Sister Courtney, 45, was of the Sisters of St. Agnes order of
Fond du Lac and had been doing missionary work in Nicaragua 15
years. She was believed to be the first American killed in the
9-year-old civil war since Contras killed 27-year-old engineer
Benjamin Linder, of Portland, Ore., in April 1987.
   The slain Nicaraguan nun was identified as Sister Teresa
Rosales, of Santa Marta.
   The incident comes at a time of tense U.S.-Nicaraguan relations,
which took a turn for the worse after the American invasion of
Panama and U.S. soldiers' illegal search of the Nicaraguan
ambassador's residence.
   Contra military leader Enrique Bermudez said in Miami this
morning that he doubted Contras were responsible for the ambush.
   ``We have not received any report from patrols of that kind of
action,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``These type of
accusations are normally made by the Sandinistas in order to (wage
a) publicity campaign against us.''
   He said Contras did not have a presence in the area where the
attack occurred.
   However, the regional deputy police commander, Julio Rugama,
said about 60 Contra rebels operate in the region and were
responsible for the attack.
   The New York Times today quoted Lt. Col. Juan Lorenzo Santana as
saying the church workers were apparently attacked because they
came upon a group of Contras planting a mine in the road.
   And Jaime Arauz, one of two peasants questioned by Sandinista
officials, told reporters he and the other peasant were kidnapped
by a group of rebels who told them they were waiting to ambush an
army convoy.
   The government radio Voz de Nicaragua said the attackers were
``Contra forces encouraged by the invasion of U.S. troops in
Panama.''
   U.S. soldiers invaded Panama on Dec. 20 and ousted the regime of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, then surrounded the Nicaraguan Embassy
in case Noriega decided to seek refuge there.
   Later that week, U.S. soldiers searched the Panama City
residence of Nicaragua's ambassador, Antenor Ferrey. Washington
admitted the search of the diplomatic premises was a mistake.
Nicaragua expelled 20 American diplomats from Managua in
retaliation.
   The area where the attack occurred is a stronghold of the
Miskito Indians, who for years have mounted sporadic military
operations against the Sandinistas, independent of the Contras.
   Norma Venkler, a classmate of Maureen Courtney in the 1960s at
Divine Savior Holy Angels High School in Milwaukee, said her friend
was setting up an education system for the Miskito Indians.
   Frances Courtney, Sister Courtney's mother, told journalists in
Wauwatosa, Wis., that her daughter had been in Nicaragua for 15
years.
   ``She was supposed to celebrate her 25th jubilee in the order
this December,'' the mother said. ``She was just a lovely little
girl.''
   Sister Jean Steffes, mother superior for the Sisters of St.
Agnes, said in Wisconsin that it was the first time members of her
order were killed doing missionary work.
   Schmitz went to Nicaragua as a missionary in 1972 and was
ordained auxiliary bishop in 1984 and belonged to the Capuchin
order of the Franciscans, according to Brother Larry La Cross, a
Capuchin spokesman in Detroit.
   About 35 Capuchin missionaries work in Nicaragua.
   The U.S.-backed Contras began their fight against the Nicaraguan
government in 1981, saying the Sandinistas had betrayed the popular
revolution that toppled Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   A fragile cease-fire ended on Nov. 1, 1988, and fighting has
been sporadic since. U.S. military aid to the Contras ran out in
February 1988, but Congress has continued to provide non-lethal aid.
   President Bush has said he wants to keep the Contras intact to
ensure that the Sandinistas remain true to their promise of free
elections on Feb. 25.
   The radio said President Daniel Ortega visited the victims
Tuesday night to express his condolences.

   A judge reversed himself and admitted reporters
to jury selection today in a lawsuit by a doctor who claims she
contracted AIDS from pricking her finger with a needle.
   Supreme Court Justice Aaron D. Bernstein had said Tuesday that
potential jurors might be reluctant to answer personal questions
about AIDS if reporters were present, and he barred them from court.
   The judge backed down after meeting with lawyers from the New
York Post, but he told potential jurors that they could go to his
chambers to answer any questions that they considered personal or
embarrassing.
   Dr. Veronica Prego, 32, is suing Kings County Hospital and its
parent agency, the city Health and Hospitals Corp.; the city and
two doctors for $175 million, alleging negligence.
   Prego said she was working under a physician and cleaning up
after an intern seven years ago when she reached into a tangle of
gauze and bed linens in which the intern had left a bloody needle.
   Two years ago she was diagnosed as having AIDS.
   The HHC, which operates the city's hospitals, disputes Prego's
version of events but has refused to discuss specifics of the case.

<NOTE>Eds: Top 7 grafs new with Bush Likely to Propose Tax to Encourage
Recycling. Picks up 3rd graf pvs, This is.</NOTE>

   President Bush, who has pledged repeatedly not
to raise taxes, is likely to propose a levy on industry for the use
of certain raw materials to encourage recycling, administration
sources said today.
   The proposal is expected to be part of Bush's fiscal 1991 budget
blueprint, which he will present to Congress Jan. 29, said
officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Bush pledged repeatedly in the 1988 campaign and again last year
not to raise taxes. He said a few weeks ago in a year-end interview
that he hoped to stick with that resolution. The sources said they
considered a levy on raw materials for recycling more in the nature
of a user fee than a tax.
   The aim of the proposal, first reported by the Wall Street
Journal in today's editions, would be to make it cheaper for
industries to use recycled, rather than new, materials.
   ``We want to encourage recycling, for obvious reasons,'' said
deputy White House press secretary Stephen Hart. He declined to
discuss the proposal but said work is underway in the
administration to produce a major recycling package next year.
   In other budget developments, congressional sources said Tuesday
that Bush will ask Congress to cut the Low Income Home Energy
Assistance Program, which helps the poor pay their heating bills,
from $1.39 billion this year to $1.05 billion for fiscal 1991.
   ``This is a program that is terribly inadequately funded
already,'' said Charles Hill, managing attorney for the National
Consumer Law Center in Washington.
   About 6.1 million American households receive assistance under
the program, about one-third the total that qualify for the aid,
supporters say. The 1991 fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
   Federal energy assistance to the poor, which started soon after
the 1973 Arab oil embargo, peaked at $2.1 billion in 1985 when 6.8
million households were served. It has been cut steadily ever since
as it became a favorite target for proposed reductions during the
Reagan administration.
   ``This program has been cut enough over the last few years,''
said Ed Block, executive director of the National Association of
Community Action Programs.
   The program helps poor families and individuals pay part of
their heating bills. Some money also is used to help the poor cover
air conditioning and insulating expenses and to aid families in
danger of losing their heating service. About half of the
households served include elderly or disabled people.
   Spokeswoman Barbara Clay of the Office of Management and Budget
declined to comment on the proposal. Margot Simmons, spokeswoman
for the Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the
heating aid program, also declined comment.
   Supporters of the program said there is no way to predict how
the proposed cuts, if enacted, would affect people who receive
assistance. The federal government funnels the money to the states,
territories and Indian tribes, which are free to set their own
criteria for distribution. In the past, some states have responded
to cutbacks by reducing the number of eligible recipients, while
others have shrunk the size of benefits.
   The program has widespread support in Congress, where Bush's
proposal is likely to be strongly opposed. Last year, Bush proposed
providing $1.1 billion for the program, but lawmakers ended up
setting aside $1.39 billion.
   Word of the proposal comes after one of the coldest Decembers on
record, a month in which heating oil prices shot up dramatically in
some parts of the country. In Massachusetts, for example, heating
oil costs surged from 88 cents per gallon a year ago to $1.41 per
gallon last week.
   The average participating household received $204 in heating
assistance last year, Simmons said. In most states, the money goes
directly to the local utility, which deducts it from the
household's bill.
   Program supporters say the benefits typically cover only about
20 percent of a low-income household's annual energy bill.
   The Jan. 29 date for submitting the budget is a week later than
the Jan. 22 deadline set by budget law, and budget chief Richard G.
Darman suggested Tuesday that late congressional action on fiscal
legislation last fall made it impossible to meet the dealine.
   The delay in the 1991 budget proposal also will push back Bush's
first State of the Union address from Jan. 25 to Jan. 30, according
to administration and congressional sources who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Administration sources said the budget for the 1991 fiscal year
starting Oct. 1 will call for $1.23 trillion in spending to meet a
$64 billion budget deficit target without proposing new taxes or
wholesale reductions in domestic programs.

   Sister Maureen Courtney, an American nun killed
in an attack on church workers in Nicaragua, was a teacher who
avoided the political strife that may have led to her death.
   ``She loved life and loved to share her life. I think it's just
a tragic loss of life. I just don't understand this kind of
tragedy,'' said Sister Jean Steffes, mother superior of Courtney's
order, the Sisters of St. Agnes in Fond du Lac, Wis.
   Courtney and another nun, Teresa Rosales of Nicaragua, were
killed Monday night in an attack on their car. The Nicaraguan
government on Tuesday blamed Contra rebels for the attack.
   Bishop Pablo Schmitz, 46, a native of Fond du Lac and an
auxiliary bishop in Bluefields, Nicaragua's main Caribbean port,
was injured, along with a Nicaraguan nun. Schmitz was shot in the
arm, church officials said.
   Steffes said today that latest church reports indicate the two
nuns were killed when their pickup drove over a grenade, which
exploded, and the truck was then ambushed by people who didn't seem
to realize they were church workers.
   ``As soon as the people in the jeep yelled, `We're religious!',
the shooting stopped,'' Steffes said. ``By then, Sister Maureen was
killed and sister Teresa DeJesus was also killed.''
   Steffes said residents of a tiny village near the scene of the
attack recovered the bodies and took the two injured people into
their homes. The villagers ``stayed up all night and prayed with
them,'' she said.
   ``I am deeply saddened by this attack and hope that the
perpetrators and their motives will become clearer,'' Milwaukee
Archbishop Rembert Weakland said.
   Courtney and the order's 20 other missionaries were not
politically motivated, Steffes said.
   ``They simply were there to be with the people,'' she said.
   A 45-year-old native of Milwaukee, Courtney worked for 15 years
in Central America, most recently teaching sewing and catechism at
a school in Port DeCasus, Nicaragua, and helping establish a
medical clinic, said Sister Mary Mollison of the Sisters of St.
Agnes.
   Before going to Nicaragua, she taught elementary school in
Beloit, Wis., and in Harlem, the order said.
   Church officials said Courtney's body would be flown to Fond du
Lac, about 55 miles northwest of Milwaukee, for burial.
   She decided not to fly home for Christmas, preferring to wait
until summer and a celebration of her 25th anniversary as a nun,
Steffes said.
   Courtney's parents, Frances and Russel Courtney of suburban
Milwaukee, were visited Tuesday by Steffes.
   ``She was supposed to celebrate her 25th jubilee in the order
this summer,'' said Mrs. Courtney, 79. ``She was just a lovely
little girl.''
   Mrs. Courtney said she worried about her daughter's safety but
never imagined she would be killed.
   ``Does anybody prepare for death?'' she said.
   Courtney visited her parents last year and could have been
assigned someplace other than Nicaragua, the family said.
   ``She understood what she was in for but she loved the type of
work she was in,'' said Norma Venkler, a classmate of Courtney's at
Divine Savior Holy Angels High School in Milwaukee in the 1960s.
``She chose to go back. She felt that was what she was called to
do.''
   Schmitz, the injured prelate, went to Nicaragua as a missionary
in 1972 and was ordained auxiliary bishop in 1984, said the Rev.
Larry La Cross, a spokesman for the Capuchin Order provincial
headquarters in Detroit.
   At a friary of the Order of Capuchin Franciscan Friars near Fond
du Lac, the Rev. Dan Crosby said the incident ``makes you think of
the situation that occurred just recently in El Salvador with the
six Jesuits being slain.''
   ``Somehow or other, one has to question all the American money
that is going into that region. Why is this happening? Why does it
continue?'' Crosby said.
   Steffes said a funeral for Courtney would be held Friday in Fond
du Lac.

   North America's movie theaters reaped a
record $5 billion-plus at the box office in 1989, powered by the
punch of ``Batman'' and other highly promoted action films.
   Despite a lackluster Christmas holiday season, summertime
moviegoers spun the turnstiles at such a dizzying pace that the
box-office record of $4.45 billion from 1988 was smashed, according
to figures released Tuesday.
   The box-office total, based on industry estimates, was set by
fewer films: 446 features made their debuts in 1989, down 13
percent from the previous year.
   In the studio-by-studio race, Warner Bros. was No. 1 with an
estimated 17.1 percent share of all U.S. and Canadian tickets sold.
   The studio's ``Batman'' was the year's biggest blockbuster. Its
$251.2 million in ticket sales was fifth-highest in history.
   Disney, which some analysts didn't expect to be competitive,
finished fifth with a healthy 13.8 percent share.
   Although part of the revenue surge is attributable to higher
ticket prices, admissions are projected to be greater than last
year.
   In large part, the record year was propelled by expensive and
heavily marketed star vehicles such as ``Batman,'' and ``Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade,'' which made $196 million and ``Lethal
Weapon 2,'' which collected $147 million, according to trade
publications and private research firms.
   Right behind, the lightly regarded ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids''
emerged as 1989's No. 4 film with receipts of $130 million. It was
followed by the 1988 holdover ``Rain Man'' $127 million.
   ``I think `Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' was a terrific surprise for
us,'' said David Hoberman, president of Walt Disney Pictures and
its Touchstone Pictures division. ``I think there is a market for
good, original films.''
   ``Both `Honey' and `Dead Poets Society' were out there competing
with a lot of sequels and enormous budget films and they competed
pretty nicely in that marketplace.''
   The rest of the year's top 10 were ``Ghostbusters II,'' $112
million; ``Look Who's Talking,'' $109 million; ``Parenthood,'' $95
million; Touchstone's ``Dead Poets Society,'' $94 million; and
``When Harry Met Sally ...,'' $91 million.
   Owing partly to cold weather and that Christmas fell on a
Monday, this year's holiday season was off from a year ago. The
scarce hits included ``Back to the Future Part II'' and ``National
Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.''
   The box-office figures only hint at the film industry's robust
health. Home video and cable television receipts now account for
about 57 percent of studio revenues, compared with about 30 percent
earned at movie houses, according to Paul Kagan Associates.
   Some analysts believe Hollywood's record year might mean studios
will produce and release fodder. ``Most of these movies never
should have been made,'' said A.D. Murphy, who follows box-office
revenues for Daily Variety.
   Of 1989's top five, only ``Rain Man,'' released first in 1988,
was widely praised by reviewers. And several critically acclaimed
films, such as ``Do the Right Thing,'' ``The Fabulous Baker Boys''
and ``Heathers'' _ did modest business.
   Among independent films, the top performers were ``sex, lies and
videotape'' with $24 million and ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous
Breakdown'' with more than $7 million.
   The year's biggest flops include ``Casualties of War,''
``Blaze,'' ``We're No Angels,'' ``Old Gringo,'' ``Fat Man and
Little Boy,'' ``Lock-Up,'' ``The Abyss,'' ``Young Einstein'' and
just about every movie from the Orion studios: ``She-Devil,''
``Valmont,'' ``Great Balls of Fire,'' ``Erik the Viking'' and
``Heart of Dixie.''
   A companion survey conducted by Orbit Video magazine of the
decade's biggest box-office stars revealed a mildly surprising name
as the era's most popular actor: Harrison Ford. Ford's movies,
according to the magazine's January survey, made $1.064 billion.
   Dan Aykroyd, owing much to the two ``Ghostbusters'' movies and a
brief appearance in ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,'' was
second with $871 million. Eddie Murphy was third with $828 million.
Bill Murray's work generated ticket sales of $696 million for
fourth place and Tom Cruise was fifth with $636 million.
   The top actress was Kim Basinger in 15th place overall with
combined sales of $432 million.

<HEAD>First Lady Begins Radiation Treatments for Eye Trouble</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top 3 grafs with Fitzwater post-treatment comment; picks up

   First lady Barbara Bush today began 10 days of
radiation treatment for eye swelling and impaired vision resulting
from a troublesome thyroid condition and said she felt fine
afterward, the White House said.
   Mrs. Bush went to Walter Reed Army Medical Center for the
10-minute treatment, which will be repeated on each of the next
nine days, said spokeswoman Jean Becker.
   ``She looks fine. She says she feels fine and her first
treatment has been completed,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters. He said he had seen Mrs. Bush this
morning as she was en route to visit President Bush in his office
following the treatment.
   The first lady suffers from Graves' disease, which has resulted
in a swelling behind her eyes, causing tearing and double vision.
The radiation, focused on bony canals behind the eyes called
orbits, is intended to reduce the swelling, Becker said. The
muscles that are swollen are in the orbit area.
   The radiation treatment will not prevent Mrs. Bush from carrying
out her normal schedule, the spokeswoman said.
   Mrs. Bush, 64, was diagnosed with Graves' disease last year and
was prescribed the drug prednisone to treat the eye side effect.
She also was given one dose of a radioactive liquid treatment to
treat the thyroid aspect of the disease. That treatment was
effective, but the eye side effect has remained, her office says.
   The prednisone has not improved her condition, although she is
still able to read and go about a normal schedule of activities.
   If the radiation is not successful, surgery would be an option.
   ``Step one was the drug she's been taking. That didn't work,''
Becker said. ``So this is the next step,'' she said of the
radiation.
   Graves' disease causes an overproduction of hormones, and
initially caused Mrs. Bush a dramatic weight loss over a period of
weeks. The radioactive treatment and use of the drug methimazole
halted the irregular hormone production by destroying the thyroid
gland.
   Mrs. Bush's press secretary, Anna Perez, said the first lady
will continue to take prednisone for a time, but at a reduced level
until she is completely off it.
   Perez said doctors decided to switch to radiation as an option
to the prospect of longterm use of prednisone, a steroid that has
side effects including water retention.
   ``They wanted to take her off the prednisone,'' Perez said.
``They just didn't want that longterm medication.''
   Mrs. Bush is under the care of White House physician Dr. Burton
Lee; Drs. Kenneth Burman and Frank LaPiana at Walter Reed; and Dr.
Robert Waller of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.

<HEAD>Kremlin Rushes Troops To Border With Iran</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 5 grafs to UPDATE with Tass report of one death;
Picks up 4th graf, `Izvestia, in ...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government rushed more border troops to the
southern republic of Azerbaijan today to try to stop a rampage by
thousands of people along the boundary with Iran, a newspaper
reported.
   One person was killed in a clash among the protesters, the
official news agency Tass reported today. Border guards did not use
their weapons and none were injured, it said. The report did not
say how many protesters were injured.
   The government daily Izvestia said more than 4,000 people tore
down guard towers and destroyed electronic alarms along the border.
   The rioters want southern Azerbaijan to be unified with northern
Iran and have threatened to remove all barriers at the border
unless authorities remove them, the newspaper reported.
Azerbaijanis have said they merely want the right to freely visit
friends and relatives on the other side of the border.
   Tass had said in the first report about the violence Tuesday
that the rioters were ``high on drugs or alcohol'' and didn't
mention political motives.
   Izvestia, in a report quoting I. Petrovas, head of the KGB's
Caucasus border district, mentioned only the political motives and
said protesters had been plotting the rampage for weeks.
   ``Practically along the entire border between Azerbaijan and
Iran a complex situation has emerged. This is about 490 miles on
land,'' Izvestia said.
   None of the reports mentioned any injuries or deaths, but
Izvestia said damage exceeds $8.2 million.
   The turmoil is the latest violence in the Caucasus, a region
torn for two years by strife among Azerbaijanis, Armenians,
Georgians and other ethnic groups. The sending of reinforcements
showed that the elite KGB guards stationed along the border were
incapable of ending the violence.
   The official news reports have not said how many border troop
reinforcements were being sent, or how many are already in the
region.
   Iran accused the Soviets of violating a border agreement,
Isvestia said.
   Vagiv Samedoglu, editor of the Azerbaijan People's Front
newspaper, called the Tass report of attacks by drunken,
narcotics-influenced mobs a ``lie'' written in Moscow, 1,200 miles
north of Nakhichevan.
   He said, however, that Soviet Azerbaijanis had been camped along
the border for nearly a month in hopes of seeing relatives and
friends on the other side. The Azerbaijanis are the only Soviet
ethnic group who, like Iranians, are largely Shiite Moslems.
   About 4 million ethnic Azerbaijanis live in the adjoining
Iranian province of Azerbaijan alone. Their Soviet kin want an open
border and the freedom to trade and cross the frontier, practices
that were suspended by dictator Josef Stalin, Samedoglu said by
telephone from Baku, Azerbaijan's capital.
   A rally was held Sunday in Baku to demand an open border, and
pickets renewed the call Tuesday in front of Azerbaijan's Interior
Ministry headquarters and Supreme Soviet legislature, Samedoglu
said.
   Soviets must submit to checks at the frontier and receive
permission to leave from KGB border troops.
   Iranian media monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus, had no immediate
report on the rampage. But Tass reported that Iranian border
commissioners issued a protest saying the ``actions by extremist
elements are insulting'' to Iran and requesting the Soviets act to
quell the disorders.
   Telephones rang unanswered Tuesday night at Azerbaijan's
official news agency, Azerinform, and attempts to obtain more
information were unsuccessful.
   Tass said ``irresponsible elements'' were trying to aggravate
tensions in Azerbaijan and the Caucasus as a whole and provoke a
brutal response from authorities. It did not elaborate.
   Like the Soviet Baltic republics, the Caucasus has seen the
emergence under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's more permissive rule of
popular grass roots movements that are demanding independence or
greater autonomy.
   The more liberal political atmosphere has also aggravated
long-simmering ethnic tensions, which have in the past year boiled
over into violence that has claimed dozens of lives and displaced
tens of thousands of people.
   Violence first was reported in Nakhichevan _ a 2,200-square-mile
Azerbaijani enclave sandwiched between Armenia and Iran _ in
November 1988, when Armenian media said gangs of Azerbaijanis had
ransacked Armenians' homes.
   Many ethnic Armenians then fled to the neighboring republic of
Armenia. There, they joined refugees from the Nagorno-Karabakh
enclave of Azerbaijan who felt threatened because of ethnic attacks
sparked by a continuing territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh.
   It was in Nagorno-Karabakh, which is predominantly Armenian,
that a crowd on Tuesday attacked a bus convoy carrying Azerbaijanis
with stones and firearms in the city of Stepanakert, Tass said.
   ``Cadets from the police school, for purposes of self-defense,
returned the fire,'' the agency reported, and one Stepanakert
resident was killed and three wounded.
   Armenians and Azerbaijanis have been fighting since February
1988 over claims to the enclave.

   A man fighting with his best friend over
whether he was too drunk to drive fell off a porch and died,
officials said.
   Thomas Horner, 45, of Syracuse, died Tuesday at Crouse Irving
Memorial Hospital, two days after he fell and struck his head on a
sidewalk, police said.
   Francis H. Murdent said he and Horner had been drinking Sunday
to celebrate New Year's Eve, according to police Sgt. Matt Kwiek.
Murdent said he believed Horner was too intoxicated to drive and
tried to stop him, Kwiek said.
   Murdent, 42, told police Horner swung at him and missed and that
he punched back, hitting his friend in the face.
   Horner stumbled over five steps to the sidewalk. Investigators
aren't sure whether Horner fell because of his alleged intoxication
or because of the punch, Kwiek said.
   No charges have been filed, but a grand jury may be asked to
review the case, police said.

   The center, announced in 1987, is to be open by summer 1991.
   More than 2 million visitors are expected during the first year
of operation.
   The project's non-profit sponsor, the Manned Space Flight

Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The provisional government today named
an executive committee apparently empowered with final say in
running the country. Another new political party criticized the
government's plans for elections in April.
   A soldier was seriously wounded by sniper fire overnight. The
attack was a reminder that holdouts from Nicolae Ceausescu's hated
secret police still pose a threat. Tanks and troops defending the
revolution remained in Bucharest's streets.
   The wounded soldier was admitted to Bucharest Emergency Hospital
with a bullet wound in the temple. Doctors described his condition
as ``very serious'' but released no details.
   Romania's army chief of staff, Col. Gen. Vasile Ionel, repeated
claims that 60,000 people died under Ceausescu's 24-year rule, and
he said 196 army officers and non-commissioned officers were killed
in the battle to oust him.
   He did not give a figure for non-officers, who bore the brunt of
the fighting that ended with Ceausescu's execution Christmas Day.
   ``Just how many died in the revolution will be found out later
on,'' he said.
   Western diplomats in Bucharest, citing witness accounts and
their own assessments, believe 10,000 people have died.
   A spokesman for the International Red Cross in Geneva,
Switzerland, said initial estimates, which at one point reached
60,000, were ``far too high.''
   Rompres, Romania's official news agency, said today the
governing National Salvation Front had created a new 11-member
executive committee with interim President Ion Iliescu as its chief.
   Romania also has a Cabinet, led by Premier Petre Roman, but the
ultimate authority has been the Front, which has legislative powers
and named the premier.
   According to Rompres, Dumitru Mazilu was named first deputy of
the executive committee. Mazilu was a leading critic of Ceausescu,
blasting the old regime in a report smuggled out of Romania this
fall and handed to the United Nations' Human Rights Commission in
Geneva, where Mazilu worked until being placed under house arrest
by Ceausescu in 1987.
   At least six political parties are known to have formed since
the uprising began Dec. 15, and the Front has planned free
elections in April.
   Nicolae Costel, a spokesman for one of the newly active parties
_ the Romanian Democratic Party _ said he thought April was too
soon for elections.
   The Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party has also
called for postponement of the elections to prevent the National
Salvation Front from having an unfair advantage.
   Costel said his party would be similar to Western Social
Democratic parties, ``since people in this country have become
allergic to the word `socialism.'''
   Costel said his party called for free elections in the second
half of the year, free trade unions and the right to strike, the
elimination of the Communist Party's leading role, continued
membership in the Warsaw Pact, possible membership in the European
Economic Community, and free travel for all Romanians.
   Romania's president should be elected every four years and be
limited to two terms in office, and the defense minister should be
a civilian, Costel said.
   Foreign Minister Sergiu Celac announced today that his West
German counterpart, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, will visit Romania in
the first half of this month, the Romanian news agency Rompres
reported.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze also is expected to
visit Bucharest within the first 10 days of January.
   Elsewhere in the East bloc today:
   _The interim government of East Germany's Communist premier,
Hans Modrow, tried to appease disgruntled opposition leaders by
promising to keep them better informed of national affairs and to
consult pro-democracy forces before making important decisions.
   _West Germany's Bild newspaper quoted President Manfred Gerlach
of East Germany as saying the Berlin Wall is ``superfluous'' and
will eventually be dismantled.
   _Bulgaria's Communist Party leaders opened talks with opposition
groups that could lead to formation of a transitional government
and the end of the Communists' guaranteed supremacy in Bulgaria.
   The entire former leadership of Romania was under arrest and
faced trial for abuses during their rule, the revolutionary
government announced Tuesday.
   ``I estimate there are about 60 ... all close colleagues of
Ceausescu,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Constantin Girbea told
reporters. He said ``all evildoers from the old regime will be
brought to justice.''
   Those arrested included members of the ruling Politburo,
although it was not clear if the entire body was being held. The
Politburo had 19 voting members and 26 non-voting members.
   Girbea promised that judgment would follow for ``all members of
the Ceausescu family.''
   The ousted dictator and his wife, Elena, were executed Christmas
after being convicted in a secret trial of grave crimes, including
genocide. The provisional government has since abolished the death
penalty.
   The Ceausescus' youngest son, Nicu, and only daughter, Zoia,
both were captured in the early days of the revolution. About 40
Ceausescu relatives are thought to have occupied ranking government
posts before the revolution. Ceausescu was one of nine children,
all of whom had families.

   Hundreds of black youngsters boycotted class
today over the school board's refusal to renew the contract of
Selma's first black superintendent.
   About a dozen pickets, including some children, appeared outside
Selma High School to encourage the boycott, and others protested at
several of the 10 other schools in the city, the site in 1965 of a
bloody civil rights clash.
   School Superintendent Norward Roussell, who implored students
not to boycott despite the decision Dec. 21 by the white-majority
school board, said about 25 percent of the system's 6,039 students
were absent. He said the system, which is nearly 70 percent black,
normally has a 10 percent absenteeism rate the first day after
winter break.
   The five blacks on the school board resigned after the six
whites declined to extend Roussell's contract beyond June. Some
community members have also protested by withdrawing thousands of
dollars from two banks with ties to school board members.
   ``This is not about me and it's not about the school system,''
Roussell said today. ``It's about what happened on the Pettus
Bridge 25 years ago.''
   Black voting rights marchers were clubbed and routed in clouds
of tear gas by mounted troopers in 1965 as they crossed the Edmund
Pettus Bridge. The bloodshed helped inspire passage by Congress of
the Voting Rights Act.
   Some of the boycotting students today were taken by parents or
demonstration leaders to a Baptist church, where a lawyer and
others spoke to them about civil rights history.
   Mayor Joe Smitherman said videotapes taken of students
participating in the boycott would be sent to school officials for
possible disciplinary action.
   Roussell, 55, became superintendent in 1987. The board cited a
job evaluation it would not make public in not renewing his
contract.
   Roussell then released the evaluation, which described him as
dictatorial and said his demanding of ``blind compliance'' led to a
lowering of teacher morale. Roussell disputed the findings and
called them unsubstantiated.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country.
   Jan. 2
   The Evening Sun, Baltimore, on the rise in Social Security rates:
   Speaking of reading lips, President Bush's promise of ``no new
taxes'' will become a cruel joke this week for 50 million-plus
American workers whose payroll tax for Social Security goes up
significantly on the first workday of the new year.
   The base salary on which the so-called FICA tax is levied goes
up from $48,000 to $51,300, and the rate itself goes up from 7.51
percent to 7.65 percent. The employer's share also goes up
commensurately, which means that money that might have been used
for higher pay must go to pay Social Security taxes.
   Bush is continuing the free ride, through deception, which
Ronald Reagan enjoyed throughout his administration by using Social
Security surpluses to disguise the truly devastating nature of the
growing federal debt.
   A fed-up Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan is saying to Bush, if you
really are opposed to new taxes, join me in repealing the increases
which go into effect Jan. 2.
   This is not going to happen, because if it did the whole house
of cards on which Reagan-Bush fiscal policy is based would come
crashing down. Moynihan's tactic does expose the hypocrisy of that
policy _ one that means raising the regressive tax against
middle-and even lower-income Americans while granting tax breaks to
the wealthy.
   By year's end a single worker earning $51,300 will pay $320
more, two-worker families will be hit even harder and even someone
earning $10,000 a year will pay an additional $14.
   Read Bush's lips. You will see he is lying.

   The Marion (Ohio) Star on trade with the Pacific Rim:
   The Bush administration, while not ignoring Europe, has been
wise to quietly join the Asian Pacific Economic Corp., a 12-nation
consortium of Pacific Rim nations organized to coordinate trade and
boost business in the region.
   A lot of attention has been paid to the impending union of
European nations in 1992. But U.S. trade with East Asia has tripled
since 1978 and currently, at $280 billion a year, runs 55 percent
above total American-European trade. Nations around the Pacific Rim
account for almost half the world's gross national product. ...
   The new consortium will help promote U.S. exports by dismantling
trade barriers and promoting investment. The United States, with
its growing Asian population, should be in an improved position by
virtue of its having joined the new consortium.

   The Philadelphia Inquirer on Romania and Panama:
   In one of those odd confluences of unrelated events, the dramas
in Panama and Romania have been playing themselves out in tandem.
For a time it even seemed possible that the two stories might
converge _ that the fleeing Ceausescus and the fleeing Noriega
would re-emerge simultaneously in a place like Cuba, which seems
anxious to carve out a niche as the last refuge of scoundrels.
   Over the holiday weekend, though, the stories took divergent
turns. The voodoo-worshiping Noriega turns himself in to the Pope's
man in Panama City on Christmas Eve. The atheist Ceausescus are
summarily tried and executed on Christmas Day. In both Panama and
Romania, the people on the streets are celebrating the vanquishing
of hated rulers and preparing for what they hope will be better and
calmer days ahead.
   What lessons might we draw during this pause in the action? In
the case of Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, it seems
transparent: Violence begets violence. Six Eastern European nations
rid themselves of orthodox communist leadership this year. Only in
Romania did the losing side resort to wide-scale bloodshed, and
only in Romania did the deposed rulers meet a bloody end. ...
   In Panama the revolution was born in the situation room of the
White House. Gen. Noriega was brought down by U.S. troops, pure and
simple. And yet Panamanians seem nearly as pleased and relieved as
the people of Romania. It's as if they wanted to do it themselves,
but they didn't know how. ...
   The ultimate success of the U.S. endeavor in Panama will not
depend on whether Noriega ends up in jail, on the gallows or in
comfortable exile. It will depend on whether the Panamanians take
advantage of this opportunity for renewal to build a better
society. Their new leaders share this advantage with Romania's
provisional government: Things could hardly get worse.

<HEAD>Parents Claim Fairy Tale Video Turned Out to be Porn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two youngsters got an eyeful of explicit
sex when a videotape labeled ``Cinderella'' turned out to be
hardcore porn, their parents say.
   Laura and David J. Burdick Sr. of Shelton filed suit in Superior
Court on Tuesday against New Toys R Us of Paramus, N.J., claiming
the mix-up traumatized their children.
   According to the lawsuit, the Burdicks bought the tape as a
Christmas present for the children in 1987, popped it into their
videocassette recorder and left the room. When they returned later,
they found the youngsters glued to ``Hollywood Confidential: Diary
of a Sex Goddess,'' the lawsuit said.
   The couple claim their children, then 7 and 8, suffered
emotional distress and loss of sleep and appetite.
   ``They were just old enough to grasp it but not sort it out,''
said Michael Moher, the Burdicks' attorney.
   The lawsuit claims Toys R Us was negligent in failing to inspect
the tape and in failing to protect children from exposure to
pornography.
   Angela Bourdon, a Toys R Us spokeswoman, said today she could
not comment on the lawsuit because the company had not yet received
a copy.
   The best-known ``Cinderella,'' the animated musical version of
the fairy tale made by the Walt Disney studio in 1950, was not
released on videotape until 1988, nearly a year after the alleged
incident.

   Los Angeles Daily News on Bush, China and Romania:
   In terms of their desire to be free, how are the Chinese any
different from Romanians? ... (I)t's wrong to assume that China
can't topple its dictators as Romania has just done. If President
Bush could grasp that point, he would understand what a mistake it
is for him to be cozying up to Beijing's Communists.
   By every indication, China's tyrants are running scared.
Communist leaders are understandably concerned about comparisons
being drawn between the Romanian revolt and the pro-democracy
protests in Tiananmen Square in June. ...
   In both cases, for example, the demonstrations gained a momentum
that could only be possible in countries where the people are
enormously deprived and discontented. ... And Chinese Premier Li
Peng last week ordered the People's Armed Police to guard against
any renewal of pro-democracy protests inspired by Romania's
example. ...
   Last week, Li told a meeting of the State Council, China's
cabinet, that ``despite the changes in the international situation,
China will maintain a firm belief in itself (and) adhere to the
socialist direction.''
   Whether or not Li believes his own rhetoric, there's no reason
for Bush to swallow even a single word of it. Unfortunately, the
president continues to defiantly defend his overtures to Beijing as
the right thing to do under the circumstances. But, as the events
in Romania have shown most convincingly, circumstances have a way
of changing overnight.

   Seattle Times on China:
   The 1990s look ominous for the world's diehard dictators.
   Take China, where Communist party leaders who ordered the brutal
crackdown in Tiananmen Square last summer were clearly shaken by
what happened to Romania's hard-line leader, Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The Chinese government had long maintained close ties with
Ceausescu, pledging military unity and revolutionary friendship
with him even as communism collapsed in the rest of Eastern Europe.
   Now, according to a Western diplomat in Beijing, ``The
leadership is twitching with fear.''
   Their bunker mentality was revealed in a recent internal
memorandum that reportedly told officials what to think and say
about Romania _ i.e., to remain internationally neutral but
domestically critical.

   San Antonio Express-News on the Soviet Union and the Baltics:
   Mikhail Gorbachev enters the 1990s on a tightrope, poised
between mutually exclusive goals. His acrobatic prowess is about to
be tested yet again _ perhaps decisively _ in the Baltics.
   Gorbachev wants communism without having to impose it by force.
But as soon as they are given a choice, large numbers of his people
express their contempt for communism. Nowhere is this more evident
than in the Baltic states _ Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania _ which
were independent between the world wars, before the Red Army
occupied them. ...
   As dissident Andrei Sakharov warned, there is no stable solution
short of self-determination by the Soviet people, and Gorbachev is
bold enough to carry it out if he wants to.
   But if he tries to use force in the Baltics, he will suffer from
Western censure and isolation. The United States must leave no
doubt that it recognizes the Baltic peoples' right to sovereign
self-rule.

   Daily News, Starkville, Miss., on Cuba:
   The demise of communism around the world is sending a strong
signal that cannot be denied by Cuba. Fidel Castro must surely know
his days in power are numbered.
   The fall of Romanian strongman Nicolae Ceausescu should send
cold chills up the back of Castro who stays in power on the back of
a military force.
   The people of the world are crying out for more freedom. They
want economic and social freedom. They want a voice in determining
the government under which they live.
   Modern technology has torn down the Iron Curtain. Satellite
transmission of news, the Voice of America broadcasts and
international travel to and from communist countries have told a
story to Warsaw Pact nations that life can be better.
   Such is the case in Castro's Cuba. The day of censorship is
over. This information will be the downfall of Castro.
   There can be no timetable for those events, because as long as
Castro can make the people of Cuba believe evil things about
Americans his case is strong vigilance against capitalism.
   Communism has survived because the leaders were able to preach
the fear of foreigners to those without other sources of
information.
   That day has come and gone and so will those who rule that way.

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma's military rulers have lifted a
martial law order in 10 northwestern townships, official Rangoon
Radio reported.
   ``Since the law and order security conditions have improved in
the jurisdiction of the northwest military command, martial law is
hearby revoked,'' the radio said Tuesday, quoting from a
proclamation signed by the military intelligence chief, Brig. Gen.
Khin Nyunt.
   A text of the broadcast was seen Wednesday in Bangkok.
   Revoked was the martial law order the authorities declared July
18 as they clamped down on pro-democracy activists.
   Technically, the entire country remains under martial law since
leader Gen. Saw Maung retains legislative, judicial and
administrative power. He came to power in a September 1988 coup
after which his soldiers killed hundreds of people demonstrating
for democracy.
   The order had extended the central martial law powers to the
commanders of three military regions: Rangoon, the central and
northwestern parts of the country. It covered crimes deemed
threatening to national security.
   The order was lifted earlier in four other townships in the same
military command area. It remains in force in 14 townships there.

<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former East German leader Erich
Honecker may be moved to a monastery to protect him from a possible
lynching by enraged citizens, a newspaper said Wednesday.
   In a front-page story, the mass-circulation Bild newspaper said
``Lynch Danger _ Church Wants to Grant Honecker Asylum.''
   Since Honecker was ousted Oct. 18, the former Communist Party
leader and other party officials have come under investigation for
charges of corruption and living in luxury at the cost of the state.
   In December, seven former Politburo members were arrested, and
Honecker was placed under house arrest in the government housing
area of Wandlitz outside East Berlin.
   The Wandlitz homes, including the one in which Honecker still
lives, are being converted to a medical rehabilitation center for
children. Honecker is expected to be forced out of the compound in
February.
   Bild said it had information that ``Lutheran and Catholic church
sources have offered Honecker _ who is threated by public rage _
protection and refuge.''
   ``This is the only possibility to protect Erich Honecker from
the rage of the East German people,'' Bild quoted the source as
saying.
   It was the churches that became the venues for gathering of
pro-democracy groups that eventually brought the overthrow of his
18-year leadership.
   In recent weeks, East German groups have called for punishing
Honecker and for moving him to smaller quarters ``with an outside
toilet,'' Bild said.
   The current leadership fears that in such a situation, Honecker
``might be attacked and become a victim of lynch justice,'' Bild
said.
   Honecker, 77, underwent gall-bladder surgery in August, and East
German media reported he remains seriously ill.
   ``Sources say the ailing ex-leader may be placed in a
church-operated home for the elderly, or even in a monastery,''
Bild reported.

<HEAD>Laos Says 1989 Was a `Nightmare' For Socialism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   1989 was ``a nightmare year for
socialism'' but the ideology will prevail and citizens should rally
around the Communist Party leadership, official Laotian radio said.
   In an apparent reference to the upheaval in Eastern Europe, the
New Year's broadcast said capitalist countries had seized upon the
difficulties in the socialist countries to try to dismantle the
socialist system through ``ideological and political war.''
   ``In brief, 1989 was a nightmare year for socialism. Of course,
all our people have been concerned with these developments,'' said
the broadcast, a text of which was seen in Bangkok Wednesday.
   ``Nonetheless, the Lao people will never lose their faith in the
socialist countries, nor in their capabilities in finding a way out
to overcome all difficulties,'' it said.
   As socialism came under attack, ``in 1990 it is necessary that
we strengthen and consolidate the national unity and unification
under the banner of the party leadership,'' the broadcast said.
   Laos also must continue its reforms, strengthen its relations
with Communist allies Vietnam, Cambodia and the Soviet Union, and
pay attention to internal security, it said.
   The Communist Party seized power in Laos in December 1975,
toppling a coalition government and abolishing the monarchy. The
country is one of the world's poorest and has very limited
diplomatic and trade contacts outside the Communist bloc.
   Vietnam's Communist Party also has resisted reforms. Party chief
Nguyen Van Linh said Monday that building socialism will be his
nation's goal in 1990.

   Chicago Tribune on Czechoslovakia:
   In 1620, a Czech revolt against their Austrian Hapsburg rulers
touched off the Thirty Years' War, a series of conflicts that swept
through Europe. Alexander Dubcek's daring but peaceful revolt in
1968 against the worst constrictions of Soviet-style communism
didn't have such a directly traceable long-term effect. But the
time memorialized by freedom lovers as the Prague Spring left an
enduring legacy. ...
   After 21 years of political exile as a virtual non-person,
Dubcek, now 68 and widely revered for his earlier efforts at
liberalization, has been restored to power. He was unanimously
elected last week as the interim chairman of the Czech parliament.
...
   With their sad and ancient tradition of bad political news
invariably followed by worse, last week's events were cause for
about as much national joy as the Czechs and Slovaks ever dared
indulge in. With the political rebirth of Dubcek and the election
as temporary president of the popular Vaclav Havel _ the courageous
playwright who has led the noncommunist opposition _ the fires of
freedom are burning bright.
   And this time, as they enter a new year they once only dreamed
of, Czechoslovakians seem determined to keep the precious flames
alive.

   Statesman-Journal, Salem, Ore., on the Alaskan oil spill:
   The lasting effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, now more than
9 months old, have sobering consequences for those who might have
wished that the cleanup were over.
   Alaskan fishery authorities have continued to shut down
commercial fisheries in the Prince William Sound because of renewed
sightings of oil slicks. They say the slicks would contaminate
catches and fishing gear.
   The latest fishery to be affected is the winter shrimp trawling
season, closed (in December). It normally would run through the
winter but now will not reopen before Feb. 28.
   The brown king crab fishery was canceled for the year. Other
fisheries affected include salmon and herring.
   Most commercial fisheries in the area have been closed since the
spill.
   Authorities say the oil apparently is bleeding into the sound
from surrounding beaches. ...
   The lesson that we keep being reminded of is that the ability of
oil companies to deal with such large oil spills remains woefully
inadequate.

   The Durham (N.C.) Sun on Billy Martin:
   News of Billy Martin's death in a one-vehicle traffic accident
caused shock throughout professional baseball, just as his
off-the-field actions did many times during his 13 years as a
manager.
   Few experts questioned Martin's managerial skills, first
nurtured while he played for Casey Stengel on five World
Championship teams with the New York Yankees.
   Martin was a true Yankee, managing the team for controversial
owner George Steinbrenner five times. He also managed the Minnesota
Twins, Detroit Tigers, Texas Rangers and Oakland Athletics.
   Even though he often made the right moves from the dugout,
Martin's drinking and feisty nature cost him some jobs as manager.
His well-publicized barroom brawls did, however, land him a
starring role in a beer commercial.
   Although he was reaching the age, 61, when many people think
about retirement, Billy Martin still was occasionally mentioned
when major league teams were looking for new managers.
   Billy Martin certainly will be missed in baseball. It is
unfortunate, however, that he too often will be remembered for his
off-the-field trouble instead of his good decisions as a manager
and his true love of the game.

<HEAD>Toll in Northern Ireland Last Year: 62 Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Political and sectarian
violence claimed 62 lives in Northern Ireland in 1989, bringing the
20-year toll to 2,774, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said Wednesday.
   Of those killed last year, 39 were civilians, nine were members
of the constabulary, 12 were with the British army and two were
members of the army's locally recruited Ulster Defense Regiment.
   Security officials had predicted increased violence in 1989, the
20th anniversary of what Northern Ireland calls ``the troubles,''
but it was the third lowest death toll for any year since 1970.
   In 1988, 93 people died in Northern Ireland violence, 54 of them
civilians.
   Not included in the police figures are the four people killed by
the Irish Republican Army on the Continent last year and the 11
Royal Marines bandsmen killed in an IRA bombing on their barracks
in mainland Britain in September.
   The IRA is fighting British rule over Northern Ireland. It wants
to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman
Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.

<TEXT>
   Peru, which pulled out as a participant in an
upcoming drug summit in Colombia to protest the U.S. invasion of
Panama, has reversed course and will attend the conference,
American and Peruvian officials said today.
   Peru had withdrawn from the Feb. 15 meeting where President Bush
and the presidents of the three Andean nations _ Peru, Colombia and
Bolivia _ were to discuss cooperation in the fight against drug
production and trafficking.
   It said it was doing so to protest President Bush's Dec. 20
invasion of Panama with 14,000 troops to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega from power.
   U.S. officials said subsequently they had indications Peru would
change its mind on that decision.
   ``Peru indicates they intend to participate,'' presidential
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters today, although the
word came through media rather than diplomatic channels.
   Fitzwater said, however, he did not know if Peru's president,
Alan Garcia, would attend, or whether he would send a lower-ranking
representative. The meeting was designed as a meeting of the four
presidents.
   A Peruvian diplomat in Washington confirmed that Peru had
reversed itself but said it was not yet firm who would represent
the South American nation.
   The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said current
plans are for a minister of foreign relations or minister of
interior to attend.
   If the United States withdraws its invasion troops from Panama,
Garcia may go, the diplomat said.
   The Peruvian official said Lima had reacted hastily in
withdrawing its participation out of anger over the Panama
situation, which has earned Bush criticism from many nations.
   ``In no way did Peru want to boycott the meeting,'' the official
said. ``Sometimes you say things, and then you realize it wasn't
the proper thing to say.''
   Peru is the world's major producer of coca leaf, while Colombia
is the leader in processing and exporting the plant for cocaine.
   A U.S. government team will travel to Bolivia this month to meet
with officials from the Andean countries and work on agreement
language for the summit, officials said.

<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered the city of New
Haven to provide shelter to all homeless people who request it,
saying Connecticut cities have a legal obligation to do so that
dates back three centuries.
   Superior Court Judge Anthony DeMayo said courts in several other
states, including New York, New Jersey and California, have issued
similar right-to-shelter rulings.
   ``Connecticut belongs in the ranks of those humane and
progressive states which place human need ahead of budgetary
concerns,'' he wrote in an opinion issued last week.
   An attorney for the city of New Haven, which was the target of a
lawsuit that led to the decision, said Tuesday the city will appeal.
   Deputy Corporation Counsel Edward Mattison said no other
right-to-shelter order has been as far-reaching and argued the
ruling would hurt the city's efforts to provide a long-term
solution to the homeless problem.
   In his ruling, DeMayo cited a summary of colonial laws compiled
in 1672 stating that ``every town within this colony shall maintain
their own poor.''
   Earlier, DeMayo had required New Haven to open a new 50-bed
shelter to provide emergency housing for people unable to find
space at the city's other shelters. That order raises the number of
available beds to 225.
   The city Tuesday said no one is being turned away now but that
more space is likely to be needed later in the winter.
   The state Department of Human Resources estimates that there
3,000 to 5,000 homeless in the state. Columbus House, New Haven's
main homeless shelter, said 1,200 different people stayed one or
more nights there during the last year.
   The ruling provides homeless people and their advocates ``good
ammunition'' to get other Connecticut municipalities to establish
or expand shelters, said Amy Eppler-Epstein, an attorney for New
Haven Legal Assistance.
   DeMayo gave the city of 125,000 people 30 days to come up with a
plan for implementing his order but left open the possibility he
may narrow the scope of the injunction. He said the city's plan
could include charging some homeless people for shelter and
limiting eligibility.

   Three teen-age boys raped and tortured an

   A 16-year-old was arrested, and police were seeking two other

   The victim had gone Tuesday to visit a playmate who was not at

boys who were friends of her playmate's brother, Vreeland said.
   The teen-agers raped and sodomized the girl, used a hot knife to
burn her breasts, and stabbed their victim on the leg with a hot
ice pick, police said.
   The teen-agers put a gun to the girl's head and took her to the
roof of the building in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of
Manhattan, where they dangled her over the edge.
   The teen-agers took their victim to her grandmother's house and
the grandmother called police, Vreeland said. The girl was taken to
St. Luke's Hospital.

   The Bush administration today deplored the
killing of two nuns in Nicaragua but said the leftist government in
Managua has failed to back up its charge that the attack was
carried out by the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it was not known who
carried out the ambush Monday night on a car carrying the Roman
Catholic church workers on a highway in a remote northern section
of the country.
   Two nuns _ one American, the other Nicaraguan _ were killed, and
a third was injured, as was an American-born Nicaraguan bishop.
   ``We deplore in the strongest terms this outrageous attack on
religious workers and extend our deepest sympathy to the families
of the victims. This is a tragic incident, one that further
underscores the need to bring peace, stability and democracy to
Nicaragua,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   ``The U.S. Embassy in Nicaragua has been in contact with local
church officials to obtain information, including the Sisters of
Saint Agnes and the Capuchin Fathers,'' he said.
   ``We have no information on who was reponsible for this attack,
and we note that the church officials themselves have no
information, either,'' Fitzwater continued.
   ``The Nicaraguan government has provided no information to
substantiate its charge that the Contras launched the attack, and
we hope the Sandinistas do not seek to obscure this tragedy by
engaging in a propaganda battle.''
   Fitzwater said the Contras had condemned the attack and its
military commander said the attack occurred outside of the Contras'
usual operating area.
   Six Jesuit priests were slain in El Salvador recently a few days
after leftist rebels launched an offensive against the government
of Alberto Cristiani. Church groups have charged government
security forces may have carried out those killings.
   The Nicaraguan government recently broke off a cease-fire with
the rebels. Elections are scheduled in the country next month, the
first since the Sandinistas toppled right-wing dictator Anastasio
Samoza and came to power in 1979.

   The new government closed TV and
radio stations linked to Manuel Antonio Noriega, and the Vatican
said today that Noriega was being held in ``strict isolation'' in a
room with a broken television set.
   The Bush administration said it would not rule out a
third-country destination for Noriega, although it prefers trying
him in the United States.
   A top U.S. delegation led by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger met with President Guillermo Endara and other leaders
of Panama's new government to begin planning American help for
economic recovery.
   The U.S. Embassy said Eagleburger would look at ways to help
Panama recover from its economic decline, which began largely when
the United States imposed sanctions in its effort to drive Noriega
from power.
   Panama's economy was further battered by fighting during the
American invasion and massive looting that followed.
   Acting Treasury Secretary John Robson and Mark Edelman, acting
director of the U.S. Agency for International Development,
accompanied Eagleburger.
   The embassy said the delegation also planned visits to a
displaced persons camp, the Panama Canal and to businesses trashed
in the looting that followed the Dec. 20 invasion.
   The U.S Southern Command said today a cache of about 80,000
pounds of plastic explosives was found near the port city of Colon,
50 miles northwest of Panama City, on the Atlantic end of the
Panama Canal.
   The Southern Command, responsible for U.S. military operations
in Central and South America, gave no further details on the find.
   Noriega remained inside the Vatican mission, where he sought
refuge on Christmas Eve to escape capture.
   No one was allowed to talk to Noriega, on the orders of Papal
Nuncio Jose Sebastian Laboa, according to Vatican Embassy deputy
spokesman Jose Cubillas, who added that the general's room
contained a broken television.
   Cubillas said Noriega and two aides in the embassy with him are
``very nervous.''
   In Washington today, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
denied that the Bush administration was moving away from its
position that Noriega should be brought to the United States to
face drug-trafficking charges.
   ``I want to make clear from this podium our positon is we want
him returned to the United Staes,'' Fitzwater told reporters at his
daily briefing. But, he added, ``we will not rule out any and every
other kind of option.''
   On Saturday, Bush suggested that allowing Noriega to go to a
third country where he could be free from prosecution was no longer
an acceptable option. The United States had proposed, as recently
as October, a variety of deals that would have allowed Noriega to
step down and go to a third country.
   Today's comments suggested that option was once again being
considered.
   Endara's government on Tuesday closed two television stations
and 10 radio stations and declared them under ``state custody.''
   Government spokesman Edwin Cabrera said the stations would be
returned to their owners if their finances were in order.
   One of the TV stations was owned by Carlos Duque, who was
Noriega's presidential candidate in May 7 elections that Noriega
annulled when international observers said Endara was ahead by a
3-1 margin.
   ``We don't intend to turn these mediums into propaganda machines
while they are under investigation,'' Cabrera said.
   He said the government also returned to its owners three
newspaper shut down by Noriega. Noriega's government had seized
Critica, Matutino and Le Republica and ran them for its own
purposes.
   Ramon de Lima, the government's vice minister, said the
country's press laws would be reviewed by the legislative assembly
because they were ``instruments of oppression'' under Noriega.
   President Bush on Tuesday named career diplomat Deane Hinton as
ambassador to Panama. Hinton is now ambassador to Costa Rica and
will replace Ambassador Arthur H. Davis, a Reagan administration
appointee who was recalled May 11 to protest Noriega's thwarting of
free elections.
   A top Vatican envoy, Monsignor Giacinto Berloco, arrived Tuesday
to help in the negotiations surrounding Noriega's fate.
   The Vatican said Berloco would ``give a hand'' to papal nuncio
Sebastian Laboa, who heads the embassy. Berloco was not seen
Tuesday and the Vatican gave no further details.
   The Vatican has said it is trying to persuade Noriega to leave
the mission by himself. But it has repeatedly said it would not
hand him over to U.S. troops.
   On Tuesday afternoon, a man in a white suit emerged from the
Vatican mission and was hustled away by U.S. troops encircling the
two-story compond. U.S. Embassy spokesmen said they had no
explanation.
   Cubillas, the Vatican spokesman, identified the man as Juan
Carlos Cabrera, a Cuban who had been living in the burned-out El
Chorrillo section of Panama City. He said the man became nervous
because he had no identification documents and sought refuge in the
Vatican Embassy.
   ``They have investigated him, and there are no charges against
him and he is now free,'' Cubillas said.

<HEAD>Quayle Gets Higher Grades from Conservatives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservatives give President Bush grades
ranging from ``B'' to ``D'' but rate Vice President Dan Quayle an
``A'' or ``A minus'' in a critique of the first year of the Bush
administration.
   John Sununu also gets generally top grades, with some calling
him the best White House chief of staff in many years, and
Secretary of State Dick Cheney has marks ranging from ``A minus''
to ``C plus.''
   However, Secretary of State James A. Baker III had grades
ranging from ``C'' to ``D minus.'' Paul Weyrich, director of the
Free Congress Foundation, called Baker ``the greatest
disappointment of the Bush administration.''
   Five conservative leaders responded to questions posed by Policy
Review, a magazine published by the conservative Heritage
Foundation. The survey results will be published in the magazine's
winter issue, due out this month.
   The magazine said a large number of conservative leaders were
approached in November, but most were unwilling then to offer
first-year assessments.
   The five who did respond later were asked if they would give
extra credit to Bush or Baker for the intervention in Panama. All
gave the maximum two stars to Bush, except Edward H. Crane,
president of the Libertarian Cato Institute, who gave none.
   All gave Baker two stars as well except for Crane, who again
gave none, and Weyrich, who awarded one.
   ``George Bush is not sure why he wants to be president,'' said
Amy Moritz, executive director of the National Center for Public
Policy Research. She gave Bush a ``C minus.''
   Weyrich, Burton Yale Pines, senior vice president and director
of research at the Heritage Foundation, and Pat Robertson, chief
executive officer of the Christian Broadcasting Network and an
unsuccessful candidate for the 1988 GOP presidential nomination,
handed out ``Bs'' to the president.
   ``He did not take office to make a revolution, and he hasn't,''
Pines said, while Robertson called Bush ``exactly the kind of
president I expected him to be: steady, competent, unimaginative.''
   Crane gave Bush the lowest grade, a ``D,'' saying ``his
continued popularity among conservatives is a sad commentary on
what's left of the Reagan revolution.''
   Crane did not rate Quayle, but both Moritz and Robertson gave
the vice president an ``A.''
   Robertson called Quayle ``a superb vice president,'' while
Pines, who gave him an ``A minus,'' called his performance ``well
above expectations.'' Weyrich gave him the same grade for being ``a
very effective advocate of conservative positions.''
   Weyrich gave the only ``A plus'' _ to Sununu, whom he called the
``best chief of staff I have seen'' in 23 years in Washington.
   Sununu got an ``A'' from Robertson and ``A minus'' from both
Moritz and Pines. Crane, however, gave him a ``D,'' saying he is
``a competent manager, but has failed to mold a weak presidency
into anything approaching a coherent program.''
   Crane gave Baker a ``C,'' arguing that the State Department
``should have a conceptual thinker, not merely an accomplished
political technocrat.'' Moritz gave the secretary of state a ``D
minus,'' saying he ``likes to hold his cards close to his chest''
and ``from this distance ... they appear blank.''
   Pines gave Baker a ``B minus,'' calling him ``pathetic on
Central America'' but ``solid on China.'' Robertson, however, said
``Baker's response to the massacre in Tiananmen Square was nothing
short of disgraceful'' and handed him a ``C minus.'' Weyrich gave
him a ``D.''
   Pines and Robertson gave Cheney an ``A minus,'' with Robertson
calling him ``one of the shining stars in the Bush cabinet.''
Weyrich rated him a ``B,'' saying he ``started out with a bang but
he has not proven to be as effective an advocate for crucial
defense decisions ... as he was thought to be when appointed.''
Crane gave him a ``C plus.''

   Government delegates to talks with the
opposition said Wednesday that drastic action is necessary to
rescue the East German economy, which labors under a huge debt and
severe shortage of skilled workers.
   One opposition group threatened to quit the weekly negotiations.
   The administration of Communist Premier Hans Modrow has
recommended price increases for energy and removal of subsidies on
food and other basic goods, but rejects following Poland in a
radical turn toward market principles.
   Tensions have increased in recent weeks between Modrow's interim
government and a fractious array of new political parties and
reform groups as they try to reshape East Germany and prepare for
democratic elections in May.
   Opposition groups have accused Modrow's government of keeping
important decisions secret during what they see as a transitional
period.
   Forty years of Communist mismanagement and the emigration to
West Germany last year of hundreds of thousands of skilled workers
are being felt in a shortage of goods and decline in services.
   Labor shortages in health and other public services mean
understaffed hospitals and littered streets. The decline in
industrial production that began last year is expected to continue
through spring.
   An opposition groups that seeks clarification of some issues
threatened on Wednesday to leave the weekly talks in which
representatives of about 20 political parties and citizen groups
are working on reforms.
   Democratic Awakening, a political group advocating closer ties
with the West and a more market-oriented economy, has demanded to
know whether East Germany still has a national security force and,
if so, whether it is armed.
   The government said last month the secret police agency was
being disbanded. On Wednesday, Democratic Awakening leader Wolfgang
Schnur demanded ``evidence'' of that by Monday.
   New Forum, the largest reform movement with 200,000 members, had
threatened earlier to pull out of the weekly negotiations.
   At Wednesday's session, Economics Minister Christa Luft gave a
grim account of East Germany's condition.
   More than 250,000 job remain unfilled, she said, and the
situation is particularly acute in health services, education,
public works and factories.
   In 1989, more than 320,000 East Germans fled to the freedom and
greater prosperity of West Germany, where East Germans are given
generous aid and have little trouble integrating.
   Departures tapered off at the end of the year, after the
government ended travel restrictions Nov. 9 and embarked on a
reform program. but some officials fear renewed emigration if
living conditions do not improve.
   Ms. Luft called for more private enterprise to meet the public
demand for s restaurants, electronics repair and other consumer
services.
   ``In the interest of economic effectiveness, we must develop a
proprietary consciousness and behavior in our population,'' she
said.
   She said a law protecting the interests of foreign investors
would be written to encourage more cooperation between West German
and East German companies, ``but I cannot imagine an investment
cooperation policy on Western terms.''
   Invoking a central principle of Communist ideology, she rejected
the concept of unemployment in East Germany.
   The nation's foreign debt stands at $20.6 billion, she said,
greater per capita than that of Poland. West German economists say,
however, that East Germany's economic condition is much better than
that of Poland or Hungary, two other Soviet bloc nations pursuing
reform.
   In her argument to the negotiating group, Ms. Luft exhorted
workers to produce more for export and avoid buying imported goods.
   Much of the foreign debt has resulted from imports of grain,
consumer goods and raw materials, rather than for high-technology
equipment that could help rejuvenate industry, she said.
   Wolfgang Gress, head of the government planning commission, said
higher prices for energy would encourage changes needed to reduce
the burning of brown coal, the major source of the pollution in
East German cities.
   He said 5 percent less coal would be made available in the first
three months of this year.
   Such detailed reports on the economy as that given Wednesday by
Ms. Luft were offered after New Forum threatened to leave the
talks. New party chief Gregor Gysi and his No. 2 man, Mayor
Wolfgang Berghofer of Dresden, represent the Communists in the
negotiations.

   A U.S. magistrate refused bond
Wednesday to a long-sought Bolivian colonel who allegedly once
vowed to cover Americans in cocaine.
   An innocent plea and request for a jury trial were entered for
Luis Arce Gomez, dubbed Bolivia's ``Minister of Cocaine,'' on 1983
charges of conspiracy to import and conspiracy to distribute
cocaine.
   Magistrate Lurana Snow found probable cause that Arce Gomez,
seized by Bolivian authorities and turned over to the United States
on Dec. 10, was a danger to the community and a risk to flee.
   The magistrate noted that the U.S. government had been actively
seeking Arce Gomez's extradition since 1983.
   Attorneys disclosed that a Colombian co-defendant has pleaded
guilty to one of the two counts of cocaine conspiracy. Ana
Rodriguez de Tamayo, who was extradited last October, pleaded
guilty Tuesday. A second conspiracy count was dropped, but Michael
Patrick Sullivan, an assistant U.S. attorney, refused to discuss
the plea or whether she will testify against Arce Gomez.
   The magistrate set a Feb. 14 status conference.
   Arce Gomez, who is being held at the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center, listened to the proceedings through an
interpreter.
   Prosecutors didn't present witnesses, but cited four affidavits
used in earlier efforts to extradite Arce Gomez.
   An affidavit from John Patrick Raftery, a Drug Enforcement
Administration special agent, said Arce Gomez was involved in
conspiracy to import hundreds of pounds of cocaine into the United
States. As Bolivia's Minister of Interior from July 1980 to March
1981, the affidavit said, Arce Gomez directed operations in which
he collected protection money from cocaine traffickers.
   A special security service he formed ``would seize cocaine from
traffickers who were not paying for protection and deliver it to
traffickers who were paying for protection,'' the affidavit said.
   On one shipment of 374 pounds of cocaine, Arce Gomez charged
$1.3 million, the affidavit said.
   Two admitted participants in cocaine trafficking, Bolivian
citizens Enrique Atala Zabala and Sonia Sanjanez de Atala, said
Arce Gomez told them he was involved in cocaine trafficking because
the government was in a difficult economic situation. Arce Gomez
blamed the United States for cutting off aid.
   ``(Arce Gomez) stated that because the gringos liked cocaine,
the gringos ought to take care of their borders because he was
going to cover them in cocaine,'' Atala Zabala said in his
affidavit.
   U.S. officials, led by President Bush, hailed Bolivia's decision
to allow Arce Gomez to be prosecuted in the United States, although
some Bolivian politicians were critical of his extradition.
   If convicted, he faces up to 30 years in U.S. prison.
   Arce Gomez was one of 18 people named in the April 1983
indictment. Three of the people pleaded guilty and two others were
convicted. Eleven are still fugitives.

   Nearly one-fourth of the Justice Department's
organized crime prosecutors have quit since Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh announced plans to put their extraordinarily successful
strike forces under the control of local U.S. attorneys.
   After a year of controversy and discontent in Congress,
Thornburgh on Monday imposed the change he has been seeking for 15
years.
   Veterans of the Justice Department's two-decade, all-out attack
on La Cosa Nostra predict that even more of their colleagues will
quit now that hopes of blocking the move have been dashed. So far,
33 have left.
   ``People are voting with their feet,'' said Jeremiah O'Sullivan,
who headed the Boston strike force for 10 years and left for
private practice this year after serving briefly as U.S. attorney
there. ``There will be a larger turnover immediately after the
merger, especially of the key, experienced people.''
   Since 1980, the strike forces have convicted mob leaders long
thought untouchable in Boston, Brooklyn, Cleveland, Chicago,
Denver, Kansas City, Los Angeles, New Haven, Conn., New Orleans,
Philadelphia and Rochester, N.Y.
   Until now, they reported directly to the Organized Crime and
Racketeering Section of the department's Criminal Division in
Washington. One-hundred fifteen career government prosecutors in
the strike forces now will become assistants to the U.S. attorneys,
who are political appointees of the president. Twenty more based in
Washington would handle emergency assignments.
   Thornburgh predicts ``substantial management benefits'' because
there will no longer be two separate federal prosecutors in the
same jurisdiction.
   He also says the move is needed because the strike forces have
been slow to respond to new organized crime elements such as the
Colombian drug cartels, Asian groups, street gangs such as the
Crips and Bloods, and the Jamaican posses.
   Thornburgh first proposed such a merger in 1974. At the time, as
U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh, he was battling with his local strike
force chief and headed a committee of U.S. attorneys who studied
the issue.
   In acting Monday, Thornburgh spurned a last-minute appeal by
Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph R. Biden to hold up the
reorganization.
   Many strike force veterans dispute the attorney general's claim
of increased efficiency.
   Peter Vaira, who headed strike forces in Chicago and
Philadelphia and was U.S. attorney in Philadelphia for five years,
predicts they will have ``atrophied'' within three years as U.S.
attorneys pursue only short-term, fast-result cases.
   Few of the 93 U.S. attorneys stay more than four years in the
job; many leave to pursue their own political careers.
   ``It has sometimes taken decades to bring about the remarkable
successes that have been accomplished; a U.S. attorney cannot wait
for even two or three years for results,'' said Harvard law
professor Philip B. Heymann, who was criminal division chief in the
Carter administration.
   The strike forces have spent decades tracking crime families and
alliances across state lines. O'Sullivan spent 10 years in Boston,
Edward McDonald headed the Brooklyn program for seven years, and
Joel Friedman directed operations in Philadelphia for 14 years.
   Assistant Attorney General Edward Dennis, head of the Criminal
Division, told a House subcommittee ``there is simply no reason to
anticipate that attrition ... would be any greater'' than usual
under Thornburgh's plan.
   But David Margolis, head of Justice's organized crime section
since 1979, warned in 1987 that many senior prosecutors would leave
under a merger.
   In fact, since Thornburgh unveiled his plan in mid-February, 33
strike force attorneys have quit. In the equivalent period prior to
mid-February, only nine left, department figures show.
   Asked about the losses, Thornburgh's spokesman Dave Runkel said,
``It tells you more about the people who've been involved in those
offices than it does about the merger. If these people were truly
committed to that fight they would have no reason to abandon ship.''
   O'Sullivan disagreed: ``These people worked for years for $7,000
to $10,000 a year less in salary than assistant U.S. attorneys with
half their experience. That's the definition of dedication.''
   The department is losing experienced lawyers like O'Sullivan,
who recognized oblique references on a taped conversation in 1981
to three murders that had occurred in the 1960s. The evidence
became part of an indictment that brought down the hierarchy of the
Boston mob.
   A Thornburgh backer, U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney in Brooklyn,
scoffs at the idea that this expertise is irreplacable. ``FBI
agents and other federal investigators are supposed to be the
experts,'' he said.
   But John Good, the FBI agent who developed the Abscam bribery
investigation of Congress, said the most important factor is having
an ``experienced prosecutor available for complicated cases.''
   Good took Abscam to the Brooklyn strike force chief he'd known
for 12 years rather than to the U.S. attorney, even though it was
not an organized crime case.
   ``Traditionally, assistant U.S. attorneys were there to get
their tickets punched, put two or three years in, make a connection
and get out and get with a major law firm,'' Good said.
   The Brooklyn strike force has been hit especially hard by
resignations in the past year _ 11 of the 15 members have departed,
including McDonald.
   And the Brooklyn strike force was among the most productive in
the nation. Since 1980 it convicted six bosses of the Colombo and
Bonnano families, more than 65 other mobsters, more than 50 union
officials, eight congressmen including the Abscam defendants, more
than 200 businessmen and a host of local officials. Fines,
forfeitures and restitutions have totaled more than $200 million.
   Late last year, Thornburgh himself said that until the
mid-1960s, the mob was run by men in the prime of life but ``today,
the seasoned, upper- and middle-management of this structure has
been devastated by the government's continuous attack.''

   Visitors to Brice Daniels' house next
Thanksgiving are forewarned _ this is his stuffing recipe:
   ``First take the 2 spiter legs and micks them with the 6 pounds
of flesh for 10 minnets on low. Then pour in the 4 grams of blood
and turn it to high untell you can see only blood and islands of
flesh.
   ``Pour it into a bowl, add the 20 ribs, 40 guse eggs, 4 smushed
dog skulls and 6 smushed (skulls). Then hete on 100 degrees for 2
minnets and now add the 4 daddy long legs. Now we have gotten to
the fun part! Reddy, set, stuff the chicken!''
   Not that Brice has ever made this stuffing, which he dubs
``witch's favorite.'' Kathryn Davison, his third-grade teacher at
Burnt Hill Road School in Skillman, N.J., read a New York Times
story in November on ``tried or trendy'' ways to stuff turkey, and
asked her class to devise their own recipes. Several were published
in Wednesday's newspaper.
   Brian O'Toole's stuffing consists of two eggs, a pound of lamb
chops, two pounds of pork and a sand pail of water. Majid Parvez
blends two cobs of corn, one carrot, two rabbits (skinned), a loaf
of bread, six herrings and a lemon shark. The shark and rabbit are
barbecued for six minutes.
   Ned Silhavy takes a sweeter tack: ``5 snikers, 4 milkey ways, 2
bags of gumy bears, { bag of mints, 5 lolipops without the sticks.''

   Erath County Sheriff David Coffee
quit smoking more than a month ago, and he's counting on a friendly
threat and his own fear of embarrassment to keep him clean.
   To make sure no one tries to pair Coffee and cigarettes, the
sheriff posted signs inside the county jail that read:
   ``I, Sheriff David Coffee, will not smoke any more cigarettes as
of 12 a.m. on Nov. 27, 1989. Anyone giving me a cigarette will be
subject to being fired.''
   So far, no one has jeopardized his or her job by offering Coffee
a puff. To help him kick the habit, Coffee was placed under
hypnosis by his chief deputy, Bill Holloway, a licensed hypnotist.
   Coffee said he plans to have more sessions with Holloway to
strengthen his resolve. However, the sheriff said what strengthened
him the most were the signs.
   ``I'd be embarrassed to smoke now,'' he said.
   His deputies say that after Coffee quit smoking his temperament
wasn't as bad as they had expected.
   ``It was harder on him than on the rest of us,'' said Deputy
Rhonda Keiler.

   Over the last 22 years, the organized crime
strike forces of the Justice Department accomplished what had once
seemed impossible _ they broke La Cosa Nostra's code of silence and
sent its leaders to prison.
   The idea began in January 1967 in Buffalo, where the
department's Organized Crime and Racketeering Section established
its first field office. A team of attorneys and agents from various
federal investigative agencies mounted a coordinated attack,
identifying the local organized crime power structure and targeting
its most crucial players for prosecution.
   By November 1968, more than 30 people had been indicted.
   The success was so obvious that Attorney General Ramsey Clark
decided later that year to deploy 19 strike forces around the
country.
   Slowly, working with a single focus from one office in
Washington, they accomplished things never before thought possible.
Using an idea once employed against Prohibition mobster Al Capone,
who was sent to prison on tax charges, they drew on every federal
investigative agency _ the FBI, IRS, drug agencies, the Labor
Department, postal inspectors and others _ on the theory that the
mob broke many laws and conviction on any one could help disrupt
its activities.
   They learned how to move from the bottom of an organization to
the top and break the mobster's code of silence by developing
turncoats along the way, finally prosecuting mob leaders long
thought beyond the reach of the law. They learned how to use new
legislation authorizing electronic surveillance and allowing the
seizure of ill-gotten assets.
   They shepherded the FBI's entry into undercover work and
mastered laws like RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, under which whole crime families could be
prosecuted.
   They undertook to purge organized crime from entire legitimate
industries it had infiltrated.
   They won the trust of many federal investigators, who brought
them even non-organized crime cases, like the Abscam bribery case
involving members of Congress. They fought off attacks in 1974,
1976 and 1987 from U.S. attorneys who wanted control over their
operations.
   Since 1980, the strike forces have convicted the boss and top
henchmen of two crime families in Brooklyn, as well as the
leadership of the Boston mob, the Massachusetts and Connecticut
branches of the Genovese family, the Philadelphia mob, the
Rochester family, the Cleveland mob, the Kansas City family, the
Denver family.
   In addition, they convicted two successive hierarchies of the
Los Angeles mob, the New Orleans boss twice, and the Chicago family
boss.
   Others indicted include the nation's largest pornographer; the
leading Colombian drug kingpin, Pablo Escobar; two Teamster Union
presidents, one of whom became an informant after conviction; a
host of union officers, local officials and policmen, contractors
and union officials who rigged bids on the renovation of New York's
Shea Stadium, banks and brokerage houses that moved mob money and
even mobsters who got a payoff written into the contract to move an
FBI office.
   Cases spanned the country. Pendorf, a Las Vegas casino skimming
prosecution, began in Kansas City and involved electronic
surveillance in Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Wisconsin. Organized
crime leaders from Chicago, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Las Vegas and
Kansas City were convicted.
   Before Attorney General Dick Thornburgh placed them under U.S.
attorneys, the 14 strike forces were located in Boston, Brooklyn,
Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Los
Angeles, Miami, Newark, New Orleans, Philadelphia and San Francisco.
   They had 11 sub-offices in New Haven, Conn.; Providence, R.I.;
Rochester, N.Y.; Syracuse, N.Y.; Milwaukee; Atlanta; Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., Tampa, Fla., Camden, N.J.; Houston and Honolulu.
   Responsibility for their operations has now been dispersed among
23 U.S. attorneys.

   A century-old bridge collapsed while it
was being dismantled, and about 40 people were plunged into a canal
in northeastern Pakistan, officials said Wednesday.
   Fog hampered attempts to recover survivors and bodies after the
Tuesday night accident on the 70-foot-long bridge near the village
of Hafizabad, about 50 miles northwest of Lahore, police said.
   Police abandoned a search along the banks and began stringing
nets downstream.
   Witnesses said seven workers were dismantling the bridge while
several onlookers huddled at either end. It gave way on one side,
tossing one worker and dozens of other people about 16 feet into
the swift Lower Chenab Canal, they said.

   A chemical leak from a broken pipe into the
Kaskaskia River has forced thousands of people to find alternative
sources of water.
   ``We don't think it's a case where there's an obvious and
immediate health hazard, but to be safe, we're recommending that no
one use the water,'' said Joan Muraro of the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency.
   Officials of Quantum USI, which makes alcohol and plastics,
discovered the broken pipe on Monday. The pipe from a
sludge-holding pit leaked about 750,000 gallons of liquid into the
river.
   ``We don't know what's in the sludge and what's in the water,''
Ms. Muraro said. ``It probably has substances that you would not
normally want in your drinking-water supply.''
   The EPA took samples Tuesday.
   Douglas Water Co. provides water to Tuscola, which has a
population of 4,500, and Arcola, with 3,000 people. John Kenny,
water company owner, said the warning, issued Tuesday, could be
lifted by Thursday.

   A federal judge gave a last-chance warning to
those involved in a voter discrimination lawsuit against Los
Angeles County, saying he will not allow any out-of-court
settlement once the trial begins.
   The lawsuit charges that the county prevented a Hispanic from
being elected to the Board of Supervisors by unfairly distributing
the county's huge Hispanic population across several voter
districts.
   Opening arguments were scheduled to start today in the lawsuit,
brought by the U.S. Justice Department and two civil rights groups.
A victory by the plaintiffs would result in a redrawing of the
county's districts.
   ``Abraham Lincoln never split a rail as cleanly as the 1981
supervisorial district boundaries divide the Hispanic community,''
said papers filed Tuesday by the Justice Department.
   As late as Tuesday, the board voted 3-2 against a proposal to
convert the five-member body to seven members, a move that could
have revived settlement talks and stalled the trial.
   ``Once the trial begins, it will proceed until the court renders
its ruling,'' U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon said Tuesday.
``During the trial, the court will not entertain or accept any
settlement discussion or agreement.''
   The lawsuit claims the Board of Supervisors divided the county's
Hispanics among three districts in 1981 to dilute their voting
power in violation of the U.S. Voting Rights Act.
   Although Hispanics make up at least 27 percent of the county's
8.5 million residents, a Hispanic has never been elected to the
board.
   The two sides appeared close to a settlement last month when the
Board of Supervisors agreed to redraw a supervisor's district to
raise the number of Hispanic voters in the area, but the compromise
collapsed.

<HEAD>Education Minister Calls For Stress On Ideology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's education minister has said that
ideological training must be stepped up in the nation's schools to
stave off the ``corrosive influence'' of Western ideas, a newspaper
said Wednesday.
   Li Tieying, head of the State Education Commission, also said
``unstable factors still exist'' on university campuses due to
years of shortcomings in ideological education, the People's Daily
reported.
   Li, in a report on future educational goals delivered to the
national legislature, emphasized that the sharp increase in
political education since the June crackdown on the student-led
pro-democracy movement has not gone far enough.
   ``At the present time the tendency to not pay attention to moral
education is fairly prominent: ideological education is weak;
administration is lax; schools, especially institutions of higher
learning, have to varying degrees received the corrosive influence
of `bourgeois liberalization' and the situation is fairly serious.''
   Chinese authorities say students and others who joined the
spring democracy movement were blinded by bourgeois liberalization,
or attraction to Western ideas and customs.
   Since June, students have been required to take extensive
classes in political dogma and participate in work-study programs
on farms or factories. The entire freshman class at Beijing
University, a center for student activism last spring, was sent to
a neighboring province for a year of military training.
   Li said that as a result of the Communist Party's ``warm loving
care and strict demands,'' the atmosphere on campus is
``comparatively stable.'' But he said the problems are deep-rooted,
and will require a long period of hard work to overcome.
   Despite the government's bloody suppression of dissent and heavy
indoctrination policies, students privately continue to advocate
democratic reform in China and speak with envy of reforms taking
place in East Europe.
   Beijing security forces reportedly increased vigilance around
campuses following the overthrow of the hard-line Communist regime
of Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania, which students marked with parties
and a few furtive attempts to put up anti-government posters.
   Among Li's recommendations were for Communist Party
organizations to play an increased role on campuses, particularly
in providing ideological guidance to teachers.
   Schools, he said, must ``vigorously resolve problems regarding
certain philosophy and social science directions that are not clear
... and problems of deviation from Marxist guidance.''
   Schools should strengthen work-study programs, and draw up
appropriate rules to govern the physical and mental health of
students, he said.
   Li said China's student exchange programs with foreign countries
will continue and gradually expand. But students selected for
academic work abroad generally will be ``in front-line work or
those who have superior political and vocational credentials.''
   The government effectively has stopped sending undergraduates
and graduate students abroad, exacted heavy fees on those wishing
to study overseas at private expense, and imposed stringent
regulations on people seeking leave from jobs to go abroad.
   ``I want to especially point out that those students sent abroad
to study must return and serve the country,'' Li said.
   He referred to a current dispute with the United States, which
is allowing Chinese students fearing persecution at home to extend
their U.S. stays. Even before June, large numbers of Chinese
students were failing to return home after their programs ended.

<HEAD>Linda Leary Denied Bail in Drug Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman extradited from Austria, where she
allegedly lived in luxury, will remain in jail without bond to face
charges she operated an international marijuana-smuggling ring, a
judge has ruled.
   Linda L. Leary, 58, former president of the Indianapolis League
of Women Voters and the local chapter of the National Council of
Jewish Women, might try to flee before her Feb. 13 trial if bail
were granted, U.S. District Judge Larry J. McKinney said Tuesday.
   McKinney said testimony from investigators showed that Leary and
her sons had moved to Austria to escape U.S. jurisdiction.
   His decision overturned a federal magistrate's ruling allowing
bond for Leary. That ruling had been stayed pending prosecutors'
appeal to McKinney, and Leary was never released.
   Leary and her sons, Paul Heilbrunn, 35, and Richard Heilbrunn,
38, were among 34 people indicted in 1987 on charges of allegedly
operating a marijuana-smuggling ring that allegedly shipped at
least 250,000 pounds of the drug to this country.
   Leary and her sons were arrested in May in Austria, where she
had been living since November 1985, and were extradited to Indiana
last month.
   They were living luxurious lifestyles when they were arrested,
authorities said. Paul Heilbrunn lived in a hillside home with a
lake view, while his mother and brother lived in a three-level,
secluded home in Salzburg.
   McKinney said evidence suggested Leary paid $670,000 for her
Austrian house and invested more than $300,000 in a business there.
   After the three were returned to Indianapolis, U.S. Magistrate
John P. Godich ordered the Heilbrunns held pending trial. However,
he said Leary could be released on a $200,000 property bond because
of blood pressure problems that her attorney claimed couldn't be
properly treated in jail.
   McKinney said there was insufficient evidence to show her
condition couldn't be treated in jail.
   Leary faces 12 counts, including conspiracy to distribute
marijuana, money-laundering and interstate transportation in aid of
racketeering. She could be sentenced to 30 years in prison.
   Defense attorney Bernard Pylitt denied that Leary had gone to
Austria to avoid indictment and prosecution, but the judge
disagreed.

<HEAD>Media Hail Lack of Conflict on Integrated Beaches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State radio and a major black
newspaper on Wednesday hailed the lack of racial conflict on newly
integrated beaches that drew huge holiday crowds.
   Police in Durban and Cape Town, the two largest summer vacation
destinations, said there had been no serious racial incidents
during the long New Year's weekend despite the opening of the last
whites-only beaches on the orders of President F.W. de Klerk.
   ``What this demonstrates is that the skies will not fall when
insulting petty apartheid laws are dropped,'' said The Sowetan, the
largest-selling black-oriented daily. ``The country's economy will
improve. There will be a feeling of hope among South Africa's
people.''
   It said beach segregation ``was a monstrous act of expensive
racism.''
   Cape Town police reported one shooting incident at a beachfront
parking lot, and Durban police said there were 53 arrests at local
beaches from Friday through Tuesday. A black man was fatally
stabbed in a fight, and a policeman suffered a knife wound in
another incident in Durban, but The Sowetan said police there
showed ``considerable restraint'' despite occasional taunting from
blacks on the beaches.
   The loudest criticism of beach integration came from the
far-right Conservative Party, which said the government was
destroying ``white community life.''
   Koos van der Merwe, the party's chief spokesman, said beaches
had been littered and ``civilized standards disregarded'' during a
weekend in which beaches had been ``swamped by blacks.''
   Provincial Affairs Minister Hermanus Kriel rejected van der
Merwe's criticisms, saying it was ``unjust and racist'' to blame
only blacks for problems at the beaches. He said the National Party
government would assist local authorities in improving seaside
facilities to accommodate larger crowds.
   Hotel owners around Durban said their facilities were as full as
in previous years despite predictions that some whites from inland
areas would stay away.
   Authorities said about 150,000 people, more than 90 percent of
them black, packed Durban's beachfront on New Year's Day. Mayor
Derrick Waterson said ``nothing abnormal'' occurred.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said in a
commentary the abolition of beach segregation ``has succeeded
beyond the hopes of even the most sanguine.''
   ``Among the hundreds of thousands who flocked to Natal and Cape
beaches over the Christmas and New Year's weekends, not one
incident of racial confrontation of any note was reported,'' the
SABC said. ``The incident free holiday-making ... reflects the
extent to which the last decade's reforms has fostered attitudes of
mutual acceptance among the country's diverse communities.''

   A dome billed by its owners as the world's
largest air-supported structure, covering 14.1 acres, has collapsed
onto the toxic waste dump construction site it was supposed to
protect.
   The dome's owners said it could be days before they know why it
collapsed. ``Anything I said now would be only speculation,'' said
general manager John Stanulonis of CWM Chemical Services Inc.
   The 90-ton dome was inflated Monday morning but collapsed
Tuesday.
   The dome, 120 feet high, 450 feet wide and 1,365 feet long, was
intended to provide round-the-clock shelter for workers and
equipment building a toxic-waste landfill in this northern Niagara
County town. CWM claimed it was the world's largest air-supported
structure.
   Stanulonis said the collapse left the work site inoperable and
he did not know how long it would be before construction could
resume.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet-Iranian border zone played a key role
in Cold War history when the West forced Josef Stalin to abandon
his efforts to create a puppet state in northern Iran.
   Members of the Azerbaijani ethnic group, a Turkic people, live
on both sides of the frontier and are predominantly Shiite Moslems,
like most people in Iran.
   More than 7 million people live in the Soviet republic of
Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea. More than 4 million ethnic
Azerbaijanis live in the adjoining province of northern Iran, also
called Azerbaijan.
   The Red Army moved into northern Iran in 1941 during the first
year of Soviet fighting in World War II. The Soviets signed a
treaty in 1942 along with Britain and Persia, as Iran was then
called, agreeing to ``respect the territorial integrity,
sovereignty and political independence of Persia.'' The Soviets did
not observe it.
   The British withdrew from Iran as agreed within six months of
the end of hostilities with Nazi Germany in 1945, but the Soviets
remained. They demanded oil concessions and under the aegis of the
Red Army set up an independent Azerbaijan Republic in northern Iran
in December 1945. In March 1946, the Soviets also created a Kurdish
Republic in Iran.
   But reaction from the Western powers, the U.N. Security Council
and the Iranian government was firm, and by May 1946, the Soviet
forces withdrew.
   The episode is widely seen as having convinced President Harry
S. Truman that Stalin would back down if resisted. In 1947, he
announced what became known as the ``Truman Doctrine,'' which
proclaimed that further Soviet territorial expansion would be
actively resisted.
   Despite their withdrawal from northern Iran, the Soviets
continued to exert influence through the Persian Communist Party,
Kurdish separatists and an Azerbaijani ``democratic movement,''
effectively keeping the Persians out of the area until December
1946.

<TEXT>
   An 82-year-old man accused of shooting to
death two sheriff's deputies giving him a lift from an accident
scene suffers from bouts of senility, his wife said today.
   Ule Reynolds of Gary, Ind., was behind bars without bail today
on charges of murdering Lauderdale County officers Kevan Ward, 29,
and Bobby Nolen, 55, in their cruiser by shooting them in the back
of the head early Tuesday.
   The deputies never suspected that Reynolds, whose car had become
stuck in a ditch 60 miles north of Memphis, was an ex-convict
illegally carrying a .357-caliber pistol in a shoulder holster,
Deputy Sheriff Bill Danley said.
   Sherifff Milford Durham said officers had not established a
motive and that the man was incoherent when questioned about the
shootings.
   ``We do this all the time _ give people a ride who have
trouble,'' Danley said. ``He was not under arrest. They were just
giving him a ride. We may never know (the motive).''
   Reynolds' wife, Minnie, said today that her husband apparently
got lost while driving to attend the funeral of a cousin about 60
miles east of Memphis. He left Gary Sunday evening, she said.
   Mrs. Reynolds said her husband suffers from bouts of senility
but insisted on making the trip by himself. ``You can't make him do
anything,'' she said. ``He'd been there by himself when he was 81,
so I guess he figured he could do it at 82.''
   Reynolds, who was knocked unconscious and injured an shoulder
when the sheriff's cruiser crashed, could not explain what
happened, and there were no other known witnesses, authorities
said. Investigators were awaiting results of a drug test on
Reynolds. An alcohol test came back negative, Durham said.
   ``We're going to try to talk to him again tomorrow,'' Durham
said Tuesday. ``We tried to talk to him today, and we couldn't make
any sense out of what he was saying.''
   Reynolds was jailed in adjacent Tipton County ``both for his
protection and ours,'' the sheriff said. ``There are bad feelings
about this.''
   Indiana records show Reynolds was charged in 1975 with
attempting to obstruct justice in connection with a drug trial. At
the time of his arrest, Reynolds was armed with a handgun and had
two others nearby. He pleaded guilty possession of a firearm by a
felon. He had been convicted in 1945 of assault, records show.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said today it would
not rule out a third-country destination for ousted Panamanian
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, although it strongly prefers
trying him in the United States.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied that the
administration was moving away from its position that Noriega
should be brought to the United States to face drug-trafficking
charges.
   ``I want to make clear from this podium our positon is we want
him returned to the United Staes,'' Fitzwater told reporters at his
daily briefing. But, he added, ``we will not rule out any and every
other kind of option.''
   Meanwhile, the Pentagon announced that about 500 members of the
Army's 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment would return to their
home base at Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah, Ga., late today from
Panama.
   The unit was among more than 11,000 troops dispatched from U.S.
bases for the Dec. 20 invasion that ousted Noriega from power.
Soldiers from the 7th Infantry Division had returned to Fort Ord,
Calif., earlier.
   Last Saturday, Bush suggested that allowing Noriega to go to a
third country where he could be free from prosecution was no longer
an acceptable option. The United States had proposed, as recently
as last October, a variety of deals that would have allowed Noriega
to step down and go to a third country.
   ``The death of one Marine, the brutalization of a wife of a
lieutenant, the death of a lot of our kids; that's what changed.
And that's why I feel very strongly that we're not back to square
one,'' Bush had said.
   But today, Fitzwater said, ``We've never said no third country.
What we have said is we want him to come back to the United States.
But we are not going to rule out every other alternative.''
   Later, Fitzwater said: ``I did not want to imply any change. Our
position is that we want him returned to the United States for
prosecution. There is absolutely no change in our position.''
   The administration and the Vatican remained at odds on Noriega's
fate _ with the Vatican so far showing little interest in turning
the deposed leader over to U.S. forces.
   Fitzwater, asked about reports that the Vatican would only
release Noriega if he could be guaranteed a fair trial and that his
life would not be in danger, said ``he will receive a fair trial in
this country.''
   Furthermore, the spokesman said, ``Under terms of the
indictments, he is not subject to capital punishment.''
   In a related development, American and Peruvian officials said
today that Peru, which pulled out as a participant in an upcoming
drug summit in Colombia to protest the U.S. invasion of Panama, has
reversed course and will attend the conference.
   Meanwhile, the envoy designated by Panamanian President
Guillermo Endara as ambassador to the Organization of American
States presented his credentials today to OAS officials in
Washingtion, even though he was initially rebuffed by the OAS.
   As of Tuesday, 11 governments have officially recognized the
Endara government and 24 others have indicated acceptance by
establishing contact with the Foreign Ministry, the State
Department said.
   Endara's choice as OAS ambassador is Lawrence Chewning Fabrega,
a career diplomat who broke with Noriega a week after Noriega was
indicted by two Florida grand juries on drug trafficking charges in
February 1988.
   The envoy had been attached to Panama's OAS mission at the time
and has lived in the United States in exile since then, taking part
in the anti-Noriega struggle.
   His tenure as OAS ambassador got off to a rocky start. The envoy
who served under Noriega was allowed to assume Panama's seat when
the OAS took up the Panama question hours after the invasion began.
   After marathon debate, the OAS voted 20-1 to express regret over
the U.S. action.
   Among the countries which have announced recognition of the new
Panamanian government or shown acceptance in other ways are Great
Britain, Luxembourg, Dominica, Barbados, Spain, the Philippines and
Guatemala, Chewning Fabrega said.
   Meanwhile, a special OAS session is scheduled for Friday to hear
a Nicaraguan complaint about the search by U.S. troops last Friday
of the residence of the Nicaraguan ambassador to Panama.
   President Bush said the incident was the result of a mistake.
Nicaragua retaliated by expelling 20 U.S. diplomats from Managua.
   On Tuesday, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger was
sent to Panama for talks with Endara on ways for the United States
to help recovery from two years of steep economic decline.
   Also, the White House announced on Tuesday the appointment of
career diplomat Deane Hinton as ambassador to Panama. Hinton, 66, a
leading State Department expert on Central America, currently
serves as ambassador to Costa Rica and also was former President
Reagan's first ambassador to El Salvador.

<TEXT>
   South Korea's unification minister has
declared an ``era of exchange'' in its relations with North Korea,
urging the communist nation to open economic and non-political
cooperation on the divided peninsula.
   ``The year 1990 will be an era of exchange,'' Unification
Minister Lee Hong-koo said in an interview with Yonhap, the South
Korean news agency, published Wednesday.
   He said South Korea will seek active dialogue with North Korea
and that a government fund would be set up to expedite economic
cooperation and other exchanges. He said the fund would be
subsidized by private business groups anxious to initiate trade and
investment with North Korea.
   Lee was skeptical about any immediate change in North Korea
under the unchallenged leadership of President Kim Il Sung and said
non-political exchanges must precede politics to end decades-long
distrust between the two rivals.
   He said South Korea's basic unification policy was aimed at
gradual disarmament after signing a peace treaty with North Korea.
``Talks on arms reduction must be held after the two Koreas declare
a non-aggression pact,'' he said.
   South Koreans would be allowed gradually to watch North Korean
television and read the Communist Party newspaper, Lee said. Some
North Korean TV programming already is available in South Korea.
   In a New Year's speech, Kim proposed talks on breaking down a
concrete border wall to ensure free travel between the nations,
reiterating a call for a conference that would include leaders of
Seoul's government and opposition parties.
   Kim said he was ready to remove ``barbed wires which mark a
boundary,'' contending no border barrier exists on the North Korean
side.
   A South Korean government statement called Kim's proposal
``empty propaganda'' intended to avoid international and internal
pressure to open Pyongyang's closed society.
   ``There is no concrete barrier in our area south of the
demarcation line,'' said a South Korean government statement. It
said Kim's New Year call was intended to ``dilute our initiatives''
in unification talks.
   North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, triggering a three-year
war, and a peace treaty was never signed.
   They are separated by the 2{-mile-wide demilitarized zone under
a 1953 armistice, but the border on both sides is sealed by
concrete bunkers, mine fields, barbed wires, and heavily armed
soldiers.
   Outside the DMZ and on roads leading to it, South Korea has
built up roadblocks, concrete walls and other obstacles to guard
against surprise attacks.
   North Korea pushed for military talks with South Korea last
year, but Seoul claims people, political and cultural exchange
talks must be held before military discussions. Little progress has
been made in the talks with each side insisting on its own
proposals.
   Seoul officials believe North Korea has never given up its
intention to communize South Korea and that its proposals have been
aimed at inciting unrest and forcing the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S.
forces stationed in South Korea.

<HEAD>Hostage-Taker Kiritsis Seeks Billions for the 11 Years He Was
Confined</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who spent nearly 11 years in penal and
mental institutions after holding a mortgage company executive
hostage at gunpoint has filed more than 100 lawsuits in connection
with his case.
   Anthony G. Kiritsis has sued former governors, doctors, lawyers
and judges, accusing them of such things as false arrest and
imprisonment, slander, intentional infliction of pain and
suffering, and malicious prosecution. He is seeking $250 million in
compensatory damages and $750 million in punitive damages from each.
   He was taken into custody in February 1977 after abducting and
holding for 63 hours a mortgage executive, Richard O. Hall, whom he
had blamed for some financial problems.
   The case drew wide attention after Kiritsis demanded to speak on
television to publicize his grievances and was shown parading Hall
around, holding a gun wired to the back of Hall's head. Kiritsis
finally surrendered peacefully and was found not guilty by reason
of insanity.
   Kiritsis, 55, has been living in an apartment since his
court-ordered release from Central State Hospital in early 1988.
During most of the years he spent in confinement, he refused
psychiatric examinations. After he finally agreed to be examined, a
judge ruled that the state had failed to prove he was still a
danger to society and allowed his release.
   The lawsuits began arriving at the county clerk's office
Thursday. The office assigned four workers to tally them Tuesday.
   In addition to the 100 lawsuits against individuals, a 101st
lawsuit was filed against ``unknown parties'' who could be named
later.
   In petitions accompanying the lawsuits Kiritsis claims that his
only source of income is a trust fund which pays his living
expenses. He requested the court to declare him a pauper and seeks
a court-appointed attorney to help him pursue the lawsuits.

<HEAD>Eternity in a Pub: Oh Death Where Is Thy Sting?</HEAD>

   A company has come up with the ultimate ``last
call'' for people whose idea of heaven is a cozy English pub.
   For $8,000, customers can have their ashes rest under their
favorite stools or beneath the bar where they bent their elbows and
be toasted every year as a not-quite-absent friend.
   ``Instead of being stuck in a cold graveyard in a cemetery where
few people visit, the deceased will be surrounded by friends who
will have a permanent reminder of the good times they enjoyed,''
says Colm O'Rourke, owner of the Little Pub Co.
   Brewers Society spokesman Mike Ripley said he doubted anyone
would ever be buried in a pub.
   ``It's a very silly story,'' Ripley said. ``I suspect the idea
was thought up at 11:55 on New Year's Eve and if someone had told
me tomorrow was April First I wouldn't be at all surprised.''
   The Home Office, which regulates burials, said there were no
regulations prohibiting ashes being buried in pubs _ unless the
corpse is already buried. Exhumations are not allowed.
   The Little Pub Co. is offering eternal rest at the Pack Horse,
the Little Tumbling Sailor or any of the other of its 10 pubs in
western England, said the company's attorney, Jack Haywood.
   Haywood describes O'Rourke as ``an Irish millionaire who's
completely barmy with these weird and wonderful pubs.''
   O'Rourke, 39, wants his ashes buried in the Pack Horse in his
home village of Bewdley in Worcestershire, 95 miles northwest of
London.
   ``I am going to be buried in one of our larger pubs, since I'm a
big guy,'' said Haywood, who has selected the Pie Factory pub in
Tipton. ``Since my wife always finds me there she will be used to
visiting me there.''
   The plan was born, Haywood admitted, ``when we'd had far too
much to drink.''
   At the White Lion in Cradley Heath, 100 miles northwest of
London, manager Brian Robinson said several regulars told him they
wanted to be buried amid the pints and the pub grub.
   Robinson said interest centered on a spot directly in front of
the pub's best brew, Lumphammer Bitter.
   Sam McCormack, operations manager at the Little Pub Co.
headquarters in Kidderminster, said the plan was indirectly
inspired by the death of a customer at the Pack Horse.
   ``We were holding a retirement party for (him),'' Mrs. McCormack
said. ``The man went home to change and didn't come back. Everyone
was very upset.''
   The brass plaque erected in his memory inspired the ashes
scheme, Mrs. McCormack said.
   Dead customers could be accommodated anywhere in the pub,
Haywood said. The fee would include an urn, a brass plaque and the
annual wake.
   ``Why not give people the chance once they're cremated to be put
in a block behind the bar as opposed to being scattered over a golf
course?'' Haywood said.
   ``My family would certainly come and visit me,'' Robinson said,
``if I were buried in a pub.''

<HEAD>White House Cites Role of Women in Panamanian Invasion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Panama, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House said Wednesday that female
soldiers served ``with great distinction'' in the U.S. invasion of
Panama, including a captain of military police who led her platoon
against armed Panamanian Defense Forces.
   Three PDF soldiers were killed in that battle, led by Army Capt.
Linda L. Bray, commander of the 988th Military Police Company.
   U.S. law and Army regulations prohibit women from serving in
jobs designated as ``combat'' roles by the military.
   But women now make up 11 percent of the U.S. military, and as
their numbers have grown, so have their responsibilities.
   Bray's company had been sent to Panama from Fort Benning, Ga.,
on a regular rotation a week before the Dec. 20 invasion that
toppled dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked if the Pentagon
had expected female soldiers to get into the fighting, said:
   ``The women have been carrying out important functions within
the military now for some time. Those responsibilities are well
established and laid out by their training and assignments. ... We
think they performed with great distinction.''
   When a reporter suggested that the heavily-guarded attack-dog
kennel that Bray's company took out was not a very difficult
target, Fitzwater snapped:
   ``It's unfair to belittle the action by referring to this as dog
kennels. It was heavily defended. Three PDF men were killed.
Gunshots were fired on both sides. American troops could have been
killed,'' he said.
   ``It was an important military operation. A woman led it and she
did an outstanding job and the fact is that role has been
anticipated from the first day she was given that assignment,'' the
presidential spokesman said.
   None of the 23 U.S. soldiers killed in the Panama invasion were
women. The Pentagon says of the 24,500 troops and officers involved
in the operation, 600 were women _ including 170 from units flown
in for the invasion and 430 already station in Panama.
   Women served not only in the military police, but in support
roles for the infantry, intelligence units, a signal battalion and
the headquarters of the 18th Airborne Corps. Four women provided
support services for special operations teams involved in some of
the heaviest fighting.
   Fitzwater said these women soldiers have been in those roles
``for some time. They weren't just put into them the first day of
the Panama invasion.''
   Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., chairwoman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on military installations, said Wednesday she
will introduce legislation when Congress reconvenes to allow Army
women to enter all military specialities including combat for a
four-year test period. A defense advisory committee recently
recommended such a move.
   Schroeder said in an interview that Bray's experience ``showed
how silly the whole combat exclusion is. There's no such thing as
being excluded from combat when you're in a Panama-type of
situation.''
   Had the Army known the kennel was going to be heavily defended,
``they would have sent in an armored unit,'' not a company of
M.P.s, she said.
   But in a battle zone like Panama, she said, ``everything could
be combat.''

<HEAD>First Lady Starts 10 Days Of Radiation Therapy For Eye Condition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First lady Barbara Bush underwent on Wednesday
the first of 10 daily radiation treatments in a new medical effort
to control the effects of Graves' disease, an immune system ailment
that earlier attacked her thyroid gland.
   Mrs. Bush spent three hours at Walter Reed Army Medical Center
and then returned to the White House. Only 10 minutes of the
hospital visit were actually spent in radiation therapy, a
spokeswoman said.
   After returning from Walter Reed, the 64-year-old first lady
went for her customary one-mile swim in the White House outdoor
pool.
   ``She said it was like a trip to the dentist only better,'' said
Mrs. Bush's press secretary, Anna Perez.
   Doctors plan to use brief, low-level radiation treatments daily
for the next nine days on Mrs. Bush in hopes of halting a swelling
in the small muscles that control movements of the eyes.
   Medical experts not associated with the case said that such
treatment is routine for Graves' disease eye patients who have not
responded to other therapy. The radiation treatment is not
considered dangerous and has a high rate of success, say the
experts.
   ``The published studies report 60 to 90 percent of patients have
a favorable response to this treatement,'' said Dr. Joshua Cohen,
an endocrinology specialist at George Washington University Medical
Center. ``In general, the response is very good.''
   Dr. David Cooper, chief of endrocrinology at Sinai Hospital in
Baltimore and an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins
University, said that radiation treatment of the eye effects of
Graves' disease ``is a fairly routine sort of thing. There's a very
high success rate _ over 80 percent.''
   Cooper said the radiation dose used is very low and rarely
causes any side effects such as nausea or hair loss that are common
side effects from the powerful radiation doses used in cancer
therapy.
   Dr. Richard C. Eastman, chief of endocrinology at Georgetown
Hospital, said that some rare patients develop cateracts.
   ``Cateracts are a concern any time you use radiation on the
eye,'' he said.
   A White House statement said the radiation treatments will not
prevent Mrs. Bush from carrying out her normal schedule.
   Doctors first diagnosed Graves' disease last year after Mrs.
Bush experienced weight loss and other symptoms of an overactive
thyroid. She underwent treatment with drugs and with radioactive
iodine to destroy or disable her flawed thyroid gland. But the
treatment apparently did not cure the inflamation of muscles in the
eye, a common symptom of Graves' disease.
   Uncorrected, the eye condition can lead to blindness in a small
percentage of patients, but Cooper said that generally the eye
ailment caused by Graves' disease is mild and self-limiting.
   Graves disease, named for a 19th century Irish physician who
first described it, is caused when the body's immune system starts
attacking the parts of the body itself.
   The primary targets are cells in the thyroid gland and in the
small muscles back of the eyeball that control the matched movement
of the eyes. Just why these two, dissimilar organs are attacked are
unknown.
   ``We don't really know what causes Graves' disease,'' said
Eastman. ``We do know that there's a genetic predisposition, and
that women are more apt to get the disease than men. Stress has
been implicated as a trigger for the disease, but we really don't
know why.''
   Typically, patients with Graves' experience an increase in
thyroid hormone secretion. This leads to a higher metabolic rate, a
loss of weight and, sometimes, changes in the heart beat. Doctors
correct this problem by disabling or destroying the thyroid with
steroids or with radiation therpy.
   Mrs. Bush underwent this treatment in April.
   But patients quite often, said the experts, continue to
experience an autoimmune inflamation of the eye muscles.
Eventually, the eyes stop tracking properly and the patient can
develop double vision.
   A White House spokesperson said earlier that Mrs. Bush was
seeing double.
   She was treated with prednisone, a powerful steroid that often
controls the condition. When this failed, Cohen said the usual next
step is radiation.
   Should the radiation fail, surgery ``would be indicated'', said
Cohen, to relieve the pressure in the eye socket or to reattach
malfunctioning muscles. Such treatment may require a series of
operations, but Cohen said that surgery is only needed for only a
very few Graves' disease patients.

<HEAD>Study Finds Leading Long-Term Care Policies Inadequate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the best long-term-care insurance
policies on the market in 1988 provided inadequate protection
against the staggering costs of nursing home care, according to a
private study released Wednesday.
   The study, supported by a grant from the American Association of
Retired Persons, analyzed policies offered by 11 leading companies
and concluded that many ``failed to achieve the basic purpose for
which they were bought.''
   ``Many of them failed to provide much protection against the
uncertainty of paying high out-of-pocket costs for nursing home
care,'' the study said.
   Private insurance coverage for nursing home costs was virtually
non-existent until the 1980s, but the market has grown rapidly in
recent years.
   More than 100 companies now offer long-term-care insurance and
more than 1.3 million policies had been purchased by mid-1989,
according to the Health Insurance Association of America.
Association spokesman Richard Coorsh said HIAA had not seen the
AARP report and had no immediate comment.
   The AARP report found wide variations and coverage options among
the policies studied and said it was difficult to determine how
companies would interpret the restrictions in their policies,
leaving ``a great deal of uncertainty'' over how much of nursing
home costs would be covered.
   Applying both strict and lenient interpretations to each policy
analyzed, the study found that the policies might reduce
out-of-pocket spending on nursing homes by anywhere from 12.1
percent to 62.6 percent.
   ``Even if a person buys the most generous policy, he or she
faces a great deal of uncertainty about how much the policy will
pay,'' the study said.
   The cost of nursing home care averages about $2,000 a month. An
estimated 40 percent of all elderly people will spend some time in
a nursing home before their death, with half of all stays lasting
six months or less and the other half averaging 2.5 years,
according to HIAA.
   The AARP report analyzed policies marketed from May through July
of 1988, and acknowledged that there have been subsequent
improvements in many long-term-care policies. The study was
conducted by Thomas Rice and Kathleen Thomas of the University of
North Carolina and William Weissert of the University of Michigan.
   The researchers said most of the policies studied substantially
reduced expected payments by denying benefits to people who went
into nursing homes without first being hospitalized, and by
providing benefits only for those people requiring skilled nursing
home care.
   The findings ``confirm the wisdom'' of a December 1988
recommendation by the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners that states prohibit the sale of policies with prior
hospitalization or level-of-care requirements, the study said.
   It said two other problem areas that need to be addressed are
the lack of inflation adjustments in policies and limits on the
length of coverage for nursing home stays.
   The report recommended that the NAIC expand its model
regulations to require that policies cover at least four years in a
nursing home and offer some form of inflation protection.
   ``Provisions such as these will raise premiums, but will
substantially reduce the uncertainty faced by individuals who
purchase policies and subsequently receive care in a nursing
home,'' it said.
   Policies from the following companies were analyzed, but
specific information on each policy was not provided: Aetna,
American Express-Fireman's Fund, American Progressive, Bankers Life
and Casualty, Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Indiana, Equitable Life and
Casualty, Great Republic, John Hancock, Prudential, Transport Life
and Travelers.

<HEAD>Japan Seeks Greater Peace Role in Cambodia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japan may send a representative to
Cambodia for the first time since the Indochina war ended in 1975
and wants a greater role in seeking peace there, a Japanese Foreign
Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
   Seiichi Kondo, the spokesman, was reporting on a meeting earlier
in the day between Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan and the
Japanese foreign minister, Taro Nakayama, who arrived Tuesday for
an official visit.
   ``The Japanese government is seriously considering the
possibility of dispatching a Foreign Ministry official to Phnom
Penh to get first-hand information on the situation of Cambodia,''
Kondo told a news conference.
   Siddhi Savetsila, the Thai foreign minister, said senior
officials of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations planned to
meet soon to discuss peace proposals for Cambodia put forth the
United States, Australia and Thailand.
   Kondo said a senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official, Sakutaro
Tanino, was to meet Thursday in Bangkok with Michael Costello,
deputy foreign secretary of Australia, to discuss Australian
suggestions.
   Last month, British government officials visited Cambodia to
assess development needs. Britain was the first Western country to
accept Vietnam's assertion that it had withdrawn its troops from
Cambodia at the end of September after nearly 11 years of
occupation.
   On Wednesday, Kondo said Japan wanted to send someone to Phnom
Penh ``as soon as possible,'' but no date had been set. Japanese
officials said privately that Masaharu Kohno, a Southeast Asia
specialist at the Foreign Ministry, probably would make the trip in
February.
   Japan and many other governments withdrew their diplomats from
Phnom Penh in 1975 after the takeover by the brutal Khmer Rouge
regime, which killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians before the
Vietnamese invasion of December 1978. The Japanese Embassy was not
reopened after the invasion.
   At the news conference, Kondo said the Japanese official's visit
would be informal and ``does not mean that Japan recognizes'' the
government of Premier Hun Sen, which Vietnam sponsors.
   He said the purpose would be to assess the economic aid needed
to rebuild Cambodia after the end of hostilities between the Hun
Sen government and a three-party guerrilla alliance, which includes
the Khmer Rouge. Japan and Western nations recognize the alliance.
   Japan has not formally accepted Vietnam's statement that its
soldiers are out of Cambodia. The withdrawal was not monitored by
international observers.
   Kondo said Nakayama told Thai officials Japan considered 1990
``the most important year for the realization of peace in
Cambodia.'' He said his government hoped to play a peace role by
encouraging dialogue between China, which backs the Khmer Rouge,
and the Soviet Union, which supports Vietnam.
   He quoted Nakayama as saying the impact of democratic reform in
Eastern Europe would ``inevitably come to Asia.'' He said Siddhi,
the Thai foreign minister, predicted gradual changes in Asia's
Communist nations.

<HEAD>Founder of Failed Home Leaves State, But Says He Won His Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELLEVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a one-man crusade to open
a home for people with AIDS has left town, emotionally battered and
financially strapped but insisting Wednesday that his was a
successful fight to change attitudes.
   ``I've never felt that I failed,'' Charles Baxter said about the
home he closed after only a few months. ``It opened the door and it
made it possible for others to get help.''
   Baxter, 44, loaded a van with his belongings Tuesday and left
the area. He said he doesn't know if he'll return.
   ``I need a fresh start. I don't think people can ever imagine
what I went through,'' he said in a telephone interview from an
uncle's home in Kansas City, Kan.
   Baxter, a longtime home health-care provider, spent nearly a
year battling city officials who opposed his plan. He opened Our
Place in September after he and the American Civil Liberties Union
won a federal court case challenging Belleville's refusal to grant
him a special zoning permit.
   Our Place briefly housed three men with the AIDS virus, two of
whom died at the home. Baxter closed the leased facility in
mid-November, saying donations needed to cover operating costs
never materialized.
   He financed what he did accomplish by selling his home in
Highland, about 20 miles north, as well as his truck and other
belongings.
   Controversy over the project ``hurt us a lot,'' Baxter said,
turning some people against the effort and likely reducing the flow
of needed contributions.
   ``But the nice thing about it, as a result of what we did there,
(AIDS homes) are springing up all over the country. I think we
accomplished a lot,'' he said.
   Baxter's departure sparked mixed feelings in this city of 45,000
people, across the Mississippi River from St. Louis.
   ``He helped change the awareness and the acceptance that (AIDS)
is a concern for communities as a whole to address,'' said Scott
Schanuel, executive director of Belleville Economic Progress Inc.
   Schanuel predicts Baxter's fight will pave the way for other
AIDS homes, though he said the closure ``proved to many ... that
there are more questions than there are answers'' about dealing
with people with AIDS.
   Mayor Richard Brauer, an opponent of the shelter, said he did
not wish Baxter ill and believes ``there might have been a place
for that house'' in a more rural setting.
   The city initially denied Baxter a special zoning permit on
grounds that he would be unable to fund the project and lacked
medical expertise to care for AIDS patients. Officials also
objected to the home's proximity to downtown and a junior high
school.
   But U.S. District Judge William Stiehl ruled that the city's
denial violated a new provision of the Fair Housing Act barring
discrimination against the handicapped.
   ACLU attorney John Hammel said the ruling was the first to apply
the provision to AIDS patients and would clear the way for future
establishment of AIDS homes.
   Baxter recently settled his damage claim against the city out of
court for $29,000, but said he had just $2,000 left after paying
bills _ not enough to keep Our Place open.

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The interim leadership announced
Wednesday it had chosen an 11-member executive committee, led by
President Ion Iliescu, that apparently will have ultimate authority.
   Col. Gen. Vasile Ionel, army chief of staff, denied foreign news
reports the uprising that overthrew dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was
planned months in advance, but said discontent had been increasing
in the army, intelligentsia and general population.
   ``The revolution was spontaneous, but the discontent had been
piling up for years,'' he told reporters. ``Civilians and the
military alike had felt the hardships. The army was dissatisfied by
the way it was treated as a labor force on huge projects without
any benefit for Romania.''
   Ionel said at least 196 soldiers had died fighting for the
revolution.
   A soldier was seriously wounded by a sniper's bullet overnight,
a reminder that the fight continued against holdout members of
Ceausecu's hated security police, known as the Securitate.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, the second most powerful person
in Romania, were deposed Dec. 22 and executed on Dec. 25.
   In another announcement Wednesday, the leadership said it was
scrapping three organizations set up by Ceausescu, which had the
stated purpose of exercising popular control over his government.
   Rompres, the official news agency, reported that the National
Salvation Front had created the executive committee.
   Romania also has a Cabinet, led by Premier Petre Roman, but real
authority lies with the Front, which has has assumed legislative
powers and chose the premier. The council membership, as reported
by the news agency, did not include Roman.
   Dumitru Mazilu was chosen first deputy to Iliescu on the
executive committee, Rompres reported. Mazilu criticized the former
regime in a report smuggled out of Romania this fall to the U.N.
Human Rights Commission in Geneva, where he worked until Ceausescu
put him under house arrest in 1987.
   Smaller groups within the executive committee have
responsibility for human rights, constitutional matters, foreign
policy, the economy, reconstruction, national minorities and other
areas, the agency reported.
   Some additions were made Wednesday to Roman's Cabinet, including
ministers for geology, the mines, post office and communications,
foreign trade and a president of the foreign trade bank, it said.
   The National Salvation Front has moved rapidly to dismantle the
agencies Ceausescu used control of the country.
   Rompres said the Committee for Problems of Popular Councils, the
Central Council for Workers' Control of Economic and Social
Activity and the Council of Economic and Social Organization were
put out of business Wednesday.
   Although their ostensible purpose was to provide links between
Ceausescu and the citizens, the councils had no powers.
   Ionel, the chief of staff, said ``there is a high number of dead
all over the country'' from the fighting, but ``just how many died
in the revolution will be found out later.''
   He said 196 army officers and non-commissioned officers had been
killed and more than 450 wounded. He did not give a figure for
common soldiers, who presumably would do most of the fighting.
   ``The army is in control of the situation, but we continue to be
careful,'' Ionel said. ``Some vital facilities are still under
guard.''
   Thousands of Securitate members have been reported arrested, but
hundreds are said to remain at large. Ionel said those arrested
were ``being interrogated and will be punished according to their
deeds.''
   Romanians say thousands of people died in the revolution, many
of them anti-Ceausescu protesters killed by Securitate members, but
the actual casualty toll is not known.
   At his news conference, Ionel said soldiers refused orders to
fire on protesters in the western city of Timisoara, where the
revolution began Dec. 15, ``but some elements of the security
troops had infiltrated into the army and fired upon the people.''
   At least six political parties have been formed and some have
begun laying out their objectives in advance of free elections
promised for April.
   Nicolae Costel, a 38-year-old school administrator and spokesman
for the Romanian Democratic Party, recommended delaying the
elections.
   The Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party also has urged
postponement, contending that early elections give candidates of
the interim government an unfair advantage.
   Silviu Brucan, a member of the National Salvation Front, said
Monday it probably would enter candidates in the elections.
   Costel said his party would be similar to Social Democratic
parties in the West, ``since people ... have become allergic to the
word socialism.''
   He said his party sought free elections in the second half of
1990, free unions and the right to strike, elimination of the
Communist Party monopoly on power, free travel, continued
membership in the Warsaw Pact, and possible membership in the
European Economic Community.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Raises Estimate of Oil Spill to as Much as 545,000

   More than 500,000 gallons of heating oil,
not 5,000, may have leaked into the busy Arthur Kill shipping
channel from a break in an Exxon pipeline, the Coast Guard said
Wednesday.
   Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Crawley said Exxon issued the new
estimate after taking an inventory of its supplies. He said 420,000
to 546,000 gallons could have leaked.
   The Coast Guard previously estimated 5,000 gallons of the
lightweight No. 2 oil had spilled into the channel, which separates
Staten Island, N.Y., from New Jersey. The spill, discovered Tuesday
morning, resulted from a break in a 12-inch pipe at Exxon's Bayway
Terminal, part of the oil giant's largest East Coast refinery.
   Crews continue work Wednesday to contain the floating oil,
setting up booms to trap the oil, laying out absorbent material,
skimming it off the surface or absorbing it with vacuums.
   Exxon spokesman Louis Jung said divers had determined there was
a 4-foot by half-inch gash in the underwater pipe, which connects
the Exxon plant in Bayonne to its Bayway Refinery and Chemical
Plant in Linden.
   ``Divers confirmed the line was struck or hit by something, it
did not fail,'' he said.
   A four-member emergency Coast Guard strike force was on its way
from its base in Mobile, Ala., Crawley said.
   Jung said the discrepancy in the size of the spill may have been
due to confusion over whether the initial figures referred to
barrels or gallons of oil. There are 42 gallons in a barrel of oil.
   Jung said the 6.7-mile-long pipe carries oil to several holding
tanks, each of which had to be checked to test its level before the
size of the spill could be determined.
   The spill produced a slick estimated at 11 miles long, in a
heavily industrial area already badly polluted, said Jeanine
Mosley, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental
Protection.
   Oil also has washed ashore along a six-mile area on the the west
coast of Staten Island, she said.
   Ms. Mosley said state regulators were awaiting further
information before assessing the full damage caused by the spill.

<HEAD>Vice President to Attend Honduran President's Inauguration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle will attend the Jan.
27 inauguration of the new president of Honduras, and will visit
Europe next month, his spokesman said Wednesday.
   Quayle's schedule includes a one-day visit to Honduras for the
inauguration of Rafael Leonardo Callejas, the National Party
candidate who defeated Carlos Flores of the incumbent Liberal Party
in November, said Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith.
   Sources said the possibility of additional stops in the region _
such as Panama or El Salvador _ were under consideration.
   Flores, an agricultural economist trained at Mississippi State
University, is a conservative with pro-U.S. views, but also favors
the departure of U.S.-backed Contra rebels from camps in Honduras
near the Nicaraguan border.
   The vice president will be in Europe from Feb. 4 through Feb.
11, with stops planned at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium;
Geneva; Bonn and Munich, West Germany, and London, where British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will host an official dinner for
him.
   ``He wants to consult with our allies on U.S.-European issues of
the '90s,'' Beckwith said.
   Quayle may also visit Berlin and Czechoslovakia.
   The vice president's journey will come at a volatile time in
Europe, when East Bloc countries are rapidly dismantling old
communist economic and political systems, and the West is
evaluating its defense and trade relations.
   Quayle, who heads the White House Council on Competitiveness,
will be focusing in part on trade issues as the European nations
prepare for the 1992 lowering of trade barriers and move toward a
common currency.

   A stock deal in which the government contends
Charles H. Keating Jr. stripped his Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association of $12 million in potential profits was defended
Wednesday by attorneys for the Phoenix millionaire.
   Accusing the government of ``Monday morning quarterbacking,''
Keating's attorneys contended in U.S. District Court that federal
thrift regulations precluded Lincoln from exercising an option to
repurchase the 79,275 shares of Memorex common stock in late
October 1987, four months after selling it.
   The stock transaction is one of four deals that regulators have
cited as examples of ``unsafe and unsound'' practices that
justified their takeover of the Irvine, Calif., thrift last April.
   All of the transactions are being examined by U.S. District
Court Judge Stanley Sporkin as part of a suit by Keating against
the government seeking to undo the takeover.
   In turn, the government has filed a $1.1 billion civil
racketeering and fraud suit against Keating that is now before a
federal judge in Phoenix, and a grand jury in Los Angeles is
weighing possible criminal charges against him.
   Keating also is the central figure in a congressional ethics
investigation. Five senators accepted a total of $1.3 million in
campaign and other contributions from him and then interceded with
federal thrift regulators on Lincoln's behalf.
   In November, he claimed Fifth Amendment protection against
self-incrimination in refusing to answer questions before the House
Banking Committee. But he is expected to be called as a witness
again Friday in his suit against the government, attorneys said.
   Regulators now claim that Lincoln's loss of federally insured
deposits through direct land and stock investments by Keating and
``sham'' real estate sales eventually could cost taxpayers up to $2
billion, making it the most expensive of nearly 600 S&amp;L failures in
the past two years.
   The Memorex deal dates back to December 1986 when Lincoln
acquired the 79,275 shares for a dollar each as a sweetener for
buying $40 million of junk bonds as part of a leveraged buyout
attempt by British financier Sir James Goldsmith to acquire the
company.
   The following April and May, Lincoln sought to sell the stock to
its holding company, American Continental Corp., for $35 a share,
which would have yielded the thrift a profit of $2.7 million.
   Regulators, however, refused to allow the sale, believing the
stock was worth much more than $35 a share.
   To get around the regulations, the government claims, Keating
called upon Phoenix developer and stock broker E.C. Garcia to act
as a ``conduit'' to transfer ownership of the stock from Lincoln to
American Continental.
   Keating, reportedly telling Garcia that the stock was worth $126
per share or about $10 million, arranged for Lincoln to sell it to
him in June 1987 for $1 million or about $12.50 a share with an
option to purchase it back for $4.25 million or about $53.50 a
share.
   When the stock market crashed the following October, Garcia told
the Securities and Exchange Commission that he was in desperate
need for cash and that he sold the stock to American Continental
for $2 million or about $25.25 per share.
   Six months later, in March and April of 1988, American
Continental sold the stock for $167 a share or $13.3 million,
reaping a total profit of $12 million.
   Kevin O'Connell, the government's chief regulator in the case,
testified Wednesday that American Continental's purchase of the
stock denied Lincoln the profit and amounted to a ``usurpation of
corporate opportunity'' that violated rules regulating the
relationship between S&amp;Ls and their holding companies.
   One of Keating's attorneys, Michael Kennedy, however, contended
that Lincoln could not have repurchased the Memorex shares because
regulators at the time were claiming that it already exceeded
imposed limits on direct investments by thrifts in land and stock.
   Kennedy accused the regulators of ``Monday morning
quarterbacking,'' saying officials in O'Connell's office would
likely have objected to any stock purchase by Lincoln within the
week after the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash.
   In reponse to a question, O'Connell acknowledged that it was
impossible to predict the crash when Lincoln sold the stock to
Garcia as well as several events favorable to Memorex _ just as a
10-for-1 stock split _ early in 1988 that boosted its value
dramatically after American Continental purchased it.

<HEAD>Communist Leaders Meet With Opposition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leaders held their first
meeting Wednesday with opposition groups in talks that could result
in formation of a transitional government until free elections are
held.
   Communist Party spokesman Ivan Angelov said delegates from the
Union of Democratic Forces, a group of opposition organizations,
concentrated on discussing political reform during the three-hour
meeting at the National Assembly, the BTA news agency reported.
   The Communists urged discussion on economic reforms, BTA quoted
Angelov as saying.
   The talks were scheduled after the independent trade union,
Podkrepa, one of the groups in the Union of Democratic Forces,
threatened a general strike if the Communists did not agree to
share power.
   The strike, which would have been the first in Bulgaria since
World War II, was called off after the Communists agreed to the
talks.
   The Communist Party leader and president, Petar Mladenov, who
replaced hard-line party chief Todor Zhivkov on Nov. 10, has
pledged widespread reforms and free elections by May.
   Opposition groups allowed to operate since Zhivkov's ouster have
one demand in common _ the end to the Communists' monopoly on power.
   A special parliamentary session has been moved up to Jan. 15 to
discuss scrapping Article 1 of the Constitution that guarantees the
party a ``leading role'' in society.
   But reform is complicated by ethnic tensions. The Communists'
decision last week to return minority rights to Bulgaria's ethnic
Turkish population sparked mass demonstrations.
   In Kurdjali, 250 miles southeast of Sofia, the Committee for the
Defense of National Interests was formed last week by Communists
and non-Communists to protest the decision.
   It threatened a ``warning strike'' on Friday.

   The publisher of The Jerusalem Post refused
Wednesday to sign a pledge to stay out of the newspaper's editorial
process, an issue that prompted 30 reporters and editors to resign
this week.
   During a meeting called by the journalists' union, publisher
Yehuda Levy also rejected demands that vacant posts be filled from
within the paper, and he refused to rehire the reporters and
editors who quit in the dispute.
   ``I'm not going to make it into a kibbutz,'' said Levy, a former
army officer. He took the job in July, three months after the
Canadian newspaper group Hollinger Inc. bought the Post.
   ``I will not tell you what to write, and I will not tell you
what not to write,'' Levy said, but he rejected staff requests that
he sign a statement promising not to interfere in the editorial
process.
   The journalists who quit said in identical letters of
resignation that ``there has been an ever-increasing erosion of
editorial independence accompanied by an assault on the editorial
line which the paper has embodied since its establishment.''
   They included Managing Editor David Landau, Features and
Magazine Editor Joanna Yehiel and Middle East Editor Yehuda Litani.
   Although one of the smallest of Israel's seven major daily
newspapers, the Post, published in English, has great influence.
Foreign diplomats and journalists are among its readers, and its
weekly international edition reaches as many as 50,000 readers
abroad.
   The Post has been a leader in covering the Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The newspaper's top editor, Erwin Frenkel, quit Dec. 25 over a
letter Levy had written to the Editors' Committee, Israel's most
prestigious media organization.
   Levy was seeking to join the group and wrote: ``As president and
publisher, I intend to become very involved in the work of the
editorial staff, with all that this implies.''
   Frenkel told the Post news staff on Wednesday that the dispute
was over ``the authority of the publisher and the authority of the
editor. ... Under these conditions, yours truly cannot be the
editor.''
   Frenkel worked for the Post for 28 years and was editor for 13
years.
   Journalists told Levy on Wednesday they were concerned about his
removal of an editorial written by Frenkel from the Post's weekly
international edition.
   The editorial defended the Post's right to criticize the
government. It was written after Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
accused the Post of harming Israel's reputation abroad by reporting
critically on Shamir's trip to the United States.
   The paper's editorial staff filed notice of a labor dispute Dec.
28 and demanded Levy's removal. The notice will allow them to take
action, including a strike or work slowdown, after a two-week
``cooling off'' period.
   Levy has said about 80 journalists still work for the newspaper.
   He was appointed president and publisher in July by David
Radler, chairman of the board of Hollinger Inc., which bought a
controlling interest in the Post in April.
   The newspaper was established in 1932 as the Palestine Post and
changed its name to the Jerusalem Post in 1950, two years after the
founding of the Jewish state.

   Planes last month bombed and harassed
rebel-held towns in southern Sudan, striking about every other day
and disrupting famine relief operations, a U.N. official said
Wednesday.
   The planes bombed seven towns 10 times during the first three
weeks of December, said the official, who spoke on condition he not
be identified.
   Those that didn't bomb the towns made low flights in an apparent
attempt at intimidation, the official said.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the aerial action.
   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, which has been
fighting Sudan's government for nearly seven years, has no planes
and has blamed Sudan's military government led by Lt. Gen. Omar
Hassan el-Bashir, who seized power in a June 30 coup.
   In October, four people were killed when warplanes bombed the
rebel-held town of Yirol, 620 miles southwest of Sudan's capital,
Khartoum.
   While none of the December bombings produced any casualties,
they disrupted medical and agricultural programs being administered
by employees of the U.N.-coordinated Operation Lifeline Sudan.
   ``They bomb from great heights and not with great accuracy, but
it makes work difficult for people who have to be prepared for
aerial attacks and scurry into bomb shelters,'' said the U.N.
official.
   The government has accused some relief workers of using
Operation Lifeline Sudan to ferry arms and supplies to rebels, and
a government committee recommended Wednesday that government
representatives supervise relief operations in southern Sudan.
   Peter Orat, the Cabinet minister of relief and displaced people,
said the government would not object if the rebels also wanted to
have representatives on relief operations.
   The report by the committee in charge of relief is expected to
be presented and endorsed by the Cabinet in the coming days.
   Following the Yirol bombing, Sudan's government in November
suspended relief flights, as well as the movement of food by rail
and barge, severely curtailing Operation Lifeline Sudan. Since
April, it had been moving food and supplies into the war-ravaged
and drought-stricken region.
   The operation, which moved nearly 100,000 tons of emergency food
to the south before the flight ban, has been credited with averting
a repeat of 1988's tragedy, when up to 250,000 southern Sudanese
died from war-exacerbated famine.
   Operation Lifeline is able to move only limited amounts of
supplies into Sudan by road from Kenya. Since the ban, it has been
unable to resupply medical teams.
   As a result, at least 70 people in Leer, about 50 miles
northwest of Yirol, have died of an insect-born disease called
kalazar because the drug used in the disease's therapy has been
halted, said the official.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Donna Rice Born Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donna Rice, the femme fatale of the 1987 Gary
Hart political debacle, has surfaced again _ this time as a
born-again Christian and doer of good deeds.
   She has, The Washington Times said in a lengthy profile in
Wednesday editions, returned to the values of her childhood and
``her friends travel in some of Washington's most conservative
circles.''
   Miss Rice, who lives with a female friend in northern Virginia,
declined to be interviewed for the Times story, the newspaper said.
   Her relationship with Hart, then the leading candidate for the
Democratic Party's presidential nomination, became fodder for a
nation of wagging tongues when the Miami Herald reported that Hart
spent much of a weekend alone in his Washington home with a young
woman.
   That woman later was identified as Miss Rice.
   The Washington Times story was illustrated with a large picture
of a smiling Miss Rice, wearing a green knit sweater and Santa
Claus hat. She carries a camera and the caption reads: ``Inside a
District (of Columbia) church, Donna Rice moves from group to
group, snapping photos of youngsters celebrating.''
   It was pictures of a different sort that added to the 1987
contretemps that sank Hart's candidacy. Those pictures were of a
smiling Donna Rice sitting on the lap of the former Colorado
senator aboard a luxury craft called Monkey Business. His wife,
Lee, was not in the picture.
   A few days after the Miami Herald story Hart said in a speech
that he had made a mistake putting himself into circumstances that
could be misconstrued.
   ``Did I do anything immoral?'' Hart asked. ``I absolutely did
not.''
   He dropped out of the presidential race five days after the
newspaper story. He later made a brief, unsuccessful foray into the
race.
   ``She's just a wonderful lady,'' a friend, Andy Messing, said
Wednesday about Miss Rice.
   He told the Times that Miss Rice, 32, ``went back to her roots
and because she did, she wound up coming out of a tailspin that
would have killed other people.''
   Miss Rice became an instant celebrity, but she spurned most
commercial offers. Her image became that as a gold-digging party
girl.
   ``Today Miss Rice lives a fairly simple and largely private
life,'' the newspaper said. ``She does not have a full-time paying
job, but friends say she keeps busy, shuttling neighborhood
children to school, grocery shopping for her host family, attending
charity events and getting involved _ quietly _ in charitable
work.''
   The newspaper said she has a boyfriend and attends Washington's
high-profile dinners and events. She experienced her religious
renewal after moving to Virginia, the Times said.
   ``Donna ... has not gone through that much of a change,'' said
Tricia Erickson, head of a McLean, Va., modeling agency and Miss
Rice's designated crisis manager in 1987, told the Times.
   ``I don't think that she `went to God,' so to speak. Donna's
always been like that. It isn't some miraculous thing,'' Ms.
Erickson said, adding that Miss Rice has done extensive charity
work.
   Later, Miss Erickson told another reporter that she wanted to
check with Miss Rice before saying more.

   Paul McCartney, Dick Clark, Miles Davis and
the late Vladimir Horowitz and Nat King Cole will receive lifetime
achievement awards at this year's Grammy Awards ceremonies.
   McCartney, Clark and Davis have agreed to appear Feb. 21 at the
Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles for the Grammy telecast, said
Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording
Artists.
   McCartney's impact on music as a songwriter and member of the
Beatles, as well as his continuing growth as a solo performer were
cited as reasons for his award.
   Davis played a crucial role in the development of jazz since the
1940s, the academy said.
   Horowitz was included because many consider him the 20th
century's greatest classical pianist, and Cole was cited as a
leading singer of the 1940s and 1950s.
   The inclusion of Clark was a surprise because he produces the
American Music Awards, which competes with the Grammys. The shows
are a month apart and many artists will appear on only one show,
fearing overexposure.
   ``We don't view these shows as competitive and when you look at
the big contribution Clark has made to the recording industry,
especially in exposing new talent, there is no question he is
deserving,'' Greene said.
   Clark will receive the Trustees Award because he is a
non-performing contributor to music. Past recipients include
inventors Thomas Edison and Robert Moog.

   The White House defended Lauro F. Cavazos as
an ``outstanding'' education secretary Wednesday and said the
Cabinet job is his ``as long as he wants it.''
   Marlin Fitzwater made the comment in response to press reports
critical of the low-keyed Cavazos.
   The Washington Post carried a front-page headline Wednesday
reading, ``Cavazos Gets Low Marks,'' and a recent Jack Anderson
column suggested the former university president and medical school
dean would be the first to exit the Bush Cabinet.
   ``We think Secretary Cavazos has done an oustanding job. He's
been a great advocate for the president's policy on choice in
education, he's traveled around the country and he meets with the
president regularly. We're very pleased with his work,'' said
Fitzwater.
   ``He has the job as long as he wants it. He's doing a great job
and it's unfair of certain public interest groups to try to
stimulate these kinds of stories, which is my judgment of how they
come about,'' said Fitzwater.
   Cavazos could not be reached for comment.
   He was scheduled to meet with Bush in the Oval Office on
Tuesday, but was called out of town and the meeting put off until
next week, the White House said.
   Cavazos, in a statement issued by his office, said: ``I serve at
the president of the president and am commited to helping George
Bush be the education president. Nothing has changed my commitment
to that goal.''
   Cavazos became education chief in September 1988 for the final
four months of the Reagan presidency and Bush kept the Texan on. He
was the first Hispanic American ever to hold a Cabinet post.
   He helped organize Bush's education summit with the governors
last September, where an agreement was reached to draw up the first
set of national performance goals for America's schools.
   Cavazos has been less outspoken and less confrontational than
his predecessor, William J. Bennett, who frequently pilloried
teacher unions, college presidents and other pillars of the
education establishment. Bennett is now Bush's drug policy
coordinator.

   Peru has reversed its decision to boycott the
upcoming Colombia drug summit in protest of the U.S. military
invasion of Panama, and will attend after all, U.S. and Peruvian
officials said Wednesday.
   It has not been decided whether President Alan Garcia will
attend the meeting with President Bush and the presidents of
Colombia and Bolivia, or whether he will send a lower ranking
official to reiterate his objection to the U.S. military action,
officials said.
   Only if Bush withdraws the troops he sent will Garcia himself go
to the Feb. 15 meeting in Cartagena, said one Peruvian diplomat,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. Garcia said two weeks ago that
he could not meet with ``the leader of an invading nation.''
   Peru does plan to participate in a Jan. 10-14 preparatory
meeting in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, where representatives of the four
countries will work on the final agenda for the summit, officials
said.
   Last week, Peru was already softening its hard line on Panama,
ending its suspension of anti-narcotics operations with U.S. agents
in the coca-rich Huallaga Valley. Officials in Lima said those
operations would be resumed because of a need to keep the anti-drug
war going.
   At the Bolivia pre-summit meeting this month, the three Andean
countries _ Peru, Bolivia and Colombia _ will meet for the first
two days and be joined by a U.S. team for the last two days.
   A goal will be to draw up a communique that Bush and the other
countries' leaders can sign at the summit in Colombia. The
communique will address cooperation and coordination in the war on
drug trafficking, the officials said.
   In addition, bilateral agreements may be reached since each of
the Andean countries has different economic circumstances and needs
different types of U.S. assistance, said John Walters, deputy to
Bush's drug policy coordinator William Bennett.
   Subjects to be discussed at the summit include law enforcement
cooperation, security assistance from the United States, trade
issues, economic assistance, and sharing of education and
intelligence about drugs, Walters said.
   One of the key points U.S. officials have been stressing is the
need for Peru and Bolivia _ the two leading producers of coca plant
for cocaine _ to involve their military forces in helping to fight
drug lords, said Michael Skol, the deputy assistant secretary of
state for South America who will lead the U.S. team to the Jan. 10
meeting. The United States is offering military training to
facilitate that aim.
   Skol said talks leading to the summit have gone well, beginning
with a trip to the three South American countries in December by
Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson and other U.S.
officials.
   ``We're pretty much in agreement on everything,'' Skol said
Wednesday, adding however, that much work needs to be done to put
down the agreement into words.
   Peru withdrew from the summit after Bush sent thousands of
troops into Panama on Dec. 20 to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
from power.
   U.S. officials have been encouraging Peru to change its mind,
and on Wednesday, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
announced that ``Peru indicates they intend to participate.''
   He said he was citing a news account that quoted Peruvian
officials, rather than official diplomatic contacts, but other U.S.
officials said they had reason to believe the report was accurate.
   Originally, the drug summit was organized by the three Andean
nations as a forum to discuss cooperation and coordination against
drug production, processing and trafficking.
   ``In no way did Peru want to boycott the meeting,'' said the
Peruvian official, adding that his government may have acted
hastily in pulling out of the summit after the Panama invasion.
   ``Sometimes you say things, and then you realize it wasn't the
proper thing to say,'' the official said.
   Peru is the world's major producer of coca leaf, while Colombia
is the leader in processing and exporting the plant for cocaine.

   Six remains returned from Indochina have been

Wednesday.
   At the request of the next of kin, one of the names was
withheld, officials said in a statement.
   The five names released included:
   Air Force Col. Woodrow H. Wilburn, born June 16, 1917, from San
Antonio, Texas.
   Air Force Lt. Col. William V. Frederick, born June 1, 1933, from
Deerfield, Ohio.

   Army Sgt. Richard A. Fitts, born Feb. 23, 1946, from Abington,
Mass.
   The remains of Wilburn, Frederick, Stolz and Koons and the
individual whose name was withheld were repatriated by the
Vietnamese, while the Fitts remains were recovered during a crash
site recovery operation in Laos, the Pentagon statement said.
   The statement said the remains of three of the servicemen will
depart Hickam Air Base in Hawaii with full military honors and
travel to Travis Air Force Base, Calif., on Thursday.
   The remains of the three others have been returned to
California, but the Pentagon declined to say which remains those

<HEAD>D'Amato Senate's Top Mail Man, Posting 16.6 Million Pieces in Six
Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., sent more mail
during a six-month period last year than any other senator _ 16.6
million pieces at a cost of $2.66 million, according to a recent
report by the secretary of the Senate.
   However, an earlier report shows D'Amato sent only 3,000 pieces
in the six previous months.
   The flurry between April 1 and Sept. 30 came as questions were
raised about D'Amato's influence at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, and as Congress was debating limits on
constituent mail.
   The House ethics committee has announced a preliminary
investigation of D'Amato's housing-related actions.
   Frank Coleman, a spokesman for D'Amato, said Wednesday that the
senator historically has done the majority of his constituent
mailing at the end of the legislative session.
   ``That's when issues develop, when they become more important,''
Coleman said.
   Subjects of the mailings included the drug bill and catastrophic
health care, both of which came toward the end of the session,
Coleman said.
   None of the mailings dealt with news reports about D'Amato's
ties to the housing scandal, although one piece covered a housing
bill D'Amato introduced with Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Coleman
said.
   Coleman said D'Amato spent considerably less per capita on
mailings in the last six months of the fiscal year _ about 15 cents
_ than some other senators. The cost varies because of the number
of constituents in each states.
   ``We weren't even among the top 10,'' Coleman said.
   During the last six months of fiscal 1989, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz,
R-Minn., sent 10.6 million pieces costing $1.6 million, or 36 cents
per constituent. Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., appointed to fill the seat
vacated by Vice President Dan Quayle, sent 13.1 million pieces for
the period, costing $1.8 million, or 32 cents per constitutent.
   Both Boschwitz and Coats are up for re-election this year;
D'Amato's term expires in 1992.
   Franking reforms passed by Congress last year limit the amount
of money that may be used for mass mailings. D'Amato's limit for
the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, for example, will be $770,000,
the Senate Rules Committee staff has estimated.

<HEAD>Snow Storm Moving From South Onto Southern Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm dumped heavy snow over higher elevations of the
Southwest on Wednesday and headed for the southern Plains, and rain
fell ahead of the storm.
   The storm produced 7 inches of snow at Flagstaff, Ariz., giving
the city at nearly 7,000 feet a total snow cover of 14 inches. The
storm also produced heavy snow in southwestern Colorado, ranging
from 7 inches at Purgatory to 13 inches at Wolf Creek Pass, the
National Weather Service said.
   Snow advisories were posted for parts of southern Colorado,
northern New Mexico, the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles, and western
Kansas.
   Strong wind accompanied the storm system Wednesday with gusts as
high as 55 mph at Guadalupe Pass in southwestern Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed ahead of the storm and
extended during the afternoon from the central Gulf Coast to
central Oklahoma. Clouds and light rain or drizzle prevailed across
the rest of the area from the central Gulf Coast to the central
high Plains.
   In the Northwest, a weak upper level weather disturbance
produced rain over western Washington state.
   The heaviest rain during the six hours up to noon CST was 0.95
of an inch at Port Arthur, Texas.
   Early Wednesday, readings dipped below zero across parts of
Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 23 degrees below
zero at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   Strong northerly wind ushered in a new blast of cold air into
the northern and central Plains and by afternoon temperatures were
still in the teens in northern North Dakota.
   But afternoon temperatures were in the 70s across southern Texas
and across Florida.
   Three more cities reported that last month was their coldest
December on record, with mean temperatures of 7.6 at Burlington,
Vt., 23.0 at Lexington, Ky., and 5.5 at St. Johnsbury, Vt., where
it also was the coldest of any month on record.

   Grain exporters said Wednesday that they have
sold another 150,000 metric tons of soybeans to the Soviet Union
and 100,000 metric tons of corn to China.
   That makes 217,900 tons of soybeans for the Soviets since Oct.
1, the opening of the new sales year under the Long Term Grain
Supply Agreement, the Agriculture Department said.
   U.S. exporters also have sold 800,000 tons of wheat, 11 million
tons of corn, 795,000 tons of soybean meal and 7,300 tons of barley
to the Soviet Union in the last three months.
   The agreement year runs through Sept. 30.
   The latest purchase by China, another big importer of U.S.
commodities, brought to 403,000 metric tons the amount of American
corn it has received.
   China also has purchased more than 5 million tons of wheat this
marketing year and is expected to buy more before the period ends
Aug. 31.
   USDA also said that exporters reported Wednesday sales of 26,000
tons of soybean oil to Pakistan, bringing that country's total
purchase of the commodity this marketing year to 50,800 tons.
   Exporters are required to report to the Agriculture Department
export sales of 100,000 metric tons or more of one commodity, made
in one day, to one destination by 3 p.m. EST on the day after the
sale.

   The Albany area, dubbed the murder capital of
the nation by the FBI for 1988, reported 24 murders last year,
fewer than the year before.
   The city of Albany had 21 murders in 1989, while unincorporated
Dougherty County had three, according to city and county police.
   An FBI report last year said that 27 murders in the southwestern
Georgia city in 1988 and two more in the county gave the area the
highest per-capita murder rate in the nation: 24.5 murders per
100,000 people, ahead of New York City's rate of 22.7.
   Local authorities disputed the figures. Albany police said the
city had only 24 murders in 1988, and Dougherty County police
reported one 1988 murder, not two.
   The statistics also spawned controversy in Albany's mayoral race
last year when challenger Tommy Coleman was quoted as saying,
``People are living in fear.''
   Incumbent Larry Bays accused Coleman of being ``irrational.''
Coleman said his statements were taken out of context, but he won
the race. He takes office Monday.
   The city already has recorded one murder this year. Police say
23-year-old Eddie Dean Mayes was killed New Year's Day during an
argument with two brothers.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attackers shot up the home of an aide to
rebellious Christian commander Michel Aoun before dawn Wednesday
and at least five people were reported killed, but the apparent
target was not injured.
   In south Lebanon, rival Shiite Moslem militias battled in the
orchards of Iqlin al-Tuffah _ the Apple Province _ for supremacy in
the predominantly Shiite region.
   Lt. Col. Adel Sassin escaped unhurt as his guards battled the
attackers in the mountain town of Beit Meri, in the Christian
enclave eight miles east of Beirut, police reported.
   It was the first such assault on a ranking aide to Aoun since
the general rebelled in November against the Syrian-backed
government of President Elias Hrawi, a fellow Christian.
   Four of those killed were soldiers guarding the Sassin
residence, said a statement from Aoun's command. It identified the
fifth person slain as Saliba Youssef, a Christian civilian whose
body was found in a pine forest near the house.
   Police said they believed Youssef was one of the attackers, but
a television station run by Aoun said he might have been an
innocent witness killed by the attackers as they fled.
   There was no claim of responsibility. Aoun's command blamed the
assault on infiltrators trying to ``create confusion'' in the
310-square-mile enclave north and east of Beirut where 1 million
Christians live.
   Police said six people were killed and 18 wounded in the south
Lebanon fighting between Hezbollah, which is loyal to Iran, and the
mainstream Amal militia supported by Syria. They said about 10,000
villagers fled the Iqlin al-Tuffah region southeast of Sidon.
   Amal's military commander for the region was found dead
Wednesday, but relatives said Hassan Jaafar, 40, was not killed in
combat. They said his throat had been cut.
   Seventy people have been reported killed and 252 wounded since
the fighting began Dec. 23.
   A Hezbollah statement said its units in the region 30 miles
south of Beirut were ordered to stop shooting Wednesday, but it did
not specify an hour. The statement said Hezbollah's leadership
decideded on a unilateral cease-fire to ``spare the blood of our
people and set the stage for a dialogue.''
   Amal would not comment on the announcement and police in Sidon
said there was no break in the fighting.
   Nabih Berri, leader of Amal, said earlier his men would observe
a truce only when Hezbollah withdrew from four strategic villages
its fighters had captured. Police said Hezbollah still held two of
the villages.
   The militia struggle for dominance among the 1.2 million
Shiites, the largest sect in Lebanon, has continued intermittently
for two years. Police say 641 people have been killed and 1,831
wounded.
   Hrawi has dismissed Aoun as army commander, but the Christian
general still has the loyalty of about 20,000 Christian troops who
control the Christian enclave.
   Aoun's forces fought a six-month artillery war last year with
Syrian troops and their Moslem allies, which ended in September
when the Arab League arranged a cease-fire.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate granted in 1976, the year after Lebanon's
sectarian civil war began. Aoun calls the Syrians an occupation
army and declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive them out.

<HEAD>Chess Champion Suggestion Provokes Strikes, Protest in Mongolia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World chess champion Garry Kasparov, no stranger
to controversy, now has an entire country protesting one of his
moves, Soviet government spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
Wednesday.
   Gerasimov told a news briefing Kasparov, ``as a fantastic
idea,'' proposed in an interview with the U.S. magazine Playboy
that Mongolia, an independent country and loyal ally of the
Soviets, be sold to China.
   It was ``an unsuccessful move by the chess king,'' Gerasimov
commented.
   Protest letters and petitions signed by thousands of Mongolians
have arrived at the Soviet Embassy in Ulan Bator, capital of
Mongolia, and four Soviet consulates, Gerasimov said.
   He said two-hour strikes were held Dec. 30 at plants in Mongolia
that make goods for the Soviet market.
   It was not clear how many people in Mongolia, located between
China and the Soviet Union, had heard of what Kasparov told the
American magazine or why they would much attention to it. Gerasimov
said Kasparov's ``fantastic ideas'' had nothing in common with
official Soviet policy.
   Kasparov's outspoken conduct, globetrotting lifestyle and
Western income have raised eyebrows in the Soviet Union.
   In 1985, he accused the international chess federation of
conspiring with the Soviet chess bureaucracy to keep him from
defeating Anatoly Karpov, another Soviet player who was world
champion at the time. Kasparov won the title.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newly elected President Vaclav
Havel visited North Moravia Wednesday and pledged not to forget the
needs of people living in heavily industrialized zones.
   North Moravia probably will be more affected than any other
region by planned economic reforms substantially limiting heavy
industry in Czechoslovakia.
   ``I ensure you that I want to keep my promises and I want to
solve your problems. ... I understand all your problems, so you
understand mine,'' Havel told a crowd in Frydek Mistek.
   Havel, once a banned playwright who spent about five years in
prison for his dissident activities, became president last month in
the culmination of the peaceful revolution that ousted the
Communist leadership.
   Czechoslovakia plans to reduce heavy industry that had been
built up by the country's former rulers in an effort to alleviate
the nation's devastating ecological problems. The country's new
leaders say so much industry is not necessary.
   Deputy Premier Valtr Komarek, who accompanied Havel, stressed
Czechoslovakia needs retraining programs as it restructures its
economy. He also said he favors small private enterprises and joint
ventures.
   Also Wednesday, a police colonel who faced charges for his
actions against pro-democracy demonstrators in Prague Nov. 17 was
found dead in his office of an apparent suicide, the state news
agency CTK said.
   Jiri Becvar's body was found early Wednesday with a gunshot
wound to the head and investigations indicated he killed himself,
the agency said.
   On Nov. 17, riot police used clubs, tear gas and dogs to
disperse hundreds of peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators in the
capital.
   The demonstrators finally won out, leading to the forced
resignations of the orthodox Communist government days later.
   In a related development, Polish TV reported that Czechoslovak
Foreign Minister Vaclav Klaus invited Solidarity Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki to Prague.
   ``We (Czechoslovakia) would be delighted if he (Mazowiecki)
would be the first head of government to visit Czechoslovakia now.
In that way, we would like to underline the special nature of
relations between our two countries,'' Klaus was quoted as saying.
   Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity editor and close adviser of Lech
Walesa, was elected the East Bloc's first non-Communist head of
government in over four decades on Aug. 24.
   No date for the visit was announced.

<TEXT>
   Soviet miners trying to form independent
unions met with AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland on Wednesday as
part of their month-long study of U.S. labor unions and mining and
safety practices.
   The nine Soviets, who are among the leaders of the strikes by
thousands of Soviet miners that began last summer, also met with
United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka and will spend most of
Thursday at UMW headquarters. Their trip will include stops in
several cities.
   Kirkland, referring to the tentative settlement reached this
week to end a bitter nine-month UMW strike against the Pittston
Coal Co., told the Soviet miners that workers trying to ``gain a
better life for their families must face and deal with powerful and
entrenched forces in every society.
   ``That is certainly true here.''
   Last week, the Soviet government revoked the passport and exit
visa of one miner who had been scheduled to make the tour, Sergei
Masalovich. In a statement, the AFL-CIO called on the Soviet
government to reverse its ``crude decision'' that the federation
said inaccurately claimed Masalovich had been relieved of his
duties by the Vorkuta Strike Committee.
   Kirkland said officials of the AFL-CIO were continuing to press
for reversal of a November refusal by the Soviet government to let
an AFL-CIO delegation visit the Soviet Union.
   The visiting miners are the guests of the AFL-CIO but the trip
is being paid for under a U.S. Information Agency exchange program.
   The Soviets are scheduled to visit mines in Virginia or West
Virginia, the Colorado School of Mines, Pittsburgh and Atlanta
labor leaders and a Texas state AFL-CIO convention.
   When Kirkland announced the Soviets' visit last month, he
compared their struggle to that of Solidarity organizers in Poland
in the early 1980s and pledged to offer the federation's support
even if it meant defying the Soviet government.
   The AFL-CIO's support of Solidarity included the smuggling of
printing and other communications equipment into Poland while
Solidarity was outlawed. In all, the federation gave about $5
million worth of equipment and other assistance to Solidarity.

   Football defeated entertainment reruns in the
Nielsen television ratings for the holiday week ended Dec. 31.
   ABC's NFL Monday Night Football game between the Cincinnati
Bengals and the Minnesota Vikings was the top show of the week in
the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey.
   NBC's prime-time runover of Sunday's AFC Wild Card game between
the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Houston Oilers drew even more
viewers, although the networks disputed whether that made it the
No. 1 show.
   The game ran 61 minutes into prime time after 7 p.m. Sunday and
was listed first in Nielsen rankings released by NBC and CBS. ABC
does not include spillover shows in its ratings, and Nielsen's own
release didn't include the runover game.
   ``My philosophy is that everything on the air after 7 p.m.
Sunday and after 8 p.m. the rest of the week should be counted,''
said Arnold Becker, CBS vice president for television research.
``Once you begin to leave things out, different people come up with
different answers.''
   The highest-rated entertainment show was a repeat of NBC's ``The
Cosby Show.'' Nearly all of the shows were reruns. ABC's ``20-20''
was the only show other than football that was original.
   CBS did not have a show in the Top 20. Its highest show was ``60
Minutes,'' which finished in a tie for 22nd place.
   NBC was first among the networks in the Nielsen survey with an
average rating of 13.4. ABC regained second place with 11.4 and
CBS, after two weeks in second place, was third with 10.3. The
ratings represent the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million
households tuned to a show.
   It was the 11th consecutive victory for NBC, which leads for the
season with 14.7. ABC is second with 13.0 and CBS third with 12.1.
   Here's the Top 10 according to Nielsen's release: ABC's NFL
Monday Night Football Game between Cincinnati and Minnesota, NBC's
``The Cosby Show,'' NBC's ``The Golden Girls'' and ``Cheers'' tied,
NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' ABC's ``Roseanne,'' and NBC's ``Empty
Nest,'' ``A Different World,'' ``Dear John'' and ``Matlock.''
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was a decisive winner among the
evening news shows with a rating of 11.4. NBC moved into second
place with 10.3 and CBS was third with 10.2
   ABC was first every week of the fourth quarter, including two
ties with CBS. The final months of the year produced some of the
biggest stories of the year, including the Bay Area earthquake, the
fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Communist governments
across Eastern Europe, the revolution in Romania and the invasion
of Panama. The ABC show was also the highest-rated news program for
1989.
   The lowest-rated show of the three major networks was ABC's
``Life Goes On.'' Here are the five bottom network shows: ABC's
``Mr. Belvedere,'' ABC's ``Free Spirit,'' CBS' ``Tour of Duty,''
ABC's ``Living Dolls'' and ABC's ``Life Goes On.''

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev summoned the entire
19-member bureau of Lithuania's breakaway Communist Party to Moscow
Wednesday for talks expected to focus on attempts at
reconciliation, Lithuanian activists said.
   The Soviet Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee
directed Gorbachev and other top party officials on Dec. 26 to
travel to Lithuania to try to heal an unprecedented break in party
unity caused by the Lithuanians' decision six days earlier to
create an independent Communist Party.
   Informed Moscow sources said Gorbachev might visit Lithuania
starting next Monday, though there has been no official
announcement.
   In Vilnius, capital of the Soviet Baltic republic, activists of
the grassroots pro-democracy group Sajudis predicted Gorbachev
wanted to meet with Lithuanian party leaders beforehand to ask them
to suspend their action until the Communist Party's role in society
can be redefined.
   Vida Laumenskaite, a secretary at Sajudis headquarters in
Vilnius, said Lithuanian party leader Algirdas Brazauskas and the
other 18 members of the ruling party bureau flew to Moscow
Wednesday at Gorbachev's invitation. Moscow-based official media
carried no immediate news of the trip, which Ms. Laumenskaite said
was organized quickly.
   She said there were rumors in Vilnius that Gorbachev would ask
the Lithuanians to suspend their action until a national Communist
Party congress can be held in October.
   The congress is expected to redefine the party's role in Soviet
society in line with Gorbachev's calls for the party to get out of
managing day-to-day affairs and become more of an ideological force.
   Faced with the Lithuanian break, some dissenting Communists in
the republic formed an alternate Central Committee that proclaims
loyalty to Moscow and the Soviet Communist Party that Gorbachev
heads.

   President Bush presented a small American flag
Wednesday to the leader of a U.S., Soviet and Chinese climbing team
that hopes to mark Earth Day 1990 by standing on the top of Mount
Everest and clean up debris left by previous expeditions to the top
of the world's highest peak.
   Bush handed the flag to Jim Whittaker, the first American to
climb Mount Everest, after signing a proclamation declaring April
22 as Earth Day and calling on the ``American people to rededicate
themselves _ in their practices as consumers and citizens _ to
protecting the environment.''
   The first Earth Day was held in 1970 to call attention to
environmental problems and Bush said during a brief White House
ceremony this year's version will ``give us an opportunity to
reflect on the past 20 years and set the agenda for the next
decade.''
   Bush has pledged during his presidential campaign to be a leader
in protecting the environment but has already had a string of
run-ins with national environmental groups.
   Whittaker, a Port Townsend, Wash., resident, said in an
interview after the ceremony that the Everest expedition will
``show through friendship and cooperation that high goals can be
reached.''
   The 30-person team represents the first time that climbers from
the three countries have been involved in a joint expedition and
Whittaker said that weather permiting, they hope to actually reach
the summit on April 22.
   ``The symbolism is really important,'' Whittaker said. ``I
believe that in the 1990s the environment will be the primary
concern of the citizens of the world. I would like to see millions
on people on Earth Day doing something for Mother Earth.''
   Whittaker said that over the years previous expeditions to the
summit of the 29,028-foot mountain have left behind oxygen bottles,
tents and other debris.
   ``I climbed it in 1963 and we left garbage,'' Whittaker said.
``But the ethic was different then. It was in the 1970s that we
gained an environmental ethic and now we would like to return the
summit of Mount Everest to a pristine condition.''
   Climbers will haul the debris off the summit and other camps on
the mountain in duffel bags and than yaks will be used to cart the
garbage to roadheads, Whittaker said.
   Whittaker said the flag presented by Bush would be carried to
the summit, but he needed to ``make sure that the Chinese and
Soviet flags were the same size.''

<HEAD>Administration Deplores Killing of Nuns</HEAD>

   The Bush administration Wednesday deplored the
killing of two nuns in Nicaragua, but said the Sandinista
government had failed to support an allegation that U.S.-backed
Contra rebels were to blame.
   The White House said it did not know who ambushed the church
workers Monday night on a highway in a remote northeast section of
the country.
   Two Roman Catholic nuns _ one American, the other Nicaraguan _
were killed. A third nun and an American-born Nicaraguan bishop
were wounded.
   ``We deplore in the strongest terms this outrageous attack on
religious workers and extend our deepest sympathy to the families
of the victims,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters.
   ``This is a tragic incident, one that further underscores the
need to bring peace, stability and democracy to Nicaragua.''
   He said that neither the U.S. government nor church officials
know who was responsible for the attack. Contra commanders have
denied involvement, he said.
   ``The Nicaraguan government has provided no information to
substantiate its charge that the Contras launched the attack, and
we hope the Sandinistas do not seek to obscure this tragedy by
engaging in a propaganda battle,'' Fitzwater said.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., long a critic of U.S. policy in
Central America, said that while it was not known who carried out
the attack, it ``was not an isolated incident,'' and much of the
continuing violence in Nicaragua ``can be blamed squarely and
unambiguously on the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.''
   ``At the very least, I hope that this assault will awaken the
administration to honor the peace process and the time-table for
Contra demobilization _ steps that will reverse the cycle of
violence in Nicaragua,'' Dodd said.
   The United States stopped providing military aid to the Contras
in February 1988. The Contras were to have begun disbanding
voluntarily under the terms of a peace pact agreed to by Central
American leaders.
   But the rebels, operating primarily out of bases in Honduras,
have not laid down their arms, and the Nicaraguan government
recently broke off a cease-fire with the rebels. Elections are
scheduled next month, the first since the Sandinistas toppled
right-wing dictator Anastasio Somoza and came to power in 1979.
   The killings of the church workers in Nicaragua came less than
two months after the murders of six Jesuit priests at a university
in El Salvador.
   The Jesuits, their housekeeper and her daughter were killed Nov.
16, a few days after leftist rebels launched an offensive against
the government of Alfredo Cristiani. The Jesuits had been viewed by
the right-wing in El Salvador as intellectual allies of the Marxist
guerrillas.
   The U.S. government has vehemently denied that it coerced an El
Salvadoran woman who allegedly witnessed men in uniform entering
the Jesuits' residence into changing her story after being brought
to Florida for questioning.
   ``We condemn the attack, whoever did it,'' State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said about the killings in Nicaragua.
``Our embassy in Tegucigalpa (Honduras) has been in contact with
commanders of the resistance and the Yatama who have denied that
their forces were involved in the attack.''
   The Yatama is a group of Miskito Indians allied with the Contras.
   Even before the latest killings, U.S. church officials had been
seeking a meeting with President Bush to discuss what they fear may
be an anti-clerical campaign in Central America.

   A late change in the amount of wages subject
to the Social Security payroll tax this year is confusing some
employers who received notices containing outdated information,
government officials said Wednesday.
   The Social Security Administration in October announced that
earnings up to $50,400 would be subject to the payroll tax in 1990,
up from the $48,000 cutoff in 1989. But in November, Congress
enacted a deficit-reduction bill that increased the figure to
$51,300 for 1990.
   Steve Pyrek, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, said
the annual tax guide sent to employers late last year said the
``wage base'' would be $50,400. A notice that the figure has been
increased to $51,300 will go out in a mailing later this month
listing tax law changes, he said.
   Earnings above the wage base are exempt from Social Security
taxes.
   ``There's been confusion because people are getting publications
... and various IRS documents that have what was correct
information that's now incorrect,'' Pyrek said.
   Social Security Administration spokesman Frank Battistelli said
his agency plans a special mailing this month to 400 business and
trade groups publicizing the change in the 1990 figure.
   The wage base has gone up every year since 1971, with the latest
increase affecting about 10.4 million workers and self-employed
individuals who have annual earnings over last year's maximum of
$48,000.
   Increases in the taxable wage base are tied to the increase in
average annual wages. The upward revision in the 1990 wage base
occurred when Congress decided to include deferred compensation,
such as earnings set aside in 401(k) retirement accounts, in the
formula used to calculate the total amount of wages in the economy
that are subject to the Social Security tax.
   Adding deferred compensation to the calculation resulted in a
bigger-than-expected increase in average annual wages.
   The Social Security tax rate, which applies to both employer and
employee, was 7.51 percent in 1989 and rises to 7.65 percent this
year.
   The rise in the wage base does not affect the tax paid by people
earning less. They will pay more social security taxes this year
simply because of the increase in the tax rate. For example,
someone earning $30,000 in both 1989 and 1990 will see Social
Security taxes increase by about $42 a year or 81 cents a week. The
employer's tax payment increases by an equal amount.
   The combined effects of the increased tax rate and the higher
taxable wage base mean the maximum amount of Social Security taxes
deducted will jump by $320, $6.15 a week, to $3,924 for someone who
earns $51,300 or more.

   A South African citizen pleaded guilty
Wednesday to conspiring to illegally export to his country
sensitive military equipment manufactured in the United States.
   Symone N. Behrmann, 32, entered a guilty plea before U.S.
District Court Judge Joyce Green, who will sentence him April 20 on
two felony charges, which carry maximum penalties of 15 years in
prison and more than $1 million in fines.
   Behrmann admitted that he conspired to ship to South Africa
through Israel 38 gyroscopes manufactured by Northrop Corp.
   The goal of the conspiracy, according to an indictment handed up
Nov. 16, was to sell $50 million in gyroscopes to South Africa for
use in anti-tank missiles.
   As part of an effort to encourage an end to apartheid, Congress
in 1986 prohibited the export to South Africa of sensitive military
equipment.
   Behrmann also admitted that he had attempted to export defense
articles to South Africa without first obtaining a license from the
State Department in violation of the Arms Export Control Act.
   In exchange for his guilty plea, the government agreed to the
dismissal of two other criminal charges against Behrmann, including
an allegation of money laundering in connection with the
gyroscopes, which never left the United States.
   Behrmann, who had been living in Toronto until his arrest in
November, was indicted with four other people as part of an
undercover operation run by the U.S. Customs Service. Customs
agents posing as international arms brokers set up an undercover
company in Washington and tape-recorded their meetings with some of
the defendants.
   Also charged in the case are Frank J. Randazzo, 32; Maryanne E.
Callaghan, 39; Guy Perfezou and Lester George Buckingham Talbot.
   Callaghan, of Warwick, R.I., and Randazzo, a Washington area
businessman, were arrested. Perfezou and Talbot are South African
residents and are not in U.S. custody.

<TEXT>
   At least 61 barges that broke loose on the
Monongahela River, including one that spilled 10,000 gallons of
gasoline, were believed to have been improperly secured and the
mooring operators could be fined, a Coast Guard official said.
   ``They are presumed to be negligent because you don't expect a
barge that's fixed to the shore to break away on its own,'' Coast
Guard Cmdr. Tony Regalbuto said Wednesday.
   The operators of mooring areas in a 58-mile stretch of rain and
snow-swollen river could be fined up to $1,000 per vessel because
of the New Year's Day incidents, Regalbuto said. On Dec. 26, the
Coast Guard had warned operators a thaw was expected by the weekend.
   ``They knew this was coming,'' said Paul Behers, spokesman for
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources.
   But two mooring operators said they felt they had taken adequate
precautions.
   The 10,000-gallon spill from one of the runaway barges caused
only slight environmental damage, officials said. Another barge
holding 420,000 gallons of fuel was pried Tuesday from the Maxwell
Dam, 61 miles upstream from Pittsburgh. Its cargo was intact.
   At least 30 of the barges sank, prompting the Coast Guard to
halt river traffic along a 20-mile stretch south of Pittsburgh.
Some of the submerged vessels were empty; others carried coal. The
river was expected to reopen as soon as all the sunken barges were
located, possibly Thursday, the Coast Guard said.
   Late Wednesday afternoon, the Coast Guard began searching for
sunken barges in the closed section of the river with sonar
equipment from the Army Corps of Engineers in Louisville, Ky. The
procedure was expected to last at least until midnight.
   The gasoline that spilled was on a barge that was ripped from
Mon River Towing Inc.'s dock at Speers, 44 miles upstream from
Pittsburgh. The vessel went over the locks and dam at Charleroi,
then hit the Monongahela Bridge before coming to rest at New Eagle,
14 miles farther downstream.
   The spilled gasoline drifted down the Ohio River to Ohio and
West Virginia on Wednesday, becoming more diluted with every mile.
   ``The farther it goes, the less pronounced it would be,'' Behers
said.
   Four other barges broke loose from Mon River Towing, including
the one hauling 420,000 gallons of diesel fuel and gasoline.
   James Guttman, Mon River Towing president, said his company was
investigating ``whether or not there is anything more we could have
done.''
   ``We feel they were adequately moored for the conditions that we
were having prior to the breakaway,'' Guttman said.
   LTV spokeswoman Debbie Kavulich said her company took the
necessary precautions prior to New Year's Day at the company's
mooring facility three miles upstream from Pittsburgh, where 15 of
the wayward barges came from.
   ``Apparently, the river had such a strong force and the ice was
so thick ... when this force came through, the barges broke
loose,'' she said. ``It's just one of those things with Mother
Nature. I can't explain it.''

   Julio Gallo, 79-year-old co-owner of the
world's largest winery and one of the wealthiest men in America,
was in stable condition Wednesday after a highway collision that
killed a woman in the other car.
   Gallo and his 74-year-old wife, Eileen, were injured Tuesday as
their car crossed the center line and struck another on the
perilous, winding Pacheco Pass Highway about 80 miles south of San
Francisco, the California Highway Patrol said.
   Investigating officer Tom Melden said an early probe of the
wreck indicated Mrs. Gallo was driving and that the accident was
her fault, but no charges were immediately filed. Alcohol did not
appear to be a factor, he said.
   Gallo is president of the $1 billion-a-year, privately owned E&amp;J
Gallo Winery of Modesto; his brother, Ernest, is its chairman.
   The accident killed 27-year-old Sharon Kauk of San Jose, the
Santa Clara County coroner's office reported. Her husband, Timothy,
and 3-month-old son, Matthew, were airlifted to a Santa Clara
Valley Medical Center.
   Kauk was listed in stable condition Wednesday with minor
injuries, which weren't disclosed, said Medical Center spokesman
George Pavicich. Matthew, who had been in a seat restraint, was in
serious condition with undetermined injuries, he said. The child
had earlier been reported unhurt.
   The Gallos were admitted to San Jose Medical Center. He was
listed in stable condition Wednesday, upgraded from guarded
condition, and she was under observation and being treated for a
hand injury.
   Last October, Forbes magazine listed Julio Gallo as the nation's
283 richest man.
   In 1933, with $5,900 of pooled money, he and his brother started
making wine with a library recipe. Today, with Julio as master
winemaker and Ernest as the marketing chief, E&amp;J Gallo bottles some
250,000 cases of wine a day and sells nearly 27 percent of the wine
in the United States. Sixteen brands carry their logo.
   Gallo spokesman Dan Solomon said Ernest Gallo had been informed
of the accident but had no comment.

   Thousands of Bulgarians demonstrated
Wednesday against a government decision to give ethnic Turks the
right to use their Moslem names and reverse other discriminatory
policies, an official report said.
   The state BTA news agency said the demonstrators in five cities
``demanded the decision be reconsidered.''
   The demonstrations were in Plovdiv, Turgovishte, Shoumen,
Roussse and Smolyan, BTA said.
   But citizens at another rally, in Varna, supported the
government's decision and criticized ``the inflamed passions of
some unreasonable Bulgarians,'' it said.
   The news agency did not say how many people participated in the
Varna rally. It said ``thousands'' demonstrated in the other cities.
   The government's new policy, adopted Dec. 29, allows members of
the 1 million-strong ethnic Turkish minority to use their original
Moslem names. It also grants the ethnic Turks freedom to choose
their religion and schools without restrictions.
   According to an assimilation policy adopted under ousted
hard-line leader Todor Zhivkov, the ethnic Turks were forced to
change their names to Bulgarian ones.
   Petar Mladenov, who took over from Zhivkov as Communist Party
leader and president on Nov. 10, has promised reforms and free
elections next year.
   Plovdiv is about 93 miles southeast of Sofia, Turgovishte 186
miles northeast of the capital, Shoumen 215 miles northeast, Rousse
180 miles east, and Smolyan 125 miles southeast of Sofia.
   Varna is on the Black Sea coast.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health officials Wednesday launched a program to
reduce the state's high rate of underweight newborns by encouraging
and helping pregnant women who do not see doctors to get prenatal
care.
   The program, Better Beginnings, will be coordinated through the
city-owned Denver General Hospital, where the rate of low
birth-weight babies is nearly twice the national average.
   Colarado ranks eighth in the nation in the rate of newborns
weighing less than 5{ pounds, behind six southern states and the
District of Columbia.
   Better Beginnings will target women who do not see a doctor
during their pregnancy, said program spokeswoman Cleo
Parker-Robinson.
   ``I'm ... amazed by the delicacy of life, especially the
critical months between conception and birth,'' she said. ``There
are so many dangers.''
   Of the infants born at Denver General, 12.3 percent are
underweight compared to the national average of 6.8 percent,
officials said. The percentage is also significantly higher than
the Denver County rate of 9.7 percent.
   The problem is most severe among newborns whose mothers either
received no prenatal care, or who first saw a doctor late in their
pregnancies. Denver General officials said 22 percent of the
deliveries at the hospital are to women in those categories.
   Such babies are at much higher risk of incurring serious health
problems requiring extended hospitalization at birth; they have a
higher chance for lifelong physical handicaps; and they have a
higher death rate.
   ``We still have many pregnant women whose first contact with a
physician is on the day they show up at a delivery room,'' said
Terri Bailey, director of the Perinatal Project at Denver General.
   In 1988, Denver General delivered 183 babies to women who had
not been seen by a doctor even once during their pregnancies.
   ``A lack of prenatal care correlates strongly with babies who
are born too early, or born weighing less than 5.5 pounds,'' she
said. Such babies are 40 times more likely to die during their
first year, or to experience serious long-term physical and
developmental problems.''
   Better Beginnings will use counselors to contact expectant women
who normally would not seek out prenatal care and put them in touch
with doctors at Denver-area clinics. As part of this effort,
brochures printed in Spanish and English will be circulated.
   The program will provide medical care, help in seeking financial
assistance through existing programs, nutrition counseling,
follow-up counselors to encourage pregnant women to see doctors
regularly, counseling for any drug or alcohol abuse problems, and a
combination outreach-education effort to increase public awareness.

   East German leaders joined tens of thousands
of people at the Soviet war memorial Wednesday night in a protest
of neo-Nazism, the official news agency ADN reported.
   It said the demonstrators included Gregor Gysi, the new
Communist Party chief; President Manfred Gerlach and other
government leaders; and Vyacheslav Kotchemassov, Soviet ambassador
to East Germany.
   Last week, vandals painted Nazi slogans on the memorial to
Soviet soldiers killed in Berlin in World War II. The memorial is
in the Treptow district of East Berlin.
   ADN initially said ``tens of thousands'' attended the
demonstration Wednesday in Treplow, which the Communist Party
sponsored. It later estimated the crowd at more than 250,000
people, but a witness who has seen other large demonstrations in
East Germany said that was an exaggeration.
   East Germany plans its first free elections in May and the
Communist Party admits it may have difficulty remaining in the
government. Observers feel the party may use the neo-Nazi issue in
an attempt to build support and discourage sentiment for
reunification with West Germany.
   The news agency quoted Gysi as saying at the demonstration:
``This country was born from anti-fascists. Don't let it become the
homeland for neo-fascists.''
   He said democratic reforms were occurring in East Germany only
because of change promoted in the Soviet Union by President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, and ``therefore, we cannot tolerate any form of
anti-Sovietism. Our land is in danger, and it comes from the
right.''
   ZDF television of West Germany showed pictures of the
demonstrators, some of whom chanted ``Nazis out! No Third Reich!''
in reference to the Hitler era of 1933-45.
   Banners carried by the crowd read ``We Say No to Reunification _
and No to the Brown Pest,'' a reference to Hitler's brown-shirted
Storm Troopers.
   ADN said representatives of dozens of pro-democracy groups
attended the demonstration.
   Its report said neo-Nazi ``skinheads and so-called Nazi punks
have contact with rightist radicals in West Germany.''
   Police investigations revealed that neo-Nazis in East Germany
sympathized with the ultra-rightist Reupblican Party, which has
pressed for an end to political asylum for foreigners in West
Germany and restrictions on the admission of foreign workers, ADN
said.
   Neo-Nazis want a united Germany with the 1939 borders, outside
NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the agency report said.
   Vandals defaced monuments and public buildings in several East
German cities over the New Year holiday with ``shameful slogans
such as `Jews Out' or `Foreigners Out,' and `Communists Against the
Wall','' ADN said.
   Heinz Galinski, leader of the Jewish community in West Germany,
said in a statement Wednesday he was ``shocked by the increasing
reports of neo-Nazi activity in East Germany.''
   ``There is not the least doubt that there is a close connection
with rightist radicals in West Germany,'' Galinski said, and urged
East German government leaders to ``take energetic steps against
the neo-Nazi activity.''

<TEXT>
   Health food addicts take note: President Bush
has found a new way to eat oat bran.
   With Butterfingers candy bars.
   The president was observed whipping up just such a dish in a
health club restaurant last Saturday in Houston, where he spent the
New Year's holiday weekend.
   His unusual concoction _ mixing a chocolate-covered bar with oat
bran, all the rage because of its reputed ability to lower
cholesterol _ caught the eye of a college student also in line at
the Houstonian's Center Court restaurant.
   ``He said, `Oh, nobody will notice,'' University of Texas at
Austin student Julie Miller told the Houston Post.
   The Post's account on Sunday sparked further press reports of
Bush's latest culinary improvisation, including one in The New York
Times that began: ``Do you want to hear something really disgusting
about the president of the United States?''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked Wednesday about
Bush's Butterfingers-oat bran treat, said, ``He had not done that
before, but liked it so much, he vows to try it again.''
   ``It kind of came about by accident, I'm told. But it tasted so
good, we may make this a staple in the White House mess,'' added
Fitzwater, who lost 30 pounds on a recent diet.
   Bush has a reputation as a hearty eater, with a special fondness
for taco salads and porkrinds. He has also been seen spicing up
tunafish sandwiches with hot pepper sauce.
   Bush's cholesterol level was 192 _ ``desireable,'' by the
American Heart Association's estimation _ according to figures from
a 1988 check-up released when he was vice president.

   White House adviser William Roper was named
Wednesday as director of the federal Centers for Disease Control
and was applauded by the head of the National Commission on AIDS as
being ``wonderfully well trained for what's coming in public
health.''
   Roper will leave his desk at the White House on March 1 to
become director of the Atlanta-based CDC, the federal government's
lead agency in fighting epidemics, tracking disease and monitoring
public health.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said Roper's
experience advising Presidents Reagan and Bush on health policy
issues and as administrator for the Medicare and Medicaid programs
makes him well suited for the job.
   ``Dr. Roper is the strongest possible candidate for one of the
toughest and most important jobs in the federal government,''
Sullivan said in formally announcing Roper's selection Wednesday.
   His appointment was also hailed by Dr. June Osborn, dean of the
University of Michigan School of Public Health and head of the AIDS
commission, who said Roper is ``wonderfully well trained for what's
coming in public health.''
   She said Roper's academic training as a physician and in public
health combined with his government experience and ``deep knowledge
of the strengths and weaknesses of the health care system'' make
him well suited for his new job.
   Also applauding the appointment of the 41-year-old pediatrician
was Mervyn Silverman, president of the American Federation for AIDS
Research, who described Roper as ``a very fine person,'' and said,
``this could be a very important new appointment as far as the
fight against AIDS is concerned.''
   ``Dr. Roper is a physician first, and I'm really hopeful he will
place the medical and public health needs before the political
needs,'' he added.
   At the CDC, Roper will direct an agency with 5,000 employees and
a budget that has grown over the last nine years with the AIDS
epidemic to $1.1 billion this fiscal year. About $450 million of
that is dedicated to tracking the AIDS epidemic and disseminating
information on preventing the disease, which is spread chiefly
through sexual contact and the sharing of needles by drug users.
   Roper declined to discuss specific issues facing CDC or his
goals until he visits with officials there and studies the issues.
   Before coming to Washington, Roper was health officer of the
Jefferson County Department of Health in Birmingham, Ala. Besides
his medical degree, he holds a master's degree in public health.

   American Catholics are sending $10,000 in
emergency assistance to augment the Panamanian church's efforts to
aid the country's rebuilding following the recent U.S. military
action, the Catholic Relief Services said Wednesday.
   The contribution, to be delivered Thursday to Archbishop Marcos
G. McGrath, is ``demonstration of solidarity with the Panamanian
church in time of need'' according to a statement released by CRS.
   Despite increasing aid from other U.S. sources, ``the need is
great and getting help to the poor is our concern,'' said Lawrence
A. Pezzullo, executive director.
   CRS and its efforts are not connected with programs of ``Aid to
Panama,'' another relief organization, as was previously reported
by The Associated Press, according to spokeswoman Karen Donovan.
   The $10,000, part of a coordinated relief effort administered by
Archdiocesan Caritas from Panama City, will be used to provide
funds for small-scale development projects, the statement said.
   CRS also has allocated $40,000 for other projects such as loans
for merchants.
   Checks and other contributions should be made to: Catholic
Relief Services, 209 W. Fayette St., Baltimore, Md. 21202-3403.

<HEAD>Hopes Dim for 11 Americans, Three Mexicans in Yacht Tragedy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GUAYMAS, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hopes dimmed Wednesday for 11 U.S. divers
missing since their boat sank on New Year's Day in the Gulf of
California, and one survivor was quoted as saying the chartered
boat was top-heavy.
   Three Mexican crewmen also are missing since Monday's sinking of
the Santa Barbara, a refitted shrimp boat on a scuba-diving
vacation expedition. One American and one Mexican have been found
by rescuers since the boat sank about 3:30 a.m. Monday.
   Ophram Watson, 62, of Tucson, Ariz., was quoted as saying he
clinged to a door for 38 hours and survived in part because his bag
of gear popped to the surface and he managed to don his diving
suit, boots and hood. He said others with him remained in their
pajamas and eventually drifted away.
   The U.S. Coast Guard said in a news release that the wet suit
``probably assisted in his survival'' in the cold water.
   ``I was saved thanks to a door I floated on,'' Watson was quoted
as telling the Hermosillo, Mexico, newspaper El Imparcial in an
interview. ``I remember that at 6 in the morning on Monday I
couldn't recognize anyone.''
   Russ Vanderbilt, house-sitting for Watson, told the Tucson
Citizen newspaper that Watson told him before he left ``that the
boat was a remodeled shrimp boat that was top-heavy.''
   ``He said he had been on it several times,'' Vanderbilt said.
Watson told Vanderbilt the boat rocked so much from side to side
that when he looked out his window he either could see the sky
above him or the sea underneath him.
   The 68-foot Santa Barbara was used by Cortez Sea Sports of
nearby San Carlos to take tourists out to the sea and to nearby
islands, but was owned by Lane Larson of Caiman Expeditions, the
Citizen said.
   The excursion had been booked by Silent Experience Scubacenter,
owned by Wanda Larson, the newspaper said. Caiman and Silent
Experience are Tucson companies. Guaymas is a popular sea resort
270 miles south of Tucson and 875 miles northwest of Mexico City.
   A woman who identified herself as Wanda Larson's mother said the
boat had been ``fully inspected less than a month ago. There was no
problem with safety whatsoever. Mexican officials said it was a
15-foot rogue wave, an act of God.''
   The woman, reached by telephone from Mexico City, refused to
give her name but said she sometimes worked at Silent Experience.
   There is no number listed in San Carlos for Cortez Sea Sports.
   A Coast Guard news release said the Santa Barbara sailed from
Guaymas Dec. 28 for Tortuga Island, about 60 miles southwest of
Guaymas, and was due back Monday afternoon.
   Guaymas Port Capt. Joaquin Dorantes said eight Mexican navy
boats were combing a 40-mile stretch between Tortugas Island and
San Carlos for survivors and were joined by two private planes, one
American and one Mexican.
   The Coast Guard said it was helping out with Falcon H-25 and
C-130 planes out of California.
   Watson and a Mexican crewman, Vicente Gonzalez Mancilla, were
picked up separately Tuesday afternoon and and brought to San
Carlos, Mexican Navy spokesman Jose Luis Uribe said.
   Dorantes said few if any could survive more than 40 hours in the
gulf waters at temperatures of 61 to 68 degrees.
   Dorantes tentatively identified the missing Americans from a
sailing manifest as Matt Canestra, 21; Page Holmsby, 19; Tom
Malloy, 43; Norm Malloy, 42; Joe Ream, 46; Jane Ream, 45; Jerry
Lyons, 38; Verne Spiole, 43; Carol Uselachor, 36; Gerg Totd, 28;
Jim Dion, 30.
   The spellings could not be confirmed, and he said he did not
have their hometowns or other details.

   The Italian government said Wednesday that scores of
adoption cases involving Romanian children had been resolved and a
special plane would fly Italian couples to the East bloc country
this weekend to pick up their new children.
   A communique from the Foreign Ministry in Rome said the new
Romanian government had lifted a freeze on the adoptions of 130
children by Italians.
   In 1987, the hard-line Communist government of President Nicolae
Ceausescu froze adoptions by foreign citizens, who had been paying
thousands of dollars in fees and more in secret to get a child.
   The Foreign Ministry said special flights would bring the 110
sets of adoptive parents to Romania to pick up the children.
   The first DC-9 is scheduled to carry 50 Italians to Bucharest
this weekend to complete the adoption formalities and bring 33
children back to Italy, the ministry said.
   Ceausescu and his wife Elena were executed Dec. 25 after a
bloody popular revolt. Under Ceausescu's rule, birth control,
abortions and family planning information were not permitted for
women with fewer than five children.
   The Italian communique said the former regime's policies on
adoption were ``not very humanitarian'' and expressed ``great
satisfaction'' with the actions of the new government.

   Psychiatrists are struggling to cope
with the madness of Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania, with the fear and
anguish of repression and the emotional trauma of revolution.
   Doctors said Wednesday that emergency patients at Bucharest's
largest mental hospital include hundreds broken by the stress of
the fighting and upheaval.
   The wards already were filled with many others whose tortured
minds, the doctors said, must be blamed on the Communist dictator
executed Dec. 25.
   Patients at the Dr. G. Marinescu Hospital have also included
captured members of the Securitate, Ceausescu's dreaded special
police who enforced his 24 years of increasingly repressive rule.
   The emergency cases for the present are mostly people who have
snapped under the stress of the revolution, the fighting and the
sleepless nights.
   ``The majority are paranoid, psychotic. They believe they are
being followed. They are suffering from great anxiety and have an
irrational fear of death,'' said Professor Vasile Predescu, a
leading psychiatrists.
   ``They have periods of six, eight, 12 hours of intense
restlessness based on anxiety,'' Predescu said.
   There have been 200 such emergency cases of severe stress in the
last 10 days, a number he said was roughly equivalent to the number
of people admitted with such a condition in a year.
   ``The vast majority of these patients had no personal or family
history of mental illness,'' Predescu said. All of these patients
are severely disturbed and not people in need only of some
counseling to help them through troubled times. However, the
doctors said the symptoms subside to some degree after 24 to 48
hours of treatment with strong sedatives.
   ``The vast number accuse Ceausescu,'' he added. ``Some still do
not believe he is dead.''
   ``But we do,'' added Dr. Marie-Jean Georgescu in a voice filled
with contempt.
   Ceausescu's repression _ reaching far into such private spheres
as how many children a family could have, where they lived, or what
they might have to eat or read _ caused many of the psychiatric
disorders treated in this 14-ward hospital that admits 30,000
patients a year, said Dr. Lucian Alexandrescu.
   ``There have also been many suicides around Bucharest because
their homes were destroyed,'' said Predescu, referring to
Ceausescu's policy of knocking down thousands of old Bucharest
homes to make way for his grandiose Palace of the People in the
center, or clearing whole villages in the name of modernity.
   ``Many people became severely despondent just thinking that
their house or their village was about to be destroyed,'' he added.
   Alexandrescu said other patients could not cope with the
pressures and stress of daily life under Ceausescu's regime.
   ``Women had to work. They had to have children whether they
wanted them or not. It was difficult just finding food, feeding the
family,'' he said.
   ``They suffered from the impossibility of living normally,'' Ms.
Georgescu added.
   Predescu said the patients at the hospital briefly included
three Securitate agents brought there by the army under heavy guard.
   ``The terrorists exhibited a clinical picture of rapid changes
from minute to minute. They were in an intense delusional state.
They would say everyone in their family had been shot. Then they
would not know where they were. Then they would deny their family
had been shot,'' he said.
   Alexandrescu said it was unclear if these Securitate men
referred to the widespread rumors that many of them were orphans,
or were taken from their parents and trained from childhood to
serve Ceausescu.
   ``When they say they have no families, it could be true, or they
could be protecting their families,'' he said. They were later
moved to the hospital at Jilava prison, which used to house
Ceausescu's political prisoners.
   Alexandrescu said that in a couple of weeks the hospital will
begin to see the leading edge of a wave of people left severely
despondent by grief over the victims of the revolution. He said
such depression takes time to build.
   ``Now is the calm after the storm,'' he said. ``Then there will
be a wave of depressive reactions.''
   ``We have the experience of the earthquake of 1977 when
depressive reactions continued for up to six months after the
quake,'' he said, referring to the devastating quakes that killed
1,900 Bucharest residents.
   Dr. Constantin Dincea said many people grieving over lost loved
ones find comfort and solidarity with others suffering from a
similar loss.
   ``One of my colleagues lost her husband. He was shot. Her grief
dissolved at the funeral when she met all the other people who at
the same moment were burying their dead,'' he said. ``They gave
each other mutual support. It was extraordinary, compassionate
human solidarity.''
   Dincea, who specializes in child psychology, said the children
have fared better in the emotional upheaval of the revolution.
   ``Children seem better equipped emotionally to deal with it,''
he said. ``They do not have a sense of the correct meaning of
death.''
   The four doctors all believed that the end of Ceausescu will
mean fewer patients, a gradual return to mental health for a nation
caught in the web of madness.
   They also said the end of the Ceausescu years will also enable
Romania's 9,100 psychiatrists to be better prepared to deal with
mental illness.
   Ceausescu interfered, they said, with the free exchange of
information with psychiatrists abroad. He refused to allow
foreigners to take part in conferences in Romania or to permit
Romanian psychiatrists to travel abroad.
   Alexandrescu complained that Romania's reputation in the field,
as in many others, suffered in recent years because Ceausescu made
it so difficult even for them to publish papers abroad.
   ``It was awful, awful,'' he said. ``You could get sick just
trying to do this. A successful applicant would make a good
candidate for hospitalization here.''

<HEAD>British Detective Arrives to Investigate Murder of British Woman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Scotland Yard investigator traveled
to the Masai Mara game reserve Wednesday to look into the 1988
murder of a 28-year-old British woman, according to Britain's High
Commission.
   Ken Thompson, a chief superintendent for the British criminal
investigative body, arrived Tuesday and immediately began talks
with Kenyan police on the murder of Julie Ward, whose death was the
focus of a highly publicized Kenyan inquest last year.
   The 23-day inquest, conducted by Chief Magistrate Joseph Mango,
ruled Miss Ward had been murdered, despite the state's contention
that the wildlife photography enthusiast had been eaten by animals
in the sprawling southwestern game reserve.
   Miss Ward's partly charred lower left leg and lower jaw were
found in the reserve Sept. 13, 1988, a week after she reportedly
left the world-renowned park. Partly burned personal effects and
ashes were found near her remains six miles from her abandoned
vehicle.
   Miss Ward's father, Suffolk hotelier John Ward, has pressed for
a continued investigation into his daughter's murder and Kenyan
President Daniel arap Moi requested British assistance during a
private visit to London last month.
   An official at the High Commission, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Thompson would talk to Kenyan officials, read court
transcripts and study commission files on the case before returning
to Britain this weekend. He expects to return to Kenya in the next
month or two with a colleague.

   A state museum has decided to shut down an
exhibit featuring the exposed graves of 234 prehistoric American
Indians because of ``heightened sensitivity to display of human
remains,'' an official said.
   ``Our plans right now are to turn out the lights and to lock the
door,'' Judith Franke, the director of the Dickson Mounds Museum,
said Wednesday.
   Ms. Franke said the exhibit hadn't been the target of protests
or complaints, but clearly was a ``living-on-borrowed-time sort of
thing.''
   In the face of protests, the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington agreed last fall to return to American Indians, Eskimos
and Aleuts for burial more than 18,000 ancestral remains. Indian
groups had long sought their return on religious grounds, while
museum officials had argued the remains were needed for study.
   Ms. Franke said the rest of the Dickson Mounds Museum will be
open and the remains will likely remain where they are.
   ``Obviously, there is no question of moving the burials because
they have been here for 1,000 years and they have never been
moved,'' she said.
   The decision to close the exhibit ``definitely shows dignity and
respect for the prehistoric Native American remains in Illinois,''
Jesse Takes-Horse, a Crow Indian from the southern Illinois hamlet
of Dow, said Wednesday.
   Ms. Takes-Horse said Indian groups are drafting a letter to
formally request reburial of the remains, and said no decision had
been made on location.
   ``I think it's a good first step,'' said James Yellowbank, a
Winnebago Indian and coordinator of the Chicago-based Indian Treaty
Rights Organization. ``There's a lot of other burial sites that are
in question _ some in southern Illinois and some in Elgin.''
   The exposed graves, in an excavated burial mound, are the
highlight of the museum near this west-central Illinois community
of 3,000. The museum attracts 80,000 vistors annually who can see
the exhibit from an elevated viewing area. Photographing the
exhibit is prohibited.
   The bodies represent the last traces of the people who lived in
the Illinois River Valley area during the Late Woodland and
Mississippian cultural periods, between 800 and 1,000 years ago.
   The decision to close the exhibit to the public beginning Feb. 1
was prompted by ``heightened sensitivity to display of human
remains,'' said David Fields, a spokesman for Gov. James R.
Thompson.
   But Alan Harn, curator of anthropology at the museum, said the
decision represents a ``tremendous loss'' to Indian people.
   ``For 63 years, the Dickson excavation has been treated with the
absolute utmost respect, and ... many people go away from here with
a new appreciation of the place of the American Indian,'' Harn said.
   State Rep. Tom Homer said he will press for reversal of the
decision on grounds that closure of the popular exhibit may cripple
the tourist and cultural attraction.
   The Dickson burial site was discovered more than 60 years ago,
when landowner Don F. Dickson found ancient skeletons under the
family fruit orchard. The amateur archeologist began an excavation
in 1927 and later built a museum over the site.
   The museum, bought by the state in 1945, contains several other
exhibits focusing on the culture and lifestyle of prehistoric
Indians, who subsisted on corn and fish and lived in houses
thatched with prairie grass.

<HEAD>Israeli Former Intelligence Chief Says Shamir Hurt Agency's Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARIEH O'SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former director of Israel's Mossad
intelligence agency on Wednesday assailed Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's purported use of classified information to expose a
Cabinet minister's contacts with the PLO.
   Israeli newspaper reports quoted other intelligence officials as
saying the disclosures may have hurt state security and affected
the information-gathering capabilities of Mossad and Shin Bet,
Israel's external and internal intelligence agencies.
   ``If what I have read in the newspapers is correct ... harm has
been done to the intelligence services,'' former Mossad director
Meir Amit said.
   ``The political echelons must know the complexities and
sensitivities of gathering information, and they must think twice
before using this information,'' he told Israel television.
   Shamir, a former Mossad official, dismissed Amit's allegations
and said the material was used to stop Science Minister Ezer
Weizman from leaking confidential government information to
Palestinians.
   ``The use in this case was for state reasons of the highest
level,'' Shamir said. ``We are not talking about political needs
here ... grave damage was caused to Israel.''
   Shamir said he showed the classified material to no one and
``did not think that as a result any damage will be done.''
   Weizman's alleged contacts with the PLO ignited a political
crisis that almost brought down the coalition government. In
remarks Wednesday on army radio, he appeared to blame Shamir for
misusing the information he got from the agencies.
   ``I have no complaints against the Shin Bet or Mossad. I have
complaints against those who receive the material and decided
afterwards to use it for political reasons,'' Weizman said.
   The security services report directly to the prime minister.
   Shamir, 74, leader of the right-wing Likud bloc, forced Weizman
to quit the inner Cabinet, which is responsible for security
issues, but kept him on as science minister. He said Weizman, a
former defense minister, used his inside knowledge to thwart
government efforts to exclude the Palestine Liberation Organization
from negotiations.
   Left-wing dailies Davar and Al Hamishmar said Shamir based his
allegations on a Mossad report showing that Weizman met with PLO
official Nabil Ramlawi in a Geneva hotel room last June 6 and also
spoke by telephone to Israeli Arab Dr. Ahmed Tibi, who was in Tunis
acting as a go-between with PLO officials.
   Excerpts leaked to the press suggested Weizman advised the PLO
to push Shamir for a land-for-peace agreement and to insist on a
role in negotiations even though government policy is opposed to
PLO involvement.
   Yediot Ahronot newspaper quoted unidentified intelligence
sources as saying Shamir exposed sources and operational methods
``by the misuse of the intelligence material'' against Weizman.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin denied on army radio that
intelligence sources or methods were compromised.
   Asked if wiretaps were used against Weizman, Rabin replied: ``To
the best of my knowledge, political wiretapping of political
figures in the state of Israel does not exist.''
   But Dedi Zucker, a parliament member of the liberal Citizens
Rights Movement, said Shamir revealed that Israel had a transcript
of Ramlawi's conversation with Weizman.
   He suggested that Shamir pulled back from his threat to fire
Weizman lest an official investigation release ``much more than he
wanted.''

<TEXT>
   Under a U.S.-South Korean agreement
nearing completion, 5,000 to 6,000 U.S. soldiers will be withdrawn
this year because of U.S. congressional demands and defense budget
cuts, a report said Wednesday.
   About 43,000 American troops, including the 2nd U.S. Infantry
Division, are stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
U.S. troops fought on the South Korean side after Communist North
Korea invaded to start the 1950-53 Korean War.
   The national news agency Yonhap, citing unidentified Korean
government sources, said Wednesday that the two governments had
discussed restructuring U.S. troops in South Korea, including
reductions, in connection with a bill sponsored by Sens. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., and John Warner, R-Va.
   The bill requires the U.S. administration to report by April 1
on measures to reorganize American forces in East Asia, including
South Korea.
   The U.S. 8th Army headquarters in Seoul refused to comment on
the report.
   Yonhap, quoting another ranking government source, also said the
governments were studying the possibility of relocating U.S.
Marines now stationed in Okinawa to South Korea in a move linked to
the long-range idea of maintaining stability in East Asia.
   The Korean official was quoted as saying the two countries
shared the view that U.S. troops were needed at the present level
until there is improvement in relations between North and South
Korea.
   Washington repeatedly has said U.S. troops will not be withdrawn
as long as South Korean officials feel they are needed.
   In another report, the daily Dong-a Ilbo said that for the first
time the United States and South Korea were expected to scale back
this year's annual ``Team Spirit'' military exercises to create a
better atmosphere for North-South dialogue.
   Radical students and dissidents have staged violent
demonstrations demanding withdrawal of U.S. troops, claiming they
hinder unification efforts with North Korea. The radicals are a
small minority and polls show the majority of Koreans want the
Americans to stay until relations with North Korea improve.

<TEXT>
   Alan Hale Jr., who was a little-known
character actor until he struck lasting fame as the excitable
skipper of the 1960s hit television comedy ``Gilligan's Island,'
has died of cancer.
   Hale died Tuesday at St. Vincent Medical Center, where he had
been hospitalized for about a month, said Bonnie Churchill, a
family spokeswoman.
   She said Hale was 68; entertainment reference books indicate he
was 71.
   Hale appeared in 65 films but became famous as the captain who
led a mismatched band of castaways on ``Gilligan's Island,'' which
blossomed into one of the most often rerun shows in TV history.
   ``He enjoyed every single minute of it,'' said actor Bob Denver,
who portrayed Gilligan, the portly skipper's albatross and
accident-prone first mate. ``He wore his skipper's hat all the
time.''
   The actor asked to be cremated and his ashes scattered at sea
Saturday by the Neptune Society.
   ``He was a great guy and a great physical comic,'' said Denver,
who made personal appearances with Hale as recently as six months
ago. ``He was so strong that I could run across the stage and he
could catch me like a feather. That's what made our comedy so
great.''
   The TV show dealt with the ill-fated SS Minnow, shipwrecked on
an uncharted South Pacific isle after a freak storm during what was
supposed to be a three-hour tour.
   A native of Los Angeles, Hale came from a show business family;
his father was a matinee idol in silent films and his mother was an
actress. The younger Hale bore a strong resemblance to his father,
who also played sidekick roles with Errol Flynn in such classics as
``The Sea Hawk'' and ``Robin Hood.''
   But Hale was a marginally known character actor until his
``Gilligan's Island'' success. The show originally ran from 1964 to
1967 before going into syndication.
   The original cast, which included the late Jim Backus as
millionaire Thurston Howell III, got together in 1978 to make a
two-part ``Gilligan's Island'' special in which the castaways were
finally rescued, only to be shipwrecked again while on a reunion
cruise.
   Two more sequel specials were broadcast in 1979 and 1981.
   Hale is survived by his wife of 25 years, Naomi; their four
children and a sister.

   A Contra leader said Wednesday his
rebel group was ``incapable'' of the attack that killed two nuns,
one of them an American, and asserted Nicaragua was blaming the
rebels to rob them of U.S. congressional support.
   ``We protect the civilian population, we are Catholic and we
support the episcopal work of the Catholic Church,'' said Aristides
Sanchez of the Nicaraguan Resistance, in comments on Costa Rican
radio.
   But the leftist Sandinista government called the incident in
which a third nun and an auxiliary bishop also were wounded a
``premeditated ambush'' by the U.S.-backed Contras.
   The Bush administration deplored the killing of the nuns but
said the Managua government failed to back up its charge that
Contras were responsible. The body of Sister Maureen Courtney, 45,
will be flown back to her hometown of Milwaukee Thursday after a
memorial service Wednesday in a Managua church.
   Sister Courtney and Sister Teresa Rosales, 24, of Nicaragua were
killed when their pickup truck was attacked in a zone called Ojo de
Agua between the mining towns of Rosita and Siuna in northeastern
Nicaragua.
   The area is in a Contra stronghold in remote Zelaya province,
250 miles northeast of Managua, the capital.
   Both nuns belonged to the Order of St. Agnes, as did Sister
Francisca Colomer, 24, a third nun who suffered face and body
wounds. Auxiliary Bishop Pablo Schmitz, 48, from Fond du Lac, Wis.,
and of the Capuchin order, was wounded in the left arm.
   The two were being treated Wednesday in a Managua military
hospital and were expected to recover.
   Sister Jean Steffes, mother superior for the Sisters of St.
Agnes, said in Fond du Lac on Wednesday:
   ``Both sisters were killed instantly as result of gunfire. The
white pickup truck in which the group was traveling was clearly
marked with yellow crosses.
   ``When those still alive in the truck shouted they were
religious, the firing ceased, but by then two were dead.''
   Nicaragua's Roman Catholic Church said it does not know who
attacked the church workers.
   Before flying to Managua on an air force plane, Schmitz told
reporters in Puerto Cabezas he did not know who attacked them.
   ``I only know that a mine went off or a grenade and there was
heavy shooting afterward,'' Schmitz said. ``We identified
ourselves, but nobody came to the pickup.''
   Sanchez denied the Contras were involved and accused the
government of staging the attack.
   He said the Nicaraguan Resistance, an umbrella group of
anti-Sandinista organizations in exile, regrets the incident but
stressed the rebels ``are incapable of taking such an action.''
   In comments over the Costa Rican station Radio Impacto,
monitored in Managua, he called the Sandinista charges ``a
propaganda campaign'' to deprive the rebels of U.S. congressional
support.
   ``That sort of campaign is to be expected on the part of the
Sandinistas when a change in the aid by the U.S. Congress is
getting near,'' Sanchez said.
   Congress must soon decide whether to continue the non-lethal aid
it has been giving the Contras since February 1988. The aid package
for the rebels runs out after Nicaragua's general elections,
scheduled Feb. 25.
   Barricada, the official Sandinista newspaper, on Wednesday
called the attack ``a premeditated ambush'' by the Contras.
   Jaime Arauz, one of two peasants detained by the army in the
area of the attack, said the two were kidnapped by a Contra group
and were told the rebels were waiting to ambush an army convoy.
   Arauz spoke to The Associated Press and other news media in
Puerto Cabezas, a port town in northeastern Nicaragua, on Tuesday.
   Dennis Marker, director in Washington of the Witness for Peace
organization, said Wednesday that documented evidence shows to be
``totally false'' Contra denials that they operate in the area.
   He told The AP by telephone he knows of many cases of Contra
attacks in the area the past year, including the kidnapping two
times of a local pastor in the region where the attack occurred.
   Witness for Peace describes itself as a ``politically
independent organization that opposes U.S. support for the war
against Nicaragua, while not taking sides on internal political
issues.''

   Black leaders angered by the termination of
the city's first black superintendent launched a boycott of Selma's
public schools Wednesday, calling their fight ``the unfinished
civil rights movement.''
   Boycott leaders and demonstrating parents said the absence from
classrooms of one quarter of the city's 6,000 public school
students was at least a moral victory in their fight to keep school
chief Norward Roussell.
   But Mayor Joe Smitherman, a white who has been in and out of
office since Selma became a voting rights landmark in the 1960s,
called the boycott a failure based on the number of students
showing up for classes.
   The majority-white school board, citing an unfavorable job
evaluation, voted Dec. 21 not to renew Roussell's contract when it
expires June 30. The five blacks on the 11-member board then
resigned in protest.
   The evaluation described Roussell as dictatorial and said he had
allowed teacher morale to drop. He disputed the findings, calling
them unsubstantiated.
   Roussell, 55, opposed the boycott. He said having young people
in class was more important than his $80,000-a-year post.
   About a dozen pickets, including some children, gathered in the
morning chill outside Selma High School. Others protested at
several of the city's 10 other schools and at several businesses.
   Wearing a sign reading ``How long will Selma do wrong?'' picket
Lola Doss sang hymns and waved at passing cars near a gasoline
station owned by the family of one of the white school board
members.
   ``God is in charge, and Selma's arms are too short to box with
God,'' said Ms. Doss, who kept her son home from school.
   But other black parents heeded Roussell's request to ignore the
boycott.
   ``I sent my (two) children to school this morning,'' said Sheila
Mitchell. She said she was displeased with Roussell's treatment,
but added, ``Children should be in school.''
   Roussell said about 25 percent of the system's 6,039 students
were absent.
   The system, which is nearly 70 percent black, normally has a 10
percent absenteeism rate the first day after a long holiday break,
he said, so the number of those heeding the boycott is ``really
about 15 percent.''
   Rose Sanders, a black attorney who spearheaded the protest,
estimated that as many as 40 percent of the city's black students
did not go to class.
   ``That is a success,'' she said. ``This is the unfinished civil
rights movement or the unfinished Civil War.''
   Smitherman said plainclothes police officers used video cameras
at the schools to record those participating in protests. Mrs.
Sanders said officials had scared blacks from joining the protest
by threatening arrests on grounds of violating compulsory education
laws.
   The mayor denied the charge and said boycott leaders wanted to
be arrested.
   ``They wanted us to arrest, but we're not. We learned that
lesson in the '60s,'' Smitherman said.
   Some of the boycotting students were taken by parents or
demonstration leaders to the First Baptist Church of Selma, where
Mrs. Sanders and others spoke about civil rights history.
   Roussell, who came to Selma in 1987 from New Orleans, said his
firing was not the real reason for the protests.
   ``This is not about me and it's not about the school system,''
said Roussell. ``It's about what happened on the Pettus Bridge 25
years ago.''
   Troopers used tear gas and clubs on black marchers in 1965 as
they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge over the Alabama River at
downtown Selma. The violence helped inspire a march to Montgomery
and, later, passage of the federal voting rights law.
   Some blacks also protested Roussell's termination by withdrawing
thousands of dollars from two banks with ties to school board
members. But Smitherman said the city soon would deposit $500,000
in municipal accounts at each of the two banks.

<HEAD>Missing Sikh Lawmaker's Body Found in Canal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The body of a newly elected Sikh member
of Parliament was found in a canal Wednesday, 10 days after he was
reported missing, United News of India said.
   Jagdev Singh Khudian, who won a seat in Parliament in the Nov.
22-26 general elections, disappeared Dec. 25. Police found his
turban, shoes and other personal belongings on the bank of a canal
near his home in northern Punjab state.
   UNI said his body was found two miles downstream from where the
belongings were discovered. There was no immediate word on the
cause of death.
   Khudian, a member of a semi-religious Sikh party tacitly
supported by Sikh militants, was sworn in to Parliament in New
Delhi on Dec. 21.
   According to police, his family members first claimed Khudian
was abducted by four Sikh militants. However, they later said the
gray-haired lawmaker went out for a walk and did not return.
   Members of Khudian's Akali Dal party won 6 of the 13
parliamentary seats in Punjab. Three of the other seats were won by
independents supported by the party.
   Police sources say Sikh militants could be responsible for
Khudian's death because he was one of the four Akali Dal members
who took the oath of allegiance to the constitution when he was
sworn in, which amounted to renouncing separatism.
   Sikh militants have been campaigning for an independent nation
in Punjab since 1982. At least 1,820 people were killed in the
state in 1989 in violence blamed on the secessionist campaign.
   Sikhs form 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are in a
majority in Punjab. Sikh militants claim their community is
discriminated against by the Hindus, who make up 80 percent of the
population.

<TEXT>
   Nicaragua asked the Security Council to
meet in urgent session next Monday to denounce the ransacking by
U.S. troops of the residence of Nicaragua's ambassador to Panama.
   The Nicaraguan Mission said deputy U.N. envoy Daysi Estela
Moncada Bermudez made the request in a letter to Security Council
President Amara Essy and in a meeting Wednesday.
   No immediate response came from the council.
   The Organization of American States will discuss the issue
Friday.
   Nicaragua also sent a letter to Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar protesting the killing of two nuns in Nicaragua, an
attack the Managua government has linked to the U.S.-backed Contra
rebels. The Contras denied it.
   Nicaragua did not request a council meeting at this time, but
asked that its protest be circulated in the Security Council and
General Assembly.
   The first letter said U.S. soldiers invaded the ambassador's
residence and later ransacked the home of another Nicaraguan
diplomat in Panama City Sunday.
   President Bush said the raid on the ambassador's residence was a
``screw-up,'' but asked why a diplomat needed the heavy weapons
that were found there.
   The Nicaraguan letter called the U.S. invasion and occupation of
Panama ``not only a violation of the U.N. Charter, but also a grave
threat to international peace and security in the region.''
   Cuba and Nicaragua have called urgent meetings of the Security
Council and the General assembly to condemn the U.S. invasion as a
breach of international law. The United States, Britain and France
vetoed proposed criticism in the Security Council, but last Friday
the General Assembly sternly rebuked the United States.

<HEAD>US: Mistress Trying to Lure Ex-Dictator from Vatican Embassy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. military officials are trying to
persuade the mistress of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to lure the
ousted dictator from his refuge in the Vatican Embassy, reliable
Panamanian sources said Wednesday.
   Vicky Amado, 35, was freed Tuesday by the U.S. Southern Command
after being detained six days in a U.S. military installation.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Ms. Amado
talked to Noriega for 10 minutes after her release. But they said
she did not try to convince him to leave the Vatican mission, which
has been surrounded by U.S. soldiers since he fled there on
Christmas Eve.
   Instead, the sources said she told him to do what he thought
best.
   ``The decision is in your hands,'' they said she told Noriega.
   While she was detained, the Southern Command questioned Ms.
Amado about her relationship with the former military leader.
   The sources said she was under ``great psychological pressure''
while in custody but had otherwise received special treatment
compared to the estimated 5,000 other Panamanian prisoners being
held by the occupying U.S. forces.
   Ms. Amado has been Noriega's lover for several years.
   The Southern Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in
Central and South America, say Noriega's first telephone call while
he was in hiding after the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion was to Ms. Amado,
not his wife.
   His wife Felicidad and three daughters have sought asylum at the
Cuban Embassy, which is also ringed by U.S. troops.

   A motorist who pleaded guilty to charges
stemming from a bloody rampage along a crowded downtown street last
year was sentenced Wednesday to a minimum of 13 years in prison.
   Jerome D. Greene pleaded guilty to charges of mayhem while
armed, assault with a deadly weapon, a motor vehicle, and
destruction of property.
   Greene's delivery truck careened into utility poles, a telephone
booth, a van, several cars and a bus before striking and dragging a
woman for more than 100 feet before hitting three more cars and
finally coming to a stop.
   An angry crowd of onlookers prevented Greene from fleeing after
he jumped out of the truck, and a public uproar followed disclosure
that police released him after issuing two citations for motor
vehicle offenses.
   One pedestrian lost her left kneecap in the Feb. 17 accident.
Indictments against Greene said he struck at least five people plus
``others unknown to the grand jury,'' and scores of pedestrians
were forced to scramble for their lives.
   Officials said that blood alcohol tests conducted shortly after
the incident indicated that Greene had been driving while
intoxicated.

<TEXT>
   The leaders of eight African nations
will meet next week in Angola to discuss peace prospects in the
15-year civil war between the Angolan government and UNITA rebels,
Angola's state news agency said Wednesday.
   In a report monitored in Lisbon from Luanda, the Angolan
capital, ANGOP said the presidents of Angola, Congo, Gabon,
Mozambique, Sao Tome e Principe, Zaire, Zimbabwe, and Zambia will
meet next Wednesday, Jan. 10.
   The meeting was scheduled for December, but Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos called a postponement. In a New Year's
speech, dos Santos presented an eight-point plan for ending
hostilities, and hinted that free elections may be held in the
one-party Marxist state within five years.
   Reports of heavy fighting in the southeast of the country,
meanwhile, continued to reach Lisbon. The Diario de Lisboa
newspaper cited military sources in Luanda as claiming major
successes against UNITA _ the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.
   The paper said government forces had captured the strategic town
of Mavinga, 687 miles southeast of Luanda. Mavinga is thought to be
a key position in the defense of the rebels' bush headquarters at
Jamba.
   There was no official government confirmation of the Diario de
Lisboa report. UNITA officials denied the town had fallen, but have
accused the government of launching a major offensive in the
southeast.
   Dos Santos' New Year proposals demanded the recognition of the
current Angolan government, the integration of UNITA guerrillas
into the Angolan army and a revision of the Constitution leading to
national elections.
   Without giving details, dos Santos said he would propose a new
mechanism for monitoring a cease-fire simplifying a verification
plan put forward by Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, the
official mediator in the peace process.
   He said Mobuto's plan was too complex to control a guerrilla war.
   Mobuto hosted a meeting between dos Santos and UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi in Gbadolite, Zaire, last June. A cease-fire
collapsed within days and talks between the two sides broke down.
   The group of eight leaders have met three times to discuss the
Angolan situation, most recently in September. Savimbi has refused
to attend such meetings and dismissed them as ``disastrous to the
process of peace.''
   UNITA, backed previously by South Africa and now by the United
States, has been fighting to share power with the Cuban-supported
government since Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

   The Bush administration declared anew
Wednesday that it wants Manuel Antonio Noriega brought to trial in
the United States on drug-trafficking charges, but declined to rule
out other options.
   Under questioning, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
would not rule out the possiblity of an agreement that would send
the deposed ruler, who has been in the Vatican Embassy in Panama
City since Christmas Eve, to a third country.
   Fitzwater said, as he has in the past, that Noriega's fate now
rests largely with the Roman Catholic Church.
   ``I want to make clear from this podium our positon is we want
him returned to the United States,'' Fitzwater said at his daily
briefing for reporters. But, he added, ``we will not rule out any
and every other kind of option.''
   Later, the presidential spokesman called news organizations to
assert that he had not intended to signal a change in U.S. policy.
   ``I did not want to imply any change,'' Fitzwater said. ``Our
position is that we want him returned to the United States for
prosecution. There is absolutely no change in our position.''
   As rumors swirled of an impeding movement of Noriega out of his
refuge, Fitzwater said just before going home early in the evening
the White House ``won't know anything until he comes out the door.
We're just watching.'' He declined to say more about talks with
church officials, maintaining, ``It's up to the Vatican.''
   Another official said the administration had chased ``two days
of dry hole rumors'' about Noriega's fate.
   Administration officials in the past have appeared to reject the
idea of allowing Noriega exile in a third country, where he would
be safe from U.S. prosecution.
   Last Saturday, Bush, speaking to reporters on a Houston golf
course, was asked why allowing Noreiga to go to a third country _ a
course once suggested by the United States if Noriega would
voluntarily leave power _ was no longer acceptable.
   ``The death of one Marine, the brutalization of a wife of a
lieutenant, the death of a lot of our kids; that's what changed.
And that's why I feel very strongly that we're not back to square
one,'' Bush said.
   On Wednesday, Fitzwater said:
   ``We've never said `no third country.' What we have said is, `We
want him to come back to the United States.' But we are not going
to rule out every other alternative.''
   At the same time, Fitzwater said a report that Noriega may have
been tipped off in advance of the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion of Panama
``does not appear to be true.''
   The report, which first appeared in Friday's editions of The
Washington Times, suggested Noriega may have had 48 hours warning
of the U.S. action. However, Fitzwater said, ``It seems unlikley
there was a tip-off in view of all the accounts of his surprise _
that he was having dinner in a restaurant supposedly and drove all
over town and so forth.''
   Fitzwater, asked about reports that the Vatican would release
Noriega only if he could be guaranteed that he would receive a fair
trial and that his life would not be in danger, said ``He will
receive a fair trial in this country.''
   And, the spokesman added, ``under terms of the indictments, he
is not subject to capital punishment.''
   Noriega could receive up to 145 years in prison and more than
$1.1 million in fines if he were convicted of drug-trafficking
charges on indictments handed down in February 1988 in federal
courts in Miami and Tampa, Fla.
   Meanwhile, American and Peruvian officials said Wednesday that
Peru, which pulled out as a participant in an upcoming drug summit
in Colombia to protest the U.S. invasion of Panama, has reversed
course and says it will attend the conference.
   In another development, the envoy designated by Panamanian
President Guillermo Endara as ambassador to the Organization of
American States, Lawrence Chewning Fabrega, presented his
credentials Wednesday to OAS officials in Washington, even though
he was initially rebuffed by the OAS.
   As of Tuesday, 11 governments have officially recognized the
U.S.-installed Endara government and 24 others have indicated
acceptance by establishing contact with the Foreign Ministry, the
State Department said.

<TEXT>
   Lawrence Alloway, an art critic and former
curator of the Guggenheim Museum credited with coining the term
``pop art,'' has died at age 63.
   Alloway died of cardiac arrest Tuesday at his home in Manhattan.
   Born in Wimbledon, England, Alloway studied art history at the
University of London but never earned a degree. From 1954 to 1957,
he served as director of London's Institute of Contemporary Art,
where he became known for his shows and critiques of avant-garde
artists. In 1958, he won a grant to study art in the United States.
   Alloway served as curator of the Guggenheim Museum from 1962 to
1966, wrote art criticism for The Nation from 1963 to 1971 and
taught art history at the State University of New York at Stony
Brook from 1968 to 1981. There he cofounded ``Art Criticism''
magazine with the critic Donald Kuspit.
   An early champion of postwar American art, he is credited with
abbreviating the term popular art into ``pop art'' to denote new
work by younger artists that dealt with consumer images.
   Alloway wrote several books, including a study of violence in
American films.
   He is survived by his wife, painter Sylvia Sleigh.

<HEAD>Attorney Calls LA Board of Supervisors a Gerrymandering `All-White
Club'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
is an ``all-white club'' that created voting districts with the aim
of ensuring that Hispanics can't join, a civil rights lawyer
charged Wednesday.
   The county's lawyer denied the charge in opening arguments in a
federal voting rights lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department,
the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Foundation.
   ``No supervisor had even the slightest intent to discriminate
against Hispanics,'' said attorney John McDermott.
   The lawsuit alleges that the supervisors spread the county's
large Hispanic population across three districts in redrawing
voting boundaries in 1981.
   The move has made it impossible for a Hispanic to be elected to
the board, the suit contends, even though Hispanics make up at
least 27 percent of the county's 8.5 million residents. A Hispanic
has never been elected to the five-member board.
   ``Each supervisor treated Hispanics as pawns, strategic means by
which to hold off the other side,'' the ACLU's Mark Rosenbaum
charged. ``This is an old-fashioned case about racial
gerrymandering.''
   McDermott, however, said the allegations were based on
misleading statistical information.
   The board is the chief policy-making body and administers
services in the nation's most populous county. The supervisors,
each representing more than a million constituents, are some of the
most powerful elected officials in California.
   The trial was delayed for several weeks as both sides tried to
reach an out-of-court settlement. U.S. District Judge David V.
Kenyon said Tuesday he would not allow a settlement once the trial
began.
   Both parties appeared close to a settlement last month when the
Board of Supervisors agreed to redraw Supervisor Pete Schabarum's
district to bring the number of Hispanic voters in the area up to
36.5 percent. The compromise fell apart, however, when the board
rejected a counterproposal to increase Hispanic voters in the
district to 49.4 percent.
   The last chance for an out-of-court settlement appeared lost
Tuesday when the board voted 3-2 against a proposal to expand from
five to seven members.

<HEAD>Economic Turmoil Taking Toll on Argentines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>

   Pascual Bonaiutto said he walked
a mile Wednesday searching at every pharmacy along the way for
sedatives that a month ago most drug stores carried.
   ``In no place could I get what I need,'' said the 58-year-old
waiter from La Boca, an aged but picturesque Buenos Aires
neighborhood. ``I don't want to blame anyone, but I feel desperate,
hopeless, sick of this country.''
   Shortages, price hikes and economic unrest seem to be taking a
toll on the emotions of Argentines who were shocked by food riots
last May, then jarred when inflation topped 196 percent in July and
jolted anew last month when the economy unraveled even further.
   The election of Carlos Menem as president last May brought hope
of better times: inflation headed down for a change, dipping to
single digits in September, and workers were encouraged when real
wages recovered somewhat.
   But the stability proved short-lived.
   In recent weeks, the slide of the austral against the U.S.
dollar accelerated, prices literally doubled overnight and
supermarkets became scenes of panic-buying and empty shelves.
   Clothing boutiques, hardware stores, travel agencies and other
businesses seem to have few customers in this capital of 11 million
residents.
   ``I'm selling five pairs of shoes a day,'' said Omar Sanchez,
47. ``If things continue like this, I'm going to have to close.
Then I'm going to stand in the doorway of Government House and
demand that they give me work.''
   What analysts said was a lack of public confidence in Menem's
plans to privatize the many state industries and deregulate the
economy touched off a sudden devaluation of the national currency,
the austral.
   Banks offered interest rates at 600 percent a month to try to
attract customers converting funds to U.S. dollars, a safe haven
traditionally for moneyed Argentines.
   After changing his economy minister and Central Bank president
last month, Menem endorsed a new economic plan _ his fourth so far
_ to try again to stabilize the economy.
   On New Year's Day, Economy Minister Antonio Gonzalez restricted
the amount australs in circulation and banks were ordered closed
Tuesday and Wednesday so the population could digest the latest
austerity measures. The banks are set, along with foreign exchange
houses, to reopen Thursday.
   The austral so far has stabilized. Currency venders on
streetcorners sold dollars Wednesday for about 1,800 australs
apiece, equal to last Thursday.
   The effect of the latest change won't be known until banks open
and interest and exchange rates, both of which have been set by
supply and demand since Dec. 10, become public.
   For the moment, the shortages and price hikes seem containable.
Suppliers began resuming shipments Wednesday, and supermarkets
agreed to price guidelines on a basket of the basic commodities
like milk, rice, noodles and bottled water.
   However, politicians of both major political parties _ Menem's
labor-based Peronist and the Radical Civil Union _ say they fear
that by mid-January social unrest such as food riots may again
occur. Some even fear military intervention again; the junta last
ruled Argentina from 1976-83.
   Said Cesar Jaroslavsky, head of the opposition bloc in the lower
House of Deputies:
   ``There seem to be two clocks functioning _ one that advances
slowly on a par with the government's understanding of what is
happening, the other racing ahead of the crisis.''

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people shouting ``No
More!'' and ``Assassin!'' marched Wednesday to the Vatican Embassy,
where Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was closeted with a broken TV
while his fate was being negotiated.
   A crowd estimated at 20,000 filled five blocks of Avenida Balboa
leading to the embassy. U.S. soldiers and tanks at checkpoints kept
the crowd 150 yards from the embassy gates.
   Noriega was said to be in ``strict isolation'' after Monsignor
Sebastian Laboa, the papal nuncio, told his staff not to speak to
the ousted dictator. An embassy spokesman said the television set
in the room was broken.
   Panamanian sources said the U.S. Southern Command was trying to
convince Noriega's longtime mistress to try to lure Noriega out the
embassy.
   But the sources, who asked not to be further identified, said
Vicky Amado talked to Noriega for 10 minutes after her release from
a U.S. military facility Tuesday and told the deposed strongman:
``The decision is in your hands.''
   In Washington, the Bush administration said after Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger met with Panama's new
leaders that letting Noriega go to a third country was an option.
   Later Wednesday however Eagleburger said U.S. policy that
Noriega should be sent to Florida to face drug trafficking charges
rather than to a third country had not changed.
   ``We want Noriega in the United States. Period,'' he said.
   Foreign Minister Julio Linares said Panama's constitution did
not permit the general's extradition to the United States. The
Vatican has said it would not deliver Noriega directly to the
United States and would deal with Panama.
   Linares threatened to break diplomatic relations with Cuba and
Nicaragua, which he said ``were allies of Noriega's military
dictatorship'' and had made statements that ``besmirch the good
name of Panama.''
   ``If they continue to harass Panama, we will be forced to review
our relations with them,'' he said. ``There is a strong opinion in
Panama that there should be a break in relations.''
   Problems appeared in President Guillermo Endara's new
administration. Col. Roberto Armijo, who had been Noriega's police
chief, quit as head of the newly created public safety forces.
   Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon said the resignation had
nothing to do with ``relations between the government and the
public safety forces.''
   Arias said Armijo stepped down after a ``financial matter that
deserves an investigation'' was discovered. He did not elaborate,
but said the investigation was under way.
   One demonstrator in the Avenida Balboa crowd held a sign that
read ``No Mercy'' in six languages. Speakers went to a platform and
shouted ``No more! No more!''
   Vendors sold T-shirts that had ``I survived the U.S. invasion''
on the front and the operation's code name ``Just Cause'' in the
back. The demonstrators dispersed without incident at nightfall.
   Vatican Embassy spokesman Jose Cubillas said two Noriega aides
were ``very nervous'' about the military activity around the
compound, which is ringed by barbed wire and dozens of U.S.
soldiers.
   Seventeen others are believed to have joined Noriega in the
Vatican Embassy, including Lt. Col. Nivaldo Madrinan, director of
his secret police, and Capt. Eliezer Gaytan, chief of his personal
security force.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
Bush administration was sticking to its position that Noriega be
delivered to U.S. authorities to face drug trafficking charges, but
added: ``We will not rule out any and every other kind of option.''
   Officials said Eagleburger had no direct role in negotitions to
get Noriega out of the embassy, where he has been closeted for 10
days, but his visit came while a Vatican envoy was in Panama to
help with the negotiations
   A delegation led by Eagleburger met with Endara and other new
Panamanian leaders Wednesday to plan American help for economic
recovery.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, and Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the committee's ranking
minority member, were in Panama to evaluate the U.S. operation.
   Linares said ``Panama cannot constitutionally and juridically''
extradite Noriega to the United States, even though Endara and
others have said they would prefer Noriega go there rather than to
a third country where he could make trouble.
   Armijo was replaced as head of the new security forces by Lt.
Col. Eduardo Herrera, who was military attache in Israel at the
time of the U.S. invasion Dec. 20.
   In an interview Tuesday, Armijo said many of Noriega's henchmen
had eluded capture and had sought asylum in the Vatican and other
embassies.
   Unexpectedly heavy fighting between pro-Noriega forces and U.S.
troops heavily damaged many parts of Panama City, once a thriving
commercial and financial hub of 1 million. Looter plundered
hundreds of stores of merchandise ranging from food to furniture.
   Eagleburger was traveling with acting Secretary of the Treasury
John Robson and by Mark Edelman, acting director of the U.S. Agency
for International Development. His visit coincided with a trip by
Monsignor Giacinto Berloco, a Vatican diplomat and Latin American
specialist.

<HEAD>Brazil to Remove Gold Miners from Amazon Land</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has announced a $4
million operation to remove tens of thousands of illegal gold
miners from the Amazon jungle lands of the Yanomami Indians, one of
the world's largest primitive tribes.
   The operation is a response to an international outcry to
protect the Yanomamis from disease and violence brought by the
miners, said the National Indian Office in Brasilia, the capital.
   ``We're backed by a presidential decree and humanitarian
reasons. The miners will be removed by force if necessary,'' Col.
Airton Alcantara Gomes, No. 2 at the Indian Office, said in a
telephone interview.
   About 40,000 clandestine miners are believed to have invaded
Yanomami lands in the remote northwestern state of Roraima, near
Brazil's border with Venezuela. Some 9,000 Yanomamis live in the
region, which is rich in gold, tin and diamonds.
   ``Mining is an evil, and not even a necessary evil,'' Gomes
said. ``It pollutes the rivers, destroys the rain forest and
devastates Indian tribes.'' The operation is to start Sunday with
the closing of air strips near Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima.
Only four strips will be kept open for official use, he said.
   ``Small planes are the main means of bringing in food, supplies,
fuel, guns, alcohol, drugs, everything. We'll even seize planes if
necessary,'' Gomes said.
   About 400 federal police, Air Force and Indian Office agents
then will comb the jungle to find and remove prospectors, he said.
   Gomes said government agents expected to face violent resistance
from some miners, instigated by the controllers of the mining sites.
   ``The only ones who profit from gold mining are a half dozen big
controllers and a few airplane owners. The benefit for the country
is zero, because most of the gold is smuggled out,'' he said.
   The removal is expected to take 60 days. Federal police will be
permanently stationed in the region to prevent miners from
returning, Gomes said.
   In a separate operation, five medical teams from the Health
Ministry and the Indian Office began visiting Yanomami villages to
treat a growing outbreak of disease.
   ``Because of the presence of the miners, many Indians have
malaria, tuberculosis and venereal diseases. There also is a lot of
malnutrition, because fish and game have disappeared from some
areas,'' Gomes said.
   Traveling by helicopter and on foot, the medical teams are to
visit every Yanomami village in 45 days and distribute 8,140 pounds
of medicine and supplies, he said.
   Environmental and Indian defense groups in November told the
nation's Congress that 280 Yanomamis had died since 1987. About 70
percent of the tribal land, which originally covered 22 million
acres, has been made into national forests and parks.
   Defenders of the Yanomami cause include British rock star Sting
and Indian chief Davi Kopenawa, winner of a United Nations Global
500 award in 1988 for defense of the environment.
   There are about 220,000 native Indians left in Brazil, down from
an estimated 5 million when the country was discovered by the
Portuguese in 1500.

   Argentine merchant ships now may
sail near the Falkland Islands for the first time since Argentina
lost its 1982 battle with Britain for the South Atlantic
archipelago, the Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday.
   Britain modified the 150-mile ``protection zone'' it has
enforced since regaining the islands in a 74-day war.
   Argentine merchant ships may travel within the area from 150
miles out to 12 miles, the territorial limit enforced by Britain.
To sail into the 12-mile limit, British permission is needed.
   The vessels may not fish in the zone without permission.
   Argentine military ships must still request and receive British
permission before entering the zone.
   The new arrangement, which took effect Jan. 1, was agreed to
last October at British-Argentine talks in Madrid.
   The two countries resumed consular relations last month for the
first time since Argentina invaded the windswept territory it has
claimed since 1810 and which it calls the Malvinas. Talks are to
resume in Madrid Feb. 14-15 after which full diplomatic relations
may be restored.
   The issue of sovereignty has been set aside, but Argentina has
refused to give up its claim to the territory.
   The Falklands are home to 1,800 islanders.
   ``The United Kingdom lifted yesterday the restriction on the
navigation of Argentine merchant ships in the 150-mile military
zone,'' Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo told reporters.
   ``Argentina has the firm intention of recovering its sovereignty
through negotiation,'' a ministry communique stated Wednesday, the
157th anniversary of the ousting by British forces of an Argentine
garrison on the islands in 1833.

   Noriega, who faces federal drug trafficking charges in Florida,
was taken to a church school across the street from the embassy and
went through the school to where two U.S. Army helicopters were
parked.
   The helicopters lifted off at about 9:10 p.m. and Laboa, who had
accompanied Noriega to the helicopter, returned to the embassy.
   In Washington, President Bush in a nationwide address Wednesday
confirmed the detention of Noriega and said the former dictator
would be flown on a C-130 transport plane from Howard Air Force
Base in Panama to Homestead Air Force Base in south Florida to face
arraignment at the U.S. District Court in Miami.
   Bush in his remarks from the White House thanked the Vatican and
the papal nuncio in Panama for its help and promised Noriega would
receive a fair trial.

   Two defendants named in the drug trafficking
indictment that includes Manuel Antonio Noriega requested separate
trials Wednesday, hours before the deposed Panamanian leader was
arrested by U.S. drug agents in Panama.
   Prior to Noriega's arrest Wednesday night, a federal judge
assigned to the case said he wouldn't rule on the requests until
later this month, and might hold off beginning the trials if
Noriega is extradited to face charges in Miami.
   ``At present, we have four defendants, however if the situation
in Panama should resolve itself in another week and if we have five
defendants _ and one of them is General Noriega _ then the whole
situation changes,'' said U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler.
   Later Wednesday in Washington, President Bush announced the
former dictator had turned himself in after nine days inside the
Vatican embassy in Panama City and was arrested by Drug Enforcement
Administration agents at Howard Air Force Base in Panama.
   Noriega was put aboard a military transport plane bound for
Homestead Air Force Base in Florida and will be arraigned in U.S.
District Court in Miami on drug trafficking charges, the president
said. If convicted on all charges, Noriega could be sentenced to
145 years in prison and fined $1.1 million.
   The request for separate trials was made by William Saldarriaga,
45, and Brian Davidow, 28, who were among 16 people indicted in
February 1988 by a federal grand jury in Miami.
   Also Wednesday, a federal official in Miami who spoke on
condition of anonymity said another co-defendant of Noriega has
been arrested and would be flown to Homestead Air Force Base
sometime Wednesday night.
   The defendant, pilot Eduardo Pardo, allegedly flew a plane from
Fort Lauderdale to Panama with $800,000 in drug profits on board,
according to the indictment. Pardo faces five years in prison and
$10,000 in fines if convicted.
   Saldarriaga, a reputed Colombian drug trafficker, is being held
without bond at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center south
of Miami. Davidow is free on bond. Both men have pleaded innocent,
and neither attended Wednesday's court session.
   Steven Kriesberg, attorney for Saldarriaga, said his client
should have a separate trial because he is not charged with the
principal racketeering and conspiracy counts in the indictment.
   Davidow's attorney, Richard Sharpstein, said that his client
should be tried separately because of the publicity surrounding
events in Panama before and after last month's U.S. invasion that
toppled Noriega's government.
   The indictment issued in Miami accuses Noriega of accepting
millions of dollars in bribes from Colombia's Medellin cartel in
exchange for allowing drug traffickers to use Panama as a conduit
for tons of cocaine smuggled into the United States.
   Other defendants in custody are Lt. Col. Luis Del Cid, 46,
alleged to be a principal advisor of Noriega's, and Daniel Miranda,
36. Del Cid is being held pending a Jan. 16 hearing. Miranda is
scheduled for a court hearing Friday.
   Miranda on Tuesday refused to answer charges and an innocent
plea was entered by a U.S. Magistrate.
   An attorney for Del Cid, who hs pleaded innocent, said Wednesday
they have no objections to moves by co-defendants for separate
trials. Miranda's attorney was not present in court.

   Crewmen of a Navy weapons train that ran
over a peace activist and cut off his legs cannot sue the victim
and his fellow demonstrators for causing them emotional distress, a
federal judge said.
   In a pretrial ruling released Wednesday, U.S. District Judge
Robert Peckham rejected what he called the ``novel legal theory''
that an injured political protester is responsible for traumatizing
those who injured him.
   He said a reasonable jury could not conclude that the
protesters' acts made it ``inevitable that the train would run them
over.''
   The judge also ruled that evidence that the train was intended
to scare demonstrators off the tracks may be enough to show a
violation of their constitutional rights. But Peckham threw out a
suit by the injured activist, S. Brian Willson, against the
commander of the Concord Naval Weapons Station, saying the
commander did not cause the accident.
   Trial is scheduled April 24 in a suit by Willson, his wife,
Holley Rauen, and three others against the government, the train
crewmen and two supervisors at the naval station east of San
Francisco.
   ``I'm sure it's a great relief to Brian Willson and his wife to
no longer be facing claims that they're required to compensate the
crew for emotional distress caused by running over them,'' said
their chief lawyer, Thomas Steel.
   The crewmen's lawyer, William Kolin, did not return a telephone
call.
   Willson and others opposing U.S. arms shipments to Central
America demonstrated Sept. 1, 1987, at Concord Station, where they
said the weapons shipments were originating. A train from the
station hit Willson as he sat on the tracks, severing both legs at
the knee.
   The demonstrators' suit seeks damages for violations of the
rights of free speech and assembly and the right against illegal
seizure, for illson's medical costs and for emotional distress.
   The judge also rejected a slander suit by the three civilian
crewmen against several demonstrators for calling the accident an
act of attempted murder. Peckham said the statements were
expressions of opinion rather than factual assertions.

   A Foreign Office spokesman early Thursday welcomed

   ``We are glad that this problem between the U.S. and the Vatican

   Members of Congress exulted Wednesday night
over the surrender of the deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega to U.S. authorities.
   ``The international snake Noriega has finally been put in his
cage,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo.
   ``Noriega will finally have his day in court, which is more than
he gave the people of Panama,'' commented the Republican leader in
the Senate, Bob Dole of Kansas. ``Noriega's bad news is good news
for our war on drugs. It proves America won't give up or cave in to
anyone, no matter how powerful or corrupt.''
   ``All Americans rejoice that the United States armed forces have
brought this indicted drug-running thug to justice,'' said Sen.
Carl. Levin, D-Mich.
   Rep. James Courter, R-N.J., said his major concern was now:
``The world's eyes are on us. We have to afford him any protection
under the Constitution.''
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he was certain Noriega would
receive the same fair trial that any individual would get, and
moreover, ``The arrest of General Noriega removes the last
impediment to the Endara government's ability to be a functional
and viable entity in Panama.''
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., said she was ``definitely
relieved,'' and she hoped ``we won't be tied up in our own legal
knots.''
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said, ``This is an achievement by the
president that the public ought to take note of. ... Just bear in
mind that the kingpin has been nabbed and he is on his way to the
pokey in Miami.''

   U.S. efforts to pry ousted Panamanian dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega from the Vatican Embassy in Panama City may
be indirectly complicating the fate of another embassy fugitive a
world away, Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi.
   A senior Bush administration official familiar with developments
in China said the Beijing government appears to be ``watching
closely'' to see how the Noriega episode plays out _ and watching
with some sense of irony.
   Fang has been sheltered in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing since the
Tiananmen Square crackdown last June.
   So far, the United States has shown no more inclination to turn
Fang over to Chinese officials, who want to arrest him, than the
Vatican has displayed in responding to U.S. demands for Noriega.

   The Food and Drug Administration is concerned
that two independent surveys found milk supplies in several areas
contaminated with potentially harmful drugs, but the government
says it sees no public health threat.
   The FDA is testing retail milk supplies in 13 cities in response
to the surveys by The Wall Street Journal and the Center for
Science in the Public Interest that found some samples were tainted
with veterinary drugs.
   The testing should be completed within two to three weeks and
the results will be made public, FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said

   The FDA said that although it ``is concerned that these

prepare to have a special election,'' Garcia spokesman Ron
Simoncini said Tuesday. ``It may not be the last possible moment
but ... he views this as the time to do it.''
   Garcia's office issued a statement Tuesday saying he will quit
his House seat effective Sunday. The 56-year-old congressman and
his wife, Jane Lee Garcia, 48, were convicted in October of
extorting $178,500 in cash, loans and jewelry from the Wedtech
Corp., a now-defunct defense contractor based in Garcia's South
Bronx district.
   Sentencing is set for Jan. 19. The Garcias face up to 45 years
each in prison and $750,000 in fines. In addition, the congressman
is under investigation by the House ethics committee, although that
probe will become moot once he quits.

   North America's movie theaters reaped a
record $5 billion-plus at the box office in 1989, powered by the
punch of ``Batman'' and other highly promoted action films.
   Despite a lackluster Christmas holiday season, summertime
moviegoers spun the turnstiles at such a dizzying pace that the
box-office record of $4.45 billion from 1988 was smashed, according
to figures released Tuesday.
   The box-office record was set even though fewer films were
released: 446 features made their debuts in 1989, down 13 percent
from the previous year.
   In the studio-by-studio race, Warner Bros. was No. 1 with an
estimated 17.1 percent share of all U.S. and Canadian tickets sold.

   The very nature of suburbia aggravates one
overriding problem _ travel. This second story in a three-part

increasing difficulties in simply getting around.

   Housing tracts are blowing away the
sagebrush out here in the Mojave Desert, and the legends of the Old
West are being supplanted by those of a new one.
   Meet the new riders of the purple sage:
   _The motorcyclist who commutes 170 miles across the Los Angeles
basin each day.
   _The highway patrolman who drives 90 minutes each morning to
East Los Angeles, where he spends the day riding around in a
cruiser.
   _The defense plant worker who, exhausted by the four-hour daily
odyssey between home and job, spends the night in his car in the
company parking lot.
   A long, harrowing trip to and from work is no longer remarkable
in the new suburban metropolis; it is merely the price that must be
paid for a single family house. And the price is always going up.
   As traffic bogs down more of the time and homes pop up ever
farther from jobs, the logistics of suburban travel are breaking
down. In greater L.A., for example, almost every hour is rush hour,
and an estimated 84,000 hours a day are lost in traffic jams.
   Some of those hours belong to Mary McKeon, 31, whose desire for
a new three-bedroom, two-bath house on a half-acre brought her to
this community in the high desert east of Los Angeles.
   The stars are still blinking when she begins the two-hour
morning drive across the desert, through the mountain pass and down
to her office in the city.
   For 45 minutes, she zips along at 70; but traffic moves fitfully
after she hits I-10, so Mary listens to her favorite Country and
Western station and dreams of the days when six minutes were all
that separated her job and her family's apartment.
   She misses the time others spend at home. ``My daughters are
having to learn to cook without me _ and my husband and I have to
eat it,'' she laughs. ``But you have to give something to get
something.''
   What she gets is a home in a relaxed, casual community largely
free of crime, racial tension and air pollution. ``I like to be
able to see the stars at night,'' she says.
   Ms. McKeon works four 10-hour days a week managing a law office.
``On Monday I feel great,'' she says. ``On Thursday I feel like
hell.''
   In winter, she must leave an hour earlier _ 4 a.m. ``You never
know if there'll be snow in the pass,'' she explains.
   Wherever times are good, traffic is bad, from Route 1 near
Princeton, N.J., to Route 101 in Silicon Valley. Residents of
Orange County in Southern California must cope with ``Orange
Crush'' _ the impromptu parking lot that forms every rush hour at
the confluence of three freeways.
   The problem is the car, and the lack of alternatives to it.
   A fifth of all walks to work and a third of all public transit
trips occur in greater New York. Elsewhere, especially in the
Sunbelt metropolises, suburbia is so spread out that most people
cannot walk to most destinations. Even when distances are walkable,
there often is no sidewalk.
   The suburban motorist's view of mass transit _ useful only
insofar as it gets other drivers off the road _ is not irrational.
   As many as half of today's suburban drivers once took mass
transit; they know rail and bus routes are not flexible enough for
low-rise, decentralized areas. Areas like suburban Houston, where
secretary Nancy Keeler's trip home from work might also include
stops at her son's day care center, the supermarket, the post
office and the video store.
   When she lived in Chicago, she used to ride the bus to work and
walk almost everywhere else. Asked if she could do that now, she
just laughs.
   Nor can the subway or train replace the car. A study of office
workers near the Walnut Creek station of the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system in northern California found that only a handful used mass
transit. BART ran to the office, but not to their widely dispersed
homes.
   In New Jersey, the most suburban state, most mass transit lines
still run into New York City or Philadelphia, even though a
majority of residents now work in-state.
   For 28 years William Wright took the train from his home in
Cranford, N.J., to his office in Manhattan, a 40-minute ride. Then
his company moved to Fort Lee, N.J., two years ago, finally uniting
his home and job on the same side of the Hudson.
   But Wright, a mass transit buff, did not want to start driving.
So he commuted through Manhattan via train, subway and bus _ a
two-hour trip each way. After nine months of that, he quit his job.
   Wright's case illustrates not only the limits of mass transit,
but the tendency for jobs and homes to spread out as the suburban
metropolis expands.
   Those who can afford to live in job-rich suburbs such as Orange
County or Fairfield County, Conn., can enjoy relatively short
drives. But since these areas may have six or seven times more jobs
than residents, many workers must commute from far-flung bedroom
suburbs.
   Average one-way commuting times _ which held remarkably steady
from 1950 to 1980 _ are increasing. Exact figures must await the
1990 census, but between 1980 and 1985 the number of automobiles in
metropolitan areas increased between 10 and 15 percent, while road
capacity increased only 1 to 2 percent.
   As a result, the rush hour has expanded to include vast swaths
of the day, trapping commuters in their cars and curbing the sense
of spaciousness and freedom on which suburbia is based.
   By one estimate, each suburban car requires six parking spaces:
at home, work and church, as well as the club, the store and the
park.
   But the greatest space consumer is the home building industry,
which each year covers thousands of acres of farmland or other open
space with single family homes and yards.
   Developers in northern New Jersey are buying up Boy Scout camps
and neighborhood swimming holes; in south Florida, they have
reached the edge of the Everglades.
   Over the past few years Neal Alper has seen the drive between
his business in Miami Beach and his suburban Dade County home
stretch from 45 minutes to more than an hour. Usually, he misses
half of his son's Little League game.
   Jane Minelli is an elementary school teacher by training. But
these days, as she shuttles her two children to various schools,
lessons and appointments on the outskirts of Phoenix, she feels
more like a chauffeur. ``All I need is the uniform,'' she says.
   Architect Daniel Solomon recalls the night he was supposed to
drive from Malibu to Los Angeles International Airport but was told
by his hosts that he couldn't use the freeway. Even at 10 p.m., it
was too crowded.

   They gather at dawn, standing in small groups at bus stops or
corners, waiting for their ride. Jesse Jackson sums up their
working life in five words: ``They take the early bus.''
   They are the long distance commuters of the working class, the
thousands of city residents who haul themselves out to suburbia
because that is the only place they can get a decent job.
   Joyce Johnson, 50, lives in southeastern Atlanta and works as a
clerk at a pharmacy in a shopping center north of the city. It's a
40-minute drive, but Mrs. Johnson doesn't own a car. Instead, she
has to take a two different buses, because there is no direct
service. She rises before dawn to catch the 6:30 bus to be sure of
arriving on time for the store's 8 a.m. opening.
   Although the number of vehicles on the roads of greater Atlanta
has doubled in the past five years, commuting times have remained
fairly constant because employers have moved closer to suburban
residents.
   ``That don't help me,'' she sighs.
   Even exclusive old railroad suburbs had areas near the station
where servants and other workers could live. But in an attempt to
secure privacy and security in an increasingly dense suburban
fabric, many expensive new residential communities and the most
prosperous business centers are built out of reach of those most in
need of housing and jobs.
   Many new suburbs are designed to make sure residents live only
with other people like themselves. In a sort of residential dating
service, developers and real-estate agents match elderly with
elderly, singles with singles, families with families, tennis
players with tennis players.
   Since there is no place for the poor and inadequate public
transportation, these communities lack hands to flip burgers, mow
lawns, wash cars. This labor shortage is advertised in a million
store windows: ``Help Wanted.''
   Some communities drop all pretenses of pluralism and resort to
walls, gates and moats.
   Last year residents of Miami Shores, Fla., voted to raise
property taxes to barricade the community to through traffic and,
hopefully, criminals. An even more extreme example is Atlantis, a
walled, gated and guarded community in Palm Beach County that hired
a former Secret Service agent as its manager.
   But money is the most effective barrier to suburbia; a
single-family home is becoming so expensive that even the children
of the middle class are finding admission prohibitive.
   Suburbs designed to solve the housing problem now are part of
it. When William Levitt began building the first of 17,000 houses
on Long Island in 1948, the nation faced the worst housing shortage
before or since.
   GIs _ men who saved the nation from Hitler, only to find
themselves sleeping on in-laws' couches, under cars and in chicken
coops _ lined up overnight to buy houses for $65 a month and
nothing down.
   Today, the federal subsidies that built Levittown are gone, and
the town's average house price (around $160,000) is low only in
comparison to prices in other New York suburbs.
   When Daphyne Rus and her family moved to Levittown in 1959, they
were able to get a three-bedroom house with only $400 down. But
when her own son was ready to move out years later, he had to rent
a room from her for several years before he could afford a place of
his own.
   ``Levittown was very good to us,'' says Mrs. Rus. ``I really
feel for young people today. They need another Levitt.''

<DATELINE>TEANECK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The real estate agent told George Powell
that the owner of the four-bedroom, two-bath house on which he had
made a bid was taking it off the market.
   Powell, a Philip Morris executive with a wife and three
children, was suspicious for two reasons: he was black and the
owner was dead.
   Welcome to the suburbs, Mr. Powell.
   But George Powell was the exception _ he fought back. He sued
the real estate agent, a local open-housing group picketed outside
the house, and finally the Powells became Teaneck residents.
   That was 20 years ago. Today, Powell still is exceptional: he
lives on an integrated street in an integrated suburban community _
an environment still beyond the reach of most black Americans.
   The exclusion of blacks was part of the foundation of American
suburbia. Leases for houses at Levittown, N.Y., the largest and
most famous post-war suburb, limited occupants to ``members of the
Caucasian race.''
   If he sold to blacks, William Levitt insisted, whites wouldn't
buy. ``It was a question of economics,'' he later said. ``We can't
take on the functions of the government.''
   Although 12 percent of Americans are black, only six percent of
suburbanites are black.
   But between 1970 and 1980, the last decade for which statistics
are available, the black share of suburban population increased 40
percent. Some of the nation's most famous suburbs _ including Oak
Park and Park Forest, Ill., and Shaker Heights, Ohio _ have growing
black communities.
   Purdue sociologist John Stahura says blacks ``are suburbanizing
at a faster pace than whites. There's a pent-up black demand for
suburban housing.''
   However, Stahura says most blacks wind up in older, larger and
poorer ``inner-ring'' communities that often seem more urban than
suburban. An extreme example is Ford Heights, a predominantly black
community of 5,300 south of Chicago.
   Ford Heights always was more industrial than residential, and
when industry left, unemployment soared over 50 percent. An annual
per capita income of $4,943 makes Ford Heights the nation's poorest
suburb, according to one survey.
   The town has sought to attract the kinds of employers most
suburbs fight to keep out: a fireworks factory, a state prison, a
garbage incinerator.
   Despite such poverty pockets, suburban blacks generally enjoy a
higher standard of living than their city counterparts. There is
one constant, however: segregation.
   Block-by-block studies have shown that suburbs are just as
segregated as central cities. Twenty-five of the nation's 300
largest metro areas contain about three-fifths of all black
suburbanites.
   Moreover, history suggests that an ``integrated'' suburb is
really an all-white suburb in the process of becoming an all-black
suburb.
   Although Oak Park and Shaker Heights have devised intricate
strategies to maintain a racial balance, they are doomed to fail,
Stahura predicts. Both, he says, are surrounded by predominantly
black communities and will become black, middle-class communities
themselves.
   So far this has not happened in Teaneck, a town of 37,000 near
the bridge that links northern New Jersey and New York City. The
median house price is around $260,000 and the racial mix (64
percent white, 24 percent black, the rest Asian, Hispanic and
others) approximates that of greater New York.
   Teaneck prides itself on its racial and ethnic diversity. A
former mayor, who is black, calls it a ``community of
communities.'' This tradition dates at least to 1954, when the Army
designated Teaneck _ which had several black families _ as a model
town worthy of emulation by the subjugated Germans and Japanese.
   When increasing numbers of blacks started moving into the
northeastern corner, some white homeowners sold quickly. But other
whites rallied. They posted ``Not For Sale'' signs and passed an
ordinance to stop real estate agents from stampeding homeowners
into selling. In 1964 Teaneck became the first community in the
nation to use busing to voluntarily integrate its schools.
   But even in Teaneck, there is a limit to integration.
   George Powell says he often finds himself the only black at a
wedding or funeral, and his contact with most of his neighbors
extends only to an occasional wave.
   ``There is educational integration and there is residential
integration but there isn't social integration,'' he says.
   ``There are two separate societies,'' he adds. ``It's a matter
of choice. The races work together and live together, but don't
play together.''

   This final part of the series ``Suburbs: Crisis
of Growth'' looks to the suburban future, where some see less
sprawl and fewer cars.

<DATELINE>RESTON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty years ago Robert E. Simon was just
another frustrated commuter with an old American dream: to live and
work in a place with the spark of the city and the spirit of the
country.
   This frustrated commuter, however, was also the owner of
Carnegie Hall. So he sold it, and used some of the proceeds to buy
a farm 20 miles west of Washington. Here, in 1962, he started to
build his rebuttal to the web of highways, houses and shopping
centers that had begun to cover Fairfax County, Va., and much of
the rest of America.
   Reston _ its name derived from Simon's initials _ was designed
to recreate the excitement and diversity of Manhattan's 57th Street
in a peaceful, bucolic setting.
   But instead of changing the sprawling suburban landscape, Reston
became part of it. It was a community of 50,000 with lots of trees,
homes and playgrounds, offices and stores, and streets with names
like ``Gallant Fox Court,'' but little urbanity and no center.
   Now, drawing on an unexecuted part of Simon's original plan, the
nation's most famous ``new town'' is finally getting a downtown. A
real urban core, complete with a grid of streets and sidewalks, a
public square and office buildings, is being carved out of the
woods.
   The same notion is catching on across the nation: replace or at
least modify suburban sprawl with compact, walkable settlements
that mix homes and businesses in a way that gets people out of
their cars and back in touch with each other.
   This comes at a time when residents of many of the nation's most
affluent suburban areas are revolting against growth.
   Fairfax County, for instance, has more offices and stores than
most major cities. But success has been accompanied by a feeling
that paradise is getting too crowded; pro-development officials
have been voted out, and in neighboring Loudon County the most
popular bumper sticker is ``Don't Fairfax Loudon.''
   The obvious solution _ no growth or at least slower growth _ has
been popular wherever suburbia's economic boom threatens the clean,
quiet, spacious life that attracted people in the first place.
   These well-intentioned movements have just one flaw, according
to UCal-Riverside political scientist Max Neiman: they don't work.
Developers always find another community that wants the business,
and sometimes it's the one next door.
   Is there no alternative to more sprawl and traffic?
   No _ commuters might as well make the best of the inevitable,
urges Anthony Downs of the Brookings Institution. Get a
comfortable, air-conditioned car, and equip it with a stereo radio,
tape deck, telephone and dictaphone. Share your long ride with
someone you really like.
   His point: as long as people live in houses with big yards and
drive long distances alone to work, traffic congestion will be the
only way to ``reconcile the competing desires of thousands of
people to travel to the same destinations, over the same roads, at
the same time.''
   A rival scheme _ build more roads _ has an undeniable logic. But
widening congested highways often produces nothing more than wider
congested highways. And who will pay for them? The federally
financed interstate highway system is 98 percent built, and
Congress has not approved any additions to it in eight years.
   That leaves the third alternative: build new suburbs like old
towns.
   ``The newest idea in planning,'' Miami architect Andres Duany is
fond of saying, ``is the 19th century town.''
   When asked if they would prefer to live in a city, suburb, farm
or small town, Americans invariably choose the latter. Duany plays
on these fond, if hazy, impressions of small town life to sell
denser, more urbane suburbs, with tight grids of streets and
squares that bring homes, offices, stores and recreation areas
closer together.
   The 39-year-old architect sits in his office and, between sips
of strong, sweet Cuban coffee, explains where the suburbs went
wrong.
   Centuries of town planning went out of style after World War II.
Americans were tired of life in the crowded, dirty, industrial
city, and suddenly a confluence of cheap money, land, gas, cars and
highways allowed them to escape.
   Suburbia exploded in scale, to the point where in the expansive
new communities of the South and Southwest, people must climb into
a car to do almost everything, Duany says. Making matters worse,
many of these newer suburbs are designed like giant cul-de-sacs,
with only a few entrance-exits which dump all traffic onto a
through-route, creating traffic jams.
   Perhaps the best example of new town planning is Seaside, Fla.,
a resort hamlet where Duany and his architect wife, Elizabeth
Plater-Zyberk, have tried to re-create an old-fashioned Southern
community, using a strict building code.
   Their real ambition, though, is to take the elements of suburbia
_ the shopping mall, the cul-de-sac, the vast parking lot _ and
reform them in a way that will allow suburban regions to grow not
by spreading out, but by becoming more densely settled.
   The South and Southwest
have banded together to rezone their land and sell it as one parcel
to a developer, who can then tear down the homes and erect
apartment houses, stores or office buildings.
   Greater Atlanta is the neighborhood buyout capital, with more
than 40 proposed or completed. The largest occurred in the Lake
Hearn area, where a developer bought a parcel that included 140
homes, which he promptly razed. The deal went through only after
the residents won a court battle with county officials who had
refused to rezone their subdivision.
   But in Golfview's case, marvels Anthony Catanese, a University
of Florida professor who has studied neighborhood buyouts, ``An
actual government has said, `We're for sale.' That's
extraordinary.''
   So was Golfview's situation. Founded in the 1930s on part of a
golf course, Golfview was country until an adjacent strip of
asphalt called Morrison Field became Morrison Air Force Base, which
in turn became Palm Beach International Airport.
   Today Golfview finds itself encircled by noisy runways and
increasingly congested highways. There is no golf and no view,
other than the underside of 737s.
   The idea of a buyout came up four years ago at a neighborhood
cocktail party. Al Cone, a lawyer who had spent $10,000
soundproofing his house, remarked that Golfview's location had
lowered its residential value, but increased its commercial value.
   After months of discussion, homeowners signed an agreement to
sell their 64 acres en masse to a developer, and the town council
promised to rezone the property. A real estate firm was retained to
market the town, and sales brochures were printed to advertise a
``strategic location at the northwest corner'' of the airport.
   The homeowners are asking $35 million, which would pay them at
least two times the residential market value of their houses, which
ranges from $150,000 to $300,000. The proceeds will be divided up
through a complicated formula designed to reflect both the
condition of the houses and lot size.
   Where will everyone go? ``People here like their freedom and
privacy,'' says Ms. Yount, the town manager. ``They'll probably go
further west to other developments,'' with the city following
steadily behind.
   There is, however, one holdout: the elderly, nearly blind Neva
Brockway, who arrived in the 1930s, raised a family here, and says,
``I always thought I'd finish my life out here.''
   She seems resigned to moving, but her family has not signed the
agreement. Cone says they just don't want to worry her, and are
expected to cooperate when a sale date nears.
   In Florida, a state that gains about 900 new residents a day,
Golfview also offers a reminder that nothing lasts forever.
   ``I like where I live,'' says Cone, ``but everything in life is
for sale, except your honor and your health.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In any financial season, few strategies for
long-term savings have as many enthusiastic advocates as the system
known as dollar cost averaging.
   It provides for discipline and order in a chaotic world. It
takes the guesswork out of timing the ups and downs of stocks and
interest-bearing investments.
   It's especially well suited for little-by-little investors who
don't see much chance of inheriting wealth or staging their own
personal corporate takeovers any time soon.
   By a quirk of arithmetic, it allows you to buy almost any type
of readily tradeable investment at less than its average price over
a period of time. What more could anyone want?
   By all means go for it, most any expert would reply. But before
you do, recognize that even this time-honored idea isn't a certain
path to wealth.
   Dollar-cost averaging is so named because it involves regular
investments _ whether weekly, monthly, quarterly or even yearly _
of fixed amounts of money in a security such as a mutual fund.
   Suppose you decide to put $500 on the last day of each calendar
quarter into shares of the No Guts No Glory Fund, which specializes
in high-risk markets seeking maximum capital gains.
   On March 31, with the fund's net asset value per share at $25,
your $500 buys 20 shares. Three months later, when the fund stands
at $20, you add 25 shares to your account.
   On Sept. 30, with the per-share value down to $15, you purchase
33.33 shares. By yearend, the net asset value is back at $20, and
you buy another 25 shares.
   Through the year, the fund's asset value has averaged out to
$20. But because your money bought more shares at low prices, you
now own 103.33 shares which, at $20 each, are worth $2,066.60, or
$66.60 more than you paid for them.
   The longer you do this, and the greater the fluctuations in the
fund's price, the more this effect works in your favor. It demands
persistence, however, as well as faith in the fund you have chosen
and the long-term prospects for the types of securities the fund
owns.
   Dollar averaging serves as an antidote to the natural human
tendency to buy high, when everything looks rosy, and sell low,
when it looks like civilization is coming apart.
   As Christopher Downey, an analyst at Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben
Inc. in Cleveland, put it: ``Most investors who obtain poor returns
in the market are victims of their own emotions.''
   But sticking with a dollar averaging plan may not turn out to be
as easy as it looks. The more shares of No Guts No Glory you
accumulate, the more you will have to stick with your convictions
when its price declines for extended periods.
   In fact, there is always a chance that any fears you have of
throwing good money after bad may prove justified.
   If after 25 years of your averaging program the No Guts No Glory
Fund bogs down at around $1.50 a share, its operating philosophy
discredited once and for all, you may have to conclude that your
plan just hasn't worked out. A lot of the money and all of the time
you entrusted to it is gone.
   Of course, that risk exists to some degree in almost any type of
investment _ even government securities, which can be ravaged by
inflation. If dollar averaging can't make you a certain winner,
advisers say, it can certainly improve your odds.

   It's been a busy season for Julia Duffy: Her
real-life son was born in August and her fictional child arrives
Monday on CBS' ``Newhart.''
   Daniel was the second child for Duffy, the petite blonde actress
who plays self-absorbed Stephanie Vanderkellen-Harris on the comedy
series.
   The birth Monday will be the first for Stephanie and her
husband, Michael Harris, played by Peter Scolari.
   ``I've never had a baby before on a show,'' said Duffy. In the
next several weeks, she'll have two: on ``Newhart'' and in a CBS
movie, ``The Love Boat: A Valentine Voyage,'' on Feb. 11.
   ``I guess I'm typecast,'' she said.
   The entire ``Newhart'' show is built around the birth. ``When I
go into labor Michael tries to tape the birth with his video
camera. I get mad and throw him out of the delivery room,'' she
said.
   Michael does everthing in excess. Duffy explains: ``He shows up
with a 15-man news crew, all scrubbed down and wearing green
surgical gowns.''
   Duffy declined to give any details about the child, saying, ``If
you want to know the sex of the baby, tune in.'' The baby, however,
will be on view briefly in the next week's episode. The focus of
the show goes back to Bob Newhart and those at the Stratford Inn in
Norwich, Vt.
   It'll be the second birth on a CBS comedy show this year.
Charlene Frazier Stillfield, played by Jean Smart, had a daughter
on a special one-hour episode of ``Designing Women'' this past
Monday. On the show, she's married to Doug Barr, but in real life
she's married to Richard Gilliland. They had a son, Connor Douglas,
in October.
   Combining pregnancies, real and fictional, is nothing new for
television. On NBC's ``Cheers,'' Carla (Rhea Perlman) has had three
births. Jane Carr of NBC's ``Dear John'' and Anne Schedeen of NBC's
``ALF'' have also had babies on their shows to coincide with real
births.
   The most famous birth of all was that of Little Ricky on ``I
Love Lucy'' on Jan. 19, 1953. That same night Lucille Ball gave
birth to Desiderio Alberto Arnaz IV. The event nearly knocked the
inauguration of President Eisenhower off page one the next day.
   Duffy talked in her dressing room at the CBS-MTM Studios, but
her mind was on her two sick children at home. Daniel had a stomach
virus and daughter Kerry, nearly 4, had a sinus infection. Duffy is
married to actor-writer Jerry Lacy.
   This is expected to be the final season for ``Newhart,'' now in
its seventh year. But it is one of the highest-rated shows on
third-place CBS and might be invited back.
   Duffy has a development deal with CBS for her own series next
season. Should ``Newhart'' return, she can choose to continue to
remain in her role and postpone her own show.
   ``I'm not tired of Stephanie, I don't mind doing it, but I don't
want to try to squeeze every last drop,'' she said. ``I'd like to
leave the audience wanting more.
   ``I'm looking at a lot of ideas for a half-hour comedy show. I
have my own ideas, but mostly about the kind of character I want to
play. ... I want to play someone more grownup than Stephanie, but I
want someone with an edge like she has.''
   She would also like to return to doing some drama. Her previous
series, ``Wizards and Warriors,'' in which she played a spoiled
princess, was also a comedy. She has played dramatic roles in such
movies as ``Night Warning,'' ``Cutter's Way'' and ``Battle Beyond
the Stars,'' the miniseries ``The Blue and the Gray'' and various
TV series and movies. She was on two soap operas, ``Love of Life''
and ``The Doctors.''
   Duffy and her husband appear together in ``The Love Boat: A
Valentine Voyage.''
   ``We play expectant parents,'' she said. ``He's a chef on the
ship and I come along to be with him. Of course, we have the baby
on the ship. I was seven months pregnant when we took the cruise to
the Caribbean. The cruise was the enticement to do the role. I took
my mom and daughter.''

   SOAP ANNIVERSARY _ ABC's ``All My Children'' celebrates its 20th
anniversary on Friday. It began on Jan. 5, 1970, and creator Agnes
Nixon was the first daytime writer to acknowledge the Vietnam War
when one of its characters was drafted and sent to Southeast Asia.
His mother, played by Mary Fickett, gave an impassioned anti-war
speech and earned the first Emmy award given to a daytime

   Weakness persisted in the manufacturing sector
during December but the pace of economic decline eased, the
nation's purchasing managers reported.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks
economic trends by polling its members each month, said Tuesday its
index rose to 48 percent in December from 46.6 percent in November.
   Despite the unexpectedly big improvement in the widely followed

   Construction spending hit a 10-month high in
November, the government reported, and an analyst attributed the
jump to lower interest rates and to rebuilding after Hurricane Hugo
and the San Francisco Bay-area earthquake.
   ``I think a reasonable argument can be made that some of the
government spending was disaster-related,'' David Berson, chief
economist for the Federal National Mortgage Corp., said Tuesday.
   A 7 percent gain in government spending helped push total
outlays up 1.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$421.7 billion, the Commerce Department said.

<HEAD>Airline Passengers Group Praises Northwest For Bomb Warning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An airline passengers group has praised
Northwest Airlines for acknowledging a bomb threat last week and
giving passengers the option of canceling their reservations.
   More than 100 travelers gave up bookings on Saturday's Flight 51
from Paris to Detroit. The DC-10, with a capacity of 284
passengers, arrived safely in Detroit with 22 passengers on board.
   The Virginia-based Airline Passengers Association wrote
Northwest President Alfred Checchi to ``express appreciation and
support'' for the airlines' decision to publicly discuss the threat
and give passengers the option of taking other flights, said
association head Richard Livingston.
   ``We just felt that the action by Northwest was a refreshing
change of attitude on the part of the industry,'' Livingston said
Tuesday.
   The independent consumers group, funded by its 110,000
frequent-flyer members, believes passengers have a right to know of
any credible threat against planes for which they have
reservations, he said.
   The Northwest threat, acknowledged by the airline after a
Swedish newspaper reported it, led to increased security on the
flight and several others in Europe over the weekend.
   Livingston said the airline's decision to acknowledge the threat
two days before the flight gave passengers the opportunity to make
other plans. Other security threats have been disclosed only as
passengers are about to board the plane, he said.
   The airline allowed passengers to make other reservations
without penalty, even if they held discount tickets with refund and
flight-change restrictions.

<HEAD>IBM To Announce New PC for Mobile Satellite Uses, Research Group
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. will
announce this year a new personal computer system for use in
trucks, aircraft, ships and cars for mobile satellite
communications, an industry research company said.
   IBM declined to comment on the report Tuesday by Gartner Group
Inc., said IBM spokesman James Keller.
   ``IBM sees this market as one of the great growth areas for
PCs,'' said Gartner analyst John Pemberton.
   Gartner predicts that sales of computers for use in mobile
satellite operations will reach $4 billion in 1995, compared with
$50 million in 1989.
   Such a level of compound annual growth, 150 percent, would
exceed the more than 50 percent growth rate of personal computers
from 1981 to 1986, said Gartner, which is based in Stamford, Conn.
   ``Almost any industry needs MSS (mobile satellite systems) to
control field operations for constant location and status
information on trucks, trains, airplanes, oil rigs and piplines,''
Pemberton said in a statement.
   The recent development of small mobile satellite stations
costing only $4,000 makes satellite communications systems
affordable for wide use, Gartner says. Previously, the least
expensive satellite terminals cost $15,000 or more.
   With a satellite system, a delivery company, for example, could
receive information directly from its truck drivers on pickups,
traffic delays, etc., without the need for drivers to stop to make
a phone call. Such information would be entered into a personal
computer housed in the truck.
   Gartner said the new computers will be used with Radio
Determination Satellite Services, a mobile satellite system
produced by Geostar Corp. of Washington, D.C. Geostar has a
business partnership with IBM.

   Bank lenders for Campeau Corp.'s department
stores have offered a stopgap measure by agreeing to wait two weeks
before deciding whether the stores are in default in $2.34 billion
in loans.
   A group of banks led by Citibank of New York have agreed to wait
until Jan. 15 before trying to enforce their contention that
Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp.
are in default, the retailers said Tuesday.
   Federated said that under the agreement it would prepay a $250
million loan due April 30. Allied, in a separate statement, said it
would have members of a committee considering Campeau's
restructuring meet with bankers by Jan. 11.
   ``What it means to me is that the bankers are essentially giving
Allied and Federated two more weeks of grace to satisfy some very
stringent conditions,'' said analyst Janet Mangano of Josephthal &amp;
Co., a New York brokerage.
   ``The bankers can come knocking at their doors two weeks from
now'' to demand repayment, Ms. Mangano said.
   Citibank warned Dec. 21 that it considered Federated and Allied
in technical default on $2.34 billion owed to the lenders. Citibank
said the banks would consider demanding early repayment unless the
Cincinnati-based retailers could prove solvency by Dec. 31.
   Federated and Allied disagreed with the banks over whether they
were in default on the loans. The agreement announced Tuesday
preserves the banks' right to assert default while Campeau
maintains the right to contest that a default exists.
   Toronto-based Campeau, which owns 258 stores, took on heavy debt
during the 1988 purchase of Federated for $6.7 billion. Its stores
are considered profitable, but much of Campeau's debt is in
high-interest junk bonds.
   Federated said it would repay its loan with money from an
account that was part of a mortgage agreement. The account would be
replenished by any possible asset sales, Federated said.
   Federated has been trying since last year to sell its upscale
Bloomingdale's chain to raise cash.
   Allied, which Campeau bought in 1986, hasn't offered to sell any
assets or promised to take any other actions, said Dixie Barker, a
Campeau spokeswoman.
   ``Nothing is active at this point,'' Ms. Barker said. ``There's
nothing going on right now other than the Bloomingdale asset sale.''
   Allied and Federated warned in a Dec. 12 filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that they may be forced to file
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy
code if lenders do not reschedule their debt.
   Many of Campeau's suppliers have said they won't ship spring
merchandise to Campeau's stores until the company's financial
situation improves. Spring merchandise isn't scheduled to be
shipped until about Jan. 10, suppliers say.
   Federated reported that it lost $70.6 million for the quarter
ended Oct. 28, and Allied reported a $36.2 million loss for the
same period.
   Campeau's main creditor, Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. in
Toronto, has been negotiating with the company's bondholders to try
to reduce interest payments on the bonds.
   Federated's retailing divisions are Abraham &amp; Strauss,
Bloomingdale's, Burdines, Lazarus, and Rich's.
   Allied's divisions are Jordan Marsh, Stern's, Maas, Jordan Marsh
Florida, and The Bon Marche.

   Car and truck sales took another tumble in
mid-December, falling 18.6 percent from a busy selling period a
year before, automakers say.
   Consumers stormed showrooms at the end of 1988 to take advantage
of attractive incentive packages. That raid pushed mid- and
late-December vehicle sales rates to among the highest of 1988,
making year-to-year comparisons difficult.
   However, analysts said the market slump that began in October
continued into mid-December of 1989.
   The eight major automakers with U.S. plants said Tuesday they
sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 28,417
during the Dec. 11-20 period last year, compared with a rate of
34,921 during the same time the year before.
   Car sales were down 21.3 percent and sales of light trucks fell
14 percent.
   Incentives were in effect during the month in 1989, but they
weren't working the same kind of charm as they did a year earlier.
   ``The problem is you've got a tired market,'' said auto analyst
Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
``You're facing a market that's at least partially saturated.''
   Since 1985, more than 77 million new cars and trucks have been
sold in the United States, or about one for every three Americans.
   ``They've bought so many cars over the past five or six years
and they are still paying for them,'' said analyst Mary Anne Sudol
of Fitch Investors Service Inc. in New York.
   It was difficult Tuesday to pinpoint how much of the
year-to-year decline in mid-December sales figures was due to
industry weakness and how much was colored by the hefty sales
figures during the period in 1988.
   ``I think it's pretty weak right now,'' Sudol said.
   With just one 10-day sales period left in 1989, car and truck
sales for the eight automakers were running 3.7 percent behind the
pace in 1988. Domestic and overseas automakers report their
end-of-the-year sales figures Thursday.
   Car sales for 1989 through Dec. 20 were running 4.8 percent
behind 1988's level and truck sales were down 1.6 percent.
   Among the Big Three, Ford's mid-December combined car and truck
sales dropped the most, falling 25.2 percent from a year ago.
Ford's car sales were off 33.2 percent and light truck sales were
down 12.2 percent.
   Chrysler's vehicle sales for mid-December were down 22.8
percent, with car sales falling 33.7 percent and light truck sales
dropping 11.3 percent.
   At GM, car and truck sales fell 19.5 percent in mid-December
last year compared with a year ago. Car sales fell 21.6 percent and
truck sales were down 15.3 percent.

   The dollar was mixed against major foreign
currencies today in moderate European trading, dealers said.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Trading remained thin after the holidays, observers said, and
they were uncertain whether the dollar would continue Tuesday's
one-day rise after an extended decline in the last weeks of 1989.
   Jens-Uwe Fischer, senior trader at Manufacturers Hanover in
Frankfurt, said he expected relatively quiet trading until next
week when many vacationing traders return to work.
   Others said the market would remain somewhat subdued until the
release of U.S. December unemployment figures on Friday.
   Dealers in Milan reported profit-taking from Tuesday's gains.
   ``There are some doubts about the U.S. economy, so people
decided to take profits,'' one said.
   In Tokyo, the New Year's holiday continued with markets closed
today. In London, the yen was quoted at 145.75 yen compared with
Tuesday's London figure of 144.09.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.7137 West German marks, up from 1.7090; 1.5712
Swiss francs, down from 1.5715; 5.8510 French francs, up from
5.8335; 1.9405 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9130; 1,284.70 Italian
lire, down from 1,269.00; 1.1620 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1604.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6120 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6115 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $396.60 a troy ounce,
down from $400.75 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $396.30.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $396.50, compared with $401.00 on
Friday. The Zurich markets were closed Monday and Tuesday for
public holidays.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell $5.96 to close at a bid $396.29.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.18 a troy ounce, down
from Tuesday's $5.25.

Northern's refusal to cooperate with its $3.8 billion tender offer.
   Great Northern received the package from Georgia-Pacific late
Tuesday, said Stephen M. Hill, the company's director of investor
relations.
   ``It says it is a call for a meeting,'' Hill said from the
company's Norwalk, Conn., headquarters. ``We'll be reviewing it
with our attorneys, to make sure it's valid. If it is, our
directors will proceed appropriately.''
   Hill noted that Great Northern has 15 days to set a date for
such a meeting.
   ``Our response to our shareholders is, we'll take a look at it
tomorrow,'' Hill said late Tuesday afternoon.
   Georgia-Pacific said the primary purpose of the special
shareholders meeting would be to consider ``the removal of
impediments'' to its $63-a-share cash offer, ``including removal of
the entire current board of directors and election of a slate of
Georgia-Pacific nominees.''
   ``The response of Great Northern's shareholders to our call
solicitation is remarkable,'' said Georgia-Pacific Chairman T.
Marshall Hahn Jr., who said that separately, more than 73 percent
of Great Northern's shares have now been tendered to
Georgia-Pacific.
   ``Shareholders have clearly shown that they want the opportunity
to consider the removal of Great Northern's current board, so as to
be able to consider for themselves the merits of our offer,'' Hahn
said.
   Great Northern is in federal court in Connecticut seeking an
injunction to halt the tender offer, on the grounds that it would
run afoul of U.S. antitrust law. The company has maintained that a
merged Georgia-Pacific@Great Northern would have the buying power
to drive down wood prices in the pulpwood country of Mississippi.

<HEAD>Ford Plants Tops, Survey Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. is the most productive of the Big
Three U.S. automakers, using fewer workers to make one car,
according to an automotive survey.
   Harbour &amp; Associates Inc. of Troy, Mich., which conducted the
study released Tuesday, ranked North American car and truck
assembly plants by the number of workers needed to make one
automobile a day. It compared productivity in 1979 and 1988.
   Among the Big Three automakers, Ford's productivity rose the
most, while General Motors Corp.'s rose the least. Ford showed a 31
percent gain between the two periods and Chrysler Corp. was second
with a 17 percent increase. GM's productivity rose 5 percent.
   Among the 37 car plants surveyed, Ford factories held the top
three positions and GM plants held the bottom three, the survey
said.
   The top-rated plant, according to the survey, was Ford's Atlanta
factory, where Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars are made. There,
2.72 workers were needed to build a car.
   The least efficient was GM's plant in the Detroit enclave of
Hamtramck, where the Cadillac Eldorado and Seville and Buick
Riviera and Toronado cars are made. It employs 7.85 workers for
every car assembled there, the survey said.
   GM spokesman John Mueller said much of what is contained in the
Harbour report confirms internal GM studies. He also said the
company is continuing a multibillion dollar cost-cutting program,
designed to slash $12.5 billion to $13 billion in costs between
1987 and 1990.
   Ford spokesman Jay Meisenhelder said the nation's No. 2
automaker is ``glad that our efforts to improve productivity have
gotten some recognition from an outside authority.''
   Chrysler spokesman Alan Miller didn't return telephone calls.
Company executives in October began a program to trim $1.5 billion
from Chrysler's $26 billion annual budget by the end of this year.
The program includes eliminating about 2,300, or 8 percent, of the
automaker's salaried positions.

<HEAD>Japanese Business Leaders Urge Steps to Improve U.S.-Japan Ties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 70 percent of Japanese business leaders
polled last month said U.S.-Japan relations would deteriorate
unless measures were taken now, a major Japanese newspaper reported
Wednesday.
   When the 100 executives in the poll were asked to suggest two
remedies, more than 90 percent mentioned boosting Japanese domestic
demand and narrowing the U.S. trade deficit, said the nationally
circulated Mainichi Shimbun. Higher domestic demand here means
Japanese would buy more foreign products and rely less on exports
for economic growth.
   The paper said 23 percent felt the imbalance could be solved by
making the yen higher against the U.S. dollar, which makes U.S.
goods less expensive here and Japanese goods costlier in the United
States.
   Among the 100 executives interviewed between Dec. 6 and 26 were
Sony President Norio Oga, Yutaka Kume of Nissan Motor Co. and
Hiroshi Saito of Japan Steel, the paper said. In publishing their
comments, however, it identified the speaker only by industry, and
not by name.
   It said 73 warned of relations worsening unless remedial steps
are taken.
   If U.S.-Soviet relations improve, the United States will be
harder on Japan and ``Japan-bashing'' will worsen, unidentified
real estate and textile executives were quoted as saying.
   A securities firm president told the Mainichi that Japan should
open its doors to encourage foreign companies' direct investment
here.
   But the paper quoted an auto company president as saying, ``To
be honest, it is almost impossible to correct the U.S.-Japan trade
imbalances.''
   A real estate company president said the imbalance would shrink
by itself in the long run if the two sides strengthened their
cooperation.
   Asked what Japanese companies should do to avoid friction in
investment in the United States, 82 executives said companies would
have to study each case because in many cases Japanese investment
is welcomed.
   Last year, the Japanese became the No. 2 foreign investor behind
the British in the United States, and some purchases, such as
Rockefeller Center by Mitsubishi Estate Co. and the Columbia film
studios by Sony, upset Americans.

   The morning Bridgeport Telegram and

   The new paper will be called The Bridgeport Post, the
newspapers' publisher, Dudley B. Thomas, said Tuesday.
   ``The national trend is to morning newspapers and our market is
following suit,'' he said.
   Thomas said there will be no reduction in editorial staff when
the papers are merged. The publisher said he hoped the
consolidation would take effect during the spring, although a

   The newspapers have a combined daily circulation of about 80,000

<HEAD>Tokyu Department Store Not Interested in Bloomingdale's</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Tokyu is correct name of store.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Tokyu Department Store said Wednesday it
has decided not to join in a proposed management buyout of the
well-known U.S. department store chain Bloomingdale's.
   The decision came late last year after a series of studies and
contacts with Bloomingdale's, said a Tokyu official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. He added that ``Tokyu has been in agreement
with Bloomingdale's not to give out details'' concerning the buyout
proposal and negotiations.
   The New York-based Bloomingdale's is owned by heavily indebted
Campeau Corp., a Canadian retail and real estate company that owns
strings of department store chains in the United States. Campeau
put the 17-store Bloomingdale's chain on the auction block in
September as part of a restructuring plan to cope with a financial
crisis.
   In November, Bloomingdale's chairman Marvin Traub visited Tokyo
and said he had been negotiating with four Japanese groups about
backing the management buyout. He did not identify the four.
   The Hankyu Department Store, based in Osaka, western Japan, has
said it turned down an offer from Traub earlier.
   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic newspaper,
reported that Traub had asked Hankyu to finance $250 million of the
$1.2 billion to $1.3 billion needed for the buyout.
   Campeau has said the list of interested parties has been
narrowed to about a half dozen and that an announcement on the sale
of Bloomingdale's would be made sometime in February.
   The nationally circulated English-language newspaper Asahi
Evening News said Tokyu decided not to join in the proposed buyout
because the price sought by Campeau was too high considering
Bloomingdale's declining business performance.
   ``Tokyu would have to spend about $200 million to return the
store to a sound financial position in addition to the purchase
price,'' Asahi quoted unidentified sources in the Japanese company
as saying.
   Campeau has debts in high interest bearing ``junk bonds'' that
were sold to finance the 1988 $6.7 billion takeover of Federated
Department Stores Inc., parent of Bloomingdale's.
   Its Allied Stores Corp. and Federated divisions, both based in
Cincinnati, had warned in a Dec. 12 filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission that they might have to seek protection
from creditors in Bankruptcy Court if lenders did not reschedule
their junk-bond debt.
   On Tuesday, the retailers received a two-week reprieve from a
bank lenders who had threatened to declare Allied and Federated in
technical default on loans of $2.34 billion and to demand full
repayment.
   The banking syndicate led by Citibank agreed not to enforce the
default assertion before Jan. 15, giving Campeau more time to show
it is making progress in sorting out its financial problems.
   Unlike their counterparts in the United States, where retailing
has been in the doldrums and a number of famous department store
chains are for sale, Japanese department stores have been growing
steadily as consumers' buying power increases.

   The stock market was mixed today, running into
increased resistance after starting 1990 with a rise to record
highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.13 to 2,808.02
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 552 up, 423 down and
507 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 33.26 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market's sharp rise Tuesday in the first session of the new
year featured strength in many stocks that had fared poorly in the
waning stages of 1989.
   Analysts said that betokened a lifting of the pressure of
yearend tax selling.
   But many investors seemed reluctant to chase after stocks today,
given persistent worries about the outlook for the economy and
corporate earnings.
   In the minds of many observers, stocks of many companies still
represent a risky bet that business activity and earnings growth
will begin to recover later this year from the slump that set in
several months ago.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Merck rose ~ to 79{;
International Business Machines gained | to 98|; Ford Motor added \

General Electric was down &rsqb; at 66&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .24 to 197.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .42 at 381.95.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average soared 56.95 points
to a record high of 2,810.15.
   Advancing issues outdistanced decliners by more than 3 to 1 on
the NYSE, with 1,254 rising, 404 falling and 333 unchanged.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jeffrey B. Lane, recently removed as president
and chief operating officer of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., has
resigned from the securities firm, the company acknowledged today.
   The departure of the 47-year-old Lane, effective Dec. 29, caps a
major shakeup at the company that has included the reshuffling of
management and a $900 million recapitalization plan.
   Lane, who had been Shearson's No. 2 executive running the
day-to-day operations of the firm, was chief operating officer
since 1984 and added the title of president in 1987 until the
reshuffling in late November, according to Shearson spokesman
Steven Faigan.
   At that time, he was reassigned to head Shearson's asset
management business, sharing power with three other executives, he
said.
   Faigan said Shearson has no current plans to name a new
president and chief operating officer. He refused to comment on
Lane's resignation, only to say he left for ``personal reasons.''
   However, in an interview in today's Wall Street Journal, Lane
conceded that many in the financial community saw him as the
scapegoat for Shearson's problems, which included slumping profits
and a threatened downgrading of its credit rating by Moody's
Investors Service Inc.
   Lane said he also was being unfairly blamed for much of the
problems at Boston Co., a money-management unit hit by a major
accounting scandal in 1988, and Balcor Co., a real estate unit that
was partly behind Shearson's problems with limited partnership
invesments.
   ``A lot of people aren't surprised I'm leaving,'' he told the
newspaper. ``(But) I feel like a great weight has been removed from
my shoulders.''
   Lane said he had no immediate future plans.
   Lane joined a Shearson predecessor, Cogan, Berlind, Weil &amp;
Levitt, in 1969 as a securities analyst and rose steadily through
the ranks until last year.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. and its engineers' union have
agreed to resume contract talks next Wednesday at a federal
mediator's urging.
   Mediator Ben Youtsey of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service said Tuesday that both sides agreed to a new meeting at his
request.
   The Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association
(SPEEA), turned down Boeing's three-year contract offer on Dec. 18
but did not sanction a strike.
   Boeing had offered 15,000 engineers a 3 percent general wage
increase and a 10 percent bonus in the first year, but no wage
increase or bonuses in the second or third year. It also offered
some merit-based wage increases.
   The engineers voted 69 percent to turn the offer down, but only
48 percent said they would be willing to strike.
   Many engineers noted the offer was not equal to the package
given to Boeing machinists following their seven-week strike in
November or to the offer made to SPEEA's bargaining unit for
technicians. The technicians approved their contract by 65 percent.
   It was the first time since SPEEA was founded in 1945 that the
engineers rejected a contract offer. The engineers have never
struck the company.
   ``There's not an awful lot to talk about; money is the issue,''
said SPEEA spokesman Dan Mahoney.
   He declined to speculate on the likelihood of a strike.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder did not comment Tuesday on whether
Boeing would offer the engineers more money.

   A mustachioed ship's officer stuck to
his guns and was fired by the Disney Co. from his bridge station on
the Queen Mary for refusing to shave off the tuft of fluff he's
sported for more than 40 years.
   Disney, which operates the Queen Mary tourist attraction in Long
Beach Harbor, gave First Officer John Magness the ultimatum in
December.
   When the deadline passed Tuesday, Magness, a 65-year-old Navy
veteran who was the regal luxury liner's No. 3 officer, still had
the mustache and was fired. Three lower-ranking employees also were
dismissed in past weeks for refusing to shave off their mustaches.
   Disney has ordered employees at the Queen Mary and nearby Spruce
Goose tourist attractions, which it has operated for about two
years, to comply with 35-year-old company grooming rules. The rules
also forbid women to wear heavy makeup, red fingernail polish or
too much jewelry.
   Detractors of the Disney rules say they are outdated and point
to the mustache worn by Walt Disney.
   Magness' firing capped a week of suspensions and warnings
intended to give workers time to change their mind, said Queen Mary
spokesman Rich Kerlin.
   The Queen Mary is permanently docked at the harbor, 25 miles
south of Los Angeles. The Spruce Goose, a massive wooden-bodied
plane built by Howard Hughes, is set up for viewing nearby.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. is accelerating a schedule of
discussions with salaried and management workers regarding a
possible employee buyout of the company, which owns United
Airlines, according to a memo circulated today.
   In an internal statement to employees, UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf
said the change was being made in response to a Monday deadline set
by Coniston Partners, a major shareholder, for the company to
develop an employee buyout plan.
   But the rescheduled talks with workers still will begin two days
after Coniston's deadline. The discussions have been moved up to
Jan. 10 and 11 from Jan. 16 and 17, UAL said in the memo.
   A company memo circulated Tuesday said talks would be
accelerated, and one issued today specified the rescheduled dates.
   The Coniston group did not immediately return telephone calls
seeking comment on the developments.
   The investment group, which owns 11.8 percent of UAL's common
stock, said on Dec. 20 that unless the deadline for a buyout
proposal is met, Coniston will push for a recapitalization of the
company. The move likely would involve a cash dividend to
shareholders.
   UAL's stock opened sharply lower this morning on the New York
Stock Exchange and was trading $4.50 lower at $166 a share about
one hour after thhe opening.
   A $300-a-share employee buyout package put together by United's
pilots and UAL's senior management collapsed in October when bank
financing for the deal fell through.
   Since then, UAL's board has been seeking a new deal to increase
the company's stock price.

   The regulator who called for the government's
takeover of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association last April today
defended his assertion that the now-defunct thrift provided the
down payment for the sale of 1,000 acres of its own land in
violation of the law.
   Kevin O'Connell, a deputy director of the Treasury Department's
Office of Thrift Supervision, testified in U.S. District Court that
he could not specifically identify the $3.5 million, 25 percent
down payment that the government asserts Lincoln lent to Phoenix
developer Ernest C. Garcia for the $14 million purchase on March
30, 1987.
   But O'Connell asserted that the loan was linked to another $20.2
million loan that Garcia obtained from the S&amp;L on the same day to
repurchase stock he had sold over the previous two years to Tucson
Electric Power Co.
   Attorneys for Lincoln, of Irvine, Calif., and its embattled
former owner, Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr., cited
documents of wire transfers of $19.6 million from Lincoln to Tucson
Electric Power as evidence that proceeds from the stock loan were
not used for the down payment.
   O'Connell, however, cited several other transactions among
Garcia, Lincoln and the thrift's parent company, American
Continental Corp. He said his office believed the stock and land
deals were directly connected because Garcia had said so in a
deposition with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   ``I'm saying that the case is fungible (interchangeable) and
that is the basis'' of the recommendation to seize control of
Lincoln, O'Connell testified.
   ``If the down payment had not had to be made, Mr. Garcia would
have had to borrow the full $20.2 million. The same cash cannot be
identified, but that was the intent.''
   Lincoln had purchased the land just two years earlier for $3
million. The government contends that through such land sales _
many of them shams _ Lincoln was able to record phony profits that
allowed Keating and his associates to effectively loot the thrift
of federally insured deposits.
   Under federal regulations, thrifts were required to make
purchasers of land from the institution put up at least a 25
percent down payment on raw land purchases in order to record a
profit.
   Meanwhile, Garcia, a key witness for the government in its case
that Lincoln was being operated in an ``unsafe and unsound
manner,'' is refusing to testify.
   Regulators estimate taxpayers will have to pay up to $2 billion
to cover Lincoln's loss of federally insured deposits through sham
land transactions, fraud and racketeering.
   Keating, contending Lincoln was being operated soundly and in
accord with regulatory requirements, has asked U.S. District Judge
Stanley Sporkin to overturn the government's seizure of the thrift
as ``capricious and arbitrary.''
   Keating and his son, Charles H. Keating III, have been
subpoenaed as witnesses and are expected to be called to the stand
Thursday or Friday, government attorneys said Tuesday.
   The elder Keating, who is the target of a criminal grand jury
investigation in Los Angeles, cited his constitutional rights in
refusing to answer questions in a subpoenaed appearance in November
before the House Banking Committee.
   On Tuesday, the third day of a hearing in Keating's suit, his
attorneys attempted to point out gaps in the 4,000-page record that
regulators compiled to justify their takeover of Lincoln.
   O'Connell, acknowledged in cross-examination that some documents
outlining the details and regulators' approval of a tax arrangement
and the transactions between Lincoln and Garcia were omitted from
the record submitted to the three-member bank board in April.
   O'Connell testified in December that the tax-sharing arrangement
between Lincoln and its parent company, American Continental Corp.
of Phoenix, ``was illegal on its face'' and amounted to nothing
more than an interest-free loan from the thrift to its holding
company in violation of the law.
   As a loan, the government contends, American Continental would
have had to pay an estimated $20 million in interest to Lincoln.
   Using the tax agreement, the government claims, Keating and his
associates funneled $94 million in federally insured deposits out
of Lincoln as deferred taxes, much of it on phony profits from sham
land deals.
   None of the money was paid to the Internal Revenue Service and
regulators say they have been unable to recover any of it because
American Continental filed for bankruptcy reorganization a day
before Lincoln was seized.
   O'Connell testified Tuesday that a 140-page deposition Garcia
gave the Securities and Exchange Commission in March was the
``smoking gun'' that bank board attorneys wanted to justify the
takeover of Lincoln without first declaring it insolvent.
   Garcia told the SEC he used his own funds rather than Lincoln's
loan to make the down payment on the land purchase from Lincoln.
But he added, ``We never were certain whether or not we would have
gotten the financing (for the stock purchase) if we had not bought
the property.''
   Keating also is the target of a $1.1 billion federal fraud and
racketeering suit.
   Until last week, the 11 defendants in that suit also included
Keating's brother, William J. Keating, a former two-term Republican
congressman who is chief executive officer of the Detroit Newspaper
Agency and chairman of the board of directors of The Associated
Press.
   On Friday, federal attorneys dismissed charges against William
Keating, who had been accused of negligence and breach of fiduciary
duty as a board member of American Continental during 1986.

   The stock market gained more ground in active
trading today as blue chips extended Tuesday's rise to record highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 56.95 points Tuesday
to its first close above 2,800, gained another 4.05 to 2,814.20 by
noontime today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 753 up, 626 down and
448 unchanged.
   The market's sharp rise Tuesday in the first session of the new
year featured strength in many stocks that had fared poorly in the
waning stages of 1989.
   Analysts said that resulted from a lifting of the pressure of
yearend tax selling.
   But some investors seemed reluctant to chase after stocks today,
given persistent worries about the outlook for the economy and
corporate earnings.
   In the minds of many observers, stocks of many companies still
represent a risky bet that business activity and earnings growth
will begin to recover later this year from the slump that set in
several months ago.

   Munford Inc., operator of Majik Market
convenience stores, has filed for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code.
   The bankruptcy petition applies only to the 367 stores operating
under the name ``Majik Market _ A Munford Store,'' and not to the
341 Majik Markets operated by TOC Retail Inc. of Casselberry, Fla.,
the company said in a statement. The Florida company operates
independently of Munford.
   The 367 Munford-operated stores, located in 10 states, will
remain open while the petition is pending in court, the statement
said.
   In the petition, filed Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Atlanta, the company said it had assets of $44.1 million and
liabilities of $94.6 million as of Nov. 10. It said it intends to
reorganize under the leadership of the Finley Group, which it
identified as ``a crisis management firm that specializes in
corporate reorganization.''
   Wayne T. Stephens of the Finley Group will become president and
chief executive officer of Munford, the statement said. It made no
mention of Joseph F. Leonardo, who had been president.
   Munford, formerly headed by Atlanta businessman Dillard Munford,
was sold in 1988 to a group of private investors headed by F.

<HEAD>Lord Einstein Loses Its Biggest Ad Client, Saab-Scania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The advertising agency Lord, Einstein, O'Neill &amp;
Partners has lost its biggest client, Saab-Scania of America Inc.,
over what both sides describe as creative and philosophical
differences.
   ``The decision to terminate was mutually agreed upn,''
Saab-Scania spokeswoman Karin Nobile said Wednesday by telephone
from the company's offives in Orange, Conn. ``There were long-term
creative differences and differences over philosophical strategies
between both partners.''
   Saab-Scania spent an estimated $25 million on advertising
through Lord Einstien, whose total ad billings amount to about $100
million.
   But Arthur Einstein Jr., president and partner in the ad agency,
said Wednesday there were no plans to lay off any of the agency's
90-some employees due to the loss of its biggest client.
   He noted the agency would continue to service the Saab account
until the end of March, a 90-day grace period that is standard in
the advertising business.
   In addition, he said, the agency is involved in several new
business pitches that potentially could involve ad spending worth
more than the lost business.
   ``We have a lot going on around here. We are disappointed but we
are not by any means looking at the future as anything other than
bright at this agency,'' Einstein said.
   He blamed the split on ``a difference of points of view'' about
ad direction.
   In addition to being its biggest account, Saab had symbolic
significance for Lord Einstein. It was the first major account Lord
Einstein landed in the tumultous days that followed the creation of
the agency in March 1988.
   Lord Einstein had been formed by six top executives who quit
their old agency, Lord Geller Federico Einstein, in a dispute with
that agency's new owner, Britain's WPP Group PLC.
   Saab hired the new agency in April 1988 and Lord Einstein
executives frequently cited it as proof of the viability of their
new operation.
   But Lord Einstein's advertisements were unable to halt a sales
erosion that has caught not only Saab but many other European car
importers as well.
   Ms. Nobile said Saab sales in the U.S. reached 47,414 cars in
1986, but dropped 20 percent over the next two years.
   The decline continued in 1989. Sales through November 1989 were
29,869, down 14.9 percent from the first 11 months of 1988.
   Lord Einstein used Saab's long-running theme line, ``The most
intelligent cars ever built,'' in its work for Saab.
   Two print ads used the headlines ``Most car accidents happen in
a showroom'' and ``Neutral country attacks Germany and Japan.'' A
recent TV commercial used the song ``What becomes of the
broken-hearted'' and scenes from a junkyard filled with some of the
cars from Saab's competitors.

   Sales of new homes surged 9.6 percent in
November, the steepest gain in four months, the government said
today in a report showing sharp gains in every region of the nation
except the South.
   The Commerce Department said new single-family homes were sold
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 710,000 units in November
after edging up a revised 0.9 percent in October. Sales in October
originally were reported to be off 0.5 percent.
   The November gain was the highest since a 14.1 percent advance
last July. Sales had fallen 11.2 percent in September.
   Analysts have been looking for a slight improvement in new home
sales as mortgage interest rates decline. Rates were boosted
earlier this year as a result of Federal Reserve efforts to
moderate inflation by tightening credit.
   ``The market for new homes remains fixed, with both sales of
single family homes and starts of new homes fluctuating from month
to month,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. ``The
cumulative effect of lower interest rates since their peak early in
1989 suggests that the housing market may rebound somewhat in the
coming months.''
   Fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.74 percent at the end of
November, according to a survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. They had peaked at 11.22 percent last March.
   But despite the lower rates, analysts say the sluggish economy
stemming from the Fed action have made many prospective buyers
wary, particularly of higher-priced new homes.
   The Commerce Department reported that the median price of a new
home was $127,000 in November, up 3.3 percent from the revised
median price of $123,000 in October. The median is the point at
which half of the homes sold for more and half for less.
   The average price of a home was $155,900, up 5.6 percent from
October.
   The National Association of Realtors reported last week that
sales of existing single-family homes advanced 3.2 percent in
November to their highest level of the year.
   John A. Tuccillo, the association's chief economist, predicted
then that falling mortgage rates would boost home sales in coming
months as buyers take advantage of favorable financing terms.
   The median price for existing homes sold in November was
$93,000, the Realtors said.
   New home sales ran up a 29.9 percent gain in the West, the
highest rate since advancing 47.7 percent in November 1981. The
Mitsubishi Bank's Weekly Economic Indicator Report suggested the
November figure would be partially due to a rebound from abnormally
weak sales following the Oct. 10 San Francisco Bay-area earthquake.
   Sales in the Midwest registered a 23.6 percent gain, the
sharpest since rising 28.3 percent last July, while the Northeast
posted an 8.5 percent increase.
   Sales in the South, however, fell 7.6 percent after a 5.7
percent increase the previous month.
   New home sales for the first 11 months of the year were down 3.5
percent from the same period of 1988.

<HEAD>Settlement Reached in Trump's Suit Over Cards; He'll Endorse Them</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developer Donald J. Trump, whose lawyers often
are busy fighting unauthorized attempts to use his name, has agreed
to endorse a line of photographic business cards made by a small
Georgia company he had sued for calling the product ``Trump Cards.''
   Under an out-of-court settlement announced Wednesday, Trump was
given the rights to the ``Trump Cards'' trademark and will license
Positive Concepts Ltd. of Lithia Springs, Ga., to market the
product. Trump will receive a monthly royalty.
   Trump agreed to drop his suit against PCL, a suburban Atlanta
company that began making the cards in 1983. The company, whose
trademark application last year prompted Trump's lawsuit, contends
it named its product for the high-ranking suit in a card game
rather than the billionaire entrepreneur.
   PCL President Edward A. Zito said Wednesday the settlement was
beneficial to both sides. He said his company avoided a potentially
lengthy and expensive court battle and got an unusual endorsement
from Trump that should boost the fortunes of his business.
   Advertisements featuring Trump's endorsement will begin
appearing in national business magazines this spring, Zito said.
   ``We are quite honored that someone of Donald Trump's position
would give us his personal endorsement,'' Zito said. ``We couldn't
get anybody better to endorse our product, and we're not paying for
it.''
   Neither Zito nor Joe Silver, a spokesman for The Trump
Organization in New York, would say how much money Trump would
receive in royalties.
   Zito said, however, the figure was nominal to someone like Trump.
   ``Let's face facts _ he's a billionaire and we're just coming
along as a company,'' Zito said. ``What's it to him if he got five,
ten, $15,000 a year?''
   Zito said the path to the settlement began last summer when he
called Trump to discuss the suit over the cards.
   ``He was cordial but stood his ground,'' Zito said. ``I said,
`You know, we didn't try to steal your name from you. In 1983,
nobody knew of you.'''
   Zito said he followed up the call by sending Trump a sample of
the cards and suggested the issue could be settled out of court.
Trump liked the cards, Zito said, and months of negotiations began.
   ``I like your Trump Card photographic business cards and think
they have great potential. The outdated, printed business card is
long overdue for a change,'' Trump said in a letter late last month
to Zito.
   Trump, whose lawyers usually pounce on any attempt to use the
Trump name, pursued a settlement in this case because he liked the
product, Silver said.
   ``We're constantly involved in lawsuits against people trying to
trade on Mr. Trump's name, and writing cease and desist letters,''
Silver said.
   Silver said most cases end up with a permanent injunction
against use of the name by unauthorized parties. ``We haven't lost
a case,'' he said.
   But Zito maintained that he never had Donald Trump in mind when
he named his product ``Trump Cards.'' And he said he never intended
to try to land a gold mine by fighting Trump over the name.
   ``I think that's one of the things he liked ... that we didn't
want any money out of him,'' Zito said.

   HOWEY-IN-THE-HILLS, Fla. (AP) _ The Bush administration's quest
to open up export markets for farm products is bringing Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter to a Florida resort this week to meet
with foreign counterparts.
   Yeutter is to play host Thursday to top agricultural officials
from the European Community, Japan, Canada and Australia. The
meeting is billed as the first of a series of informal gatherings
to thrash out issues such as food production and safety, trade
restrictions and export subsidies.
   The 1{ days of talks are to be private.
   ``It's basically a shirtsleeve get-together with no negotiating
and no formal communique to be issued,'' said Yeutter's press
secretary, Kelly Shipp.
   Yeutter held similar meetings with foreign trade and
agricultural officials when he was this country's trade
representative.
   Among the chief topics on the table is the current round of
talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
international compact administered from Geneva; and the impact of
the 12-member European Community, which comes into being in 1992.
   The United States wants to open up markets throughout the world,
phasing out all export subsidies by the end of the century. Yeutter
has been a leader in this movement, viewing government subsidies to
producers and shippers as impediments to unrestricted world trade.
   The secretary told a Polk County citrus growers' meeting last
month that such subsidies ``pit government treasury against
government treasury'' and were indefensible.
   The U.S. proposals in the GATT negotiations are designed to turn
import restrictions into tariffs and then negotiate the tariffs
down over a period of years, Yeutter said. Some farm groups have
expressed concerns that the negotiations could leave American
farmers vulnerabe to price undercutting in foreign competition.
   The United States has entered into liberalized trade agreements
with Japan and Canada, pacts which are expected to help farmers and
other export industries in all three countries within the the next
few years. The agreements gradually phase out tariffs and other
import restrictions.
   The foreign participants are Ray MacSharry, the European
Community's commissioner of agriculture; Michihiko Kano, minister
of agriculture, forestry and fisheries in Japan; Canadian Minister
of Agriculture Donald F. Mazankowski; and John Kerin, Australia's
minister of primary industries and energy.
   The agriculture officials are not expected to meet with
representatives of any interest groups in this country, such as
Florida citrus growers or beef industry officials from midwestern
states, who have had to face some of the import restrictions
imposed by foreign governments.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, led by a rally in the
soybean market after steep losses in the previous session.
   ``The market just got tired of going down,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
``There's not a lot of fresh news. We're recovering from the
end-of-the-year doldrums.''
   Confirmation that Romania purchased 30,000 metric tons of U.S.
soybean meal may have prompted some buying, he said, although the
deal had been widely expected.
   The wheat and corn markets took back practically all of the
ground they lost Tuesday while the soybean market recovered about
two-thirds of the previous session's decline.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent to 1{ cents higher with

   Eastern Airlines announced fare cuts of up to 45
percent, but its sister carrier, Continental Airlines, said it
plans to raise fares 4 percent because of the surging cost of jet
fuel.
   Eastern, striving to rebuild as a smaller carrier after a strike
and bankruptcy filing, sweetened the fare discounts announced
Tuesday by eliminating the usual cancellation penalties.
   Following Continental's move, Northwest Airlines announced later
in the day it will add a $6 fuel surcharge each way to the price of
domestic tickets, starting Jan. 10. The airline also said it is
applying for foreign government approval of the surcharge for its
international flights.
   Trans World Airlines said today it will impose a fuel surcharge
ranging from $5 to $20 per ticket depending on flight length, also
effective Jan. 10. TWA spokesman Don Morrison in St. Louis, Mo.,
said the charge represents about 4 percent of an average ticket
price.
   TWA also said it will follow Eastern's fare discounts, but only
on flights to Florida and without eliminating cancellation
penalties. The new TWA fares are good through Feb. 9, compared with
Eastern's limit of May 1.
   Midway Airlines said today it is matching Eastern's fare cuts in
the two markets where the carriers compete, Chicago-Miami and
Chicago-Atlanta. The fares are available through May 1. Tickets are
non-refundable but changes are allowed without penalties, said
spokeswoman Sandra Allen in Chicago.
   It wasn't immediately clear whether other major airlines would
match the fare changes by either Eastern or Continental, both owned
by Houston-based Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline
company. Competitors said they were studying the moves.
   Last Friday, several airlines said they were considering ticket
surcharges to help cover the cost of jet fuel, which has jumped to
around $1 a gallon from 64 cents at the end of October. Oil prices
have been boosted in recent weeks by the record-setting cold snap
and refinery problems in Texas and Louisiana.
   Art Kent, a spokesman for Continental, said that airline decided
on a fare hike rather than a special fuel surcharge because ``it
was simpler.''
   The fare increase follows a discounting move by the nation's big
carriers last week, when they lowered fares as much as 30 percent
in selected markets to lure passengers during the slow winter
months. Those fare reductions, in effect through early March, only
apply to about 10 percent of the airlines' route networks but
involve densely traveled routes.
   Eastern's cheaper fares announced Tuesday are available for
round-trip travel from Jan. 9 through May 1, excluding holidays.
They require a minimum stay of two nights and must be purchased
seven days in advance, although Eastern is waiving the
advance-purchase requirement for travel from Jan. 9-23.
   In addition, the tickets are fully refundable and may be changed
without penalty, an unusual departure from the strict
no-cancellation clauses in other discount airline ticket policies.
The fares are aimed at vacationers, who have greater flexibility in
travel plans than business fliers.
   ``Our `Anywhere' fares are up to 45 percent below the current
industry MaxSaver levels,'' George Brennan, Eastern's vice
president for marketing, told a New York news conference.
   Between New York and Miami, for example, the new fares are
$79-$99 each way, depending on the day of travel, compared with
$149-$169 before the discounts. Fares between Atlanta and
Washington were cut to $69-$89 each way from $109-$129.
   ``Domestic travel in the United States is flat; it's in a
stall,'' Brennan said. ``Our objective is clearly to stimulate
discretionary travel ... we're looking to generate revenue.''
   On average, Brennan said, about 50 percent of the seats on each
flight will be available at the new fares, with up to 85 percent to
90 percent availability on some flights.
   Despite its new discounts, Eastern isn't ruling out a fuel
price-related increase like that announced by Continental.
   ``We're aware of the economic realities facing the industry. We
are not ruling out the possibility of a (fuel) surcharge at this
time,'' said Eastern spokesman Robin Matell at the airline's
headquarters in Miami.
   Eastern has been in bankruptcy reorganization since last March,
when members of the Machinists union struck the airline in a wage
dispute and pilots and flight attendants walked out in sympathy.
The airline has hired replacement workers and is reshaping itself
at about two-thirds its pre-strike size, moving its hub from Miami
to Atlanta.
   Brennan said Eastern hopes to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings
early this year.
   ``We don't have a specific date set yet,'' he said.
   Last Thursday, Eastern said it plans 600 more layoffs along with
salary cuts for half its 20,000 employees to stem the red ink that
has swamped the airline for a decade. The main reason for the cuts
is the planned sale of Eastern's Latin American routes to rival
American Airlines, announced shortly before Christmas.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, a major British
chemicals company, said Wednesday it has completed the sale of its
U.S. over-the-counter drug business to Johnson and Johnson-Merck
Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co. for $395 million.
   As part of the sale, ICI has also acquired the U.S. rights to
Merck Sharp and Dohme Inc.'s anti-depressant drug Elavil.
   ICI said the acquisition of the anti-depressant prescription
drug is to lay the groundwork for introduction of its own
antidepressant and central nervous system drugs in the future, the
company noted.
   Elavil has sales of up to $30 million a year, ICI said.
   The completion of the sale of the over-the-counter operation in
the United States, which ICI had disclosed in October, is part of
the company's overall strategy to move out of the over-the-counter
business into higher margin prescription drugs, said Phillip
Morrish, an analyst with the London investment firm Smith New Court
PLC.
   Elavil's proven marketing network is of prime benefit to ICI, he
said.
   ``It's easier to introduce products when you already have a
developed market and a known name,'' Morrish said.
   ICI said it doesn't break out profit or sales for the U.S.
business being sold, which includes Mylanta antacids.

<HEAD>Judge Approves $6 Million Settlement in Shareholder Suit</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf pvs, The lawsuit ... to CORRECT to corporate

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Wednesday approved a $6
million settlement of a lawsuit filed by a CBS shareholder who
claimed the company that owns the CBS television network was
mismanaged from 1983 to 1986.
   The lawsuit was brought in 1986 by Roger Minkoff, a real estate
investor from St. Croix, Virgin Islands, who owns 12 CBS shares.
The settlement, in which the management of CBS Inc. admits no
wrongdoing, will be paid by a corporate insurance policy. It was
reached Nov. 28.
   Because the suit was not a class action, the settlement money
will not be distributed among CBS shareholders. Instead, $4.5
million will go to the CBS treasury for an indirect benefit to
shareholders.
   The remaining $1.5 million will be used to pay Minkoff's
attorney, Richard Greenfield of Haverford, Pa. Minkoff will receive
$15,000 from the attorney's portion of the settlement.
   The type of lawsuit brought by Minkoff is called a derivative
action, which allows a shareholder to bring a lawsuit for an
alleged breach of fiduciary duty by the corporation's management.
According to Barron's Law Dictionary, recovery in such lawsuits
generally benefits the corporation because the cases assert a
corporate rather than individual right.
   In approving the settlement, U.S. District Judge John M.
Cannella said he found it to be fair and reasonable.
   Frank Barron, an attorney for CBS, said that even though the
network believed Minkoff's claims were without merit, CBS supported
the settlement because it would free CBS of the litigation and
benefit the corporation through the $4.5 million payment.
   Among the allegations in the suit were that CBS wasted corporate
assets when it bought part of the Ziff-Davis Publishing Co. in 1985
for $362.5 million and that the company was hurt by efforts to fend
off a takeover attempt by Ted Turner in 1985.
   The suit named as defendants former CBS chairman Thomas Wyman,
chairman William Paley, president and chief executive officer
Laurence Tisch and members of the CBS board in 1986.

   The stock market drifted in a narrow range
today, stalling after Tuesday's rise to record highs.
   The market's sharp rise Tuesday in the first session of the new
year featured strength in many stocks that had fared poorly in the
waning stages of 1989.
   Analysts said that resulted from a lifting of the pressure of
yearend tax selling.
   But some investors seemed reluctant to chase after stocks today,
given persistent worries about the outlook for the economy and
corporate earnings.
   In the minds of many observers, stocks of many companies still
represent a risky bet that business activity and earnings growth
will begin to recover later this year from the slump that set in
several months ago.

   The dollar ended mixed Wednesday against major
foreign currencies after firming overseas amid reported efforts by
the Bank of Japan to drive it down.
   Gold prices slipped here and abroad.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $394 a troy ounce, down $5.60 from Tuesday.
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$394.35 an ounce, off $5.40.
   Earl I. Johnson, a trader at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said
technical factors were largely responsible for the dollar's
movements. But he said trading remained thin as a number of dealers
extended their long New Year's Day holiday.
   The market was beginning to focus on Friday's unemployment data
for December to get a better picture on the outlook for the U.S.
economy, Johnson said. He said some dealers felt the data would
show strength in the number of non-farm jobs, which could support
the dollar.
   ``(But) I don't think it's sustainable. The fundamental argument
is for a weaker U.S. economy and softer (interest) rates,'' he said.
   Also depressing the dollar Wednesday were reports that Japan's
central bank had intervened several times in Europe and Singapore
to support the faltering yen, dealers said.
   The yen has been under pressure recently because of Japan's
relatively low interest rates and as rumors of anotehr stock
scandal start to surface.
   In Tokyo, the New Year's holiday continued with markets closed
Wednesday. The dollar was quoted in London at 145.70 yen compared
to Tuesday's 144.09. In New York, the dollar stood at 145.25 yen,
down from 146.40 Tuesday.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling dropped
to $1.6080 in London from $1.6115 late Tuesday, and rose to $1.6115
from $1.6085 in New York.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.7208 West German marks, up from
1.7128; 1.5785 Swiss francs, down from 1.5815; 5.8765 French
francs, up from 5.8510; 1,289.00 Italian lire, up from 1,284.00;
and 1.15985 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16005.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Tuesday: 1.7203 West
German marks, up from 1.7090; 1.5722 Swiss francs, up from 1.5715;
5.8745 French francs, up from 5.8335; 1.9370 Dutch guilders, up
from 1.9130; 1,286.00 Italian lire, up from 1,269.00; and 1.1602
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1604.
   Gold closed in London at $395.60 an ounce, down from $400.75
late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $395.25 an ounce, compared with
$401 on Friday. The Zurich markets were closed Monday and Tuesday
for public holidays.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell $5.96 to close at a bid $396.29 an ounce.
   Silver prices also eased. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.151 a troy ounce, down from
$5.183 Tuesday. Silver fell in London to $5.16 an ounce from $5.25.

<HEAD>Gerber CEO to Head Campbell Soup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELANIE BURNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co. on Wednesday named David
W. Johnson, chief executive officer at Gerber Products Co., its new
chief executive as the food products company moved to squash
speculation it will be sold.
   Johnson is the first outsider selected to head the company in
its 120-year history. He replaces R.Gordon McGovern, who announced
his early retirement in November after serving as president and
chief executive since 1980.
   Analysts hailed Johnson's selection and predicted he would bring
stability to Campbell amid growing dissent among members of
Campbell's founding family, who control about 59 percent of the
company's 129.6 million outstanding common shares.
   ``Fundamentally, it looks like the news may have shifted toward
the company being independent with such a strong executive being
named,'' said Marvin B. Roffman, of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia. ``David Johnson has a very fine reputation on Wall
Street as an oustanding marketer and an outstanding executive.''
   Johnson, 57, was chosen because of his experience at beleaguered
companies, Campbell Chairman Robert J. Vlasic said. He said
Johnson's successful turnaround of Gerber ``has made him one of the
food industry's most highly respected executives.''
   ``His first priority is to analyze the situation and come up
with recommendations to the board on plans for the future,'' Vlasic
said in a brief telephone interview Wednesday. ``We hope that in
turn will produce results that will change the minds of anybody who
presently wants to sell their shares.''
   Last month, three descendants of John T. Dorrance Sr., who
invented condensed soup in 1897, announced their intention to sell
their 17 percent interest and push for a sale of the entire
food-products company.
   A source close to the group who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said the family members endorsed Johnson's selection. But
the source said it doesn't alter the group's intentions.
   ``Johnson still faces some very formidable obstacles in turning
Campbell's around,'' the source said. ``It's a very volatile
situation here. You have a deeply-divided family and board of
directors.''
   Janney Montgomery's Roffman agreed that the possibility of a
sale or takeover remained. He said those pushing for a sale would
consider a move if the price were right.
   Campbell shares have been driven higher in recent weeks by
increasing signs of dissent within the Dorrance family.
   On Wednesday, Campbell closed down 75 cents to $54.25 a share in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Three children of longtime Chairman John Dorrance Jr., who
received control of their father's 31.3 percent stake in the
company, said last month they intend to maintain their ownership in
Campbell and keep the company independent.
   On Tuesday, a second group of investors that also includes
members of the Dorrance family said it would maintain control of
its 2.5 percent stake and support efforts to keep Campbell
independent.
   Johnson said he would take an aggressive approach at Campbell to
streamline its bottom line. He accepted a five-year contract and
begins the new post on Jan. 15.
   ``I really enjoy getting involved in turmoil,'' Johnson said in
an interview from Michigan. ``I do thrive on chaos.''
   Johnson joined Fremont, Mich.-based Gerber as its chief
executive in 1987 and has been credited with successfully pacifying
Gerber family shareholders, who hold just over 10 percent of the
company's stock. He also successfully reshaped the company after
several years of declining earnings and takeover rumors.
   Alfred A. Piergallini was elected chairman, president and chief
executive of Gerber to succeed Johnson, Gerber said following a
special meeting of the board of directors Wednesday.
   Campbell sells about 5 billion cans of soup annually. Its fiscal
1989 earnings totaled $13 million, or 10 cents a share, down
sharply from a profit of $274.1 million, or $2.12 a share, the
previous year.
   The most recent results were reduced by $343 million as a result
of a restructuring in August that included the closing of
manufacturing plants in Camden, Maryland and Tennessee with a loss
of 2,800 jobs.

   Before their classroom walls were repaired last
year, Tokyo University engineering students wore cloth masks for
fear of health hazards from asbestos particles blowing out from
cracks.
   Their precaution reflected growing concern about the
freewheeling use of asbestos in Japan, the noncommunist world's
biggest user of the insulating and fireproofing material.
   Nonetheless, widespread publicity about the dangers of breathing
asbestos has done little to encourage government restrictions, in
contrast to the tight limitations imposed in the United States and
other industrailized democracies.
   ``It would be a catastrophe if a severe earthquake like the one
in San Francisco hit Tokyo and destroyed buildings like ours,''
said Hikosaburo Yoda, a mechanical engineering instructor at Tokyo
University.
   ``And think about how many buildings containing asbestos are
demolished for reconstruction every day. It's even more scary,'' he
said.
   About 120 buildings are destroyed every day in Tokyo alone, the
local government says, but contractors aren't even required to warn
neighbors that tell-tale asbestos could waft into their homes.
   Medical evidence shows inhaling asbestos can cause fatal lung
damage, including cancer and other respiratory ailments.
   Asbestos is not only a danger to workers regularly exposed to
it, such as carpenters, shipbuilders and dockworkers, Irving
Selikoff, a Mount Sinai professor of medicine in New York, told a
recent symposium in Tokyo.
   A small crack in a steam pipe's asbestos insulation could spread
fibers spewing widely, he said. Selikoff urged Japan to cut
asbestos consumption and tighten safety measures.
   The mineral fiber is used in 3,000 common items ranging from
walls and roof tiles to automobile brakes.
   Japan considers asbestos contamination an occupational problem,
and has compensated 65 victims _ including 43 lung cancer patients,
said Teruo Arakawa, a Labor Ministry spokesman. He had no figures
on how many had died.
   In workplaces handling the material, Japan allows 10 times as
much asbestos fiber in the air as the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency. The limit of 2 fibers per cubic centimeter for most kinds
of asbestos was made a guideline in 1976 and a law last year,
although there is no provision for penalties.
   Japan banned the spraying of asbestos insulation in 1975, but
government officials say materials containing asbestos are
indispensable for fireproofing.
   The Asbestos Institute, an industry group in Montreal, Canada,
estimates Japan was the biggest user of asbestos in 1988 among
noncommunist countries, consuming 325,000 tons. Brazil was next,
using 190,000 tons. The Soviet Union was the largest consumer,
using 2 million tons last year.
   Tokyo Governor Shunichi Suzuki, who once vowed to make Tokyo
asbestos-free, now says the material is safe ``as long as it's not
sprayed.'' Asbestos insulates a new city hall building.
   Japan has no plan to follow the U.S. move to ban all
asbestos-containing material from public schools by 1996.
   In 1987, however, the Education Ministry ordered 47,000 public
schools nationwide to inspect sprayed asbestos in classrooms and
gymnasiums, said Kiyoshi Sawamoto, an Education Ministry spokesman.
   Only 1,366, or 3 percent, of the inspected schools reported they
had sprayed asbestos, and 1,000 have removed it, he said.
   More than 50 percent of Japan's classrooms and gymnasiums were
built before 1975, when asbestos was widely sprayed, Sawamoto said.
   Because it is difficult to learn the locations and condition of
asbestos in buildings, even well-planned demolition is never safe
enough, said Sentaro Yamazaki, a representative of Nippon Asbestos
Abatement Industries Association.
   ``Once fibers are released in the environment, they cannot be
retracted,'' he said.
   Japan imports its asbestos, mainly from the Soviet Union, Canada
and South Africa, said Katsumi Yamanaka, an executive of Japan
Asbestos Products Industrial Association.
   Asbestos factories are required to conduct air sampling twice a
year and report the results, but regardless of the outcome, there
are no provisions for penalties or mandatory health checks, said
Jun Sakamoto, spokesman for the Environmental Agency.
   There is some evidence that Japanese builders are becoming
sensitive to the concern about asbestos are are voluntarily cutting
back on its use.
   For example, Ryoichi Kawakami, a carpenter in Kyoto, western
Japan, said he uses asbestos-free material in housing jobs although
it costs up to 30 percent more.
   ``My clients understand it,'' he said. ``Who wants a house made
of something hazardous to your health?''

   Industries with multibillion dollar stakes in
clean air legislation fear President Bush will accept any bill that
he can sign before the politically popular Earth Day celebration in
April, according to a memo describing private strategy meetings.
   Members of the Clean Air Working Group, which includes major
oil, gas, auto and chemical companies, were told that an expensive,
Senate clean air bill should be stalled _ and that Senate Majority
Leader George J. Mitchell should be blamed for rushing the
legislation to the floor _ the memo says.
   President Bush on Wednesday gave the administration's official
blessing to Earth Day 1990, with a proclamation supporting the
nationwide activities that will call attention to environmental
protection.
   At the White House ceremony, he called on Congress to quickly
approve clean air legislation, but he warned he will veto such a
bill if it isn't ``carefully balanced'' to protect the nation's
economic interest as well as the environment.
   The Environmental Protection Agency's chief spokesman, David
Cohen, said ``We are hoping that Earth Day might create a backdrop,
a political opportunity or incentive'' for passage of clean air
legislation. But he added, ``The idea the administration would be
willing to settle for anything is ludicrous.''
   The memo, obtained by The Associated Press, said under the
heading ``notes from the CAWG Nov. 27 (1989) meeting:''
   ``Administration's game plan is to push CEO's (chief operating
officers) to support the president and get bills passed by Congress
in time for signing by Earth Day April 22nd.
   ``Calls from White House and EPA to CEO's are to be expected.
CAWG is concerned since they believe WH wants any bill by ED.''
``WH'' is the White House and ``ED'' stands for Earth Day.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., are the key
strategists on the Senate bill, which has generally won
environmentalists' support for its provisions aimed at cleaning the
air of acid rain, toxic chemicals and urban smog.
   But the industry group says the bill is too costly and would
impose too strict pollution reduction requirements on business. It
is stricter than legislation proposed by Bush and a separate
measure that passed a House subcommittee.
   The House measure is still before the full Energy and Commerce
Committee, but the Senate version was quickly approved by the
Environment and Public Works Committee in November. Mitchell said
it would be the first legislation considered when senators return
Jan. 23 from their winter recess.
   The industry group memo also described a meeting last Dec. 4, in
which participants were said to have pointed out that dozens of
senators were asking congressional research agencies for an
``economic impact analysis'' of the legislation. ``This is a key
part of stalling early action'' on the bill, the memo said.
   It said industry representatives were urged to contact senators
``many times'' and tell them ``senators are upset at Mitchell for
speed of action ... and not deliberating on the issues.''
   William Fay, administrator of the Clean Air Working Group, said
in an interview, ``Except for the word `stall,' it's probably
fairly accurate notes. I want a clean air bill this year. If it
gets done this year what's the purpose of a stall?
   ``I didn't use that language,'' Fay said, adding that he
couldn't recall whether another participant did.
   Fay denied that the participants were told to attack Mitchell.
But he acknowledged they were asked at the meeting to make a point
that ``this is basically a railroaded bill,'' because it was rushed
through the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee with
little debate in November.
   Fay said more than 100 business representatives attend meetings
of the coalition, which is composed of 1,950 companies and trade
associations interested in clean air legislation.
   A Mitchell aide would not comment on the specifics of the memo.
The aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Maine
Democrat had made it known for months that the bill would be the
first item of business this year. ``There will be significant
debate. Senator Mitchell welcomes that debate,'' the aide said.
   Baucus said ``the time has come for action'' and denied the
Senate measure was railroaded to the floor. The bill, he said, ``is
the result of 65 days of hearings, hundreds of meetings with
congressional, administration and industry representatives, and
literally thousands of pages of testimony.''
   Fay said the Senate bill's requirements for reducing smog are
``punitive, costly and inflexible.'' He said, ``A number of
industries with revenues exceeding $100 billion a year may not
survive'' the standards for reducing health risks from toxic
chemical emissions.
   He contended the requirement to cut acid rain emissions ``puts
an incredible economic burden on the industrial Midwest and
Southeast.'' Auto exhaust standards ``cannot be achieved by any
known technology,'' he said, and predicted that plants making
family-sized cars would have to shut down.

<HEAD>Paramount Stock Rises, CBS Shares Fall Amid Takeover Rumors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover speculation sent Paramount
Communications Inc. stock sharply higher and CBS Inc. shares lower
Wednesday as unconfirmed rumors surfaced that CBS was about to bid
for the entertainment and publishing giant.
   Paramount stock rose $1.50 to $52.37{ a share in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading while CBS tumbled $2.75 to $184 a share.
   CBS spokeswoman Ann Morfogen denied her company was about to bid
for Paramount, saying, ``It's not true. It's a rumor.''
   At Paramount, spokesman Jerry Sherman said his firm would not
comment on any rumors.
   Spokespeople at both companies said they had gotten calls from
the news media about the rumors, which apparently were circulating
among CBS news employees.
   Paramount, parent of Paramount Pictures, has been considered a
possible takeover target ever since it launched its own ill-fated
$12.2 billion buyout bid for Time Inc. last year.
   CBS, meanwhile, has been expected to expand since Laurence A.
Tisch became chief executive in 1986 and began selling the
company's book and magazine publishing businesses and its records
divisions.
   Wall Street analysts said they would be surprised by a CBS bid
for Paramount, but they also said the combination had many
advantages for the broadcaster.
   Peter Appert, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence-Morgan Grenfell,
said regulatory strictures on the television networks are easing
this year and that one of the big networks likely would seek its
own production company to create more in-house programming.
   Paramount, which until last June was called Gulf &amp; Western Inc.
systematically pared itself down in recent years from a
conglomerate to a specialist in publishing and entertainment.
   Besides Paramount Pictures, company properties include the
publishers Simon &amp; Schuster and Prentice Hall, cable television
systems and networks including USA and MSG, Madison Square Garden
in New York and the New York Knicks and New York Rangers
professional sports teams.
   Paramount Pictures' current films include ``Harlem Nights,''
``We're No Angels,'' and ``Shirley Valentine.''
   CBS' businesses include its television and radio networks;
entertainment, sports and news divisions; and five television and
20 radio stations.

   The settlement price for the February contract was the highest
since the near-month contract closed at $24.65 on April 20,
according to market analysts.
   Unleaded gasoline futures, which staged an unusual winter rally
on Tuesday, moved up again. Gasoline prices typically are more apt
to strengthen during the peak summer driving season. The February
contract added 1.54 cents to Tuesday's surge of 3.94 cents and
finished at 67.23 cents a gallon. The March through May contracts
ended with gains of 1.66 cents, 1.76 cents and 1.65 cents.
   Heating oil for February delivery rose 0.81 cent to 78.20 cents
a gallon, bringing the increase over the past two sessions to 3.95
cents. Heating oil contracts for March delivery jumped 1.47 cents
while the April and May contracts each added 1.16 cents.
   Strong fundamental demand plus speculative buying combined to
prolong the rally in the energy futures pits, said Larry Lawrence,
manager of options and technical analysis at Elders Futures Inc.
   He said refiners rushed to buy crude because of the wide margin
between crude and refined petroleum products and on the assumption
that prices for refined products could continue to go higher.
   Rumors of possible cutbacks in OPEC production also may have
lent support to crude prices, Lawrence said. The reports of reduced
oil output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
were not confirmed.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Fall Below $400 Amid Holiday Lull in Far East Buying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices fell decisively below $400 an ounce
Wednesday in trading marked by an absence of buyers from Far
Eastern markets, which were closed for the holidays.
   On other commodity markets, sugar, energy and orange juice
futures all climbed sharply; livestock and meat futures were mixed;
and grains and soybeans advanced.
   Gold futures settled $5.60 to $5.80 lower on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in February down
$5.70 at $396.40 a troy ounce, the lowest close since Nov. 17.
   Silver futures ended 2.9 cents to 3.3 cents lower with March at
$5.22 a troy ounce.
   Several market analysts said the decline reflected a lack of
buying rather than a wave of selling. The analysts were unwilling
to declare an end to the bullish trend that drove up gold prices
from about $365 to nearly $420 an ounce from mid-October through
Thanksgiving.
   ``I see this as a normal process of digesting gains,'' said
Bernard Savaiko, senior commodity analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in
New York.
   ``The market went too far, too fast on the upside and is now
returning to more realistic levels relative to the current threat
of inflation.''
   The market's slide could end, some experts said, when Japan's
financial markets reopen Thursday after a five-day New Year's
holiday.
   ``Most of the heavy demand which had underpinned prices and
provided firm support had come from the major Far Eastern
markets,'' said George Milling-Stanley, first vice president of
bullion sales with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Sugar futures surged on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange on talk that Mexico had bought a large amount of sugar and
the United States is likely to increase sugar imports as a result
of frost damage to sugarcane in Mexico and Florida over the
Christmas weekend.
   Sugar futures settled .50 cent to 1.20 cents higher with March
at 14.22 cents a pound.
   Energy futures continued to soar on supply concerns ahead of the
American Petroleum Institute's weekly inventory report. The report,
released after the close, showed larger-than-expected declines in
U.S. stocks of unleaded gasoline and petroleum distillates,
including heating oil. Crude-oil stocks were down slightly and near
expectations.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 11 cents to 79 cents
higher with February at $23.68 a barrel; heating oil was .81 cent
to 1.47 cents higher with February at 78.20 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 1.50 cents to 1.76 cents higher with February
at 67.23 cents a gallon.
   Orange juice futures soared for the sixth straight day on the
New York Cotton Exchange amid supply fears linked to the
Christmastime freeze in the Florida citrus belt and the continuing
suspension of orange juice exports from Brazil, which halted
shipments last week while it assesses the damage in Florida.
   Orange juice futures finished 1.8 cents to 8 cents higher with
January at $1.7205 a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange ahead of the Agriculture Department's quarterly
hogs-and-pigs inventory, which showed the national pork herd and
the breeding intentions of hog producers to be sharply below
expectations.
   Market analyst predicted at least one day of limit gains in the
hog futures market in reaction to the report.
   Live cattle futures finished .05 cent to .57 cent lower with
February at 77.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent lower
to .05 cent higher with January at 84.47 cents a pound; live hogs
were .07 cent to .50 cent higher with February at 49 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .48 cent to 1.22 cents lower with February
at 49.47 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices settled higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade, led by a rally in the soybean market after steep
losses in the previous session.
   Wheat futures settled { cent to 1{ cents higher with March at
$4.10 a bushel; corn was } cent to 2 cents higher with March at
$2.38{ a bushel; oats were } cent to 1} cents higher with March at

<TEXT>
   President Bush, who repeatedly has vowed not
to propose higher taxes, is considering a levy on certain raw
materials to encourage industrial recycling, administration
officials said Wednesday.
   The per-ton fee, which would be imposed on materials such as
glass, paper and aluminum, is likely to be included in Bush's
fiscal 1991 budget when it is submitted to Congress on Jan. 29,
said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday
that Bush's new budget, for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1,
will contain no new taxes.
   ``We do not believe there's any need to raise taxes,'' Fitzwater
said. At the same time, he said the new budget would contain ``some
very interesting programs.''
   Administration sources said that the proposal on raw materials
would be more of a ``user fee'' than a tax, thus exempting it from
Bush's no-new-taxes pledge.
   Budget officials frequently seek to draw a distinction between a
widely applied tax and a more narrowly targeted ``user fee,'' even
though both raise revenues for the Treasury and even though the
distinction may be lost on those paying the levy.
   The aim of the raw-materials proposal, first reported by the
Wall Street Journal in Wednesday's editions, is intended to provide
an economic incentive for industries to use recycled goods rather
than virgin materials.
   The tax would not be applied to recycled substances.
   ``We want to encourage recycling, for obvious reasons,'' said
deputy White House press secretary Stephen Hart.
   While declining to discuss the proposal, he said ``work is under
way on the issue of recycling'' within the administration.
   Hart said that the work on recycling was part of Bush's
intention to put a focus on measures to protect the environment.
   Bush on Wednesday signed a proclamation designating April 22 as
Earth Day, the 20th anniversary of the first Earth Day.
   ``In deciding to make this Earth Day proclamation the first
proclamation of the new year and the new decade, I want to make
this point: Earth Day, and every day, should inspire us to save the
land we love, to realize that global problems do have local
solutions, and to make the preservation of the planet a personal
commitment,'' Bush said.
   The president also called on Congress to work ``quickly,
carefully and responsibly'' to approve strengthening amendments to
the Clean Air Act.
   Congress recessed for the year without completing work on a
legislative package to rework air quality standards.
   Fitzwater, meanwhile, said that the administration has abandoned
an earlier budget proposal that would have proposed a tax _ or user
fee _ on recreational vehicles to pay for conservation measures.
   ``We did a thorough assessment of that situation and weighed all
the ins and outs of the way that system worked and decided there
probably was a better way to do that,'' Fitzwater said.

<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard sent a top oil spill expert to
Morocco on Wednesday to help deal with the 19-million-gallon oil
spill from an Iranian tanker as the U.S. government said it was
considering other assistance.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Glenn Wiltshire, head of an oil spill
strike force in Mobile, Ala., left for Rabat, Morocco, where he
will work with the U.S. ambassador in coordinating U.S. response to
the spill, which has covered 100 square miles in the Atlantic
Ocean, said Cmdr. John McElwain, a Coast Guard spokesman.
   Wiltshire will look into equipment needs, response tactics and
possible clean-up operations, said McElwain.
   The spokesman said the strike force teams in Alabama and San
Francisco could be used in dealing with the spill, which resulted
from a Dec. 19 explosion that tore through the hull of the tanker
Khark 5, which has been towed to a spot 130 miles off the African
coast.
   McElwain said the Coast Guard teams have been used on oil spills
and other large-scale chemical releases around the world.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United
States told Morocco right after the spill that it would be
responsive to a request for help and has told the Rabat government
what resources might be available.
   He said the first request from Morocco for specific assistance
came Tuesday.
   ``We're also examining on an urgent basis other ways in which we
can provide help and advice, including the dispatch of other
experts,'' said Boucher.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Court Approves Sale of Four Miller &amp; Rhoads Stores to
May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miller &amp; Rhoads Inc. won court approval
Wednesday of a plan to sell four of its stores for $22.7 million to
The May Department Stores Co. of St. Louis.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Douglas O. Tice Jr., dismissing objections
raised by several parties, approved the sale.
   Miller &amp; Rhodes, a 14-store chain, is liquidating its assets
after 104 years in business. Two of the four stores being bought by
May are in the Richmond area and two are in Hampton Roads. The four
stores will become part of May's Arlington-based Hecht's chain, a
market leader in the Washington-Baltimore area.
   Chief among the objections was a complaint by unsecured
creditors that contended Miller &amp; Rhoads' principal owner,
Philadelphia developer Kevin F. Donohoe, was ``self-dealing'' at
the expense of creditors when he negotiated as part of the sale a
$1.3 million payment to the Chesterfield Towne Center, which he and
his partners own. One of the Miller &amp; Rhoads stores being sold to
May is located at the Chesterfield mall.
   Donohoe testified that to make a deal May would accept,
Chesterfield Towne Center had to agree to lease amendments that
will cost the mall at least $3 million. He said the mall's partners
accepted $1.3 million because May would not raise its offer.
   R. Dean Wolfe, May's executive vice president for real estate,
said his company was confident it could make the stores profitable.
With the addition of the four stores, the Hecht's chain will have
26 stores.
   Meantime, John E. Stokely, president of Miller &amp; Rhoads,
testified that the company has ``a handshake agreement'' to sell
two more stores _ in Roanoke and Lynchburg. He said M&amp;R expects to
finish negotiations to sell those stores by mid-January and close
the deal by the end of the month.
   The company has not found buyers for eight other stores,
including the flagship store and company headquarters in downtown
Richmond.
   Stokely said the company is looking for buyers for those stores.

<TEXT>
   Ingersoll Publications said Wednesday it
had sold four small newspapers and reached an agreement in
principle to sell a fifth.
   The sales, for amounts not disclosed, were part of the company's
long-range plans ``to concentrate on larger papers and metropolitan
markets'' in the United States and overseas.
   Ingersoll recently bought the New Haven Register for $255
million, invested in three newspapers in Dublin, Ireland, and
started the St. Louis Sun, a new tabloid newspaper.
   Ingersoll said American Publishing Co., of West Frankfurt, Ill.,
bought four community newspapers: The Tonawanda News, of North
Tonawanda, N.Y.; The Transcript of North Adams, Mass.; the
Sentinel-Standard of Ionia, Mich.; and the South Haven (Mich.)
Daily Tribune.
   American Publishing already owns 50 small newspapers, mainly in
the Midwest, with several in New York.
   Ingersoll said it had reached an agreement in principle to sell
The Courier-Tribune of Asheboro, N.C., to Donrey Media Group, of
Las Vegas, Nev. No price was announced on that sale, which
Ingersoll said was scheduled to close around Feb. 1.
   Donrey Media Group already owns 58 daily newspapers and 70
non-daily newspapers, including the Las Vegas Review-Journal,
according to Terry Johnson, a spokesman for the company. It also
has five cable television franchises and a license to operate a
television station.
   Ingersoll owns newspapers in New Jersey, New York, New England
and the Midwest.

<HEAD>Metals Producer Sells Last of Four Illinois Coal Mines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asarco Inc. said Wednesday it sold its last
operating coal mine, in Peoria, Ill., to a group of former
management employees for $3 million.
   The purchase by MidState Coal Co. completes a move by the New
York-based metals producer to sell all its coal operations because
of declining demand for high-sulfur content coal.
   Asarco had acquired four coal mines in Illinois in 1970 and shut
down three in recent years. The Rapatee mine, its final coal
operation, lost $2.2 million before taxes in 1988 and $2.3 million
in the first nine months of 1989, the company said.
   After announcing the planned closure of the Rapatee mine, Asarco
recorded a $10.2 million after-tax charge against its 1989
third-quarter earnings of $52.7 million, or $1.25 a share, on sales
of $522 million.
   Asarco produces copper, silver, lead, zinc, gold and other
metals. It also makes speciality chemicals, minerals and other
industrial products and provides environmental services.
   The company has operations in 10 states and in Australia,
Canada, Mexico and Peru. Asarco and its associated companies
account for more than 10 percent of free world mine production of
copper, silver, lead and zinc.

   Sailors fought to keep a huge oil slick
from fouling sensitive Atlantic coastline Wednesday as Dutch TV
reported that three sister ships of the tanker involved were
recently seized for maintenance defects.
   Seamen laid floating barriers while helicopters sprayed
chemicals on a greenish, 100-square-mile spill oozing from the
Iranian tanker Khark 5.
   Morocco threatened to file a lawsuit against Iran's national oil
company and accused salvors of reacting too slowly to the Dec. 19
explosion that tore through the Khark 5's hull, spilling 19 million
gallons of crude oil.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher announced in
Washington that a Coast Guard anti-pollution expert was leaving for
Morocco on Wednesday to help with the crisis.
   Dutch Television said authorities in the Netherlands seized five
Iranian-owned tankers over the past 14 months and prevented them
from leaving Rotterdam until they underwent repairs _ among them
three sister ships of the Khark 5.
   None of the ships were identified and no specific defects were
listed. The report said only that the vessels failed to meet
international safety and environmental standards.
   Rotterdam's Shipping Inspection office, responsible for any
seizures in the world's largest port, was closed and could not be
reached for comment.
   Mohamed Naciri, head of a team of Moroccan lawyers following the
crisis for the government, said of the threatened lawsuit, ``The
financial damages can only be estimated when we have the means to
measure the harm, which already seems very high to us.''
   Salvors towed the Khark 5 outside the 200-mile limit of
Morocco's territorial waters, the official Maghreb Arabe Presse
news agency reported. But the Dutch salvage firm Smit Tak said the
half-sunken vessel was 130 miles off North Africa.
   Helicopters sprayed oil-dispersants on the leading edge of the
slick, which crept to within 20 miles of the oyster-farming
community of Oualidyia, MAP said.
   In addition, two French techicians in Morocco helped direct
operations to vacuum polluted seawater into separators that recycle
the water and pump the oil into barges.
   Pollution experts have said high waves have broken up much of
the oil, which has also been dissolving in the 60-degree seas.
   Weather forecasters said winds and 13-foot waves on Thursday may
make conditions unfavorable for clean-up and salvage operations,
MAP reported.
   Fisheries, tourist beaches, a migratory bird reserve and an
important breeding ground of pink flamingoes would be threatened by
the oil, the Interior Ministry said. So would 100,000 related jobs.
   ``This fishing coast represents 75 percent of the 600,000 tons
of fish caught each year in Morocco,'' said Maritime Fishing
Minister Bensalem Smili.
   Back in Paris from a two-day visit to the former French colony
to assess the spill, French Envrionment Minister Brice Lalonde
criticized gaps in international maritime law to protect the
environment.
   ``I'm concerned not only with what's going to happen to the
Moroccan coast ... but with what's going to happen to the tanker
now that it's on the open seas,'' Lalonde said.
   Three tugboats towed the 283,632-ton ship toward calmer waters
near the Cape Verde islands, an 1,100-mile journey expected to take
eight days.
   There has been no leakage from the tanker's two ruptured storage
tanks since Monday, according to Smit Tak spokesman Daan Kaakebeen.
MAP said about 530 gallons of oil continued to escape each hour.
   The Khark 5 was loaded with 72 million gallons of light Iranian
crude oil when the explosion occurred about 400 miles north of Las
Palmas in the Canary Islands.
   The cause of the blast is unknown. A fire forced the crew to
abandon ship.
   Morocco says Smit Tak took too long in getting salvage work
under way. The company says its operations were hampered by the
refusal of Morocco and Spain to allow the tanker to be towed near
their coasts for emergency repairs.

   Pan Am Corp. said Wednesday it has asked the
Department of Transportation to block the sale of Trans World
Airlines' Chicago-London route to American Airlines and to award
the route to Pan Am instead.
   Last month, TWA agreed to sell its Chicago-London route, plus
facilities at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, to American
for $195 million. The transaction requires approval by the
Department of Transportation.
   TWA spokesman Don Morrison said that airline was studying Pan
Am's filing with the department and would have no immediate comment.
   Ed Stewart, a spokesman for American at its headquarters near
Fort Worth, Texas, said, ``We're confident that we're going to get
approval. ... It's a win-win situation.''
   He said American, the nation's largest airline, is ``the only
viable player'' since it has a hub in Chicago.
   In a statement, New York-based Pan Am said the ``fair and most
expeditious way for the government to proceed is to designate the
only other U.S. carrier certificated in the market, Pan Am.'' TWA
has been the only U.S. airline allowed to fly the Chicago-London
route, Pan Am noted.
   Pan Am, which has been in financial trouble for years, said it
would offer many benefits that American cannot provide, such as
being able to serve London's more popular Heathrow Airport while
American would only be able to fly into Gatwick Airport.
   Late last month, Pan Am said it intends to protest to the
government American's planned purchase of Eastern Airlines' Latin
American routes, which depart from Miami. Pan Am contends that the
route transfer from ailing Eastern to expanding American would
hinder competition. Pan Am, American and Eastern compete strongly
in the Miami market.
   In its statement Wednesday, Pan Am said American's proposed
purchase of the Chicago-London route ``is part of a recent pattern
of route and asset purchases by the largest U.S. carrier that will
result in further concentration in the aviation industry and less
competition.''

<TEXT>
   G. Heileman Brewing Co. is reporting
higher operating income for the first half of its fiscal year and
is working with its banks on possible ways to modify its debt
structure, a top Heileman official said Wednesday.
   Operating income for the first half of the brewery's fiscal year
far exceeds last year's results, said President Murray Cutbush in a
news release in which he tried to put some distance between
Heileman's financial condition and that of its parent, Bond Corp.
of Australia.
   At the same time, he said the brewery is ``working closely with
its banks in reviewing a number of additional alternatives aimed at
favorably modifying Heileman's existing debt structure.''
   Heileman's bankers in the United States have granted
modifications and waivers to the brewery's revolving credit
agreement, Cutbush said. Those changes allow Heileman the required
flexibility to achieve its operating goals and improve its overall
financial position, he said.
   ``Heileman's focus remains on core brand profitability,''
Cutbush said. ``This strategy is now paying dividends which are
reflected in our bottomline results. At a time when Heileman is
coming into its own, it's unfortunate that unrelated issues are
clouding the gains that we've achieved.''
   Cutbush said Heileman is a stand-alone operation, with financing
independent of Bond Corp., headed by Alan Bond.
   Bond lawyers are fighting an effort to have the company's
Australian brewing interests placed in receivership. The National
Australian Bank, which has loans to Bond Corp., requested the
action.
   Cutbush noted the moves involving the Australian brewing
operations do not have a direct affect on Heileman operations.
   He added that an interest payment due in the United States from
Bond _ a payment that reportedly has been delayed _ is not
associated with Heileman.
   La Crosse-based Heileman's financial arrangements contain no
``cross-fault'' clauses that could be triggered as a result of the
receivership action in Australia against Bond Brewing Holdings
Limited, a subsidiary of Bond Corp., Cutbush said.
   Cutbush said Heileman's ``strong financial performance'' so far
this fiscal year results in part from price increases implemented
last year, continuing emphasis on core brands, savings from lower
agricultural costs, reduced capacity and lower general and
administrative costs associated with the company's regional
operating structure.
   ``We're now seeing the results of those critical programs
implemented in 1989. They'll continue to produce the kind of fiscal
gains we've already seen in the first half of this fiscal year,''
Cutbush said.
   Bond purchased Heileman for about $1.3 billion in 1987, then
sold off the Heileman Baking and Machine Products Co. subsidiaries
to reduce debt.

   New home sales jumped 9.6 percent in November,
their fastest gain in four months, the government said Wednesday in
a report analysts saw as evidence that the housing industry
continues to be aided by lower mortgage rates.
   ``It shows that when mortgage rates are at relatively affordable
levels, buyers will be buying homes,'' said Mark Obrinsky, an
economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association.
   Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of
Home Builders, agreed that the report shows ``consumers are
responding to lower interest rates.''
   But Carliner added that many home builders are concerned wether
rates will remain at low levels this year, saying that ``in the
five years I've been here, I`ve never seen them so nervous.''
   The Commerce Department said new, single-family homes were sold
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 710,000 units in November
after a revised 0.9 percent gain the month before. October sales
originally were reported down 0.5 percent.
   It was the sharpest surge since a 14.1 percent advance last July.
   ``This certainly should take some of the wind out of stories
that the housing market is about to collapse,'' said economist
Richard Peach of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   Peach noted that in addition to new home sales, sales of
existing houses also hit a fairly good pace in November and that
housing starts, ``while not rising like gangbusters,'' are
improving.
   Some analysts, including Carliner and Obrinsky, saw the
possiblity of slightly higher mortgage interest rates this year as
the Federal Reserve straddles a fine line of trying to keep
inflation under control by restraining credit while not pushing the
economy into a recession with high interest rates.
   The Fed began last June to let short-term rates drop gradually.
Mortgage rates have fallen from an 11.22 percent peak to 9.74
percent at the end of November, according to the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp.
   Nevertheless, new home sales for the first 11 months of the year
were down 3.5 percent from the same period of last year.
   The sharpest gain in new home sales in November occurred in the
West, which posted a 29.9 percent advance. Analysts attributed much
of the increase to a rebound from depressed sales following the
Oct. 17 San Francisco Bay-area earthquake. October sales in the
region had plummeted 21.6 percent.
   The Midwest also recorded strong sales, up 23.6 percent. Sales
in the Northeast rose 8.5 percent.
   The South had the only decline, a drop of 7.6 percent.

<HEAD>Tokyo Meeting Postponed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The United States and Japan have postponed
until February the next round of talks on indirect causes of the
huge trade imbalance between the nations, such as different
lifestyles and cultural and business traditions.
   ``The Japanese government requested that we postpone for some
weeks our January meeting so that more time could be devoted to
preparing for the talks, and we agreed to the request,'' the State
Department said in a statement Wednesday.
   ``The next session will take place at a mutually convenient time
and place in February,'' the statement added, opening the
possibility it could be elsewhere than Tokyo, where the meeting
originally was planned for mid-January.
   Only modest progress, ``far less than we had hoped for,'' was
reported by a U.S. Treasury official after the second round of the
talks in Washington last November.
   The official, Assistant Secretary Charles Dallara, said the
Japanese side showed ``very little flexibility ... in reaching
common ground on the nature'' of structural problems that lead in
part to the $50 billion annual U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
   An official of Japan's foreign ministry cautioned after the
Washington round that progress ``could not be expected overnight.''
   The Bush administration has staked high hopes on success of what
is officially called the Structural Impediment Initiative, and
warned that its failure would revive pressure from Congress to
restrict U.S. imports of Japanese goods.
   The talks were proposed to pinpoint problems contributing to the
trade imbalance stemming from lifestyles, traditions and
traditional business practices rather than formal market barriers.
An interim report is due in early spring.

<HEAD>CenTrust Announces Proposed Merger With New York Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed merger of financially troubled CenTrust
Bank with a bank owned by a billionaire cruise ship magnate was
announced late Wednesday as part of a plan to ward off regulators
from the Miami-based savings and loan.
   The non-binding agreement calls for CenTrust and Ensign Bank to
begin negotiations to reorganize under a new holding company. The
merger would include a cash infusion from Ensign's parent, Hamilton
Holding Co., which is controlled by Carnival Cruise Lines Inc.
principal owner Ted Arison.
   The merger would be contingent upon several conditions,
including federal approval of CenTrust's plans to sell 63 of its 71
branches to Great Western Bank of Beverly Hills, Calif., according
to a statement by both companies.
   Ensign Financial Corp., which operates New York-based Ensign
Bank, has 27 branches in metropolitan New York and in Florida and
reported federally insured assets in 1988 of about $2 billion.
   Last year, Ensign called off a $170 million takeover bid for
Anchor Savings Bank of New York, a merger that would have created
the nation's fifth-largest savings bank with assets of about $10.3
billion.
   The latest proposed merger is intended halt pressure from
regulators seeking to reorganize CenTrust, which was criticized for
its heavy investment in an expensive art collection and the lavish
lifesytle of Chairman David Paul.
   In December, the federal Office of Thrift Supervision ordered
CenTrust to sell its art collection, some of which had been kept at
Paul's home, as well as limousines, a corporate jet and a sailboat.
   It also forbid CenTrust from increasing its executives' salaries
or paying dividends to stockholders.
   State Comptroller Gerald Lewis on Dec. 20 gave Paul 21 days to
resign or contest the complaint. A statement released by CenTrust
said Paul would ``vigorously oppose'' removal.
   Lewis' complaint claimed Paul violated his duty as officer of a
financial institution by using CenTrust employees to perform
personal services, charging the company for personal bills and
buying luxuries. It cited $30 million in art bought with CenTrust
funds, including $12 million paid for Peter Paul Rubens' ``Portrait
of a Man as Mars.''
   The complaint also questioned Paul's $4.8 million salary from
January 1988 to September 1989, when the thrift suffered pre-tax
operating losses of $76 million.
   Last week, a U.S. District Court judge in Washington refused an
appeal by CenTrust and ordered the bank to take back a $310,000
bonus paid to Paul in October.
   CenTrust, with $9 billion in assets, is Florida's largest thrift
and the 22nd largest in the country.
   The statement issued late Wednesday did not place a price on the
proposed merger or indicate how much would be paid to CenTrust
shareholders.
