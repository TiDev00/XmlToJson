   Accused drug traffickers who turn
themselves in to Colombian authorities will not be extradited to
the United States, President Cesar Gaviria said Wednesday in an
official decree.
   Gaviria said the policy, a notable departure from the past,
forms part of the government's plan to end drug-related terrorism
in Colombia.
   ``Those who have been in crime and who have repented, and who
voluntarily turn themselves in to judges in order to freely confess
their crimes may be tried by our judges based on our judicial
order,'' Gaviria said in a nationwide televised speech.
   During the past year, the Medellin cocaine cartel has been
demanding an end to extradition, the fate drug traffickers fear
most.
   The cartel in July declared a unilateral ceasefire in its
terrorist attacks, apparantly hoping that the new administration
would end extraditions. Gaviria was inaugurated Aug. 7.
   He said in his speech Wednesday that criminals who turn
themselves in will face lighter sentences.
   ``Judges will be given the capacity to reduce sentences ... of
those who turn themselves in, confess their crimes, lay down
weapons and other goods linked to their crimes and cooperate with
investigations,'' Gaviria said.
   In repeated communiques, drug traffickers using the pseudonym
``The Extraditables'' offered to turn themselves in to Colombian
judges, in an apparant attempt to convince the government to end
extraditions.
   The Extraditable's communiques bore the letterhead, ``We prefer
a tomb in Colombia to a jail cell in the United States.''
   Gaviria's predecessor, Virgilio Barco, reinitiated extraditions
a year ago after drug traffickers declared war on the state.
   Twenty-two Colombians accused of drug trafficking have been
extradited to the United States since then.
   Violence meanwhile has soared, with policemen in particular
singled out as targets of hitmen hired by drug traffickers. A
domestic airliner in addition was blown out of the sky this year
outside Bogota, killing more than 100 people.
   The government has blamem the Medellin cartel for killing more
than 500 people, including three presidential candidates.
   Thousands of others have died in fighting between rival drug
gangs and violence by right-wing death squads financed by cocaine
smugglers.
   In his speech Wednesday, Gaviria said three Colombians currently
awaiting extradition will be sent to the United States.
   He said three other extradition requests by the United States
have been rejected.
   There are 14 people held in Colombian jails awaiting extradition.

   Jennifer Folsom, who went public with her
family's struggle against AIDS, died at her home Wednesday.
   Her husband, Doug, shot himself in June when, overcome by the
strain of having his wife and young daughter infected with the
deadly virus.
   A second daughter so far hasn't tested positive for the virus.
   ``This afternoon she smiled, and that was the end of it,'' said
Jim Leith, a family friend in Duxbury, where Folsom lived.
   ``She was a super lady,'' he said. ``She was a gutsy thing. You
could take a good example from her. She knew exactly how to handle
herself.''
   In an interview with the Associated Press in July, Folsom, 29,
said she wanted people to know she had AIDS because she wanted to
``live with dignity and not have people whispering behind my back.
I'm not ashamed of who I am. (AIDS) invaded my home without
permission.''
   A blood transfusion during an emergency appendectomy in a
Massachusetts hospital in 1979 _ before blood supplies were tested
and purged of the virus _ probably carried the AIDS virus into her
body.
   She was diagnosed in February 1988. The doctor gave her the test
results in his empty office after closing; he was concerned, she
said, about how his staff would react to an AIDS patient.
   Angela, Folsom's 3-year-old daughter, also has withered from
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and requires round-the-clock
nursing.
   ``It's not over,'' Leith said. ``They have to take a deep breath
and come out of this, and deal with that too.''
   Angela and 4-year-old Nicolette, who is tested for the virus
every six months, will live with grandparents, Leith said.
   Folsom initially told friends and neighbors that she had cancer.
But then went public with her story because she wanted people to
know that rural Vermont hasn't escaped AIDS.
   ``Here I am, this white, middle-class housewife living in
Vermont, trying to make a living,'' she said. ``How dare this
disease come into my home? It's AIDS. I eat and drink and sleep
AIDS. But I'm not afraid of it anymore.''

   The Soviet Union will maintain diplomatic ties
with Iraq for now but still demands that Iraq end its occupation of
Kuwait, Tass reported Wednesday following President Mikhail
Gorbachev's meeting with the Iraqi foreign minister.
   U.S. Sen. Bob Dole said he believed the minister, Tareq Aziz,
was carrying a message for Gorbachev to give to President Bush at
the superpower summit in Helsinki.
   The Kansas Republican, the minority leader in the Senate, spoke
to reporters after his own meeting with the Soviet president in the
Kremlin. Aziz met with Gorbachev later in the day.
   Tass said the meeting was held at the request of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein and that the two held a frank discussion on the gulf
crisis.
   It said Soviet officials emphasised that they want, ``for the
moment at least, to maintain permanent diplomatic contact with
Iraqi leaders.''
   ``Until now, however, no political or diplomatic contacts
between Moscow and Baghdad have produced the desired result _ the
immediate withdrawal of all Iraqi troops from Kuwait and the
restoration of that country's independence and sovereignty,'' Tass
said.
   Dole said he thought Aziz was ``coming here, hopefully, to pass
some message on to Gorbachev that might be passed on to President
Bush.''
   ``Maybe it will provide some breakthrough, maybe some little ray
of hope. Maybe Saddam Hussein now realizes he made a big, big
mistake'' by invading Kuwait on Aug. 2, Dole told an airport news
conference minutes before leaving for Washington.
   Bush and Gorbachev meet in the Finnish capital Sunday. The
crisis following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was expected to rank
high on their agenda.
   Aziz was to address a news conference Thursday at the Soviet
Foreign Ministry, and was expected to discuss the message he was
believed to have carried.
   Dole said he and six other Republican senators winding up a trip
to the Soviet Union ``just had a very good visit with President
Gorbachev. ... We talked about a number of issues, particularly the
upcoming summit.
   ``We indicated ... none of us want armed conflict. We hope there
will be a peaceable solution. ... My impression is that Gorbachev
is in almost total agreement on this point.''
   ``He indicated it was a turning point that was very important
for both countries,'' Dole said. ``He sees it as a very important
meeting, when you think about this being the two superpowers
meeting now for the first time with reference to a conflict where
they are both on the same side.''
   Gorbachev told the senators his meeting with Aziz was
``initiated at the request of the Iraqis,'' Dole reported. ``He
said in effect, `I am prepared to hear them out and of course I
will be reporting to President Bush on what was said and what
transpired.'''
   In an interview broadcast on Soviet television Wednesday night,
Gorbachev described Dole as ``close to President Bush'' and said
``the conversation was important for me in connection with the
forthcoming meeting in Helsinki.''
   During the interview, Gorbachev dwelt almost exclusively with an
economic program he is expected to announce next week to move the
Soviet Union closer to a market economy, away from the current
central planning system.
   Dole replied when pressed on what proposals Gorbachev and Bush
might make to end the gulf crisis, ``I wouldn't even speculate'' on
what would transpire.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said he asked Gorbachev ``to clarify
this question of the Soviets there in the capacity of advisers and
experts,'' referring to 193 Soviet employees affiliated with Iraq's
military.
   According to Warner, Gorbachev ``said right away, `They're not
advisers. They have not been involved in the hostilities. They are
simply contractors there to work on the equipment. We would like to
bring them back. But if we were to break those contracts and bring
them back home, it could well jeopardize the 6,000-8,000 Soviets
there''' on construction contracts.
   Warner, ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said Gorbachev also wanted to sign treaties with the
United States and other Western nations to cut conventional and
long-range nuclear arms by the end of the year.

<HEAD>Eastern European Anti-Semitism Discussed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish and Roman Catholic leaders from 16
countries have agreed that a major inititiative is needed to combat
anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe, the New York Times reported in
Thursday editions.
   The agreement came in Prague, Czechoslovakia, at the first
formal meeting in five years of the Vatican Commission on Religious
Relations with the Jews and the International Jewish Committee on
Interreligious Consultations. The four-day meeting was scheduled to
end Thursday.
   Archbishop William H. Keeler of Baltimore told the Times the
conference's closing statement would call for Catholic repentance
and stress that anti-Semitism ``is a sin against God and humanity.''
   It also will recognize ``the special problems of anti-Semitism
in Eastern and Central Europe,'' said Rabbi Jack Bemporad, chairman
of the Interreligious Affairs Office of the Synagogue Council of
America.
   Open anti-Semitism is said to be on the rise in the region, as
the fall of totalitarian Communist regimes allows people to express
their views more freely.
   Participants at the meeting recommended that other Eastern
European countries follow the lead of Poland and Czechoslovakia in
setting up Catholic-Jewish liaison committees.
   It also urged rapid translation and dissemination of recent
Vatican statements on Catholic-Jewish relations. Eastern European
churches lacked either permission or resources to publish these
documents.
   Also recommended by participants are systematic efforts rid
textbooks of religiously or racially divisive material,
establishment of seminary courses and training programs for priests
to counter anti-Semitism, and new efforts to defend religious
liberty and monitor any outbreaks of anti-Semitism.
   Vatican officials also reaffirmed their intention to prepare a
major document on the church and the Holocaust, a project pledged
in 1987 but delayed.
   Catholic-Jewish relations are ``back on track,'' Seymour Reich,
chairman of the Jewish committee, told The Times.
   The Jewish committee was established in 1967 as an umbrella
group for discussions with the Vatican. Its membership includes the
Synagogue Council of America, B'nai Brith International and the
World Jewish Congress.

scheduled for 1:20 a.m. Thursday, but Cable News Network plans live
coverage.
   CNN will broadcast the liftoff live and will update its coverage
throughout the day, a spokeswoman said.
   An NBC spokeswoman said the network would not itself broadcast
the space shuttle launch live, but would offer a live feed to its

<TEXT>
   Four months ago, someone painted a small,
rusty-red swastika on a stone pillar a few steps from the Israeli
ambassador's home.
   He drives by it every day, neighbors walk dogs past it, children
play nearby. No one has tried to obliterate the ugly symbol.
   Graffiti and other signs of anti-Semitism are being seen again
in Poland, even though it is nearly bereft of Jews, and the
prejudice of the streets has begun to infiltrate politics.
   Some rightist politicians are fanning nationalist emotions and,
with a seeming inevitability, anti-Semitism.
   On the other side, prominent anti-Communist figures like Adam
Michnik, editor of the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, and Zbigniew
Bujak _ both leaders of the pro-government Democratic Action party
_ have been sounding the alarm.
   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa, indignant at suggestions of
bigotry on the part of himself or some of his followers, declared:
``Lech Walesa is not and will not be anti-Semitic.''
   In a resolution July 29, Walesa's national Citizens Committee
condemned both prejudice and the use of unfounded charges of
anti-Semitism to smear political opponents. Members of the
committee have accused foreign journalists of exaggerating the
extent of anti-Semitism in Poland.
   The late sociologist Aleksander Hertz, a Polish Jew, said
anti-Semitism grew in the 19th century in response to Poland's
humiliating partitions, Russian influences and the prosperity of a
burgeoning Jewish population, which both the declining aristocracy
and impoverished peasants resented.
   In politics, anti-Semitism peaked just before World War II, when
it was a major tenet of the popular National Democrats. University
students hounded Jewish colleagues and anti-Semites organized
boycotts of Jewish businesses.
   Three million Polish Jews were killed by the Nazis. Some of the
half-million who survived owed their lives to Poles who hid them,
but others were betrayed by Polish acquaintances.
   Polish Jews who lived through the Holocaust were traumatized by
it and feared trying to reclaim homes and property from Christians,
particularly after a pogrom in 1946 that took 48 lives in Kielce.
Most of them emigrated to Israel or the United States.
   An official Communist purge of ``Zionists'' prompted the last
big wave of emigration in 1968, reducing the number of Jews to
5,000-15,000 in a nation of 38 million people.
   For the first time in centuries, Poland is without a large
Jewish population, and profound changes have resulted.
   Before the war, Jews were about 10 percent of the population,
concentrated in towns and cities, and made up a large part of the
middle class. The landed aristocracy disdained commerce and
peasants stuck to their farms, so much of the small business, trade
and industry were left to Jews.
   Half a century after Nazi occupation, Poland still has not come
to grips with the loss of its Jewish population. Any discussion of
Jews is likely to provoke strong emotions, often defensive.
   Poland's only rabbi, Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz, said he had
noticed more anti-Semitism recently. He used to find respect and
friendliness when he walked the streets in his traditional orthodox
garb, Joskowicz said, but now encounters hostility.
   ``Two weeks ago, I had guests from Israel and we went for a
walk,'' he said in an interview. ``Then youths, maybe 21, maybe
younger, started shouting `Jews to Palestine' and other slogans,
too. I did not pay any attention, let them shout.
   ``But when we walked a few meters they approached us and started
hitting one of the guests.''
   Joskowicz said he now avoids walking at night and does not know
what to tell Jews from abroad when they ask him if it is safe to
visit Poland.
   There is a tendency to blame Jews for the nation's troubles.
   ``I keep hearing that a gang has gotten to the feeding trough,
they are probably Jews and they are destroying us,'' Walesa told a
meeting of his national Citizens Committee on June 24.
   He said such remarks do not mean anti-Semitism is increasing,
but that the government must do a better job of explaining itself
to the people.
   Farmers who occupied the Agriculture Ministry in June, demanding
guaranteed prices, were heard muttering about the ``Jewish
government.''
   That government is led by a devout Roman Catholic, Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who identifies with
Christian-Democratic politics and sometimes is accused of being too
solicitous of the church.
   Allegations that Jews run the government rest on the fact that
some prominent Solidarity politicians are Jews. Two examples are
Michnik and Parliament member Bronislaw Geremek, leader of the
Citizens Parliamentary Club, who are of Jewish descent but do not
practice the religion.
   Communist functionaries used such information in the past in the
vain hope of discrediting Solidarity.
   In August, the National Party, a far-right group based in the
southern city of Krakow, said it was unfair for an ethnic minority
to have dominance in the government. The Grunwald Society, created
by nationalistic Communists, contended recently that ``German and
Jewish chauvinists'' were the greatest threats to Polish
sovereignty.
   Government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska, who wrote a
book on the remaining Jews in Poland with her husband, a
photographer, said anti-Semitism is coming to the surface in the
more liberal atmosphere since Communist rule.
   ``Now everything is free,'' she said. ``Many good things have
come out, but also some bad things.''
   Some anti-Semitism is present in all countries, she said, and
``I hope it will be marginal in Poland too for the future. Because
it's visible, it can be fought.''

<DATELINE>EAGLE FORWARD BASE CAMP, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The harsh
conditions of the Saudi desert are taking a toll on U.S. military
equipment, affecting simple mechanical gear as well as sensitive
high-tech equipment, from M-16 rifles to weapons guidance systems.
   The warships patrolling the waters around the Arabian peninsula
are also have problems, officers and maintenance crews said.
   ``When you buy a stereo, what do the instructions say?'' Marine
Gunnery Sgt. Tate Ingles of Miami asked during a recent interview.
``They say you should keep it away from heat, dust and vibration.
You put the same electrical gear in the Saudi desert, and, well,
there you have it.''
   Because of the heat and sand, weapons systems that rely on
sensitive electronics and computers could be troublesome to operate
if extended hostilities broke out, technicians say.
   At Eagle Forward, a base camp for Apache gunships and other
helicopters of the 101st Airborne Division's air assault brigade,
the soft Saudi sand blown by the desert wind is the big headache.
   ``It's unbelievable. It gets everywhere,'' a maintenance crew
member said.
   Crews are flushing out the Apache engines with water every day
to rid them of the sand. The powdery sand also finds its way into
transmissions and gears that turn the rotors, forcing more frequent
maintenance on those systems as well.
   ``Hovering around in the desert is going to be very hard on the
engines,' said Maj. Greg Maisel, of Laredo, Texas, the executive
officer of a Marine attack squadron.
   Helicopters are being fitted with radiator filters much like the
black wraps often seen on fronts of sports cars.
   ``We were having a lot of overheating problems because of sand
clogging the radiators,'' squadron leader Lt. Col. Don Cody said.
``We think the filters have fixed that.''
   The sand scours the paint from rotor blades, exposing metal that
glints in the sun, making the helicopters easier to spot.
   Sand is the reason the Air Force is cutting the time between its
routine maintenance. Tests and routine adjustments made every 100
hours are now being done every 60-75 hours, an air force official
said.
   One persistent problem is sand clogging air-intake valves of jet
engines. Much like the Apaches, the engines of Air Force and Navy
planes, on the ground and aboard carriers, are being flushed with
water daily.
   A Marine sergeant cleaning his automatic rifle noted:
``Sometimes I'm not sure it would fire if I needed it to. We train
in the desert, but I've never seen anything like this.''
   Tanks need more frequent filter cleanings and track flushing and
higher viscosity oil. Radiators need to be checked constantly to
prevent overheating.
   The sand cakes on headlights and windshields and can get into
the fuel supply if proper care is not taken.
   Weapons systems protected from the sand can't escape the
scorching sun.
   Within days of arriving here, 82nd Airborne units were reporting
dead radios because wires were burned out or fused by the heat.
   One officer in the division said Monday that parts for the
radios and other equipment being damaged are getting hard to come
by. ``We're short quite a few things,'' said the officer, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``I'm sure we'll get them eventually.''
   Meantime, ingenuity is helping.
   On Tuesday, two 82nd soldiers were at a Safeway supermarket in a
Saudi town, cleaning it out of sponges and cloth. A vehicle
containing several TOW anti-tank missiles and other weapons
exploded at an 82nd motor pool Monday and the men suspect heat was
a factor.
   The equipment problems are frustrating, but the maintenance
crews try to keep a sense of humor.
   ``Some officer says, `Hey, my radio don't work,''' Ingles said.
   ``I tell him: `Sir, if you'd been sitting out here under a
magnifying glass in 130-degree temperatures all day, you wouldn't
work either.'''

<HEAD>Monet Stars at Royal Academy, Which Rejected Him in 1871</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Royal Academy of Arts in Piccadilly opens an
exhibition of 94 works by Monet on Friday, hoping to draw at least
a half million visitors over three months _ more than for any other
show in its 222-year history.
   Receipts at that level would bring in up to $5.6 million, which
could be used for its current huge renovation.
   The works in the new exhibition, ``Monet in the '90s: The Series
Paintings,'' are among the most beautiful and intriguing that Monet
did in his long life. He was 86 when he died in 1926 at his home in
Giverny near Paris.
   In the 1890s, he created series of paintings of the same
subjects in different weather and light, exhibiting each group as
it was completed.
   Among the subjects in the show are 11 views of grainstacks, 20
of poplar trees, 10 of Rouen cathedral, seven of misty mornings on
the Seine river, 15 of the Normandy coast, four of the Thames and
five of the Japanese-style bridge over Monet's waterlily pond.
   Ten paintings of the Creuse valley in central France include one
loaned by Britain's Queen Mother Elizabeth.
   Paul Hayes Tucker, associate professor of art at the University
of Massachusetts, spent four years assembling the exhibition from
five continents and said Monet's paintings of the 1890s were
``perhaps the grandest incarnation of his art.''
   ``They have been collected from all over the world with immense
difficulties and I believe we won't be able to see them together
again in our lifetime,'' said academy president Roger de Grey.
   The show, with some changes, opened at Boston Museum of Fine
Arts in February and was later seen at the Art Institute of
Chicago. London is its only venue in Europe.
   In 1872, Monet's style was dubbed ``impressionism'' by a
derisive critic who saw in Paris his painting of Le Havre called
``Impression: Sunrise.''
   Monet subsequently became rich and famous as the father of
impressionism, the most popular art movement the world has ever
known.
   Ironically, the academy in 1871 turned down three Monet
paintings of London: canvases of Hyde Park, Green Park and the
Thames river at Westminster.
   The academy is the first gallery in Britain to adopt the
European and American system of selling tickets in advance and has
already sold 16,000 at 5 pounds ($9.35) each.
   The show is open daily through Dec. 9.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A supermarket chain has slashed retail
beef prices by as much as 50 percent, and says it's partly because
the Persian Gulf crisis has cut off the Iraqi market for Irish meat.
   Superquinn, which has 12 outlets in the greater Dublin area, has
reduced the price of boneless rib steak from $3.20 to $1.70 per
pound.
   ``The whole thing is a cynical advertising ploy to grab a bit of
the market,'' William Smith, president of the Irish Master Butchers
Association, complained on Tuesday. He contended that wholesale
prices had held steady.
   ``There is an element of a special offer in it,'' said Fergal
Quinn, owner of Superquinn, but he insisted it was a legitimate
reaction to the gulf crisis.
   ``It's influenced by the fact that there is surplus of beef in
the market place,' he said.
   Iraq had been a major buyer of Irish beef, but the market was
cut off by a U.N.-ordered trade embargo following Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Quinn added that the drop in demand was largely for hindquarter
cuts, and he had no plans to mark down the price of sirloin.

   At the same time, Bush will try to help Gorbachev where he needs
it the most _ his ailing economy.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher will take some 15 chiefs of
American corporations to Moscow to begin discussions on large-scale
technical cooperation.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, meanwhile, will discuss
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze U.S. offers to
help improve areas such as banking, housing, the tax system and
distribution networks.
   Baker delivered a list of nine projects to Shevardnadze in Paris
in mid-July. This followed an initial discussion between Bush and
Gorbachev at the Malta summit last December, and Bush intends to
pursue the subject at Helsinki, provided the Persian Gulf crisis
does not take up all their time.
   A leader of the Communist Party's traditionalist wing told 2,500
delegates at a Russian party congress Tuesday that Gorbachev's
reform program is ``on the brink of collapse.''
   Ivan K. Polozkov, first secretary of the Communist Party in the
Russian Republic, drew vigorous applause from the delegates. The
group includes many generals and career party officials who are
believed to harbor reservations about Gorbachev's policies _ on
both the economic and Persian Gulf fronts.
   Many of those same conservatives do not seem to agree with the
Soviet leader and Shevardnadze, his chief interlocutor with the
U.S. administration, that the Cold War is over.
   Gen. Vladimir Lobov, the military chief of the Warsaw Pact, was
quoted last week as expressing grave doubts about the U.S. military
buildup in the gulf area. According to Tass, the Soviet news
agency, he warned that it ``drastically changes the strategic
balance in the region.''
   Fighting to keep his reforms going, Gorbachev cannot risk it all
by going much further than he has to accommodate Bush in his
campaign against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   After some initial hesitation, the Soviets voted Aug. 6 in the
U.N. Security Council for a worldwide economic boycott of Iraq and
then, on Aug. 25, after more hesitation, to use force to implement
it.
   In both instances, the Soviets could have killed the U.S. moves
with their veto. Gorbachev chose instead to support Bush in what is
the most dramatic gesture of superpower cooperation since the
waning of the Cold War.
   ``I don't know where we would be with this effort if it were not
for the cooperation and enlightened new thinking of the Soviet
leadership,'' Baker told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on
Tuesday.
   And yet, to keep peace with their political foes, Gorbachev and
Shevardnadze also are stressing the explosive nature of the
situation in the gulf and urging a speedy political settlement. It
is a view endorsed last weekend in Beijing by Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen after three hours of talks with Shevardnadze.
   If Bush could have his way, the Soviets would yank the 193
military advisers and some 1,000 other Soviet nationals involved in
training, maintenance and other military-related tasks in Iraq.
They are remnants of the Kremlin's long-term close military ties to
the Saddam government.
   ``We think, quite frankly, it is inappropriate to be providing
any military assistance to Iraq at the present time and we will
continue to talk to the Soviets about the 193,'' Baker told the
House committee.
   But he said it was not clear the Soviet advisers are free to
leave. Some 8,000 Soviet nationals are in Iraq and Kuwait.
   So, as Bush's Helsinki summit with Gorbachev shapes up, the
president will emphasize the cooperation he is getting from the
Kremlin and not haggle over the bumps in the road.
   ``We want to keep them on the reservation,'' a senior U.S.
official told The Associated Press on Tuesday. ``We are not asking
for anything specific at the moment.''
   A key U.S. objective, he said, is to assure the Soviets that the
military operation in the Persian Gulf is not directed against
Moscow.
   In all, 26 countries have sent in military forces, many of them
token contributions.
   While the West and Japan rely far more than the Soviet Union on
gulf petroleum, the Soviets are a superpower with close ties to a
number of Arab countries and clearly do not want the area dominated
by the United States.
   Bush is bound to make the point to Gorbachev repeatedly that the
U.S. objective is to force Iraq to reverse its annexation of Kuwait
_ and no more than that.

   The United States is working to develop a
long-term alliance to stabilize the Middle East in much the way
that NATO was used to contain Soviet expansion after World War II,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III says.
   At a hearing Tuesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
Baker described the alliance as ``a new security structure'' for
the region. He told a reporter later that it could be military in
nature, or diplomatic and political.
   The U.S. role remains to be defined, but the new entity would
include ``major Arab participation,'' said Baker, who also was
testifying today before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   ``We've still got a lot of work to do,'' Baker said after a
three-hour hearing in which he addressed for the first time
publicly how the United States ultimately might deal with the
continuing threat posed by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whose
forces invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Addressing the expense of the U.S. military operation in the
Persian Gulf, Baker said ``leadership sometimes does cost. It's
going to run us probably around $6 billion for the balance of
1990.''
   At the same time, some lawmakers reacted coolly to Tuesday's
announcement by the White House that President Bush wants to
forgive $7 billion in past military loans to Egypt, a reward for
President Hosni Mubarak's leadership in marshaling Arab opinion
against Saddam.
   Such a move would require action by Congress. Lawmakers said
they valued Egypt's action, but they were wary of the high figure,
which is equal to half of next year's total foreign aid budget.
   ``It's a small price to pay for the level of cooperation we've
gotten from Egypt,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater,
but the price looked a lot larger on Capitol Hill.
   ``It may be a little premature,'' said House Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill., just back from a four-day trip to the Middle
East during which he and other lawmakers met with Mubarak. ``I
would like to hear firsthand from the administration the
rationale,'' Michel added.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., whose Senate Appropriations foreign
aid subcommittee must deal with the request, predicted that other
nations _ Israel, Pakistan, Greece and Turkey, for example _ will
be lining up for similar favors.
   ``I know it's going to be necessary to increase some foreign aid
dollars as a result of Operation Desert Shield,'' the military and
economic drive against Iraq, Leahy said in an interview. But he
added, ``It looks like some in the administration are saying let's
have a blank check for foreign aid. I want to remind them that my
subcommittee's still got the checkbook.''
   Baker, in his testimony to the House committee, said creation of
a new multilateral security structure is ``likely to be required,
even if there is a pullback from Kuwait.''
   The new structure would involve ``some continuing U.S.
presence,'' he said. ``Maybe it wouldn't be a ground force
presence, maybe it would be a naval presence.''
   When asked by Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., whether any
multinational arrangement could prevent Saddam from developing
nuclear weapons, or from using the chemical and biological arsenal
he already has, Baker's answer sounded much like Cold War
deterrence.
   ``It is conceivably possible ... to come up with a security
structure that would make it so clearly to the detriment of any
subsequent leader, or even the present leader, to use or
contemplate using any of those weapons that there would be very
little risk that they would be used,'' Baker said.
   In other comments, Baker said:
   _Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat ``jumped
too quick'' in aligning himself with Iraq in the crisis. As money
flowing back home to Palestinian families from workers inside Iraq
falls off, ``I think there could well be ... some reassessment'' of
that commitment, he said. ``You are beginning to see in public
comments and in other ways that a reassessment is going on.''
   _The United States has added Iraq to its official list of
countries sponsoring terrorism. The move, which carries certain
automatic trade sanctions, was largely symbolic because Iraq
already is under a total economic embargo.

   An appeals court panel Tuesday postponed the
execution of a convicted murderer after hearing arguments that he
was coerced into confessing by a sheriff who now is a congressman.
   U.S. Rep. Tommy Robinson, has denied allegations he and his
Pulaski County deputies beat defendant Barry Lee Fairchild and five
other black suspects and urged them to confess to the killing of an
Air Force nurse.
   Fairchild, 36, was scheduled to die by lethal injection at 9
p.m. Wednesday for the 1983 abduction, rape and murder of Marjorie
``Greta'' Mason.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, on a 3-0 vote, ordered
the case returned to U.S. District Court for a hearing on the
allegations.
   The state attorney general's office was preparing to petition
the U.S. Supreme Court to dissolve the stay and let the execution
proceed.
   Assistant Attorney General Jack Gillean said he would argue in a
petition to be filed Wednesday morning that that defense attorneys
failed to present a plausible case that Fairchild is innocent. He
said that is a requirement this late in the appeals process.
   Fairchild's attorneys say he is mildly retarded, with an IQ
between the 60s and 80s, and contend he was easy prey for
authorities seeking to force a confession. He confessed twice, but
later said the statements were coerced.
   His lawyers also contend that someone other than Fairchild
confessed to the murder. They said police later dropped the man as
a suspect because he provided few details about the crime.
   ``We are not just dealing with coerced confessions. We are
dealing with what appears to be investigative practices that do not
depend on collecting evidence,'' Richard Burr of the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund told the panel. ``We are dealing with a systematic
practice of culling out suspects based on who's the weakest.''
   Before the stay was issued, Robinson, the congressman, issued a
news release saying: ``The attorneys for Barry Lee Fairchild have
lost all credibility. The affidavits filed today are the desperate,
last-minute moves of ambulance-chasing, publicity-seeking lawyers
who care more about ego gratification and about their own press
clippings than they care about our system of justice.''
   Robinson was elected as a Democrat but switched to the
Republican party. He lost the GOP primary for governor this year
and isn't seeking re-election to the House.
   In recent days, Burr, of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, and defense attorney John Wesley
Hall, said they got a tip that four other men were beaten. The
attorneys and their staffs interviewed Nolan McCoy, Frankie Webb,
Donald Lewis and Randy Mitchell concerning the allegations. Three
of the four men are state inmates.
   ``They were beaten _ several were bloodied in the beatings that
were inflicted,'' the attorneys said in Tuesday's pleading. ``They
were threatened with guns, often thrust into their faces, and they
were kicked. All were pushed and shoved and knocked around. They
were terrorized racially, threatened with hanging and with being
killed and thrown in the river, they were called `nigger,' they had
a barrage of pejorative epithets thrown their way. And they were
all told, `We know you were involved.'''
   A spokesman for the lower court said a date for the hearing had
yet to be set.
   The hearing Tuesday was conducted by telephone conference in the
Little Rock office of Judge Richard S. Arnold. Judges Donald Ross
of Omaha, Neb., and Frank Magill of Fargo, N.D., participated.

<HEAD>Dentist With AIDS Sends Warning Letters to Ex-Patients</HEAD>

   A dentist believed to have given a
patient AIDS during a tooth extraction has sent others he once
treated a warning letter suggesting they get tested for the virus.
   ``I am sorry I cannot tell you this face to face, but I am dying
of this disease,'' wrote Dr. David J. Acer of Stuart. ``I am very
close to the end.''
   The Centers for Disease Control last month reported that a
21-year-old woman contracted AIDS during a dental visit, the
nation's first known instance of a health professional apparently
giving the disease to a patient.
   The agency did not identify the dentist or the patient and said
it was not clear how the virus was transmitted.
   ``I do not understand how such a thing could have happened, and
I do not believe it did happen,'' Acer wrote. ``I am a gentle man,
and I would never intentionally expose anyone to this disease.''
   The dentist sent a copy of the letter to the state Department of
Health and Rehabilitative Services, which released it Tuesday. It
was unclear how many he sent to former patients.
   The letter does not say when Acer learned he had AIDS or how
long he practiced afterward. He said he stopped when he got
AIDS-related cancer.
   Acer, whose telephone number is unlisted, could not be reached
for comment.
   While HRS never publicly confirmed that the dentist in the CDC
report practiced in Florida, the agency said it had the ability to
track down patients and urge them to take an AIDS test.
   But under state confidentiality laws, HRS would be prevented
from telling the patients that their connection to the dentist had
prompted the advice.
   Acer said he consulted experts after testing positive for the
AIDS virus and was assured he could continue practicing. Among the
guidelines he followed were those from the CDC itself such as
wearing gloves and a mask, he said.
   Acer said he did not suffer a puncture wound that could have
exposed the patient to infected blood.
   ``Because I was aware that I had the HIV virus, I was extremely
careful in how I practiced dentistry,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, Acer said he understood that former patients could
be frightened and suggested they contact health authorities for
testing and counseling.
   ``I have cared for people all my life, and to infect anyone with
this disease would be contrary to everything I have stood for,'' he
wrote. ``I am sorry if the news story has caused you fear and
worry.''
   A 22-year-old woman identified only as K.B. has taken steps to
sue a ``Dr. D.A.'' for malpractice in state court in Palm Beach,
according to court papers. A motion says the woman went to the
dentist in 1987 and contracted AIDS from him.
   The lawsuit has yet to be filed. The motion asked that the woman
be allowed to testify via videotape because she is in the advanced
stages of the disease. A judge granted the request last month.

   Israelis awoke the other day to a new bumper
sticker: ``Come on Saddam, Step on the Gas.''
   The slogan was an example of the macabre humor that has cropped
up as Israelis try to cope with the tension and uncertainty born of
threats from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's to attack them with
chemical weapons.
   Both Saddam and chemical weapons have become sources of gallows
humor. A new T-shirt features a picture of Saddam with the legend
``Wanted for murder, jaywalking and armed robbery.''
   A popular theme for satirists and cartoonists are the
long-snouted gas masks to be distributed to civilians in case of an
Iraqi attack.
   The jokes began after Saddam first issued his threat in April,
saying he would annihilate half of Israel with binary chemical
weapons if Israel were to attack his country with nuclear weapons.
   State-controlled television picked up the theme in a skit that
also played on the heated political horse-trading going on then to
form a new government. It showed several friends wearing gas masks
and playing cards.
   As the camera zoomed in on one of the players, he lifted his
mask and said with a sigh of admiration: ``That Saddam is an OK
guy. Thanks to him, you can't smell the stink of the politics in
this place.''
   Saddam's invasion of Kuwait last month, followed by an
acrimonious public debate about whether to distribute gas masks at
once, provided humorists with fresh material.
   The mass circulation Maariv newspaper ran a two-page spread of
cartoons called ``Gas Masks in Our Daily Lives.'' One of the frames
showed an attack dog running away from a mailman wearing a gas mask.
   A popular prime time television show featured a wife at the
dinner table complaining about the husband's noisy eating habits.
The camera then turned to the husband, his face covered by a gas
mask with strands of spaghetti dangling from the nose filter.
   ``You try eating through this thing,'' he said angrily.
   Israelis, surrounded by hostile Arab states and hardened by the
wars they endured during the country's four decades, are a
responsive audience.

<HEAD>Post Meets with Unions, Sets Sept. 15 Deadline for Negotiations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN MATTHEWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Post management told its unions Tuesday
that the paper had to have a cost cutting plan by the end of next
week and indicated the continued publication of the nation's oldest
daily was at stake.
   Post Vice President and General Manager Richard T. Nasti said
after a meeting with leaders of the paper's 10 unions that the
paper has set Sept. 15 as a deadline for reaching agreement. He
said he was optimistic the deadline will be met.
   Nasti didn't say specifically what would happen if the deadline
weren't met.
   Theodore Kheel, a labor mediator and unpaid adviser a union
group who attended the meeting, said he understood that management
would suspend publication Sept 15 if it couldn't reach agreement
with the unions on $17 million in savings.
   The paper's 900 employees and 10 unions are represented by the
Allied Printing Trades Council.
   The council's president, George McDonald, said management ``told
us they are losing money, and they are looking for some relief from
the unions.'' The losses have been blamed in part on the city's
slumping economy.
   Publisher Peter Kalikow called the meeting and said through a
spokesman the session was ``very cordial, not a hostile meeting,
with both sides trying to work it out.''
   The Post offered to open its books to its 10 unions, and
meetings with individual unions are scheduled throughout Wednesday
and Thursday.
   In a prepared statement, Nasti said management officials would
meet with each union ``for lengthy and detailed explanations of
their cost saving proposals.''
   ``This newspaper has served New York for 190 years and through a
cooperative effort between labor and management it will continue to
serve New York for another 190 years,'' he said.
   Kalikow must find $25 million in annual savings to continue
publishing the paper, Nasti said.
   Kheel said the $17 million figure is the amount the Post hopes
to save through cost-cutting measures affecting its unions, with
the rest to be made up in other ways.
   Kalikow took over the Post from Rupert Murdoch in 1988 when the
paper was losing about $3 million monthly. Concessions from the
unions were part of the package that Murdoch had to achieve in
order to meet Kalikow's terms.
   Those same unions are now involved in intense negotiations with
the rival Daily News of New York. The News is seeking contracts
that would allow management to institute a variety of cost saving
measures that the News says are critical to its survival.

<HEAD>Meat Industry Fighting Projected Layoff of USDA Inspectors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department's food guardians
are getting steady pressure from the meat industry to soften the
round of inspection layoffs that will occur next month if Congress
and the White House fail to reach a budget agreement.
   But the plan for furloughing thousands of federal meat and
poultry inspectors for several days every two-week pay period
beginning Oct. 1, the start of fiscal year 1991, is still in
effect, officials said Tuesday.
   ``The die is cast and unless something is done, the furlough
will take place,'' said spokesman Jim Greene of the department's
Food Safety and Inspection Service.
   Last week, the inspection agency notified the nation's 6,300
federally inspected meat and poultry plants that the initial layoff
order by President Bush would be for a maximum of 36 hours during
the Oct. 1-14 period.
   Agency Administrator Lester Crawford said the layoffs ``would
effectively shut down'' plants during the furlough periods.
   The White House, meanwhile, said it is willing to listen to
proposals for a budget reduction of less than $50 billion, the
current target under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   Budget negotiators will resume talks in private at Andrews Air
Force Base, Md., in hopes of reaching an agreement by Sunday.
   Meanwhile, if layoffs take effect on Oct. 1 as currently
planned, it could mean hardships for the industry and consumers,
said the American Meat Institute, a trade association.
   ``Furloughs are not the answer,'' said institute President J.
Patrick Boyle. ``At best, it would take years for the industry and
the economy to recover the losses generated from furloughs of the
magnitude being discussed for fiscal 1991.''
   The meat and poultry industry asked Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter to find alternative methods of coping with the
inspection agency's budget problems, including the possibility of
giving inspectors priority status so they could keep production
lines moving.
   ``Closing factory doors has unacceptable costs, not only to
plant workers, who would be denied their jobs, but to consumers,
who would be denied essential food products, and to the government,
which would be denied additional tax revenues,'' the groups told
Yeutter.
   A shutdown of one day would idle 356,000 workers, halt livestock
and poultry purchases from producers, and cost nearly $1 billion in
lost sales throughout the marketing chain, they said.
   However, FSIS Administrator Crawford said the industry's request
for giving inspectors priority for remaining on the job would not
work.
   ``In plant inspectors, import inspectors and circuit supervisors
comprise 82 percent of our work force,'' he said. ``The remaining
18 percent represents laboratory technicians, compliance officers,
label reviewers and administrative staff that are essential to
carrying out the FSIS label.''
   About 88 percent of the agency's budget is salaries, Crawford
said. And 4.6 percent of its money is for fixed, non-salary costs
that must be paid with or without a furlough.

   Spraying chemicals to kill grasshoppers on
land set aside under the Conservation Reserve Program is not
expected to have significant harmful effects, according to studies
by the Agriculture Department.
   The environmental assessments by USDA involved CRP land in
Idaho, western Minnesota and the Dakotas, a region of severe
grasshopper infestation, officials said Tuesday.
   Land in the program is taken from crop production for 10 years
and planted to protective grass and trees.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said CRP land ``poses an extremely
inviting target to grasshoppers, which can consume all vegetation
in an infested area.''
   The assessments were made under an assumption that grasshoppers
will be controlled through an integrated pest management program
using several methods, including spraying with malathion, carbaryl
and acephate, as well as using baits containing carbaryl or Nosema
locustae.
   However, Glosser said the use of Nosema, a biological control
agent, will not be used on CRP land this year because it ``does not
achieve the quick knockdown'' of grasshoppers needed to protect
nearby crops.
   The assessments were said to cover effects on human health,
endangered species, other wildlife, water resources, aquatic
species, soil, vegetation, air quality, land use, cultural
resources and economic concerns.

   A new mechanical Big Foot with legs and feet
instead of wheels is being developed to prowl forests, the
Agriculture Department says.
   The vehicle ``will soon be strolling about the woods of
southwest Virginia'' near Blacksburg, home of Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University, one of the machine's developers,
the department said Tuesday.
   Products technologist Robert Koeppen of the Forest Service said
the machine could solve some forest management problems while
helping protect forest ecosystems.
   Currently, forest managers depend on rubber-tired vehicles,
which can cause soil compaction, rutting or damage to vegetation,
the agency said. Wheeled vehicles also are limited by terrain that
is too rough, steep, wet or soft.
   The machine, called ``the robotic walking vehicle,'' may
alleviate such problems. For example, it can move sideways, a
maneuver Koeppen said may help drastically reduce damage to forest
soils and vegetation.
   A public unveiling of the machine has been scheduled for Sept.
11 at Virginia Tech, with field tests to begin later this month.
The tests will include the machine's performance on level,
mountainous and simulated low-lying wetland terrain.

<HEAD>Study Says Capital Gains Tax Cut Would Favor Wealthy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One percent of American families would save an
average $19,599 from a proposed capital gains tax cut while 80
percent would face higher taxes to pay for the benefits, according
to a private analysis released today.
   ``The four-fifths of American families whose incomes are below
$61,000 would receive an average capital gains tax benefit of only
$30,'' according to the study by Citizens for Tax Justice, a
coalition of labor, public interest and citizens groups.
   ``Since most families own no capital assets other than their
homes, most actually would get no capital gains tax break at all,''
it said. These people ``would face higher taxes to pay for the cost
of this enormous new loophole for the very wealthy.''
   Those whose incomes place them in the top 1 percent would get an
average tax cut of $19,599, it said.
   The Washington-based Citizens for Tax Justice describes itself
as a non-profit, non-partisan coalition working for fairer taxes at
the federal, state and local levels.
   Capital gains are profits from the sale of stock, real estate
and other investments. They now are taxed at the same rates that
apply to wages and other income.
   President Bush has made cutting the tax a top priority,
contending such a reduction is needed to keep the economy growing.
His administration has pressed for a reduction during this year's
budget negotiations with members of Congress. The talks are due to
resume this week.
   The administration has never denied that the wealthiest
taxpayers would be the biggest beneficiaries of a capital gains tax
cut. But it contends that the proposed tax cut would spur
investment and create jobs.
   The Treasury has projected the cut would raise tax collections
every year and by $12.5 billion over the 1990-95 period. However,
the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation forecasts annual
revenue losses after the first two years and losses totaling $11.4
billion for 1990-95.
   The Congressional Budget Office last week said a capital gains
tax reduction ``could not be counted on'' to give a significant
boost to American economic growth.
   ``It is unlikely that the increase in income would generate
enough additional tax revenue'' to offset losses to the Treasury,
it said.
   Citizens for Tax Justice said middle-class Americans would not
benefit from a capital gains tax cut because their incomes come
mainly from salaries and wages, not from stock portfolios or real
estate holdings.
   ``The wealthy are the only ones who benefit from reduced taxes
on asset sales because they own the lion's share of the assets in
the first place,'' it said.
   The analysis also suggested that because the wealthy in
California, New York, Texas, Florida, Illinois and New Jersey are
so much richer and more numerous than in other states, more than
half of the cuts would go to residents of those six states.

<HEAD>`Ghost' is Top Hit of the Summer</HEAD>

   ``Ghost,'' once considered a vanishing act
next to the summer blockbusters, outlived all of them to close as
the summer's biggest smash and the top hit of the Labor Day weekend.
   The spectral love story starring Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and
Whoopi Goldberg took in $10 million over the holiday weekend,
Exhibitor Relations Co. reported Tuesday.
   The superhero flick ``Darkman'' took second place over the
weekend with $7.9 million, followed by the courtroom thriller
``Presumed Innocent,'' which made $5.9 million.
   ``Ghost'' has made more money than any other film released this
summer, grossing $125 million since it opened July 20.
   Seven films had more lucrative opening weeks: ``Total Recall,''
``Die Hard 2: Die Harder,'' ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Back to the Future
Part III,'' ``Another 48 HRS.,'' ``Days of Thunder'' and ``Bird on
a Wire.''
   But in the end, business for all seven films declined while
``Ghost'' remained relatively steady.
   Overall, this summer was the second biggest in Hollywood
history, with North American moviegoers spending about $1.85
billion.
   Box-office analyst A.D. Murphy of Daily Variety said Tuesday
that the summer's gross represented a 9 percent decline from last
year's record $2.04 billion.
   Among the more surprising failures this season was ``Days of
Thunder,'' which scarcely broke the $80 million mark. Paramount
blamed the collapse of the Tom Cruise movie on the historical
unpopularity of race-car movies.
   Disappointing returns were also reported by ``Gremlins 2: The
New Batch,'' ``Ghost Dad,'' ``Quick Change,'' ``My Blue Heaven,''
``Cadillac Man,'' ``Air America,'' ``Fire Birds,'' ``The Adventures
of Ford Fairlane,'' ``Betsy's Wedding,'' ``The Two Jakes'' and
``RoboCop 2.''
   The summer's top 10 films, in order, were ``Ghost,'' $125
million; ``Total Recall,'' $116.7 million; ``Die Hard 2: Die
Harder,'' $109.7 million; ``Dick Tracy,'' $103.7 million; ``Back to
the Future Part III,'' $84.1 million; ``Days of Thunder,'' $80.6
million; ``Another 48 HRS.,'' $79.1 million; ``Bird on a Wire,''
$70 million; ``Presumed Innocent,'' $67.4 million, and
``Arachnophobia,'' $48.4 million.
   ``Pretty Woman'' made $59.5 million during the summer but was a
spring release, opening March 23.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Monday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Ghost,'' Paramount, $10 million, 1,766 screens, $5,636 per
screen, $125 million, eight weeks.
   2. ``Darkman,'' Universal, $7.9 million, 1,833 screens, $4,330
per screen, $19.2 million, two weeks.
   3. ``Presumed Innocent,'' Warner Bros. $5.9 million, 1,355
screens, $4,319 per screen, $67.4 million, six weeks.
   4. ``Flatliners,'' Columbia, $5.2 million, 1,479 screens, $3,536
per screen, $40.1 million, four weeks.
   5. ``My Blue Heaven,'' Warner Bros., $3.2 million, 1,502
screens, $2,118 per screen, $18 million, three weeks.
   6. ``Men at Work,'' Epic-Triumph, $3.1 million, 1,035 screens,
$2,974 per screen, $7.7 million, two weeks.
   7. ``Taking Care of Business,'' Disney, $2.8 million, 1,176
screens, $2,396 per screen, $13.2 million, three weeks.
   8. ``Exorcist III,'' 20th Century Fox, $2.7 million, 1,297
screens, $2,125 per screen, $20.8 million, three weeks.
   9. ``Young Guns II,'' 20th Century Fox, $2.4 million, 1,321
screens, $1,812 per screen, $34.3 million, five weeks.
   10. ``The Witches,'' Warner Bros., $2.3 million, 879 screens,
$2,618 per screen, $5.8 million, two weeks.

<HEAD>North Prosecutor Asks Appellate Panel to Reconsider Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh wants
a federal appeals court to reconsider its split decision that set
aside three felony convictions against former White House aide
Oliver L. North.
   Calling the 2-1 decision ``unprecedented and unwarranted,'' the
independent counsel asked the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of Colombia to rehear the case. Walsh
also suggested a rehearing by all 12 members of the court.
   The tartly worded petition charged that Circuit Judges Laurence
Silberman and David Sentelle used faulty logic and ``a plain
misreading of the record'' in the case to set aside North's
convictions.
   Over the dissent of Chief Judge Patricia Wald, the two appeals
judges ordered a hearing to determine if trial witnesses were
influenced by the testimony that North gave Congress under a
limited grant of immunity from prosecution.
   The so-called ``use immunity'' granted by the congressional
Iran-Contra committees barred Walsh from using North's televised
testimony as evidence or for leads in his investigation.
   Walsh called the panel's order ``an unwarranted extension of use
immunity protection'' that was ``particularly unjustified'' because
he took special precautions to make sure that prosecutors were not
exposed to North's testimony. Trial witnesses were instructed by
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to testify only from their
personal knowledge.
   The prohibitions against prosecuting based on North's immunized
testimony ``do not extend to the independent conduct of third-party
witnesses, particularly witnesses who testify on the basis of
personal knowledge,'' Walsh said in the petition.
   To conduct the hearing according to the appellate panel's
instructions, Gesell would have to ``probe the psychological
processes of each witness, many of whom are irrelevant to the
conviction,'' Walsh said.
   The standards the appellate court set for a ``witness by
witness'' hearing would make ```virtually impossible' the criminal
prosecution of a person who provides public immunized testimony,''
Walsh said, quoting from Wald's dissent.
   North, a former National Security Council aide who coordinated
secret support for the Nicaraguan Contras, was convicted of aiding
and abetting the obstruction of Congress, destruction or alteration
of government documents and accepting an illegal gratuity _ the
construction of a security fence around his house.
   North was fined $150,000 and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of
community service.
   If it is allowed to stand, the July 20 appellate court decision
could invalidate the five felony convictions of North's old boss,
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter, who is
appealing his six-month sentence.
   The retired Navy rear admiral, who was convicted of lying to
Congress about the Iran-Contra affair, also gave immunized
testimony on Capitol Hill.
   Walsh filed the petition Tuesday as prosecutors from his office
began trying a tax case against a former CIA agent who participated
in the sale of U.S. arms to Iran.
   Thomas Clines, who assisted retired Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord
and arms dealer Albert Hakim, is accused of not fully reporting on
his income-tax forms the commissions he earned from the arms deals.
Prosecutors claim that Clines earned $875,000 from the
arms-for-hostages sales.
   Both Secord and Hakim, who have pleaded guilty to other
Iran-Contra charges, are expected to testify against Clines at the
trial in federal court in Baltimore.

<HEAD>Greyhound Drivers' Strike Benefits Terminated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Greyhound drivers' union is cutting off
$50-a-week strike benefits for those still waging a 6-month-old
strike because it says it needs the union's remaining money for
legal battles.
   The halt of benefits for the union's 6,000 drivers ``should not
be taken by anyone as a signal that we are abandoning the strike or
the campaign we have been waging,'' Amalgamated Transit Union
President Jim La Sala said in a letter released Tuesday.
   The union already has spent more than $6 million on the strike,
according the letter to local union leaders.
   Strike benefits have to be discontinued starting Sept. 13, La
Sala said, because the union's so-called ``defense fund'' was about
to drop below $2 million.
   Remaining resources are needed for legal fights, the union's
involvement in bankruptcy proceedings and its buyout effort, La
Sala said.
   ``I can fully understand that many of our members manning the
picket lines may well feel betrayed. ... To the contrary, this
union has made a pledge that Greyhound will never operate in a
picket-free environment so long as our strike continues,'' La Sala
said.
   Frank Motsay, president of Local 1610 in Washington, said
drivers knew the strike benefits eventually would run out and that
he did not expect it to affect morale on the picket line.
   ``I think it's only natural to assume that none of these things
have a bottomless pit. Fifty dollars a week is not what's keeping
them out on the picket line. ... Our people are out their for a
just cause, to improve their working condition and wages,'' Motsay
said.
   Many of the striking drivers have found other jobs since the
strike began or are receiving unemployment benefits that exceed the
$50-a-week union benefit, La Sala's letter said.
   Greyhound drivers walked out March 2 in a dispute over wages and
job security. Since the dispute began, Greyhound has operated a
reduced schedule with about 3,000 strikebreakers it hired and has
said it has no plans to resume negotiations with union drivers.
   The bus line, now in the protection of bankruptcy court, has
been hurt financially as well. It blames its money troubles on
security and legal costs that stem from initial strike violence
that it charges was orchestrated by union leaders.
   La Sala's letter said that if strike benefits were continued,
the international union's defense fund would be in jeopardy and
forced assessments might cause the ``total destruction'' of some
local unions.
   While the bus line has said the strike is in effect over because
Greyhound has continued operations with replacement drivers, the
union is hoping for other possible solutions.
   Those include the possibility that a bankruptcy judge might
replace Greyhound Chairman Fred G. Currey with a trustee willing to
resume negotiations with union drivers. Another possible solution
would be for a New York investment banking firm, the Blackstone
Group, to take over the company. The firm already has said a
takeover would include bringing union drivers back and possibly
allowing employees to have part ownership.
   In addition, there's the chance that a National Labor Relations
Board administrative law judge in Milwaukee will agree with the
board's general counsel and find that Greyhound engaged in unfair
labor practices. That would mean the bus line would have to take
back the union _ and give drivers back pay amounting to as much as
$10 million a month. However, the bus line has already said it
would appeal such a decision, which could mean court battles for
years.
   Greyhound contends its financial problems will be resolved with
a reorganization plan that streamlines the company's operations.

<HEAD>Some in Washington Say a Single Bullet Could Resolve the Problem</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is the
latest administration official to suggest that the United States
would welcome Saddam Hussein's departure from office. In Iraq, such
leavetakings ordinarily come by way of the assassin's bullet.
   The idea of ending the Persian Gulf crisis by having Saddam
killed is much discussed in Washington. Some see it as an
alternative to a brutal war that would kill thousands of Iraqis and
Americans alike to achieve the same end.
   As might be expected, no one in the executive branch is openly
advocating Saddam's murder.
   For one thing, assassinations are a violation of American
policy, first enunciated in writing by President Ford 14 years ago
in response to suspicions that Americans had a hand in the murder
of the leftist president of Chile, Salvadore Allende.
   For another, the experts _ including three former CIA directors
_ say it would be extremely difficult to arrange.
   Saddam is on guard. He has survived dozens of assassinations
attempts. He came to office through that route. That's how leaders
normally rise in his country.
   The Wall Street Journal quoted Sahib al-Hakin, an Iraqi
dissident in London, as saying that removing Saddam would not make
much difference because those around him who might take over are as
ruthless.
   Baker told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday that
it would not make the administration ``terribly unhappy if the
people of Iraq decided they wanted a new leader.''
   But, he added, that's ``up to the people of Iraq ....''
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., is as forthright as anyone in saying
the U.S. goal should be Saddam's removal. ``It seems to me
important that Saddam Hussein must either leave or be removed,'' he
said.
   President Bush, asked about Lugar's view, said last week that he
had ``great respect for Dick Lugar'' but added that he had not
altered his ``publicly stated'' objectives, of which Saddam's
removal is not one.
   Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger has written that
``any outcome that leaves Saddam Hussein in place and his military
machine unimpaired might turn out to be only an interlude between
aggressions.''
   Early in the crisis, Bush himself said he hoped the Iraqi people
would ``do something'' unless Saddam ``changes his spots.''
   But former CIA Director Stansfield Turner said assassinations
offend American morality and can backfire.
   ``I don't think an American could possibly kill Saddam Hussein
and survive, so you'd end up hiring someone else and who knows what
they might do,'' Turner said. ``They might kill 5,000 people to get
Hussein. It's a very chancy thing.''
   Richard Helms, another ex-CIA chief, said, ``When push comes to
shove, Americans don't believe in having America assassinate
foreign leaders. They want somebody else to pull the trigger.''
   And William Colby, who also once ran the agency, said that Bush
clearly hopes the economic squeeze on Iraq will become so severe
that within the country ``people will get the idea, `we've got to
get rid of this guy.'''
   Once before _ in the Panama invasion that resulted in the arrest
of Manuel Noriega _ Bush suggested that the people themselves
remove his antagonist. But when Panamanian military leaders plotted
a coup and sought American help, signals got crossed and the
attempt failed.
   Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla. a member of the House Intelligence
Committee, was asked as he was leaving on a trip to visit U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia last week about Saddam's removal.
   ``The future of Saddam Hussein is of concern to everyone, the
potential power and resources he would have available,'' the
congressman said. ``You fear his ability to regroup.''
   But as far as an assassination, McCurdy said simply, ``That's
out of our hands.''
   Shirheen T. Hunter, a Mideast expert at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington, said she did not think
U.S. intelligence forces ``have the kind of network inside Iraq
that we can pull this kind of thing.''
   Saddam, she said, ``is extremely heavily guarded. His security
forces are loyal _ mostly his relatives or members of his village.
... I don't think it is a serious policy option.''
   The Ford executive order directs that no one ``employed by or
acting on behalf of the United States government shall engage in,
or conspire to engage in, assassination.''
   Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan renewed the order. Bush has not,
but it remains in effect.
   It is a policy, not a law, however, and carries no penalty. Bush
could revoke it, publicly or secretly, or simply override it by
ordering an assassination effort.

   To the hundreds of millions of Moslems
who live outside the Arab world, Saddam Hussein is generally
considered either a demon or a ``champion of Islam.''
   Some perceive the Iraqi president a hero. Others call him a
tyrant and fear he will bring disaster to the Persian Gulf, cradle
of the Moslem faith.
   Nearly two-thirds of the world's estimated 1 billion Moslems are
non-Arabs. They live in a crescent that reaches from the sands and
jungles of black Africa to the steppes of Central Asia and juts out
to islands in the Pacific Ocean.
   The non-Arab Moslems, like their co-religionists in the Middle
East, are divided in their opinion of Saddam and the presence of
U.S. troops in the gulf.
   Some despise him.
   Some have given him a new name _ ``Saddma'' Hussein. ``Saddma''
means sorrow in the Urdu language spoken by many Moslems in India
and Pakistan. Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait has brought misery
and fears of greater poverty to a half-million South Asians who
worked there.
   Some revere him.
   In Bangladesh, where Moslems account for 90 percent of the 110
million people, the government has promised to send 1,200 soldiers
to Saudi Arabia to guard against further Iraqi aggression. But at
least 5,500 civilians have volunteered to fight on the Iraqi side
if war breaks out.
   ``I have offered to fight for Iraq because President Saddam
Hussein is a champion of Islamic revivalism,'' said Mohammad
Faisal, a businessman in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital.
   In predominantly Hindu India, whose 105 million Moslems give it
the second-largest Moslem population of any country in the world,
the Iraqi consul general in Bombay has compiled a list of Moslem
volunteers, the Sunday Mail newspaper reported.
   ``We intend to call up these reserves if and when the need
arises,'' Amer Naji, the consul general, said.
   In New Delhi, hundreds of Moslems emerging from their weekly
prayers on Friday burned an effigy of President Bush to protest the
American deployment in Saudi Arabia.
   In Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, the Islamic Council for the
Defense of the Holy Land called a rally to deplore the Iraqi
invasion. The 2,000 demonstrators also called on the United States
to withdraw from the gulf. Indonesia, with 162 million Moslems, is
the largest Moslem country in the world.
   The country's largest Moslem organization, Muhannadiyah, has
urged the Americans not to take any arbitrary action.
   ``The U.S. presence is not genuinely aimed at defending the
interest of an invaded country,'' said Yuwono Subarsong, dean of
the political faculty of the Indonesian University.
   He said Washington only wants to ensure its oil supply ``to
maintain the American way of life.''
   In Pakistan, a Moslem state with 103 million adherents of the
religion, a poll of 700 people showed 74 percent supported the
government's decision to send troops to Saudi Arabia while 11
percent opposed it. But the same poll showed 62 percent opposed the
presence of American forces in Saudi Arabia, home of the Moslem
world's most sacred shrines.
   In the past two weeks, Moslem fundamentalists have staged noisy
but non-violent anti-American protests in Islamabad, Karachi and
other cities.
   In India, the government avoided direct criticism of Saddam and
thanked him for helping some of the 180,000 Indian workers in
Kuwait and Iraq return home. But posters have appeared in the Jama
Masjid, a New Delhi mosque that is one of the world's largest,
asking Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   In Malaysia, where 45 percent of the country's 17.8 million
people are Moslem, the government has backed the United Nations
sanctions against Iraq. But the opposition Pan Islamic Party held a
demonstration calling for U.S. withdrawal.
   Most West African nations with large Moslem populations have
either remained silent or criticized Iraq initially and then kept
quiet.
   Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with 119 million people,
half of them Moslem, has said very little about the invasion. But
it has defied Saddam's orders to close its embassy in Kuwait.
   In Uganda, Moslem leaders have criticised Hussein.
   Umar Kaggwa, a Kampala businessman, said he thought Saddam
should have learned a lesson from former Ugandan leader Gen. Idi
Amin, who invaded Tanzania and precipitatated his own downfall in
1978.
   ``I think Saddam is mad,'' Kaggwa said.

   A silent semicircle of men stood in a
room with dirt floors and unfinished walls. At their center, a
candle heated a coffee can holding five tear gas tablets.
   One by one, as if in some initiation ceremony, the men drank
from hoses in cumbersome gas masks, then took them off, counted to
10, spelled their last name and recited their Social Security
numbers.
   Voices cracked halfway through the litany.
   This mild torture suffered by the 14 members of the 265th
Quartermaster Detachment is part of regular training for all U.S.
soldiers.
   But for the water purification unit of the South Carolina
National Guard, the session in the post's gas chamber had added
significance. It marked the end of chemical warfare training meant
to prepare the unit for Mideast duty.
   Mobilized for deployment last week, the Allendale, S.C., unit
had spent four of six training days brushing up on NBC _ nuclear,
biological and chemical warfare.
   The men heard lectures and watched movies about the effects of
nerve agents, choking gases and blister gas. They walked in
90-degree heat wearing gas masks, hoods, overboots and bulky
chemical warfare suits.
   The gas chamber was a final stop to show the men their equipment
worked.
   With masks on, the tear gas had little effect. When masks came
off, the air in the dim room felt red hot, as if the candle's heat
was everywhere. The exposed faces went through escalating degrees
of pain, from the sensation of a slight sunburn to that of flayed
flesh.
   A quick walk into the outside breeze and a splash of water from
a canteen cleared it away.
   ``Stings a little, but it wasn't so bad,'' said Mark Rooker, at
20 the youngest member of the unit.
   To celebrate the 265th's graduation, 2nd Army commander Lt. Gen.
James Crysel came by the chamber.
   Crysel, whose command includes the federalized 265th, stood
downwind from the chamber, impervious to its fumes. He spoke to
several of the men about their unit and their families.
   The men, looking like mole people in their chemical warfare
mufti, gave muffled answers.
   The 265th's men were assured all through training that the
equipment can save their lives. The bigger problem is functioning
as a soldier in the claustrophobia of the mask and overgarments
that quickly leave a man soaked through with sweat and smeared with
the charcoal from the suit's liner.
   ``Some people get an attitude in the mask,'' said Sgt. Van
Toliver, a post instructor, warned the group. ``It makes you
angry.''
   Before the gas chamber session, the men spent an hour in suits
and masks, practicing the frustrating task of swapping contaminated
protective clothes for fresh ones.
   When the sweat-drenched men finally removed their masks the
anger Sgt. Toliver warned of was obvious.
   ``They throw gas at us when we're over there and we're going to
die,'' said Ulysses Calhoun, one of the unit's younger members.
``Might as well take off the mask and get it over with.''
   Not everyone agreed.
   ``I'll stay with the mask,'' said Sgt. Hullie Cohen, a guardsman
for 16 years. ``I plan to do what I can to survive.''
   Cohen, a burly 40-year-old brick mason, often breaks a moment of
tension with a joke. He is equally deliberate on the basketball
court, choosing his shots while the unit's younger members gun for
impossible baskets. It seems he rarely misses.
   It was Cohen's first time in the gas chamber. He was one of the
few who volunteered to go through again, this time without a mask.
   ``I just wanted to see what I could stand,'' he said. The gas
temporarily blinded him; he had to be led out.

<HEAD>Poll Finds Cranston's Popularity Sinking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston's popularity is
plummeting amid a Senate ethics committee probe of his intervention
with federal thrift regulators, a poll shows.
   A California Poll published in Tuesday's editions of the San
Francisco Chronicle found the 76-year-old Democrat was supported
for re-election by only 13 percent of those surveyed. Cranston's
current term ends in 1992 and he has said he plans to seek
re-election.
   Cranston was viewed unfavorably by 67 percent of those surveyed,
compared to 10 months ago when a similar survey showed he was
viewed favorably by 64 percent, according to the poll.
   Among Democrats, 65 percent said they were not inclined to
support Cranston, while 84 percent of Republicans and 74 percent of
those with no party affiliation said they were disinclined to vote
for him again.
   The poll questioned 468 registered voters from August 17-27. It
had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.
   Cranston, along with four other U.S. senators, is being
investigated by the ethics committee for intervening with federal
regulators on behalf of savings and loan operator Charles Keating.
   Keating made large contributions to all the senators, including
nearly $1 million to Cranston campaigns and causes. Cranston has
maintained the ethics committee probe will clear him of any

<HEAD>Nunn Changes His Position on Abortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia is changing his
position on the government's role in regulating abortion, saying
the decision should be left ``to the informed conscience of the
mother'' in most cases.
   Nunn, a conservative Democrat, previously had supported proposed
constitutional amendments to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973
decision legalizing abortion.
   But he now favors ``leaving the decision prior to viability (of
the fetus) to the informed conscience of the mother,'' Nunn wrote
in a letter to constituents.
   He favors prohibiting abortions after viability ``except in
cases where the life of the mother is threatened,'' the letter
added.
   ``While Roe vs. Wade was a questionable constitutional decision,
the viability standard it established may now be the best
legislative policy on abortion,'' said Nunn.
   Nunn is regarded as a potential presidential candidate in 1992.
   He began rethinking the abortion question after it became
apparent that changes in the makeup of the Supreme Court could
force Congress to decide when the government should intervene in
the abortion decision, said his press secretary, Scott Williams.
   In the letter, Nunn said he still considers abortion ``a tragedy
and an act of great moral consequence that should be strongly
discouraged except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of
the mother is endangered.''
   But he said he concluded that laws prohibiting early abortions
cannot be enforced because legalized abortion has been the law of
the land since the 1973 Supreme Court decision.

   Vice President Dan Quayle gave a boost to
Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt's re-election bid and declared that
governors' races around the country are ``the brass rings'' that
hold the key to redistricting.
   Alabama has ``led America in economic progress'' during the Hunt
administration, Quayle said Tuesday after attending a
$5,000-a-plate lunch to raise money for Hunt's campaign.
   Quayle said the gubernatorial races in Georgia, Alabama and
Texas are ``key races in the South.''
   ``With reapportionment coming up, the governorships are the
brass rings this year,'' the vice president said at a news
conference. ``They are the ones who are going to have a lot to say
about redistricting.''
   Hunt is the first Republican governor in Alabama since
Reconstruction. Hunt's Democratic challenger is teacher lobbyist
Paul Hubbert.
   Former President Reagan will visit Birmingham, Ala., Sept. 29 to
campaign for Hunt.

   Former Rep. Millicent Fenwick is now
the head of a GOP state senator's campaign for a U.S. House seat
that includes much of her old congressional district.
   Mrs. Fenwick, 80, was too ill to attend a news conference
Tuesday where she had planned to announce her involvement with the
campaign of state Sen. Dick Zimmer.
   ``As you may know, I am not taking on many public
responsibilities these days,'' Mrs. Fenwick said in a prepared
statement. ``Nevertheless, I have agreed to become chairperson of
Sen. Dick Zimmer's campaign for Congress from the 12th District,
which includes much of my old congressional district.''
   She gave up her seat in 1982 to run for the Senate. After losing
to Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., she served as the first American
ambassador to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
in Rome.
   Zimmer is facing Democrat Marguerite Chandler in a general
election bid to succeed retiring Republican Rep. James Courter in
the GOP-dominated district.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Gene Related To Primary Arthritis, NIH Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Ohio family in which nine members
developed a potentially crippling form of arthritis has helped
researchers isolate a gene that may be responsible for the
degenerative disease.
   Researchers led by Dr. Darwin J. Prockop of Thomas Jefferson
University in Philadelphia and Dr. Roland W. Moskowitz of Case
Western Reserve University in Cleveland surveyed the genetic
pattern of three generations of the family and found a faulty gene
that produces a protein mutation.
   The genetic flaw changes a single amino acid in the structure of
a component in cartilage and this leads to an early onset of
arthritis, Prockop said at a news conference Tuesday.
   ``We now know that a gene can cause the problem,'' said Prockop.
   Moskowitz said the gene apparently is not responsible for
osteoarthritis in all families where the disease is common.
   ``We think it is likely that other genes are involved,'' he said.
   The cause of primary osteoarthritis has long eluded science even
though it is one of the most common complaints among people past
the age of 55, affecting about 16 million Americans.
   The disease causes a breakdown or erosion of cartilage that
covers and cushions joints. It can affect any joint, but most
commonly the hands, ankles, knees and hips. Severe cases can lead
to crippling that can be corrected only by replacing the diseased
joint with an artificial one.
   Currently, treatment consists only of treating symptoms and
relieving inflammation.
   Prockop said that with the arthritis gene identified, scientists
now have a research target that could lead to drugs to prevent or
arrest the disease process. However, such drugs will take years to
develop, he said.
   In the family that was studied, Prockop said, the researchers
found that there was one defective gene and one good gene for the
production of collagen II, a protein that is the primary component
in cartilage. The defective gene substitutes an amino acid called
cysteine for one called arginine, he said. The result is an altered
and weaken collagen, and this leads to an early onset of arthritis.
   ``With this discovery, we hope to find ways to make the good
gene work better and the bad gene work less well,'' said Prockop.
   Researchers started studying the Ohio family, which was not
identified, after a physician referred them to Moskowitz.
   Three generations of the family, starting with the father in the
first generation, suffer from osteoarthritis.
   In the second generation, three brothers and one sister out of
seven children had the disease. Three in this group underwent joint
replacement surgery. And in the third generation, there were five
with arthritis. For some in the family, the disease symptoms
appeared at age 16.
   Using a tissue sample from one family member with arthritis, the
scientists isolated the collagen II gene and found that it was
mutated. They then checked that gene in the other family members
and found it was defective in the nine who were affected with
arthritis, but not in 10 others.
   Tests were conducted on 57 unrelated individuals without
arthritis and the defective gene was not found.
   Prockop said it is now possible to identify the gene from tissue
samples within four weeks and his laboratory hopes to develop tests
that can make a genetic diagnosis within two days. This would
enable members of a family where arthritis is common to determine
if they are susceptible to the disease.
   Moskowitz said that in expanded studies 10 families with several
generations of arthritis have been examined and the faulty gene has
been found in three of the groups. This suggests that the gene
found in the Ohio family is not the only one underlying arthritis.
   John D. Stobo, a Johns Hopkins University medical professor who
is president of the American College of Rheumatologists, said the
discovery ``provides real hope that a cure will be forthcoming.''
   Dr. Arthur I. Grayzel, senior vice president of the Arthritis
Foundation, said the new research ``has the potential for helping
change the concept of osteoarthritis from a disease that is the
inevitable consequence of aging to a disease that has a specific
cause in different people.''
   The research was supported in part by National Institute of
Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, one of the
National Institutes of Health.

   Rambo and Coca-Cola have made their
way to U.S. troops in the Saudi Arabian desert. And USO shows
should be coming soon.
   For news and entertainment-starved troops, a night at the
movies, no matter how old the movie, is a big deal.
   The treat came this past week for members of the 354th Tactical
Fighter Wing, who set up a movie tent to watch ``Rambo'' after the
unit secured a copy of the film.
   ``It was really great, we had popcorn and everything,'' said
Becky Colaw, the public information officer for the 354th, which is
based in Myrtle Beach, S.C.
   Cold Coke has been making its way to the troops over the past
several days as part of a $2 million corporate service and
entertainment campaign organized by the USO.
   The non-profit organization hopes to bring live entertainment to
the troops in the coming months.
   The Coke delivery effort has not been without snafus.
   The company arranged a media trip Tuesday for its delivery to
the 18th Airborne Corps but didn't tell unit commanders they were
coming.
   ``Let's just say they weren't too pleased,'' said an Army
officer who escorted the media to the site.

   Feeding the burgeoning American military force is a formidable
task.
   Early in the deployment, Saudi fast-food chains and other
outlets were contracted for some of the meals. And the troops
always had their high-calorie field rations _ Meals Ready to Eat _
to fall back on.
   But as time drags on the services are establishing more and more
field kitchens, with supplies flowing in daily.
   A walk past a row of pallets at an air base the other day
provided a menu preview: Elbow macaroni, cranberry sauce,
applesauce, dehydrated egg mix and nonfat dry milk.
   And for dessert?
   Devil's food cake with artificial vanilla icing.

   For the past three weeks, American military spokesmen and the
first reporters allowed into Saudi Arabia have been staying in a
hotel that also is the temporary home of dozens of Kuwaiti refugees.
   The Kuwaiti children, who play in the halls all day and well
into the morning hours, in the past few days have begun playing
with toy guns in the halls, often springing out from behind doors
and curtains to surprise hotel patrons.
   A Navy captain was walking down the hall with a reporter the
other day when one Kuwaiti boy jumped out from behind a pole and
fired a toy air gun in the direction of the captain.
   The captain then admonished the boy, telling him not to aim the
gun at anyone.
   When he was done speaking, the captain stood for a second,
smiling at the boy. The boy re-cocked the air gun and fired a shot
at the captain's chest.
   ``He'll learn,'' said the captain, shaking his head as he walked
away.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Taking Off in New Air Force One</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has flown the equivalent of
eight times around the globe in his 20 months as president.
Starting this week, he'll be able to make the circuit without even
having to stop.
   The president who has traveled farther and more frequently than
any other chief executives at comparable points in their terms _ 17
countries and 40 states as president so far _ will get the ideal
accompanying piece of hardware. A plane capable of staying aloft a
week or more through midair refueling.
   Although nearly two years behind schedule, the new Air Force One
takes flight this week.
   Bush, a former Navy pilot, is expected to take his maiden flight
on the new plane _ a converted jumbo Boeing 747 _ on Thursday when
he gives speeches for Republican candidates in Topeka, Kan., and
Tallahassee, Fla.
   Then, he will use it this weekend when he flies to Helsinki,
Finland, for his one-day summit with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   While midair refueling is an option to be reserved for an
emergency, the new plane can fly 7,140 miles without refueling.
That's 1,400 miles farther than the present Air Force One, a
20-year-old Boeing 707.
   It also carries state-of-the-art communications systems, an
anti-missile system, collision-avoidance equipment and is designed
to protect electronic systems after a nuclear explosion.
   The new plane also has:
   _ Eighty-five telephones.
   _ Twin beds in the president's stateroom, a changing room and a
shower.
   _ A built-in movie screen and projection systems.
   _ Refrigerator-freezers that can hold a week's supply of food
for 70 passengers and 23 crew members.
   _ A private office for the president with eight large chairs and
a sofa.
   _ Seven lavatories.
   _ A medical emergency room.
   _ Two copying machines and television, videocassette and stereo
systems.
   Although the plane originally was intended to be ready for
President Reagan's return trip to California in January 1989, it
seems more made-to-order for Bush.
   What other president would expect to take in both Kansas and
Florida and call it a day trip, for instance? Or fly to Finland for
lunch?
   ``Look out world, here we come,'' Bush's press secretary, Marlin
Fitzwater, said in announcing that the new plane was ready.
   The new Air Force One _ and an identical backup plane to be
delivered in June 1991 _ were built by Boeing at Everett, Wash.,
and spent most of the past three years at Boeing's plant in
Wichita, Kan., for outfitting.
   Boeing officials are expected to be on hand when the plane
touches down in Topeka on Thursday on its inaugural flight.
   Barring any unforeseen complications that would delay use of the
plane, its maiden flight will be ``a kind of triumphant return to
Kansas, its birthplace,'' Fitzwater said.
   Progress on the planes was delayed nearly two years primarily by
Boeing's efforts to equip the plane with wiring that could
withstand a nuclear blast, Boeing officials have said.
   The new plane has about twice as much wiring _ 1.26 million feet
_ as a commercial 747.
   Boeing signed a fixed-cost contract with the U.S. Air Force to
deliver both planes for $250 million, although the price later was
revised to about $266 million. Actual costs rose to close to $400
million, Air Force officials have said, with much of the overrun
being absorbed by Boeing.
   The larger planes also required construction of a new hangar at
Andrews Air Force Base, in the Maryland suburbs of Washington.
   The designation ``Air Force One'' does not relate to a specific
plane, but rather to whatever plane the president is riding on.
When he takes a small Gulfstream, as he sometimes does on the way
to Camp David, Md., that becomes ``Air Force One.''
   The first ``Air Force One'' was a four-engine piston-powered
DC-4 flown by Franklin Roosevelt in 1942 and dubbed ``Sacred Cow.''
   The new 747 will replace the current 707, Air Force No. 2700,
that is primarily used as Air Force One.
   The second plane will replace the backup 707 now used for
presidential travel, Air Force No. 2600, on which Lyndon Johnson
took the oath of office on Nov. 22, 1963.
   That plane, which Bush uses occasionally, is the first jet ever
used by a president.

<TEXT>
   The biggest payola case since the scandal
that ruined the careers of some of rock 'n' roll's top disc jockeys
30 years ago has been thrown out by a judge who ruled prosecutors
deliberately withheld evidence.
   U.S. District Judge James Ideman on Tuesday dismissed payola and
racketeering charges against independent record promoter Joseph
Isgro, 43, citing ``outrageous government misconduct.'' The trial
began Aug. 21.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William Lynch said he will appeal.
   Isgro was on trial on 57 counts of tax fraud, racketeering and
other charges. He was accused of paying cash and cocaine to radio
stations in Texas and California in return for playing certain
songs.
   The trial had featured testimony about cash and drugs stuffed
into album jackets and audio cassette cases delivered to radio
station executives.
   Ideman said prosecutors deliberately withheld from the defense
contradictory statements by a key witness, Dennis Di Ricco, a
former Internal Revenue Service agent convicted of tax conspiracy
and obstruction in 1989.
   Prosecutors had earlier denied hiding the testimony.
   ``Having been caught with a smoking pistol, the government,
which denied it had a pistol, then denied that the pistol smoked,''
the judge said.
   He declared a mistrial and dismissed the indictment. He also
threw out the case against Isgro's co-defendants, cocaine dealer
Jeffrey Monka, 32, and former Columbia Records executive Raymond
Anderson, 50.
   ``The government was willing to win at all costs and it got its
hand caught in the cookie jar,'' said defense attorney Don Re.
   The defense had discovered that Di Ricco, at his trial, denied
involvement in payola with Isgro, contradicting what he told the
grand jury that indicted Isgro.
   Isgro said he was ``relieved and happy'' the trial was over.
   Isgro's clients included Columbia, MCA, Warner Brothers, RCA and
Polygram Records.
   A 1960 federal law made it a crime punishable by a $10,000 fine
and up to a year in prison to offer money or other inducements to
give records airplay.
   The law followed a scandal that rocked the music industry in the
late 1950s and early '60s. The scandal led to congressional
hearings into the then-widespread practice of offering DJs
inducements to give certain records airplay.
   Among those called to testify were Dick Clark of ``American
Bandstand'' and Alan Freed, who is credited with inventing the term
rock 'n' roll.
   The investigation cost the careers of several top disc jockeys
of the era.

<TEXT>
   American Indian leaders want Congress to
approve a memorial to the warriors who fell at Little Big Horn and
Virginia officials are urging a national commission to help
preserve Civil War battlefields.
   ``We need to honor our warriors who gave their lives,'' Carol
Gipp of the National Congress of American Indians told the House
Interior Committee's subcommittee on national parks and public
lands.
   The appeal came Tuesday as Indians, conservationists and others
crowded the hearing room to plead for approval of favorite bills
before Congress adjourns next month.
   A memorial to the warriors who fell in the 1876 victory of the
Sioux over Lt. Col. George Custer and a detachment of the 7th
Cavalry Regiment would cost about $2.1 million, the National Park
Service has estimated. The service is supporting the memorial, as
yet undesigned.
   The memorial would be adjacent to the monument to the 7th
Cavalry which was erected on Last Stand Hill on the Montana
battlefield in 1881. It bears the full names of Custer and each of
the 224 other men in his command.
   Virginia officials and historic preservationists urged approval
of a national commission on civil war battlefields to help shield a
number of sites from development as the suburbs outside the
nation's capital spread southward.
   Mayor Elizabeth G. Helm of Winchester pointed to estimates that
employment in the Dulles Corridor outside Washington would grow
more than 1,000 percent and the homes of those joining the labor
force most likely would be in central Maryland and the northern
Shenandoah Valley.
   ``This same area is heavily steeped in history and tradition but
we have tended to take this heritage for granted,'' she said. ``We
have assumed that it will always be with us for future
generations.''

   Businesses should play a greater role in
improving schools by investing more dollars and personnel to boost
quality and prepare students for the workforce, according to a
nationwide poll.
   The Roper Organization poll was released Tuesday. Commissioned
by an affiliate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, it found 96
percent of Americans with children in public school, as well as 91
percent of all Americans, are concerned about the quality of
education in their communities.
   Three-quarters of those polled agreed that public schools are
failing to prepare students for jobs now available. Sixty-three
percent said most students will lack skills for jobs in the future.
   Most of the 1,003 adult Americans polled by telephone last month
were receptive to the involvement of business in local public
education. Ninety-one percent said it is a good idea for business
to provide equipment to schools, while 6 percent thought it was a
bad idea and 2 percent didn't know.

   Brinkley believes the guinea hens she is raising are eating the

singer Billy Joel. The ticks carry Lyme disease, which causes a
variety of symptoms and can be fatal.
   Rep. George Hochbrueckner quickly seized the (photo) opportunity

she let the hens wander.
   He said researchers will study whether the birds can tell the
difference between dog ticks and deer ticks. They will also try to
determine if the deer tick population is lower on the celebrity
property than at neighbors' homes.
   The hens are used in Africa to keep ticks out of barnyards,
Hochbrueckner said.

restaurant, Eddie Michaels said Tuesday.
   ``He had a tonsillectomy about two weeks ago, and this was what
they call residual bleeding,'' said Michaels. ``He actually lost a
lot of blood. But he got a transfusion and is doing fine right
now.''
   Phillips was released from the hospital Monday.

   Seems someone at the Miss America
Pageant still can't come to grips with Vanessa Williams.
   Miss Williams, who was stripped of her 1984 crown after nude
photographs of her were published in Penthouse magazine, is named
on the back page of this year's program, along with all winners
since the first contest in 1921.
   Her reign from Sept. 17, 1983, to July 23, 1984, is listed, as
is runner-up Suzette Charles _ from July 23 to Sept. 15, 1984.
   But in a separate section detailing the accomplishments of the
past 10 winners, the achievements and name of Miss Williams are
absent.
   The singer has met success with such hit songs as ``Dreamin' ''
and ``The Right Stuff.''

   Italian maestro Claudio Abbado has signed a
seven-yaer contract with the Berlin Philharmonic, succeeding the
late Herbert von Karajan.
   Abbado, 57, was picked last October by orchestra members to
succeed von Karajan, who died in July 1989.
   Orchestra spokesman Helge Gruenewald declined to say how much
Abbado will be paid under the contract signed Tuesday, but the
newspaper Der Tagesspiegel said the maestro will receive salary and
benefits totaling $500,000 per year.

   Jerry Lewis will return to Hollywood next
Labor Day with his Muscular Dystrophy Association telethon after
raising a record amount in pledges this year.
   Association officials said the 21{-hour show, which ended
Monday, raised $44.1 million to fight 40 neuromuscular diseases
that kill and cripple thousands each year, most of them young
people. Last year's tally was $42.2 million.
   The telethon regularly breaks its pledge records, but ratings in
recent years have dropped. Viewing figures are to be released in
two or three days.
   Producers moved the 25th annual telethon to Los Angeles after 17
years in Las Vegas to reduce costs and update the show's image.

<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeted
Wednesday because of continuing concern about the Middle East
situation, traders said. The dollar dropped sharply against the
Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 829.30
points, or 3.33 percent, closing at 24,078.34. The index shed
512.79 points on Tuesday.
   The dollar closed at 142.30 yen, down 1.75 yen from Tuesday's
close. After opening at 143.08 yen, the U.S. currency ranged
between 142.17 yen and 143.25 yen.
   In bond dealings, the yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds edged up to 8.150 percent as of 3 p.m. (2
a.m. EDT) from Tuesday's close of 8.130 percent. Their price stood
at 82.87 points, down from 82.96 on Tuesday.
   Securities dealers said the Nikkei index fell because of a lack
of buying incentives due to continuing uncertainty over the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   ``Concern about higher interest rates resulting from price
increases in crude oil is adversely affecting investors,'' said
Yozo Asai, an analyst with Yamaichi Securities.
   In the currency market, dealers said the dollar's lower start
followed a decline in New York, where it fell to 143.40 yen from
143.785 yen late Friday. U.S. financial markets were closed Monday
for Labor Day.
   ``The yen is favored over the dollar and European currencies,''
said Kozo Yoshida, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   Yoshida said life insurance firms were among those selling
dollars.
   The dollar has slumped in recent weeks because of pessimism
about the U.S. economy. Its weakness has been countered, however,
by concern over the Persian Gulf situation. The dollar is usually
viewed as a safe haven in times of crisis.
   Other dealers said the markets are awaiting the release Friday
of the U.S. employment figures for August.
   Meanwhile, North Sea Brent crude oil for November delivery was
quoted at $28.05-.15 a barrel in Tokyo, up from its close at $27.92
in London Tuesday.

<HEAD>Program Unveiled to Slim Iron City</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An effort is under way to get people in the
Iron City to stop eating like steelworkers.
   The state has joined 100 companies and two drug store chains in
sponsoring the Pittsburgh Community Health Challenge, which will
offer some 52,000 workers and other members of the public a 10-week
analysis of their eating habits.
   Organizers hope to turn people away from an artery-clogging
legacy of pirogies, kielbasa, gyros and other high-fat ethnic
dishes that sustained generations of robust steelworkers.
   ``Our parents developed high-fat kinds of foods when they were
working in the steel mills,'' said Donna Donati, the program's
executive director. ``They used to work very hard, burn those
calories off.
   ``But we're eating the same foods they ate when they hung their
clothes outside on the line, rather than what we do, sitting around
as they dry in the dryer.''
   The city, once dependent on steel, has created service,
high-tech and medical jobs since the decline of the mills in the
early 1980s.
   Supporters of the program dined on low-fat quiche and cheesecake
at a Tuesday lunch to unveil the effort aimed at curbing the city's
appetite for foods loaded with saturated fats and cholesterol, both
linked to heart disease.
   Questionnaires about family medical history, smoking, exercise
and diet will be handed out the participating companies, including
PPG Industries Inc., H.J. Heinz Co. and Allegheny Ludlum Corp.,
among the area's largest employers.
   Thrift Drugs and Legend Pharmacies will distribute
questionnaires at their stores.
   A computer analysis will tell respondents how they compare to
average Americans in the risk of heart disease.
   ``It's really personal. It will hit them right on the head,''
Ms. Donati said.
   Pennsylvania had 266.8 heart disease deaths per 100,000 people
in 1986, the most recent year available, said Dr. Lewis Kuller of
the University of Pittsburgh's school of public health. The
national average was 246.8 deaths per 100,000.
   Most southwestern Pennsylvania residents are ignorant of the
dangers of cholesterol and fat, researchers said.
   ``Most of them don't have the foggiest idea what they're doing
to themselves,'' Kuller said. ``It's so simple, too. People can
reduce cholesterol in their food through simple changes and
substitutions.''
   Organizers said doctors don't tell their patients enough about
the importance of diet.
   ``Most doctors are poorly educated in nutrition,'' said Pitt's
Dr. Trevor Orchard. ``They don't have time to spend giving
nutrition counseling, even if they did know what they are talking
about.''
   ``The physicians should be provided with the names of foods that
are low in fat or cholesterol, as the drug companies have been
doing for years,'' said Christian Chavanne, executive chef at
Galaxy Cheese Co.
   The company makes Formagg, a cheese of skim milk and soybean and
canola oils that was featured in pizza, quiche and chicken at
Tuesday's lunch.
   Chavanne said watching fat content ``doesn't mean you can't have
that occasional binge or splurge once in awhile, the T-bone steak
every three weeks if you've been good.''

<TEXT>
   Britain's Middle East empire is long gone, but
London's strong political and defense ties in the region have given
it a high-profile role in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Britain helped draw the current map of the Middle East after
World War I and was deeply involved in governing many countries in
the region _ including both Iraq and Kuwait.
   Last month, it was the first power to send weapons in support of
the U.S. buildup in the region, and last weekend Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher bore the brunt of Iraqi invective over the West's
military challenge to its invasion of Kuwait.
   Mrs. Thatcher accused President Saddam Hussein of Iraq of having
``hidden behind the skirts of women and children,'' and the Iraqi
News Agency denounced her as an ``old hag.''
   ``Thatcher would do well to bear in mind that the empire on
whose possessions the sun did not go down has long been defunct,
and neither she nor any of her allies will be able to set the clock
back,'' it said.
   Dr. Basim Musallam, director of the Center of Mideast Studies at
Cambridge University, says the historical background has made
Britain's role in the Persian Gulf ``bigger than the number of
planes it has sent.''
   Britain sells sophisticated military hardware to the gulf
states, and British officers help train their soldiers and pilots.
   In 1988, Britain signed its biggest arms deal ever, to sell
Saudi Arabia nearly $20 billion worth of warplanes.
   ``Britain was the last imperial power to withdraw from the
gulf,'' Musallam said in an interview. ``The British know the
terrain very well. They have close connections with the local
rulers ... much more than the French or Americans.''
   Originally Britain needed the Middle East to shut out Russia and
Germany and secure its routes to the Orient, and it ruled Arabia
from India until after World War I.
   The seven sheikdoms which now comprise the United Arab Emirates
and Kuwait gave Britain control of foreign affairs and defense in
the late 19th century. Bahrain was a British protectorate from 1861
until 1971.
   A romantic Anglo-Arab tradition developed, personified by such
figures as Lawrence of Arabia.
   Oil changed Britain's interest in the Middle East. The Royal
Navy switched to oil in 1912 just as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company,
which is now British Petroleum, started operations in Persia, now
Iran.
   Having defeated the Ottoman Empire in World War I, Britain and
France drew new Mideast boundaries. France got Lebanon and Syria.
Britain got Iraq, Transjordan (now Jordan), and Palestine.
   Britain installed friendly Arab rulers who were ``more or less
amenable to British protection, a situation which survived more or
less until the late 1930s,'' according to Oxford University
historian Alastair Parker.
   Then came more changes. Oil was struck in Saudi Arabia, and the
Americans moved into the Middle East for the first time. Meanwhile,
the Jews were demanding a state in Palestine.
   Britain was torn, and in 1939 it opted for a pro-Arab policy.
   After World War II, the British Empire began to wane. But
London's interests in the Middle East remained paramount. In 1956,
it joined France in trying to seize the Suez Canal from the
Egyptian nationalist leader Gamal Abdel Nasser. In the early 1960s,
it sent troops to ward off threats in the Persian Gulf and Adan (in
present-day Yemen).
   Prof. John Vincent, a Middle East historian at the University of
Bristol, says Iraq shouldn't be surprised by Britain's response to
the Kuwait invasion. ``We are sticking to precedent,'' he said in
an interview. ``This is what we've always done.''
   ``Our interest has stayed the same down the ages,'' he said.
``We want a balanced, strong, independent Middle East which isn't
under the thumb of any great powers and which isn't under a
regional dictator.''
   Columnist Robert Harris mused in The Sunday Times at the
reversal in U.S. and British roles.
   ``For half a century after World War I, American foreign policy
was dominated by a desire to break up the British empire. That
policy succeeded _ perhaps too well,'' he wrote.
   ``Now, as Washington's gunboats are required to steam along our
old imperial routes to the gulf, one cannot help but smile.''

   Gov. Bob Miller crushed five Democratic
challengers Tuesday in his bid for a full term in the job he
inherited two years ago. Businessman Jim Gallaway won an eight-way
race for the Republican nomination.
   Miller moved up automatically from the lieutenant governor's
post after Gov. Dick Bryan was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1988.
   With one-third of precincts reporting, Miller had 41,294 votes,
or 80 percent; the next most popular choice of voters was ``None of
the Above'' _ which appears on all Nevada ballots _ with 4,100
votes or 9 percent. A long-shot hopeful who changed his name to
Rhinestone Cowboy was running third with 1,540 votes.
   In the GOP race, Gallaway had 23,146 votes, or 49 percent,
``None of the Above'' drew 10,585 votes, or 24 percent, and builder
Charlie Brown had 9,221 votes.
   Gallaway, a relative newcomer to the state, said Miller had
shown ``a total lack of leadership'' as governor. Gallaway was
accused by Brown, of trying to buy the election with slick
television ads. Gallaway outspent Brown by 4-to-1.
   A poll conducted for the Nevada Retailers Association in August
looked at the likely matchup in November and found Miller trouncing
Gallaway 60 percent to 27 percent. The poll's margin of error was 4
percentage points.
   But Gallaway hoped to gain support from two issues. He favors
abortion rights and opposes a statewide payroll tax plan while
Miller is anti-abortion and backs the tax.
   In a bizarre contest, the name of late Assemblyman Marvin
Sedway, a Las Vegas Democrat, was listed on the ballot in the
District 15 Assembly contest. He died in July of lung cancer, too
late to have his name removed. The ballot also included political
unknown Charles Wakefield.
   Sedway's widow, Kim, expressed interest in the job, but too late
to get on the ballot. She hoped Sedway would win the primary and
the county Democratic committee would then pick her as its
candidate. If so, she would face Republican Bob Wong in November.
   A plane crash Monday seriously injured two candidates in the GOP
primary _ Sue Wagner, running for lieutenant governor, and Bob
Seale, who is running for treasurer. Seale's wife, Judy, was killed
in the crash, authorities said. Both held substantial leads.
   Five people were aboard the twin-engine plane that crashed after
takeoff from Fallon for a Labor Day parade in Carson City. Two
aides to the candidates suffered less serious injuries and were
taken to a hospital, authorities said.

<HEAD>Huge Crowd Witnesses Reburial Of Allende</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an outpouring of emotion, tens of
thousands of Chileans lined the streets to view the casket of
toppled Marxist President Salvador Allende, whose remains were
unearthed from a humble grave for an honorable burial.
   Tuesday's solemn ceremony, organized by the new democratic
government, came 17 years after Allende's death in a bloody
military coup.
   The military was conspicuously absent from the ceremonies. Gen.
Augusto Pinochet led the coup against Allende and still heads the
armed forces.
   The day was chosen because it marked 20 years since Allende
became the Western hemisphere's first freely elected Marxist
president.
   As the crowd dispersed after the observances, riot police
blocked small groups who attempted to march to the city center.
   Interior Minister Enrique Kraus said 92 people were detained in
sporadic clashes with police in Santiago and five in Vina del Mar,
but all were released three hours later. Santiago was reported calm
at dusk.
   The official observances were marked by appeals to preserve
Chile's newly restored democratic rule.
   ``We express our will to favor the future of our country, which
demands from us to unite beyond the disputes that separated us in
the past,'' President Patricio Aylwin said in a speech at the
cemetery.
   Allende's remains, which had been buried outside the capital,
were placed in a marble mausoleum at Santiago's main cemetery,
where other Chilean presidents and dignitaries are buried.
   Aylwin, an elected civilian who was a political foe of Allende,
succeeded Pinochet in March, putting an end to 16{ years of
authoritarian military rule.
   Allende died during an attack on his presidential palace on
Sept. 11, 1973. The military said he committed suicide rather than
surrender.
   Allende's remains were unearthed early in the day from a modest
family tomb in Vina del Mar. In Santiago, thousands of people lined
the streets to view the flag-draped coffin.
   The procession drove the presidential palace, the Catholic
Cathedral and finally the capital's main cemetery.
   Right-wing politicians said the ceremony was a bid to gain
political advantage for the government and the left.
   But the government said the reburial was ``repairing an
unjustice toward a man who was a legitimate president of Chile.''
   Aylwin was booed when he recalled in his speech that he had
opposed the Allende government.
   Raising his voice, the 71-year-old president replied: ``To those
who are booing, I say: The only language that will allow us to
understand each to other is the language of truth.''
   ``The horror and suffering that Chile has gone through should
never happen again,'' he continued. ``It's a task for all Chileans
to prevent it, and we will be able to do so only if we reject
hatred and violence.''
   Allende's widow, Hortensia Bussi, said Tuesday's ceremonies
``should be seen as a contribution to reconciliation.''
   French Prime Minister Michel Rocard, speaking on behalf of
foreign dignitaries attending the ceremony, stressed the importance
of preserving democracy.
   He said restoration of democracy in Chile ``shows that freedom
can be momentarily supressed, but it can never be defeated.''
   Security around the ceremonies was tight.
   Four bombs went off overnight in Santiago, causing minor damage
to two military monuments and two shops but no injuries. A
right-wing group claimed responsibility.

   A powerful former legislator who once
proclaimed he had ``never taken a dime with strings attached'' has
pleaded guilty after being captured on videotape taking a wad of
$100 bills to help pass a gambling bill.
   Former state Rep. Robert Brown on Tuesday became the first of
five lawmakers indicted in an FBI vote-selling sting to plead
guilty. The seven-year lawmaker, a Democrat from Marion, was the
most powerful of those charged.
   Other indicted lawmakers also will be shown on FBI videotape,
said U.S. Attorney Bart Daniel.
   Brown, 34, former chairman of the Labor, Commerce and Industry
Committee, admitted taking $2,500 from a lobbyist working to
legalize horse and dog racing. The bill was approved by Brown's
committee last year but never came up for a full House vote.
   Brown, who agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, could get up to
20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine on one count of corruption.
No sentencing date was set.
   Prosecutors played a grainy black-and-white videotape of Brown
accepting $2,000 in cash from the lobbyist, Ron Cobb, aboard a FBI
yacht on April 14.
   FBI agent Michael Clemens testified Brown also accepted $500
from Cobb in a hotel room in May. Cobb, a former state House
member, had turned undercover agent.
   Shortly after news of the investigation broke in July, Brown
denied accepting money in exchange for his services or his vote. He
resigned his seat Aug. 23, one day before he was indicted.
   Another indicted legislator, Rick Lee, is scheduled to appear
before a federal judge on Monday. Lee, a Republican, resigned his
Senate seat a week ago and has said he intends to plead guilty to
accepting a $2,000 bribe.
   Reps. Robert Kohn, Luther Taylor and Danny Winstead also were
indicted under the Hobbs Act, a federal law banning acceptance of
money or gifts for votes or favors. Winstead also was indicted on
an obstruction charge.
   Kohn, a Republican who has said he will not seek re-election,
and Taylor, a Democrat, have been suspended from the House.
Winstead, a Republican, resigned Aug. 23.

<HEAD>N.Y. Post Losing Money; Sets Sept. 15 Deadline for Union
Concessions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Post is losing $25 million a year
and could close unless its unions agree to cost-cutting measures,
union and management representatives say.
   Post general manager Richard T. Nasti said after a meeting with
leaders of the paper's 10 unions Tuesday that the paper has set
Sept. 15 as a deadline for reaching agreement. He added that he is
optimistic the deadline will be met.
   Nasti said there is ``a $25 million annual gap that must be
filled to allow (Publisher) Peter Kalikow to continue publishing
the paper.'' But, in a statement, he did not say what would happen
if the deadline were not met.
   Theodore Kheel, a labor mediator and adviser to the unions'
Allied Printing Trades Council who was at the meeting, said it was
his understanding that ``if they are not able to reach agreement
with the unions on savings of some $17 million, they would suspend
publication and give employees a 60-day notice.''
   Kheel said workers would be paid during the 60 days, but the
paper could cease publication immediately on Sept. 15.
   He said $17 million is the amount the Post hopes to save through
cost-cutting measures affecting its unions, with the rest to be
made up in other ways.
   The Allied is an umbrella group for the 10 unions representing
900 employees at the Post, which is the nation's oldest daily. The
tabloid, founded in 1801, has a circulation of 505,000, behind the
Daily News and The New York Times.
   The Post offered to open its books to its unions, and meetings
were scheduled for today and Thursday to discuss cost-cutting
proposals.
   Kalikow bought the Post from Rupert Murdoch in 1988 when the
paper was losing about $3 million a month. Concessions from the
unions were part of the package that Murdoch had to achieve to meet
Kalikow's terms.
   The unions also are involved in negotiations with the Daily News
over cost-saving measures the newspaper says are crucial to its
survival.

<HEAD>Federal Investigators Criticize Blood-Heating Treatment for AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal scientists have concluded a controversial
blood-heating treatment for AIDS did nothing to help two U.S.
patients.
   The team of researchers from the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases also said the hyperthermia treatment, a
technique to raise body temperature and kill the AIDS virus, should
not be repeated.
   Dr. Kenneth Alonso, who helped pioneer the technique, charged
that the report was ``replete with errors'' and merely an attempt
to discredit his work.
   ``Apparently any work which does not fit your thesis is
ignored,'' Alonso said in a letter to Dr. Lawrence Deyton, NIAID
assistant director for community and head of the investigative
team. The letter was released on Tuesday.
   A summary of the investigative team's findings released Tuesday
by the NIAID said, ``Hyperthermia, as applied in these cases,
appears to have offered no clinical, immunologic or virologic
benefits to these two patients.''
   NIAID reported that the two patients still were infected by the
AIDS virus.
   There does not ``appear any support for further human
experimentation in this area at this time,'' the summary concluded.
   The institute's report is the harshest official criticism yet of
the treatment, which offered hope to thousands of AIDS sufferers
earlier this year after one patient pronounced himself cured.
   NIAID researchers visited Alonso at his request July 25 to learn
about his technique, which had been performed in the United States
on two patients infected with the virus. A third man, reportedly a
very ill AIDS patient from New York, received the treatment from
Alonso in Mexico and died hours later.
   The first patient, 33-year-old Carl Crawford, reported dramatic
improvements in his Kaposi's sarcoma, a skin cancer afflicting many
AIDS patients. He went so far as to tell reporters he had been
``cured of AIDS.''
   But tests showed no evidence the man had Kaposi's sarcoma, the
NIAID reported. The researchers suggested Crawford's skin problems
resulted from an infection from cat scratches that was cleared up
by antibiotics.
   Alonso called that conclusion ``absurd.''
   The second patient, a 38-year-old with advanced AIDS whose
identity was kept confidential, reported little or no improvement
after hyperthermia, according to the NIAID report. Alonso disputed
those findings as well.
   Hyperthermia, commonly used to treat infections before the
advent of antibiotics, is still used against some cancers.
   In the procedure developed by Alonso and his former partner, Dr.
William Logan, the patient's blood was run through a heater and
back into the body to raise body temperature.
   The NIAID report, however, noted that some researchers have
reported that heat can actually increase the AIDS virus.

   The U.S. Marines call their patch of the
Saudi Arabian desert ``the twilight zone.''
   The sector south of the border with occupied Kuwait is home to
venomous scorpions, snakes like carpet vipers and heat that's
almost unbearable. The men never know the exact temperature, and
perhaps that's a blessing.
   ``We don't know what day, what month, what time it is,'' said
Lance Cpl. Eddie Zazueta, 21, of Los Angeles. ``I think maybe I was
supposed to get out last year. This is the Twilight Zone.''
   Under a pounding sun, Zazueta and his fellow Marines patrol the
Martian landscape in their ``heavy gun'' _ a transport vehicle with
a 50-caliber machine gun on the roof _ just across from a region
that's been bristling with Iraqi troops since the Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait.
   The man on gun watch wakes the others up around 5 a.m.
   ``You usually just smack them in the legs,'' said Sgt. Thomas
Hixson, 23, of Kingston, Tenn., the section leader for two vehicles
in the platoon. Riding with him are Zazueta and Lance Cpl. John
Doyle, 24, of Tulsa, Okla.
   Alert for any attack, Hixson sets reveille an hour before the
time ordered for the whole 2nd Battalion of the 7th Marine
Expeditionary Brigade.
   Some men have suffered nasty scorpion stings early in the
morning as they groped for their toilet kits. A day in the clinic
and they are back on the line.
   The morning ``bath'' is perfunctory but important; a nearby army
unit that skipped it came down with body lice and dysentery, Hixson
said.
   Hot showers back at the base come about every 10 days.
   Breakfast is a banana, apple, orange or an MRE _
``meal-ready-to-eat.'' Frankfurters are the favorite.
   By 6 a.m., they've picked up their four gallons of water and are
headed for the day's practice battle positions and maneuvers until
noon.
   At 7 a.m. it's 85 degrees. An hour later, it's 97. By noon it's
approaching 120 degrees and the heavy guns crawl under camouflage
tents until 5 p.m.
   Sleep at midday is impossible because of the heat.
   ``We talk about John Wayne-kinda stuff. What to do if we're
attacked,'' said Hixson.
   ``We pray for war,'' said Zazueta.
   They banter about getting rid of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   ``We just want to go kick him, get him out and get home,'' said
Hixson.
   Mail is important.
   ``If we have somebody who doesn't get mail, you can tell.
They're down, not motivated, don't talk,'' said Hixson.
   ``I just got divorced, but I wish my ex would write me. I gotta
get a girlfriend.''
   While he talked the others whooped over a package he received
from his sister, Pam Semezian in Jacksonville, Fla.
   It included gum, starbursts, Ritz crackers, peanut butter,
watermelon flavored Jolly Ranchers and pre-addressed envelopes.
   Time not spent pouring over letters is spent writing them.
   Week-old newspapers are devoured, and a major complaint is the
lack of world news. Few men brought shortwave radios.
   When the temperature slides downwards in late afternoon, the
heavy gun trio sometimes get up a football game.
   After 5 p.m. its time for more maneuvers, and then a stop for
dinner sometime after the eagerly awaited sunset.
   It's MREs again _ heavy sealed plastic bags with the menu
stamped in black letters on the outside.
   Hot meals are as rare as showers. The last one came with green
eggs.
   ``If you want a hot meal you just have to put it on a rock and
flip it over every 3 seconds,'' said 1st Lt. Ron Ainslie, the
platoon commander.
   ``It gets pretty hot,'' said Ainslie, a 28-year-old from
Haslett, Mich.
   Leaving them in the sun too long can cause problems, though.
About 20 men came down with food poisoning.
   Darkness usually brings the few things the men enjoy: a breeze
and the stars.
   ``But I wish we had a nightclub out here,'' said Hixson.
   The night includes one hour of guard duty after every three of
sleep.
   Battalion Commander Col. Carl Fulford says he'd like to see
everybody home by the Marine Corps' birthday, Nov. 10.
   Many think it will take longer before the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait is rolled back.
   ``I don't expect to be home for Christmas,'' said Hixson.

<HEAD>Six Students Killed in Protests Against Job Quotas; Bus Service
Halted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police fatally shot six students
protesting plans to give more jobs to low-caste Hindus, and growing
violence prompted the government today to cancel bus service
linking New Delhi with state capitals.
   The buses were canceled to avoid clashes and attacks on
state-owned buses during a 50-hour strike beginning Thursday that
students have called.
   They are protesting Prime Minister V.P. Singh's proposal to
reserve half of all government jobs for lower castes.
   Thousands of passengers were stranded at New Delhi's Inter State
Bus Terminus today. At least 25,000 people a day normally travel on
buses from the station, the largest in India.
   Said a transport official at the bus terminal: ``We are running
only those limited services which can return to the depot by this
evening.''
   Police in Bihar, India's poorest state, opened fire on students
Tuesday, killing at least six people and wounding 50, news reports
said. The violence raises to 14 the number of people killed in four
weeks of street protests against Singh's decision.
   The Statesman newspaper said students had set numerous cars on
fire and attempted to storm the government secretariat in Patna,
the capital of the eastern state of Bihar.
   Indian Express, a New Delhi-based newspaper, said groups of
students planned to block all traffic on the streets of the capital
when the strike begins Thursday.
   An organization of upper-caste farmers that commands wide
support in areas around New Delhi has pledged support and said its
members will block all roads leading to the city.
   Prime Minister Singh announced Aug. 7 that 49 percent of
government jobs would be reserved on the basis of caste, up from a
previous 22 percent. In addition, 5 to 10 percent of jobs would be
reserved for poor people regardless of caste and the rest would be
awarded on merit, he said.
   The proposal raised a storm of protest. The government employs
18 million people and a white-collar job is much-sought by
graduating students.
   Opponents said Singh was attempting to buy votes from the lower
castes, who form a majority of India's 880 million people.
   The chief opposition party, the Congress Party of previous Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi, has dismissed the proposals as politically
motivated.
   Media criticism has also been fierce. The biweekly India Today
magazine said Tuesday that the decision marked ``the descent of
Singh from leader to demagogue.
   ``He has been reduced ... to a vote-hungry power broker
shamelessly using the two elements which have ever bloodied and
divided this nation _ religion and caste,'' the news magazine said.
   Hindus, who make up 82 percent of the country's people, are
divided into four main castes and hundreds of sub-castes.
Discrimination on the basis of caste is legally banned, but in
reality the system permeates much of Indian life, especially in
rural areas.

   A leading suspect in the stabbing
deaths of five college students is wanted on charges he followed a
woman, put a knife to her throat and tore her blouse two years ago,
authorities said.
   Investigators on Tuesday also revisited the off-campus sites of
last month's killings with a laser device to search for evidence.
   As most students returned from the Labor Day weekend, police
again warned that the killer may still be in their midst.
   A memorial service for the slain students _ four from the
University of Florida and a fifth from Santa Fe Community College _
was scheduled for today at the university. Scholarships in their
memories were to be announced.
   The Indian River County Sheriff's Office filed armed burglary
and attempted sexual battery charges Tuesday against Edward Lewis
Humphrey after a 27-year-old woman identified him from his
newspaper picture as the man who attacked her.
   Humphrey is in jail on $1 million on charges of beating up his
grandmother. Police said he lived briefly this summer at an
apartment complex and a dormitory where three of the slaying
victims lived and is one of eight suspects.
   According to the police report on the 1988 incident in Indian
County, the woman said a man followed her into her home near Vero
Beach, tore her blouse and held a hunting knife to her throat. She
said she got away and called police.
   ``Similarities from the 1988 incident, compiled with the
knowledge that Humphrey was being looked at by the task force in
Gainesville, prompted the sheriff's office to notify authorities in
Gainesville,'' the sheriff's office said. Sheriff's spokeswoman
Theresa Woodson did not specify the similarities.
   Police in Gainesville said the serial killer stalks trim
brunettes, slipping into their off-campus apartments through
windows or doors. He killed four women and a man in three attacks,
mutilating three of the victims.
   Prosecutors said would fight an effort to lower Humphrey's bail.
   ``I'm not saying he's the killer, but the fact is that some
things have surfaced in that investigation that convince us he is a
serious danger to the community,'' said Michael Hunt, assistant
state attorney.
   Investigators have taken Humphrey's fingerprints and footprints,
samples of his blood and his psychiatric records.
   His Gainesville apartment remained sealed as a search continued
on the grounds around it. Police have not sought a a search warrant
for the apartment.
   Police confirmed that Stephen Michael Bates, a Lakeland
short-order cook, was another suspect. He has been held on $100,500
bail since his Aug. 29 arrest in an unrelated assault case. Polk
County authorities said they doubt Bates, 30, is the killer, but
his fingerprints have been sent to the task force.
   Also Tuesday, Michael West, a forensic specialist from
Hattiesburg, Miss., arrived with a sophisticated laser device to be
used in the investigation. West, whose specialty is matching bite
marks to teeth, is a dentist and a deputy coroner. Investigators
did not say what they hope the laser will help them find.

   A Panamanian-registered cargo vessel left
the Kuwaiti port of Shuwaikh today with more than 600 Indian
refugees aboard, shipping sources said.
   The merchant ship, Safeer, is the first to sail out of Kuwait
with refugees since Iraq invaded the oil-rich desert kingdom on
Aug. 2.
   The 9,300-ton Safeer was expected to reach the southern Persian
Gulf port of Dubai on Thursday, said the sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The voyage from Kuwait to Dubai should take about 30 hours. From
Dubai, the evacuees will be flown to India, diplomatic sources said
on condition they not be identified.
   Shipping sources said the Safeer was in Kuwait at the time of
the invasion, after arriving from the port of Kantala in western
India.
   There are an estimated 150,000 Indians still trapped in Kuwait
awaiting evacuation, diplomats said.
   Two Indian-registered ships, the Akbar and the Tipu Sultan, are
expected to begin evacuation from Kuwait by Monday. The Tibu Sultan
can accommodate about 600 passengers. The Akbar can take about
1,500, the sources said.

   Irene Dunne, the alluring star of Hollywood
tear-jerkers, musicals and screwball comedies in the 1930s and '40s
such as ``Showboat'' and ``I Remember Mama,'' has died. She was 88.
   Miss Dunne, who died of heart failure at her home Tuesday, was
among the most sought after and highest paid stars during her
Hollywood heyday, appearing opposite such leading men as William
Powell, Cary Grant and Charles Boyer.
   She used her fine comic timing in such comedies as ``The Awful
Truth'' and ``My Favorite Wife.'' She sang in such musicals as
``Roberta'' and ``Show Boat'' and acted in the tear-jerkers
``Magnificent Obsession'' and ``Back Street.''
   Miss Dunne was nominated for Oscars five times, for
``Cimarron,'' 1930, ``Theodora Goes Wild,'' 1936, ``The Awful
Truth,'' 1937, ``Love Affair,'' 1939, and ``I Remember Mama,'' 1948.
   ``I Remember Mama,'' in which Miss Dune played the mother of a
Swedish immigrant family in San Francisco, was her favorite. She
generally favored her more dramatic roles.
   ``Comedy was easy for me but it wasn't rewarding in the same
way,'' she said in a 1985 interview. ``But Cary (Grant) paid me one
of the loveliest compliments of my life. He said I had the best
timing of anyone he ever worked with.
   ``It must be something that comes naturally to you. My father
had a keen sense of humor, which I think is different from having a
sense of humor.''
   Ginger Rogers, who appeared in ``Roberta'' with Miss Dunne,
described her as ``a fine and loving lady,'' but one who was
difficult to get to know well.
   ``She had a very excellent singing voice,'' Miss Rogers said.
   Irene Marie Dunn _ she added the ``e'' later _ was raised in
Louisville, Ky. She trained her lyrical soprano voice at the
Chicago College of Music, intending an operatic career.
   But when she failed an audition at the Metropolitan Opera House
in 1920, she turned to musical comedy.
   The actress was appearing in ``Show Boat'' when she was signed
to a contract by RKO Pictures in 1929. Except for ``Cimarron'' and
``Roberta,'' in which she sang ``Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,'' her RKO
films were undistinguished.
   Only when she became a free-lance star in 1936 did her career
soar.
   Her other films included: ``Joy of Living,'' 1938, ``Penny
Serenade,'' 1941, ``A Guy Named Joe,'' 1943, ``The White Cliffs of
Dover,'' 1944, ``Over 21,'' 1941, ``Anna and the King of Siam,''
1946, ``Life with Father,'' 1947, ``The Mudlark,'' 1950.
   Her last film was a mild comedy, ``It Grows on Trees,'' in 1952.
She made occasional TV appearances afterward.
   She was too ill to attend in 1985 when she was scheduled to
accept Kennedy Center Honors in Washington along with Bob Hope,
Allan J. Lerner and Frederick Loewe, Beverly Sills and Merce
Cunningham.
   Miss Dunne was active in Roman Catholic causes and also worked
for the Republican party. President Eisenhower appointed her an
alternate delegate to the U.N. 12th General Assembly. Ronald and
Nancy Reagan were close friends.
   Miss Dunne married a dentist, Francis Griffin, in 1920, and
remarked after his death in 1965, ``I had the most marvelous
husband and it was a great surprise to me to learn that he had kept
every letter I had written to him.''
   Along with her daughter, Mary Frances Griffin Gage, she is
survived by two grandchildren and a niece.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<HEAD>Satellite Group Sues Over Failed Launch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Intelsat, the international satellite consortium,
is suing Titan rocket builder Martin Marietta Corp. for $400
million over the botched launch of a $145 million communications
satellite now stuck in a useless orbit.
   In the lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court in Baltimore,
Intelsat charged that Martin Marietta miswired the rocket, then
gave false assurances of its quality before the March 14 launch,
for which Intelsat paid $115 million.
   Martin Marietta has said a wiring problem caused failure of the
satellite and its attached booster rocket to separate from the
Titan when they reached orbit.
   As a result, the uninsured satellite fell short of its station
22,300 miles above Earth and will be a total loss unless it gets a
boost. A shuttle crew will try to rescue it next year at a cost to
Intelsat of about $90 million.
   Intelsat claimed Martin Marietta didn't take proper steps to
detect the flaw and failed to properly analyze test data or
supervise crews that built the rocket.
   Elliott Miller, Martin Marietta director of corporate relations,
said the lawsuit had no merit and that Intelsat had declined to buy
insurance.
   ``Under the launch services contract between Martin Marietta and
Intelsat, the relationship of the parties for risk of loss is
clearly set forth,'' he said. ``The contract provides that Martin
Marietta is not liable for the satellite failure to achieve orbit.''
   Martin Marietta, based in Bethesda, Md., built the rocket near
Denver.
   The aerospace company attempted a pre-emptive strike against
Intelsat in July, asking the federal court to declare that its only
legal responsibility was to provide a replacement launch. Martin
Marietta said it might have to go out of the commercial launch
business if it were made to pay damages.
   But in its lawsuit, Intelsat noted that Martin Marietta was
considering dropping out anyway.

<DATELINE>RUWEISHID CAMP, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of ragged Asian refugees
who fled Iraq and Kuwait are battling for starvation rations in
this squalid desert camp. The United Nations is desperately
appealing for international help.
   Thousands pushed and scuffled among themselves Tuesday next to a
large trailer truck from which Jordanian officials were trying to
distribute food _ a round piece of flat Arab bread, one tomato and
one small cucumber per person.
   The commotion and the disorder was so great that the dozen or so
Jordanian soldiers on duty stripped off their belts and started
flailing the ragged refugees, yelling at them to stop fighting and
get into line.
   But again and again, as soon as some order was restored, the
thousands at the back surged forward, screaming for their share of
the meager rations before they ran out.
   There were slightly less chaotic scenes at scattered points in
the vast desert camp when half a dozen tanker trucks arrived to
distribute water.
   ``We are fighting because we are hungry and thirsty. ... Tell
the world we are going to die here if we are not helped,'' Ahmed
Saed, a white-bearded Pakistani, pleaded with reporters visiting
the camp near the Iraqi border.
   ``It is not easy to control people who are hungry and thirsty,''
said Suleyman Bakr, one of five Jordanian doctors manning a first
aid tent.
   ``We need more food, more water, and better organization. But
what's needed more than anything is to get these people to their
countries as soon as possible,'' he said.
   The makeshift camp at Ruweishid is regarded as the most
desperate area in Jordan for evacuees who have arrived from Kuwait
and Iraq in the month since Iraqi troops overran the oil-rich
emirate.
   It is located at Shaalan, 50 miles inside Jordan, between the
Ruweishid border post and the Iraqi border. It houses 40,000 mostly
penniless refugees from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the
Philippines and Thailand.
   Many have been stranded for the past two weeks awaiting travel
arrangements for the journey on to their homelands.
   Philippine Airlines announced today that it has scheduled 21
flights this month to the Jordanian capital of Amman to speed up
the evacuation of stranded Filipinos.
   R.K. Jenny, a senior U.N. official trying to organize a massive
airlift for the Asians, announced Tuesday that the United Nations
has launched a world appeal to help Jordan cope with the massive
influx.
   ``This is going to be a gigantic problem calling for a gigantic
response,'' he told a news conference in the capital, Amman.
   Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan said more than 100,000 Asians are
stranded in his country _ out of the 420,000 people who have
crossed into Jordan from Iraq and Kuwait since Aug. 7.
   ``The situation may soon become critical,'' he told the news
conference. ``The plight of these persons has only evoked the
faintest of responses from the world community and from a world
press more interested in war scenarios than humanitarian relief.''
   Indeed, there has been concern that world attention has been
focused instead on the better-off Westerners being held by the
Iraqis, and their quest to get out.
   In Amman later Tuesday, Jordan's American-born Queen Noor
embraced and kissed British millionaire Richard Branson when he
flew in aboard a 747 jumbo jet of his Virgin Atlantic airline with
30 tons of food for the stranded Asians.
   ``We are so grateful. We desperately need all this,'' the queen
told Branson as she pointed at the sacks of wheat slung on top of
the scarlet first class seats of the jet.
   ``We will get this to the really desperate areas and this action
you have done is a tremendous help,'' the queen added.
   Branson said he was worried more about the plight of the
stranded Asian and Arab refugees than of the Westerners trying to
leave areas under Iraqi control.
   ``What we are doing is only a pittance,'' he said. ``Children
and old people are dying. We need a massive airlift, and ships.
This is something the United Nations should do.''
   One Bangladeshi in Ruweishid said his embassy in Kuwait
``advised us to leave after the Iraqi invasion to avoid being
killed if war broke out with America.
   ``But it would have been better to stay in Iraq and face death
there, rather than die in this terrible stink hole in the desert.''

<HEAD>Kohl To Name Four Top East Germans To His Cabinet, Sources Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl plans to name
four leading East Germans to his Cabinet to help deal with the
massive problems of their people when the two Germanys merge next
month, government sources said today.
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere is a top candidate
for a Cabinet post, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   In East Berlin today, officials said the number of East Germans
either unemployed or working shorter hours at lower pay jumped to
nearly 2 million of the 8.8 million workers last month.
   The Central Labor Office said 361,286 East Germans were without
jobs last month, up by 86,269 from the end of July. The jobless
rate went from 3.1 percent to 4.1 percent.
   That compares with a 1.6 percent rate at the end of June, just
before East Germany converted to a free market economy on July 1
after four decades of socialism.
   Many factories and businesses, no longer subsidized, are having
difficulty competing with more efficient Western enterprises that
now have access to the East German market. Electronics, textiles,
automotive and agricultural industries are among the hardest hit.
   The number of workers who came under a West German-financed
program fighting the rise in unemployment was up to 1,439,412, more
than double the 656,277 in July.
   The workers under this program would have been laid off but are
being kept on payrolls at shorter hours and lower pay subsidized by
West Germany.
   Critics say these workers, some of whom are making only a small
amount over the unemployment rate and not actually doing any work,
should be counted among the jobless.
   Government sources in Bonn said today that as part of Kohl's
plans for an interim government for a united Germany the chancellor
will be adding four East German officials to his Cabinet.
   East Germany and its government will cease to exist on Oct. 3,
the chosen day of unity.
   The four new ministers will help Kohl govern what is now East
Germany between the day of unity and Dec. 2, when an all-German
Parliament will be elected, said the sources.
   They said that along with de Maiziere, other top candidates are
Guenther Krause, de Maiziere's leading unity negotiatior; Sabine
Bergmann-Pohl, president of the East German Parliament; and Rainer
Ortleb, head of the East German Free Democrats.
   The four new Cabinet members would be ministers without
portfolios, said the sources.
   West German radio said the four new ministers would act as
intermediaries between Kohl's government and East Germany's five
soon-to-be-recreated states.
   East Germany will also have parliamentary representation in the
interim period between unity and all-German elections.
   The two Germanys have agreed 144 East German lawmakers will have
seats in the West German Parliament after unity.
   The major East German parties are choosing the 144 on the basis
of the current balance of power within the East German Parliament,
which will be dissolved when unity comes.

   Japan loaded a ship with 800 four-wheel-drive
vehicles for the U.S.-led multinational force in the Persian Gulf,
but a seamen's union held up today's planned departure because of
the war danger.
   The $11 million in cargo, Japan's first installment of the $1
billion it has promised in aid for the effort against Iraq, also
included an unspecified number of water trucks and air conditioners.
   Negotiations between the government and the All Japan Seamen's
Association continued into the evening and it was unclear when the
ship would set sail from the central port of Nagoya. The union said
its members should not be forced to sail into the tense gulf region.
   The Panama-registered Sea Venus, owned by Kawasaki Kisen Co.
Ltd., would take about three weeks to get to the gulf region, the
ship's agent said in a telephone interview.
   The vehicles are expected to be used by military staff in the
multinational forces assembled in Saudi Arabia, said a Foreign
Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The shipment is part of the assistance package announced last
week by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. It is to include 100 medical
personnel and chartered civil aircraft and ships that will
transport food, water and medical supplies ship as well as other
non-military goods.
   Kaifu has ruled out a direct role for Japan's military, citing
the constitutional prohibition against the use of force in settling
international disputes.
   The Foreign Ministry official declined to say when further
shipments were to be made, but Japan has said prefabricated
housing, refrigerators and power generators would likely be sent.
   Kuwait today joined Washington in urging Japan to make a greater
contribution.
   ``I would have wished Japan to have done more,'' Sheikh Ali al
Khalifa al Athbi al-Sabah, finance minister of the Kuwaiti
government in exile, told reporters in Tokyo.
   But he added that persuading Japan to contribute more should be
done ``very softly, considering their circumstances.''
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is to stop briefly in
Tokyo on Friday to explain to Kaifu and other Japanese officials
what kind of further assistance Washington is seeking.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe on Tuesday dismissed
criticism that the aid package did not go far enough, saying it was
a ``rather sizable amount.''
   He also said Japanese corporations will be asked to divert
existing stock to the assistance package and sell their products to
the government at cost.
   Toyota spokesman Yoshiharu Tateishi would not say what losses
the company might incur, but said providing vehicles for the
Persian Gulf force would delay supplies.
   ``Our productivity is not capable to cover the losses because
the domestic demand is already quite high,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II ended his five-day
pilgrimage to Tanzania today by celebrating Mass at the foot of
Mount Kilimanjaro and imploring rich countries to forge ``a new era
of solidarity'' with Africa.
   ``Let the world not forget the urgent needs of the peoples of
Africa,'' the pope said before flying to the central African
country of Burundi, the second leg of his 10-day, four-nation tour.
   John Paul, making his seventh trip to Africa, said he was
pleased with the growth of the Roman Catholic Church in Tanzania,
but he could not ignore that millions of Africans continue to live
in poverty.
   ``I implore God's gifts of comfort, strength and peace upon
those who suffer or are in need on this continent,'' he said in a
departure speech. ``In the name of our common humanity I appeal to
the more developed nations of the earth to inaugurate a new era of
solidarity with Africa, based on justice and respect.''
   Earlier today, about 40,000 people attended the pope's Mass in
Kilimanjaro Stadium, a former cricket and polo grounds of British
rulers.
   When John Paul arrived, the 19,300-foot snowy peak of Africa's
tallest mountain broke through clouds that obscured it much of the
morning.
   In his homily, the pontiff paid tribute to the missionaries who
brought Christianity to northern Tanzania 100 years ago.
   ``The many saints and martyrs of the young African churches show
that what has been handed on since apostolic times need not be
watered down in order to penetrate the rich soil of Africa,'' he
said. ``The heroic response to the demands of conversion and the
challenge of martyrdom constitutes a glorious page in the history
of your particular churches.''
   The pope encouraged his flock to practice their faith in ``an
authentically African way'' by incorporating their customs, culture
and traditions in the church.
   ``By illuminating and purifying these elements of local life
with the Gospel and bringing them into Catholic unity, the whole
church is marvelously enriched,'' he said.
   The pope has urged Roman Catholics to shun such practices as
witchcraft and polygamy, stressing that the basic tenets of the
faith cannot be compromised.
   Among the gifts for the pope was a stuffed lion brought to the
edge of the altar on the back of a pickup truck by a Masai Moran,
or warrior, dressed in the tribe's traditional toga-like robe of
red and blue.
   To mark the pope's visit, members of the Mount Kilimanjaro
Mountain Club scaled the peak and placed a plaque at the summit.
   ``We pray that this visit will sow the seeds of peace, love,
progress and understanding among the people of Tanzania, Africa and
the whole world,'' the plaque read.
   The pope will also travel to Rwanda and the Ivory Coast, where
he will end his tour next week by consecrating the massive basilica
of Our Lady of Peace.

and was unharmed, military officials said.
   The pilot of the Mirage F-1 radioed that a fire had broken out
on board before he ejected and the plane crashed into the
Mediterranean Sea off the southern coast of Corsica, a French
island about 590 miles southeast of Paris, the officials said.
   The plane was taking part in a firing exercise, the officials

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rival Koreas today held their
highest level meeting to date, and North Korea demanded that South
Korea immediately release jailed dissidents and halt a joint
military exercise with the United States.
   For its part, South Korea proposed mutual recognition, free
travel and gradual arms reduction. The Communist north and
capitalist south never formally recognized each other after the
division of Korea in 1945.
   Across town, about 1,000 radical students yelling ``U.S. troops
get out!'' hurled rocks and firebombs at riot police who blocked
them from marching off the campus at Seoul National University and
fired tear gas to disperse them.
   Several people were injured and at least five students were
arrested.
   South Korean Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon, the first to speak
at the opening session, had no opportunity to respond directly to
the demands of the Communist north. But the Seoul government has
already said that the issues are internal matters.
   The north also demanded that South Korea cease efforts to seek a
seat in the United Nations, saying that would perpetuate the
division of the peninsula.
   After each side made its statement, the formal meeting was
adjourned, as scheduled. A second meeting was to be held Thursday
behind closed doors.
   It was unclear whether the future of the talks would be
jeopardized by the north's demands, but North Korean Prime Minister
Yon Hyong Muk strongly indicated that progress in other areas would
be unlikely unless the demands were met. He stopped short of
calling them conditions.
   ``We view these as very urgent, very serious matters ...
directly connected with the future fate of this conference,'' the
North Korean premier said.
   The south opened the talks with a proposal based on its
conviction that mutual confidence-building measures must precede
unification talks.
   North Korea has taken the view that confidence between the two
sides will come only after arms cuts and unification are complete.
   ``Should the authorities of both sides persist in
confrontational and hostile attitudes, inter-Korean relations will
never be improved,'' Kang said.
   The South Korean prime minister said cooperation between the two
sides should include free travel across the border during major
holidays, economic and trade cooperation, and the reconnection of
railroad, highway, mail and telephone service lines.
   Kang also proposed that the two governments work jointly to
locate family members separated by the three-year Korean War in the
early 1950s. An estimated 10 million Koreans were separated from
family members during the conflict.
   On arms reduction, Kang said the two sides should agree to equal
numbers of troops and weapons. Currently, the north has about 1.1
million troops and the South has 650,000 and the support of 43,000
U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.
   Kang said international safeguards for peace on the peninsula
should involve not only the two Koreas, but interested foreign
powers, including the Soviet Union, China, Japan and the United
States.
   South Korean observers have been careful to point out that the
talks that began today are meant to be a significant first step in
a long process of dialogue which eventually may lead to unification.
   A peace treaty was never signed after the Korean War.
   The North Korean delegation is only the third to visit the south
in more than 40 years. The 90-member delegation crossed the border
Tuesday for a four-day visit.
   The talks opened promptly this morning with the seven-member
official delegations of both sides facing one another across a
rectangular table.
   The North Korean premier, wearing a badge depicting North Korean
Communist Party leader Kim Il Sung, waved briefly to onlookers and
took his seat at the north side of the table. The South Korean
premier sat on the south side.
   The premiers smiled broadly and shook hands across the table.
When photographers yelled for them to repeat the action, they stood
for about a minute clasping hands.
   The North Korean delegation was staying at a luxury hotel where
they could tune into American television, enjoy a sauna in a posh
health club and buy German and French magazines.
   The South Korean government was picking up the tab.

   Students watched videotaped lessons that a
teacher's union official called ``high-tech scabbing'' during a
strike that lasted only one day before negotiators reached a
tentative settlement early today.
   Teachers were expected to vote this morning on the settlement
offer, which was made about 2:30 a.m. after nearly 6{ hours of
talks, said Melanie Mitchell, president of the Yakima Education
Association. Ratification was expected to be a formality.
   Details of the offer were not immediately available. But
Mitchell said it gives teachers more say over the method of
classroom instruction, sets limits on class size and addresses
teacher evaluation concerns.
   ``I think we've achieved a settlement both parties can be
pleased with,'' she said.
   School administrators defended their use of television
instruction in the 12,000-pupil district, but some teachers and
students weren't impressed.
   ``It's a joke,'' said sophomore John Williams, who walked out of
an English class Tuesday at Davis High School to find a skiing
magazine in the library.
   ``I'm going home,'' said student Carmen Espinosa.
   But another student, Brendon Curland, said it was better to go
to school because there would be too many distractions trying to
work at home.
   Yakima's 709 teachers walked out Monday night in a dispute over
class size, pay for extracurricular activities, teacher
evaluations, grievance procedures and use of teacher aides.
   Administrators had recorded video lessons and on Tuesday, the
first day of classes, showed them in every school while teachers
walked picket lines outside.
   Teachers urged parents to keep their children home. At Davis
High, more than half the 1,600 students were in class, but many
classrooms were empty.
   Students worked with supervision from teacher aides. Some
students talked back to the video teachers; others sipped soft
drinks, gazed out windows or talked among themselves.
   ``This guy looks cool,'' one student sneered as a lecture on the
Civil War came on the screen.
   Carolyn Wallace of the National Education Association called the
televised lessons ``high-tech scabbing.''
   ``We have never heard of anything like this,'' Ms. Wallace said
by telephone from Washington, D.C. Some districts have shown
educational films during strikes but never recorded lessons, she
said.
   Striking teachers questioned the value of the tapes.
   ``It's tough to ask a TV a question,'' said Roger Farnum, an
English teacher at Davis.
   Principal Robert McLaughlin said the video lectures follow
regular lesson plans and that teachers would pick right up from
them when they return. ``We think this is a quality education. This
is not baby-sitting,'' he said.
   ``But it's not as good as having my instructors here,'' he
acknowledged.
   The tapes were supplemented Tuesday by four pages of advertising
in the local newspaper containing lesson plans and assignments for
students.
   The tapes also were shown over two educational cable TV stations
controlled by the district, and students could do the work from
home for credit, said district spokeswoman Rhonda Stone.
   The district said it would pay to hook up cable for any family
of a student that didn't have the service, and for newspaper
subscriptions.
   Administrators began taping the lessons last week at the
district's TV studio and said they hoped to stay one week ahead in
the event of a lengthy strike, said McLaughlin, who is teaching
economics.
   Teacher aides, who did not strike, could oversee classrooms but
cannot do any teaching, said aide Lisa Baker. ``I make sure they
are getting their notes down,'' she said.
   Ms. Baker said some students asked her to switch channels to
MTV. In another class a boy insisted to an aide that Davis students
were allowed to have soft drinks during class. McLaughlin said they
aren't.

   Members of Congress are questioning President
Bush's decision to forgive $7 billion in debts from Egypt, saying
it could trigger pleas for similar relief and push up the federal
deficit.
   House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said Congress would
approve Bush's recommendation to reward Egypt for helping in the
Persian Gulf operation against Iraq if Egypt's participation saves
the United States substantial money.
   ``If we could avoid spending a substantial amount of money by
having Egyptian soldiers in place of American soldiers, there could
be a tradeoff there,'' Gingrich told reporters in Atlanta.
   ``I think we would have to look at the other nations that owe us
a lot, also,'' Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said today on ABC's ``Good
Morning America'' program. ``There are going to be requests from
others if we do this, undoubtedly.'' But he said he thinks there
will be a lot of support for forgiving Egypt's debt and it should
be considered.
   ``It's not as expensive if...you evaluate it in terms of the
present worth of that debt,'' Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said on
the same program. ``A lot of debt reduction's occurring around the
world. You take a look at what the world market is for it. For
example, $7 billion is in fact worth five cents on the dollar if
you try to sell it on the open market.''
   Several members of Congress said that while they support Bush's
overall policy of holding the line against further aggression by
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, they are concerned about the
repercussions of Operation Desert Shield on the already steep
federal budget deficit.
   Growing political pressure for a deal between the White House
and Congress to curb federal deficits already had thrown into doubt
the notion that money saved by the lessening of East-West tensions
could amount to a peace dividend to be applied to domestic needs.
   In asking Congress to approve a deal to write off $7 billion in
Egypt's military debt to the United States, the White House said
Bush decided on this course of action as ``a symbol of our
appreciation'' for Egypt's assistance in the gulf operations.
   But House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., said the move
``may be a little premature.'' He added, ``I would like to hear
firsthand from the administration the rationale'' for the decision.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of a Senate foreign aid
panel, said the debt forgiveness would lead to similar requests
from other nations that have suffered economically because of an
embargo on trade with Iraq.
   ``I'm not willing to double or triple our foreign aid budget
without a lot more understanding of what the United States gets out
of it,'' he said.
   Leahy predicted that such a major step involving Egypt would
trigger similar requests from Israel, Turkey, Greece, the
Philippines, Morocco, Pakistan and other nations.
   ``I know it's going to be necessary to increase some foreign aid
dollars as a result of Operation Desert Shield,'' Leahy said in an
interview. But he added, ``It looks like some in the administration
are saying let's have a blank check for foreign aid. I want to
remind them that my subcommittee's still got the checkbook.''
   Egypt has an additional $6 billion in non-military debt to the
United States and that still stands, Fitzwater said.
   He said forgiving the $7 billion debt would mean the U.S.
Treasury would forgo a payment of $750 million this year, which
would have contributed to the efforts to reduce the federal deficit.

   Three Western human rights monitors
probing alleged abuses in the restive Kosovo province were detained
by police, ordered out of Yugoslavia and barred from the country
for the next three years, diplomats said today.
   The diplomats, who asked not to be identified, said three
members of the Vienna-based International Helsinki Federation were
detained late Tuesday at their hotel in Prizren, a Kosovo town
close to the border with neighboring Albania.
   The three were ordered out of Yugoslavia within 24 hours and had
their passports stamped to bar them from the country for three
years, according to the diplomats and Lisa Lotteleicht, a group
spokeswoman in Vienna.
   A Dutchman in the delegation, identified as Barend Cohen, told
his embassy in Belgrade the group also had all its work documents
confiscated, Lotteleicht said.
   The police action followed increasingly critical reports by the
group on the human rights situation in Kosovo, an ancient Serbian
province now dominated by ethnic Albanians.
   The Serbs have taken full adminstrative control of the province,
arguing this is necessary to protect the Slav minority from alleged
ethnic Albanian harassment.
   More than 60 ethnic Albanians have died in clashes with
Serb-dominated security forces in the past 18 months as the
Albanian majority there struggles to regain autonomy.
   Serbia's tactics in Kosovo have drawn increasing criticism from
visiting Western delegations.
   Last week, 21 police and dozens of demonstrators were injured in
clashes between security forces and thousands of Albanians waiting
to greet a U.S. Congressional delegation investigating alleged
human rights abuses.
   The delegation, led by Republican Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas,
said later it was ``deeply disturbed ... (by) fresh evidence that
Serbian authorities are engaged in a systematic pattern of
violating the rights of Albanians.''
   The delegation was led by Christine von Kohl, a Danish-born
correspondent who now lives in Austria but previously spent several
years working in Belgrade. Cohen and an Austrian were the other two
detained.
   Vera Caric, head of the press department of the Yugoslav federal
government, said that neither her office nor the Foreign Ministry
had official word of the delegation's visit.
   Serbian authorities were not immediately available for comment.
   Kosovo is the heartland of Serbia's ancient medieval kingdom and
the issue of its autonomy is a highly emotional one in the state,
Yugoslavia's largest. Serbs maintain that if given self-government,
ethnic Albanians would secede and merge with neighboring Albania.

<TEXT>
   An earthquake measuring 5 on the Richter
scale caused some damage to buildings in the southeastern Cuban
city of Santiago, but no injuries were reported, a Spanish news
agency reported today.
   The state-run Spanish agency EFE cited a Cuban news report as
saying Cuban seismologists rated the earthquake as one of the
strongest in the quake-prone area in the last 10 years.
   EFE did not report an exact time for the start of the
earthquake, which occurred Tuesday evening.
   The U.S. National Earthquake Information Center said a quake of
magnitude 4.3 was felt Tuesday at Santiago de Cuba and Guantanaomo
Bay. The different Richter readings could not immediately be
reconciled.
   Anthony Gordon, a duty officer at the Guantanaomo Bay Naval
Station operated by the United States in Eastern Cuba, confirmed
the earthquake was felt at the base about 4 a.m. Tuesday.
   ``It shook me awake,'' Gordon said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake registering 5 on the scale can cause
considerable damage.
   EFE said the Cuban news agency AIN reported the tremor cracked
and split walls in some buildings, shattered windows and sent

   Adrian Phillips, a former hotel
executive and ex-president of the Miss America Pageant who saw
every crowning, has died at his home outside Atlantic City. He was
91.
   He was the last surviving charter member of the pageant
organization, and had planned to attend this year's finale on
Saturday despite his poor health, his family said in announcing the
Tuesday death.
   Phillips saw the first pageant in 1921, joined the sponsoring
organization the following year, and was elected president in 1967.
   Atlantic City Mayor James Whelan said Phillips, who maintained a
collection of resort memorabilia, was ``a walking history of
Atlantic City.''
   Born in Philadelphia, Phillips spent summers in Atlantic City,
learning the hotel business through an uncle and aunt who operated
the St. Clare Hotel.
   He moved to the resort as a teen-ager. In 1922, he began a
60-year career at the Chalfonte-Haddon Hall, a hotel that became
the city's first legal casino, Resorts International, in 1978.
   He taught hotel management at Cornell University for 20 years,
and was a past president of the Hotel Sales Management Association.
   Phillips and his wife, Emaline, observed their 68th anniversary
last month.
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by four sons, Donald of
Lower Bank, Adrian Jr. of Phoenix, Robert of Atlanta, and Steven of
Philadelphia. A memorial service is scheduled for 3 p.m. Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Western women and children detained in
Kuwait and Iraq continued leaving Iraq in small groups today, while
hundreds more waited anxiously for the government's permission to
leave.
   A regularly scheduled Iraqi Airways flight to Amman today
brought seven Britons and four Americans, airport officials said,
and more Europeans and Americans were expected on a regular
afternoon flight.
   A group of about 175 foreigners, including 24 Americans, flew to
London from Amman early today aboard a Virgin Atlantic Airlines
Boeing 747. The plane had carried 40 tons of supplies for tens of
thousands of desperate Asian evacuees from Kuwait stranded in
Jordan.
   Taleb Subah, an American teen-ager from Davenport, Iowa, was
among the Americans who arrived in Jordan on Tuesday and early
today.
   ``Kuwait was living hell,'' he said. ``You go to sleep to
bombing, and you wake up to it. It is like living Vietnam all over
again. There are lots of dead people. They throw them in the
trash.''
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said last week he will release
all women and children but keep Western men at strategic
installations to deter any foreign attack.
   Since then, however, only small groups of Western women and
children have been able to leave.
   In addition to today's regularly scheduled flights, a
French-chartered Iraqi Airways Boeing 707 was scheduled to fly from
Baghdad to Amman with 60 French women and children as well as some
Belgians, Italians, Britons, Norwegians and Spaniards, a French
Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
   An Air France jet left Paris for Amman early today to pick up
the French detainees, who had reached Baghdad by traveling overland
from Kuwait, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Daniel Bernard said
in Paris.
   The morning arrivals refused to talk to reporters as they were
hustled by a Jordanian officials through the arrival lounge to a
waiting room for flights to Europe and the United States.
   ``Please leave us alone, you will get us into trouble. We cannot
speak to you,'' one of them said.
   In Baghdad, 306 British women and children who arrived in a
seven-bus convoy from Kuwait on Tuesday night were awaiting exit
visas today, diplomats said on condition of anonymity. The group
was expected to leave Baghdad on Thursday or Friday.
   The Iraqi News Agency today quoted an unidentified government
spokesman as saying Iraq was doing its best to speed the departure
of foreign women and children.
   ``Iraq endeavors with all possible means to ensure their
departure in cooperation with concerned countries,'' the news
agency reported. It said ``all border points were open for their
departure, and the Iraqi Airways was ready to lease its aircraft
for flying them to any capital.''
   More than 700 Western detainees _ women, children and a few
ailing men _ left aboard two Iraqi Airways flights on Saturday in
the first major airlift since Saddam announced they could go. Some
evacuees also have traveled across the desert to neighboring
countries.
   But the departures of others have been complicated by Iraq's
refusal to allow foreign airlines to land in Baghdad and by long
delays in processing exit permits. About 11,000 Westerners are now
believed stranded in Kuwait and Iraq.
   Throughout Tuesday and into early today, three Iraqi Airways
jets airlifted hundreds of Westerners from Baghdad to Amman and
connecting flights home.
   Most of the evacuees were women, young children and teen-agers,
but some elderly and ailing men were also aboard the flights.
   On Tuesday, 135 foreigners, mostly West Germans, flew into Amman
on a charter from Baghdad and then transferred to a Lufthansa
flight.
   British millionaire Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Atlantic,
arrived in Amman with one of six jumbo jets he lent at the request
of Jordan's American-born Queen Noor. He said he was worried more
by the plight of stranded Asian refugees in Jordan than by
Westerners, who are oming home.
   ``What we are doing is only a pittance,'' he said. ``Children
and old people are dying. We need a massive airlift and ships. This
is something the United Nations should do.''
   He urged that all flights coming in to repatriate Asian refugees
carry supplies for the more than 100,000 people housed in squalid
camps in Jordan.

   NASA headed with confidence today
into the final hours of Columbia's countdown, which was halted once
before by fuel leaks and then by problems with one of four
telescopes aboard.
   Columbia is scheduled to blast off with seven astronauts and the
Astro observatory at 1:20 a.m. EDT Thursday.
   It will be NASA's first shuttle launch in more than four months
_ the longest gap between missions since flights resumed following
the 1986 Challenger disaster.
   ``We're not tracking any problems at the current time.
Everyone's upbeat, ready to go,'' test director Mike Leinbach said
today.
   Air Force meteorologists today were predicting an 80 percent
chance of good weather at launch time and expected the outlook to
improve as the day wore on.
   An important test was to come this afternoon, when NASA was to
begin fueling the shuttle with a half-million gallons of liquid
oxygen and liquid hydrogen. A hydrogen leak forced NASA to scrub
Columbia's first countdown on May 30. The leaky hydrogen lines were
later replaced.
   ``There will be a little apprehension, of course, on all of our
parts,'' program manager Bill Huddleston said Tuesday. ``But we
have all the confidence in the world that we've got this problem
resolved.''
   A launch attempt set for the weekend was scrubbed after NASA
lost contact with Astro's X-ray telescope, secured alongside three
ultraviolet telescopes in Columbia's cargo bay. The problem was
corrected, allowing another countdown.
   The latest delay required a juggling of Astro's observing
schedule, said Arthur Davidsen, principal investigator of Johns
Hopkins University's ultraviolet telescope. About 150 high-energy
objects will be observed during the nine- to 10-day flight, some of
them millions of degrees hot.
   Astronomers now will be able to observe Jupiter, which was too
close to the sun last week, Davidsen said. But an important quasar
_ the brightest one _ has moved too close to the sun and will not
be visible to Astro.
   The $150 million observatory had been scheduled for a ride on
Columbia in 1986, but the Challenger disaster two months earlier
put all missions on hold.
   It will be the first scientific mission in five years dedicated
entirely to scientific research. Astro will remain on board and
return to Earth for possible re-use.
   The mission will be the first shuttle flight since April, when
Discovery put the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit. The telescope
was later found to have a flawed mirror that produces blurry images.
   That news quickly was followed by the discovery that Atlantis
had hydrogen leaks similar to Columbia's. NASA briefly grounded the
three-shuttle fleet, and Atlantis' secret military flight was
delayed from July to November.
   NASA has wasted no time getting its shuttle program back on
track. While repairing Columbia and Atlantis, the space agency has
been preparing Discovery for an October flight with the Ulysses
satellite. Discovery was moved out to the other shuttle launch pad
Tuesday night.
   Ulysses is being sent on a five-year journey to explore the
sun's poles. NASA has from Oct. 5 to Oct. 23 to launch Discovery
because of Earth's alignment with the sun and Jupiter. Otherwise,
the mission must wait 13 months.

<TEXT>
   Cambodian government officials and
rebel leaders were in Jakarta today for possible meetings on a
U.N.-supported peace plan. The talks, scheduled to begin Thursday,
may bring together representatives of Premier Hun Sen's
Vietnam-backed government and leaders of a three-member guerrilla
coalition.
   But plans for the meetings seemed threatened Tuesday after
disputes over who would represent the various groups.
   Coalition leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk said earlier this week
he would be represented by his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Hun
Sen said he would send a subordinate because Sihanouk would not be
in Jakarta. Then the Khmer Rouge said it would boycott the talks
because Hun Sen had withdrawn.
   Son Sann, leader of the third element in the coalition, said he
was ``prepared to hold talks on Cambodia despite the absence of Hun
Sen.''
   ``I hope Hun Sen will be coming soon ... If they are serious,
they will come,'' said Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan said after
arriving in Jakarta.
   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas arranged for no more than
three days of informal talks on a peace plan adopted Aug. 28 by the
five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
   The plan, approved by the United States, the Soviet Union,
China, Britain and France, calls for a truce and U.N. supervision
before elections. It also proposes a Supreme National Council of
representatives from the four Cambodian factions.
   Khieu Samphan said he hoped his arrival would encourage Hun Sen
to make an appearance.
   All three guerrilla factions welcomed the U.N. plan. Phnom Penh,
however, expressed support for a major U.N. role, but said it
should retain power in the interim period.
   The peace plan, originally proposed by Australia, appears to
offer the best hope to end the decades-old conflict.
   Millions have been killed in Cambodia since 1970, when a coup
ended three decades of rule by Sihanouk. The Khmer Rouge won a
civil war in 1975 and ruled the nation for three years. It's blamed
for the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people in efforts to
create a new agrarian society.
   The Soviet-backed Vietnamese invaded in December 1978. Guerrilla
combat and near famine in 1979 drove hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians to U.N. refugee camps in Thailand.
   The Hun Sen government comprises largely Khmer Rouge defectors.
   Sihanouk said from Beijing that he was not coming to Jakarta
because Hun Sen should negotiate with Son Sann, who is premier of
the resistance coalition.
   Sihanouk also said he doesn't want bilateral talks with Hun Sen
because a solution must be worked out among all four Cambodian
factions.
   The Khmer Rouge receives weapons and supplies from China. Moscow
backs the Phnom Penh government and the United States supports the
non-communist factions under Sihanouk and Son Sann.

   The city police chief has ordered regular
patrols of Jewish sites after a vandal scrawled hate graffiti on a
monument at Umschlagplatz, where Jews were put aboard trains to the
Treblinka death camp in World War II.
   The graffiti, which said ``The only good Jew is a dead Jew,''
was discovered early Monday at the monument, which was dedicated in
April 1988 on the 45th anniversary of the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto
Uprising.
   Authorities were alerted by residents, but the graffiti was not
removed until Tuesday due to bureaucratic shuffling, the newspaper
Gazeta Wyborcza reported.
   ``This deserves contempt. This hurts, wounds, and casts a shadow
on the great majority of Poles who consider such an act as
sordid,'' said government Minister Aleksander Hall.
   Hall, representing Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's Cabinet,
laid flowers at the monument Tuesday to honor the Jewish victims.
   ``Not only the church but the whole nation condemns and
distances itself from such deeds. They can only be the act of
irresponsible and immoral people,'' said Bishop Wladyslaw Miziolek,
quoted by Gazeta Wyborcza.

   Britain today pledged to contribute to a
U.S.-organized fund to share costs of the Persian Gulf operation
against Iraq, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the
European portion of his fund-raising tour a success.
   A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Mrs.
Thatcher promised a contribution but offered no specific amounts,
and Brady told reporters after his 45-minute meeting at 10 Downing
Street that he was pleased by the response.
   ``We didn't talk specific amounts, but she was tremendously
supportive and indicated that the plan we had outlined to her was
one with which she agreed,'' Brady said.
   Brady left immediately for Seoul, where he was to hold talks
with South Korean President Roh Tae-woo on Friday before heading to
Tokyo, the last stop on his four-nation journey, to meet with
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   At a news conference, Brady rejected suggestions that European
and Asian leaders might resent being leaned on by the United States
to put up more money for the Persian Gulf campaign.
   ``Quite the contrary, Mrs. Thatcher thought it was exactly the
right thing to do,'' Brady said.
   Earlier, Brady had said he believed increased assistance would
be forthcoming once the allies review the details of the American
proposal more closely.
   But he said his four-day fund-raising marathon may not bear
fruit until the allies have a chance to study the U.S. proposals
and their own economic assessment of the situation in more detail.
   Brady met with French government officials on Tuesday.
   The administration is seeking more than $25 billion in economic
assistance to defray the military and economic costs of the
campaign to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said following his
discussions with Brady late Tuesday in Paris that the two had
enjoyed a ``very constructive conversation and we will look at
these problems in the near future.''
   U.S. officials said the French had told Brady that the question
of increased European economic assistance would be taken up at a
meeting of officials of the 12-nation European Community on Friday.
   For his part, Brady gave what amounted to a pep talk to the
allies, contending that they were close to putting into place the
final pieces of a three-part strategy to resolve the Mideast crisis.
   He said that strategy focused on the trade embargo approved by
the United Nations, the military buildup led by the United States
and economic assistance to provide ``staying power'' for the first
two efforts.
   ``There is diplomatic support, there is military support and now
we have the job of providing economic support,'' Brady said.
   Brady's globe-girdling jaunt was one of two administration
efforts to round up economic support. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III was scheduled to leave Washington tonight on a similar
mission to oil-rich countries of the Middle East, with later stops
planned in West Germany and Italy.
   The administration has a lot riding on its fund drive. It fears
that without a substantial flow of economic assistance Third World
nations especially hurt by the loss of trade with Iraq will begin
violating the embargo.
   Officials speaking to reporters aboard Brady's plane said a
critical need at present was to get commitments for $10 billion or
more to provide assistance to Turkey, Jordan and Egypt, the three
countries suffering the most economically from the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   In addition, the Brady mission was discussing allied support to
help defray the cost of the huge U.S. military buildup.
   Japan and West Germany, two economic superpowers who depend on
Mideast oil, are being looked to along with Saudi Arabia and the
exiled government of Kuwait to help provide perhaps $1.1 billion a
month or more to cover such U.S. costs as transportation and
housing for military forces.
   The administration also was discussing raising funds to help the
emerging democracies of Eastern Europe and other countries such as
Brazil and the Philippines cope with higher oil prices.

<HEAD>Only Nuclear Plant Canceled, 20-Year Energy Policy Outlined</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction of Poland's only nuclear
power plant project has been halted under a new policy stressing
coal and other natural energy sources, the official news agency
reported today.
   Work on the four 440-magawatt reactors began in 1983 and the
first reactor was scheduled to start producing electricity as early
as next year.
   But concerns about rising costs and environmental dangers have
plagued the plant at Zarnowiec on the Baltic coast northwest of
Gdansk. Demonstrations against the project intensified following
the 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the Soviet Ukraine.
   Prime Minster Tadeusz Mazowiecki's Cabinet voted to stop work on
the plant and devise a plan to sell off components.
   ``The costs of the completion of the investment would probably
exceed construction costs of a conventional plant of equal
performance,'' the Council of Ministers said following its decision
Tuesday, the PAP news agency reported.
   Work was stopped last year on Poland's only other nuclear
project, located in Klempicz, about 150 miles west of Warsaw. That
plant was to have four 1,000-megawatt reactors, also of Soviet
design.
   Under the new energy policy, development of nuclear power is not
envisioned until at least the year 2000, and then only in ``a
limited scope,'' according to PAP.
   The plan, worked out by the Solidarity-led government, urged
continued reliance on coal, but supported a shift to more efficient
energy sources such as natural gas, crude oil and water power.

<HEAD>Judge's Ruling Puts PTL Purchase in Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge has thrown into
jeopardy the $52 million deal by a San Diego evangelist to purchase
the assets of the PTL ministry once headed by Jim Bakker.
   ``This deal is in big, big trouble,'' said Dennis Shedd, the
court-appointed trustee overseeing the sale of the defunct
religious empire near Fort Mill, 10 miles south of Charlotte, N.C.
   ``I don't think people are aware of how serious this is, but
they should be,'' Shedd said after a bankruptcy court ruling
Tuesday.
   Judge Thurmond Bishop ruled against the preferential right that
evangelist Morris Cerullo claimed to negotiate an extension of
PTL's contract for satellite time from Home Box Office.
   HBO officials said they can strike a better deal for their
satellite time from someone else.
   Without the network, Cerullo's plan could crumble.
   ``We're going to have to regroup and decide whether to appeal or
whatever we have to do,'' Shedd said.
   If Cerullo decides PTL isn't worth buying without the satellite
time and backs out of the deal, he stands to lose a $7 million
non-refundable deposit for the network and an additional $1 million
deposit for the remaining assets of PTL's bankrupt Christian
retreat and theme park.
   The issue Tuesday involved a contract Bakker signed with HBO in
1985 to sublease satellite time that allowed PTL to beam its gospel
to cable TV systems serving millions of people.
   Bakker's Inspirational Satellite Network and broadcast
facilities reached about 800 cable systems and 7 million cable
households in the United States at its peak.
   The contract, calling for monthly payments of $242,000, expires
in February.
   Cerullo wanted HBO to approve the transfer of ownership for the
few remaining months. He also wanted to negotiate an extension of
the contract so he could continue to use HBO's leased satellite
capacity.
   Chicago lawyer James Cherney represented HBO in court Tuesday
and argued that Cerullo does not have the right under his agreement
to purchase PTL to negotiate with them concerning an extension of
Bakker's original contract.
   Bishop ruled in favor of HBO.
   If the judge's ruling is not appealed and stands, HBO could sign
a contract with anyone for the satellite time.
   An HBO official told The Herald of Rock Hill on Tuesday it is
unlikely they would sign an agreement with Cerullo.
   ``We got a much better offer from Turner (Broadcasting System)
and we'd feel a lot better with him on board than Cerullo,'' he
said.
   Tim Treadwell, attorney for Cerullo, refused to comment after
the judge's decision.
   Earlier this summer, Cerullo received court permission to buy
PTL's remaining assets, including the 2,200-acre Heritage USA. The
property, closed since Hurricane Hugo struck in September 1989,
includes two 500-room luxury hotels, a theme park, five
restaurants, a shopping mall, a water park, conference center,
housing projects and more than 1,500 acres of undeveloped land.
   Cerullo announced in August he planned a $15 million facelift
for the retreat before reopening it in mid-1991.
   PTL has been in bankruptcy since June 1987 when Bakker resigned
amid a sex-and-money scandal. He is now serving a 45-year-old
federal prison sentence for conspiracy and defrauding his followers
of millions of dollars.

   Researchers are intrigued by a report
linking a virus to chronic fatigue syndrome, but say more study is
needed before the cause of the mysterious debilitating illness is
known.
   A study released Tuesday said evidence of a type of virus known
as a retrovirus was found in the blood of 23 of 30 victims of the
syndrome. Many of their healthy relatives also showed evidence of
the virus, suggesting it is contagious, the researchers said.
   ``It's very interesting and it definitely needs to be followed
up,'' said Ann Schluederberg, chief of the virology branch of the
National Institutes of Health. She said a more direct
cause-and-effect must be established.
   ``There are things about it that make it not at all implausible
_ just more has to be done,'' she said.
   The findings mean hope for treatment for those who suffer from
the syndrome, and vindication for those who were told the symptoms
were all in their heads.
   ``It's very encouraging, very important,'' said Marya Grambs,
director of the Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome
Foundation in San Francisco,
   ``This is first time anything has been published, but the
information and suspicion has been very clear for a while,'' she
said.
   The foundation _ one of four national groups dedicated to the
illness _ estimates 3 to 10 million Americans are afflicted.
   The disease starts with flulike symptoms and can develop into
overwhelming fatigue and depression. Other symptoms include muscle
and joint pain, headaches, fever, sore throat, memory lapses and
depression.
   Because the symptoms mimic those of many other diseases, it is
often misdiagnosed, she said.
   ``It's so critical that this disease is recognized by the
government and medical community so it can be aggressively
researched, so people who have it can be validated, and not told
they're crazy,'' she said.
   Because it was widely reported among well-educated women in
their 30s and 40s, the syndrome was dubbed ``yuppie flu.''
   The new findings were presented Tuesday at a neuropathology
conference in Kyoto, Japan, by Elaine DeFreitas of the Wistar
Institute in Philadelphia; Dr. Paul Cheney of Charlotte, N.C.; and
Dr. David Bell of Lyndonville, N.Y.
   ``If it turns out to be the agent causing this, then we learn
something about treatment and something about prevention,'' said
Walter J. Gunn, principal CFS investigator for the federal Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta. ``It has the potential to be a very
important study.''
   But the research must be replicated several times before it is
accepted by the scientific and medical community, Gunn said.
   ``This is an extremely tricky area,'' he said. ``It would not be
hard to make a mistake.''
   DeFreitas herself told The Charlotte Observer: ``I don't think
any of us understands what this thing is, or how it's transmitted
or what the role of this agent is in this disease. Certainly the
studies have to be replicated.''
   Using a new laboratory technique, DeFreitas found that nine of
11 adults and 14 of 19 children had blood cells containing a viral
sequence similar to the human T-cell lymphotropic retrovirus,
specifically HTLV-II.
   The HTLV family of retroviruses is linked with leukemia, chronic
diseases of the central nervous system and AIDS.
   DeFreitas also checked 10 healthy adults and 10 healthy babies
as controls, and none showed the presence of such virus-positive
blood cells.
   The researchers checked outwardly healthy relatives and close
friends of the CFS patients. They found that 43 percent of those
exposed to the sick adults tested positively and 29 percent of
those exposed to the sick children tested positively.
   ``Retroviruses are not supposed to be casually transmitted among
humans,'' Cheney told the Observer. ``Maybe we found the one that
is.''
   The CDC is conducting a study to estimate how many people have
the disease, Gunn said. The center gets 1,000 to 2,000 phone calls
a month from people who suspect they have CFS, he said.

   Eight young men arrested in the stabbing death
of a tourist from Utah in a subway station belonged to a gang that
required would-be members to mug someone as an initiation rite, it
was reported today.
   Former members said the gang robbed people ``for the hell of
it'' and to get money to go dancing, The New York Times reported.
   The youth suspected of wielding the murder weapon has claimed
the victim, Brian Watkins, 22, ran into his knife and the stabbing
was accidental, New York Newsday and the New York Post quoted
police as saying.
   Newsday said the suspect, Yull Garry Morales, 18, told
investigators: ``There was fighting. I took out my knife to protect
myself and the guy turned and it went into him.''
   Police said Watkins had come to his family's defense late Sunday
when gang members sliced open his father's pants and punched his
mother in the mouth as they waited for a subway train.
   The gang took credit cards and about $200 in cash to go dancing,
police said. After the stabbing, the gang headed to a nearby dance
club, where five of the suspects were arrested, police said. Three
others were arrested later.
   The Watkins family was in New York on an annual visit to see the
U.S. Open tennis tournament.
   Police said they believe gang founder Morales stabbed Watkins
and also imposed the admission requirement. Morales was one of two
gang members who did not have a police record, police said.
   ``If you wanted to be in that gang you had to beat somebody up
or mug somebody,'' the Times quoted former gang member Raymond
Serrano, 19, as saying.
   The suspects, in their late teens or early 20s, were charged
with murder and robbery and were held without bail. If convicted,
they face 15 years to life in prison for murder, and additional
time for the other charges.
   Watkins was the 18th person slain in the subway system this year.

   The United States and its allies must plan a
new ``regional security structure'' for the Middle East that would
not only stop Iraqi aggression but deal with future crises in the
region, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today.
   ``This is not the last crisis of this nature we are likely to
face in this region,'' Baker said of Iraq's invasion last month of
Kuwait.
   ``It is worthwhile to begin considering regional security
structures ... that would guarantee an equilibrium in this region
that will produce peace'' and ``create a more durable order,''
Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Baker cautioned that planning for such a structure has barely
begun, and he said it would not necessarily have to be modeled on
the Western NATO alliance or involve a leading role for the United
States.
   But on Tuesday, at a similar hearing before the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, Baker compared the function of such a regional
alliance to NATO's role in containing the Soviet Union following
World War II.
   After Tuesday's session, Baker told a reporter that the
structure could be military in nature or diplomatic and political.
He told the House panel it should include ``major Arab
participation.''

<TEXT>
   Iraq's foreign minister met today with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis
just four days before a U.S.-Soviet summit meeting, Tass reported.
   The meeting between Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and Gorbachev
took place in the Kremlin, the official news agency said. It gave
no further details.
   Tass reported that Aziz's visit would be short, and the Iraqi
Embassy said he would be in Moscow overnight. His counterpart,
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, is in Tokyo.
   Gorbachev is to meet with President Bush Sunday in Helsinki in a
hastily arranged summit.
   Gorbachev also met today with a group of American senators led
by Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan. Dole said Tuesday that they would be
discussing Gorbachev's views on the Persian Gulf.
   In an interview with the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda
published today, Iraqi ambassador Ghafil Jassim Hussein said
Baghdad hopes the Soviet Union ``will be able to play a role of
peacemaker and remain a true friend to the Arabs.''
   ``We are keeping in constant contact with the Soviet side,'' he
was quoted as saying. ``We have common points of view directed at a
peaceful settlement of the conflict.''
   Tass said the Soviet Union believes it necessary to maintain
``constant diplomatic contact with the leadership of Iraq.'' It
repeated the Soviet policy of using diplomatic means to persuade
Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait and restore its
independence.
   In Tokyo, Shevardnadze issued a joint statement with Japanese
Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama condemning the Iraqi invasion.

<HEAD>Opening Arguments Begin in Iran-Contra Tax Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEB RIECHMANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A federal prosecutor warned jurors today they
would enter a strange world during the trial of an ex-CIA agent
accused of not paying taxes on his share of Iran-Contra arms
profits and hiding some of it in Switzerland.
   ``The evidence will take you into a world you are unfamiliar
with,'' Stuart E. Abrams told jurors in opening arguments. ``It's a
world of international arms deals, secret financial accounts and a
world in which financial transactions are made in large sums of
money.''
   Thomas G. Clines, 62, of Middleburg, Va., is on trial for
allegedly under-reporting arms sale earnings on his 1985 and 1986
tax returns. He also is charged with failing to tell the Internal
Revenue Service about overseas bank accounts.
   Clines and others allegedly sold arms to Iran, then used some of
the profits to supply weapons to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua at
a time when such aid was banned by Congress. Some of the money was
kept in a foreign account code-named ``C.Tea,'' according to the
congressional Iran-Contra report issued in November 1987.
   The government contends Clines reaped about $882,000 in
commissions.
   Clines pleaded innocent March 9 to all four counts of an
indictment returned Feb. 22. If convicted of all crimes, he could
be fined up to $1 million and sentenced to 16 years in prison.
   Clines reported gross receipts of $265,000 for the tax year 1985
and $402,513 for 1986, prosecutors said.
   Abrams told jurors that Clines received 20 percent of arms sales
profits in 1985 and 30 percent in 1986.
   ``Some of the money he sent back to banks in the United States,
but not all of it,'' Abrams said. Hundreds of thousands of dollars
were transferred into the Swiss account, he said.
   Defense attorney Paula M. Junghans told the jurors in her
opening statements that Clines is looking forward to the
opportunity to explain his side.
   ``Don't assume because the government has amassed all this
paperwork that something must be wrong,'' she told the jurors.
``There is no charge in this case that says it is a crime to buy
and sell arms.''
   Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord is expected to be
the first government witness.
   Secord enlisted Clines, a 29-year CIA agent-turned-investor and
consultant, as the primary broker for the arms deals in 1985 and
1986, according to the congressional report.
   Secord and Iranian-born businessman Albert Hakim operated the
``Enterprise,'' a maze of companies set up to carry out the arms
sales to Iran and the military supply shipments to the Contras.
   Prosecutors said the Enterprise was formed at the request of
former national security adviser John Poindexter and Oliver North,
a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who was a National Security
Council staff member.
   The Enterprise took in nearly $48 million _ $12.2 million more
than its expenditures _ during its first two years of operation,
the congressional report said. Secord, Hakim and Clines took
commissions from the $12.2 million surplus to ``reward themselves
for their work on arms deliveries,'' the report said. ``The
commissions totaled approximately $4.4 million.''
   Prosecutors have alleged that Secord made more than $1 million
from his role, while Secord has maintained that he made no more
than $250,000.
   Secord pleaded guilty Nov. 8, 1989, to one felony count of
making false statements to the Iran-Contra congressional
committees. He was sentenced in January to two years of probation.

<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the murder trial of
actor Marlon Brando's son has been replaced at the request of
prosecutors, who protested the lowering of Christian Brando's bail.
   Superior Court Judge David Perez was replaced Tuesday by
Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas after prosecutors filed an
affidavit of prejudice against Perez. Brando's trial is scheduled
for Oct. 1.
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys are allowed to challenge a
judge once without explanation.
   ``We were upset because of reduction of bail,'' said Deputy
District Attorney William Clark, a co-prosecutor in the case.
Prosecutors have argued that Christian Brando is a flight risk and
should have been denied bail.
   Perez reduced Brando's bail from $10 million to $2 million on
Aug. 10.
   Brando was released from jail five days later after his father
posted bond with the deed to his hilltop Bel Air estate. Estimates
of the home's value range from $4 million to $5.1 million.
   ``Christian Brando would not think twice about having (his
father) lose his house,'' Clark said. ``Marlon Brando could make
enough money on one film before the end of the year to buy another
house.''
   Christian Brando, 32, has pleaded innocent in the shooting death
of his half-sister's boyfriend, Dag Drollet, 26, at the Brando
estate on May 16.

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on the savings and loan industry:
   It seems that each day brings more bad news about the savings
and loan mess. The latest quarterly review of the industry by the
Office of Thrift Supervision documents a dramatic decline.
   Even the healthiest thrifts are showing an increase in losses
and defaulted loans. And the number of those healthy thrifts is
dwindling. In the recent survey, the OTS dropped 106 savings and
loans from its list of well-capitalized and profitable
institutions. Fewer than half the thrifts in the country _
excluding those taken over by the government _ can now be
considered in robust financial health.
   An even darker portent: The rot is spreading from Texas and the
Southwest into the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states. California,
long considered the safest territory for the industry, is also
feeling the pinch.
   Washington has yet to get serious about the savings and loan
scandal. Posturing and fingerpointing are the order of the day.
   Our national leaders may choose to whistle past the graveyard,
but the data don't lie. The savings and loan industry is dying a
slow and agonizing death. And the taxpayer must pay for its
expensive funeral.

   The Sun Herald, Biloxi, Miss., on the census:
   Count the cats and count the dogs. Count the chickens and the
hogs. Count the bathrooms in your house. Count your children and
your spouse. Count each phone and plumbing pipe _ plastic, copper
or other type. Who wrote these questions?
   Amid the jokes, census horror stories keep cropping up: a small
town where 75 percent of the residents never received forms, widely
publicized ``help lines'' that were either always busy or never
answered.
   It appears that the 1990 census is full of bloopers, and
nationwide, population tallies are on the low side. ...
   Thousands of cities are challenging the census figures and
providing evidence of their own, which the Census Bureau considers,
then may or may not make adjustments. This slow, complicated
process may be the best we can do to rectify 1990 inaccuracies,
even though it puts an extra burden on the cities and states that
should not have been necessary.
   We must mop up the census mess as best we can and move forward.
Above all, we must learn from 1990's errors. A problem-solving task
force of individuals _ forget titles, pick the best brains _ from
the Census Bureau, the Postal Service, key cities, minority groups,
any problem areas _ should be at work right now. Ten years of
planning should be plenty.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on housing problems:
   Once again, Congress has left to the last minute its annual
renewal of two tax breaks that are needed to alleviate pressing
housing problems.
   A mortgage revenue bond program essential to first-time
homebuyers of moderate means, as well as tax credits needed to keep
rental units affordable to the poor, will expire later this year
unless they are extended. We believe neither program should be
allowed to lapse because of the unresolved federal budget dispute.
   Ironically, both enjoy wide support in Congress: Some 300
lawmakers have endorsed them. ... However, there is always the
danger they could fall between the boards as bigger fiscal issues
monopolize attention. To avoid that, Congress should promptly pass
bills to renew these programs when legislators reconvene this month.

   The Florence (S.C.) Morning News on scientific discoveries:
   Although the headlines and news shows are often dominated by the
big events such as blockades, troop movements and the stock
markets, very often major improvements in society are done in small
ways. Microscopic ways to be exact.
   Scientists at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore
have isolated a gene that prevents colonies of cancer tumors from
growing. The gene, called p53, could lead to finding natural
proteins to switch off cancer. P53 is one of a group of what is
known as suppressor genes because they appear to act as a brake on
cancer formation. Suppressor genes have been found to be either
missing or mutated in the cells of several types of solid cancer
tumors, researchers have noted.
   There is still a long way to go, and many things to study,
before the experiments become a treatment for cancer patients but
it is an example of genetic research and the enormous benefits it
has for mankind.
   Last month, the genetic revolution progressed when a federal
panel for the first time approved two gene therapies for tests on
humans. Within a year, scientists should know whether the tests are
effective against a lethal skin cancer and a rare deficiency of the
immune system.
   It is true that genetic experimentation is fraught with dangers,
but so is every human endeavor. Our ancestors probably thought fire
was a great advance until they realized that they, too, could burn.
Nevertheless, they kept setting fires. ...
   No doubt there will be abuses in the research. Not once in all
of history has there not been abuses in research. But there have
also been tremendous advances. In the 21st century, and perhaps
before, the genetic revolution may well remake society even more
than the computer revolution has changed work and leisure in the
latter part of the 20th century.
   Obviously, careful study and planning are needed. We do not know
the pitfalls that await in genetic research. But to stop would be
akin to our ancestors putting out fire because someone slipped and
fell in the flames.

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on opening the Raoul Wallenberg
files:
   Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat, saved the lives of as many
as 100,000 Jews in Hungary during the closing months of World War
II. Then Wallenberg vanished, an apparent victim of bloodthirsty
Soviet secret police who suspected he was a spy.
   But reports that Wallenberg may have survived into the 1980s,
and still may even be alive, have intrigued investigators of the
stature of the late Andrei Sakharov. Now the Soviet Union, in one
of the most dramatic acts of glasnost, has agreed to open its files
on Wallenberg.
   Soviet officials now say that they will open the archives of the
KGB and other agencies to an international commission investigating
the fate of Wallenberg. It is almost certainly too late to save
Wallenberg, as he saved so many others. But at least the world can
learn the truth about his fate. By refusing to give up their quest
for the truth, investigators have honored one of the century's
authentic heroes.

   Philadelphia Inquirer on the U.S.-Soviet summit:
   With each passing month, it becomes increasingly clear that the
Soviet Union is no longer America's chief adversary in the world.
Indeed, it is coming to look more and more like an ally. The (Sept.
9 U.S.-Soviet) summit's main purpose is to intensify international
pressure on Iraq's Saddam Hussein, a venture in which the United
States and Soviet Union are on the same side.
   The United States and the Soviet Union still have thousands of
nuclear warheads trained on each other's territory, and
negotiations aimed at reducing those weapons have stalled. But
we've reached a stage where the specter of deadlocked arms talks no
longer arouses a sense of foreboding.
   That could change, of course, in the unlikely event that (Soviet
President Mikhail) Gorbachev is ousted in favor of someone more
menacing. But, for now, a Bush-Gorbachev meeting reminds one less
of the superpower summits of old than of those routine
get-togethers a U.S. president has from time to time with the West
German chancellor or the British prime minister.

   The Kansas City Star on the Persian Gulf:
   As the U.S. and its allies face mounting costs in the Persian
Gulf and the possibility of a long standoff, some tempers are
getting short over what different countries should contribute to
the effort.
   Americans are complaining that other countries aren't doing as
much as they should. Japanese officials are grousing that they
aren't cash-dispensing machines. Western European politicians are
waffling over what their nations' responsibilities are. ...
   It should be remembered that absolute justice and precision are
impossible. Burden-sharing debates are hard enough at the platoon
level. Where countries are concerned, allies must weigh factors
that include size, interests, wealth, history, military
preparedness and other commitments. ...
   The U.S. has the military power to make the world a little safer
in situations like the current crisis. There is no getting around
the fact, however, that exercising that power sometimes entails
fiscal as well as substantial human costs. The fiscal costs can be
better shared.

   Los Angeles Daily News on sex discrimination in the Saudi desert:
   (W)hile doing their duty, U.S. servicewomen have been forced to
make some absurd concessions that male soldiers haven't been asked
to make, such as wearing excessive clothing in the blistering heat.
It's apparently been the military's way of making sure that
American forces don't offend their Saudi hosts, whose Islamic
customs are exceedingly repressive toward women.
   Fortunately, there are signs that relief from the heat and some
forms of discrimination are on the way; Restrictive dress rules for
military women have been relaxed on at least one U.S. military
compound in Saudi Arabia, according to the husband of an Air Force
sergeant sent to the region.
   Female soldiers are now being permitted to wear shorts in their
off-duty hours within their living area. They also may wear bathing
suits when swimming in a portable pool at the compound. ...
Servicewomen whould be given that much leeway at every military
installation in Saudi Arabia. ...
   There's a chance that any change in the rules would not sit well
with the Saudis. This is a country, after all, where women must use
separate beaches, cover most of their faces in public and are not
permitted to drive. ... But one can be respectful (of national
custom) without demeaning one's own citizens. ... In their mutual
efforts to keep Iraqi troops at bay, Americans and Saudi Arabians
are obliged to show understanding of the other's culture.

   Teacher strikes in seven states extended summer vacation for
more than 82,000 students.
   Teachers struck in at least two of 120 New Jersey school
districts that are still without contracts. Pickets blocked buses
from leaving the depot at Deptford High School in southern New
Jersey to pick up students this morning. One striker was hit by a
car, but appeared unhurt.
   Strikes in six Michigan districts idled 34,000 students and
mediation by the governor's office failed for one striking Rhode
Island district. A fourth Pennsylvania district struck today and
teachers in two Illinois districts continued their walkout.
   In Washington state, school officials gave videotaped lessons to
12,000 students in Yakima Tuesday, but striking teachers were to
vote today on a settlement. Elsewhere in that state, two other
strikes kept 31,600 students away from school.
   College professors walked out in contract disputes at Wayne
State University in Detroit and Temple University in Philadelphia,
and a strike continued at the University of Bridgeport in
Connecticut. Some classes were held Tuesday at Temple and Wayne
State and administrators planned to open the Connecticut campus
tonight.
   In New Jersey, classes at Union County College's four campuses
were canceled today for 10,000 students as striking professors
picketed. The school and professors failed to reach agreement on a
contract, which expired Friday.
   Negotiations in the South Orange-Maplewood school system broke
down early today and the union representing 572 New Jersey teachers
and staff planned to picket all nine schools, union spokesman
Farrell Fand said.
   In Deptford, teachers were on strike this morning after the
331-member Deptford Education Association voted Tuesday to set up
pickets. Talks broke down early Tuesday, said association president
Fred Kier.
   ``We're tired of being driven up against the wall,'' said Kier.
``We're getting nowhere and we've decided to take a stand.''
   Teachers in New Orleans aren't asking anything immediately for
themselves, but say they'll strike Sept. 17 if the school board
doesn't come up with $2 million for support staff.
   An estimated 3,400 to 4,000 members of the United Teachers of
New Orleans overwhelmingly voted Tuesday to strike and work for the
recall of the school board if the money isn't forthcoming by the
Sept. 17 deadline to increase salaries of teachers' aides,
secretaries and other clerical workers. The union represents 4,700
teachers and 1,000 other school workers.
   Teachers have received pay raises from the state for the past
three years, but no extra money from the school board since 1988.
   Union president Nat Lacour said the proposal would give 4 to 5
percent raises to teachers' aides, who make about $10,000 a year,
and to clerical workers, who make about $17,000.
   Tuesday's meeting on the first day of classes in the
84,000-student district caused thousands of teachers to be late for
school.
   ``The issue is whether the school system has any more money to
give them. The answer to that question is an unequivocal no,'' said
Rose Drill-Peterson, spokeswoman for the school board.
   In Rhode Island, classes for 4,400 students in North Kingstown
were postponed today for at least one more day after mediators
worked until 1 a.m. trying to reach an agreement, said Edwin
Nordstrom, School Committee chairman.
   In Washington, classes were called off through Friday for about
22,500 students in the Lake Washington School District, which
covers Seattle suburbs, and through Monday for 9,100 students in

   Sunday Mail, Harare, Zimbabwe, on the Persian Gulf:
   Once Western economies wobble, the ripple effects reach
developing countries sooner rather than later. And ... the effect
(of the crisis in the Persian Gulf) will be felt when many
developing countries are perhaps most vulnerable.
   Many have adopted export-led structural adjustment programs and
if a recession, however mild, is added to the growing trend in
trade protectionism in the West, those programs could stumble and
fall.
   This once again highlights the importance of developing
countries to lessen their present almost total reliance on Western
markets for both exports and imports.
   ---Aug. 30
   The Statesman, Calcutta, India, on the Persian Gulf:
   For all the aggressive bluster and massing of troops and
warships in the area, a political solution to the crisis in the
Persian Gulf cannot be ruled out. ...
   (W)hile prone to miscalculating the consequences of his
aggression, (Iraqi President Saddam) Hussein has a sensible
appreciation for the mailed fist for he wields one himself after
all.
   Militarily he cannot hope to match the West. ... He must,
therefore, consider withdrawal from Kuwait.

   The Guardian, London, on the Persian Gulf:
   Because America is the greatest democracy, it cannot adequately
play the part of freedom's flying squad.
   The bitter ghosts of the Vietnam venture are not exorcized: they
are one of the dominant themes of Hollywood at the start of the
'90s. The controlled experiments of Grenada and Panama _ sanitized
war, with no bodies in the bag for the cameras _ have not
reconciled the American voter, the human being with human rights,
to a world where thousands upon thousands of lives may be put in
jeopardy in foreign fields.
   The myth of a high-tech war fought by fighting machines at long
range is just that: a myth. The mirror image of a television world
which showed the citizens of the Soviet Union what economic misery
they were enduring is that those same screens will show dead
Americans and dead civilians caught up in a melee of bloodshed.
   There is no long-term reality to this role. It is not what
democracies are about. It is an attempt by old minds, left bereft
by the crumbling of the Cold War, to construct a new order which
merely echoes the simplicities of the past.
   In fact there is only one global policeman. That, for its
frailties, is the United Nations, because it represents the
collective wisdom of a world of many nations and infinite systems
of government. It is not the excuse for action in the Gulf. It is,
for good or ill, the pivot of it.

   Straits Times, Singapore, on the Soviet Union:
   It is getting increasingly difficult these days to fault Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev for radicalism. The man who began his
career at the Kremlin as an undoubted revolutionary, though of the
peaceful variety, shows signs, five years later, of transformation
into an Establishment figure who lives an uneasy life between the
nostalgia of revolution and the realities of power. ...
   He acknowledged last week that there was public scepticism over
the reform program. An economic collapse of the country could not
be ruled out, as could not serious tears in its political fabric.
...
   If his reforms are to mean anything, they must not only move
forward but gather momentum. An honest and speedy transition to a
market economy is a necessity, not a luxury. ...
   Gorbachev can take heart that there is someone who understands
just how critical matters are. Russian Federation President Boris
Yeltsin, whose radical posture calls for privatization, the closing
of inefficient industries and an end to heavy subsidies, has often
differed with ... Gorbachev.
   It was reported, however, that the two had agreed last week on
the need for urgent and drastic action. That cooperation will
hopefully come about and continue. The Kremlin leader needs all the
radicals he can get to put the spirit back into the Gorbachev
revolution. In present Soviet circumstances, nothing less than a
revolution is needed to keep reform alive.

   National Concord, Lagos, Nigeria, on the proposal that African
nation should establish a continental defense force:
   It appears that an African high command has become irrelevant to
the realities of African politics today.
   For one thing, the fact has been firmly established that African
nations do not share a common ideological perspective, and the
operations of the proposed defense force would only subject the
Organization of African Unity to intense controversy and
unnecessary acrimony.
   Furthermore, most of the problems plaguing various countries are
so local in nature that they do not warrant the intervention of a
continental force.
   In these circumstances, the OAU should perhaps think of a
contingency arrangement whereby a peacekeeping force could be put
together when the need arises.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today that even though the
government is occupied with the Persian Gulf crisis, progress is
being made in the fight against illegal drugs, which remains a top
priority.
   ``I know that other subjects preoccupy all of us these days. But
this one remains number one, will continue to remain number one
when the international situation has calmed down,'' the president
said.
   In remarks to a group of staff and reporters a year after he
laid out his drug war strategy, Bush declared:
   ``I think America is making progress against drugs and will
continue to do so.''
   He cited a decrease in casual drug use and decreased
availability of cocaine.
   Bush's chief lieutenant in the fight against drugs provided a
more detailed assessment of the administration's contention that
the war is being won.
   ``Last year's hopeless cause is this year's revived opportunity
for victory,'' national drug policy director William J. Bennett
said in remarks to the gathering marking the anniversary of Bush's
drug speech.
   ``I think a prudent and cautious judgment on our present
circumstances would be that the drug problem _ in general,
nationwide _ is no longer getting worse, and in some very
significant aspects it is now getting better. Not victory, but
success,'' Bennett said.
   In an interview Tuesday, Bennett contrasted the current drug
picture with the situation when he took office 18 months ago.
   At the time, he recalled, people said his job was ``undoable.
Mission Impossible. Figurehead. Nothing can happen.''
   Instead, Bennett said, ``The government actually can get some
things done if it is given the right equipment, the right direction
and the command of the president, and we made some progress.''
   However, he said, this is no time to let up and stop pursuing
the drug strategy that stresses tough enforcement of drug laws when
violated by either traffickers or users as well as increased
spending on treatment and education.
   ``There's plenty more to do,'' Bennett said. ``There are some
places that are not getting better.''
   The announcement of the drug strategy last Sept. 5 was Bush's
first prime-time televised speech. In it, the president said he
wanted ``to make our streets and neighborhoods safe.'' He referred
to people being ``mugged on the way home from work by crack gangs''
and children dodging bullets as they went to school.
   In the past year, thanks in large part to Colombia's crackdown
on the cocaine cartels that was strongly supported by the United
States, the supply of cocaine to this country has decreased.
   But instead of making the streets of America safer, Bennett said
earlier this summer, the cocaine shortage increased the violence
because of greater competition among drug dealers. ``There will be
the same number of dogs fighting over a smaller number of bones,''
he said.
   Asked Tuesday whether the American people might be wondering
just what the drug war is all about if battles won cause more
violence, Bennett said ``the violence fuels the national interest
and the interest of citizens, but it isn't the only thing that
fuels their interest.''
   ``I think the largest part of the concern that people have is
how it will affect their children,'' he said.
   The high level of violence is not always connected to the drug
trade, he said. He noted that the murder rate has declined in some
cities _ Detroit, Dallas, San Francisco and San Diego _ which are
``not necessarily the same cities where we're seeing the greatest
progress in the war on drugs.''
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden, Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, was releasing a report today citing some
successes of the drug war and some failures, including an increased
number of murders this year, inadequate drug education and lack of
treatment for pregnant or incarcerated addicts.
   Rep. John Conyers, chairman of the House Committee on Government
Operations, said, ``We are losing the drug war in our inner cities.
   ``Prevention and education efforts directed at the educated
middle class appear to be having a dramatic effect,'' the Michigan
Democrat said in a statement. ``Treatment programs have room for
clients who can afford to pay. However, the chronically addicted
cannot pay when they are poor and unemployed, as is often the
case.''
   Conyers urged reallocation of the federal drug budget, spending
an equal amount on treatment and prevention as is spent on law
enforcement. The current split is almost 70 percent for law
enforcement, the rest for treatment and education.
   The National Institute on Drug Abuse recently reported that the
number of cocaine-related emergency room visits continued to
decline in the first quarter of 1990, a drop first seen in the
fourth quarter of 1989.
   The institute, which gets its figures from the Drug Abuse
Warning Network of hospital emergency rooms and coroners
nationwide, also found that the number of heroin-related emergency
room visits declined in early 1990. However, the number of people
who died with traces of cocaine or heroin in their systems
increased in 1989.
   As for attitudes, a survey released Tuesday found that an
ever-increasing segment of the American public, including
teen-agers, is rejecting illegal drugs, seeing their use as
dangerous and unattractive behavior.
   This trend was observed in all major ethnic groups _ whites,
blacks and Hispanics _ according to the survey by the Gordon S.
Black Corp.

<HEAD>Aquarium To Send Dolphin to Navy; Animal Rights Groups Angry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New England Aquarium plans to send one of its
three show dolphins to a Navy program that does research on them
and trains them for military work, a move that has prompted
protests.
   Federal records indicate it will be the fourth dolphin the
aquarium has sent to the U.S. Naval Ocean Systems Center in San
Diego in the last 10 years, The Boston Globe said today.
   The curator of marine mammals at the aquarium, Kathy Krieger,
worked for the Ocean Systems Center for two years.
   The dolphin to be sent there is Rainbow, who is about 11 years
old and is being sent because he is aggressive and incompatible
with the other two used in shows at the aquarium, she said.
   ``We feel that is the place he will get the best care,'' she
said. She admitted the aquarium does not know exactly what the Navy
plans to do with him.
   ``We know he will not be treated in an inhumane manner or be in
any danger,'' she said. ``The people who work with the animals in
the Navy assure us that none of the animals have been hurt.''
   Thomas LaPuzza, spokesman for the Navy center, said Rainbow will
be used immediately for research but he could not say whether he
ever will be used for military work.
   The Navy's dolphin program is classified. It has been criticized
for use of animals in war and for the way dolphins are treated.
   ``I'm very surprised they would plan on releasing animals to the
Navy. I'm shocked,'' Scott Van Valkenburg of the Boston Marine
Mammal Coalition, told the Globe.
   ``The fact that they might be sending animals to a program where
they might be used in military action is amazing,'' he said. The
group said it plans a protest rally Saturday.
   ``We're looking into how they are planning to transport this
dolphin,'' said Doreene Close of the Coalition to End Animal
Suffering and Exploitation. ``If we can find that out, we will do
everything in our power to stop it.''
   The Navy will send the aquarium an 11-year-old, partially deaf
female dolphin as a replacement for Rainbow, and Ms. Krieger
thought it would fit in better with the other two at the aquarium.
   LaPuzza said the Navy used dolphins for military work in Vietnam
and in 1987 in the Persian Gulf, but he would not say what they did.
   A former trainer at the Navy facility said dolphins were trained
to kill with .45-caliber guns attached to nose cones, the Globe
said. The guns would be triggered when dolphins rammed enemy
frogmen. The Navy refused to comment on those allegations.

<TEXT>
   A South Korean woman claims that a
North Korean delegate at this week's talks between the prime
ministers of North and South Korea is her long lost brother.
   Lim Chun-lim, 69, appeared on television Tuesday night saying
she had no doubt that Lim Chun-gil, 53, was the brother she saw
last in 1947 when she left her hometown in the North for a new life
in South Korea.
   About 10 million people living in the two Koreas were separated
from family members by the division of the peninsula in 1945 and
the 1950-53 Korean War. The border is sealed and there is no mail
or other direct form of communication between the nations.
   The woman, a resident of a small town outside Seoul, gave
personal and family data and described the circumstances of her
separation from her family. Her hometown is the same as that of the
North Korean delegate, South Korean officials said.
   Pictures shown of the profiles of the two Lims are strikingly
similar.
   The official, one of the most influential in the Northern
delegation, insists he is not the woman's brother. ``The claim is
simply not true,'' he said in a statement issued through a South
Korean spokesman.
   The South Korean spokesman, Kim Hyung-ki, said Lim suspected the
woman's claim was ``a plot to blur the focus of the talks.''
   Communist North Korea's main concern in the Seoul talks is
military and political matters. Other issues such as family
reunions are low on its agenda. South Korea prefers to tackle
non-political and non-military matters first.

   A bomb believed set by tribal militants
exploded in a bus in eastern India, killing 25 people and injuring
45, news reports said Wednesday.
   Police blamed Tuesday's explosion in Assam state on Bodo
tribespeople, who are agitating for a separate state, The Times of
India reported.
   The state-owned bus was parked at the town of Rangiya when the
bomb exploded, the newspaper said. United News of India said 17
bodies were recovered from the bus and eight more people died on
the way to a hospital.
   Bodos say they need their own state to protect their tribal
culture from being overwhelmed by the Assamese, who are
predominantly Hindus. The Bodos claim about one-third of Assam as
their homeland.
   Tribal leaders, state government officials and members of the
federal government are scheduled to conduct talks on the demands
next week.
   The Times of India said the explosion was an attempt by Bodos to
demonstrate militant capabilities and gain leverage at the talks.
   Assam, about 870 miles east of New Delhi, produces about 60
percent of India's tea and most of its crude oil.

   Some 2,000 Egyptian soldiers, along with
Kuwaitis who fought invading Iraqis a month ago, are manning the
front line below the Kuwaiti border, officers said Wednesday.
   These are among the visible Arab units in the multinational
force led by the United States to defend Saudi Arabia against a
possible attack by Iraq.
   The total number of Arab forces has not been disclosed, and
there has been confusion over the number of troops promised by
various Arab countries and the number actually sent.
   Saudi officers say 3,000 Syrians and the same number of
Moroccans are in the field. But correspondents taken to the sector
by the Saudi military did not see any of them.
   The reported Syrian presence would mark the first time Syrian
troops have stood beside the Egyptians since they fought Israel in
the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
   Arab forces form the first line of defense along the
northeastern desert and coastal approaches to Saudi Arabia's
oil-rich eastern province. South of them are the U.S. forces. The
desert is dotted with small encampments, anti-aircraft units,
platoons of tanks and armored personnel carriers.
   At one of the camps, Maj. Gen. Turki Al-Nufaie said he was
waiting for units to arrive to put his total force at ``a division
and a little more.''
   He commands Saudi Arabia's 20th Mechanized Brigade and the Rapid
Deployment Force made up of troops from the six Gulf Cooperation
Council states _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,
Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.
   Al-Nufaie gave no strength figures. But judging by the size of
the units described by other officers, he may be talking about
20,000 troops. Al-Nufaie said that once those troops, whom he did
not identify, reached the scene, ``we await orders to deploy to
defensive positions.''
   He said the Syrians were deployed east of his position but were
not under his command.
   Kuwait's defense minister told The Associated Press on Tuesday
that a 7,000-man force of Kuwait's 16,000-strong army was currently
``on maneuvers'' and that half of them would soon join as regulars
in northern Saudi Arabia.
   A short distance from Al-Nufaie's command post, troops
identified as Kuwaitis were dug in with armored personnel carriers
and other vehicles.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was the first Arab leader to
offer soldiers for the Saudi cause, but their status has been
marked by confusion.
   A Defense Ministry source in Cairo was quoted Aug. 16 as saying
there were 3,000 Egyptians in Saudi Arabia and 2,000 more were en
route to join them.
   On Tuesday, Egypt's state-run Middle East News Agency said an
unspecified number of Egyptian troops was en route to the United
Arab Emirates.
   Military sources have said the total in Saudi Arabia is 4,000,
including paratroopers, commandos, infantrymen and chemical warfare
specialists.
   But Egyptian commanders interviewed at their desert camp Tuesday
said 2,000 was the total number in the country.
   About 100 Egyptian soldiers could be seen at the desert
encampment Tuesday. They were equipped with a handful of jeeps,
AK-47 automatic rifles and light anti-tank weapons.
   Asked about their mission, Col. Adilan Wagdi said it was to
``defend the holy places'' of Islam _ the holy cities of Mecca and
Medina.
   After a brief discussion with aides, he said the Egyptians were
there ``to defend all of Saudi Arabia.''

   Former Sen. Lawton Chiles overcame questions about
his mental stability and swept to victory over Rep. Bill Nelson for
Florida's Democratic nomination for governor. Gov. Bob Martinez
easily captured the GOP nomination.
   In Nevada, Gov. Bob Miller crushed five challengers Tuesday for
the Democratic nomination for a full term in the job he assumed two
years ago. Businessman Jim Gallaway topped seven other Republicans
for the GOP nomination.
   Chiles' wasn't the only political comeback in Florida: Impeached
federal Judge Alcee Hastings won a slot in a Democratic runoff for
secretary of state.
   And voters in two Florida counties rejected controversial ballot
measures. In Broward, an ordinance that would have protected
homosexuals against discrimination was defeated 59 percent to 41
percent. In Sarasota, voters decided by 73 percent to 27 percent
not to slap a two-year moratorium on growth.
   Chiles and Martinez both captured 69 percent of the vote.
   Nelson, Chiles and other Democratic leaders held a unity rally
today at the state Capitol.
   ``It's awfully good to be the head of a united Democratic ticket
and I think that's what we have this time _ a united Democratic
ticket,'' Chiles said.
   Martinez greeted supporters in Tampa today, then jetted to
Miami, with stops in Orlando and Jacksonville also planned.
   ``We've reached a point where reality has to take over from
rhetoric and substances over slogans,'' Martinez said, claiming he
knows state issues and is more specific than Chiles.
   Martinez campaign manager J.M. ``Mac'' Stipanovich said Chiles
had ``retreated into overinflated '60s liberal bull that has no
place in society.''
   Chiles, a 60-year-old moderate, retired two years ago, saying he
was burned out from three terms in the Senate. At the time he was
chairman of the Budget Committee. He was diagnosed as depressed and
began using the drug Prozac.
   During the campaign, he was dogged by questions about his age
and mental stability and was pressured into releasing his medical
records.
   Nelson's running mate, state House Speaker Tom Gustafson, was
widely criticized and finally apologized for suggesting Chiles
could be suicidal. Such attacks were thought to have produced a
voter backlash in Chiles' favor.
   Chiles received 739,916 votes to 325,448 votes, or 31 percent,
for Nelson, a six-term congressman.
   Chiles told supporters his victory represented a mandate for his
campaign's theme: an attack on big-money politics. He had limited
contributions to $100 and raised $2 million. Nelson raised $6
million and spent $1 million of his own.
   ``We thought people should count more than money,'' Chiles said,
``and we felt like that people could join with us if we did limit
our contributions, and if we trusted them they would respond.''
   Nelson, a 47-year-old who went on a space shuttle mission as a
member of Congress in 1986, had claimed to have more energy and
vision to lead the state.
   Martinez, who is considered vulnerable because of his
anti-abortion stance and his support three years ago of a services
tax that later was repealed, had 457,952 votes to state Sen.
Marlene Woodson Howard's 131,782 votes, or 20 percent. Three other
contenders divided the remainder.
   Martinez said he would focus his campaign on his
administration's achievements in the environment, crime, education
reform and drugs.
   In Nevada, Miller had moved up to governor automatically from
lieutenant governor in 1988 after Gov. Dick Bryan was elected to
the U.S. Senate.
   Nearly complete returns showed Miller with 66,998 votes, or 81
percent. ``None of the Above'' _ which appears on all Nevada
ballots as a means of voter protest _ received 6,754 votes, or 8
percent. A long-shot hopeful who changed his name to Rhinestone
Cowboy ran third with 2,308 votes, or 3 percent.
   In the GOP race, Gallaway had 35,628 votes, or 50 percent,
``None of the Above'' drew 15,637 votes, or 22 percent, and builder
Charlie Brown had 14,966 votes, or 21 percent.
   Gallaway, a relative newcomer to the state, said Miller had
shown ``a total lack of leadership'' as governor. But a poll last
month of the likely matchup in November indicated Miller would
trounce Gallaway 60 percent to 27 percent.
   Hastings, who as Florida's first black federal judge was removed
by the U.S. Senate after a jury acquitted him of bribery, will face
former newspaperman Jim Minter in an Oct. 2 runoff for the
Democratic nomination for secretary of state. The winner will meet
incumbent Jim Smith, a Republican.
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Minter had 355,139
votes, or 38 percent, to 312,224 votes, or 33 percent, for
Hastings. Former Ku Klux Klansman John Paul Rogers got 273,454
votes, or 29 percent.
   Former Gov. Claude Kirk, 64, also moved toward a political
comeback, winning a three-way race for the GOP nomination for
education commissioner. Kirk, governor from 1967-71, avoided a
runoff with 54 percent of the vote.
   Kirk and Martinez are the only Republican governors in Florida
since Reconstruction.
   The Broward referendum was opposed by the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Miami and by critics who warned its passage would
bring more homosexuals and AIDS to the county.
   In Sarasota, supporters of a two-year moratorium on new
structures said it would give time to improve services and address
other problems of growth. Opponents said a halt would put thousands
out of work and damage the economy.

   The consumer group Test-Achat said Wednesday new legal standards

<HEAD>Safety Group Says Small Cars Save Gas But Not Lives</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pressure to save fuel could increase highway
deaths, an auto safety group said Wednesday in reporting new
evidence that small cars are less safe than bigger models.
   The study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
concludes that, on average, small cars are deadlier than less
fuel-efficient autos, that Japanese cars are becoming longer and
safer while American cars are becoming shorter and more dangerous,
and that when a manufacturer reduces the size of a given model, the
model becomes more dangerous.
   In a broad study begun well before the Mideast crisis brought
new attention to ways of decreasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil,
the institute said safety too often is ignored in the debate over
auto mileage standards.
   Carmakers already are required to produce cars with an average
of 27.5 miles per gallon for 1990 models. One legislative proposal
would increase fuel economy 20 percent in passenger cars by 1995
and 40 percent by 2001.
   ``Fuel-economy standards create safety problems if they force
automakers to make cars smaller in order to increase the average
miles per gallon of their fleets,'' the institute said.
   The organization, which is financed by auto insurance companies,
researches a wide range of highway safety issues.
   Institute President Brian O'Neill said there are ways to save
more fuel without making cars smaller, including engine changes
that put less importance on power and speed and measures that
relieve urban congestion.
   But carmakers say they eventually have to make cars smaller to
meet the stringent mileage standards.
   ``I'm as good an environmentalist as the next guy, but I believe
we have to look at the complete picture,'' O'Neill said.
   Smaller cars are more prone to rollovers and damage that can
injure occupants, the institute said, offering the following
evidence:
   _Based on an analysis of death rates and fuel ratings for 47
four-door cars, on average, for every one mile-per-gallon
improvement in fuel economy, there is a 3.9 percent increase in the
death rate.
   _Overall, the death rate in the smallest cars on the road is
more than double the rate in the largest cars: 3 deaths per 10,000
registered cars for the smallest cars and 1.3 for the largest in
1989.
   _The frequency of damage claims for small, two-door cars is 35
percent higher than for large two-door cars.
   _Among the 29 two- and four-door cars with the highest frequency
of injury claims, 27 are small and two are mid-sized.
   The institute said that in the 1979 model year, the average
wheelbase of Toyotas and Nissans was 15 inches shorter than the
wheelbases of domestic Ford and General Motors cars, and the death
rate in Japanese cars was 56 percent higher.
   In the 1988 model year, as the average wheelbase difference was
reduced to approximately eight inches, the death rates in the
Japanese and U.S. cars were about the same, the institute said.
   The report said that fatalities in 10 of 11 GM models increased
after smaller models of the cars were produced.
   All GM body types except the 1982 A-type cars showed increases
in the number of deaths per 10,000 registered cars after the cars
were made smaller, the report said.
   The most dramatic increase was in 1986 E-type Buick Rivieras,
Cadillac Eldorados and Olds Toronados, which were compared with the
larger 1984-85 models. The increase in the rate of deaths was 67
percent, from 0.9 per 10,000 cars to 1.5, the report said.

<DATELINE>GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The eight-year battle over the Salt
Caves hydroelectric project is a Western showdown reminiscent of
those between free-range cattlemen and fence-building homesteaders.
   But this fight is between a coalition of a city, developers, a
local congressman and a federal agency facing an alliance of state
agencies, voters, out-of-town congressmen, fishermen, and
environmentalists.
   At issue is an 11-mile stretch of the Klamath River 27 miles
southwest of Klamath Falls in south-central Oregon.
   Initial proposals by the city of Klamath Falls would have
drowned the river behind a dam, but the proposal now is for no dam
at all _ just a series of canals and conduits bringing water from
an existing dam upstream. That hasn't lessened opposition.
   The proposal now rests in two sets of hands:
   _ The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could sweep aside
most of the objections raised by state agencies simply by granting
a license.
   _ Congress is considering a bill that would block the commission
by including the Upper Klamath River in the federal wild and scenic
river system.
   ``If the agency is going to crush state and regional decisions,
we think that is another reason wild and scenic legislation should
be passed to protect this river and protect the broad range of
people opposed to this project,'' said Chris Orsinger, spokesman
for the Oregon Rivers Council, an environmental group.
   Opponents say the project would destroy the last free-flowing,
trout-filled stretch of a waterway already shackled by four dams.
   Supporters say the project can generate millions of dollars to
help Klamath Falls get back on its feet after a decade of decline.
   No customers have yet agreed to buy the dam's electricity and
opponents say the project can't make a profit.
   The federal energy commission says there is a need for the
electricity and the project can make a profit, estimated by the
city at $3 million a year.
   In 1985, Klamath Falls applied to the commission for a permit to
build a $117 million, 130-foot-tall dam at Salt Cave, a spot named
for holes in a cliff, that would generate 140 megawatts of
electricity.
   The city even swung a deal that so far has financed planning and
design without costing taxpayers a dime. It sold $250 million worth
of bonds, then reinvested the money at a higher interest rate than
it had to pay on the bonds.
   The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife protested that the
original proposal would flood one of the state's premier trout
streams and rafters said it would dry up a top summer white-water
run.
   The city scaled down the dam in 1986, and tacked on a ski area
to mitigate for the loss of fishing and rafting.
   In 1987, then-Gov. Neil Goldschmidt said Oregon's environment
should be enjoyed by all, not sacrificed to economic development
for one city.
   The state Department of Environmental Quality denied the project
a crucial water quality permit. The state Department of Energy
questioned the need for the power.
   And Reps. Peter DeFazio, Ron Wyden, and Les AuCoin, all
Democrats from western Oregon, across the Cascades from Klamath
Falls, introduced the first bill to grant federal protection to the
river. The bill failed.
   In 1988, the quasi-governmental Northwest Power Planning Council
_ created by Congress to plan for power needs in the Northwest _
included the upper Klamath River among 40,000 miles of Northwest
waterways where it did not want hydroelectric development.
   Oregon voters approved an initiative putting the upper Klamath
on the state scenic waterways list.
   Last year, the federal energy commission suggested doing away
with the dam, and the reservoir, and Klamath Falls agreed.
   The new design would draw water directly from the tailrace of
the J.C. Boyle Dam, carry it 10 miles downstream through canals and
conduits built into the canyon wall, to a powerhouse where it would
spin generators and be returned to the river.
   Michael Hartfield, spokesman for the Salt Caves project, says
the no-dam proposal would improve trout habitat by taking away the
periodic surges of water released from the Boyle dam, leaving a
constant flow.
   But that would mean less water in the river, say opponents, who
also object to the canals and conduits.
   A U.S. Supreme Court decision this year backed the city's claim
that a federal energy commission license would override the state's
opposition.
   In the meantime, DeFazio, Wyden and AuCoin introduced another
bill for federal protection.
   The federal agency has said it will await the bill's fate in
Congress before acting.
   ``It's up to Congress,'' said Orsinger.

<TEXT>
   Iraqi troops are
systematically looting valuable equipment from Kuwait and mining
vital oil, power and water-treatment facilities, a Kuwaiti
resistance leader said Wednesday.
   The Kuwaiti, a former government official, said the organized
destruction of Kuwait City indicates the Iraqis expect to either
withdraw or be driven out of the country they invaded Aug. 2.
   Equipment being taken includes computers, telephones and other
communications supplies, hospital beds and sophisticated medical
equipment, and even window frames, the official said. He declined
to be identified for security reasons.
   Like other Kuwaitis, including government ministers in exile,
the resistance leader said he would welcome an offensive against
the Iraqi occupation forces to drive them out of Kuwait.
   But other Kuwaitis disagree with his assessment of Iraq's
intentions regarding how long it expects to remain in Kuwait, which
has the third-largest oil reserves in the world.
   Some ministers of Kuwait's government-in-exile, based in Taif,
Saudi Arabia, say Iraq has flooded Kuwait with its citizens and may
settle thousands of them there.
   Iraq annexed Kuwait six days after the invasion and last week
the former emirate was declared Iraq's 19th province.
   The resistance leader is an articulate, English-speaking member
of Kuwait's ruling al-Sabah family and an officer in Kuwait's army.
   He was interviewed at his headquarters not far from the Kuwaiti
border. He refused to allow details of his base to be revealed.
   The resistance leader said it was his impression, gleaned from
information he received from guerrillas moving secretly in and out
of Kuwait, that the Iraqis intend to steal what they can from
Kuwait because they know their days are numbered.
   ``They're destroying Kuwait,'' he said. ``All communications
system, all telephones, even traffic lights.''
   Nothing of value is left untouched, he said.
   His comments could not be independently verified. But some
details conform with intelligence reports published elsewhere.
   The resistance leader runs many secret cross-border operations,
smuggling ammunition, supplies and communications equipment into
Kuwait for the resistance.
   But despite Kuwait's well-financed guerrilla campaign of armed
attacks and civil disobedience, the official said ``it's obvious we
can't wage guerrilla warfare for long.'' The newly formed
resistance has an estimated 10,000 men, compared to the estimated
170,000 troops Iraq has in Kuwait, he said.
   The Kuwaitis are trying to show the world they are willing fight
to regain their country, the resistance leader said.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Too-Cheap Asian Sweaters Hurting Domestic Makers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sweaters from Hong Kong, South Korea and
Taiwan that are being sold in the United States at less than fair
market value harm U.S. industry and thus are subject to
anti-dumping duties, the government ruled Wednesday.
   The National Knitwear &amp; Sportswear Association in New York had
filed complaints last September against sweater manufacturers in
the three countries. The sweaters are made predominantly of acrylic
fiber.
   By a 2-1 vote, the International Trade Commission determined the
imports ``materially injure or threaten injury to the U.S.
industry.'' The Commerce Department ruled earlier that the imports
were being sold at less than fair market value.
   Since the Commerce decisions, the Customs Service has been
requiring bonds equal to the amount of anti-dumping duties for the
imports. The bonds now will be converted and actual duties will be
imposed on subsequent imports. The duties are designed to make the
prices of the imported sweaters comparable to those charged for
domestic sweaters.
   Commerce had described the sweaters as knitted or crocheted
outerwear garments, including jackets, vests, cardigans and
pullovers. It said imported sweaters represent 72 percent of the
$1.3 billion U.S. market and the three countries ship 55 percent of
the imports.
   It said the value of sweaters imported from Hong Kong in 1989
was $208.8 million; South Korea, $476.1 million, and Taiwan, $485.5
million.

<HEAD>Gonzalez Proposes Limiting Government Bank Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Banking Committee on
Wednesday proposed limiting the number of accounts that can be
insured by the government and perhaps reducing maximum coverage
below $100,000.
   ``Deposit insurance is at the heart of our financial and
economic stability,'' said Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas. ``We
ignore its problems only with the greatest peril.''
   Gonzalez, in a speech to the House, noted that in the wake of
the failure of the fund that insured deposits in savings and loan
institutions, the bank insurance fund is facing a fifth straight
year of multibillion-dollar losses.
   Despite doubling bank insurance deposit premiums, it will take
as long as five years for the fund to reach a reasonably safe
level, he said.
   Key elements of the plan proposed by Gonzalez would:
   _Limit the number of accounts protected by federal insurance and
consider reducing the $100,000 maximum insurance.
   Under present law, about 99 percent of all deposits are insured
because a wealthy person can use joint and trust accounts to avoid
the $100,000 limit. Gonzalez said the changes also would prevent
abuse of the insurance by pension and other investment funds.
   _Allow regulators to raise assessments for insurance premiums as
the need arises. Institutions that engage in greater risks would
have to pay more for deposit insurance.
   _Toughen capitalization requirements so bank owners would have
more of their own money at risk.
   _Limit permissible investments for insured deposits.
   _Require a parent holding company to share responsibility for
losses incurred by any insured affiliate.
   The 1989 law bailing out depositors in failed S&amp;Ls created one
fund to insure bank deposits, which already is in operation, and a
second to insure S&amp;L deposits starting in 1992.
   Although the law requires the bank fund to have a reserve of at
least $1.25 for each $100 of covered deposits, huge losses have
reduced the actual reserve ratio to about 60 cents per $100,
Gonzalez said.

   More Westerners who had been stranded in Iraq flew home to
freedom today, and Baghdad insisted it was speeding the departure
of those who remain behind. Britain pledged funds for a U.S.-led
effort to help nations suffering from U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
   In his latest televised message, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
said children in Iraq are dying because of the U.N. embargo.
   ``The children in Iraq are dying because of a foolish decision
taken by certain people, the children of Iraq are dying because
they are being deprived of their food and milk and medicine,''
Saddam said in a statement read by an announcer.
   He also sounded a defiant note, urging Arabs to rise up and
overthrow leaders in countries aligned against him. He singled out
Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
   The British commitment of funds was made today to Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, one of two U.S. officials on
international tours. The trips are also aimed at raising funds for
the American force sent to defend Saudi Arabia.
   U.S. military officials said today the United States is using
night convoys to move heavy firepower into the northern Saudi
desert. The moves increase the offensive capabilities of U.S.
forces, though officials have said the buildup is designed to
defend the Saudis against any Iraqi attack.
   Also today, U.S. forces released a freighter they had seized in
the Gulf of Oman a day earlier. The Iraqi-flagged freighter was
carrying Sri Lankan tea and apparently was bound for Iraq in
violation of the U.N. embargo. A Navy spokesman said the ship was
allowed to proceed to an unspecified port after a 30-hour search.
   Though hundreds of Westerners were allowed to leave Baghdad
Tuesday and today, Iraqi red tape kept many others waiting. Despite
Iraqi promises to expedite departures, British officials said Iraq
had intercepted 30 British women and children trying to join a
convoy leaving Kuwait.
   Jordan's King Hussein traveled to Baghdad to try to keep
diplomatic efforts alive. He was to hold talks with Saddam today or
Thursday.
   In Moscow, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz met Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to discuss the gulf crisis.
   The trip came a day after Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze proposed an international conference on the Persian
Gulf crisis. President Bush and Gorbachev are to hold a summit
Sunday in Helsinki, Finland.
   In other diplomatic efforts, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III was headed today for the Middle East, West Germany and Italy.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady met in London with Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.
   Mrs. Thatcher promised to contribute to a U.S.-organized fund to
help nations worst hit by U.N.-ordered sanctions on Iraq, British
officials said. A Thatcher spokeswoman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, reported the prime minister ``said the United Kingdom
would certainly contribute ... and would let the United States have
detailed figures as soon as possible.''
   Brady and Baker are also seeking financial commitments to help
ease the burden of maintaining a U.S. expeditionary force in Saudi
Arabia as part of the international effort to pressure Saddam into
withdrawing from Kuwait.
   Baker said Tuesday that the Bush administration envisions
maintaining a military presence in the Persian Gulf even if Iraq
leaves oil-rich Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2. He said the United
States is considering creating a NATO-type alliance to deal with
future security threats in the region.
   Meanwhile, the airlift of Westerners from Iraq, mostly women and
children, continued today.
   Seven British and four American women arrived in Amman on the
regular morning Iraqi Airways flight from Baghdad. And a
French-chartered Iraqi Airways jetliner also arrived in Amman with
105 Western women and children, including 10 Americans.
   In addition, a Virgin Atlantic Airways flight with 25 U.S.
hostages from Baghdad was headed for Newark, N.J., later this
afternoon. The Americans traveled via Amman and London.
   The Iraqi News Agency today quoted an unidentified government
spokesman as saying Iraq was doing its best to speed the departure
of foreign women and children.
   ``Iraq endeavors with all possible means to ensure their
departure in cooperation with concerned countries,'' the news
agency reported. It said ``all border points were open for their
departure, and the Iraqi Airways was ready to lease its aircraft
for flying them to any capital.''
   Iraq had slowed the release process by denying foreign jets
landing rights and by forcing Westerners to deal with visa red tape.
   Saddam has said women and children can leave, but foreign men
are being kept behind as human shields against any U.S. attack on
strategic sites.
   In Baghdad, 306 British women and children who arrived in a
seven-bus convoy from Kuwait on Tuesday night were awaiting exit
visas today, diplomats said on condition of anonymity. The group
was expected to leave Baghdad on Thursday or Friday.
   However, Iraqis intercepted 30 British women and children trying
to join the convoy Tuesday as it left Kuwait, the Foreign Office
said today. They were being detained in a hotel, the officials
said. They gave no further details.
   About 11,000 Westerners were believed still stranded in Kuwait
and Iraq.
   In addition, tens of thousands of Asian refugees are stranded in
Jordan with no way to get home. Many have gathered in desert camps,
where food and water are scarce and sanitary facilities almost
non-existent.
   On Tuesday at one of the camps, thousands of refugees pushed and
scuffled next to a truck from which Jordanian officials distributed
rations _ a round piece of flat Arab bread, one tomato and one
small cucumber per person.
   Jordanian soldiers on duty stripped off their belts and started
flailing the ragged refugees, yelling at them to stop fighting and
get into line.
   At a news conference in Amman, Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan
criticized the lack of attention given to the refugees and appealed
for help. International relief organizations also called for more
aid.
   Most of the more than 100,000 refugees stranded in Jordan are
from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and
Thailand.
   Baker, testifying Tuesday before the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, discussed ways the United States might confront future
security challenges in the Persian Gulf and suggested an alliance
like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``I think we will have to give consideration to working with
others to create a new security structure for the region,'' Baker
said. ``I think that's likely to be required even if there is a
pullback (by Iraq) from Kuwait.
   The White House announced Tuesday that Bush had decided to ask
Congress to forgive Egypt's entire $7 billion military debt in
appreciation for President Hosni Mubarak's role in standing up to
Iraqi aggression.

   Forty-eight drug traffickers, most of
them Afghans, were hanged Wednesday in the northeastern Iranian
city of Mashhad, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   Some of those executed were charged with possessing as little as
31 grams of heroin, IRNA said. The agency, monitored in Nicosia,
did not specify how many of those executed were Afghans.
   Iranian officials blame neighboring Afghanistan and Pakistan for
the drug problem in their country. About a million of Iran's 55
million people are involved in drug abuse, according to official
Iranian estimates. Other sources put the number at twice that.
   The state-run Iranian media have reported more than 1,500
drug-related executions since December 1988. Iranian law stipulates
the death sentence for possession of even small quantities of
illicit drugs with intent to sell.

   The U.S. military Wednesday canceled
all off-post liberty for troops at the six American bases here,
citing possible danger in advance of U.S.-Philippine talks on the
future of the bases.
   Military spokesman Lt. Col. Ron Rand said the move was taken
because of ``several indications'' of an increased threat against
the 40,000 troops, Defense Department civilians and dependents in
the Philippines. He did not elaborate.
   In May, Communist rebels killed two American airmen at Clark Air
Base, 50 miles north of Manila, on the eve of talks on the bases'
future.
   The United States operates six military bases in the Philippines
under an agreement expiring in September 1991. The talks, expected
to resume early next week, are aimed at forging a new lease.
   A growing number of Filipinos oppose the bases, saying they are
an infringment on national sovereignty. The rebel New Peoples Army
has vowed to kill more Americans until all U.S. troops leave the
country.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors should encourage their patients to write
down their wishes about whether they want life-sustaining treatment
stopped if they become hopelessly ill, according to a group medical
ethicists.
   The ``living wills'' spell out what kind of care people want if
they become too sick to speak for themselves. Such directives are
required in two states _ New York and Missouri _ before food, water
and medical treatment can be withdrawn.
   In June, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Missouri's guidelines,
writing that states can require ``clear and convincing evidence''
of a patient's wishes.
   The patient in that case, Nancy Cruzan, had been in a vegetative
state since a 1983 car accident. Her parents believed she would not
want to be kept alive in such a condition and sought to have her
tube feeding stopped. However, she had not made a living will, and
the court refused to allow her parents to speak for her.
   A statement on the case was drawn up at the Annual Conference of
Bioethicists in Lutsen, Minn., in July, signed by 36 ethicists and
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   Besides urging doctors to learn what their patients' want, they
wrote that physicians ``should also encourage patients to discuss
their preferences with their families and close friends and to
prepare and sign advance directives.''
   Even though unnecessary in most states, such statements ``often
help to resolve legally and ethically troubling cases,'' they noted.
   They added that the Supreme Court decision does not change the
laws, ethical standards and medical practices that have evolved
since the Karen Ann Quinlan case in 1976.

   President Bush today told lawmakers just back
from the Persian Gulf that the sanctions against Iraq must succeed
or ``we will review our options.''
   Bush also placed a morale-boosting call to U.S. Ambassador
Nathaniel Howell at the besieged U.S. Embassy in Kuwait City, where
a skeleton staff of diplomats has stayed behind to assist Americans
trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush heard
``repeated statements of support to see this mission through'' from
the more than 30 representatives and senators who attended the
session in the State Dining Room.
   Fitzwater praised the Soviet Union's role in the international
effort to isolate Iraq, and said the United States is now ``even
more interested'' in helping Mikhail Gorbachev's faltering economy.
   He quoted Bush as telling the lawmakers, ``We must keep pressure
on Iraq and convince Saddam Hussein that time is against him.''
   ``The president said, `The sanctions must succeed. If not, we
will review our options,''' said Fitzwater. He would not elaborate.
   On today's statement by the Iraqi president in Baghdad that
``the children of Iraq are dying'' because of the United Nations
embargo, Fitzwater said, ``We have no evidence to that effect.''
   He dismissed the Iraqi president remarks as ``another rhetorical
diatribe'' intended to split Arab unity, and ``a sign of
desperation.''
   ``For Saddam Hussein to claim moral rectitude is totally beyond
belief,'' the spokesman said.
   The Iraqis have cut off water and electricity to the U.S.
Embassy as part of their drive to shut down all foreign embassies
in the land they annexed following an Aug. 2 lightning invasion.
   Fitzwater said Howell ``is struggling in a very difficult
situation.''
   Earlier, Sen. John Glenn suggested that the U.S. troops
stationed in the Saudi Arabian desert be given pay and income tax
incentives ``to forestall a morale problem.''
   Glenn, who was part of a congressional delegation just back from
th Middle East, said he told Bush such benefits as free postage
stamps, ``imminent danger'' pay, and exemption from income tax
should be arranged for U.S. troops on duty in Saudi Arabia.
   ``I just want to forestall a morale problem'' among the soldiers
who have no idea how long they will be stationed in the bleak, hot
desert where there are few comforts, Glenn, D-Ohio, said following
the White House meeting.
   Glenn also suggested the sea blockade should be extended to
impede air cargo to Iraq by imposing sanctions against countries
where the planes originate.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said Bush should push Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to pull remaining Soviet military
and technical advisers out of Iraq. He said Bush should not accept
the ``figleaf excuse'' that the advisers are there on unexpired
contracts.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said he urged Bush to press the
Soviets for military intelligence material they could provide on
the Iraqi military capability.
   The lawmakers also said they had received strong assurances from
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and Egypt's Presdient Hosni Mubarak that
the economic sanctions against Saudi Arabia's Saddam Hussein can
work if given enough time.
   However, some of the Kuwaitis who fled their country when Iraq
invaded it Aug. 2 are more ``trigger happy,''said House Republican
leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.
   Some other members of the congressional delegation have
suggested U.S. reserve combat units should be sent to Saudi Arabia
to provide a critical test of the forces' capabilities.
   ``We want to see ... how good the combat units are,'' Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said
at a news conference Tuesday. ``This is a test for the future.''
   Rep. Bill Dickinson of Alabama, the ranking Republican on
Aspin's panel, said he regretted the Pentagon's decision not to
activate National Guard combat units, which comprise one-third of
the combat power of the active Army divisions being sent to the
Persian Gulf.
   Another senior member of the Armed Services Committee, Rep. G.V.
``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., said the current situation provides
an ideal opportunity for evaluating the reserves.
   ``There's no shooting war. Let's find out if you can mobilize
and see how many will show up,'' said Montgomery, who toured
Bahrain, Egypt and Saudi Arabia in the House delegation.
   The more than 9,000 reservists called to active duty following
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last month have been largely confined to
support roles, backing up active-duty combat forces in the gulf
area. More than 100,000 U.S. servicemen and women are serving on
land or sea in the region.
   ``There's concern that we're putting all this money into combat
reserves and yet they're not being called up,'' said Cohen.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams declined to say what
recommendations are before Defense Secretary Dick Cheney about
increasing the reservists' role. He said there has been ``a lot of
discussion about what might happen down the road,'' but no decision
has been made.

<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS three grafs after 2nd to UPDATE with Jemison telling
convention today that he supports Bush's decision to send troops.
Picks up 3rd graf, `Most religious...'</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Most of America's largest church
organizations, cautious since the Vietnam War about supporting U.S.
military involvement, are not sure how to respond to the buildup in
the Persian Gulf.
   The Rev. T.J. Jemison, president of the National Baptist
Convention U.S.A., broke with other U.S. religious leaders during
the church's annual meeting this week when he criticized the
deployment. But the gathering as a whole has not yet spoken.
   And in an apparent policy change today, Jemison told the
convention he supports President Bush's decision to send troops to
the Middle East.
   ``As true Americans, we owe allegiance to the Stars and Stripes
forever,'' Jemison said. ``We are loyal and devoted citizens.''
   He had ``America the Beautiful'' played for the convention and
he recited the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Most religious bodies condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait but
are trying to figure out how to balance their opposition to Saddam
Hussein with concern the U.S. response may be motivated more by oil
than by humanitarianism, said Dale Bishop, director of the Middle
East office of the National Council of Churches.
   ``I think the caution reflects different opinions, which means
no one is feeling empowered to speak on behalf of the church on
this issue,'' Bishop said Tuesday.
   The executive committee of the council, the nation's largest
ecumenical body, was scheduled to meet Sept. 12 to discuss the
Persian Gulf.
   The Baptist convention was expected to vote Thursday at its
110th annual meeting here on a resolution attacking the troop
deployment.
   The convention is the nation's third-largest Protestant
denomination with 7.8 million members and considers itself the
largest organization of blacks in the world.
   ``There is a moral issue,'' Jemison said. ``It's over oil. We're
jeopardizing our fine young men and women over oil in the Persian
Gulf.''
   Jemison said Tuesday that with pressing social needs in this
country, ``It's really unfortunate to spend a billion dollars a
month over oil.''
   Other religious groups also have spoken out on the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Following a meeting with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Aug.
24, 11 leaders from a broad range of American Jewish organizations
issued a statement supporting President Bush's ``policies and
actions in addressing Iraq's aggression.''
   Robert K. Lifton, president of the American Jewish Congress,
said that Hussein would have entered Saudi Arabia unless Bush acted
and that the Iraqi leader is intent on trying to hold the world
hostage.
   ``My view is the president did the only thing he could do at
this time,'' he said.
   Other U.S. church leaders have been reluctant to take a stand.
   ``I think some part of our people were so burned in the Vietnam
experience ... before they make a commitment to something like
this, they want to be surer than sure,'' Lifton said.
   The Rev. Paul H. Sherry, president of the 1.6 million-member
United Church of Christ, and the Rev. John O. Humbert, president of
the 1.1 million-member Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), said
in a joint letter to Bush last week that restraint is essential in
working toward a negotiated peace.
   The American Friends Service Committee, an independent Quaker
organization in Philadelphia, called on Tuesday for a halt to the
U.S. buildup, saying American troops should be replaced by an Arab
or U.N. peacekeeping force.
   Still, most of the nation's large church organizations have
avoided judging Bush's decision to send U.S. troops to defend Saudi
Arabia and try to force Iraq out of Kuwait.
   In the 53 million-member Roman Catholic Church, Archbishop
Daniel Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, president of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, said only that he was praying for a
peaceful solution so ``that the soldiers, sailors and air men of
all forces now arrayed in the region may soon be restored to their
families.''
   Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning of the 2.5 million-member
Episcopal Church, of which Bush is a member, urged the president
not to allow national pride to obstruct negotiations.

<HEAD>Magistrate Denies Complaint Against Mapplethorpe Exhibit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of the Robert Mapplethorpe photo exhibit
lost a bid in court Wednesday to halt the show they say violates
obscenity laws.
   Boston Municipal Clerk Magistrate Rosemary Carr denied three
complaints against the exhibit, which would have prompted an
investigation by the district attorney.
   Carr said ``personally I wouldn't pay five cents'' for the
pictures, but she moved quickly to deny the request by the American
Family Association.
   The group had sought a ruling that the exhibit _ which includes
nude photos of children _ is exploitative, constitutes
dissemination of obscene materials and dissemination of matter
harmful to minors.
   Lesley Pasquini, who filed the complaints against the Institute
of Contemporary Art, said members of her group will discuss their
next step. ``We're going to keep making people aware of what's
going on and what's being pushed before the public,'' she said.
   But museum attorney Cassandra Warshowsky said the exhibit is
protected.
   ``There is an exemption in the obscenity statutes for
exhibitions in a bona fide museum, school or library,'' Warshowsky
said. ``In addition to that, this exhibit is fully protected under
the Constitution _ the First Amendment.''
   The Mapplethorpe photos first went on display at the museum five
weeks ago.
   Seven photographs, including one of a nude boy and another of a
partially nude girl, were the subject of the complaint. Opponents
objected to the juxtaposition of pictures of nude children next to
pictures of nude men.
   ``They're the most bizarre, perverted photos I have ever seen,''
said Evelyn Dubel of Morality in Media.
   In Cincinnati, the Contemporary Arts Center and its director
were charged with a misdemeanor count of pandering obscenity for
displaying homoerotic pictures in the exhibit, which also includes
portraits and still lifes of flowers.
   Outrage over the photos contributed to restrictions on federal
funding for the arts.
   Mapplethorpe died last year at age 42 of AIDS.

   President Bush is putting off for a week a
political trip to Colorado and California due to his weekend summit
with Mikhail Gorbachev and ongoing budget negotiations with
Congress, the White House said Wednesday.
   Bush, who had planned to make the western swing next Tuesday and
Wednesday, instead will go to Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco
on Sept. 18-19.
   He will help raise funds for Rep. Hank Brown, the Republican
candidate for senator in Colorado, and for Sen. Pete Wilson, the
GOP gubernatorial candidate in California, in Los Angeles and San
Francisco.
   Bush was proceeding with a planned political trip Thursday to
Topeka, Kan., and Tallahassee, Fla., for Republican governors in
those states.
   He departs Friday for Helsinki, Finland, and the hastily
scheduled summit there on Sunday with the Soviet president.
   In his absence, White House and congressional budget negotiators
are spending the weekend at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland in
talks aimed at producing a deficit-reduction accord.

   The White House did not announce the topic of the Tuesday night
speech, but it was expected to cover the crisis in the Persian
Gulf. It will follow Bush's weekend trip to Helsinki to meet with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``The president expressed an interst in addressing the Congress
in conversations today with Speaker of the House Thomas Foley and
Majority Leader of the Senate George Mitchell,'' Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said in a written announcement of the speech.
   Bush was to have made a political trip to California and Denver

but the White House announced today that that trip had been
postponed.

<HEAD>Call Girl Placed at Party With Thrift Executives One Day Before
Her Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former call girl was slain within a day after
she went to a party thrown in 1985 by officials of the since-failed
Vernon Savings &amp; Loan of Texas, according to court documents.
   The lavish all-night party allegedly was paid for with $10,000
in bank funds. Vernon Savings officials spent more than $500,000 on
rent for the house during a three-year period in the mid-1980s,
according to court documents.
   A former call girl who has been questioned by homicide
detectives told the The San Diego Union that Donna Gentile, 22, was
present at the June 21, 1985, party at a northern San Diego County
beach house.
   Gentile also was a sometime police informant.
   Her nude body was found at dawn on June 23. The coroner
estimated she had been dead 10 to 15 hours before she was found off
a rural highway eastern San Diego County. Gravel had been stuffed
in her mouth, the newspaper reported.
   ``If the date (of the party) is close to that _ and we know
Donna was a talker _ if that is what was happening, there could be
all sorts of motives (for her death) other than what we are looking
at now,'' a law enforcement source told the Union.
   Shortly before her slaying, Gentile had testified at a city
Civil Service Commission hearing about alleged misconduct by some
officers.
   Assistant Police Chief Norm Stamper has been working with the
San Diego Metropolitan Homicide Task Force in its search for links
among the slayings of Gentile and 42 other women, mostly
prostitutes. Their bodies have been found in remote parts of San
Diego County since 1985.
   The former call girl has been interviewed repeatedly by
detectives, but had not mentioned seeing Gentile at that party. Her
statements are the first disclosure of Gentile's presumed
whereabouts immediately before her slaying, the newspaper said
Wednesday.
   ``If that is the date (of the party), then it is of
importance,'' Chief Deputy District Attorney Brian Michaels said.
   The former call girl characterized the financiers as frequent
customers of Karen Wilkening, who is serving a prison sentence for
operating a San Diego-area call girl ring.
   ``I knew that (Vernon) gang really well,'' she said. ``They
spent a lot of money and had a lot of parties on yachts.''
   Don R. Dixon, a former Del Mar resident who headed the Vernon
institution, is accused of spending several hundred thousand
dollars of Vernon funds on prostitutes, hunting trips, political
contributions, yacht trips, antique cars and the beach house.
   He faces an Oct. 15 trial in Dallas.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised by anything coming up, so I wouldn't
want to foreclose anything, but I don't want to suggest that the
prosecution would attempt to make this part of the case'' against
Dixon in Dallas, U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins said in Dallas.

<HEAD>Poll Shows Perpich Leading Primary Foes in Minnesota</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A late August poll gave Democratic Gov. Rudy
Perpich, who has been dogged by low public approval ratings, a
strong lead over his closest competitor in next week's primary,
according to results released Wednesday.
   The copyright Pioneer Press-WCCO poll showed Perpich leading
challenger Mike Hatch 52 percent to 35 percent among likely voters
in Tuesday's Democratic-Farmer-Labor primary. Twelve percent were
undecided and 1 percent favored other candidates.
   State Auditor Arne Carlson led Jon Grunseth 39 percent to 21
percent among likely voters in the Independent-Republican primary,
with Doug Kelley supported by 15 percent. Twenty-three percent were
undecided and 2 percent favored other candidates, according to the
survey.
   The poll, conducted Aug. 23-30, surveyed a random sample of 705
likely primary voters. The margin of error was plus or minus 4
percentage points.
   For the governor, the results represented a surge in support
since a Pioneer Press-WCCO Poll in July. The earlier survey showed
Perpich trailing Hatch by a 33 percent to 29 percent margin, with
36 percent undecided.
   The latest poll came on the heels of an intensive television
advertising campaign by Perpich in which the governor claimed he
has made Minnesota a national leader.
   Carlson's strong showing in the survey represented an apparent
failure by party leaders to derail his campaign and rescue
Grunseth, a St. Paul businessman who is the party's endorsed
candidate.

<HEAD>McConnell Calls Out Bloodhounds Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell has
called out a familiar pair of bloodhounds to track down votes in
his campaign for re-election this year.
   The dogs, which appear in one of McConnell's new television
spots, are the same ones that were given some credit for his 1984
ouster of Democratic incumbent Walter ``Dee'' Huddleston. In the
original ads, the bloodhounds were dispatched to search for
Huddleston at resorts where he was paid to give speeches while the
Senate was in session.
   This time, McConnell is using the hounds to send the message
that he will be in Washington to vote on issues of concern to
Kentuckians.
   ``Remember that ad?'' McConnell asks in the new spot, which
first aired Tuesday. ``It was funny. But the point was dead
serious. In the last campaign, I made a commitment to the people of
Kentucky. I said I wouldn't miss a single vote to collect a
speaking fee, and I've kept that pledge.''
   McConnell does collect fees for making speeches, and has opposed
efforts to prohibit such fees, saying a ban on that form of income
would be unfair because many senators own property that generates
outside income.
   In the ad, McConnell tells viewers his six-year
voting-attendance record is 99 percent, ``one of the best in the
entire Senate. Being on the job is the most important thing a
senator has to do.''
   The ad doesn't mention his current Democratic opponent, former
Louisville mayor and Jefferson County judge-executive Harvey Sloane.

<HEAD>Iowa Governor Candidates Launch Television Campaigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iowa's rivals for governor launched
their fall television blitz with mild commercials focusing on
family and their records.
   GOP Gov. Terry Branstad on Tuesday began airing a 30-second spot
boosting his role in developing the state's economy.
   His Democratic challenger, Don Avenson, began his drive last
week with one commercial introducing voters to his family and
another featuring Avenson talking about his efforts to push clean
water legislation.
   Branstad campaign manager David Roederer said the television
spots build on radio commercials the campaign began last month
underscoring Branstad's efforts to manage the state during the
economic turmoil of the 1980s.
   ``They'll start folding in some testimonials on economic
development,'' said Roederer.
   House Speaker Avenson's commercials are designed to soften his
image by playing on his family and connection to popular
environmental programs, said spokeswoman Susy Robinette.
   Both camps insisted they were staying away from hard-hitting
negative commercials. The governor's race is generally considered
competitive, though Branstad has built a big edge in campaign
finances.

<HEAD>Administration: Women Soldiers May Have to Live with Saudi Culture</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Gulf, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American women who are part of the military
buildup in Saudi Arabia may have to get used to cultural
differences that put them in a subservient role, the White House
said Wednesday.
   ``It is something our military is grappling with,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, describing it as ``just one of
many similar kinds of cultural situations that our service men and
women are running into there.''
   The Saudi expect female soldiers to conform to such cultural
practices as not allowing women to shop alone. The culture bars
socializing or having personal contact _ even for business _ with a
member of the opposite sex who is not a relative.
   The Pentagon did get a special exemption from the Saudi
government to allow women to drive trucks, forklifts and other
vital equipment. Saudi women are not allowed to drive.
   When shopping, female soldiers must be accompanied by a male who
makes the purchases while the woman stands with her eyes downcast
to avoid offending the male shopkeeper.
   ``We are working on it,'' Fitzwater said when asked whether the
administration was trying to remedy the situation. ``Our commanders
are working with the Saudis and trying to develop new programs and
processes for living there that can accommodate both cultures.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An extract from pokeweed plants can hamper
reproduction of the AIDS virus within infected cells, suggesting a
possible new approach to treating infected people, researchers say.
   In test-tube experiments, the extract worked in tiny amounts
that did not disturb key functions in uninfected cells, researchers
said.
   The work is reported in Thursday's issue of the British journal
Nature by scientists from Oncogen in Seattle, the Veterans
Administration Medical Center in San Diego and the University of
Minnesota in Minneapolis.
   Pokeweed contains clusters of purplish-white flowers and
reddish-purple berries. It grows in North America, and its roots
and berry seeds are poisonous.
   Researchers purified a substance called pokeweed antiviral
protein from the leaves of the plant.
   They mixed it with proteins called monoclonal antibodies, which
targeted the dose to cells infected by the virus that causes
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   This mixture, called a conjugate, strongly inhibited
reproduction of the AIDS virus in blood cells called T cells from
infected patients, researchers said.

   Three radical leftists will plead guilty to
setting off bombs at the U.S. Capitol and seven other sites, and
the government has agreed to drop charges against three other
people.
   Laura J. Whitehorn, Linda S. Evans and Marilyn J. Buck are
scheduled to plead guilty Friday in U.S. District Court here to
participating in a conspiracy to set off the eight bombs that
damaged property but caused no injuries, according to court papers
filed last week in federal court.
   The Nov. 7, 1983, blast at the Capitol blew a hole in a wall
outside the Senate chambers, damaging five paintings and knocking
the door to Democratic leader Robert Byrd's office off its hinges.
   As part of the deal, government prosecutors agreed to drop
bombing charges against three other members of the leftist group
who are serving lengthy prison sentences for possession of
explosives.
   The six defendants are members of a radical group that variously
identified itself as the Armed Resistance Unit, the Revolutionary
Fighting Group and the Red Guerrilla Resistance unit.
   The group is linked to the $1.6 million armed robbery of a
Brinks armored car near Nyack, N.Y., in 1981 in which two policemen
and a guard were killed. Buck is serving a 50-year sentence for
participating in the Brinks holdup and four other armed robberies.
   The plea agreement filed by U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens said
the disposition of the bombing case was ``in the interest of
justice'' but gave no reason for why the government agreed to
settle the case.
   Lawyers familiar with the case said a May Supreme Court decision
in a New York case on the issue of double jeopardy figured in the
government's willingness to drop the charges against Susan L.
Rosenberg, Timothy A. Blunk and Alan Berkman.
   Rosenberg and Blunk are serving 58-year sentences for possessing
more than 600 pounds of explosives. They were caught loading the
explosives into a rented storage bin in Cherry Hill, N.J., in 1984.
   Berkman, a physician, is serving a 10-year term for possession
of explosives, weapons and false identify cards when he was
arrested in 1985 in Doylestown, Pa.
   A seventh defendant in the case, Elizabeth Duke, is a fugitive.
   In 1989, U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene dismissed the
bombing charges against Rosenberg, Blunk and Berkman, ruling that
the evidence in the case had already been used to convict them of
the earlier firearms charges.
   The U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
reinstated the charges, saying the new indictment did not violate
the rules against double jeopardy.
   But the defense renewed its double-jeopardy claims last spring
after the Supreme Court said in a New York case that prosecutors
cannot bring charges based on evidence that had already been used
to convict the defendant of a different offense.
   Greene has not ruled on that motion.
   Whitehorn, 45, Buck, 43, and Evans, 43, agreed to plead guilty
to conspiracy, and destruction of government property. Each could
be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison.
   Whitehorn also agreed to plead guilty to fraud in connection
with possession of false identification documents that the FBI
found during a 1985 raid on her Baltimore apartment. The charge
carries a five-year prison term.
   Prosecutors agreed to drop other Baltimore charges against
Whitehorn.
   In addition to the explosion at the Capitol, bombs were
detonated outside the National War College at Fort McNair here
April 26, 1983, the Washington Navy Yard Computer Center on Aug.
18, 1983, and the Washington Navy Yard Officers Club on April 20,
1984.
   Bombs were also placed at the FBI's office on Staten Island,
N.Y., on Jan. 28, 1983, the Israeli Aircraft Industries Building in
New York on April 5, 1984, the South African consulate in New York
on Sept. 26, 1984, and the New York Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association on Feb. 23, 1985.

   Twenty-four Americans held hostage in the
Persian Gulf arrived in the United States on Wednesday, weary from
a 20-hour flight but thrilled to be back.
   ``I'm happy to be home,'' said Taleb Subh, 15, of Davenport,
Iowa, who had been visiting aunts and uncles in Kuwait when Iraq
invaded the country Aug. 2.
   He said he went to the U.S. Embassy, where officials ``snuck''
him to Baghdad.
   ``They took care of me,'' said Taleb, who was among five men,
nine women and 10 children who flew home aboard a Virgin Atlantic
Airways Boeing 747.
   The group was among 29 Americans who began the journey to
freedom in Jordan on Tuesday, said Lori Levin, an airline
spokeswoman. She said she did not know why five of the Americans
decided to stop in London rather than make the flight to the Newark.
   Norik Checkosky of Middletown, came to the airport to meet her
mother, Zaroohi Babooriam, who had been in Iraq visiting relatives.
   ``Right now, she seems physically ill. She looks very bad,'' Ms.
Checkosky said.
   She said she learned in a telephone call from her mother Tuesday
that the freedom plane would arrive Wednesday.
   ``She said she was just fine, tired but fine,'' Ms. Checkosky
said.
   The Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 landed about 3:20 p.m. at Newark
International Airport, and passengers were expected to spend at
least an hour passing through U.S. Customs before they could leave
the airport or catch connecting flights.
   ``We welcome these people home,'' Lucinda Florio, wife of Gov.
Jim Florio, said in presenting yellow roses to Nithal George, who
was traveling from Iraq with her three children ages 11, 7 and 2 en
route to San Jose, Calif.
   Representatives of the American Red Cross met the former
hostages at the airport to smooth their return.
   ``We'll make flight arrangements,'' said Jane Frotton, director
of emergency services for the Red Cross' Essex County chapter.
   The Americans, who were among 11,000 Westerners believed to be
stranded in Kuwait and Iraq, traveled through Amman, Jordan, and to
London before arriving in Newark.
   The plane, loaded with medical supplies and food, had flown to
Jordan on Monday and had clearance to land in Baghdad, but was
unable to do so because such supplies would have violated the trade
embargo against Iraq, Ms. Levin said. The supplies, 2{ tons of
flour, 25,000 blankets, and 2{ tons of medical supplies, were
requested by Jordan's King Hussein.
   The hostages, freed by Iraq, made their way to Jordan for the
flight home.
   Though hundreds of Westerners were allowed to leave Baghdad on
Tuesday and Wednesday, Iraqi red tape kept many others waiting.
   The Iraqi News Agency on Wednesday quoted an unidentified
government spokesman as saying Iraq was trying to speed the
departure of foreign women and children.
   The news agency said ``all border points were open for their
departure, and the Iraqi Airways was ready to lease its aircraft
for flying them to any capital.''
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said women and children can
leave, but foreign men are being kept behind as human shields
against any U.S. attack on strategic sites.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Secretary of the
Treasury Nicholas Brady are on the road in search of aid, financial
and humane, for the Persian Gulf operation.
   Brady has been to France and Britain and is continuing to the
Far East for meetings with Korean and Japanese leaders. Baker will
meet with Italian, West German and Soviet leaders next week.
   Here is a look at the countries they will visit, with the amount
of oil each consumes, imports from the Persian Gulf, and
contributions thus far. Daily consumption and net imports from
Persian Gulf is in millions of barrels per day.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Consumption: 1,737.
   Britain is a net exporter of oil but also imports 10,248,000
barrels a year, mainly from Norway and Iran. A little comes from
Kuwait and almost nothing from Iraq.
   Britain has sent 2,000 military personnel to Saudi Arabia, Oman
and the Gulf states.
   Three squadrons of warplanes are divided between Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain and Oman. There is a reconnaissance aircraft unit, an
anti-aircraft missile unit, a field ambulance and field hospital,
four warships _ two destroyers and two frigates _ and five support
ships. Three minesweepers are heading for the eastern Mediterranean.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FRANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Consumption: 1,856. Persian Gulf import total: .863.
   Defense officials said Wednesday that France has deployed 8,950
military personnel in the Gulf, the second largest force after the
United States. Nine French navy ships are in the region, or en
route, including the aircraft carrier Clemenceau. One company of
180 paratroopers has been sent to the United Arab Emirates.
   Non-lethal government aid includes about $220 million for Jordan
to help resettle refugees. The private group Medecins Sans
Frontiers has sent 12 tons of medical equipment to Jordan for the
same purpose.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WEST GERMANY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Consumption: 2,278; Persian Gulf import total .233.
   West Germany has sent tents and medical supplies to Jordan to
help refugees. Several West German planes ferried refugees from
Jordan to Cairo early in the crisis.
   Seven West German minesweepers are on their way to the eastern
Mediterrean as reinforcement for U.S. ships being deployed to the
Gulf.

<HEAD>ITALY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Consumption 1,940; Persian Gulf import total: .657.
   Italy has sent two frigates and a support ship to the Gulf. Two
corvettes are in the eastern Mediterranean off the coast of Turkey.

<HEAD>JAPAN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Consumption: 4,981; Persian Gulf import total: 3.450.
   Japan has loaded a ship with 800 four-wheel-drive vehicles for
the U.S.-led multinational force in the Persian Gulf. The $11
million in cargo also included an unspecified number of water
trucks and air conditioners.
   The shipment is part of the assistance package announced last
week by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. It is to include 100 medical
personnel and chartered civil aircraft and ships that will
transport food, water and medical supplies as well as other
non-military goods.

<HEAD>Another Panamanian Police Chief Fired</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fourth person to head Panama's
national police since the U.S. invasion in December has been fired
after writing a letter to a newspaper in response to corruption
allegations.
   Lt. Col. Fernando Quezada was replaced provisionally by Ebrahim
Asvat, who becomes the first civilian in 40 years to head Panama's
security forces. Asvat also is the public security director for the
Interior and Justice Department.
   ``The president ... has separated Lt. Col. Fernando Quezada from
his post as director-general of the Public Force because of an
absolutely unacceptable public letter,'' said a communique issued
late Tuesday by President Guillermo Endara's office.
   Quezada was fired after he sent a letter to La Prensa publisher
Roberto Eisenmann and fax copies to news organizations protesting a
story published Tuesday.
   According to the story, the former head of the Anti-Terrorist
Unit, Ramon Diaz, said Quezada received $25,000 from ousted
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega but later tried to depose the
strongman.
   Quezada's letter recalled Noriega's charges of gross personal
misconduct against Eisenmann.
   Asvat said Wednesday that Quezada will remain on the police
force at his present rank but without specific duties.
   The Public Force replaces the Panama Defense Forces, which were
headed by Noriega.
   Although many current officers are former Defense Forces
personnel, the new department was converted to a civilian force and
placed under the Interior Ministry after Noriega was driven from
power during the U.S. invasion.
   Asvat told The Associated Press on Wednesday that from now on
the civilian force will accept cadets only from police academies,
not military schools.
   After Noriega was taken to Miami to face U.S. drug-trafficking
charges, Col. Roberto Armijo took over the Public Force but was
replaced when a bank account of more than $1 million was found in
his name.
   A deputy, Aristides Valdonedo, took the job but was fired when
he was linked to the arson of a building of which Eisenmann was
part owner.
   He was replaced by Col. Eduardo Herrera Hassan, who retired Aug.
22. Quezada was named to the post after four civilians turned it
down.

   Tropical Storm Isidore formed off the Cape Verde
Islands on Wednesday, but presented no immediate threat to land,
forecasters said.
   Isidore, the ninth named storm of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane
season, generated winds of 40 mph and was expected to strengthen
somewhat by Thursday, said National Hurricane Center forecaster Bob
Ebaugh.
   At noon EDT Wednesday, the storm's center was located near
latitude 9.9 north and longitude 34.8 west, or about 750 miles
southwest of the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Africa.
   Isidore was moving toward the west at 18 mph and that motion was
expected to continue at least through Thursday.
   Storms are named when their maximum sustained winds reach 39
mph. If Isidore's winds exceed 74 mph, it would become the fourth
hurricane of the season. So far, the only hurricane to reach land
was Diana, which hit the Mexican coast.

   Leaders of last fall's peaceful revolution
occupied the former secret police headquarters Wednesday in a
struggle over control of millions of files collected by the force.
   ``Herr Mielke, where are my files?'' read a message
spray-painted across the street from the occupied building. That
was a reference to the former East German secret police chief,
Erich Mielke, who is now in jail pending investigation of criminal
charges of abuse of power.
   There were 21 activists holed up in Block 7 of the concrete
complex where the archives are kept.
   The activists want the East German government to demand changes
in parts of the treaty merging East and West German laws that
concern files on 6 million people kept by the Stasi, as the secret
police force was known.
   ``File holders of all countries, Unite!'' read one leaflet
distributed to passers-by.
   The treaty approved last week by the governments of the two
German states limits access to the files. However, activists worry
East German citizens will have little control over documents that
directly concern them. They also say the files will be at the
disposition of the future all-German government.
   ``No unification of the Stasi and the BND,'' said one banner.
The BND is the West German intelligence agency.
   The East German Cabinet agreed Wednesday to seek modifications
of the treaty with West Germany.
   East Berlin Mayor Tino Schwierzina expressed his solidarity with
the protesters, saying that ``only citizens of East Germany as
victims of Stasi terror have the right of access to their files.''
   The Stasi was formed after World War II with the help of the
experienced Soviet secret service. Its agents are blamed for
murdering East German refugees, hiding international terrorists,
and persecuting dissidents.
   The Hamburg-based magazine ``Stern'' this week reported that the
Stasi used radiation against millions of cars that went from West
Berlin to West Germany to detect East Germans trying to flee the
country.

   An American Legion post that rejected a
black Vietnam veteran for membership two months ago because of his
race has admitted the man after his second application.
   The Fred H. Sexton Post 1 approved the membership of Thurman L.
Thompson, 39, durring a closed-door meeting Tuesday night. Members
said the vote was 17-1. Post commander Allen Stein said he did not
know who cast the dissenting vote.
   ``I just want to go back to being Thurman L. Thompson Jr., who
happens to be a member of the American Legion,'' the U.S. Navy
veteran said after the meeting. ``I just wanted to be a member and
work toward helping the veterans and the community.''
   He said telephone calls and letters of encouragement from around
the country persuaded him to apply again.
   Thompson, a Naval reservist waiting to see if he will be ordered
to the Middle East, said he looks forward to watching and
participating in the American Legion baseball program.
   A nephew of Thompson and other teen-agers who live near his
Florence home play for the league. Thompson said he first became
interested in joining Post 1 because of its baseball team.
   Thompson said he is not bitter about the incident, which he
called ``unfortunate.''
   His initial application was rejected at a July 3 meeting in
which at least three members said they did not want a black into
the all-white post.
   After the vote became public, the state American Legion
temporarily suspended the post's charter pending an investigation
of the incident. The probe is continuing.
   The state Legion restored the charter in August after the post
amended its bylaws to ban segregation and eliminate the ability to
reject an applicant with just two votes. The post also promised to
invite Thompson to re-apply.
   State American Legion Commander J. Norris Kinion welcomed
Thompson to the post via telephone Tuesday night.
   ``I am thoroughly pleased that the events of the evening went
the way they did,'' Kinion said from his Greenville home. ``Cool
heads have prevailed.''

   Attorneys for a former Nazi guard argued
Wednesday that he should not be stripped of U.S. citizenship
because he knew nothing about the killings at the concentration
camp where he served during the Holocaust.
   The Justice Department has sought since 1988 to denaturalize
retired janitor Michael Schmidt on charges he illegally obtained a
visa to the United States shortly after World War II.
   The government argued before the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals that Schmidt, 67, failed to meet visa requirements because
he aided in the deaths of more than 100,000 people at the
Sachsenhausen prison outside of Berlin.
   ``Therefore, his naturalization was illegally procured,'' said
Ronnie Eddlman, an assistant U.S. attorney.
   But Schmidt's attorney, George Collins, said his client worked
only as a guard at Sachsenhausen and knew nothing about the
extermination of prisoners. Collins said that on his visa
application, Schmidt acknowledged he had served with the
Schutzstaffel, or SS, the elite military unit of the Nazi party
that served as a special police force.
   ``This is not visa fraud,'' Collins told the three-judge panel.
``The only thing before you is whether a man at a prison should be
denaturalized for things that went on inside that prison which he
didn't know about.''
   Collins argued that Schmidt, a native of Romania, wasn't privy
to events inside the camp because he only patrolled its perimeter
as an SS guard and escorted prisoners to work outside the camp.
Schmidt was 20 at the time.
   Ms. Eddlman urged the appellate court to uphold the decision
earlier this year of the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois, which ordered that Schmidt be denaturalized.
   ``It is not credible that the person did not have knowledge'' of
the killings inside the prison camp, she said.
   Collins disagreed.
   ``The evidence against him, that he was there, should be no
presumption of guilt,'' Collins said.
   Schmidt, who lives in suburban Lincolnwood, refused to comment
after the hearing. His wife, son and daughter, who also refused to
comment, attended the 25-minute proceedings with about 20 neighbors
and friends.
   ``He was just at the wrong place at the wrong time,'' said a
neighbor, Gerhard Taraschewsky.
   Schmidt would have to leave the country if the lower court's
ruling is affirmed. The appellate court took the arguments under
advisement and did not say when it might rule.

   Alaska Airlines and Federal Express will be
allowed to begin new air services to the Soviet Union, the
Transportation Department said Wednesday.
   The department also said it will hold hearings to award
passenger routes to three other carriers.
   Alaska Airlines had announced tentative approval of its
application to fly three times a week to the Soviet Far East cities
of Magadan and Khabarovsk. No other airline had applied for the
route.
   Twelve airlines have applied for other Soviet-U.S. routes
arranged in a June 1 aviation agreement between the two countries.
The agreement calls for four passenger and two cargo-only services
in addition to those by Pan Am, which is the only U.S. carrier now
serving the Soviet Union.
   Flights can begin April 1, and will be authorized for two years.
   Federal Express would provide all-cargo service between New York
and Moscow or Leningrad.
   The three additional routes for combination passenger and cargo
service will be over the Atlantic. An all-cargo route will be
assigned over the Pacific.
   No date was announced for the hearings, but an administrative
law judge is to make a recommendation for the routes by Feb. 19.
   Alaska Airline officials said they plan to fly to the Soviet
cities only during the summer because it would be too hard to fly
into those areas during harsh winter weather.
   The Soviet carrier Aeroflot would have permission to fly to San
Francisco and other U.S. cities, with a stopover in Anchorage. The
Soviet airline frequently lands at Anchorage International Airport
with goodwill and educational delegations, FAA officials said.

<DATELINE>CHERRYFIELD, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students in two school districts
traded in their books for rakes to help harvest a bumber crop of
wild blueberries, giving them a reprieve on the start of classes.
   This year's crop already exceeds the record 52.3 million pounds
harvested in 1988, officials say. And it's more than double the 26
million pounds processed last year, they say.
   As a result, hundreds of students in the Cherryfield and Machias
areas in eastern Maine, who were scheduled to return to school
Wednesday, won't go back to classes until Monday.
   ``The crop is unusually large and the blueberry industry means a
great deal to the economy of this area,'' said William Clark,
superintendent of School Union 102 in Machias.
   The school district that serves Cherryfield and eight
neighboring towns agreed in late June to a request by blueberry
processors to move back the start of the school year to accommodate
what was already shaping up to be a bountiful harvest.
   The abnormally large amount of fruit is attributed to good
growing weather _ adequate rain the year before to form the flower
buds, sufficient snow cover to prevent winter kill and good
pollinating weather in the spring.
   The blueberry yield also was helped by the more than 30,000
beehives imported into Maine to bolster the native pollinators.
   ``The bees were out there, working real hard,'' said Edward J.
McLaughlin, executive director of the Maine Blueberry Commission.
   Maine's ``wild blues'' are frozen and sold primarily to large
food processors. They're used in such products as pancakes and
muffin mixes.
   Although mechanical harvesters were introduced in some areas of
the areas, most of the raking is still done by hand. Rakers
generally earn about $150 a day, although the fastest workers have
been known to make over $200.
   School children who work in the fields count on the cash to buy
winter clothes or save for college.
   ``A typical kid might make $60 a day, which is pretty good if
you're 13 or 14 years old,'' said Russell Libby of the state
Department of Agriculture.
   Teachers also take part in the harvest. ``We have two who are
foremen on the receiving docks,'' said Joseph White, superintendent
of School Administrative District 37 in Harrington.

   President Bush said Wednesday that the United

congressmen said the year-old program isn't doing enough to help
impoverished Americans.
   ``Drug czar (William J.) Bennett and President Bush cannot deny
that we are losing the drug war in our inner cities,'' said Rep.
John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the House Committee on
Government Operations.
   ``Prevention and education efforts directed at the educated
middle class appear to be having a dramatic effect,'' Conyers said.
``Treatment programs have room for clients who can afford to pay.
However, the chronically addicted cannot pay when they are poor and
unemployed, as is often the case.''
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, chairman of the House Select Committee
on Narcotics Abuse and Control, agreed with Conyers' criticisms,
saying the statistics showing improvement primarily pertain to the
middle class.
   ``Unfortunately, the administration's anti-drug strategy has not
been responsive to the concerns of inner city and other chronic
drug abusers, whose drug abuse is fueling the crisis in our
emergency rooms, in our criminal justice system and in our
treatment centers,'' said Rangel, D-N.Y.
   Bush and Bennett, the president's chief lieutenant in the drug
war, emphasized the positive in speeches and a white paper released
Wednesday, the first anniversary of the president's announcement of
his war on drugs.
   ``I think America is making progress against drugs and will
continue to do so,'' Bush said, but he acknowledged that the war is
far from won.
   ``There is still too much violence, too much destruction, too
many innocent victims,'' he told a gathering of staff and
reporters. ``Drugs are still an international menace.''
   And he committed his administration to ``remain on the front
lines until this scourge is licked for good,'' even as the
government seems preoccupied with the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``I know that other subjects preoccupy all of us these days. But
this one remains No. 1, will continue to remain No. 1 when the
international situation has calmed down,'' Bush said.
   The president said that signs of progress included Americans'
increasing hostility toward drugs, declines in casual drug use, law
enforcement successes at home and in Latin America and the
reduction in cocaine supplies.
   Cocaine, Bush said, is ``harder to find, more expensive, less
pure than it was just one year ago.''
   Conyers, however, urged revising the federal drug budget to
spend as much on treatment and prevention as is spent on law
enforcement. The current split is almost 70 percent for law
enforcement with the remainder going for treatment and prevention.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, released a report citing some successes of the
drug war and some failures, including an increased number of
murders this year, inadequate drug education and lack of treatment
for pregnant or incarcerated addicts.
   ``Much progress has been made in fighting drug use, but
declarations of victory in the drug war are still far away,'' Biden
said.
   New York City police Commissioner Lee Brown, appearing before
Biden's committee Wednesday, said initial enthusiasm over the war
on drugs was dampened by a lack of sufficient federal funds for
local lawmen.
   New York, he said, was designated a ``high intensity drug area''
under the program and made eligible for increased funding. But he
said none of the $4 million in additional aid went directly to
local police.
   ``The national drug control strategy needs redirecting,'' he
said.
   Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates told the panel that the
drug strategy ``may not be perfect, but I think it is a good one.''
   Bennett, director of national drug control policy, said
Wednesday that he was not declaring any victories, but simply
publicizing signs that the situation may not be as bleak as it once
appeared.
   He said that when he was confirmed to his job 18 months ago,
``most commentators _ friends and critics both _ described the work
ahead in almost apocalyptic terms. The drug crisis was `hopeless,'
`beyond control,' `getting worse with no end in sight.'''
   Now, he said, ``the drug problem _ in general, nationwide _ is
no longer getting worse, and in some very significant aspects it is
now getting better. Not victory, but success.''
   Bush made the drug strategy announcement Sept. 5, 1989, in his
first prime-time televised speech.

<HEAD>International Commission Accuses Soviets in Wallenberg Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international commission found Wednesday that
the Soviet government issued misleading statements on the fate of
Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat credited with saving tens of
thousands of Hungarian Jews from the Nazis during World War II.
   Wallenberg vanished after the Soviets arrested him in Budapest
in 1945 in the war's final days on allegations he spied for
Germany. Moscow later said he had died.
   Wallenberg's relatives say they received reports he is alive
under detention in the Soviet Union. He would now be 77.
   The 25-member private commission, composed of Soviet, Swedish,
U.S. and Canadian members, said its investigation of the conduct of
Soviet authorities in the case ``brings into question their moral
standing'' in the matter.
   Wallenberg, a member of a prominent family of bankers and
industrialists, repeatedly risked his life by hiding Jews in houses
he bought or rented, often with his own money. Shortly before
Budapest was liberated, he persuaded the Nazis to cancel a plan to
kill 70,000 Jews still living in the city's ghetto.
   In 1981, the United States made Wallenberg an honorary citizen.
   Swedish authorities presented the Kremlin with witnesses'
reports in the 1950s and 1960s that Wallenberg was alive and was
seen by non-Soviets at Vladimir Prison, 12 miles outside Moscow.
   The Soviets responded with ``The Gromyko Memorandum'' of Feb. 6,
1957, saying they investigated reports from Vladimir Prison and
concluded Wallenberg died of a heart attack in Moscow's Lubyanka
Prison in 1947.
   This year, the Soviets opened some archives to foreign
investigators for the first time and let the commission hold
interviews and search files at Vladimir Prison.
   ``We have found that the Soviet Union never conducted any
investigation at Vladimir Prison,'' said the report, issued at a
news conference by the newly formed Soviet-International Joint
Commission on the Fate and Whereabouts of Raoul Wallenberg.
   It found that despite Soviet claims of having investigated the
case, ``prison archives were not examined, prison officials were
not interviewed, and witnesses whose testimony was relevant were
not examined.''
   ``This finding is particularly disturbing _ and painful _ as the
Soviet Union continued to receive testimony from the Swedish
government in the 1950s, based largely on witness testimony from
imprisoned foreign nationals at Vladimir Prison who had left the
Soviet Union, that Raoul Wallenberg was alive in the 1950s.
   ``Yet for 12 years, from 1945-57, the Soviet Union insisted that
`Raoul Wallenberg is not in the Soviet Union and he is not known to
us.'''
   Quoting from the Gromyko Memorandum, named after the late Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko, Kremlin authorities looked into
the matter and could not find ``any information whatsoever about
Wallenberg being in the Soviet Union. . . . None of those
interrogated knew anything about Wallenberg.''
   ``Accordingly the Commission's finding that no investigation had
ever been conducted by the Soviet Union at Vladimir Prison not only
discredits the Gromyko Memorandum and the Soviet position that
Wallenberg died in 1947, but brings into question their moral
standing to make any claim whatever in the absence of any
investigation by them,'' it said
   The commission also found that the KGB secret police kept its
own files on incarcerated foreigners.
   ``Accordingly, the commission finds it rather incredulous that
the KGB claimed to have discovered `by accident' in October 1989
items belonging to Raoul Wallenberg (prison registration card,
passport, money, personal belongings) and which it turned over to
the Wallenberg family during their visit . . ..
   ``Indeed, the former director of archives at Vladimir . . .
found this KGB claim to be rather ludicrous.
   ``Moreover, the KGB had previously claimed for 32 years that it
had no information or materials whatsoever relating to Raoul
Wallenberg.''
   Members of the commission include Wallenberg's brother, Guy von
Dardel of Sweden; Irwin Cotler of Canada; Marvin W. Markinen, an
American professor who formerly was incarcerated at Vladimir
Prison; Cronid Lubarsky, another former Vladmir inmate; and Rolf
Bjornerstedt, a former United Nations assistant secretary. It also
included five Soviets.

<HEAD>Aquarium's Plan to Trade Dolphin to Navy Launches Protest Wave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aquarium director was reconsidering plans to
trade an aggressive, unsociable show dolphin to the Navy after news
of the deal set off a wave of protests from animal-rights activists.
   The New England Aquarium and the Navy worked out the swap, which
would have enlisted Rainbow, an 11-year-old male, in the secret
underwater mammal program at the Naval Ocean Systems Center in San
Diego.
   Aquarium director John H. Prescott said Wednesday that the angry
public reaction prompted him to rethink the trade.
   ``I think the decision is good for the animals concerned,''
Prescott said. ``(But) if it's causing public concern, I must pay
attention. It's not a closed issue.''
   Rainbow, 8-foot-2 and 450 pounds, is a blue-gray bottlenose
dolphin. One of three show dolphins at the aquarium, it became
cantankerous as it matured.
   Prescott sought a swap: Rainbow for a female.
   Other aquariums refused. But the Navy center, which looks after,
studies and trains 142 marine mammals including 109 dolphins,
eventually agreed to take Rainbow in exchange for a partly deaf
female.
   The center trains dolphins in underwater surveillance and
detecting, locating and marking objects for recovery. Other details
are are classified, said Tom LaPuzza, a spokesman at the San Diego
center.
   The trade was delayed because the military buildup in the
Persian Gulf took Navy planes that could have been used to
transport Rainbow.
   News of the deal got out Thursday, and animal rights activists
raised an outcry.
   ``We have been attempting to persuade the aquarium not to
capture wild dolphins and whales ... Our efforts are more urgent
now that we learn that the aquarium is acting as a clearinghouse
for animals for the military,'' the Boston Marine Mammal Coalition
said in a statement.
   A protest at the aquarium was set for Saturday.
   The aquarium got so many calls it recorded a message to
intercept them, inviting anyone concerned about Rainbow to send a
letter.
   National interest in the Navy dolphins was galvanized by reports
in 1988 that 13 dolphins in Navy training had died between 1986 and
1988. Nearly half the animals suffered from lack of appetite or
stomach ulcers before their deaths, the report said. Other causes
were hepatitis and pneumonia.
   A federal Marine Mammal Commission probe found no major problems
in the program. No Navy animals have died in the past 13 months,
LaPuzza said.
   Then in May, a former trainer told the media that bottlenose
dolphins with .45-caliber guns mounted on their snouts were being
trained by the Navy to kill enemy frogmen.
   LaPuzza denies such claims.
   The Navy has ``never trained marine mammals to kill people and
will never do so,'' LaPuzza said. ``We do not train mammals to
perform operations that will put them in danger.''
   The Navy did use dolphins for military work in Vietnam and in
1986 and 1987 in the Persian Gulf, however, LaPuzza said. He
refused to say what the mammals did. There aren't any immediate
plans to use dolphins in the gulf crisis, he said.
   The aquarium has given the Navy three dolphins since 1980, all
animals it couldn't take for various reasons, Prescott said,
praising the care the military gives the animals.
   The Boston controversy coincides with a similar one in
Washington state. In Silverdale, Wash., Wednesday night the Navy
planned to hear public concerns about the Navy's intention to use
dolphins to guard Trident submarines at Bangor, Wash.
   The hearing is part of a settlement reached after 15 animal
rights groups sued the Navy in April 1989, claiming that bringing
the warm-water dolphins to the colder waters of Hood Canal required
an environmental assessment under the National Environmental Policy
Act.
   The suit was dropped when the Navy agreed to make that
assessment.

   The Bush administration said Wednesday, four
days before the U.S.-Soviet summit, that it would take a fresh look
at economic aid for the Soviet Union in light of Moscow's ``real
and very helpful support'' in the Persian Gulf.
   The administration had previously rejected the idea, but
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``The Soviet
cooperation in the gulf has impressed us to the point where we are
even more interested in being supportive economically if we can
be.''
   Meanwhile, the White House announced that President Bush would
address a joint session of Congress next Tuesday night after
returning from his weekend summit with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. Bush's topics, aides said, would include the summit and
the gulf crisis.
   According to a White House statement, Bush had brought up the
idea of the joint session appearance earlier in the day in
conversations with House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   ``Speaker Foley extended an invitation to the president on
behalf of both chambers,'' the statement said.
   White House aides said that the speech would deal primarily with
the Persian Gulf crisis but that Bush would also give lawmakers a
rundown on his session in Helsinki with Gorbachev.
   In pre-summit comments, White House officials seemed to be going
out of their way to praise the Soviets.
   Fitzwater said he was certain the issue of Western economic aid
to Moscow would come up at Sunday's summit. The administration
opposed direct economic aid as recently as last July at the
economic summit of seven industrial nations in Houston.
   But, Fitzwater said of the Soviets, ``They have sent ships to
the gulf. They have been supportive. President Gorbachev has made
some strong public statements'' of support for the U.N.-backed
trade embargo against Iraq.
   He said Gorbachev's words ``have a political impact in the world
of countries that have formally been aligned with the Soviet Union
that is very hard to measure, but one which we know is real and has
been very helpful''
   Furthermore, Fitzwater said, the United States is ``willing to
talk'' with the Soviet Union about a longstanding Soviet proposal _
revived on Tuesday by Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze _ for a
Middle East peace conference.
   The conference, which the United States long has opposed, would
seek to resolve all conflicts in the region, including the
Arab-Israeli dispute.
   In the past, Moscow has been Iraq's principal arms supplier.
However, after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the Kremlin cut
off arms sales although several hundred Soviet military advisers
remained in Iraq.
   Some lawmakers, back from visits to the Middle East, urged Bush
at the White House on Wednesday to press Gorbachev to pull Russian
military advisers out of Iraq and to provide the United States with
intelligence information on Iraq's military capability.
   But, as to the military advisers, Fitzwater said: ``There is no
sense in getting argumentative with the Soviets on this issue.''
   Fitzwater portrayed the continued presence of the Soviet
advisers as a ``marginal'' problem, and not one that threatened the
effectiveness of the embargo against Iraq.
   The spokesman said that Bush wants to discuss with Gorbachev the
status of an International Monetary Fund review of Soviet economic
needs.
   The study was commissioned at the Houston summit as a compromise
between the United States, which opposed direct economic aid to the
Soviets, and West Germany and France, which favored it.
   Noting reports of bread shortages and other economic
deprivations in the Soviet Union, Fitzwater said: ``We'll be very
interested in President Gorbachev's analysis of what his problems
are and whether or not the West can be helpful and in what areas.''
   Fitzwater said he did not expect a final resolution of the
economic aid issue at Helsinki.
   Meanwhile, administration officials said it now seems unlikely
that Bush will stop in Brussels on his way home from Helsinki to
brief allies on the Gorbachev summit _ as had been discussed
earlier.
   The White House said Bush had decided to postpone until later in
the month a political trip to Colorado and California that had been
scheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday.

<HEAD>Democrats Chiles, Nelson Pledge Unity Against Martinez</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats rallied Wednesday around
their landslide gubernatorial primary winner, Lawton Chiles, who
launched what's expected to be a tough general election campaign
against Republican Gov. Bob Martinez.
   In Nevada, political newcomer Jim Galloway opened his Republican
gubernatorial campaign by trying to draw Democratic incumbent Gov.
Bob Miller into a debate.
   Florida's first-term governor was spoiling for a fight, saying
in Tampa that he'd leave the rallies to the Democrats.
   ``We've had the unity. We don't need the rally,'' said Martinez,
who got 69 percent of the vote in Tuesday's GOP primary.
   Democratic officeholders ranging from Sen. Bob Graham to county
commissioners joined about 250 people Wednesday on the steps of the
Capitol to celebrate the victory by the man nicknamed ``Walkin'
Lawton.''
   Chiles and running mate Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay of Ocala, a
former congressman, got 69 percent of the vote and carried 65 of 67
counties in defeating Bill Nelson, a six-term congressman from
Melbourne.
   Nelson criticized Chiles sharply during the campaign for
accepting what he called ``sweetheart'' financial deals.
   He also suggested that Chiles wasn't healthy enough to handle
the governor's office; Chiles had said he was burned out when he
decided in 1988 against re-election to the U.S. Senate and later
revealed he'd been taking antidepressant drugs.
   On Wednesday, Nelson called that a ``family fight'' and said he
and his running mate, House Speaker Tom Gustafson, were committed
to supporting the Chiles-MacKay ticket.
   ``I decided to come here today not just to say pretty words, but
to suggest some things I could do,'' Nelson said. Later, he went to
the Chiles headquarters to telephone supporters about contributing
to the party nominee.
   Chiles said he held no grudges: ``The enduring friendship that
we have, and have had over the years, did endure.''
   According to complete but unofficial vote totals, Chiles got
739,916 votes, or 69 percent, to Nelson's 325,448 votes, or 31
percent. In the GOP race, Martinez got 457,952 votes, also 69
percent, to state Sen. Marlene Woodson Howard's 131,782 votes, or
20 percent. Three other candidates split the rest of the Republican
vote.
   Chiles has run well ahead of Martinez in most polls, but the
governor has begun to close the gap recently. Martinez has a huge
campaign war chest ready for the campaign and plans a new
television ad blitz beginning this week.
   Martinez called for debates before journalists, which Chiles has
said he doesn't like. He said he did not intend to bring up
questions of Chiles' health but hinted that voters should watch the
Democratic nominee closely.
   ``People will make that judgment _ how healthy he is by the
vigor he may show, how he addresses debates or does he stay vague,
does he speak on the issues?'' Martinez said.
   In Nevada, it was the challenger, Gallaway, who said he wanted
to get the governor ``out from behind his desk'' to debate.
   Final results of the voting were delayed by massive computer
failures in the Las Vegas area, where most of the state's voters
live. Clark County election officials blamed computer glitches,
poorly trained volunteers and soggy ballots for a vote count fiasco
that left some local candidates guessing their fate the day after
the election.
   But nearly complete returns showed Miller, who is seeking a full
term in the job he inherited two years ago, winning the Democratic
primary with 66,998 votes, or 81 percent. He was followed by ``None
of the Above'' _ a protest option on all Nevada ballots that
tallied 6,754 votes, or 8 percent; and a long-shot hopeful named
Rhinestone Cowboy with 2,308 votes, or 3 percent.
   Gallaway, a businessman and newcomer to Nevada politics, had
35,628 votes, or 50 percent, in his eight-way GOP race. ``None of
the Above'' drew 15,637 votes, or 22 percent, and builder Charlie
Brown had 14,966 votes, or 21 percent.

<TEXT>
   Calling South Africa's
anti-apartheid course ``irreversible,'' President F.W. de Klerk on
Wednesday invited groups of all races to join negotiations on a new
constitution.
   ``Now is the time to wipe out petty differences,'' he said.
   The government and African National Congress were scheduled to
continue talks Thursday, despite tension over the army's
involvement in a township shooting that killed 11 people.
   An ANC spokeswoman said she knew of no change in the plans for
Thursday's meeting.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela visited black townships near
Johannesburg wracked by fighting that has killed more than 550
people since Aug. 12.
   Mandela repeated accusations that police fueled the fighting by
siding with Zulu backers of the conservative Inkatha movement
against Xhosas and other blacks loyal to the ANC. Police deny the
charges and say they have prevented the violence from escalating.
   Defense Minister Gen. Magnus Malan said black leaders appeared
unable to control their followers and should stop blaming police
and soldiers for the unrest.
   Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said a meeting with Mandela
could help curb the violence, but Mandela has refused such a
meeting.
   The ANC blames Inkatha for starting the recent fighting, but an
Inkatha youth leader accused the ANC on Wednesday of trying to wipe
out his group's members.
   The townships were reported quiet Wednesday after a day in which
40 people were killed.
   ``A momentum has begun which is making the negotiation process
irreversible,'' de Klerk told a governing National Party congress
in the central city of Bloemfontain. ``We will not turn back, nor
will we be stopped at giving every South African a say in
decision-making.''
   He said all parties were welcome in talks on power-sharing
between the black majority and the ruling whites.
   De Klerk has proposed the National Party accept non-whites as
members, and he says he wants a new constitution within five years
that will bring blacks into the national government. However, he
has stated opposition to black majority rule and a one-person,
one-vote system.
   The government opened talks this year with the ANC, the main
black opposition group, on halting anti-government violence and
removing other obstacles toward constitutional negotiations.
   Government and ANC committees were scheduled to meet Thursday to
discuss the ANC's decision last month to suspend its armed struggle.
   The talks were expected to focus on the status of ANC
guerrillas, both inside and outside South Africa, as well as what
to do with existing arms caches in the country, several newspapers
reported.
   Meanwhile, violence has raged in black townships near
Johannesburg.
   In Sebokeng, south of the city, soldiers opened fire Tuesday on
a crowd outside a migrant workers' hostel, leaving 11 dead. Many in
the crowd were ANC supporters.
   Police and army officials said they would investigate the
shooting.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the nation's largest
labor federation, and a group of Anglican bishops led by Archbishop
Desmond Tutu echoed Mandela's call for a judicial inquiry of the
Sebokeng shootings.
   In March, police opened fire on black protesters, killing at
least five and wounding 150. A judicial inquiry last week concluded
the gunfire was not necessary.
   The ANC suspended talks with the government after the March
shooting.
   Also Wednesday, police said they will bar the news media from
areas of unrest when they believe demonstrators are acting up for
journalists.
   Police spokesman Capt. Eugene Opperman said the final decision
on whether to order journalists away from an area would be left to
the commanding officer.
   Opperman said police could order journalists to leave unrest
areas under emergency regulations in the townships.

   A member of the House Democratic leadership,
angered by Japan's slow response to aid the United States in the
Persian Gulf crisis, on Wednesday called for forcing the Asian
nation to pay for U.S. troops stationed in Japan.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., the fourth ranking Democrat in the
House, said he wrote his measure, which will be offered when the
House considers the fiscal 1991 defense bill, before Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait last month.
   But the chief deputy majority whip said the amendment is
``needed now more than ever.''
   Japan has announced that it would supply the United States with
a $1 billion assistance package, but Bonior said it seems now that
the aid will be delayed.
   ``Everyone is bellying up and doing their part, and they're
hanging back. I think that's grossly unfair,'' Bonior told a news
conference.
   The Michigan Democrat complained that U.S. forces in the gulf
region are protecting the oil interests of American allies,
including Japan which can afford to pay for its defense as well as
the defense of oil supplies.
   ``Too often we have seen Japanese promises and no action. They
should pay a greater share in the Persian Gulf and they should pay
for our troops protecting Japan,'' Bonior said.
   According to Bonior's estimates, the United States spends $4.5
billion annually to station about 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan while
the Asian nation contributes $2.9 billion.
   Under the amendment, President Bush would have one year to
negotiate with Japan on having them foot the bill. If Japan
refuses, 5,000 troops would be withdrawn at the end of September
1991 and each year afterward.
   While calling for increased Japanese aid in the gulf region,
Bonior dismissed suggestions that Japan should share in the
leadership as the United States undertakes Operation Desert Shield.
   ``I am not for them calling any military shots. I would strongly
argue against the deployment of Japanese defense forces beyond what
has already been agreed to,'' Bonior said.
   The Democratic leader said he expects the House to take up the
defense authorization bill next week.

   Rain and thunderstorms were scattered across broad sections of
the nation Wednesday, and hot weather continued from the central
Plains into the Ohio Valley.
   Kansas City, Mo., hit a record high of 95.
   Several schools in Nebraska scheduled early class dismissals for
a second day this week because of the heat and lack of air
conditioning in classrooms.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from western New York state
across northern and western Pennsylvania during the afternoon, and
across eastern Ohio, northern West Virginia and Maryland, with a
threat of heavy rain.
   Showers and storms also reached over Florida, southeastern
Louisiana, and along the lower Texas Gulf Coast.
   Late Tuesday, wind up to 78 mph ripped the roof from at least
one building and knocked out power to 46,000 homes and businesses
during a brief but heavy thunderstorm that hit the New Orleans area.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over western Upper
Michigan, northwestern Wisconsin, east-central through northwestern
Minnesota and eastern North Dakota.
   Showers and storms extended over the southern half of New
Mexico, north-central Colorado, southwestern Montana, northeastern
Wyoming, eastern Idaho, southern Nevada and southeastern California.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.48 inches at West Palm Beach, Fla., and 0.86 of an inch at the
Naval air station near Jacksonville, Fla.
   Tropical Storm Isidore formed over the Atlantic but was not a
threat to any major land area. Its center was 750 miles southwest
of the Cape Verde islands off the coast of Africa.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 31 at Truckee, Calif.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57 at
San Simeon, Calif., to 102 at Longview, Texas.

<HEAD>Lord Caradon, Former British Ambassador to United Nations, Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lord Caradon, the former British permanent
representative to the United Nations, died Wednesday in a Plymouth
nursing home. Caradon was 82, said his son, Paul Foot.
   No cause of death was given for Caradon, who spent more than 30
years in Britain's former Colonial Office, and helped four colonies
gain independence.
   He was not afraid to differ with the governments he served and
once resigned rather than defend a policy he did not support.
   Caradon was born Hugh Foot on Oct. 8, 1907, the son of a
distinguished political family.
   His brother, Michael, was leader of the Labor Party opposition
from 1980 to 1983 and remains a Labor member of parliament.
   Caradon was educated at Leighton Park, a Quaker school at
Reading and at Cambridge University. He was president of the
Cambridge Union, a student body, in 1929.
   Later that year he entered the old Colonial Office, which was
responsible for administering Britain's colonies.
   In 1943, he was appointed Colonial Secretary in Cyprus, acting
as governor in 1944.
   The next 13 years he held a variety of Colonial Office posts,
including the Chief Secretary in Nigeria and Governor-in-Chief of
Jamaica. He was knighted in 1951.
   From 1957-60, Caradon was Governor and Commander-in-Chief in
Cyprus.
   He is credited with bringing the rival Greek and Turkish leaders
together and he left the island having completed his mission to
forge a new independent republic.
   A government citation praises his ``wisdom, courage and
humanity, and his unwearying efforts in the Cyprus negotiations.''
   In 1961, Caradon went to the United Nations as British
Representative on the Trusteeship Council. But he did not agree
with what he considered the British government's lenient attitude
toward the white minority in the colony of Rhodesia and resigned
rather than speak for a policy he did not support.
   In 1963, he was appointed consultant to the U.N. Special Fund,
dealing with the governments of newly independent countries on
matters of economic development.
   The British government made him a life peer in 1964 and sent him
to the United Nations as Permanent Representative, a post he held
until 1970.
   During this time he gathered support for sanctions against Ian
Smith's Rhodesia after Smith made his Unilateral Declaration of
Independence. He also served on the U.N. Expert Group on South
Africa.
   He retired in 1970, but continued with some of his United
Nations activities, becoming a consultant on the U.N. Development
Programme.
   In a television interview, Caradon admitted he never smiled when
journalists were nearby.
   ``It was one of the first lessons I learned in the diplomatic
service,'' he confided. ``You never know when there may be a stray
photographer near and in the newspapers the next morning, alongside
the headlines saying `100,000 people dead,' there is a picture of
you smiling all over your face.''
   Caradon married Florence Tod in 1936. She died in 1985. He is
survived by three sons and a daughter.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<HEAD>Government Extends State of Emergency in Capital, Rebels Kill Boy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday extended the state
of emergency in the nation's capital by 30 days and limited
freedoms to help the military fight leftist guerrillas.
   Meanwhile, police said rebels of the Maoist Shining Path group
killed a 9-year-old boy in a highland village attack Tuesday.
   The boy was shot once with a rifle when he tried to run from
Nueva Florida after about 15 rebels invaded the village 45 miles
northeast of Ayacucho, police said.
   Ayacucho, a stronghold of the Shining Path, is 230 miles
southeast of Lima.
   The state of emergency was first imposed in Lima and its nearby
port of Callao in early August. A military decree issued Wednesday
replaced the police state of emergency that had been in effect.
   The decree suspends freedom of travel and assembly and allows
authorities to detain people without court hearings and to search
homes without warrants.
   All or part of 10 other states, representing more than one-third
of Peru's territory, also are under emergency rule. More than half
the country's 22 million people live in these areas.
   Almost 20,000 Peruvians have died in political violence in the
10 years since the Shining Path first took up arms against the
government.

<HEAD>Decade-Long Study Says Acid Rain Isn't an Environmental Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $537 million, decade-long study ordered by
Congress concluded Thursday that acid rain should be ``viewed as a
long-term problem'' requiring pollution controls but is not the
environmental crisis some scientists have suggested.
   The report by the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program
was embraced both by those who support steep cuts in sulfur dioxide
emissions and by critics of such cuts. The critics have long
claimed that severe pollution controls, costing as much as $5
billion a year, are an overreaction to the acid rain problem.
   In its final draft report, the scientific group, known as NAPAP,
reiterated that pollution-control measures are needed to return
hundreds of lakes and streams _ especially in the Northeast and the
mid-Atlantic states _ to healthy conditions.
   The report also acknowledged that acid rain is affecting
visibility across much of the East; causes damage to some forests,
particularly red spruce at higher elevations; reduces soil
nutrients; kills some aquatic life; erodes buildings and statutes,
and poses health problems to some humans exposed to acidic aerosols.
   James Mahoney, director of NAPA, outlined the draft report to a
final meeting of the group and said its findings have ``reduced the
scientific uncertainties'' about acid rain.
   ``Acid rain is correctly viewed as a long-term problem which
should be resolved by permanent measures,'' he concluded,
summarizing the findings.
   Mahoney said that while the study supports many of the
scientific views expressed over the years on acid rain it also
rejected other, ``more extreme views'' such as those that consider
it ``a flat-out crisis'' or those ``who would say there's no
problem at all.''
   NAPAP was established by Congress in 1980 to improve the
understanding of acid rain. During its decade of work it spent $537
million.
   The report stopped short of endorsing specific control
requirements, including the 10-million-ton cut in sulfur dioxide
emissions required by legislation nearing approval in Congress.
   The study said, however, that if annual sulfur dioxide emissions
were cut by 10 million tons the damaging trends would be reversed.
Such emission controls would lead to the ``chemical recovery'' of
lakes in the Adirondacks, where the acid rain problem is said to be
most severe, and protect lakes in the higher elevations of the
mid-Atlantic states. It also would reduce other damages caused by
acid rain and improve visibility.
   But the pollution controls would not be cheap, with the expense
increasing sharply as steeper emission reductions are put in place.
An 8-million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions would cost
$1.7 billion to $2.7 billion a year, while cuts of 10 million tons
would cost as much as $4 billion a year, the study estimated.
   The most severe pollution control requirements would have to be
imposed on electric utilities, especially those burning high-sulfur
coal in the Midwest, for the results to be effective, the study
said.
   The National Coal Association issued a statement urging that
Congress ease its acid rain pollution controls in light of the
NAPAP study. ``The report provides strong evidence that there is
time to implement more cost-effective ways in which to mitigate the
limited environmental impacts of acid rain,'' said Richard Lawson,
the association's president.
   But Eileen Claussen, a senior director involved with air
pollution issues at the EPA, said the NAPAP report ``clearly
establishes the link between (sulfur) emissions and environmental
damage'' and supports the Bush administration's call for tough
pollution controls by coal-burning electric utilities.
   President Bush has supported legislation calling for utilities
to reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by the
end of the decade. Clean air legislation approved by the House and
Senate and awaiting action by a conference committee would require
such reductions.

<TEXT>
   The United States will open talks with
Cambodia in an effort to reach an agreement that could end that
country's nearly 20 years of civil war, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III said Wednesday.
   ``We don't suggest for one minute that we're home on Cambodia,
but we think things are moving in the right direction,'' Baker told
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   He said the United States would hold talks in Laos with
representatives of Hun Sen, prime minister of the Vietnamese-backed
Cambodian government.
   The United States said in July that it would begin talks with
Vietnam on the Cambodian civil war.
   The Bush administration has withdrawn its diplomatic recognition
of the Cambodian guerrilla coalition, which included the Communist
Khmer Rouge.
   Last month, the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council announced an agreement on the main elements of a
settlement. But Sunday, Cambodian President Heng Samrin said his
intention was ``to maintain the status quo _ both politically and
militarily.''
   Still, Baker told the committee the administration was pleased
with the action taken by the United States, the Soviet Union,
China, Britain and France.
   ``We think that offers the greatest prospect for a stable
outcome to the conflict,'' Baker said.

<HEAD>Wiretap Scandal Shakes Israeli Government, Divides Jews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scandal dubbed Israel's Watergate eclipsed
news of the Persian Gulf crisis here Wednesday, featuring
accusations of high-level political fraud and questions on the
propriety of wiretapping under Jewish law.
   It rattled nerves in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
narrow-based coalition Cabinet and renewed tension between Israel's
two main communities _ Sephardic Jews from Africa and the Middle
East and Ashkanazim of European origin.
   National Police Commissioner Yaacov Turner, under fire for
investigating Interior Minister Ariyeh Deri, defended himself
against charges by Deri's supporters that the probe began because
Deri is a Sephardic Jew born in Morocco.
   ``It's crazy,'' Turner said. ``To prevent an investigation they
are willing to break up an entire people. Whoever helps this along
is worse than a criminal.''
   Police Minister Roni Milo, of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
Likud bloc, said he will summon Turner on Thursday to discuss that
comment.
   A statement from Milo's office, carried by Israel television,
said Turner's comments ``dealt with issues . . . not related to
proper functioning of the police force and its national tasks.''
   The scandal began last week with reports that five people were
held on suspicion of bugging the telephone of investigative
reporter Mordechai Gilat of the newspaper Yediot Ahronot.
   A recorder was found on a motorcycle outside Gilat's home, with
wires running through his phone box and into his Tel Aviv apartment.
   Gilat wrote articles in June that led to police investigation of
Deri, 31, a leading member of the ultra-Orthodox Torah Guardians
Party, known by the Hebrew acronym Shas. Deri is suspected of
misappropriating millions of shekels in government money by
diverting funds from local councils to religious institutions after
taking office in December 1988.
   A shekel is worth just over 50 cents.
   Deri denied the charges on national TV. Both he and police have
refused to comment on his interrogation by investigators Tuesday.
   Israeli reports said Wednesday police also suspected Deri had
advance knowledge about Gilat's being wiretapped. Deri has not
commented.
   Deri's supporters seek to use the tapes as a possible way to
exonerate him. Some Israeli reports said the recordings contained
conversations between Gilat and Turner, coordinating their moves.
   The issue led to radio discussions by religious experts on what
Jewish law has to say about admitting a wiretap as evidence.
   Some rabbis argued that 13th-century sage Gershon Ben Solomon of
Arles, France, ordered a man punished for reading someone else's
mail without consent. The same principle could be applied to a
wiretap, they reasoned.
   Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef of Shas, a former chief Sephardic rabbi,
said nobody could hide his words or deeds from God.
   ``The Almighty has a tape with television pictures,'' he was
quoted as telling followers. ``Nobody can go to heaven and claim to
the creator, `I never said such things.'''
   Deri's supporters demand the tapes be declared legal evidence
and that Turner be ousted if found to be in the wrong.
   Gilat won a Supreme Court injunction Monday barring use of the
tapes.
   Questions over Turner's role also motivated Shas leaders to
charge Deri was being persecuted because of his North African
origins.
   ``It is all a plot against the Sephardic community,'' Israel
radio quoted Rabbi Shabtai Atun, a Shas supporter, as saying.
   The Sephardim comprise about 60 percent of Jewish Israelis. The
Ashkanazim, who gained political power in pre-state Israel, still
dominate the government, however.
   Cabinet members from Shas raised the Deri issue at Sunday's
Cabinet meeting. News reports said Communications Minister Raphael
Pinchasi of Shas won Shamir's promise that the fraud probe against
Deri would be carried out quickly before it could upset the
political balance.
   Shas has five seats in the 120-member Parliament, but is a key
player among the 10 parties in Shamir's government. It brought down
Shamir's coalition with the Labor Party on March 15 by abstaining
in a vote of no confidence.
   Wiretaps also were featured in the Watergate scandal that drove
Richard Nixon from the presidency in 1974.

<HEAD>Armenian Party Chief Threatens to Quit Politburo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armenia's Communist Party chief has threatened to
quit the Soviet Politburo unless President Mikhail S. Gorbachev can
restore order in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, news
reports said Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, the Armenian parliament passed a resolution
complaining that citizens of the predominantly Armenian territory
located inside the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan are having
their rights trampled upon, the Tass news agency reported.
   ``The Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh continues to be
subject to terror on the part of Azerbaijani authorities, assisted
by units of the Soviet army and Interior Ministry troops,'' Tass
quoted the resolution as saying.
   A state of emergency is in effect in the mountainous region,
part of Azerbaijan since 1923. Ethnic battles between residents of
the two Caucasus republics over who should control the area have
left more than 200 people dead the past two years.
   Vladimir Movsisyan, the Communist Party leader of Armenia, said
in an appeal published in the republic's newspapers Wednesday that
indifference and indecision on the part of the Soviet leadership
have given Azerbaijan's leaders ``a free hand to pursue an
anti-Armenian policy,'' according to the independent Interfax news
service.
   It quoted him as saying misinformation circulated about
Armenians' ``aggressive activity'' in Azerbaijan has put the two
republics on the verge of war.
   Movsisyan, who as the republic's Communist Party leader is a
member of the Soviet Politburo, threatened to resign unless the
Nagorno-Karabakh issue is solved as soon as possible so that
Armenian lives in the region are protected, Tass and Interfax
reported.
   The president of Azerbaijan, Ayaz Mutalibov, also has accused
the Soviet authorities of inaction in the dispute, and he has
issued a different kind of threat _ that his republic may secede
from the Soviet Union if the Kremlin does not act to ``normalize
the situation'' in Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Mutalibov made the threat in an interview published Tuesday in
the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya.
   Movsisyan said a natural gas pipeline to Yerevan, Armenia's
capital, has been shut off, and freight trains have stopped
arriving in the city of Idzhevan, costing the republic tens of
millions of rubles.
   In addition, Azerbaijani authorities are forcing Armenians to
leave their homes in Nagorno-Karabakh, in order to change the
demography of the region, the Armenian parliament's resolution was
quoted by Tass as saying.
   The parliament urged that Interior Ministry and Soviet army
troops be deployed immediately along the borders of
Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent areas to restore Soviet authority and
self-government in the area, Tass reported.
   Last week, the Armenian parliament banned the Armenian National
Army, created last winter as a vigilante group to protect the
mostly Christian population of Armenia from the mostly Moslem
population of Azerbaijan. Lawmakers acted after the militant
nationalist group was blamed for the shooting deaths of a member of
parliament and another man.
   Gorbachev has demanded that militants in the republic disarm and
disband paramilitary groups, but Armenian leaders say they can
police their own population.

<HEAD>Solidarity Denies Newspaper's Right to Use Union Logo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leaders decided Wednesday to
bar Poland's biggest daily newspaper from displaying the union's
logo in another move that reflects the deepening split in the labor
movement's ranks.
   The trade union's National Commission at its weekly meeting in
Gdansk voted 26-21 with 12 abstentions to take away the union logo
from the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper. A newspaper spokeswoman later
said it would comply with the decision.
   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa was not present for the vote.
   Walesa in June questioned the use of the logo by Gazeta
Wyborcza, which is published by a private company. The newspaper
was the first independent daily to be published legally in Poland
after decades of Communist rule.
   The editor-in-chief, Adam Michnik, defended the daily's right to
use the logo at that time.
   Michnik, a historian and longtime adviser to Walesa, stressed in
a June 6 editorial that the daily was a direct continuation of the
union's underground press.
   After Wednesday's vote, Solidarity's national spokeswoman
Barbara Malak announced she was resigning to protest the
leadership's decision.
   ``The logo was treated as a censorship tool directed against the
press and other media. I had to decide whether or not to accept my
job as spokeswoman when it comes to using censorship,'' Ms. Malak
told the PAP news agency.
   Alina Bialkowska, a senior editor reached at Gazeta's office,
said the newspaper would remove the Solidarity logo and publish a
statement by the editorial staff on Thursday.
   ``The newspaper will remain the same _ independent _ like it has
been all the time,'' she said.
   Gazeta Wyborcza was founded in May 1989 as a result of the
round-table agreements that restored Solidarity's legal status. The
union was banned by Communist authorities after the December 1981
martial law crackdown.
   Early editions of the newspaper focused on elections to
parliament in which Solidarity scored easy victories.
   Although generally supportive of Solidarity, the daily has
ceased to be a union mouthpiece since the creation of a
non-Communist government a year ago. It has defended the policies
of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and taken a lukewarm attitude
toward Walesa's ambitions to become Poland's president.
   Michnik is a leader of the Citizens Movement for Democratic
Action, a recently formed Solidarity-related political group that
supports Mazowiecki. The staff of Gazeta Wyborcza denies it is
aligned with the group.

   The parents of a tourist from Utah who was
stabbed to death in a subway mugging testified to a grand jury
Wednesday before heading home for the funeral.
   Sherwin and Karen Watkins looked tired and pained as they
entered Manhattan Criminal Court shortly before noon to testify
about how their son, Brian, was stabbed to death chasing youths who
robbed his father.
   The couple, escorted by detectives from the district attorney's
office, did not speak to reporters.
   Mrs. Watkins left the courtroom about 90 minutes later and
bought a newspaper to read while her husband testified. Reporters
who tried to speak with her were blocked by a burly man who said,
``They don't want to talk to the press.''
   The family plans to hold a news conference Thursday afternoon
after their return to Provo, Utah, according to David G. Hansen,
the family's Mormon bishop.
   Funeral services for Brian Watkins were scheduled for Saturday
in Provo.
   On Sunday, the 22-year-old tennis buff, his parents, his
brother, Todd, and Todd's wife, Michelle, had been at the U.S. Open
in Queens and were waiting for a train in a midtown subway station
at around 10:20 p.m. when they were attacked.
   The family was approached by a group of youths who sliced open
Sherwin Watkins' pants and took a money clip containing about $200
and some credit cards. One punched Mrs. Watkins in the face.
   The brothers interceded and Brian was stabbed, but started to
give chase before collapsing. He died 40 minutes later.
   The youths robbed the Watkinses because they wanted money to go
dancing at the nearby Roseland Ballroom, police said.
   The grand jury was considering charges of second-degree murder
and first-degree assault against eight youths, including Yull Garry
Morales, 18, who police accuse of stabbing Watkins.
   The eight, who pleaded not guilty at their arraignment, were
ordered held without bail. A return court date was set for Friday,
said Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for the Manhattan district
attorney.
   Besides Morales, the suspects were identified by police as
Anthony Anderson, Pascal E. Carpenter, Emiliano Fernandez, Ricardo
Lopez, Johnny Hincapie and Ricardo Nova, all 18, and Luis Fernando
Montero, 22.
   A double-edged ``butterfly'' knife, believed to have been the
murder weapon, was recovered.
   The Queens youths belonged to a gang known as FTS _ an
abbreviation for an obscene phrase _ which required would-be
members to mug someone as an initiation rite, the New York Times
reported.
   Quoting former members of the gang, the Times said the gang
liked to rob people ``for the hell of it'' and had two passions:
graffiti and dancing.
   A city police spokesman, Lt. Raymond O'Donnell, said however
that the group was not known to the department's Youth Gang
Intelligence Unit. ``We never knew of them as being an organized
group. They may have been involved in graffiti in Queens.''

   Gov. James Blanchard chose Olivia Maynard,
head of the state's office on aging, as his running mate in a move
that could placate women and senior citizens angered when he dumped
78-year-old Lt. Gov. Martha Griffiths.
   The governor denied picking Maynard, 54, to mollify those
interest groups.
   The senior citizens' and women's groups told him they supported
his initial decision, Blanchard said. But he added that picking
Maynard will bring a ``new sense of enthusiasm'' about his
Democratic ticket.
   Amid the controversy, Blanchard's Republican opponent, Senate
Majority Leader John Engler, last week chose a state Sen. Connie
Binsfeld, 66, as his running mate. Her selection was expected to be
ratified at the GOP convention, which begins Friday in Detroit.
   Blanchard had a double-digit lead over Engler in a poll
conducted in late July.
   Blanchard, seeking his third four-year term, described Maynard
as a fighter for senior citizens and people living on fixed incomes.
   ``I trust her with power, I trust her with decisions, I trust
her ability to work and select good people and I trust her with the
future of this state,'' he said.
   Maynard was head of the Michigan Democratic Party from 1979 to
1983 and has been director of the state's Office of Services to the
Aging since March 1983.
   Blanchard, 48, announced Aug. 24 that he was replacing Griffiths
on the Democratic ticket after two terms because he didn't feel she
was ready to step in at any moment to take over as governor.
   The naming of his new running mate came one day after the crusty
former congresswoman and long-time fighter for women's rights said
she wouldn't oppose his decision at the state Democratic convention
this weekend in Flint.
   The convention, which begins Friday, must ratify Blanchard's
choice.
   Griffiths _ originally furious about Blanchard's decision _ also
denied a published report she called the governor a ``son of a
bitch'' last week. She said the reference was to politicans in
general who dump someone after getting what they want.
   She dodged a question about whether he falls into the same
category as other politicians, saying: ``You be the judge.''
   Griffiths is widely credited with helping Blanchard first gain
the governor's office in 1982.

<HEAD>Former Lottery Winner Found Crushed, Dead in Dump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who won $188,000 in Florida's lottery
last year will get a pauper's burial after he apparently was
crushed to death in a trash bin following a night of drinking.
   Police say Roy Clark may have spent all the money he won in a
Fantasy Five drawing, but on Wednesday they were looking for any
relatives in case some cash or property remained.
   ``Poof!'' said Orange County sheriff's detective Tom McCann. ``I
guess he just blew it.''
   When Clark's body _ compacted by a garbage truck _ was found
Friday at the Orange County dump, there was less than $10 in his
pocket. It was the last of $40 he made the previous day working for
a labor pool.
   Police said they didn't know whether Clark had anything left to
show from his winnings.
   Detectives know that Clark, 39, spent at least some of his money
buying rounds of drinks for friends and riding around in
limousines. They traced much of the money through several bank
accounts. He wrote checks for most of it from an account with
Barnett Bank in Tallahassee.
   They said they had heard he invested in several businesses and
that he bought a condominium in Hawaii and land in California.
   If true, those holdings would go to any heirs, but after nearly
a week of looking for his next of kin, police haven't found anyone.
   Friends said he carried a picture of a young girl he said was
his daughter, Brandy, whom he described as a student at the
University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. But when detectives
checked, they were told that no one named Brandy Clark was
registered there.
   When he hit the lottery last September, Clark had been working
for a sod company and living in an apartment building in Winter
Park. He had become friends with the family across the hall, Chuck
and Sandy Herbert.
   He moved away after hitting the lottery, and detectives said
they believe he was living with another man in a rented trailer in
east Orange County.
   In April, the Herberts said, Clark came to see them at their new
home. He told them he was having some legal problems getting his
winnings from the lottery and needed a place to stay.
   Until the week before he disappeared, Clark lived with the
Herberts and their three children. They find it hard to believe he
lied about not getting his winnings.
   ``He was a good man. He was always watching the kids for me. He
loved them,'' said Sandy Herbert. ``Every time I look here or
there, I can picture him holding the baby.''
   He enjoyed snorkeling and watching National Geographic nature
programs, she said. He didn't drink, carouse or take drugs, she
said.
   Clark told the Herberts he would be gone for a few days on a
business trip with his lawyer to try to get his lottery winnings.
   ``I can't see him leaving like that knowing he wasn't going to
come back,'' Sandy Herbert said. ``He had a home here. Whatever
happened to him in that week is the answer.''

   A forensic specialist said Wednesday
the three apartments where the bodies of five college students were
found ``the most difficult'' crime scenes he has ever seen.
   Dr. Michael West made the comment after hunting for fingerprints
at the apartments with high-tech equipment. West, a dentist and
deputy medical examiner from Hattiesburg, Miss., said the
apartments gave clues of a careful, cautious killer.
   ``I've never been associated with a crime scene that had so many
violent attacks and so litle evidence left behind,'' West said.
``This individual that perpetrated these crimes is not your average
criminal. He's very methodical, and very neat. He doesn't leave any
traces of his presence in the crime scenes.''
   Students in Gainesville remembered their dead classmates at a
memorial service in a 10,000-seat sports center. Also Wednesday,
the University of Florida announced scholarships in memory of the
students.
   Three of the victims were students at the University of Florida
and two were from Santa Fe Community College. One of the two later
enrolled in the university but hadn't attended classes. Their
bodies were found late last month.
   ``We are struggling with the conflicting emotions of grief,
anger and fear,'' college President John Lombardi told about 600
people attending the memorial service.
   Dr. Larry W. Tyree, president of Santa Fe Community College,
said: ``With each horrible tragedy ... the sense of helplessness
has grown in each of us.''
   As the grisly job of examining evidence and looking for a killer
continued, investigators divulged more brief glimpses into what
they have learned about the crimes.
   West used an experimental reflective ultraviolet imaging system
that intensifies light 70,000 times to examine two of the three
crime scenes Tuesday for fingerprints; he returned Wednesday to
look at the final apartment.
   The Miami Herald on Wednesday quoted sources as saying the
killer cruelly posed his victims for maximum shock value.
   The killer placed Santa Fe Community College student Christa
Hoyt's severed head in the direct line of vision of anyone entering
the apartment and positioned a mirror in one of the apartments to
show a victim's body to any passerby who happened to look in the
window, the Herald reported.
   The killer also reportedly poured bleach onto the genitals of
the four female victims in an apparent attempt to confuse
investigators about whether the women were sexually assaulted, the
newspaper said. Police would not confirm the report.
   Fluids removed from the murder scenes are being subjected to
sophisticated DNA testing. Those tests are to be completed in a few
days.
   The bodies of Sonja Larson, 18, and Christina Powell, 17, were
found Aug. 26. The body of Miss Hoyt, 19, was found the next day;
the bodies of Tracy Paules, 23, and Manuel Taboada, 23, were found
Aug. 28.
   ``This is the most difficult crime scene I've ever seen,'' said
West, who has been a medical examiner for 13 years.
   He said he's been able to turn up some fingerprints ``but the
odds are they belonged to the residents'' of the apartments. He
said he hasn't been able to find any prints ``on the areas we
believe the perpetrator to have touched, moved or manipulated.''
   Despite the filing of unrelated new charges in Indian River
County against Edward Lewis Humphrey for armed burglary and
attempted sexual battery, police said it has not affected his
position on their pool of eight suspects.
   ``An arrest is not imminent'' in the slayings, said Lt. Spencer
Mann, a spokesman with the Alachua County Sheriff's Office. ``We
still have no timetable on arrests or legal options.''
   Only Humphrey and Stephen Michael Bates, a 30-year-old Lakeland
short-order cook, have been publicly mentioned as being on the list.
   Bates has been held in the Polk County Jail on $100,500 bond
since his Aug. 29 arrest in an unrelated assault case.
   Police in Dothan, Ala., also have contacted Gainesville police
about the May stabbing death of Marilyn Mitchell, a nursing
graduate from the University of Alabama, to see if that case is
related.
   Polk County authorities have said they doubt Bates is the
killer, but his fingerprints have been sent to the task force
investigating the slayings.
   Humphrey faces the new charges after he was identified by a
27-year-old woman as the man who attacked her at knifepoint in
1988. She called police after seeing Humphrey's picture in a
newspaper.
   ``He said something or did something in this case that is very
similar to characteristics of the suspect in Gainesville,'' said
Lt. Mary Lenz of the Indian River County Sheriff's Office.

   A Bronze Age sword nearly 3,000 years old
has been found in an Irish bog by a workman, the National Museum in
Dublin said Wednesday.
   Jim Kelly was working at the Littleton Bog in County Tipperary
when he saw something sticking out of what had been the timbers of
an ancient roadway, said Michael Ryan, the museum's expert.
   When Kelly tapped it with his boot the sword fell out, Ryan said.
   He said the sword was made of cast bronze and dates to the
Bronze Age about 2,700 or 2,800 years ago.
   ``It's quite small but beautifully made and still very sharp and
in very good condition, except for a little bit of surface
corrosion,'' Ryan said.
   A team from the museum is now exploring the site.
   Ryan said bronze objects preserve well in bogs and several
spearheads were found earlier in Littleton Bog.

   Cries for help by tens of thousands of
hungry Asians stranded in Jordan after fleeing Kuwait are finally
being heard by other nations, but there still were concerns
Wednesday that the aid could come too late.
   The multitudes, now living in makeshift desert camps, are
fighting for food and water, and many are on the verge of
starvation.
   Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan chided the international community
earlier this week for its slow response to his government's pleas
for aid.
   The International Organiztion for Migration announced Wednesday
it would begin an airlift Thursday to evacuate 19,000 people over
the next two weeks. It said it planned 72 flights at a cost of
about $12 million.
   Foreign correspondents visiting the stinking camp at Salwa, near
Ruweishid on the Jordanian-Iraqi border, were surrounded by hordes
of bedraggled Bangladeshis and other Asian nationals pleading for
deliverance from the blazing desert.
   ``Tell the world we will die here if we are not helped,'' was
one of the anguished cries heard over and over in the camp on an
expanse of stony desert.
   About 40,000 Asians are packed into the Salwa camp, which lacks
basic sanitary and other amenities.
   Some are crammed into tents, but shelter for most is a woman's
sari spread overhead to provide some shade from the fierce sun. The
severe food shortage has forced people to fight over scraps of
bread.
   The official Jordanian news agency Petra said Wednesday 605,277
evacuees had crossed into Jordan since Aug. 2, when the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait sparked the exodus of foreigners from the two
countries.
   The vast majority of evacuees have left Jordan, but 105,000
Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Indians, Sri Lankans, Thais and Filipinos
are stranded in camps scattered throughout Jordan, waiting for
transportation home, Petra said.
   Nearly 20,000 more cross into Jordan every day, but only half
that number leave daily, the agency said.
   The West German government announced Tuesday it had dispatched
an 167-seat aircraft that over the past 10 days evacuated 6,000
Egyptian nationals stranded at Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba.
   Sweden, Denmark and Norway on Wednesday together pledged $14
million in aid; Finland pledged $2.5 million and Italy $3.4 million.
   The United Nations already has sent more than 3,000 metric tons
of food and other supplies to Jordan, and received $19 million in
aid, mainly from Japan and Sweden, said Robert Souria, a relief
official with the agency.
   But he added, ``The international community needs to send more.''
   Jordan's American-born Queen Noor hugged and kissed British
tycoon Richard Branson when he flew into the Amman airport Tuesday
night aboard a jumbo jet of his Virgin Atlantic Airline laden with
40 tons of supplies for the 100,000 stranded Asians on the verge of
starvation.
   ``We are so grateful, we desperately needed this,'' the queen
told Branson.
   Branson flew back to London with a planeload of Western women
and children hostages who had been allowed to leave Iraq.
   ``There is a tremendous amount of concentration on a few British
and a few American people coming out'' of Iraq, Branson told
reporters.
   ``I feel it is slightly embarrassing being there with a big
plane and there is a refugee camp 10 minutes away with thousands
and thousands of people from India and Bangladesh, who may be
waiting for months to get out.''
   He said relief efforts should be coordinated by European nations
to ensure that all aircraft arrive full of provisions and tents,
and return full of Westerners.

   U.S. business leaders picked to go to the
Soviet Union with Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher this weekend
represent some of the areas where the Soviets need the most help,
such as housing and transportation.
   Mosbacher and 15 chief executive officers of U.S. companies are
scheduled to leave for Moscow on Saturday for a week-long visit to
discuss what kind of ``technical assistance'' the United States can
give the Soviet Union.
   During the trip, they plan to meet with Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Republic,
said an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Bush administration, while balking at providing the Soviet
Union with cash grants or loans, agreed at the economic summit of
industrial nations in Houston in July to provide the technical
assistance.
   About 80 other nations receive American technical assistance,
which can range from developing a fly-resistant wheat in Morocco to
bringing down Bangladesh's fertility rate.
   The Soviets need help with improving their transportation
infrastructure and housing, said business leaders who will make the
trip.
   ``Big chunks of money are not what they want. They want to have
the exposure to the management techniques and construction
techniques and operating techniques that we take for granted,''
said Mark Hungerford, chairman and chief executive officer of
Tanscisco Industries Inc. of San Francisco, a rail car company.
   Hungerford's company, for example, is engaged in a joint venture
with the Soviets to help them with a heating system for tank rail
cars that performs well in cold climates. His firm also is helping
the Soviets to better transport petrochemical products.
   Another transportation firm _ Sea-Land Service Inc., of Edison,
N.J. _ will be represented by its chief officer, Alex J. Mandl.
Sea-Land specializes in ``global distribution networks,'' or
establishing a way for goods to be transported by land and sea.
   The trip, Mandl said, gives him a chance to help both President
Bush and his company.
   ``That part of the world is opening up. As long as the Iron
Curtain was up, our distribution network did not participate in
that part of the world. As that wall comes down, we have a chance
to be in there,'' Mandl said.
   Leonard Sylk, chairman and chief executive officer of Shelter
Systems Group of Hainesport, N.J., said the Soviets have been
interested in his firm's expertise because it makes manufactured
housing components, or the roofs, floors and walls that large-scale
builders use in putting up houses.
   U.S. business leaders stand to gain if the Soviet economy
improves, Sylk said.
   Other companies to be represented on the trip are, according to
government sources: the Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. of Decatur,
Ill.; Atlantic Richfield Co. of Los Angeles; the Chevron Corp., of
San Francisco; Dresser Industries of Dallas; Fortune Magazine of
New York; Glenair International of Del Mar, Calif.; The Louisiana
Land and Exploration Co. of New Orleans; PaineWebber of New York;
Pepsico Inc. of Purchase, N.Y.; Pruet Oil Co., of El Dorado, Ark.;
Texaco Inc., of White Plains N.Y., and United Telecommunications of
Westwood, Kan.

   Irene Dunne filled the screen like a good
vintage champagne in a Baccarat crystal goblet.
   She was bubbly, of course. But like that fine champagne, hers
were small, neat bubbles compacted with years of flavor and refined
ever so to explode not all at once but slowly and smoothly and
surely.
   Dunne, who died Tuesday night in her Los Angeles home at 88, was
one of the last of that great breed of film actors who delighted
generations with those romantic frolics known as screwball comedies.
   Her portrayals were spontaneous, unexpected, flirty and winsome.
They were tantalizing, frothy and intelligent. Above all, they were
downright funny. She may have liked her dramatic roles more (``I
Remember Mama,'' ``Magnificent Obsession''), but comedy made her a
legend.
   She had an offhanded but charming way of delivering lines in a
voice that sounded like sable brushing diamonds. Hers was not the
clipped, patrician charm of Katharine Hepburn, or the coquettish
zaniness of Carole Lombard. Her timing was better in a way. Ask her
a question and she could say more with a turn of her head and a
simple, ``Ahh,'' than with a long answer or even a ``yes'' or
``no.''
   ``Cary (Grant) paid me one of the loveliest compliments of my
life,'' she once remarked. ``He said I had the best timing of
anyone he ever worked with. It must be something that comes
naturally to you. My father had a keen sense of humor, which I
think is different from having a sense of humor.''
   Timing _ and attitude.
   ``It's not that I'm prudish. It's just that my mother told me
never to enter any man's room in months ending in `r,' '' she tells
Charles Boyer in ``Love Affair,'' a 1939 movie later made into ``An
Affair to Remember,'' with Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant.
   In ``The Awful Truth,'' Leo McCarey's Academy Award-nominated
crazy romp about a divorcing couple who scheme to get back
together, Dunne (Lucy Warriner) turns the table on co-star Cary
Grant (Jerry Warriner) in the classic Lola scene.
   She shows up as Jerry's alleged stripper-sister, Lola, at a
formal dinner party given by his terribly proper fiancee and her
terribly proper family. With an outfit that would make a
streetwalker proud, Dunne swings into a stripper number she had
seen Jerry's girlfriend of the moment, Dixiebelle, perform in a
nightclub. Dixiebelle had a fan blow her skirts above her head
during certain lyrics in the song.
   Lucy sings ``My Dreams Have Gone With the Wind'' _ and Dunne,
who had a trained lyric soprano voice, butchers her singing talents
in the most vulgar but funny ways:
   ``I used to dream about a cottage small
   A cottage small by the waterfall
   But I wound up with no dreams at all
   My dreams have gone with the wind.''
   There is no fan as Lucy performs the embarrassing number.
Instead, she makes the wind sounds herself and spreads her legs
apart. ``This song has some wind effects in it, but you'll just
have to use your imagination about them,'' she coos.
   Earlier in the movie, Lucy and Jerry have a courtroom custody
battle for their wire-haired terrier, Mr. Smith. Dunne, with an
all-knowing and alluring smile at the judge, hides the dog's
favorite squeaky toy in her fur muff. He runs to her to prove whom
he prefers.
   Love wins out, as it always does in these situations, despite
Dunne's chilling promise to Grant: ``I wouldn't go on living with
you if you were dipped in platinum.''
   Dunne and Grant have another wonderful romp in Garson Kanin's
``My Favorite Wife,'' in which Dunne returns home after being
shipwrecked and presumed dead for a number of years. She's spent
the time with Randolph Scott, and Grant has remarried.
   ``How long does it take to tell a woman, `My wife's come back?'
I can say it in two seconds. `My wife's come back.' You've had two
days,'' she snaps at him.
   She also asks, ``Oh, by the way, how was my funeral?''
   But the urbane charms drop ever so slightly in ``Life With
Father.'' Here, Dunne is understanding, loving and the all-knowing
wife to William Powell's irascible husband.
   ``You know,'' Dunne tells Zasu Pitts in the movie, ``I don't
believe Clare has come right out and told me he loves me since
we've been married. 'Course, I know he does because I keep
reminding him of it. You have to keep reminding them.''
   Grant loved working with Dunne and once summed up the delightful
effects of her performance: He called it a lovely flirtation.

   Czechoslovakian leader Alexander Dubcek
feasted on sausages and potato dumplings Wednesday and told
residents of a town founded by Czech immigrants they were like
``members of my family.''
   ``I am glad that many of you have found a new mother country in
the United States,'' the president of the Czechoslovakian
parliament told a crowd of about 1,200 _ half the population of the
southern Minnesota farming community.
   Children chanted ``Dubcek, Dubcek!'' and waved Czechoslovakian
and American flags.
   ``I am especially glad that the new generation that is here does
not forget the old country,'' he said through a translator.
   In an effort to inject life into Czechoslovakia's sagging
economy, a six-member delegation including top ministers of
industry and science is visiting Minnesota to learn about medical
and computer technology.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made a one-day visit to
the state in June for similar reasons.
   Dubcek met with about 100 health care executives Tuesday at
Medtronic Inc., the world's largest maker of cardiac pacemakers, in
the Minneapolis suburb of Fridley.
   Dubcek said at a luncheon address Wednesday that the shift from
a planned economy to a free market system will progress slowly and
painfully over several years.
   ``Destruction of the totalitarian power is not enough,'' he
said. ``It is necessary to rebuild the economic structure from
scratch. We want to avoid the danger of excess inflation that has
so badly hit our neighbors in Poland and Hungary.''
   That can be spurred by foreign investment and joint ventures
with American entrepreneurs, the Czechoslovakian leader said.
   ``Our industry is considerably sound, even if some of our
industrial branches may be obsolete,'' he said. ``We have qualified
workers and technicians who are experienced. We have a relatively
low foreign debt.''
   Earlier, Dubcek joined local and state officials for breakfast
at Schumacher's New Prague Hotel. They ate the Czech sausage
Jiternice with horseradish, along with biscuits, potato dumplings
and scrambled eggs.
   Dubcek, now 68, was led the 1968 Prague Spring liberalization
movement that was crushed by Warsaw Pact forces. Last year, he
regained his post as head of parliament following two decades of
political exile and relative obscurity.
   He told a crowd gathered on the steps of the St. Wenceslaus
Church in New Prague that his years of struggle were worth the
ultimate freedoms gained by his countrymen when they forced out the
communist government.
   ``As the lessons of history say, `violence can never last
forever,' '' he said. ``Truth and justice will come _ sometimes
later _ but it will always come. ... the best witness of that is my
good mood as I talk to you here.
   ``I can tell you frankly that to be here, I feel I am among
members of my family,'' he said.
   New Prague was founded by Czech immigrants in the 1870s. More
than 500,000 people with Eastern Europe roots live in Minnesota.
   State House Speaker Robert Vanasek, of New Prague, called Dubcek
``the greatest Slovak of the 20th century.''

<TEXT>
   Richard V. Secord testified Wednesday that a
former CIA agent shared in Iran-Contra arms sale profits, but that
records of the weapons deals ``were cooked'' after the scandal
became public.
   The retired Air Force major general was the lead-off witness in
the government's tax case against Thomas G. Clines, the retired CIA
agent who is accused of under-reporting some of his arms sale
earnings on his 1985 and 1986 tax returns.
   The trial in U.S. District Court focuses on profits during the
Iran-Contra affair, which involved the sale of arms to Iran and
efforts to supply weapons to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua at a
time when Congress banned such assistance.
   Clines, 62, of Middleburg, Va., also is charged with failing to
tell the Internal Revenue Service about overseas financial
accounts. If convicted, he faces up to 16 years in prison and fines
of up to $1 million.
   Secord pleaded guilty last year to a felony count of making
false statements to the Iran-Contra congressional committees. He
was sentenced in January to two years' probation.
   Secord said he asked Clines in early 1985 to help obtain weapons
for the rebels fighting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
   Secord said Clines agreed. ``He managed the procurement,'' he
said. ``He used his contacts in the Communist East Bloc of Europe
and western part of Europe to procure the infantry weapons that
were needed.''
   Clines often worked out of a ``closet office'' in Lisbon,
Portugal, he said.
   Clines initially received 20 percent of the profits, and began
receiving 30 percent in 1986, Secord said. The remaining shares
went to Secord, Iranian-born businessman Albert Hakim and various
companies, the general testified.
   Prosecutors claim Clines received about $882,000 in commissions
in the arms deals. Some of the money was kept in a Swiss bank
account code-named ``C. Tea,'' the prosecutors said.
   Clines reported gross earnings of $265,000 for the tax year 1985
and $402,513 for 1986, according to a four-count indictment
returned Feb. 22 in Baltimore.
   Secord said he couldn't remember much about the C. Tea account.
   ``I have a vague recollection that he (Clines) said there was
such an account,'' Secord testified. ``I'm not sure Clines said
anything to me about its purpose.
   According to the congressional Iran-Contra report issued in
1987, the account was managed at a Geneva-based firm called
Compagnie de Services Fiduciare, or CSF.
   Secord said he believed the CSF records were altered sometime
after Congress began investigating the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``I believe the CSF ledgers were cooked,'' Secord said. ``I
believe they were falsified in some respects.''
   But when asked whether he had ever seen a forged document
relating to Clines' profits, Secord said, ``I don't believe so.''
   Under questioning from defense attorney Paula M. Junghans,
Secord testified that Clines was not a shareholder, officer or
director of any of the companies set up to channel Iran-Contra arms
money.
   Rafael ``Chi Chi'' Quintero, a former contract agent for the CIA
who began working for the Iran-Contra operation in early 1985,
testified for the government under a grant of immunity.
   Quintero said Clines once told him that he had earned roughly
$700,000 during the affair. He said he later overheard Clines tell
his lawyer on the telephone that he had earned $750,000.
   Under cross-examination, however, Quintero testified that he did
not know if the figures referred to gross earnings or what Clines
had made after expenses or taxes.
   In her opening remarks, Junghans said Clines got involved in the
affair because he was sympathetic to the Contras and it was an
opportunity to make some money.
   ``There is no charge in this case that says it's a crime to buy
and sell arms,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Wednesday urged
forgiveness and reconciliation in this central African nation with
a history of tribal warfare and repression of Roman Catholics.
   He also said the AIDS virus, which has ravaged Africa, was a
moral issue that calls for changes in sexual behavior. The church
condemns the use of condoms to check the spread of the deadly
disease.
   The pope said the church has a duty to assist AIDS sufferers
with health care and moral support. ``These people often tend to
close themselves in an anguished silence,'' he said.
   The pope, who flew to the predominantly Catholic country from
Tanzania, spoke on his arrival of the nation's tribal wars,
``trials that have scarred your people, dragged into conflicts
which have torn your communities and wounded too many families.''
   ``Now the path of reconciliation and harmony has opened before
you,'' he said. ``You have made a beginning. Speed up the pace, and
may no one hesitate to rediscover the fraternal path so that your
hills never again experience division and violence.''
   Burundi, a small mountainous nation of 6 million people which
gained independence from Belgium in 1962, has suffered from a
conflict between the Tutsi and Hutu tribes. Some 300,000 people,
most of them Hutus, were killed in ethnic massacres 18 years ago.
Violence exploded again in 1988, with at least 5,000 people killed
in tribal fighting.
   In May, President Pierre Buyoya unveiled a charter saying his
minority Tutsi tribe was preparing to share power with the majority
Hutus.
   ``Hear my appeal,'' the pope said in French at the Bujumbura
airport, where he was greeted by Buyoya. ``Consolidate your unity,
not with resignation or fear, but rooting it solidly with
reconciliation and forgiveness...your total reconciliation does not
mean forgetting the past. You must look at it with truth. You must
rediscover and overcome together that which divided you so that you
can build a new life.''
   The pope also hailed the ``cordial relations of mutual respect''
between church and state in Burundi, where about two-thirds of the
people are Catholics.
   Under the previous regime of Col. Jean-Baptiste Bagaza,
overthrown in a coup three years ago, missionaries were expelled,
Catholic schools closed and weekday church services banned. Buyoya
has restored full freedom for the church.
   Earlier in Moshi, Tanzania, John Paul celebrated Mass at the
foot of Mount Kilimanjaro and implored rich countries to forge a
``new era of solidarity with Africa.''
   ``Let the world not forget the urgent needs of Africa,'' he said.
   About 40,000 people attended the pope's Mass in Kilimanjaro
Stadium, the former cricket and polo grounds of British rulers. As
John Paul arrived in the popemobile, clouds that had obscured the
19,300-foot snowy peak of Africa's tallest mountain cleared.
   Gifts for the pope included a stuffed lion brought to the altar
by a Masai Moran, or warrior, dressed in the tribe's traditional
toga-like robe of red and blue.
   The pope, on his seventh visit to Africa, will also travel to
Rwanda and the Ivory Coast, where he ends his tour Monday by
consecrating the massive basilica of Our Lady of Peace.

<HEAD>Freed Hostage: Concern for Arabs is Misunderstood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teacher who was held hostage for six days in
Iraq says her concern for Arabs is being misinterpreted as
anti-American sentiment.
   Elizabeth Krekeler, a former Peace Corps volunteer who arrived
at her home in Webster Groves late Sunday, said she has received
two telephone calls from people angry about her statements on the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Krekeler has said she feels no bitterness toward Iraq or its
leader, President Saddam Hussein, and that she opposes an embargo
on shipments of food to Iraq.
   Krekeler, 50, said Tuesday she was expressing her concern for
the welfare of the average Iraqi citizen. She added that she
opposes Saddam's Aug 2 invasion of Kuwait, which touched off the
U.S. military buildup in neighboring Saudi Arabia.
   ``I'm not a political person. I was over there to teach English
and to build bridges for peace,'' Krekeler said. In Iraq, ``the
average person on the street likes the United States. They're not
political either.''
   Krekeler was among 47 American hostages released on Sunday by
Iraq and flown to the United States. Regarding her six-day stint as
a hostage, Krekeler said she ``felt like a political pawn.''
   Krekeler arrived in Baghdad on July 22 to take a job teaching
English to Iraqi adults at the American Cultural Center, set up by
the federally financed U.S. Information Service. She had just
finished a two-year stint with the Peace Corps in Morocco.
   She said she plans to spend a few months visiting friends and
family, and probably will look for work as a substitute teacher
until she makes more permanent plans. Her goal is to find another
teaching job overseas.
   ``I would like to go back there and build bridges,'' Krekeler
said. ``I want to teach English and bring people closer together.''

   A judge on Wednesday denied a $3.5 million
wrongful death claim by the widow of Sen. John East, who contended
that government doctors' failure to diagnose a thyroid disorder
drove her husband to suicide.
   The first-term Republican killed himself June 19, 1986, by
running his car in the closed garage of his Greenville, N.C., home.
He left a suicide note blaming his doctors, saying, ``they ruined
my life.''
   Priscilla East, contended in her wrongful death lawsuit that
Navy doctors, who provide care for members of Congress, were slow
to detect her 55-year-old husband's thyroid condition. The suit
said the delay triggered severe depression that led to the
senator's suicide.
   U.S. District Judge Walter Black, who heard the case without a
jury, ruled against Mrs. East.
   ``This is a truly tragic case,'' Black wrote in his opinion.
``However, the court has determined ... that the medical care
rendered by the government doctors, while clearly not perfect, does
not establish liability in this case.''
   Ira Oring, the assistant U.S. Attorney who represented the
government, said: ``The physicians have had to live with a cloud
over their careers for some period of time. Essentially they have
been vindicated and we're very happy for them.''
   Terri Steinhaus, an attorney representing Mrs. East, said the
lawyers believe ``the court's decision is unsupported by the
evidence.''
   Ms. Steinhaus said Mrs. East had no comment on the decision. She
also said no decision has been reached on whether an appeal will be
filed.
   The case was heard in Baltimore because that is the seat of the
judicial district that includes Bethesda Naval Medical Center.

   His late father's dream of a headquarters for
the nation's largest black church is the jewel in the crown in the
reign of the Rev. T.J. Jemison as president of the National Baptist
Convention U.S.A. Inc.
   ``That must be our Vatican. That must be our center of
strength,'' Jemison said as he cajoled, pleaded for funds at the
denomination's 110th annual meeting for the $10 million World
Baptist Center some critics say is a monument to one man's ego.
   The center, with its 162-foot spire, 3,000-seat auditorium and
300-seat choir loft, was dedicated with great fanfare in June 1989
in Nashville, Tenn. With the Rev. Jesse Jackson at his side,
Jemison said he was the ``instrument called by God'' to build the
headquarters envisioned by his father, D.V. Jemison.
   For others, it revives the age-old controversy of whether church
money should be spent on buildings or people.
   ``It is a travesty when we see the problems of drug abuse,
teen-age parenting'' and other social ills, said Cain Felder,
professor of New Testament at Howard Divinity School at Howard
University and the author of ``Troubling Biblical Waters: Race,
Class and Family.''
   Even critics concede the headquarters _ the first one of its
kind ever for a black church body _ is a tribute to the remarkable
charismatic powers of Jemison.
   His father, elected president of the Baptist convention in 1941,
was not able to realize his dream of giving the denomination an
architectural monument of its own. Blind and in failing health, the
Rev. D.V. Jemison was forced out of office by the Rev. Joseph H.
Jackson in 1953, but not before he ensured his son was installed as
general secretary of the denomination.
   T.J. Jemison had to wait 29 years before Jackson would be ousted
from office, but he almost immediately set out to build a
headquarters that would rival the buildings long taken for granted
by most predominantly white denominations.
   In so doing, he may have permanently altered the way the
denomination's 32,000 churches give financial support to the 7.8
million-member Baptist convention, which refers to itself as the
largest black organization in the world.
   Jemison has made it clear annual contributions as low as $50
would no longer be acceptable, and has tried to recruit 100,000
``Baptist builders'' to give at least $10 a month to pay off the $7
million still owed on the building.
   On Tuesday, Jemison devoted half of the denomination's board of
directors meeting to taking up a collection for the center, raising
half of the $1 million fund-raising goal he set for the annual
meeting.
   Jemison continued fund-raising at the general convention
Wednesday.
   ``Don't walk around with the money in your pocket,'' Jemison
told the delegates. ``Don't get too happy and keep it to Friday.''
   Felder said the center, with its ``palatial'' offices and
prominently displayed portraits of Jemison, is a symbol of how the
denomination has not fulfilled its potential for social change as
the nation's largest black institution.
   ``It is a sleeping giant that tends to remain asleep. When it
tends to wake up, it is filled with gross overindulgence,'' Felder
said.
   Forrest Harris, director of the Kelly Miller Smith Institute on
the Black Church at Vanderbilt Divinity School, said Jemison has a
clear agenda for addressing social problems. But he said the jury
is still out on Jemison's administration ``because so much energy
has been invested in the building of the World Baptist Center.''
   Even while raising funds, Jemison concedes he has his
detractors. But he contends the center will be a catalyst for
social action, including being a place where the homeless, drug
abusers and people afflicted with AIDS will be cared for.
   The headquarters is a symbol of new independence for National
Baptists, Jemison said.
   ``It's not for Jemison. It's not my ploy,'' he said Tuesday as a
steady stream of delegates brought up checks from their
congregations. ``It's something we should have had a long time
ago.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Upholds Ruling Blocking Execution of Convicted
Murderer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday
upheld a state ruling blocking the execution of a convicted
murderer who contends his confession was coerced by a sheriff who
is now a congressman.
   Barry Lee Fairchild, 36, had been scheduled to die Wednesday
night by injection, but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted
3-0 Tuesday to send the case to U.S. District Court for a hearing
on the allegations he was beaten by the sheriff and his deputies.
That hearing was scheduled for Nov. 13.
   U.S. Rep. Tommy Robinson has denied that, as sheriff, he and his
Pulaski County deputies beat Fairchild and five other black
suspects and urged them to confess to the 1983 abduction, rape and
murder of Air Force nurse Marjorie ``Greta'' Mason.
   On Wednesday he released a statement criticizing the justice
system and the defense: ``These legal maneuvers could go on for
years. The time has come for Congress to limit the number of
appeals that can be filed by those on death rows across the
country. ...
   ``The rights of Barry Lee Fairchild were never violated,'' the
statement continued. ``He abducted, raped and murdered a young lady
who had been in our state for only 10 days. He has had appeal after
appeal. At some point, all of us must step back and say `enough.'''
   The congressman was elected as a Democrat but switched to the
Republican party. He lost the GOP primary for governor this year
and isn't seeking re-election to the House.
   The high court ruling to uphold the stay of execution was
unanimous, said Supreme Court press officer Toni House.
   Fairchild's attorneys say he is mildly retarded, with an IQ
between the 60s and 80s, and contend he was easy prey for
authorities seeking to force a confession. He confessed twice but
later said the statements were coerced.
   His lawyers also contend that someone else confessed to the
murder and that police dropped the man as a suspect because he
provided few details about the crime.
   Defense attorneys say they have interviewed four men who say
they, too, were beaten and threatened with racial epithets by
deputies investigating the case.
   On Wednesday, Assistant Attorney General Jack Gillean confirmed
that three of the four men who submitted affidavits about the
alleged beatings were suspects in the murder. He said they were
questioned by police days before Fairchild was arrested and
questioned.
   Defense attorney John Wesley Hall said the fact that police had
other suspects wasn't revealed to his client's trial counsel. The
information could have helped convince the jury that ``police
rounded up blacks and beat on them until they elected which one was
the best one to be charged,'' Hall said.
   Gillean said he had no reason to believe the information was
withheld.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
Wednesday renewed his call for a holy war against the huge Western
military presence, and said U.N. sanctions could kill Iraqi
children.
   He also urged Arabs to rise up and overthrow leaders aligned
against him, singling out Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, formerly close allies.
   Saddam has previously called for a holy war, or jihad, but his
speech read by a spokesman over Baghdad television Wednesday was
his most virulent attack on Arab leaders who sided with Western
powers after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   An earlier translation from Saddam's Arabic speech, carried by
The Associated Press, incorrectly stated that Saddam said some
children were dying because of the sanctions.
   ``The children of Iraq are dying,'' that translation said.
   However, the Arabic text carried by the official Iraqi News
Agency did not contain that quote.
   In the broadcast speech, monitored in Cyprus, Saddam appeared to
reject foreign help to circumvent the U.N. embargo, assistance for
which his government had previously appealed on humanitarian
grounds.
   ``Have you, O brothers, known throughout the history that you
have come across that anyone tried to starve a nation to death by
depriving it of food?'' said Saddam.
   ``And have you witnessed in the history that is known to you
that some children should die because of a premeditated decision to
deprive them of milk?
   ``The children of Iraq, before the rest of the nation, refuse
that we beg for the milk which they need from the infidels and
shameless.''
   Saddam reiterated that Iraq would defy the boycott and would be
victorious, even against the advanced military technology arrayed
against it.
   He said the people are ``ready to sacrifice'' and do without.
   Saddam is holding an estimated 20,000 Westerners and has
deployed some Western men as human shields to deter attack on vital
military and civilian installations within Iraq.
   He has warned that any shortages among Iraq's civilian
population caused by the U.N.-imposed embargo would be applied
equally to foreign children and elderly persons being detained.
   In the past, Saddam has bragged that his nation could withstand
the sanctions, a claim made in tandem with Iraqi attempts to
convince some embargo nations to wink at the sanctions and resume
trade with Iraq.
   Jordan, a close ally of Iraq, has agreed to go along with
sanctions, but has so far rejected full-scale compliance on the
grounds that international law might forbid blocking food and
medicine from Iraq.
   Referring to the Egyptian and Saudi people, Saddam said ``We
call on them to revolt against the traitors . . . and fight the
presence in the Holy Land (of the Western multinational force).
   ``We call upon all Arabs, within the teachings of Allah and
according to the Moslem Holy War of Jihad, to fight this U.S.
presence of non-believers and to fight the stance taken by Arab
agents who have followed these foreigners,'' said Saddam in the
broadcast.
   The Western force in the gulf now totals about 65,000 troops and
30 to 40 warships.
   Arab nations such as Egypt, Morrocco and Syria have sent
contingents to fight in the U.S.-led multinational force, while the
five-nation Gulf Cooperation Council has fielded its rapid
deployment force against him.
   The GCC members include the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and before the invasion, Kuwait.
   Saddam's speech on Baghdad television was read by Miqdad Morad,
a veteran radio and television announcer who was the only spokesman
authorized to announce military communiques during the eight-year
Iran-Iraq War.
   Saddam charged the Saudis were agents of foreign forces who were
backed by the ``Zionist money'' and the ``Zionist media,'' a
reference to domestic U.S. support for Israel.

   A jury was selected Wednesday in the trial
of a state lawmaker's 19-year-old son, who is charged with shooting
and killing his mother with a hunting arrow during a dispute at the
family's farmhouse.
   Chad Goetsch, the son of Rep. Robert Goetsch of Juneau, is
charged with first-degree intentional homicide in the Nov. 8
killing of his mother, Carolyn, 51. The charge carries a mandatory
sentence of life in prison.
   Although the trial will be held in Dodge County Circuit Court in
Juneau, lawyers selected jurors in Balsam Lake in Polk County _
about 300 miles northwest of Juneau. Judge Daniel Klossner ordered
the jury to be chosen there to ensure that the panelists weren't
influenced by news reports on the case.
   The jurors were impaneled and taken back to Juneau on Wednesday
afternoon. Opening arguments were set for Thursday morning. The
trial is expected to last two weeks and include a trip to the home
where the killing occurred.
   Authorities say the killing took place after Chad Goetsch had
returned home from Marquette University in Milwaukee, where he was
a freshman, at about 4 a.m. After his mother answered the door and
let him in, the two began arguing. A short time later, authorities
say, Mrs. Goetsch was shot with the arrow in the doorway of her
son's bedroom.
   Goetsch is also charged with recklessly endangering his father's
safety during a struggle that allegedly ensued seconds after Mrs.
Goetsch's death.
   Goetsch has pleaded innocent to both charges. He has told police
he was practicing with a hunting bow when the arrow accidentally
was shot and struck his mother in the heart.

<HEAD>Baptist Leader Supports President Bush on Troop Deployment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After earlier charging that sending U.S.
troops to the Persian Gulf lacked any moral principle, the leader
of the nation's largest black church body on Wednesday said he
supported President Bush's decision.
   ``As true Americans, we owe allegiance to the Stars and Stripes
forever,'' said the Rev. T.J. Jemison.
   He told about 10,000 delegates at the annual meeting of the
National Baptist Convention U.S.A. Inc. that he stood behind the
president's decision to send tens of thousands of U.S. troops to
the Middle East in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. ``We are
loyal and devoted citizens.''
   Jemison then recited the Pledge of Allegiance at the first
general business meeting of the convention.
   In welcoming ceremonies Monday, Jemison said the U.S. military
deployment was over oil. ``We are not fighting over any principal
or ideal,'' he said.
   He also said if more time was spent at the negotiating table,
the nation wouldn't have to spend $1 billion a month on the
military action. ``Think of the good that billion dollars could do
for black America and poor white America,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, Jemison changed his focus to the ``immoral''
regime of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
   In remarks after the business meeting, Jemison said he regretted
that the military struggle was over oil, but he said Bush did what
he had to do to preserve the American way of life. He also urged
Bush to pursue greater diplomatic efforts to end the struggle.

<TEXT>
   The State Department said Wednesday night it
had received a report that an American citizen was shot by an Iraqi
soldier in Kuwait while trying to avoid capture.
   ``We have no information on how serious his injuries might be,''
the department said in a statement.
   Diplomats at the blockaded U.S. Embassy in Kuwait city spoke
with officials at the hospital where they were told the American
had been taken, but ``hospital officials said they had no knowledge
of the incident,'' the statement said.
   ``The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad has been instructed to contact the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to demand consular access to this
citizen,'' said the statement read by Tom Dougherty, a spokesman.
   Dougherty said the family of the man believed to have been shot
had been told of the report but he was not at liberty to identify
him.
   ``Attempts by our embassy in Kuwait to obtain more information
from Iraqi officials in Kuwait have been in vain. We will continue
to press this case,'' Dougherty said.
   Though the statement spoke only of ``a report'' of a shooting,
Dougherty said the department believed it was a well-founded report.
   Iraqi soldiers have been rounding up westerners in Kuwait ever
since their Aug. 2 takeover of the country. Embassies have been
ordered closed and diplomats transferred to Baghdad.
   The United States and several other countries have refused to
recognize the closure order. Iraq has cut off access to the
embassies, stopped water and power service, and has told diplomats
there they have lost their diplomatic immunity.
   Diplomats have stayed in the U.S. embassy, which has not been
invaded, and have not tested their diplomatic status in the streets.

<HEAD>Palestinians Get Life Sentences as Uprising Marks 1,000th Day</HEAD>

   A military court sentenced four Palestinians to
life in prison for murdering an Arab village leader, the army said
Wednesday, the 1,000th day of the uprising against Israeli rule of
the occupied lands.
   Arab reporters said the men, all from the West Bank village of
Kfar Bidiya, killed the village leader on suspicion he sold land to
Israelis.
   Underground leaders of the uprising had called for protest
marches to mark the anniversary of the Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, but no demonstrations were reported.
   Instead, thousands of Palestinian children marched off to the
first day of elementary school classes in the West Bank. One
stone-throwing incident was reported in a schoolyard.
   The army said the four men sentenced on Tuesday were Hassan
Id-Alkum, Ahmed Salah, Salah Abu-Safia and Hasan El-Kara. They were
convicted of gunning down Mustafa Salim Abu Bakr, 41, the muhktar,
or traditional leader, of Kfar Bidiya in October 1988, the army
said.
   The gunmen set Abu Bakr's body afire after killing him. The
muhktar's two young sons were wounded in the incident.
   About 255 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs in the
33-month-old uprising, most on suspicion of collaboration with
Israeli authorities.
   In addition, 728 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
soldiers or civilians, and 47 Israelis have died in the violence.
   Repeated orders from the Palestine Liberation Organization
urging moderation in collaborator interrogations have not reduced
the collaborator killings.
   Meanwhile, the Israeli military government allowed 195,000
elementary students in the West Bank to begin their 1990-91 school
year.
   Intermediate and senior high schools will be allowed to open in
the next several weeks if there are no problems at elementary
schools, the government said. About 100,000 students attend these
schools.
   Gaza schools opened Tuesday, and no incidents were reported,
according to Israeli radio reports.
   Most elementary and secondary schools in the West Bank were
closed for at least six months during the 1988-89 school year after
the army charged they were hotbeds of anti-Israeli activity.
   Human rights groups and Palestinian educators said the closures
constituted collective punishment.
   Israeli authorities warned that schools would be closed again if
violence breaks out.
   ``We are assuming that parents, teachers and students will be
aware of the fact that we will not agree to suffer violence or
incitement from within the schools,'' said Brig. Gen. Freddie Zach,
deputy coordinator for the territories. ``We hope that they will
try to do all they can in order to keep violence out of the
schools.''

<HEAD>Monrovia Residents Flock to Areas Under Control of West Africans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Monrovia residents seeking
food and safety flocked Wednesday to areas of the capital under the
control of a West African military force.
   Monrovia has been virtually cut off from the outside world for
more than two months, partly because of heavy street fighting
between troops loyal to President Samuel Doe and two rival rebel
factions.
   Maj. Chris Otulana, a spokesman for the five-nation West African
force, said Wednesday that ``everywhere in Monrovia is calm at the
moment.''
   He said some rebels loyal to Charles Taylor were cooperating in
efforts to restore peace to the capital.
   But Taylor, who has vowed to destroy the task force, continued
broadcasts from a captured government radio transmitter. They
accused the West African soldiers of abuses ranging from murdering
civilians to selling cocaine to children.
   Both Doe and Prince Johnson, the leader of a splinter rebel
group, have welcomed the West African troops. Their forces appeared
to be observing a truce that began Aug. 24, the day the West
Africans landed.
   The West Africans were sent to Liberia under orders to end the
civil war, which has left at least 5,000 people, mostly civilians,
dead since December.
   Taylor contends that the West African intervention is just a
ploy to keep Doe in power. He has expressed concern that the force
includes soldiers from Nigeria and Guinea, whose leaders in the
past supported Doe.
   Thousands of Monrovia residents poured into areas of the capital
controlled by the 3,000 troops from those nations and Ghana, Sierra
Leone and Gambia. They apparently felt safer there than in the
areas held by Doe or Johnson.
   The influx was especially heavy at night. In the areas
controlled by the West Africans, there was more commerce than at
any time since the fighting hit the capital, with food the most
highly sought after item.
   The West Africans control the port area, but efforts to use
Spriggs Payne Airfield to bring in supplies has been hampered by
the threat of mortar fire from Taylor's troops. The airport is
controlled by Doe's forces, but Taylor's rebels have staged
occasional attacks.
   Diplomats said that if the African force can open the airport,
it will deny Taylor any hold on the city and also restore an air
link with the outside world.
   Once in firm control of the capital, the West Africans could
then move to restore electricity and water, and bring in
desperately needed food and medicine.
   When the task force arrived, Monrovia had been isolated and
without water and electricity for two months. There was almost no
food.
   The task force was not expected to make any major push against
Taylor's forces until its commander, Lt. Gen. Arnold Quainoo of
Ghana, returns from consultations with West African leaders later
this week.
   Taylor's rebels invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24, branding
Doe's government as corrupt and saying they would overthrow it. A
rebel faction led by Johnson broke with Taylor in February.
   Taylor since has declared himself president of Liberia. His
forces hold most of the country outside Monrovia, but their advance
in the capital's eastern suburbs was held up by Doe's troops. Doe
remains holed up in his fortified seaside mansion, and Johnson's
rebel group controls part of the capital.

   NASA scrubbed the launch of space
shuttle Columbia for the third time after discovering a leak as
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were being poured into the fuel
tank on Wednesday.
   The decision was made after 10 times the normal amount of
hydrogen was found in the shuttle's aft compartment, said shuttle
director Robert Crippen.
   The launch crew immediately began trying to trace the leak. No
new launch date was set.
   NASA canceled the first launch attempt in May after sensors
detected an unusual buildup of liquid hydrogen during fueling in
the aft compartment and around a valve in plumbing between the
orbiter and external tank. The second scrub was last week because
mission control had trouble communicating with one of the four
telescopes in Columbia's cargo bay.
   ``I think we got fooled by the fact we had two leaks,'' Crippen
said. ``I think this leak has been there all along.''
   Crippen said there was no leak this time in the connecting link
between shuttle and tank. The aft compartment, where the explosive
hydrogen was found, contains the shuttle's main engines.
   Thursday's attempt would have been the 36th shuttle flight and
the first in four months.
   Wednesday's troubles were the latest blow to NASA's image. The
highly touted Hubble Space Telescope failed to operate as
advertised because its mirrors were ground wrong; the shuttle
Atlantis developed a hydrogen leak similar to Columbia's and NASA
controllers had intermittent problems contacting the Magellan space
probe which is orbiting Venus.
   ``The shuttle's business is flying, and we're sitting on the
ground,'' Crippen said. ``I guess all I can say is that the shuttle
is a very complicated vehicle. It flies in environments that are
very strenuous and we have to be able to assure that the vehicle is
safe to fly.''
   In the three months since the first leak was discovered, NASA
has tested and retested the lines between the fuel tank and its
three shuttles, but never with a tankload of fuel.
   Crippen said he didn't regret his decision against a tanking
test. Such a test would have required five or six days.
   ``It wouldn't have given me that much lead time,'' Crippen said.
   The line being used on Columbia is new, having been taken from
the orbiter Endeavour, which is under construction in California.
   The leak Wednesday wasn't in the area of that line, NASA said.
But the space agency offered no clue where else it might be.
   Space shuttles rely on two sources of power to get into orbit.
Two solid fuel rockets burn for two minutes to get the vehicle off
the ground. At the same time _ and continuing for eight minutes _
the orbiter engines burn a combination of liquid oxygen and liquid
hydrogen.
   The shuttle's 154-foot-long tank holds 385,000 gallons of liquid
hydrogen which is cooled to 423 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, and
144,000 gallons of liquid oxygen at 297 degrees below zero.
   The leak was revealed as the hydrogen was pumped in at the rate
of 8,400 gallons a minute _ in the so-called ``fast-fill'' mode. It
didn't show in the early minutes of fueling when the hydrogen was
loaded at the rate of 1,000 gallons a minute.
   Columbia was to have carried an array of four telescopes into
orbit. Four astronomers in the crew of seven would have operated
the instruments, which would remain in the shuttle's cargo bay. The
launch, with the $150 million Astro observatory aboard, had been
scheduled for 1:20 a.m. EDT.
   ``Dozens of us are dying to see this thing get launched,'' said
Arthur Davidsen, principal investigator of one of Astro's four
telescopes.
   It was only the fifth time NASA scheduled a shuttle launch at
night and the first shuttle mission in five years devoted entirely
to scientific research. The night launch was planned because of the
demands of the astronomy mission. Speaking to NASA employees via
closed-circuit television from the Johnson Space Center in Houston,
Vice President Dan Quayle called the mission ``cutting-edge space
activity.''
   He said that despite its recent problems, NASA is up to doing
the job it was assigned to do.
   ``Take it from a guy who knows a lot about unwarranted
criticism,'' he said. ``Once they pile it on, they just don't know
when to stop.''
   Standing about 1{ miles away was Discovery, which was moved to
NASA's other shuttle launch pad Tuesday night to await an October
flight with the Ulysses satellite that will study the sun.
   The Astro, designed to study highly energetic stars, galaxies
and other hot objects, has been waiting for a shuttle ride since
March 1986, NASA's original target date for the mission. The flight
was postponed indefinitely because of the Challenger disaster
earlier that year.

   An Iraqi soldier shot an American citizen
trying to avoid capture in Kuwait, according to a reported reaching
the State Department revealed by the department Wednesday night.
   The reported shooting happened during a day in which President
Bush telephoned the besieged U.S. Embassy in Kuwait to encourage
the ambassador and his skeleton staff to hang on under ``most
difficult circumstances.''
   Separately, Bush told lawmakers he would consider further moves
if economic pressure fails to push Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
   The State Department said attempts by U.S. diplomats ``to obtain
more information from Iraqi officials in Kuwait have been in vain.
We will continue to press this case.''
   The department declined to identify the American and said it did
not know the seriousness of his injuries.
   Bush, who met privately with more than 30 senators and House
members, will address a public joint session of Congress next
Tuesday night after returning from his weekend summit meeting with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said.
   Senior administration aides, meanwhile, disclosed that the
United States wants its allies to pay the entire cost, either in
cash or contributions of material, of the U.S. military buildup in
the Persian Gulf. The aides said the administration estimated those
costs as $6 billion to the end of the year and $1 billion a month
after that, plus $10.5 billion a year for nearby states hurt by the
trade embargo and an unspecified sum for developing countries
battered by oil price increases.
   At the Capitol on Wednesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III wound up a second day of congressional questioning _ repeating
his proposal for planning of a new ``regional security structure''
for the Middle East _ and was leaving Wednesday night for Saudi
Arabia.
   He said anew that Americans should not expect any quick
resolution of the standoff which has brought tens of thousands of
U.S. troops to the Saudi desert, across the Kuwaiti border from an
even larger force of Iraqis.
   Current U.S. efforts, aimed at weakening Saddam's resolve
through the economic embargo, ``are going to take some time, and
that is what we ask most of the American people: Stand firm, be
patient and remain united so that together we can show that
aggression does not pay,'' Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
   However the current situation plays out, he said, ``this is not
the last crisis of this nature we are likely to face in this
region. ... It is worthwhile to begin considering regional security
structures ... that would guarantee an equilibrium in this region
that will produce peace'' and ``create a more durable order.'' He
gave no details and said such planning was in a very early stage.
   Meanwhile, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to the
United States, sent letters to each member of Congress expressing
his country's gratitude for lawmakers' support of Operation Desert
Shield.
   ``I want to convey our regard and respect for the individual men
and women of the American air, naval and ground units now
temporarily in Saudi Arabia and the adjoining waters, side by side
with our own defense forces and those from a number of important
Arab, European and other countries vigilantly there,'' he said.
   In one military development, the Navy said it had authorized the
battleship USS Wisconsin in the Persian Gulf to fire its 16-inch
guns, which had been silenced in May after an investigation was
reopened into the deadly explosion aboard the Wisconsin's sister
ship, the USS Iowa.
   Navy spokesman Cmdr. Jim Mitchell said additional tests had
``determined that the 16-inch guns may safely fire specified lots
of powder, which are now loaded on the Wisconsin.''
   Baker's overseas trip, which will also include the weekend
U.S.-Soviet summit in Helsinki and later stops in Europe, will be
partly focused on soliciting major contributions to help pay for
the Mideast effort opposing Saddam. Another Cabinet member,
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, was on his way to South Korea
Wednesday after winning a pledge of support from Margaret Thatcher
in London.
   At the White House, Fitzwater said Bush called the embassy in
Kuwait City to express his appreciation to Ambassador Nathaniel
Howell and the few other staff members who stayed behind to assist
Americans trapped in the region.
   Iraq has cut off water and electricity to the embassy as part of
its effort to shut down all foreign embassies in the land they
annexed following an Aug. 2 lightning invasion.
   Bush told his envoy ``to keep up the good work under these most
difficult circumstances,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``Ambassador Howell is struggling with a very difficult
situation in terms of the physical conditions there. They have
fast-diminishing supplies of water and electricity. But as you all
know and have seen on the television reports, the embassy staff
there has been actively working with U.S. citizens in helping to
facilitate these flights out of Kuwait and out of Iraq,'' the
spokesman said.
   Later on Wednesday, Bush met with more 30 members of Congress
concerning the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Bush told them that ``we must keep pressure on Iraq and convince
Saddam Hussein that time is against him,'' Fitzwater said. ``The
president said, `The sanctions must succeed. If not, we will review
our options.'''
   The spokesman would not elaborate.
   The lawmakers gave Bush ``repeated statements of support to see
this mission through,'' Fitzwater said.
   They also had suggestions, they indicated in comments after the
meeting. In some of them:
   _Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said the U.S. troops stationed in the
Saudi Arabian desert might be given pay and income tax incentives
``to forestall a morale problem.'' Glenn, part of a congressional
delegation just back from the Middle East, said he also suggested
such benefits as free stamps.
   _Glenn suggested sanctions against countries letting planes
depart for Iraq.
   _Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said Bush should push Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev during this weekend's summit meeting
to pull remaining Soviet military and technical advisers out of
Iraq.
   _Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said he urged Bush to press the
Soviets for intelligence on the Iraqi military capability.
   Fitzwater praised the Soviet Union's role in the international
effort to isolate Iraq.
   During the day, the White House brushed off Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's incorrectly reported statement that ``the children
of Iraq are dying'' because of the U.N.-supported economic embargo,
dismising it as a ``rhetorical diatribe.'' The statement later was
determined to be an incorrect translation from the Arabic.

   Leftist guerrillas bombed the country's
main oil pipeline Wednesday, forcing the state-run oil company
Ecopetrol to suspend pumping.
   Ecopetrol said it has stopped pumping 235,000 barrels of crude
oil a day _ almost half its daily output.
   Guerrillas of the National Liberation Army, known as the ELN,
blew up a section of the Cano Limon oil pipeline in northeastern
Colombia, Ecopetrol said. The explosion caused an oil spill, but
the company did not give any details.
   The 500-mile-long pipeline transports most of the country's
petroleum destined for export.
   The pro-Cuban National Liberation Army has bombed the pipeline
scores of times since 1986, causing losses estimated at $520
million.
   The guerrilla group is seeking to reduce the presence of foreign
oil companies in Colombia. It is the only leftist rebel group that
has refused to join peace talks with the government.
   Colombia is currently producing at maximum capacity _ around
465,000 barrels a day. Around 200,000 barrels a day are earmarked
for the international market where prices have risen sharply
because of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Last month, President Cesar Gaviria announced that Colombia was
raising its oil production by about 15,000 barrels per day to join
other oil producers in helping make up for the shortfall resulting
from the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   U.N. economic sanctions have caused the withdrawal of more than
4 million barrels a day of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil from the world
market. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela have
boosted production to cover most of the shortfall.

<TEXT>
   George Plimpton, Joyce Carol Oates and
Susan Sontag are among the literary chorus pleading with the
president of Yale University to save the prestigious Yale Review.
   The literary quarterly, which introduced the works of Eudora
Welty, Robert Frost, Robert Penn Warren, Virginia Woolf, Eugene
O'Neill, among others, is to be shelved after issuing its 79th
volume in November.
   More than 50 novelists, critics, professors and poets have
signed a petition opposing the decision to halt publication of the
magazine, the oldest literary quarterly in the country.
   The petition was delivered Tuesday to Yale President Benno C.
Schmidt Jr..
   Schmidt announced in June that Yale would shelve the quarterly
after its 79th volume, citing financial difficulty, limited
readership and the absence of any direct tie to Yale's academic
programs.
   Annie Dillard, author of ``Pilgrim at Tinker Creek''; Plimpton,
editor of The Paris Review; Charles McGrath, deputy editor of The
New Yorker magazine; Robert Giroux, editor of Farrar, Straus and
Giroux publishers in New York; and James Laughlin, the founding
editor of New Directions, a literary magazine, were among those to
sign the petition.
   Other signatories from the literary world included novelist Iris
Murdoch, author Oates, poet Adrienne Rich, critic Sontag, Pulitzer
Prize-winning poets William Meredith and Richard Wilbur, and Lord
Noel Annan, former provost of Kings College at Cambridge University
and the University of London.
   Schmidt said a list of names would not, taken alone, make a
difference in his decision, though ``they are serious people and
ought to be paid attention to.''
   The Yale Review has a paid circulation of only about 4,200.
   Schmidt said he wasn't confident he could raise the $1 million
or so needed for an endowment to fund the the magazine's annual
cost of $60,000 to $80,000 at a time the university faces other
financial pressures.
   Several potential donors have expressed interest in helping fund
various sorts of publications, he said, some ``along the lines of
The Yale Review and some not.'' However, he said ``there is no
clear sense as yet whether they will ripen into actual
commitments.''
   Penelope Laurans, the magazine's acting editor, said Wednesday
she was encouraged by the show of support. But she added, ``it
would be wrong of me to say I felt that this particular attention
meant the review was necessarily going to be saved.''

   A Connecticut company is recalling its
``Streamer Spray,'' an aerosol product that could catch fire if
sprayed near an open flame, the Consumer Product Safety Commission
said Wednesday.
   Streamer Spray, manufactured by Cotracto Inc. of Hartford, is
used at parties and other festive occasion to throw a stringy
substance like confetti.
   Since the spray is intended for use by children, it is banned
under the Hazardous Substances Act, the commission said.
   Tests prompted by consumer complaints confirmed the propellant
in the can is flammable, the commission said.
   Streamer Spray comes in aerosol cans with orange, pink, yellow
and green plastic caps corresponding to the color of the string.
Cans are labelled in part, ``Streamer Spray.''
   About 5,500 cans were sold between November 1989 and January
1990.
   The commission said consumers should not use any cans on hand
and should return them to the stores where purchased for a refund.

<TEXT>
   A toxic plume from a fire that gutted a
chemical-filled warehouse near the Prudhoe Bay oil field prompted
the evacuation of more than 1,000 workers, state officials said.
   But there were no reports Wednesday of injuries, nor that
chemicals had spilled onto the tundra, the delicate arctic layer of
plants that can take years to regenerate.
   The fire at the Dowell Schlumberger Inc. warehouse at an
oil-field service camp in Deadhorse was contained within four hours
Tuesday night, said Louis Steinke, Alaska manager for Dowell
Schlumberger.
   Brad Fristoe, North Slope district manager for the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation, said the nature of the
fire made it difficult to fight and the building essentially was
left to burn.
   Fristoe said the DEC would investigate whether chemicals spilled
on the tundra. Steinke said there was no evidence of a spill.
   Fristoe said at least 1,000 oil-field workers were evacuated,
but Steinke said there were wide fluctuations in estimates and he
did not have a figure. Workers returned Wednesday morning.
   ``The plume was caused by a number of the chemicals they had
within the building,'' Fristoe said. The warehouse contents
included lubricants, acid and solvent, he said. Steinke said a list
of the building's inventory was being drawn up.
   The fire did not interrupt the flow of oil from Prudhoe Bay,
which supplies 20 percent of the nation's crude. Dowell
Schlumberger's work includes keeping oil wells in working order.

   Tomatoes grown from seeds that spent years in
space don't seem much different from their home-grown cousins, NASA
researchers say.
   ``I've noticed that the space seeds germinate earlier,'' James
Poindexter, an education specialist at Johnson Space Center, said
Tuesday. ``After that, there's no difference in the growth rate.
They all flowered at the same time. I didn't see any noticeable
differences.''
   Some 12.5 million seeds were retrieved from the bus-size Long
Duration Exposure Facility by the crew of the shuttle Columbia in
January. Some of the seeds that were planted at the Houston space
center have yielded juicy red tomatoes.
   Millions of the seeds were sent to schools nationwide, and
student growers later this month will submit growth data to
Oklahoma State University's aerospace education services program.
The OSU program will analyze and summarize the results.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday urged Arabs to rise

   An American citizen, meanwhile, was reported shot in
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait but details were sketchy.
   The State Department said Wednesday night in Washington that it
received a report an Iraqi soldier fired on an American who was
trying to avoid capture, adding, ``We have no information on how
serious his injuries might be.''
   Iraqi troops have been rounding up Westerners in Kuwait since
Iraq invaded and seized the small oil state on Aug. 2. Embassies in
Kuwait have been ordered closed and diplomats transferred to
Baghdad.
   Western women and children detained in Kuwait and Iraq trickled
out in small groups Wednesday, leaving behind hundreds who lack
permission to depart. Iraq, criticized for blocking releases with
red tape, said it was doing everything it could to expedite
departures.
   On Thursday, an Air France jet flew into Paris from Jordan
carrying 153 Westerners allowed to leave Iraq, including three
pregnant women. Those aboard included 105 French women and
children, 28 Britons and at least nine Americans. The American
women had Arabic names, indicating they had married Arabs.
   Japan and the Soviet Union asked Iraq on Wednesday to withdraw
at once from Kuwait and free all foreigners held in Iraq and
Kuwait. A joint statement issued in Tokyo by Foreign Minister Taro
Nakayama and visiting Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
was the first ever by the two nations on an international issue,
Foreign Ministry officials there said.
   As a multinational armada grew in the Persian Gulf, U.S. Army
officials in Saudi Arabia said the military was using night convoys
to move heavy firepower _ including ground-to-air missiles and
rocket launchers _ into the northern Saudi desert.
   Although Washington says its troops are deployed to defend the
Saudis, the recent moves increase the offensive capabilities of
U.S. forces.
   President Bush indicated Wednesday the United States has not
ruled out an offensive role, telling lawmakers back from the gulf
that if sanctions do not succeed, ``we will review our options.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was headed for the Middle
East, where he said he planned to discuss with U.S. allies a
proposed new regional security structure for the Persian Gulf.
   In the Gulf of Oman, U.S. forces released an Iraqi-flagged
freighter they intercepted and boarded Tuesday as it headed for
Iraq with a cargo of tea.
   The Navy said the ship was allowed to proceed to an unspecified
port after a 30-hour search. Shipping sources said it headed for
Yemen.
   Saddam has promised to free all foreign women and children but
to keep the men as human shields against attack at strategic sites.
In another attempt to play on Western anxiety about the captives,
he released messages Tuesday purported to be from seven such
hostages, including an American.
   Also, London-based Kurdish dissidents from Iraq pinpointed six
installations where they said hostages were held. They included a
chemical weapons factory, an air force training college and other
military bases.
   In other developments:
   _ Iraq called up its reserve officers Wednesday, the Iraqi News
Agency reported. A statement issued by the Defense Ministry said
reserve officers in all specialties except chemical warfare would
be subject to the call-up. The statement was broadcast on Iraqi
radio, according to the INA dispatch monitored in Cyprus.
   _ Britain pledged funds to a U.S.-led effort to help nations
suffering from the U.N.-ordered sanctions against Iraq. Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher made the commitment at a meeting with
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   _ Diplomatic efforts continued, with King Hussein of Jordan
conferring in Baghdad with Saddam and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz meeting in Moscow with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Soviet President Gorbachev meets Bush on Sunday in Helsinki,
Finland, to discuss the crisis. Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who met
Gorbachev on Wednesday, said later he thought Aziz may pass a
message to Gorbachev to relay to Bush at the summit.
   _ Britons paid nearly $40 million in purchase taxes on gasoline
in August because of higher pump prices triggered by the crisis,
Britain's Automobile Association said Wednesday.
   _ Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the exiled emir of Kuwait,
reassured Kuwaitis on Saudi television Wednesday of worldwide
support for an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait and restoration of his
family's rule.
   _ Bush placed a morale-boosting call to U.S. Ambassador
Nathaniel Howell at the besieged U.S. Embassy in Kuwait City, where
a skeleton staff remains.
   Saddam, in his televised statement Wednesday, said the U.N.
embargo imposed on Iraq on Aug. 6 may be imperiling the lives of
Iraqi children.
   He also called upon ``all Arabs, within the teachings of Allah
and according to the Moslem Holy War of Jihad, to fight this U.S.
presence of non-believers and to fight the stance taken by Arab
agents who have followed these foreigners.''
   He was referring to Saudi Arabia, which allowed U.S. troops onto
its soil, and countries such as Egypt and Morocco, which sent
contingents to fight in the multinational force.
   Addressing the people of those countries, he said: ``We call on
them to revolt against the traitors . . . and fight the presence in
the Holy Land (of the Western force.)
   He said in his speech, ``Have you, O brothers, known throughout
the history that you have come across that anyone tried to starve a
nation to death by depriving it of food?
   ``And have you witnessed in the history that is known to you
that some children should die because of a premeditated decision to
deprive them of milk?
   ``The children of Iraq, before the rest of the nation, refuse
that we beg for the milk which they need from the infidels and
shameless.''
   An earlier translation from Saddam's Arabic speech, which was
carried by The Associated Press, incorrectly quoted Saddam as
saying some children were dying as a result of the sanctions.
   Saddam reiterated that his people would defy the boycott and
emerge victorious.
   A group of Americans who reached Jordan on Tuesday were treated
to a free ride home by British tycoon Richard Branson, who flew
them to London and then Newark, N.J., on his Virgin Atlantic
Airways. Of the 29 Americans, 24 flew on to Newark and five stopped
over in London.
   The plane that took them to London carried 40 tons of supplies
for tens of thousands of desperate Asian evacuees from Kuwait and
Iraq, now stranded in the desert just inside Jordan as they await
transport home.
   AmeriCares, a non-profit world relief organization, said
Wednesday its first emergency airlift to Jordan for suffering
refugees will take off from Bradley International Airport at
Windsor Locks, Conn., on Saturday with 42{ tons of relief supplies.
   In Baghdad, 306 British women and children who arrived in a
seven-bus convoy from Kuwait after a long trip across the desert
were awaiting exit visas, diplomats said.
   About 11,000 Westerners are still believed stranded in Kuwait
and Iraq.
   INA said the hostages who allegedly sent the messages it printed
were ``at a vital installation.'' It did not say where.
   The agency, which for weeks has issued a stream of anti-American
progaganda, gave no indication of how statements from the seven men
had been obtained.

   A woman who has camped for two and a half
years at the death site of Martin Luther King Jr. returned to her
vigil Wednesday after a judge refused to convict her of blocking a
sidewalk.
   Jacqueline Smith, 39, has lived outside The Lorraine Motel for
most of the time since March 1988. A former employee and resident
of The Lorraine, Ms. Smith opposes turning the motel into a $9
million museum, saying it will be ``a tourist trap.''
   City police cited Ms. Smith in July for blocking a sidewalk.
Authorities said a conviction on that charge would clear the way
for a court order instructing her to move.
   City prosecutor Don Dino called one witness, a police officer,
at a brief hearing before city Judge Steve Carter. The officer said
Ms. Smith had various possessions blocking a city sidewalk, an
offense carrying a $50 fine.
   Ms. Smith told the judge she was unable to read her copy of the
police citation because it was illegible.
   ``I didn't know what I was being charged with,'' she said.
   After looking over the citation, the judge said the city failed
to prove its case. He declined further comment.
   King was assassinated at The Lorraine in 1968 while helping
organize a sanitation strike. The motel wing where King was felled
by a rifle slug will serve as the centerpiece of the museum. The
state now holds title to the property.

<HEAD>While Dukakis is Away, Lt. Gov. Wants to Try Fiscal Cure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy said Wednesday she's
waiting for Gov. Michael Dukakis to leave on a trade mission to
Europe so that as acting governor she can push her own plan for
curing the state's fiscal troubles.
   Dukakis, who has postponed the trip, angrily replied that Murphy
was playing politics in her lagging bid to win the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination.
   Earlier, Murphy said: ``I'll put my proposals on the table if he
continues on his trip.''
   ``When I'm in charge, I'll show you how I make some decisions,''
she said.
   ``The governor's in charge,'' Murphy added. ``When he wants my
opinion, he can ask for it.''
   She did not make any details of her fiscal plan public.
   ``This is Alexandra Haig with Nixon's secret plan,'' said
Dukakis spokesman Stephen Crawford. He referred to then-Secretary
of State Alexander Haig, who said he was in charge of the White
House when President Reagan was wounded in an assassination
attempt, and Richard Nixon, who said during the 1968 presidential
election that he had a plan to end the Vietnam War but never made
it public.
   A Dukakis administration source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Murphy refused to provide the governor with details
of her proposal when he asked her during a telephone conversation
Wednesday afternoon.
   Dukakis said of that conversation: ``What I heard was a
candidate who was trying to use this state's fiscal situation for
personal political gain.''
   Murphy made her comments while looking to inject life into her
campaign for governor. Murphy has been trailing her two Democratic
opponents, Francis X. Bellotti and John Silber, who have tried to
link her with the state's fiscal collapse under the Dukakis
administration.
   Lieutenant governors are elected independently in Massachusetts,
so Murphy isn't part of the Dukakis administration, though both are
Democrats.
   She has said in the past that she disagreed with the state's
spending practices. But her statements Wednesday marked one of her
sharpest departures from Dukakis, who has low popularity and is not
seeking re-election.
   Massachusetts had one of the strongest economies of any state in
the late 1980s, and Dukakis touted the ``Massachusetts miracle''
while he campaigned for president in 1988. But when he returned to
the state after losing to George Bush, the economy began a slide
that still is worsening.
   Dukakis had been scheduled to leave on a European trade mission
earlier this week. But he postponed his travel plans after learning
that state tax collections fell below projections for the second
straight month. Aides said Wednesday he hadn't decided when to
leave.
   On Tuesday, Dukakis ordered cabinet secretaries to devise plans
to cut $150 million from the $13.4 billion budget for fiscal 1991.
The Legislature earlier this year ordered $265 million in cuts and
approved the biggest tax increase in state history.
   Murphy said Dukakis wasn't acting fast enough.
   ``He hasn't cut yet,'' she said. ``He asked for plans. There has
to be a sense of urgency.''
   Robert Donahue, campaign director for Silber, said Murphy ``had
the opportunity when the state was in a mess, when the governor was
campaigning (for president in 1988). She ignored it then.''

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea on Thursday proposed that
the two Koreas officially recognize each other's governments, but
the communist North was not likely to accept.
   South Korean Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon initially made the
offer Wednesday at the first talks ever between prime ministers of
the hostile nations, but the proposal was not acted upon.
   Their final closed-door session started Thursday morning with
the seven official delegates of both sides sitting across from one
another at a conference table in a hotel ballroom.
   North Korea has steadfastly refused to recognize the legitimacy
of the Seoul government, maintaining that such a policy would
perpetuate the division of the peninsula, split in 1945.
   South Korea believes mutual recognition would be practical and
allow both nations to coexit until unification of the peninsula
could be achieved.
   Moreover, the South says the North has given tacit recognition
by agreeing to hold the historic talks, the highest-level contact
ever held between the nations.
   South Korean spokesman Kim Hyung-ki told a briefing that mutual
recognition is ``necessary to ease mutual distrust and improve
relations'' between the counties.
   He also said 10 North Koreans, including Prime Minister Yon
Hyong Muk, would visit South Korean President Roh Tae-woo later
Thursday at the presidential mansion.
   That meeting would mark the first time the leader of South Korea
has received an official representative of the rival communist
North Korean government since separate governments were formed in
1948.
   During Wednesday's meeting, about 1,000 radical students marched
through Seoul, shouting anti-U.S., anti-government slogans and
hurling rocks and firebombs at riot police.
   ``No prime ministers' talks without release of unification
prisoners!'' shouted the students at Seoul National University.
``U.S. troops, get out!'' Riot police fired tear gas to block the
students from marching off campus. Several students and police were
injured and at least five students were arrested.
   In addition, eight radicals were arrested for staging illegal
demonstrations in front of the hotel where the prime ministers were
meeting. A North Korean television cameraman trying to film the
scene was roughed up by riot police trying to stop him. He was not
injured.
   The radical students, a small but vocal minority in South Korea,
oppose the presence of the 43,000 U.S. troops in their country,
saying it hinders chances for unification of North and South Korea.
The Americans are here under a mutual defense pact with South Korea.
   During Wednesday's meeting, North Korea demanded that South
Korea release jailed dissidents and stop joint military exercises
with the United States. The North also demanded that South Korea
stop efforts to enter the United Nations separately, saying that to
do so would perpetuate national division.
   The North Korean leader accused South Korea of trying to seek a
``two-Korea'' policy through the talks.
   ``If your side takes a two-Korea road, our dialogue would be
meaningless and lose its significance,'' the North's premier said.
``You must stop efforts to maintain status quo.''
   South Korean officials indicated they would reject all three
demands at Thursday's closed-door session.
   The prime ministers met Tuesday and opened formal talks
Wednesday. The North Koreans are to return home Friday. If all goes
well, they will meet again next month in the North Korean capital.
   Virtually all the demands and proposals issued by both sides
Wednesday have been made before, but never face to face by
representatives of the rival governments.

   She is a senior at Mars Hill College studying music performance.
   In an earlier contest, Miss Dalton won the second of three
swimsuit competitions.
   The 23-year-old Orlando resident is a senior at Rollins College,
majoring in therapeutic recreation and music. She jogs, swims,
bicycles and trains with weights to stay in shape.
   The 50 contestants are divided into three groups, to compete in
talent, swimsuit and evening gown divisions on three successive
nights to qualify for Saturday's finals.
   Wednesday was the second of three preliminary competitions in
swimsuit, talent and evening gown categories. The winner of the
evening gown competition is kept secret to heighten the suspense
for Saturday night's finals.
   On Saturday, the top 10 finishers will be announced and compete
on nationally televised finals.
   In picking the 10 semifinalists, talent counts for 40 percent;
interviews conducted during the week, 30 percent; and swimsuit and
evening gown each 15 percent.

<HEAD>Illinois Execution Method Challenged as Cruel and Unusual</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Wednesday rejected an attempt
to block an execution by a drug-dispensing machine that prisoner's
lawyers contend could inflict cruel and unusual punishment.
   U.S. District Judge James Zagel denied an injunction to block
the Sept. 12 execution of Charles Walker, who could become the
first person executed in Illinois in 28 years.
   Zagel said the convicted murderer shouldn't become a ``pawn'' in
a fight over the state's death penalty statute.
   Lawyers working on behalf of condemned prisoners had filed a
lawsuit in federal court seeking class-action status for the nearly
130 Illinois inmates on Death Row.
   The lawsuit contended the state would violate its own death
penalty law by executing the inmates with a machine that delivers a
lethal combination of three drugs. State law specifically states
that two drugs are to be used.
   The judge continued the hearing on the lethal-injection issue
for eight weeks, which would be after Walker's execution date.
   The lawsuit recalls the controversy in Florida over whether its
electric chair was a valid means of execution or a torture device.
   During a May 4 execution of Jesse Joseph Tafero, flames and
sparks shot from the inmate's head and smoke filled Florida's
execution chamber. Tafero was finally declared dead after three
jolts of electricity.
   Attorneys for three condemned inmates won indefinite stays from
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta with arguments
the electric chair was not functioning properly. Their status was
unclear after a successful execution in the same electric chair in
July.
   The lawyers in Illinois requested an immediate injunction
blocking all state executions until their dispute was settled.
   There hasn't been an execution in Illinois since 1962.
   Stuart Altschuler, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the lawsuit
was filed because the state's lethal injection machine, execution
procedures and personnel are suspect under state law.
   The law, amended in 1983 to provide for execution by lethal
injection rather than electrocution, specifies that two chemicals
be used _ an ultra-short acting barbiturate to sedated the
condemned person and a drug that causes paralysis.
   But the machine injects three chemicals into the body: sodium
pentathol, a barbiturate to render prisoner unconscious;
pancuronium bromide, which paralyzes the prisoner, and potassium
chloride, which stops the prisoner's heart.
   It is the potassium chloride that lawyers find objectionable.
They say it is an electrolyte that could cause an excruciating
burning sensation in the prisoner's vein, and since he would be
paralyzed by the second drug, he would be unable tell anyone.
   An inmate put to death on the machine could vomit and suffocate,
which constitutes ``cruel and unusual punishment in violation of
plaintiffs' rights under the Eighth Amendment,'' the lawsuit
contends.
   ``We have not asked the judge in any way to invalidate the death
penalty,'' he said. ``We've merely asked that the state adhere to
its own laws.''
   Altschuler said he planned to file an immediate appeal.
   Terry Madsen, chief of the Illinois attorney general's criminal
appeals division, said the state continues to test its lethal
injection machine. Many other states have used it properly, he
added.
   Madsen said he was confident the machine would not inflict any
pain upon Walker or others.
   But Fred Leuchter Jr., the Boston man who invented the $25,000
machine that Illinois will use, said last month he tested the
machine in May and found it failed 70 percent of the time.
   Leuchter said the machine is ``very likely to fail'' during
Walker's execution because the machinery had been sitting in a damp
place since it was bought in 1987.
   State prison officials, however, said Leuchter made the comments
out of spite after they dropped him as a consultant to the
execution.
   Zagel also denied the lawsuit class-action status, saying such a
method should be used only in cases where the plaintiffs aren't
readily identifiable.
   He scheduled a hearing for Oct. 31 to examine how the state's
lethal injection machine functions and for a briefing on the
remaining plaintiffs, convicted killers Charles Silagy and Walter
Stewart. Both are on Death Row.
   Zagel said he felt no need to act quickly since no execution
date has been set for either man and since he ordered Walker
excluded from the lawsuit.
   In denying the petition to block Walker's execution, the judge
noted that Walker has repeatedly indicated he wants to die to pay
his debt to society for the 1983 slayings of a man and a woman in
southern Illinois.

   A man admitted to police he pulled a
plastic bag over his wife's head as she lost consciousness while
trying to commit suicide in a motel room, a recording played in
court Wednesday disclosed.
   The audio recording was played during a preliminary hearing that
will decide whether sufficient evidence exists to try Bertram
Harper on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the
Aug. 19 death of Virginia Harper.
   In the recorded statement given to a Romulus police detective
about nine hours after Mrs. Harper died, Harper described his
wife's cancer and their earlier commitment to end each other's
suffering if necessary.
   The Loomis, Calif., couple chose to do that in Michigan, Harper
said, because they understood the state has no law against helping
someone commit suicide.
   But Harper's lawyer said later the couple was not influenced by
the case of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who helped an Oregon woman commit
suicide June 4. That case has garnered publicity worldwide.
   A deputy Wayne County coroner, Sawait Kanluen, testified that
Mrs. Harper, 69, had liver cancer but neither that nor drugs she
had taken in the suicide attempt killed her. She had taken
non-toxic amounts of the pain-killer Darvon, the sleeping pill
Dalmane, and the motion-sickness drug Dramamine.
   Kanluen said Harper died of asphyxiation.
   Harper admitted to police that as his wife slipped into
unconsciousness, he placed a clear plastic bag over her head and
secured it with rubber bands knotted together.
   ``If I hadn't placed the bag, I don't know what would have
happened,'' Harper told Detective Sgt. Gordon Malaniak.
``Eventually she probably would _ perhaps come out ... of the
sleeping pills, but then she'd have been back to square one _ she'd
have been back in pain.
   ``I was doing what, to the best of my knowledge and belief, is
exactly what my wife wanted ... and intended me and counted me on
doing.''
   District Judge Henry Zaborowski adjourned the hearing until
Friday morning.
   After Wednesday's hearing, Harper held a news conference with
his stepdaughter, Shanda McGrew; defense attorney Hugh Davis; and
Derek Humphry, executive director of the Hemlock Society, an
organization advocating the right of terminally ill people to end
their lives when and as they choose. The society is financing
Harper's defense.
   Davis said the murder charge will not stand up because it lacks
the key element of malice.
   ``The definition (of malice) can't be construed broadly enough
to include love,'' he said.
   Davis also denied that the Harpers came to Michigan to carry out
their death pact because no charges have been brought against
Kevorkian, who invented a machine that Alzheimer's disease sufferer
Janet Adkins of Portland, Ore., used to kill herself. Prosecutors
are still investigating that case.
   Harper said he and his wife learned from a book by Humphry that
Michigan has no law against helping someone commit suicide.
   ``I think they've been made sacrificial lambs on the altar of
the dilemma about what to do about Dr. Kevorkian,'' Humphry said.
   Harper was jailed for a week before a bail bondsman he never met
posted his $25,000 bond. No charges have been filed against Ms.
McGrew.

<HEAD>From Miracle to Morass: Dukakis Orders More Budget Cuts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts economy, faltering since Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis ran for president in 1988, is sinking ever
deeper.
   The Legislature this year already approved the biggest tax
increase in Massachusetts history and ordered $265 million in
budget cuts.
   On Tuesday, Dukakis ordered $150 million more trimmed from state
spending _ and warned it may not be the last time he has to make
such a request.
   Dukakis also put off his participation in a trade mission to
Europe to deal with the latest bad news on the fiscal front:
lagging tax collections.
   Nearly half of Massachusetts' residents, meanwhile, would
consider moving out of the state if the economy got any worse, a
poll indicated.
   Propelled by a high-tech boom, Massachusetts' economy was among
the fastest-growing in the nation by the late 1980s. In his White
House bid, Dukakis touted the ``Massachusetts miracle'' and its
nine straight balanced budgets.
   But when he returned to the state after losing to George Bush,
the picture had begun changing. That year, lawmakers approved small
tax and fee increases to balance the budget.
   Last year, legislators approved a 15 percent income tax increase
that was supposed to be temporary.
   And this year, the Legislature approved $1.2 billion in higher
taxes this year and $1.6 billion the next fiscal year and cut
spending by 4 percent across the board.
   And still the $13.4 billion budget was in the red.
   This week, the Revenue Department reported that getting it back
into the black would be even more difficult: August tax collections
had come in $26.7 million below estimates, and collections for July
were almost as poor.
   Dukakis then ordered his Cabinet secretaries to make cuts
amounting to about 4 percent of executive branch spending.
   ``I hope this will be the last time I have to ask my cabinet
secretaries to make these reductions, but given the uncertainty, it
may not be,'' he said.
   The governor said the cuts are ``absolutely essential if we're
going to make sure that this state begins to get back on the road
to economic recovery.''
   Asked about the possibility of another tax increase, Dukakis
said, ``I don't think that's at all realistic.''
   The governor's action was endorsed by Richard Manley, head of
the business-backed Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, and by
Democratic legislative leaders.
   Republican leaders, while acknowledging the need for cuts, said
the move was too little, too late.
   ``It is my understanding the governor has canceled his trip to
Europe on the theory he recognizes the fiscal crisis. He might do
well to take his European trip and cancel the return flight,'' said
Senate Minority Leader David Locke.
   Dukakis plans to join the European trade mission later this week.
   Flight is on the minds of many residents polled by The Boston
Globe and WBZ-TV. Of 436 voters questioned Aug. 26-30 by telephone,
50 percent said they would not consider leaving if the economy
worsened; 47 percent said they would, and 3 percent said they did
not know.
   One-third of those polled said they are cutting back on
groceries because of the economy, and 30 percent said they worry
about losing their jobs.
   The poll was conducted by KRC Communications Research, which
said it had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 points.

   Mercedes Maximiliana stirs a huge, steaming
pot and wonders how many neighbors its contents will feed. Many
will go hungry, she knows.
   The pot boils over onto a sputtering kerosene stove that is the
prize possession of the ``cocina popular,'' Mrs. Maximiliana's soup
kitchen in Los Rosales, a hillside shantytown.
   Dozens of thin, ragged children wait anxiously around the
thatch-roofed hut in the chill mist of a winter day.
   They at least have a chance of eating. Food prices have
quadrupled in recent weeks and millions of Peruvians go to bed
hungry every night.
   Mrs. Maximiliana's soup kitchen, called Los Revolucionarios (The
Revolutionaries), is one of about 3,000 in Lima organized by rural
migrants who join together to save money on cooking.
   Sixty mothers formed Los Revolucionarios five years ago, and it
feeds nearly 400 people each day.
   ``More keep coming,'' Mrs. Maximiliana said, ``and we have to
turn them away because we have no more food.''
   Roman Catholic Church officials say the soup kitchens serve an
average of 400 people each, compared to 135 a few weeks ago.
   Peru, an impoverished Andean nation of 22 million, is caught in
the double stranglehold of severe economic crisis and its worst
drought of the century.
   When President Alberto Fujimori took office July 28, he
inherited annual inflation of 3,000 percent and disastrous
unemployment. Only one of five Peruvians has a steady job.
   Fujimori imposed austerity measures, including elimination of
subsidies on staple foods, to curb inflation. That was what drove
prices up.
   To help the poorest survive, the government created an emergency
food aid program to provide relief for an estimated 7 million
Peruvians. Officials now say the number needing help has risen to
11.5 million.
   Officials said aid would be channeled through soup kitchens,
religious organizations and neighborhood groups that administer a
government program to give each needy child a free glass of milk a
day.
   Church organizations say they get only a fraction of the help
they need.
   ``The Health Ministry isn't paying salaries,'' said Josephine
Gilman, director of Prisma, a church-affiliated charity. ``Health
workers are threatening to steal the food they're supposed to
distribute.''
   Over the chaotic scene hangs the specter of malnutrition.
``Cocina popular'' meals, often thin soups of rice and vegetables
with a minimum of meat or fish, are not very nourishing.
   A nutritional research center called Alternative says the meals
provide only 473 calories and 16 grams of protein, far short of the
basic daily requirements of 2,410 calories and 65 grams of protein.
   In one soup kitchen in the Santa Rosa de Naranjal shantytown,
two women chopped up 4{ pounds of beef, a luxury.
   ``It has to stretch for 200 portions of soup,'' one said.
   Standing nearby were children with bleached hair and swollen
bellies, the marks of malnutrition and parasites.
   UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, says 128 of every
1,000 Peruvian children die before age 5, a level comparable to
some African countries.
   Santa Rosa de Naranjal receives 55 pounds of fish a day for 600
people and a week's worth of flour must last a month. The 15 cents
the kitchens charge for a meal does little to supplement the skimpy
government donations.
   Peru's barely functional bureaucracy makes things worse.
Transport problems and bickering between Customs and Health
Ministry officials have stranded thousands of tons of donated food
in warehouses at Lima's port of Callao, where it falls prey to rats
and mold.
   The bankrupt state oil company will not supply kerosene to the
soup kitchens, as its part in the emergency program, unless the
government pays for it. The state food company has run out of money
to finance the milk program.
   Tomas Alcedo of the relief agency CARE said government aid is
disorganized and ``just isn't big enough to deal with the problem.''
   Peruvians joke bitterly of suffering the biblical plagues: the
drought, a major earthquake in the jungle in June, even locusts. A
volcano near the southern city of Arequipa is threatening to erupt.
   Outside a government-run soup kitchen in Lima's decaying
downtown, thousands of people line up every day at 8 a.m. The
kitchen's budget has been halved to 1,500 rations a day and
thousands are turned away.
   Lunch is thin fare _ wheat soup, a tiny piece of fish and rice _
but people scuffle to get into line for it. Two policemen with
automatic weapons enforce the closing of the doors at 1 p.m.
   ``There should be preference for babies,'' said a toothless
father who had waited five hours in vain with his thin, 3-month-old
daughter in his arms.
   ``She hasn't eaten today.''

<HEAD>Mystery Shrouds Disappearance of American Priest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATTICALOA, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Eugene Hebert, an American
Jesuit, was riding down the road on his red motorscooter Aug. 15
and a Red Cross nurse waved at him from a passing van. He has not
been seen since.
   Almost any groups involved in the chaos of Sri Lanka's communal
hatreds and savage civil war might be responsible for his
disappearance.
   Hundreds of people were killed on Sri Lanka's east coast during
August in ethnic slaughter among Tamils, Moslems and Sinhalese.
   Father Hebert, neither participant nor bystander, got caught in
the middle.
   When last seen, the 67-year-old priest was returning the
technical school at St. Michael's College in Batticaloa, 135 miles
east of Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka.
   Bertram Francis, a Tamil student, was riding on the passenger
seat. The nurse waved to them 12 to 15 miles outside the town.
   The Rev. Harry Miller, a fellow Jesuit who came here with Hebert
42 years ago, said this is what he thinks happened: ``There was
someone, somewhere who took exception to this Tamil boy and tried
to take him away. Father Hebert, being what he was, defended the
boy to the death.''
   A U.S. diplomat described Hebert, one of five foreign priests at
St. Michael's, as the first American casualty of the 7-year-old
civil war. He is presumed dead, although neither his body nor the
scooter has been found.
   About 400 people, most of them Tamils, have been reported
missing in this eastern district in the new round of ethnic war
that began in June, Miller said. He accused the army in Hebert's
case, but said he believed it was a tragic blunder.
   Hebert arrived in Sri Lanka from Jennings, La., in 1948, the
year the paradise island then known as Ceylon became independent of
Britain. He was a teacher, parish priest, director of the technical
school and the toughest basketball coach in the country.
   Some army officers called him ``a white Tiger'' because he
interceded for Tamil youths detained on suspicion of aiding
guerrillas of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   ``He was a very popular man in this area,'' a Tamil businessman
said. ``He was the only priest who wouldn't get off his bike at an
army checkpoint.''
   Hebert ``always had a strong conviction that he was safe,''
Miller said.
   A few days before his disappearance, after a Tamil priest was
stoned and beaten by a Moslem mob, Hebert turned to Miller and
another priest and said: ``You know, sooner or later one of us will
go (be killed).''
   When the conflict between the Sinhalese, who dominate Sri Lanka,
and the minority Tamils became acute in the early 1980s, Hebert and
some other Roman Catholic priests warned of a bloodbath and
counseled conciliation.
   The Tamils, 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, claim
discrimination by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent.
   Since fighting resumed June 11, the army has regained control of
the towns and most roads in the east, conceding the jungle and
remote villages to the Tigers.
   In Batticaloa, a town of 40,000 Tamils between the sea and a
lagoon, life deteriorated after the army took over, according to
Miller and Tamil residents.
   Schools are shut. Most Tamil-owned businesses are closed and
others open only in the mornings.
   Food is scarce and arrives only sporadically by truck convoy.
People stay indoors after 2 p.m. in a voluntary curfew born of fear.
   Young Tamils dread what they call arbitrary arrest. Dozens of
unidentifiable bodies have been seen burning in the streets.
   A senior army officer, who spoke in an unauthorized interview
and refused to let his name be used, denied any impropriety. He
said the bodies of Tigers killed in skirmishes were burned because
there was no one to bury them.
   While a reporter was visiting a Tamil politician, soldiers
entered the house, searched it, checked the identity papers of his
employees and took a 19-year-old away for questioning. The youth
was released soon afterward.
   Moslems and Tamils often live in adjacent villages outside
Batticaloa. They speak the same language and, apart from religion,
share the same culture.
   Most Tamils are Hindus, but many in the Batticaloa area are
Christians. Except for occasional trouble that began about two
years ago, the Tamils and Moslems had lived together harmoniously.
   The resumption of war in June began a period of brutality,
including decapitation and mutilation, that has exceeded anything
before it.
   Different sides trace it to different events and each community
professes innocence.
   One of the worst massacres took place Aug. 11 in Eravur, a
Moslem village just north of Batticaloa. Attackers suspected of
being Tigers killed 127 people by shooting or hacking them to death.
   Four days later, Eravur was on Hebert's route home to Batticaloa
from Valachchenai, 15 miles north, where he met with Tamil priests
and nuns who felt threatened by the violence.
   Tamils, fleeing Moslem vengeance and army arrests, had abandoned
the villages between Eravur and Valachchenai and there was no
traffic on the road, Miller said.
   ``At first, everyone concluded it was the Moslems who killed
him. Now I don't think so,'' he said. If the Moslems were
responsible, Miller added, it would have been another incident of
mob violence and could not be kept secret.
   ``He never got to Eravur,'' Hebert's friend said. ``There was
only one other operating agent in that area, and that is the
army,'' he said.
   Military officials said a convoy had been expected that day and
soldiers were stationed every few hundred yards along the road.

   An unlikely history and lingering mystery mingle
in a song that infused the old, rural South, emerged in the civil
rights movement, gained popularity and now has advanced into the
loftiest hymnals.
   Aspects of the song, ``Amazing Grace,'' are somewhat amazing
themselves, and haunting.
   ``There's a kind of wonderful calm that I feel when I sing this,
a kind of uncomplicated feeling, the way one felt as a child,''
says operatic contralto Jessye Norman.
   Country singer Johnny Cash says it's ``a song with no guile . .
. straight-ahead, honest, gut-level and heart-level. When I sing
that song, I could be in a dungeon, or I could have chains all over
me, but I'd be free as a breeze.''
   The lyrics were by a reformed 18th-century slave trader, the
variable melody clouded in folk origins, conceivably among slaves.
It imbued their ensuing culture and later spread through a
sophisticated world.
   Now a favorite American hymn, ``Amazing Grace'' also turns up
occasionally in rock concerts, and has been rendered in some
foreign languages.
   ``There is a power of reconciliation that takes place when I
hear it,'' says broadcaster Bill Moyers, who depicts the story and
impact of the hymn in an 80-minute show being presented Wednesday
by the Public Broadcasting Service.
   The first verse goes: ``Amazing grace! How sweet the sound, that
saved a wretch like me! I once was lost but now am found, was blind
but now I see.''
   The words were by John Newton, skipper of a British slave ship
who traded for human cargo in West Africa. A storm at sea sparked
religious faith and he later became an Anglican minister in Olney,
England.
   ``I was once an active instrument in a business at which my
heart now shudders,'' Newton wrote in his journals. ``A common
drunkard or profligate is a petty sinner to what I was . . . Oh, to
grace how great a debtor.''
   Newton became an advocate for abolishing the slave trade. His
journals describing its brutality helped an ally, William
Wilberforce, win British abolition of it.
   `` 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears
relieved,'' goes the second verse. ``How precious did that grace
appear the hour I first believed.''
   In the film, singer Judy Collins says:
   ``It was always the song that gave me an inner experience of
another dimension. I always feel that there's a mystical territory
between me and the audience.
   ``It's not just me singing . . . Somewhere or other, there is
some experience going on which gives something to them and gives
something to me, that's more than the sum of any of us.''
   The third verse goes, ``The Lord has promised good to me, his
word my hope secures; he will my shield and portion be as long as
life endures.''
   Says gospel singer Marion Williams: ``It gets to most everybody.
It gets to the heart of men.''
   An aged black ``wiregrass'' song leader, Dewey Williams, says at
his 91st birthday party in Ozark, Ark.: ``I feel good, I just can't
help it when I get to singing (that song). It just do something to
me.''
   The show ranges over many settings, from 18th-century sailing
ships to concert halls, from prisons to Mississippi voter
registration drives, from cemeteries to ``shape note'' singing in
Holly Springs, Ga.
   Says a Holly Springs man, ``It's just a good song, wrote like
it's supposed to be wrote.''
   On a tour of Japan by the Boys Choir of Harlem, director Walter
Turnbull says some foreigners don't understand the song's words,
``but it has such a universal flavor and the meldoy itself is so
beautiful it captures people.''
   The fourth verse goes, ``Through many dangers, toils, and
snares, I have already come; 'Tis grace that brought me safe thus
far, and grace will lead me home.''
   In a Huntsville, Texas, prison, an inmate says: ``I couldn't
hardly sing that song and get through, you know, four verses of it
without choking up . . . all I could do was just be humming and
crying.''
   Shown engraved on Newton's tombstone are his words:
   ``Once an infidel and libertine, a servant of slaves in Africa,
was by the rich mercy of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
preserved, restored, pardoned and appointed to preach the faith he
had long labored to destroy.''
   The fifth verse goes, ``When we've been there ten thousand
years, bright shining as the sun, we've no less days to sing God's
praise than when we'd first begun.''
   A Harlem choir boy says of his reaction to the song:
   ``I feel like I'm walking on a beach, and like wind is hitting
me, and stuff like that. That's how I feel about it. Not like a
rough wind; like a soft wind, just coming by, like a breeze.''

<HEAD>The Changing Mission of Jesse Jackson</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In his latest role, Jesse Jackson describes
himself as a journalist with a mission. In other callings _ civil
rights activist, contender for Democratic presidential nominations,
candidate to be an unpaid ``shadow senator'' for the District of
Columbia _ journalists cover his missions.
   Jackson went to Iraq to interview Saddam Hussein, then gained
entry to Kuwait on his first outing as a television interviewer. He
flew home Sunday with 47 Americans who had been held hostage there.
One of them said that but for Jackson's intercession, they would
not be free. The White House concurred, a spokesman praising
Jackson's effort and saying the administration had cooperated.
   That blurring of the roles of interviewer, hostage negotiator
and free-lance diplomat fits the pattern of a Persian Gulf crisis
in which television is part of the weaponry. Ironically, Jackson
himself complained about live television diplomacy, saying
diplomats should be negotiating directly, not arguing
electronically.
   ``If talking is impossible, then war becomes inevitable,'' he
said in the first of four ``Inside Edition'' programs based on his
trip to Iraq. That's only a preview of the televised Jackson. His
own, syndicated talk show is to begin later this month. A rival TV
syndicator paid $125,000 to send Jackson and a crew of 14 on the
trip to Iraq after he had shopped among other organizations and
networks for sponsorship.
   ``I am fundamentally a communicator, and journalism is
communication,'' Jackson said Sunday. ``I do not believe in
abstract journalism; it has to have a mission.''
   Jackson's own missions are multiple, and hard to classify. He is
The Rev. Jesse Jackson. He heads the Rainbow Coalition. He
intercedes in labor disputes, crusades against drugs, mounts
boycotts against businesses deemed to be shirking in the
advancement of black employees and executives.
   He has run twice for the Democratic presidential nomination, and
early surveys show his wide name recognition places him in the
front rank of prospects for the 1992 campaign.
   Jackson isn't saying what he'll do then. As a champion of
statehood for the District of Columbia, he is running now to be one
of the two ``shadow senators'' who will be official lobbyists for
that cause. There are four candidates and a Jackson victory is a
near certainty. Another is that the Capital won't become a state
any time soon.
   A plan to appropriate $1.3 million in city funds to pay salaries
and office expenses for the shadow senators was scrapped because of
the budget crunch. So the job won't pay a salary, nor will it
provide the Senate floor access that Jackson had hoped to gain.
   Then again, Jackson doesn't seem to need a position or a title
in order to promote his causes, his image and his political aims.
He's been doing it for years, at home and abroad, meeting with the
heads of more than 60 governments.
   Self-starting diplomats sometimes have irked prior
administrations, but there was no overt sign of it this time _
although Jackson had claimed at one point that the government was
trying to discourage sponsorship of his trip.
   ``. . . The president is pleased by Jesse's success in bringing
back Americans, and we are grateful that he was able to make those
arrangements,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
``. . . He was successful, and that's important. He did get
American lives out. We did cooperate.''
   In January 1984, Jackson had negotiated the release of a Navy
pilot held by Syria after his jet was shot down during a raid on
Syrian antiaircraft positions in the mountains of Lebanon.
   He said relatives of Iraqi hostages had contacted him for help,
looking to him because he had succeeded before.
   When he flew home with Navy Lt. Robert O. Goodman Jr. in 1984,
one of the reporters who traveled with them was Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. Anderson
himself was taken hostage in Beirut in March 1985, and has been
held since, longer than any other Western hostage in Lebanon.

   Buying a home is supposed to be the American
dream. For many people, that dream has been dampened by the effects
of the savings and loan crisis, which has made victims of both
buyers and sellers. This, the second of a three-part series, ``S&amp;Ls
on Main Street,'' examines how the crisis has battered one
mid-sized city.

<TEXT>
   In many places, the savings and
loan crisis seems a far-off fury: unknown people swindling faceless
institutions in complicated ways with vague consequences.
   But in Colorado Springs, as in many cities across the country,
the consequences have undermined everyday life by exacerbating an
already depressed economy.
   Three of the six local S&amp;Ls went under this year; a surviving
thrift seeks to reassure listeners in its radio ads that ``we've
been in business over 70 years.'' Sale signs in suburban yards
proclaim ``bank-owned.'' Headlines in the real estate section
scream ``REPO!''
   Some people can't get out of their homes. Some can't get into
homes. Sellers have to swallow bigger losses because prices are
depressed by the huge inventory of government-owned homes hanging
over the market. Buyers have trouble getting mortgages because
money is tight, qualifying is harder and rules are much stricter.
   The S&amp;L crisis, says National Association of Home Builders
economist Dean Crist, is ``hitting Main Street now.''
   In the mid-1980s, Colorado Springs exploded as a high tech, high
rollin' military mecca that grew from 214,000 residents in 1980 to
about 300,000 before the energy and defense booms went bust in the
late '80s.
   Overbuilt and over-appraised, commercial and residential real
estate prices dropped through the basement. Developers simply
walked away from their debts. So did homeowners caught in the
squeeze between lost jobs and high mortgages. Their houses were
repossessed by banks, S&amp;Ls or the federal government.
   This year, three S&amp;Ls were taken over by government regulators.
Two were sold; one simply was shut down when no one offered to buy
it. And the repossessed properties settled into government hands.
   Today, government agencies estimate they are offering for sale
as many as 2,200 single-family houses in the area. That's almost
half the 4,620 single-family homes listed for sale by the Pike's
Peak Association of Realtors Multiple-Listing Service at the end of
August.
   Steve Barron, a local realtor, said the S&amp;L crisis didn't cause
the depressed market in Colorado Springs _ but it added to it.
   ``What the S&amp;Ls did was make money available for building on a
speculative basis,'' said Barron. ``They loaned money at 100
percent rather than force a down payment. All that overbuilding is
what you see now.''
   ``The S&amp;L crisis has lowered market values throughout the
city,'' said realtor Cliff Snyder.
   Barron views it as an opportunity for some people who were shut
out of the housing market because of inflated prices during the
1980s heyday.
   ``The S&amp;L collapse has created a window of opportunity for
people who couldn't buy in back in '87,'' he said. ``Houses are as
low now as they're ever going to get. This chance will never come
again.''
   But the veteran realtor acknowledges that the S&amp;L crisis,
coupled with a sluggish national economy and Colorado Springs'
overdevelopment, has changed the way he and his colleagues approach
clients.
   ``The real estate community as a whole is much more cautious
about the way they do business. When they represent the seller,
they insist on a job history and a credit report on the buyer,''
Barron said.
   ``Heck, in the 1980s, if a buyer had a pulse he qualified. Now
it's gone to the other extreme,'' he said.
   ``We're looking at a lot of retrenching. It's much tighter now,
much tougher to buy a home,'' said Charles Grayson, a banker in
Colorado Springs.
   Judy and Dave Crenshaw can testify to that. They had to go to
three different mortgage companies and deal with two government
agencies before they finally were able to buy a home here.
   ``The government has tightened their belts so extremely that it
has made it very difficult for people like us,'' said Mrs.
Crenshaw. ``We got caught in the squeeze.''
   The Crenshaws lost out on one home because an appraisal fell
more than $11,000 short of the loan they were seeking. ``That
appraisal really did us in,'' she said, with disgust. ``It was very
stressful for us.''
   Two months later, they bought a new two-story home with a full
basement for $80,000. Even that wasn't easy.
   ``It took us three or four weeks longer to get the house than we
expected, and cost us more money because of the delay,'' said Mrs.
Crenshaw, a civil service employee at the Fort Carson Army hospital.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency established to
sell properties acquired through failed S&amp;Ls, requires buyers in
Colorado Springs to spend an extra $25 for credit counseling.
   With such fierce competition in the marketplace, Barron said,
that extra fee might make the difference between selling an RTC
home and one just like it down the block, offered by a private
buyer and financed by a mortgage lender who doesn't charge for
advice.
   ``We're talking about buyers without a lot of disposable
income,'' said Barron. ``Why should they have to pay $25 to RTC for
something they can get free someplace else?''
   Barron will not take his buyers to any S&amp;L for financial
assistance. Too unstable, too many hassles, too risky, he said.
   ``Why add to the trauma and stress with a technically
incompetent or unstable lender? It's a question of confidence. Will
they still be there next week?'' said Barron. ``I don't know
anybody in my office using a savings and loan regularly today.''
   Kerry Wanner concurs.
   ``Word is spreading among brokers and agents,'' said Wanner, a
broker. ``We're bottom-line people. When you go to an S&amp;L and you
can't get the job done, you don't go there anymore.''

   Some Americans are struggling to buy homes due
to fallout from the savings and loan crisis, but the mess has made
the federal government the owner of some ritzy properties.

   English tea is served under ceilings
decorated with gold leaf. Marble bathrooms have speakers for
television sound. A pool is lined with mother-of-pearl tile.
Five-foot-tall rare porcelain vases stand guard at the entrance to
a French restaurant. Employees stand in hallways just to answer any
questions that might happen by.
   To some, the Phoenician resort epitomizes excellence. To others,
it is a monument to excess and extravagance paid for by the
now-insolvent Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.
   But for anyone who spends a night there, it's hard to believe
this $275 million desert oasis actually is a government-owned and
operated property.
   ``If the government's running it, they're doing a wonderful job.
I'd say this is one of their more successful ventures,'' Frederick
Shaw, a Westfield, N.J., physician, said with a chuckle. ``It's the
nicest resort I've ever stayed in.''
   ``Club Fed,'' as it is called locally, was seized by FBI agents
last November after federal regulators took over Lincoln from
Charles Keating, the Phoenix developer blamed for one of the
costliest of all S&amp;L failures.
   As if the Phoenician's ownership wasn't troublesome enough,
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait created some figurative ripples through
the seven swimming pools here, too.
   Lincoln Savings owned 55 percent of the resort _ the share now
in the hands of the federal Resolution Trust Corp. The London-based
Kuwait Investment Office owns the remaining 45 percent.
   ``They assured us the investment is secure,'' Phoenician
spokeswoman Sally Cooper said of the Kuwaitis.
   The U.S. government continues to run the palm-filled oasis,
hiring an Austrian hotelier to manage the 130-acre resort until a
buyer can be found.
   No attempt has been made to sell the hotel because of pending
litigation, and the Kuwaitis have the first right of refusal, RTC
spokesman Kevin Shields said.
   The Phoenician is one of the best-known of all the thousands of
properties now in the hands of the federal government, acquired
through failed S&amp;Ls.
   It became both a symbol of the S&amp;L excess, and a battleground
for Keating, who claims S&amp;L regulators didn't understand his
business and conspired to ruin his deals.
   Regulators, for their part, claim Keating looted Lincoln
Savings, using it as his own piggy bank to finance a lavish
lifestyle for his family and build speculative ``white elephant''
projects like the resort, which they say has lost millions since
its October 1988 opening.
   ``It's very opulent and extravagant,'' Shields said. ``This is
not something S&amp;Ls should go around building.''
   So heated is the feud between Keating and regulators that when
the government ousted Keating's management of the Phoenician, FBI
agents confiscated documents and changed the locks on the doors.
   Phoenician management now says the resort is breaking even on a
cash-flow basis. But that's not a true picture, the RTC says,
because the Phoenician's balance sheet carries no debt _ Lincoln
footed the $275 million bill for building the resort.
   ``The question is, can it really make a profit?'' Shields said.
``What price will we be able to sell it in order for the buyer to
make it profitable?''
   While all the wrangling has gone on, few if any reservations
have been canceled because of the mess.
   ``Really, all of this has not had any adverse effect. If
anything, curiosity was piqued,'' said Ms. Cooper.
   Dennis Beljan was curious. He and his wife came from nearby
Mesa, Ariz., for a golf holiday because ``I knew it was supposed to
be a super property.''
   ``It exceeds some of the higher quality resorts in the area,''
Beljan said. ``You don't feel any government presence at all.''

   The United Church of Christ, which traces its
origins to the New England Pilgrims and Puritans, wants to reclaim
the evangelizing characteristics of its roots.
   The church is launching a three-year program of ``Evangelism
Institutes'' across the country, with the first sessions in
September in Texas and Louisiana.
   The Revs. Alan Johnson and Martie Swan, who coordinate the
program for the denomination's Board of Homeland Ministries, said:
``We need to make evangelism `acceptable' among mainliners, to
reclaim the name and the practice from our heritage rather than
dismissing it as something someone else does.''
   Like other mainline denominations, the United Church of Christ
has lost members since 1965, its rolls shrinking to 1.64 million
from 2.07 million. The church's last general synod set evangelism
and growth as a priority.
   In the new program, institutes are to be held in 15 regions to
train clergy and laity in evangelizing methods such as Bible study,
talking to others about faith, and attracting and welcoming people
to church.

   One hundred and fifty years of dinners at
Antoine's hardly show at all _ and that's the way everyone likes it.
   Sure, the gas jets in the old brass chandeliers have given way
to electricity, and the ceiling fans now stir air-conditioned
breezes on muggy days. But if Antoine Alciatore were to walk in
today, he'd find the biggest change is in the clientele.
   ``On any given night, I'd say we have someone worth writing
about in here _ someone famous, or notorious _ many people who are
intriguing,'' said Bernard R. Guste, proprietor of the famous
French Quarter restaurant. ``It's like home for a lot of the people
who come here. When they want a good meal, they want to come home.
We keep it pretty much the way it's always been.''
   Started as a modest rooming house and restaurant when it opened
in 1840, Antonie's has become a hallmark of excellent food and
elegant dining in a city where both are revered.
   Just a couple of blocks from the blare of Bourbon Street, where
jazz bars vie with strip joints, Antoine's draws local residents,
tourists and the rich and famous.
   Some diners over the years: seven American presidents; royalty,
including Princess Margaret, Princess Anne and the Duke and Duchess
of Windsor; writers such as Mark Twain, Sinclair Lewis and William
Faulkner; entertainers, from Sarah Bernhardt to Groucho Marx to
Linda Ronstadt; and sports celebrities, including Babe Ruth, Jack
Nicklaus and Joe Montana.
   When Pope John Paul II visited New Orleans in 1988, Guste and
three of Antoine's waiters were chosen to cook for him and serve
him at the archbishop's residence.
   ``He was the nicest fellow you could ever meet,'' said Wiley
Smith, who has been a waiter at Antoine's for 43 years. ``All these
big people are nice. It's a education in itself to be at Antoine's.
I always say, `I could have traveled the world three times over and
not met all the people I've met here.' ''
   Smith, 65, should know. He served Harry Truman when he dined at
Antoine's, and Richard Nixon as well.
   He shrugs off the list of celebrities; it's too long to itemize.
   ``I like serving the young people who come in,'' he said.
``They're so enthusiastic. You know it's a big night for them, and
it will be a special memory. I like that.''
   The 33 waiters at Antoine's have 875 years total years'
experience, Guste said, most of it with his restaurant.
   ``Our young waiters start as apprentices to our older waiters.
It's a role model thing. I tell them, `You start to walk and talk
and think like this man and you'll make it,' '' Guste said.
   Regulars at Antoine's have their own personal waiters who serve
them each time they visit, and whose names they drop when making
reservations.
   ``It's sort of like having your own doctor,'' Guste said. ``They
know how you like your sauce, if you want ice cubes, how much bread
to put on your table. You don't have to ask. The man serving you
probably served your father and maybe your grandfather.''
   Guste, 42, who started working at Antoine's in 1967 as a
cashier, is the great-great grandson of Antoine Alciatore. For five
generations, he said, the restaurant never has been open without a
family member present, making it what he calls the oldest
restaurant in the United States operated by the same family.
   If you're looking for modern dishes, ``light'' food, are
counting calories or concerned about cholesterol, Antoine's is
definitely a place to avoid.
   The French Creole cuisine dished out in the restaurant's 16
private dining rooms hasn't varied much during the last 150 years.
   The dishes on the menu, which is written in French, are
generously covered with butter and cream, bearnaise sauce with its
nine egg yolks, cream sauce made with a quart of half-and-half, and
Rochambeau sauce with almost a cup of butter.
   The recipe for Oysters Rockefeller, perhaps the most famous dish
at Antoine's, is a family secret, reportedly stashed in a vault in
the restaurant, but the taste is well-known: Almost 3 million
orders have been served.
   The restaurant's wine cellar contains more than 25,000 bottles.
The oldest wines date from 1884; a brandy was produced in 1811.
   ``Prohibition was tough on the restaurant,'' Guste said. ``Our
type of food calls for wine. My grandfather thought it was terrible
when customers had to have water instead.''
   ``Dinner at Antoine's'' is not only the name of a Frances
Parkinson Keyes novel. For those who can afford the tab _ $30 to
$50 without wine or tip _ it's an experience, Guste said.
   Reserve early, though. Regulars have standing reservations from
year to year for holidays like New Year's Eve, Christmas Eve and
Mardi Gras, and two of the dining rooms _ the Japanese Room and the
1890 Room _ already have been reserved for New Year's Eve 1999 for
turn-of-the-century parties.

   Sometimes, when the pain in her belly and
her toothpick-thin legs tears at her, Lissette Rodriguez thinks of
heaven.
   ``When mom dies, I die, everyone dies, I can walk in there,''
she says in her frail voice. ``No pain in my stomach, no pain in my
knee, and I walk again.''
   Sometimes, her chest feels so tight she can't breathe.
Sometimes, those who love her can't hold her because her 40-pound
body is so brittle that she bleeds inside.
   In these excruciating moments, Sandy, as she is nicknamed,
prays. She asks God to take the pain away.
   Barely 12 years old, Sandy is dying of AIDS. For her, death is
represented by the concept of heaven, where everything is beautiful.
   ``You close your eyes and your body is not working,'' she says.
``Then you go to God, go to Jesus in a big place where he lives. My
father is in there. Everyone who dies goes there.''
   Sandy's doctor, Dr. Laura Hoyt, said every part of the girl's
body, from her head to her toes, is not working properly: her
brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, blood, immune system.
   ``We've had her on hospice care at home since last spring,'' the
doctor said. ``We are keeping her as comfortable as possible for as
long as possible. She hates being in the hospital and doesn't want
to die in the hospital.''
   Sandy is among the nearly 2,500 children under 13 who have
contracted full-blown AIDS since the epidemic began. The Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta reported in August that more than
1,300 of those children have died in the United States and its
territories.
   Sandy was born four weeks prematurely in New York City. The
woman she knows as her mother, Carmen Candelaria, is really her
aunt. Mrs. Candelaria took Sandy and another child from her own
sister when they were born because the sister was unable to care
for them.
   Sandy contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion needed because
of her early birth, Mrs. Candelaria said. The girl's natural mother
died two years ago, at age 41, after mixing Valium and alcohol at a
party, she said.
   Mrs. Candelaria said she knows nothing about Sandy's father. Her
own husband, the man Sandy knew as her father, was killed when
Sandy was 7 in a holdup in the video store he owned in Puerto Rico,
where they lived for five years.
   ``I miss my father,'' Sandy says. ``I miss him every day, every
night.''
   Sandy hasn't walked since last December. She spent from
Christmas through March in the hospital, and watched her friend
Christina from Puerto Rico die of AIDS on New Year's Eve.
   ``I was scared,'' she says. ``Soon, her eyes were closed. Her
mother is crying. Her father is crying. I started crying. I said,
`I want to see her.' She was covered. Her hair was a mess, all
gone. I miss her. She's gone to heaven. She moved from the islands
to God.''
   Mrs. Candelaria threw a big barbecue May 1 for Sandy's 12th
birthday and invited the people at the hospital who care for her.
   Sandy, who weighed 60 pounds then, mustered the strength to blow
out the candles and got icing on her nose.
   She celebrated her first communion not in a church, but in the
hospital, where she returned at the end of May when her condition
worsened.
   For Mrs. Candelaria, it was bittersweet. She is tormented by the
picture in her mind. She is unable to shake the image of a little
girl with brown hair and eyes, white lace dress and stockings,
locket around her tiny neck, in a wheelchair surrounded by nurses,
a cake decorated with the sentiments, ``Jesus Loves Lissette. We
Do, Too.''
   ``I just got sad,'' said Mrs. Candelaria. ``I wanted it to be
not in the hospital, but a real normal communion. She told me not
to cry, if I cry, she'll cry.'' They both cried.
   Sandy is attached to Mrs. Candelaria, wanting her there every
moment, even sleeping with her. Mrs. Candelaria is her shadow and
has devoted much of her life to caring for her.
   She is Mrs. Candelaria's protector, never talking to her about
the inevitable.
   ``She knows,'' Mrs. Candelaria said. ``She never talks to me
about dying. She sees me cry too many times.''
   Each day brings a new onslaught of pain for Sandy: diarrhea,
coughing, fever, fungus, itching. Her black-and-blue body is
replenished with new blood every month, transfusions to keep her
alive and platelets to help stem the disease's tide.
   A hug, a kiss, a banged foot can start internal bleeding.
   ``I have a pain in here,'' Sandy says, rubbing her stomach.
``Sometimes I throw it up. Sometimes I get mad at Doreen.''
   Doreen Small, her devoted nurse, said Sandy always fights with
her:
   ``Then she says she's sorry. I'm the focus of her anger, which
is OK. When she's in a good mood, she'll paint pictures for me. I
have a bunch of pictures.''
   A luxury for Sandy is to have her feet rubbed. She asks anyone
who is handy to accommodate her. When her cousin Lues Rivera
jokingly threatened to stop one day, she teased him in Spanish, ``I
dare you.''
   Sandy is a prisoner of her bed, cared for at home by her mother
and the Center For Hope Hospice.
   ``Don't put me in there yet,'' she orders Ms. Small, afraid she
may never get back out to do all the things she wants.
   Her bedroom is filled with a cabinet of survival gear: sterile
water, saline, gauze, diapers, dressing kits, needles to flush her
IV.
   Her link to life is a catheter that enters her chest, nourishing
her with food, vitamins, minerals and dextrose. The thrush
infection from her mouth to her stomach and the medicine have
killed her appetite.
   ``Sometimes the food at the hospital I don't like it,'' she
says. A treat for her is pizza and french fries, but she can handle
only a few bites.
   Her constant companions are her make-believe friend, Poopy, who
takes her shopping, a doll called Baby Bubbles, whom she hugs and
rocks, and the telephone. She frequently calls Poopy to take her
shopping and to chitchat. ``I want to see my grandmother and cousin
... You see the movie `Mermaid?' I like the sound.''
   ``When you think how limited her life is, that's her only
contact to the outside world,'' said Ms. Small.
   Her dreams are simple: to get out of her bed, to go to school,
to see her classmates and the New Kids on the Block, to have
another party, to fly to Puerto Rico to visit her grandmother, to
see the clouds from the plane.
   ``I don't want to die, never, never,'' she cries. ``I want to
live.''

   It's an oasis of gentility, a bastion of British
tradition, a purveyor of the national drink. Shepherd's Tea Room is
also part of a renaissance. Tea never fell out of favor in England,
but tea rooms did. Now they're coming back.

<TEXT>
   In a country that takes its tea
seriously, Shepherd's Tea Room gets top marks from the industry
insiders at home as well as from an innocent abroad, my mother.
   From among thousands of tea shops across England, this oasis of
gentility was given the 1990 Top Tea Place of the Year Award by The
Tea Council Limited, which represents British tea packagers and
distributors as well as six other tea-producing countries.
   Perhaps more impressive to me was the reaction of my vacationing
mother, who lives in Texas where tea means ICED tea and people who
drink it hot are suspicioned as foreigners. She put Shepherd's
right up there with Buckingham Palace, Parliament and the Tower
Bridge as fun places to visit.
   ``It's so quaint,'' said mother, Lorrain Rubin of Houston. ``And
how civilized to stop for tea in the late afternoon.''
   Beyond the bright purple door of the stately red-brick Georgian
home, Shepherd's Tea Room is a vision of pale pink walls, flowers
and lace tablecloths. An aria from a French opera plays faintly
beneath soft conversations.
   A well-groomed young waiter escorts us to a table in a sunny
room and mother says, ``I like this place. Everyone here is my
age.''
   At one table, four gray-haired ladies in sensible shoes discuss
the thoroughbreds racing in the day's Glorious Goodwood, an annual
event for England's horsey aristocracy. A group of young women with
well-behaved children sit on our right, a gentleman reading The
Times of London to our left.
   The tea room on London Street serves 700 pots of tea a week to
customers, most of whom are regulars.
   ``We get lots of older single ladies,'' says the proprietor,
Richard Spence, 32. ``They know that even if they come alone they
will find companions with whom to have a nice chat.''
   Indeed, the tea room has become an institution in this ancient
town noted for its Georgian architecture and fine harbor for
sailing enthusiasts, located on an estuary on England's southern
coast, about 55 miles south of London.
   Richard's wife and co-owner, Yvonne, adds, ``One chap said his
mother comes because the people she will find here are people she
would have in her front parlor. It's a safe place.''
   Tea rooms always have been a haven for women. A century ago,
they were just about the only public place a lady could venture
unchaperoned and maintain a good reputation.
   The first recorded English tea room was a woman's idea. In 1864,
the manager of a bread shop near London Bridge started serving tea
to her favorite customers and before long everyone wanted some.
   The idea brewed a while, and then she asked the bakery directors
if she could sell pots of tea with scones. The result was a
smashing success. Tea shops became a part of the nation's heritage
and part of every Englishman's childhood.
   No Saturday shopping trip was complete without a stop for tea
and scones. Afternoon tea dances held in London after the World War
I attracted crowds.
   The Spences bought their tea room in 1987, six months after they
were married. Both had been managers for large hotel chains but
wanted to do something together.
   They added the lace, bought modern white bone china and revamped
the menu. Traditional English dishes such as Welsh rarebit and
Ploughman's platters are now served alongside healthy salads,
sandwiches and filled baked potatoes.
   Mother ordered rarebit and I chose a savory meat lasagne, a dish
I loved as a child.
   ``How's your lasagne?'' mother asked.
   ``It's really good,'' I replied, ``but not as good as yours.''
   She smiled and finished lunch with a slice of rich chocolate
mousse cake. I chose the treacle tart and whipped cream from among
a refrigerated case of homemade shortbread, iced tea cakes, walnut
layer cake, rice crispy squares and caramel bars.
   Then we had tea, a pot of spicy China Black for her and a peach
fruit tea for me.
   The tea was delicious, tasting nothing like common American tea
that is brewed fromnd often tastes slightly bitter
and stewed.
   Shepherd's also serves Earl Grey, Darjeeling, Ceylon Afternoon
Tea, camomile, lemon, kiwi and blackcurrant teas. The man who sells

Council this year were:
   The Commodore Hotel in Instow, Devon; The Tea Shoppe in  Hutchison

<TEXT>
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam
beams and waves to the masses from a huge billboard in Addis
Ababa's main square.
   Beneath it, a uniformed security guard uses a stick to control
the hundreds of Ethiopians who besiege the Immigration Department
every day for exit visas.
   One of them, the wife of a ranking politician, shares a
whispered joke with a visitor: ``We like to think he's waving
goodbye.''
   Mengistu, who gained power after a military coup toppled Emperor
Haile Selassie in 1974, seems determined to hang on despite
military, diplomatic and economic setbacks.
   Consider his problems:
   _ Two major guerrilla armies have demoralized a military made up
largely of forcibly enlisted youngsters with little training and
less inclination to fight for Mengistu.
   _ After nearly three decades of war, secessionist rebels occupy
nearly all of Eritrea, the northernmost province. A smaller, allied
force holds neighboring Tigre Province and has swept southward to
within 100 miles of the capital.
   _ The Soviet Union, for 13 years Ethiopia's ally and arms
supplier, has withdrawn most of its military advisers, has reduced
weapons shipments and recommends negotiations to settle Ethiopia's
internal conflicts. Cuban advisers also have left.
   _ Ethiopia says the military absorbs half its annual budget. The
economy is in tatters, the arms debt to the Soviet Union is
estimated at $5 billion to $6 billion and Moscow indicates it
expects to be paid. Western nations and international lending
agencies to which Ethiopia owes an additional $2 billion to $3
billion also expect payment.
   _ Famine is an almost constant threat, particularly in the
north, where drought and war have limited harvests for years. More
than 1 million people died in the last great famine, in 1984-85,
and only continuing relief efforts have prevented a repetition.
   ``Anywhere else in the world, a leader confronted with such a
litany of disasters would have bowed out, but our man will brave it
out,'' said an Ethiopian political scientist.
   How long Mengistu can do so may depend on Eritrea. Nearly a
third of his 315,800-man army is under siege in the Eritrean
capital, Asmara, surrounded by rebels of the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front.
   Mengistu has acknowledged the fall of Asmara could bring down
his government. Diplomats in Addis Ababa say he is determined to
hold the provincial capital.
   Dawit Wolde Giorgis, a former Ethiopian official who headed the
relief program in the 1984-85 famine and now lives in New Jersey,
said Mengistu ``has lost control'' of the country, but still
prevails in the capital ``primarily because the opposition
movements are disunited.''
   ``There is no real source of strength in the regime except the
machinery of terror and need for economic survival,'' he said.
``Perhaps 100,000 people'' in the establishment ``are loyal to him
. . . because they know that their life and security depend on the
survival of Mengistu.''
   Goshu Wolde, a former foreign minister now living in Maryland,
said the army could dislodge Mengistu but its main forces are on
the war fronts and ``the military is under surveillance.'' He said
past coup attempts failed for lack of resources and organization.
   Some observers suggest the Eritreans could seize Asmara any time
they chose because they have popular support and most governemnt
soldiers probably would quit fighting.
   Others believe an assault on Asmara might panic the defenders
into burning the elegant garden city, once the capital of Italy's
prized African colony.
   ``I think they'd rather starve it into surrender,'' one analyst
said. ``The commanders would probably fly out before the end and
the city would be wide open.''
   A desire to starve rather than destroy Asmara may lie behind the
rebels' refusal to reopen the nearby port of Massawa, some
diplomats say.
   Massawa, one of Ethiopia's two Red Sea ports, has been idle
since the rebels captured it in early February.
   Two months ago, the United Nations thought it had the agreement
of both the government and rebels to send a damage-inspection team
to Massawa.
   At the last minute, however, the rebels refused entry to the
ship carrying the team. The Eritreans have not explained the
action, but some analysts in Addis Ababa say the rebels may have
feared any food delivered through Massawa would primarily benefit
Mengistu's beseiged 2nd Army.
   An estimated 400,000 civilians live in Asmara and the small
surrounding area still held by the 2nd Army, a force of about
120,000.
   Food is supplied to the civilians by a U.N. airlift from Assab,
Ethiopia's other port far down the coast near Somalia. The
government also flies in arms and food for the soldiers.
   Eritreans outside the besieged area are fed adequately, if not
abundantly, by a relief effort run by the rebels from neighboring
Sudan.
   ``The food is getting into Asmara, but it's not enough and it's
not clear whether the army is laying claim to some of it,'' said a
European diplomat familiar with the U.N. airlift, which began July
1.
   Mengistu responded to the economic crisis earlier this year by
scrapping the Marxist policies his government had followed for 15
years and encouraging foreign investment. Many diplomats say it was
too little too late, and point to signs of increasing corruption
and poverty.
   As the economy deteriorates and the Tigre People's Liberation
Front moves ever southward toward Addis Ababa, residents of the
capital are getting jittery.
   In addition to the long lines at the Immigration Department,
about 100 people a day apply for visas at the U.S. Embassy. Those
with money hoard food, gasoline and water, and the black market in
foreign currencies is brisk.

   In a land of famine and war, the
privileged few feast and frolic.
   Of Ethiopia's 50 million people, one in 15 faces starvation and
at least 8 million are trapped in areas being contested by
government and rebel armies. At the other extreme are the 2,000
diplomats and expatriates, and a few hundred rich Ethiopian
families.
   Although rebels of the Tigre People's Liberation Front have
advanced to within 100 miles of Addis Ababa, there are no signs of
panic among foreigners.
   They play roulette at the Ghion Casino, order lobster or salmon
at the Jacaranda restaurant, play tennis or swim at the Hilton
Hotel, get together in a steady round of cocktail parties and spend
weekends at lakeside resorts a few hours' drive away.
   For most expatriates, and Ethiopians with hard currency, all
roads lead to the state-owned Victory Store, a fantasyland of
luxuries on the outskirts, far from the pickpockets, beggars,
urchins and hawkers who hound shoppers in downtown Addis Ababa.
   It's open to anyone with who has dollars in this one-party
state, whose leaders preached Marxism until recently.
   Other state stores are short of basics like sugar, cooking oil
and rice. The Victory has French cheeses, Italian wines, Danish
hams, Tunisian sardines, American cookies and ketchup, Australian
canned fruits and vegetables, and Belgian pates.
   It also stocks French perfumes, Spanish shoes, Japanese
television sets and video recorders and British refrigerators and
stoves.
   Shoppers can relax over coffee or a beer in the Victory's own
Red Lion Pub while their bills are totaled, or scan the bulletin
board for what departing diplomats and others have to offer, from
cars or compact disc players for sale to houses for rent.
   ``Foreigners often spend more here in a day than we get in a
year,'' said an Ethiopian clerk at the Victory, who earns the
equivalent of about $60 a month. ``It's difficult to keep a smile
when we're serving them.''
   A jewel-bedecked woman led four loaded carts out of the store _
a month's groceries worth more than $900. She tipped the Ethiopians
who pushed the carts $1 each.

<TEXT>
   There are no violins or bright
costumes in this ragtag Gypsy settlement 30 miles from Budapest,
just the memory of centuries of oppression and a skeptical view of
the future.
   Four decades of communism did little to temper the bitter
history of Gypsies in Eastern Europe, and the coming of democracy
is not enough to inspire trust within the dirt-floored shacks of
Kerepestarcsa.
   Most inhabitants wear dirty hand-me-downs. A 30-year-old looks
50 and few of the children wear shoes. No one is sure how many
people live here.
   ``The average traveler thinks, `Here's a Gypsy; he's happy, well
fed and plays wonderful music,' but that is only 1 percent of the
Gypsy population,'' said Bela Osztoikan, head of the Gypsy
organization Phralipe, or Brotherhood.
   ``In reality, most of them live in poverty, and where there is
poverty, there is no culture. There is more crime and there is
darkness.''
   Leaders of Eastern Europe's 6 million Gypsies have no praise for
the former Communist regimes, which were guilty of forced
assimilation, exploitation and discrimination, and little faith in
a democratic future.
   ``Most Gypsies are afraid of change,'' which takes them ``toward
the unknown,'' said Manush Romanov of Bulgaria's Democratic Union
of Roma. One of the two main Gypsy branches calls itself Roma, and
the other is Sinti.
   However deep their distrust, the new freedom allows Gypsies to
voice their frustrations openly for the first time in decades.
   ``The Communist Hungarian leaders of the past 45 years stripped
the Gypsies of their own communities, forbade them to practice the
trades of their ancestors, spoke disparagingly of their language
and culture,'' Gypsy author Jozsef Choli Daroczi said recently.
   In Hungary and elsewhere, the Communists preached equality in an
attempt to paper over centuries of prejudice that culminated in the
extermination of an estimated 500,000 European Gypsies by the Nazis.
   The hatreds did not die. Prominent in the Budapest graffiti of
the 1980s was ``OAC'' _ for Oeld a Ciganyt, which means Kill the
Gypsy.
   A 1983 song by the Hungarian rock group Mosoly contains the vow
to ``exterminate all Gypsies, adults and children.''
   Officials also did their part. In Czechoslovakia, Jozef Prokop
of the government Commission for the Problems of the Gypsy
Populance said a few years ago that 20 percent of Gypsy newborns
were mentally retarded.
   He expressed horror at a birth rate of 7,000 a year in an
estimated Gypsy population of 600,000 and advocated enforced birth
control. Prokop also recommended ``alternative methods'' of raising
Gypsy children, ``for example, in foster homes, special boarding
schools and the like.''
   Gypsies say Bulgaria responded to a perceived danger of Gypsy
overpopulation with a 30-year assimilation campaign that began in
the 1950s and included forced name changes.
   ``By the 1960s at the latest, everything had been forbidden that
had anything to do with Gypsyhood,'' Romanov said. He described
attempts to destroy Gypsy traditions and language as ``cultural and
ethnic genocide.''
   Less forced assimilation occurred in Poland and Romania, but
Gypsies there were pressured into giving up traditional ways in the
name of equality.
   Despite their numbers _ an estimated 3 million in Romania alone
_ Gypsies became an ethnic nonentity and others made the decisions
relating to them.
   What special status they were given was negative. In Hungary,
television programs dealing with crime showed photographs of
juvenile offenders only if they were Gypsies.
   After trying to erase the old traditions, Communist authorities
across East Europe offered no real way for Gypsies to integrate,
and left them generally with poor schooling, substandard housing
and little medical care.
   Such neglect produced an army of Gypsy school dropouts that
became a source of cheap, unskilled labor for state-owned
enterprises.
   Gypsies now stand to suffer most from the double squeeze of
companies closing or laying off thousands of employees and
cost-conscious governments cutting back on social programs.
   In a capitalist system, there will be ``no further need for the
great masses of the Gypsy people'' qualified only for menial tasks,
Phralipe said in its founding declaration last year. ``They will be
. . . pushed to the edge of society.''
   Beggars and black marketeers have reappeared in European
capitals. Many are Gypsies.
   East Europeans share the perception that much of the increase in
crime is attributable to Gypsies.
   Such developments have given new life to old beliefs that
Gypsies are thieves and loafers.
   ``They are all accusing us . . . of murderous crimes,'' said a
30-year-old Gypsy from Giurgiu in southern Romania.
   Anti-Gypsy feeling has led to violence unthinkable under
Communist regimes, where rowdies had more fear of police. In
Prague, Czechoslovakia, roving bands of skinheads have attacked
Gypsies.
   ``We've had so many promises that we're tired of them,'' said
Ilona Bango, 30, joining companions in reciting a long list of
wrongs. ``Let action replace words.''

<HEAD>With BC-Ellis Renovations, b0783</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The huddled masses, it turns out, weren't
particularly tired or poor or ``tempest-tost''; they were the
wretched refuse of nobody's shore. And instead of dissolving into a
melting pot, they formed a lumpy stew of Old World languages, foods
and customs.
   Such are the lessons of the Ellis Island Immigration Museum,
which opens to the public Monday on the island through which 12
million immigrants passed between 1892 and 1954.
   The new museum, housed in the renovated Victorian immigration
station building, is dedicated to refuting and rewriting a variety
of persistent myths about immigration in general and the island in
particular.
   Visitors might be surprised to learn:
   _ The only people who were given new names on Ellis Island were
the young women who got married there.
   _ A greater proportion of would-be immigrants were barred from
America at European ports, about 5 percent, than at Ellis, 2
percent.
   _ Most who passed through Ellis ferried on to New Jersey, the
gateway to the rest of America, not New York City.
   _ Although 30 million people came to America in this century, 10
million moved out.
   The myth the museum most thoroughly deconstructs is that of the
uprooted immigrant, a pathetic, ragged creature blindly fleeing
tyranny, plague or famine.
   ``These were not destitute people,'' said Diana Pardue,
supervisor of curators. ``The really poor did not come over. They
couldn't afford the passage, or they didn't have the $25 you needed
to clear immigration here.''
   Most of those who did come, she added, ``were middle- or
lower-middle class. They were looking for a better lifestyle, or a
chance to be educated, or to buy land.''
   They had tasted freedom and prosperity in Europe, wanted more,
and so set out for the world's emerging agricultural and industrial
power.
   ``I don't think the myth of misery and degradation helps at
all,'' Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan has written. ``In particular,
it doesn't help explain the strengthening of American democracy in
the age of immigration.''
   The museum helps refurbish the immigrants' image by displaying
their middle-class trappings: a teddy bear carried by a girl from
Switzerland, an early German box camera, a silver pocket watch from
France.
   Oral histories fill in the picture. The mother of Michael
Dukakis, for instance, recalls coming here not because of hunger or
war but because women in her native Greece could not go to college.
   If the immigrants were not so wretched, neither were the
conditions under which most of them traveled. Pardue admits that
steerage, the least expensive steamship passenger class, could be
unpleasant. But she likens it to ``tourist class on an airline
today. (Immigrants) paid a rate like the super-saver fare.''
   The museum also stresses the immigrants' attempts to retain,
rather than reject, their ethnic identity.
   ``The old theory is the melting pot, where immigrants were
immediately assimilated,'' said Pardue. ``Now we believe that the
immigrants pretty much maintained their ethnicity and settled in
groups of their own.''
   Although Ellis welcomed its share of the famous _ Irving Berlin
and Bob Hope passed through in their early years _ the new museum
emphasizes the experience of ordinary people.
   Unlike the immigration museum in the base of the Statue of
Liberty, which stresses the contributions of rich men like Andrew
Carnegie and Joseph Pulitzer, ``there are no famous immigrants in
this museum,'' said Phyllis Montgomery, a staffer at a firm that
helped create the exhibits.
   The museum also will dispel one particularly durable legend:
that Ellis immigration clerks shortened and otherwise
``Americanized'' unwieldy European names.
   National Park Service researchers encountered only one immigrant
who claimed to have been renamed at Ellis, and she could provide no
documentation.
   What's more, ``there was no legal way names could have been
changed here,'' said Pardue. ``Even if a clerk mispronounced
someone's name, it was never written down.''
   Some immigrants' names were changed involuntarily, but probably
by other culprits. Suspects include steamship company clerks in
Europe, who compiled the passenger lists on which Ellis immigration
officials relied.
   ``To a clerk in (the German port of) Bremen, some Polish names
might be incomprehensible,'' said Gary Roth, an exhibit designer.
   Some changed their names by taking marriage vows. The
immigration service would not allow unescorted single young women,
including mail-order brides, to leave the island, so the knot was
tied in the island's chapel.
   In many cases, historians believe, newcomers simply changed
their own names to better fit in with their new surroundings.
   Finally, the museum aims to give Ellis Island itself a new
image. According to Pardue, the ``Isle of Tears'' wasn't so sad:
``Most people think it was a drab, awful place, but it wasn't all
doom and gloom.''
   The island was breezy in summer, and commanded a fine view of
lower Manhattan and New York Harbor. It had playgrounds for
children, who years later still recalled the man with the cart who
handed out milk and cookies.
   The few immigrants who were detained enjoyed three meals a day,
gardens, tennis courts and concerts (one said she heard Caruso sing
there). Some got their first look at an electric light, others
their first taste of white bread.
   ``Many people were in awe of the place,'' said Pardue. ``In some
ways, it was a sort of mini-resort.''

   Thirty years ago, the joke
circulating MGM studio went like this:
   ``Too bad about Ann Miller.''
   ``Why? What happened to her?''
   ``She fell down and broke her hair.''
   The sophisticates used to deride Miller, with her laquered hair,
powdered face and sunshiny verve. But most of her detractors are
dead or at the Motion Picture Country House, and Miller goes on.
The gams are great, and the toes can still tap a mile a minute.
   She remains a Hollywood landmark at age _ well, it's best to let
her tell it.
   ``My story is kind of weird,'' she says. ``I was discovered
dancing up at Bal Tabarin, a theater-restaurant in San Francisco,
when I was not quite 13 years old. I was very tall, and I had
eyelashes and long fingernails, the whole thing. Lucille Ball and
(vaudeville and radio comic) Benny Rubin saw me dancing one night.
That was when Eleanor Powell was at her height.
   ``RKO was looking for another dancer, and Lucy and Benny saw me
doing this little machine-gun tap thing. They asked me if I'd like
to take a test at RKO. Of course, my mother and I just jumped at
the chance. They asked me how old I was, and I said 18. television and
on
Broadway in ``Mame.'' She teamed with Mickey Rooney in a hokey
revue, ``Sugar Babies,'' that lasted 8{ years in New York, on the
road and London. It made both stars rich.
   `` `Sugar Babies' brought me the financial freedom that I
needed,'' Miller reflected, ``and it brought me the stardom that I
needed. At MGM I always played the second feminine lead; I was
never the star in films. I was the brassy, good-hearted showgirl. I
never really had my big moment on the screen.
   ` ``Sugar Babies' and `Mame' gave me the stardom that my soul
kind of yearned for.''

<TEXT>
   When director Fritz Lang fled Nazi Germany in
1933, he gazed out the dining car of his train and brushed the hair
out of his eyes, the wind sweeping across his face. He then watched
the tracks join together, split in two and join together again.
   At least, that's how Howard Rodman imagines it. He also imagines
a meeting between Lang and Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels.
They're sitting in Goebbels' office, parallelograms of light
shining on a dusty parquet floor. As the propaganda minster speaks,
Lang stares at a large municipal clock outside, a ray of sunlight
inching towards his shoe.
   ``Destiny Express'' ($17.95, Atheneum) is Rodman's first
published novel, the writing clean and well-lighted. It was
inspired, appropriately, by one of Lang's movies, during an
afternoon in 1982 when Rodman took time off from his job as a union
organizer in Manhattan and sat through the director's classic
thriller, ``The Testament of Dr. Mabuse.''
   Rodman, who always loved film noir of the 1940s and '50s, said
the Lang film was one of those movies that changes your life.
   ``Part of it was realizing how much of contemporary films, from
`Star Wars' stuff to `Indiana Jones' come right out of this
particular film,'' he said. ``Part of it was the joy of watching
somebody inventing the language of filmmaking right before your
eyes. How you tell a story through shots and narratives was
something that he along with other people devised, and I watched
that happening.''
   Lang was one of Germany's most celebrated directors until the
Nazis came to power and, Rodman, who had completed a novel about
``sex, drugs and politics'' in New York, tracked down his other
films (``Metropolis'' and ``M'' among them). He also read books and
contemporary reviews.
   Rodman considered an essay about Lang's films, but instead was
drawn to dramatizing the director, especially the artistic
collaboration with his wife, Thea von Harbou, who remained in
Germany and eventually became a Nazi.
   `It's pretty clear that their partnership was equal,'' said
Rodman, who has written for the magazines Premiere and American
Film. ``But the real kicker was how they each thought of those
films.
   ``He looked back at all the films he made prior to leaving
Germany as the films that, of course, were the films that someone
when confronted with Nazism would have to be repelled by it, would
have to escape it, would leave behind your career, your language,
everything.
   ``She saw the exact same films as the absolute natural
precursors of what the Nazi party was doing. She saw `Metropolis'
as leading everything, inevitably and joyfully, to the ascension to
power of Hitler. I wanted to know how two people could be so
incredibly intimate as collaborators and yet have widely different
world views.''
   ``Destiny Express,'' named after Lang's 1921 film, ``Destiny,''
takes place during the director's last days in Germany. Thea is
having an affair with an American surrealist. Fellow artists
Bertolt Brecht, Billy Wilder and Max Ophuls are leaving the
country, and Goebbels has offered Lang the chance to make
propaganda films.
   This is Rodman's equivalent to motivational light, a novel so
visual that shadows seem to streak across the page and the words
stand out like individual frames.
   ``Alone in the corrider he scraped a wood match against the
wall, lighting a cigarette ...,'' Rodman writes.
   ``Lang's feet, like his hands, were quite large and he walked
with an erect military carriage. He had been out here for most of
the film, extinguishing coarse imported cigarettes on the floor,
and watching the play of his distinctly multiple shadows. The
shadows elongated and foreshortened as he paced the hallway . . .
Lang adjusted his monocle and idly lit one more match.''
   ``I didn't know what the characters' faces would look like or
what they were going to say unless I knew what the light was in the
room,'' Rodman said. ``I'm not in real life usually a glum sort of
custard, but I wanted that sense of the world closing in.
   ``I think it is true that what Lang is thinking is a world in
which the camera, the car, the airplane ... all are used for
purposes for genocide and not longer after the events of this
book.''
   Adapting ``Destiny Express'' to film seemed obvious and Rodman's
agent is working on a deal in which the movie would be shot in
Europe using English-speaking actors. All Rodman had to do was
prepare a treatment, a process painful enough to give him
nightmares about parallelograms of light.
   ``It was the hardest thing I ever had to write,'' he said. ``I
had to turn the book inside out in order to do it, find some
external equivalent for every literary thing in this book. The
writing was deceptively cinematic. You had to reinvent it from the
details. I did it but I never will again.''

Integrity</HEAD>

   Country music singer Holly Dunn offers
these reasons why she recently had nine straight Top 10 hits: ``It
was a miracle. Divine guidance.''
   It was the kind of explanation you'd expect to hear from the
daughter of a minister. Dun also has less heavenly ideas why her
music is played so often on the nation's 2,100 country music radio
stations.
   ``I hope it's because our music is good and has integrity,'' she
said. ``We don't put something out just to be putting it out. We
labor over the writing, the producing and the singing.''
   Dunn's versatility, hard work and clean living have made her one
of country music's steadiest and most popular performers during the
past four years.
   Her poignant 1986 hit, ``Daddy's Hands,'' is destined to become
a country music classic. Since then, she has won the Country Music
Association's Horizon Award as the most promising newcomer. And she
has affirmed that honor with No. 1 country hits such as ``Are You
Ever Gonna Love Me,'' ``Only When I Love'' and ``Love Someone Like
Me.''
   She teamed with Michael Martin Murphey on the duet ``A Face in
the Crowd,'' which earned them a Grammy nomination. She also
recorded the duet ``Maybe'' with Kenny Rogers and has sung on
albums with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris.
   Last October, she became the 64th regular cast member of the
Grand Ole Opry.
   Dunn, 33, was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas. She has
created her niche like many other country stars: singing about love
and family. But she offers much more.
   ``I'm a little unique in a lot of ways,'' she said during an
interview in her publicist's Music Row office.
   ``I'm the only one, as far as I know on the female side, who
writes, produces and sings the material. I think this gives me a
real legitimacy, a genuineness. I'm not just up there standing
where they tell me to stand, singing what they tell me to sing.
   ``I `feel' what I do. I think there's a sensitivity in a lot of
my music, a lot of me in there. I think people appreciate that.
This is what I try for, anyway.''
   She wrote ``Daddy's Hands,'' a touching tune about a child's
memories of her father, as a Father's Day gift to her dad, a Church
of Christ minister in San Antonio. It found its way onto record and
into country music lore.
   ``It's become one of the most requested songs in country music
of all time,'' Dunn said. ``It's right up there with `Forever and
Ever, Amen' and all those standards.''
   Some people believe it may follow the pattern of ``Wind Beneath
My Wings,'' which was a country hit by Gary Morris and crossed over
to the pop charts years later to become a hit for Bette Midler.
   Dunn isn't sure.
   ``It's so country _ the melody, the feel, all of it. I don't
know how anybody would change that, but it would be fine with me if
they want to try,'' she said.
   ``What really surprised me is someone hasn't picked it up for a
greeting card commercial or something. I've had it pitched to
several companies, because it's such a natural. It would be a
perfect Father's Day ad.''
   ``Daddy's Hands,'' her best known record, came early in her
career.
   ``I guess it's kind of strange to have it happen so quickly,''
Dunn said. ``In a way, it created sort of a false energy. We had to
level off somewhere, and now we've kicked back in. We had such a
big surge because of that one song.''
   She has been in Nashville since graduation from Abilene
Christian University. In the country music capital, she worked as a
clerk in a bookstore and then as a travel agent before becoming a
full-time performer.
   She worked as a staff songwriter for four years before signing
with MTM Records to pursue a singing career. When MTM folded, she
quickly signed with Warner Bros.
   Along the way, she sang ``Most of All, Why'' with Parton. Harris
was guest vocalist on Dunn's ``Cornerstone'' LP. Then there was
work with Rogers, whom she describes as one of the nicest people in
music.
   ``He thanked me for helping his career, and I'm sure I didn't.
That's the kind of person he is _ very generous,'' she said. ``I
also got to work the road with him some, and that fulfilled some
fantasies of mine.''

   Four teen-agers who attended the first
Bolshoi Academy dance school at Colorado Mountain College have been
invited to study at the prestigious academy's facilities in Moscow.
   Sophia Golovkina, artistic director of the academy, extended the
invitations last weekend to Stacey Uster, 13, of Wheat Ridge; Jesse
Roderick, 14, Arvada; Tammy Gargas, 11, Tabernacle, N.J.; and Kara
Jehle, 12, Pensacola, Fla.
   The four were among 44 students between 11 and 18 years who
spent a month studying with Bolshoi Academy instructors Alexandr
``Sasha'' Bondarenko and Galina Solovyeva. The Soviets set up the
school _ the first in North America _ after making a stop in Vail
during a U.S. tour last year. They also operate a satellite school
in Japan.
   The four would-be ballerinas have been asked to spend six months
at the Moscow school early next year, with the average cost
expected to run about $1,500 a month, officials said. The financing
details haven't been set yet.

   Anyone who has seen pictures of military
equipment assembled in the Mideast or who observes the millions of
automobiles on U.S. roads knows immediately that America can still
manufacture.
   Despite this visual evidence, stories abound about the decline
of American manufacturing, about the abandonment of still another
plant, about the so-called de-industrialization of the nation.
   ``Modern mythology,'' snaps Murrary Weidenbaum. American
manufacturing not only is well, he says, but has improved in
several ways that bode well for the future.
   He observes that the decline that led to a rash of doomsday
books, articles and extremist forecasts, ended nearly a decade ago.
As often happens, however, the belief lingers, erroneous though it
might be. There is, some say, a vested interest in the myth:
research, books, consultancies, academic grants.
   But, says Weidenbaum, ``The manufacturing sector today
contributes just about the same proportion of the total output of
the American economy as it did three decades ago.'' And in that
period the economy grew more than four times.
   Weidenbaum has a longtime involvement with issues of industrial
myth vs. fact, having been chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers in the Reagan administration, and since then as director
of the Center for the Study of American Business, a think tank
based at Washington University in St. Louis.
   Contrary to the doom-and-gloomers, he says, the longest U.S.
peacetime expansion didn't bypass the industrial sector. By
year-end 1988, he points out, industrial production was 40 percent
above the 1982 low. Perhaps of even greater importance, that rate
was 24 percent above the previous cyclical high.
   Now, he states, three key forces are at work which strongly
suggest the industrial sector will continue strong in the 1990s:
   _ American companies have been reducing the cost of producing
goods and services.
   In 1980, the average private-sector worker received a 9 percent
wage boost. By mid-1989, the rate was half that. For all 1988, the
number of work stoppages involving 1,000 or more employees was 43,
compared to 300 a decade earlier.
   _ Workers and managers are showing a new awareness of their
personal responsibility for quality.
   At some manufacturers, Weidenbaum states, employees receive as
much as 40 hours of training in quality measurements. And
responsibility for quality control is gradually moving from
inspectors to workers themselves.
   _ Private investment in research and development continues to
grow.
   For the first time since data was assembled, business R&amp;D
outlays in the 1980s exceeded government spending, by $445 billion
to $430 billion. The number of R&amp;D scientists and engineers grew to
595,000 in 1987 from 469,000 in 1980.
   These three factors have made a difference and will continue to
do so, says Weidenbaum.
   From 1973 to 1981, he points out, domestic manufacturers
increased productivity by only 1.5 percent a year, but from 1981 to
1988 the average more than doubled to 3.8 percent, higher even than
in the period 1948-1973.
   In short, says Weidenbaum, the American manufacturing sector is
stronger today than it was a decade or so ago, in spite of the
persistent declaration by public officials, academics and others
that it is in decline.
   Weidenbaum believes American competetiveness will continue
strong, assuming the country doesn't adopt counterproductive public
policies.
   Protectionism would be one such policy. A spate of social
mandates _ higher minimum wages, compulsory health insurance,
parental leave _ that raise the cost of doing business would be
another.
   In contrast, he says, a reduction of federal budget deficits
through spending cuts, especially if the cuts focus on consumption,
could lead to additional improvements in the manufacturing sector.
   He concludes: ``Enhancing the competitiveness of American
industry is not fundamentally a question of how to get government
to do more for manufacturing, but how to get it to do less to
manufacturing.''

<HEAD>Nordstrom's Northeast Debut Comes at Tough Time in Retailing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As the trademark piano received a final
tuning, sales help scurried around the new Nordstrom Inc.
department store unpacking the remaining boxes, rearranging clothes
racks and getting to know the inventory.
   The opening of the Nordstrom store at the Garden State Plaza
shopping mall in Paramus, N.J., marks the retailer's first foray
into the fiercely competitive Northeast.
   The official debut occurs Friday when the 245,000-square-foot
store opens for business. Members of the media were given a preview
tour of the store Tuesday.
   Operating in this area might pose the biggest challenge yet for
the West Coast chain that has been migrating eastward as part of an
ambitious expansion.
   A struggling regional economy has shaken consumer confidence and
crimped spending. Crisis in the Middle East could further curb
retail spending as the critical holiday season approaches.
   Nonetheless, Nordstrom executives seem optimistic about entering
the market and private analysts say the retailer stands a good
chance to thrive here.
   Its service-oriented brand of retailing, combined with broad
assortments of reliable quality merchandise, will give it an edge
over rivals with less favorable reputations, analysts say.
   ``I think it's probably one of the best _ if not the best _
department stores in the country,'' said Carl Steidtmann, chief
economist at Management Horizons, the retail management and market
research division of the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. ``The
fact that the competition is in such a state of disarray might make
it a good time to go into the Northeast.''
   Richard Pyle, a retail analyst at Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc.,
said Nordstrom, which focuses on women's, men's and children's
fashions, shoes and accessories, is in far better financial shape
than its competitors.
   Some department stores, such as Macy's _ which is a Nordstrom
neighbor at the Garden State Plaza _ are courting customers
aggressively to boost business and pay off debts. Others, such as
Saks Fith Avenue, are adjusting to life under new owners who are
closely monitoring bottom lines.
   The 61-store Nordstrom chain dates back to 1901 when Swedish
immigrant John W. Nordstrom founded a Seattle shoe shop with money
made mining gold in Alaska. Nordstrom still emphasizes shoes; the
Paramus store boasts an inventory of some 70,000 ladies' shoes and
30,000 men's.
   The chain has historically prided itself on top-notch service
and stories abound about its sales associates going to unusual
lengths to please people. ``Nordies'' have been known to personally
deliver merchandise to customers' homes and to write thank-you
notes to customers _ typically on their own time.
   The legendary service has been a key to landing customers in new
markets.
   As elsewhere, the Paramus store employs personal shoppers who
will help customers select apparel, assemble outfits and
accessorize. A concierge stationed near the entrance will steer
customers in the right direction and handle special requests.
Shoppers have three restaurants to choose from on the store's three
levels and a spa offering massages, facials, manicures, pedicures
and waxing.
   James F. Nordstrom, one of three descendents of the founder who
currently bear the title co-chairman, said shoppers appreciate
being treated well no matter what part of the country they live in.
Apart from minor adjustments in merchandise mix, he said there have
been no special adaptations made in bringing the Seattle-based
retailer east.
   The chain already operates two stores in the Virginia suburbs of
Washington and intends to open two more in New Jersey over the next
two years, plus one in New York in 1993. Its growth strategy calls
for about four openings a year.
   ``We just think customers like a lot of selection, good quality
and to be treated nicely,'' he said in a telephone interview from
the company's headquarters.
   One blot on the Nordstrom name appeared earlier this year when
the Washington state Department of Labor and Industries, acting
after a union complaint, ruled that the company has failed to pay
employees for some of the extras they provide. The agency ordered
Nordstrom to properly compensate employees for work and to pay back
wages.
   Industry analysts say Nordstrom has weathered the bad publicity
without much damage to its reputation. A $15 million reserve the
company set aside to pay back wage claims should be adequate.
   James Nordstrom said the labor problems, which have been
confined mostly to the Seattle area, haven't impaired the
retailer's results.
   Many employees have proven their commitment to the company, he
said, by paying their own way to transfer to new stores. The
Paramus store will have about 100 sales associates who have
previously worked elsewhere for Nordstrom. An additional 100
managers were transferred by the company, which has a policy of
promoting from within. About 900 employees overall will work at the
Garden State Plaza store.
   Nordstrom's sales and profits haven't been as impressive lately
as they had been in the recent past. Earnings slid 20 percent in
the first half of this year to $49 million on sales of $1.36
billion. That deterioration came after a 7 percent income drop last
year to $115 million despite a 14.7 percent sales gain to $2.7
billion.
   Nordstrom also has felt the pinch of the currently sluggish
retail climate. Co-chairman Nordstrom said, ``It's fair to say that
our planned increase in sales is greater than the increase we're
experiencing.''
   He said the retailer is taking a conservative approach to the
coming season and will tighten inventory slightly.
   If business doesn't measure up chainwide for a prolonged period,
Nordstrom may scale back its expansion plans. ``We're not going to
leverage ourselves and grow for growth sake,'' Nordstrom said,
noting that some openings may be delayed if necessary.
   At the Paramus store, retail analysts say the company is hoping
sales will exceed $100 million in the first year. Nordstrom
executives declined to disclose projections.

<TEXT>
   This western Wisconsin community _ in
many ways the center of the dairy industry _ is the first
battleground over proposed changes in the government's decades-old
milk pricing system.
   It hosts the first hearing today in a rare U.S. Department of
Agriculture investigation into whether the federal milk marketing
system should be altered to eliminate price disparities from one
region to another.
   The formula partially pays farmers based on how far they live
from Eau Claire, a city of about 50,000 located 120 miles east of
Minneapolis in the heart of Wisconsin's dairy farm region.
   Dairy farmers close to Eau Claire argue the milk-pricing system
is unfair, outdated and provides artificially high subsidies for
producers in the South and West who live farthest from here.
   The milk marketing order system, created in the 1930s, is
designed to insure an adequate supply of milk, move milk from
high-production areas and stabilize the market, said Bob Cropp, a
dairy marketing specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
   But while milk production in the South and West _ traditionally
non-dairy producing states that have received higher prices for
their milk _ has increased markedly, the current system continues
to pay farmers in those regions more than the Midwest, Cropp said.
   ``I don't mind competing against farmers from the South and West
as long as we are competing by the same rules,'' said Wisconsin
dairy farmer Pete Knigge, the chairman of the National Commission
on Agriculture and Rural Development Policy.
   Officials expect the hearings to manifest the strong regional
splits over the issue.
   ``Certainly, there is a great divergence of opinion among
producers in various parts of the country on changes needed in the
order program,'' said Jim Barr, chief executive officer of the
National Milk Producers Federation in Virginia.
   The Federation represents about 100,000 dairy farmers who
produce 70 percent of the nation's milk, Barr said. The group's
membership is about evenly split over whether the current system
should be changed, he said.
   An administrative law judge will conduct the Agriculture
Department hearings, which will explore about 60 different
proposals to alter the system, U.S. Rep. Steven Gunderson, R-Wis.,
said.
   The administrative law judge will make recommendations to U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who observers predict will
take two to three years to institute changes.
   Three days of testimony are planned in Eau Claire. The remaining
hearings will be Sept. 10-19 in Minneapolis; Sept. 20 in St. Cloud,
Minn.; Oct. 1-5 in Syracuse, N.Y.; Oct. 10-12 in Tallahassee, Fla.,
and Oct. 15 in Dallas.
   The present system includes a transportation factor in
determining what farmers are paid for milk. The farther a farmer
lives from Eau Claire, the more the producer receives.
   While Wisconsin remains the No. 1 milk producing state with
about 17.5 percent of the nation's milk supply _ a title it has
held for the last century _ California has moved into second place
with a 13-percent share of the market.
   Eau Claire became the measuring spot for the transportation
differential in 1961 because the bulk of U.S. was produced in
Wisconsin and Minnesota, and Eau Claire was center of that
production.
   ``When you look at the kind of increases in production in the
South and West, there simply is no rhyme or reason for providing
incentives based on how far you live away from Eau Claire,''
Gunderson said.
   For example, in June, a Wisconsin dairy farmer, on the average,
earned $14.20 for every eight gallons of milk he produced, based on
the federal milk orders, Barr said.
   The same farmer in Florida got $17.30.

<HEAD>Stock Exchange Seat Price at Lowest Since December 1984</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's getting a little easier to get into one of
business's more exclusive clubs.
   Two New York Stock Exchange seats in the past two months have
each sold for $301,000 each, the lowest level in more than 5{ years.
   Prices of seats _ which entitle members to trade directly on the
stock exchange floor _ tend to reflect the level of trading volume
on the NYSE, the nation's largest stock exchange.
   The latest sale, on Tuesday, matched the price paid on Aug. 23,
continues a decline that has driven down prices from the all-time
high of $1.15 million in September 1987, a month before the stock
market crashed.
   A seat last sold for $300,000 on Dec. 17, 1984.
   Brokerage firms in the last year have reduced personnel and
operations, individual investors have shied away from stocks and
commission rates have fallen _ reducing the desirability of owning
a seat. Less trading means lower commissions and less revenue for
brokerage firms.
   The price of an NYSE membership has fallen steadily since the
1987 market crash after a steady rise that took seats from a low of
$35,000 in 1977 to $105,000 in 1978, $425,000 in 1983 and $600,000
in 1986.
   The high seat price this year was $430,000 on June 7, according
to stock exchange records. There have been 24 seat sales so far in
1990 _ including seven in August _ compared with 26 in all of 1989.
   The most recent seat sales have been $370,000 on July 17,
$330,000 on Aug. 3, $325,000 on Aug. 14, $320,000 on Aug. 15,
$310,000 on Aug. 20, $301,000 on Aug. 23, $309,000 on Aug. 28 and
$305,000 on Aug. 31.
   Following the latest sale, the quoted price for a seat was
$350,000 with a bid of $280,000. The quoted price is the asking
price and the bid is what a buyer is willing to pay.
   Seat prices also have fallen at the American Stock Exchange to
10-year lows, but the sharp rise in oil prices since Iraq seized
Kuwait last month has driven up seats on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, where oil futures are traded.
   The seat system dates to 1868, when stock exchange membership
was made saleable. Before that, each member had a lifetime seat
reserved in one place.
   Physically, there haven't been seats on the floor for years, and
the name dates to a time when brokers literally sat around trading
a roster of stocks. The number of seats has been limited to 1,366
since 1953.

<HEAD>Moody's: Real Estate Loans Continue To Threaten Banks</HEAD>

   Troubled loans for real estate and leveraged
buyouts are adding to the burdens of the nation's biggest banks,
Moody's Investors Service Inc. said.
   The problems are hindering the banks' recoveries from past
mistakes in lending to developing nations, the credit rating agency
said.
   In a pessimistic annual review, Moody's said Tuesday the 1990s
may be the decade in which some powerful regional institutions
challenge the supremacy of the nationwide ``money-center'' banks.
   While the creditworthiness of most of the nine money-center
banks has steadily declined since the 1970s, problems have
accelerated in recent years with credit rating reductions.
   Moody's said in a 37-page report that major trouble spots for
banks are $55 billion in commercial real estate loans, inadequate
reserves to cover nonperforming loans to developing countries and a
large exposure to buyouts and other high-risk transactions.
   The nine money center banks are BankAmerica Corp., Bankers Trust
New York Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Chemical Bank Corp.,
Citicorp, Continental Bank Corp., First Chicago Corp.,
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.
   The report said that all the money centers except J.P. Morgan
and Bankers Trust are undercapitalized because of ``the sharp
deterioration in domestic asset quality and low domestic reserves.''
   Moody's said it was not clear the banks could rebuild capital
quickly enough to absorb additional provisions against domestic and
developing country loans, which might be required.
   The report mentioned Security Pacific Corp. of Los Angeles,
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. of San Francisco, NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.,
and Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, as key ``superregionals'' for
the 1990s.
   The most recent round of credit-rating downgrades affecting
Citicorp and other giants were prompted by the real estate slump,
and Moody's offered no promises that further downgrades could be
avoided.
   Moody's said vacancy rates remain high in big cities, which
appear to be overbuilt, and that construction loans of all types
are ``potentially troublesome, particularly for hotels and strip
shopping centers.''
   Market psychology has deteriorated, as the savings and loan
scandal has forced many regional and money-center banks to reduce
new real estate lending. That has put developers under pressure and
made existing properties tough to sell, Moody's said.
   The credit agency listed Texas, Arizona, New England, Oklahoma,
Tennessee and Colorado as ``highly distressed'' markets. It said
``significant risk elements'' exist in New Jersey, Georgia,
Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, California, New York and Florida.
   Chemical Bank had the largest percentage of nonperforming
commercial real estate loans _ on which no interest is being paid _
at 15.5 percent, followed by Citicorp at 13.9 percent and First
Chicago at 12.6 percent. J.P. Morgan had by far the lowest rate,
0.4 percent.
   Overall, 11.4 percent of the banks' $54.9 billion in commercial
real estate loans outstanding in March were described as
nonperforming, the report said.
   Moody's also said banks' still need to increase their reserves
to account for a larger slice of outstanding loans to Latin
American countries.
   Moody's said average coverage by banks increased to 50 percent
in the first quarter of 1990 from 37 percent in 1988, but the level
remains below the 75 percent to 100 percent established by most
regional and international banks.
   Further clouding the future of national banks is exposure to
high-risk transactions, mostly leveraged buyouts initiated in the
mid to late 1980s. In a leveraged buyout, an investor or investors
borrow a large amount of money to purchase a corporation and then
sell assets to make interest payments.
   Moody's said the nation's money-center banks had $54 billion in
exposure to highly leveraged transaction at the end of 1989, up
from $32 billion in 1988, in part because of a broader regulatory
definition.
   But the report pegged ``HLT'' exposure as a major coming problem
area, with nonperforming assets expected to rise substantially.
Compounding the problems is the collapse of the junk bond market,
which was envisioned as a place to refinance some leveraged buyouts.
   ``Problem borrowers may go bankrupt, resulting in a lengthy
workout process before the banks can recover their principal,''
Moody's said.
   ``In several instances, asset sales have fetched prices below
expectations,'' the report said. ``As a consequence, those LBO
structures that rely upon asset sales or refinancing to meet
maturing principal . . . may encounter difficulty in the next few
years.''

<HEAD>IMF Study of Soviet Economy to be on Helsinki Agenda</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wire.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund, which has
prescribed financial austerity and free-market capitalism for
countries from Mexico to Mozambique, may be about to issue the same
prescription to the capital of world communism.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that an
IMF-led study of the Soviet economy will be on the agenda when
President Bush meets with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in
Helsinki, Finland, on Sunday.
   Industrialized nations meeting at the economic summit in Houston
in July ordered the IMF and three other international financial
institutions to study the Soviet Union's needs and the
opportunities for western help.
   ``President Bush will be interested in the progress that has
been made in that assessment, and President Gorbachev's views of
the reform effort,'' Fitzwater said.
   The IMF, founded in a New Hampshire village 46 years ago to
stabilize the exchange of money among nations, is coordinating the
study. Also taking part are the Washington-based World Bank, which
makes loans for projects in Third World countries; the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; and the
newly formed European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
   Graham Newman, deputy chief of the IMF information office, said
a team representing the four organizations has been in the Soviet
Union conducting interviews and collecting data for the study,
which is due to be completed by the end of the year.
   Newman said the IMF will not have a representative in Helsinki,
but it ``could well be'' that the team will submit to the president
a memo on its progress.
   Of the four agencies, the IMF is perhaps the most controversial,
partly because of policies that its critics say have imposed
stringent economic rules on developing nations to the detriment of
the poor.
   ``The standard prescription for countries suffering from
inflation to get an IMF loan is dismissal of workers from public
employment, deflation of the currency and removal of subsidies on
basic staples,'' said Laurence Birns, president of the Council on
Hemispheric Affairs. ``There is no question that the group that
bears the heaviest burden in these restructuring efforts are the
poor and the rural middle class.''
   IMF spokesman Newman conceded that ``in any economy, when
adjustments need to be made, there are some short-term problems.''
But Newman said the fund encourages the countries to develop ``a
safety net to protect the most disadvantaged.''
   ``I suppose one has to look at the alternatives,'' Newman said.
``If countries do not put their economies back in order again,
things are only going to go from bad to worse, and the poor are
going to suffer even more.''
   In addition to barbs from liberals such as Birns and his group,
the IMF has faced opposition from economic conservatives.
   ``I think the problem is that they have essentially become a
dole,'' said Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.
``We have seen throughout Latin America that as a practical matter
countries will get money year after year even if they don't live up
to their conditions.''
   Newman took issue, saying, ``If performance criteria have not
been attained and a country wants to continue with the program,
that triggers an automatic consultation to find out what went wrong
and why it went wrong.'' He said IMF loans have been stopped in
``many, many cases.''
   Bandow also argued that IMF conditions encourage countries to
adopt protectionist measures which hurt their economies, and to
raise taxes rather than reduce spending to curb budget deficits.
   ``My guess is that the study (of the Soviet economy) may not be
a bad thing,'' Bandow said. ``The problem is that the policy of the
IMF suggests that whatever the study is the outcome isn't going to
be terribly helpful.''
   The five-month deadline for the Soviet study came as a shock to
some in organizations accustomed to more leisurely studies.
   ``We did a study of the Chinese economy many years ago,'' said
Peter Riddleberger, press manager for the World Bank. ``It took
several years, of course.''
   Hernan Puentes, a Chilean economist who is Riddleberger's
counterpart at the IMF, said, ``I tell you people are scared to
death of being asked to do it in five months. It's going to mean
sleepless nights for a lot of people.''

<HEAD>Budget Cutting Ax Out Again at Chrysler</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca is telling
his executives to cut the budget, again.
   For the second time since June 1989, Chrysler has boosted its
target for cost-cutting _ this time to $2.5 billion by the end of
June. It had been $1.5 billion by the end of this year which, in
turn, was up from the original $1 billion.
   Chrysler's cost-cutting program comes as its profits and sales
sink.
   Iacocca disclosed the latest target in an interview in Tuesday's
editions of The Wall Street Journal. Spokesman Steve Harris said
the means for removing the additional expenditures haven't been
worked out yet.
   ``Some tentative targets were being talked about,'' Harris said
Tuesday. ``We haven't formalized that yet or put the program in
place. That is a tentative target that he (Iacocca) is looking at.''
   Harris said product-development plans would be exempt from any
new round of cuts.
   ``Anything having to do with the product or customer
satisfaction is intact,'' he said.
   Industry observers generally agree that Chrysler badly needs to
introduce a new mid-size sedan as soon as possible to freshen its
lineup. The next such car is code-named ``LH'' and is due in
dealerships in late 1992 as a 1993 model.
   Also on Tuesday, Chrysler tacked seven months onto the life of
its St. Louis car plant, which employs about 2,300 workers.
Chrysler had initially planned to close the plant Sept. 21, then
delayed it until Nov. 9.
   Company spokesman Alan Miller said the factory now is due to
close May 24, at the end of production for the 1991-model Dodge
Daytona and Chrysler LeBaron coupe and convertible cars. Daytona
production will be moved to Sterling Heights, Mich., and LeBaron
production is to transfer to Newark, Del.
   Chrysler's sales this year have been slumping. Through the first
seven months of 1990, the company sold about 1.04 million cars and
light trucks, down 15.5 percent from last year.
   Iacocca said in the Journal interview that the cost cutting
prevented Chrysler from going into the red during the first half of
this year. The company made $251 million during the first six
months of 1990, 64 percent less than it made during the same period
last year.
   Part of the reason for the decline in profits has been
Chrysler's continued heavy use of incentives to prop up sales.
Company officials have said incentives cost Chrysler more than
$1,000 for every vehicle sold.
   Wall Street analysts and Chrysler executives expect the company
will lose a substantial amount of money in the third quarter,
mainly because of production interruptions at its two profitable
minivan plants. The two factories were shut down for four weeks
apiece for retooling for 1991 models.
   Chrysler has eliminated about 2,500 of its 28,700 white-collar
jobs since last October, Harris said. The cost-cutting program was
announced in July 1989.

   Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is recalling about
92,000 cars and 75,000 trucks and utility vehicles that fail to
meet federal exhaust pollution standards.
   The Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday that the
cars are 1987 Mitsubishi Mirage and Dodge Colt and Plymouth Colt
models equipped with 1.5-liter engines.
   The other vehicles are 1986 and 1987 models equipped with the
2-liter engine _ 1986 Dodge and Plymouth Colt Vistas with
four-wheel drive and two-wheel-drive Dodge Ram 50 and Mitsubishi
trucks, and 1987 Dodge and Plymouth Colt Vistas with four-wheel
drive.
   The Dodge and Plymouth models concerned are manufactured by
Mitsubishi.
   The agency said routine testing discovered that the cars emit
more than the permitted about of carbon monoxide, and the trucks
and utility vehicles emit too much carbon monoxide and unburned
fuel.
   Owners will be asked to schedule appointments at Mitsubishi or
Dodge and Plymouth dealers for modifications _ installation of a
new valve in the pollution control system of the cars and changes
in the fuel systems of the trucks and utility vehicles.

   Businesses should play a greater role in
improving schools by investing more dollars and personnel to boost
quality and prepare students for the workforce, according to a
nationwide poll.
   The Roper Organization poll was released Tuesday. Commissioned
by an affiliate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, it found 96
percent of Americans with children in public school, as well as 91
percent of all Americans, are concerned about the quality of
education in their communities.
   Three-quarters of those polled agreed that public schools are
failing to prepare students for jobs now available. Sixty-three
percent said most students will lack skills for jobs in the future.
   Most of the 1,003 adult Americans polled by telephone last month
were receptive to the involvement of business in local public
education. Ninety-one percent said it is a good idea for business
to provide equipment to schools, while 6 percent thought it was a
bad idea and 2 percent didn't know.

<HEAD>Texas Slaps Embargo on Kellogg's Heartwise Cereal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA PERLMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas officials have imposed a distribution embargo on Kellogg
Co.'s Heartwise cereal in Texas in a dispute over labeling.
   On Tuesday, the Texas Health Department ordered warehouses to
halt distribution of the cereal. It accused Kellogg of deceptive
labeling and of failing to warn consumers about potential allergic
reactions to psyllium, a whole grain touted by Kellogg as a
cholesterol fighter.
   Texas is the only state that has sought to ban sales of
Heartwise, which was introduced last year by the Battle Creek,
Mich.-based cereal maker and has prompted a federal inquiry into
the safety of psyllium.
   Last week, Kellogg filed a federal lawsuit in Dallas against the
Texas Health Department and the attorney general's office to try to
ward off the embargo and allow the company to retain its current
labeling on the product.
   ``For the state of Texas to detain Heartwise on the basis of
their belief that it's an unapproved drug is totally ridiculous and
a total disregard for the science behind psyllium,'' Kellogg
spokesman Joseph Stewart said.
   Kellogg maintains that psyllium, a grain grown mainly in India,
has been scientifically shown to help reduce cholesterol when used
as part of a complete nutritional diet. The soluble fiber is used
in laxatives and its inclusion in Heartwise has led to a
controversy in the food industry about whether the cereal should be
considered a drug or food.
   The Food and Drug Administration is currently reviewing data on
psyllium's safety and the company's cholesterol-fighting claims.
   ``I think this goes back to the labeling of foods with drug-like
claims,'' said Dan Sowards, chief of the food branch for the Texas
Department of Health. ``The FDA ... has said products that
continued to make health claims would be subject to scrutiny.''
   Sowards said his department has asked Kellogg to change the
product's name and remove heart symbols from the box as well as
references to hospital endorsements. It also has asked for
inclusion of warnings about potential allergic reactions to
psyllium.
   Sowards said data given to the FDA by Kellogg include at least
50 cases of allergic reactions to the grain and some of them
required hospitalization.
   Kellogg maintains Heartwise has been shown to be safe. Most
grains, including wheat, cause allergic reactions in a very small
percentage of people, Stewart said.
   Three independent university studies released in April found
psyllium to be more effective in fighting cholesterol than wheat or
oat bran cereals.
   Stewart said the embargo's timing _ less than a week after the
lawsuit was filed _ shows that it is ``politically motivated and
not out of any concern for public safety.''
   He said the company is worried about the controversy's affect on
the cereal's sales, which have been disappointing.
   John McMillin, a food analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities of
New York, said those worries are justified.
   ``This just might be the nail in the coffin for Heartwise,''
McMillin said. ``It is my own feeling that the state of Texas has
no business doing this ... but consumers, and the state of Texas,
seem to perceive this as a drug and not as a food.''
   General Mills Inc. pulled its psyllium-based cereal, Benefit, in
January, citing poor sales.

<TEXT>
   Boys clothes with an anti-hunting message
have been pulled from J.C. Penney Co. Inc. store shelves due to
hunter complaints, one of them from Michigan's largest conservation
and sportsmen's group.
   Duncan Muir, public relations manager for the Dallas-based
retailer, said the decision was made Tuesday after complaints from
across the nation.
   ``It is our company policy not to take a position one way or the
other on these sorts of issues. This is taking a position and an
anti- position,'' he said.
   ``Obviously, this was pointed out to us and frankly we feel
we've made a mistake. All we can do is just withdraw it from the
stores,'' he said.
   Michigan's largest conservation and sportsmen's group, Michigan
United Conservation Clubs, took aim at Penney on Friday.
   Conservation Clubs Executive Director Thomas Washington said the
clothes were a slap in the face to Michigan's million hunters. He
said the clothing's message that ``anyone who enjoys hunting is
somehow dangerous and evil, is simply outrageous.''
   A card attached to each shirt in the clothing line shows a
sketch of a bird hunter aiming a shotgun over which a large red
``X'' has been marked. Under that are the words: ``Absolutely No
Hunting of Wild and Free Animals While Wearing This Garment.''
   A similar message is stitched into an inside panel of the
garment.
   Pants have a larger card with the message: ``Wild life protected
by man surround the world with pure thoughts.'' Tags in the clothes
indicate it was made in Hong Kong.
   Penney bought the ``Environmental Protection Department'' line
of clothing from a New York company, H. Cotler Co.
   The head of the company, Howard Cotler, was in a meeting Tuesday
and didn't return telephone calls seeking comment.
   In a letter to the National Rifle Association last week, Cotler
said the anti-hunting message was a marketing tool that had been
discontinued.
   He wrote that his company ``neither condemns nor supports
anti-gun or anti-hunting legislation'' and it was trying to appeal
to the environmental awareness of young people.
   Muir said he didn't know how many pieces of clothing were being
taken off Penney store shelves. ``It's in various stages of
shipment. A lot of it is still on its way and stores order on their
own, so it's hard to say how many pieces are out there.''
   He declined to place a dollar figure on the Penney order to
Cotler, saying that was an internal inventory matter. Muir also
said the retailer hadn't decided what to do with the clothes.
   Penney is the nation's largest department store chain with 1,330
stores.

   The dollar plummeted today to its lowest close
against the Japanese yen in Tokyo this year, while the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's key index also fell to a 1990 low before recovering
somewhat.
   Analysts said the dollar and Tokyo stock prices suffered from
economic uncertainties arising from higher oil prices and
expectations of a possible easing of U.S. interest rates.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell 829.30
points, or 3.33 percent, closing at 24,078.34. This followed
plunges of 557.94 points on Monday and 512.79 points on Tuesday.
   At one point in Wednesday's trading, the index fell to
23,640.52, down 1,267.12 points from Tuesday's close and its lowest
level this year.
   The lowest closing level for the Nikkei was 23,737.63 set on
Aug. 23.
   A light 380 million shares changed hands on the first section,
up from Tuesday's 330 million shares.
   ``With the Mideast situation remaining in stalemate,
uncertainties over the world economy are making investors reluctant
to buy,'' said Toshiyuki Nishiguchi, an analyst with Daiwa
Securities.
   Nishiguchi said selling of futures by some institutional
investors to prepare for midterm account settlements this month
accelerated the index's decline.
   ``There were almost no buyers as most institutional investors
took a wait-and-see position in thin trading,'' said a dealer at a
major Japanese securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Declining issues included large-capital steel, shipbuilding,
heavy electrical machinery and paper pulp.
   The dollar closed at 142.30 yen, down 1.75 yen from Tuesday's
finish of 144.05 yen and its lowest close since 142.15 yen on Dec.
28.
   It opened at 143.08 yen and ranged between 142.17 yen and 143.25
yen.
   Masaya Ueno, a dealer with Fuji Bank, said the dollar was hit by
speculation that U.S. monetary authorities might ease credit.
   Many economists say the U.S. economy is headed into a recession
and the Federal Reserve Board, the nation's central bank, will move
to encourage lower interest rates.
   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to foreign investors.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond edged up to 8.180 percent from Tuesday's
close of 8.130 percent. The price stood at 82.76 points, down from
82.96 on Tuesday.

   The Black Hawk is the United States Army's standard transport
helicopter.
   Korean Air has made light helicopters and jet fighters. It is
one of three Korean companies designated by the Korean government
to produce aircraft as part of a consolidation of that nation's
aerospace industry.

   IBM today announced its next
generation of mainframe computers as part of a strategy designed to
ensure the large machines' place at the center of corporate
information systems.
   The world's largest computer company also announced replacement
models for several lower-level computer lines in what the company
said was its most sweeping announcement in 25 years.
   International Business Machines Corp. announced 18 new
computers, including a top-of-the-line model that provides twice
the power of its current high-end model.
   The new machines are part of what IBM calls its System-390 line,
replacing its current System-370. This is only the third mainframe
system line from IBM since the early 1960s.
   The new machines, which are called the Enterprise System-9000
family, range in price from $70,480 to $22.8 million.
   IBM says its new top-end model will be the most powerful
computer on the market, however, this model won't be available
until the third quarter of 1991. Many of the lower level models
will be available later this year or early next year.
   As part of its announcement today, IBM also disclosed new ways
to link various size computers in a network and new operating
system software for the new computer line.
   Despite the increasing popularity of smaller computers,
mainframes account for about half of IBM's profits when associated
software and equipment are included. That makes acceptance of the
new models crucial.
   The introduction of the new machines, which has been rumored for
more than a year, also is important to IBM because its competitors
are stepping up the pressure.
   The major makers of IBM-compatible mainframes, Hitachi Data
Systems Corp., Fujitsu and Amdahl Corp., all are planning major
upgrades to their machines.
   On Tuesday, Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer maker, beat IBM to
the punch. It announced a powerful new mainframe that it says is
the fastest in the world. Fujitsu officials said the top model in
their new M-1800 series is capable of executing up to 600 million
instructions per second, or mips, in scientific calculations.
However, the Fujitsu machine would not be capable of achieving that
speed in commercial applications.
   Analysts say the new top-of-the-line IBM computer will run at a
maximum speed of about 230 mips. IBM's current most-powerful
mainframe can handle about 112 mips. IBM does not disclose its mips
ratings of computers.
   IBM also said that customers will be able to link eight of the
next top-end models to operate as one machine, boosting power
dramatically.
   Fujitsu's new technology is likely to appear in mainframes
produced by Amdahl, a U.S. maker of IBM-compatible mainfames that
is 45 percent owned by Fujitsu.
   Hitachi and Amdahl traditionally undercut IBM's prices, and
their share of the U.S. mainframe market has been growing while
IBM's slipped in recent years. But IBM still holds about 87 percent
of the U.S. high-end mainframe market, according to Computer
Intelligence, a La Jolla, Calif., research firm.
   IBM compared the importance of today's announcement to the 1964
disclosure of its System-360 line, considered a milestone in the
computer industry.
   The company even rented a special Amtrak train to take reporters
from New York City to the announcement site at its Poughkeepsie
mainframe plant.
   Mainframes typically are used by large corporations such as
airlines and insurance companies to hold vast amounts of data, such
as information on millions of customer accounts.
   The new IBM machines feature fiber-optic lines to link the
computers to data-storage devices. Fiber-optic lines, which
transmit information in beams of laser light, can move data to the
computer's processor at about twice the rate of the standard
electrical lines used on the 3090s, IBM's current top machines,
helping speed processing.
   While the System-390 represents a major improvement, some
analysts say it doesn't appear to be the breakthrough they earlier
expected.
   ``It is not a qualitatively different type of technology. The
3090 is being extended,'' said Tom Willmott, a vice president of
Aberdeen Group, a Boston-based research firm.
   He doesn't think the doubling of processing power will do much
to improve the operation of data-base programs that are among the
most popular uses for high-end mainframes.
   Analysts also expressed concern that some of the new models
won't be available until the second half of 1991. That lag could
cause customers to defect to competitiors or postpone orders that
would have gone to 3090s, hurting IBM's revenues.

<HEAD>Major Japanese Banks May Face Credit Downgrading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A handful of major Japanese banks may face a
downgrading in their credit ratings following the recent dramatic
fall in the Tokyo stock market and amid pressure to improve their
profitability, an international credit rating agency said Wednesday.
   Among the banks put on ``rating watch'' by the ratings agency
IBCA are the so-called big five city banks _ Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank,
Fuji Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Sanwa Bank and Sumitomo Bank _ and the
Industrial Bank of Japan.
   These institutions currently carry a AAA rating, the highest
credit rating available.
   But IBCA noted that their results in recent years ``have been
increasingly dominated by the stock market,'' which has declined
sharply this year. That decline, coupled with the weakness of the
Japanese yen, ``have brought to an end the virtuous circle whereby
Japanese banks could finance at insignificant costs virtually any
level of growth,'' the agency's report said.
   IBCA predicted life for Japanese banks ``is going to be more
difficult for here on.''
   The big-five banks have increased their equity base by more than
300 percent over the past five years, or roughly $40 billion, the
agency said. But those gains were possible because Japanese
investors have been willing to ``put up with minimal dividends.''
IBCA said once-pliant investors may ``go on strike'' as capital
losses mount.
   Further, IBCA noted that Japanese banks have been slower than
their international peers in setting aside reserves to cover
problem foreign loans, and those losses are expected to mount.
   But the agency said its overall concerns center on high monetary
growth and the current international tensions rather than the
performance of individual banks.
   IBCA said that other Japanese banks also may be put on a ratings
watch.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices rose this morning, and most gasoline
futures traded higher in response to the uncertainties of the
Middle East standoff and increased consumer demand.
   ``As the situation keeps dragging on, the market is nervous,''
said Hartley Connett, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
``People are topping off their tanks and it's creating some very,
very good demand right now.''
   Crude oil futures were trading 13 cents higher at $29.25 per
barrel for October delivery late this morning on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Unleaded regular gasoline was down 1.32 cents to 93.20 cents per
gallon on October contracts. But gasoline futures contracts for
later months were all higher, by as much as 2.6 cents per gallon on
the contract for November delivery.
   Traders who speculate on petroleum futures have kept gasoline
prices higher in response to fears that refining capacity lost in
the embargo of Iraq and Kuwait cannot be made up, even if increased
OPEC oil production is able offset the crude shortfall. Service
stations and consumers have also been keeping their tanks fuller
than usual.
   ``Gasoline is the one that's leading us to the upside,'' Connett
said.
   On the crude futures, traders were maintaining the momentum of
higher prices reached in the European and Far East markets, Connett
said. There was no specific news from the Persian Gulf that was
affecting the oil prices, he said.
   Home heating oil prices were also higher, rising .71 cent to
83.10 cents per gallon for October delivery. Natural gas was
trading at $1.505 per 1,000 cubic feet on October contracts, down
from Tuesday's close of $1.510.

<HEAD>Soybeans Lead Crop Futures Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade after
the government reported a slight deterioration in the condition of
the U.S. soybean crop.
   The share of the soybean crop in good to excellent condition
slipped to 58 percent last week from 59 percent a week earlier,
mainly reflecting hot, dry weather in the Mississippi Delta region,
analysts said.
   The Agriculture Department's weekly crop-progress report also
showed corn and soybean development continuing to lag behind the
normal pace, leaving the crops unusually vulnerable to an early
frost.
   Today's early, across-the-board advance in grain prices followed
a powerful rally in soybean prices Tuesday that was attributed
largely to bargain hunting and chart-based speculation after last
week's sharp drop in the market.
   Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the crop markets also drew strength from
speculation the U.S. may offer the Soviet Union credit to buy
agricultural products when President Bush meets Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev this weekend.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 2\ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.58{ a bushel;
corn was \ cent to 2\ cents higher with September at $2.43 a
bushel; oats were unchanged to } cent higher with September at
$1.08{ a bushel; and soybeans were \ cent lower to 3 cents higher
with September at $6.09 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were lower and pork futures were mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .15 cent lower to .15 cent higher with
October at 76.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .32 cent lower
to .05 cent higher with September at 87 cents a pound; live hogs
were .05 cent lower to .48 cent higher with October at 49.40 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .68 cent to .70 cent higher with
February at 50 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures advanced on Tuesday.

   The Canadian Auto Workers union will focus its

said Wednesday.
   CAW President Bob White announced the decision after meeting for
several days with union leaders bargaining with subsidiaries of
Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.
   Ford of Canada's chief negotiator, Don McKenzie, said the
company welcomed the decision and said although there are a lot of
issues on the bargaining table, they could be resolved in 10 days.
   The CAW represents about 63,000 auto workers in Canada. Union
contracts with the three companies expire Sept. 14, the same as
United Auto Workers union contracts with the Big Three in the
United States. Those contracts cover more than 450,000 active auto
workers.
   The UAW has chosen GM, the industry's largest, as its bargaining
target.
   Traditionally, the UAW and the CAW bargain with the target
company and use a contract ratified with it as a pattern for the
other two.

<TEXT>
   Boise Cascade Corp. said Wednesday it has
agreed to sell its Vancouver, Wash., paper mill in the first major
step toward dramatically reducing its Pacific Northwest pulp and
paper operations.
   Appleton Papers Inc., based in Appleton, Wis., will pay about
$60 million for the mill and another $12 million for its finished
goods inventories in the deal that should be completed by year's
end.
   The mill, employing some 450 workers, has a papermaking capacity
of 100,000 tons. The Boise-based wood products company has produced
carbonless paper and other business communications papers at the
facility.
   ``The sale of the Vancouver mill will be the first major step
toward Boise Cascade's stated objective of reducing its pulp and
paper presence in the Pacific Northwest,'' Chairman John B. Fery
said. ``The sale also supports a second objective of focusing on
white paper grades other than carbonless.''
   The company, buffeted by reduced earnings in recent quarters,
announced earlier this summer it would take steps to increase
shareholder value in the 1990s.
   Appleton Papers, a subsidiary of Wiggins Teape Appleton PLC of
London, is the world's leading producer of carbonless paper and the
top U.S. producer of thermal paper. It also makes colored enamels
and other specialty coated papers at facilities in Wisconsin,
Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

   The stock market was little changed today,
contining the sluggish pattern of the past couple of sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 4.45 to 2,608.66
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 649 up, 609 down and 520
unchanged.
   Traders appeared to find little cause in the economic and
financial news to make many big changes in their positions.
   Oil prices were moderately higher today as they continued to
respond to events in the month-old showdown in the Middle East. But
interest rates declined a bit in the credit markets.
   Analysts said stock-market investors were awaiting Friday's

   An index measuring changes in help-wanted
advertising in major U.S. newspapers stayed the same in July and
was 17 points lower than a year earlier, the Conference Board said
Wednesday.
   The business research group said its Help-Wanted Index
registered 132 in July, unchanged from June's reading and down from
149 in July of last year.
   Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, said events in the
Middle East could cause businesses, including exporters, to put
some hiring plans on hold. Prior to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, the economy, and the labor market in particular, appeared
poised for modest improvement, he said.
   ``Now it is more likely that exporters, business investors, and
consumers will put some plans on hold until the economic and
political situation in the Persian Gulf becomes more clear,''
Goldstein said.
   ``For the labor market, that probably means no big staff
expansions over the next few months and little chance of want-ad
volume quickly turning around,'' he said.
   Parts of the country in which oil plays an economic role could
experience job gains if the recent spike in oil prices encourages
growth in oil exploration, the board said in a news release.
   The Conference Board, based in New York, collects information
for its Help-Wanted Index from 51 big newspapers around the country
each month. Ad volume is sensitive to labor market conditions and
considered to be a gauge of changes in the supply of jobs at the
local, regional and national levels.

   Jury selection began today in what promised to be
a lengthy and complicated trial of 14 currency traders charged in a
wide-ranging probe of corruption in the city's commodities pits.
   The defendants, all traders of Japanese yen futures contracts,
face 393 counts stemming from allegedly illegal trading practices
at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Jury selection began before U.S. District Court Judge William T.
Hart, said a clerk in Hart's chambers who declined to be identified
by name.
   Hart has set opening statements for next Tuesday in the trial,
which is expected to last four months.
   A 15th defendant, Martin Riley Jr., pleaded no contest during
pretrial motions Tuesday to one count of mail fraud and two counts
of violating the Commodities Exchange Act, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Dan Gillogly. Riley, a trader in the Japanese Yen pit,
listed financial and health reasons when entering the plea.
   Hart accepted the plea conditionally until he reviewed Riley's
financial and health records, Gillogly said.
   The trial is the second major trial stemming from an undercover
FBI investigation at the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The 14 defendants are accused of violating the Commodities
Exchange Act by executing trades outside the open-outcry system at
the futures exchanges.
   In all, 48 people have been indicted in the probe. FBI agents
posed as traders and secretly tape recorded conversations that
prosecutors said revealed fraud among traders at the Merc and the
CBOT.
   In the first trial, a federal jury convicted two Swiss franc
traders on relatively minor trading violations. A third trader was
acquitted.
   The jury in that trial failed to reach verdicts on scores of
more serious charges, including a racketeering count against one of
the defendants and mail and wire-fraud charges against all three.
   The scandal prompted the Merc, the CBOT and their regulators to
adopt tougher anti-fraud measures. And Congress is considering
regulatory changes to strengthen the markets' integrity.
   Yen trader Aric March pleaded guilty Aug. 24 to two counts of
mail and commodities fraud. As part of a plea agreement, the
government agreed to drop fraud charges against him. According to
court documents, the government had accused March of prearranging
trades of S&amp;P 500 futures with another broker.
   March is expected to testify in the other yen traders' trial.
   Six of those traders are charged with racketeering conspiracy,
and all are charged with wire and commodities fraud.
   The trial of 12 CBOT soybean futures traders is scheduled to
begin Monday before U.S. District Judge George Marovich.
   One soybean trader who was to go on trial before Marovich
pleaded guilty in late August to racketeering and tax fraud. The
trader, James D. Nowak, was charged last year with two counts of
racketeering, more than 200 counts of fraud and violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act.

   Share prices finished higher on the London Stock
Exchange Wednesday, although off the day's best levels in
low-volume trading.
   The release of disappointing interim results for several
companies caused a nervous start to the session, dealers said.
   But a positive opening on Wall Street boosted enthusiasm.
   ``London was looking for a lead, and Wall Street was as good as
anything,'' one trader said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 4.2
points to 2,   British officials said 30 British women and children trying
to
join that convoy in Kuwait were detained, but there were no details
on why they had been stopped.
   The Iraqi News Agency on Wednesday quoted an unidentified
government spokesman as saying Iraq was doing its best to speed up
the departure of foreign women and children.
   ``Iraq endeavors with all possible means to ensure their
departure in cooperation with concerned countries,'' the news
agency reported. It said ``all border points were open for their
departure, and the Iraqi Airways was ready to lease its aircraft
for flying them to any capital.''
   More than 700 Western detainees _ women, children and a few
ailing men _ left aboard two Iraqi Airways flights on Saturday in
the first major airlift since Saddam announced they could go. Some
evacuees also have traveled across the desert to neighboring
countries.
   But the departures of others have been complicated by Iraq's
refusal to allow foreign airlines to land in Baghdad and by long
delays in processing exit permits. About 11,000 Westerners are now
believed stranded in Kuwait and Iraq.
   Most of the evacuees were women, young children and teen-agers,
but some elderly and ailing men were also aboard the flights.
   On Tuesday, 135 foreigners, mostly West Germans, flew into Amman
on a charter from Baghdad and then transferred to a Lufthansa
flight.
   British millionaire Branson, owner of Virgin Atlantic, arrived
in Amman with one of six jumbo jets he lent at the request of
Jordan's American-born Queen Noor. He said he was worried more by
the plight of stranded Asian refugees in Jordan than by Westerners,
who are coming home.
   ``What we are doing is only a pittance,'' he said. ``Children
and old people are dying. We need a massive airlift and ships. This
is something the United Nations should do.''
   He urged that all flights coming in to repatriate Asian refugees
carry supplies for the more than 100,000 people housed in squalid
camps in Jordan.

<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co. said Wednesday the costs
of a previously-disclosed corporate restructuring left it with a
loss of $238.4 million in its fourth fiscal quarter despite an 11
percent increase in sales.
   The loss for the quarter ended July 29 amounted to $1.84 per
share. The foods company lost $194.7 million, or $1.51 a share, in
the same period a year earlier.
   Its fourth-quarter sales rose to $1.44 billion from $1.3 billion
in 1989.
   For the fiscal year, the company reported a profit of $4.4
million, or 3 cents per share, down 66 percent from $13.1 million,
or 10 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the year rose 8.8 percent to $6.2 billion from $5.7
billion a year ago.
   Results were depressed by a charge for divestitures and
restructuring of $301.6 million in the latest fiscal year, and by a
restructuring charge of $260.8 million in the previous fiscal year.
   The company had announced in late June that it would take a $247
million charge for the year to cover the sale of several North
American businesses, including most of its fresh and refrigerated
products, and the closing of three facilities in Fremont, Neb.,
Grand Prarie, Texas, and Moorestown, N.J.
   That was in addition to planned charges for the year of about
$55 million for the sale of five European operations.
   ``We have reorganized and restructured to eliminate the
inefficient and unprofitable,'' said David Johnson, Campbell
president and chief executive.
   ``This will improve earnings, returns and cash by reducing
overheads and increasing manufacturing capacity utilization and by
refocusing the company on its core businesses,'' Johnson said.
   Timothy S. Ramey, an analyst for County NatWest USA, said the
earnings came as no surprise.
   ``It's really on line with expectations,'' Ramey said. ``What
this company is trying to do is present a lean and meaner structure.
   ``We'll see after this restructuring how lean and mean it is,''
said Ramey.

<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC, a tobacco and financial
services conglomerate, on Wednesday reported a 17 percent increase
in net profits in the first half of the year.
   The increase, however, came on an extraordinary gain, and the
company's pre-tax profit was down 11 percent from the same period a
year ago.
   BAT said net profit for the six months ended June 30 came to 773
million pounds, or $1.47 billion, compared to 660 million pounds,
or $1.25 billion, in the previous six months.
   Earnings per share fell 20 percent, to 20.7 pence (39 cents)
from 25.5 pence (48.5 cents) a year earlier.
   Pre-tax profit was 592 million pounds ($1.125 billion) compared
to 668 million pounds ($1.27 billion).
   Sales rose 12 percent to 9.49 billion pounds ($18.03 billion),
compared to 8.48 billion pounds ($16.11 billion) in the
year-earlier period.
   The earnings report included 468 million pounds in extraordinary
gains, largely from BAT's restructuring program. The program
included the disposal of assets and spinoff of Wiggins Teape
Appleton, a paper and pulp manufacturer, and the Argos retail chain.
   A year earlier the group had an extraordinary gain of 270
million pounds. ``I am pleased with the growth trends in both our
tobacco and financial services activities,'' said BAT Chairman
Patrick Sheehy. However, he said, the weakness of the dollar and
declines in world stock markets could affect earnings from the
company's core businesses for the year.

<TEXT>
   The beverage giant Seagram Co. Ltd. said
Wednesday a strong performance in its business outside North Amrica
helped lift its earnings by 3 percent in the second quarter
compared with a year ago.
   The Montreal-based Seagram said its results rose despite a
charge for a previously announced staff reduction in its U.S.
spirits business and continued higher fruit costs for its Tropicana
beverages.
   Seagram said it earned $205 million, or $2.18 a share, in the
three months ended July 31 compared with $199 million, or $2.07 a
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 8.7 percent to $1.42 billion from
$1.30 billion a year earlier.
   Operating income rose 8.6 percent for the quarter to $152
million from $140 million a year earlier.
   Edgar Bronfman, president and chief operating officer, said the
improvement in operating income and revenue ``are due primarily to
the continued strong business performance of Seagram International
in all regions.'' Seagram International covers Seagram's business
outside North America.
   He said the company's Brazilian affiliate outperformed
expectations, but the company is cautious about its prospects for
the full year.
   Seagram announced July 17 that it was eliminating 177 positions
in sales and marketing in its U.S. spirits business, called The
House of Seagram. Only about 140 of those positions were filled at
the time. The company has never disclosed the magnitude of the
charge but said it expects to save about $15 million annually as a
result of the cutbacks.
   The results included $65 million in dividends and $99 million in
unremitted earnings on its 24.3 percent stake in E.I. du Pont de
Nemours and Co., up from $57 million in dividends and $105 million
in unremitted earnings a year ago.
   For the first six months, Seagram earned $392 million, or $4.15
a share, down slightly from $395 million, or $4.07 a share, a year
earlier.
   Sales for the first half rose 7.1 percent to $2.71 billion from
$2.53 billion a year earlier.
   Earnings per share rose for the six months despite the decline
in earnings because there were fewer shares outstanding.

   Zapata Corp. said Wednesday it has signed a
definitive agreement to sell its offshore drilling rig fleet to
Bermuda-based Arethusa Ltd. for $298 million.
   The Houston-based corporation will own 8.75 percent of the new
company and continue to manage the 12 rigs, Zapata officials said.
   ``The rig sale agreement is a major milestone in Zapata's
comprehensive restructuring,'' said R.C. Lassiter, Zapata's
chairman and chief executive officer. ``The company can now focus
its attention on a tender offer for its outstanding subordinated
debentures and on obtaining necessary stockholder approval.''
   Company officials announced Aug. 23 Zapata had reached an
agreement with bankers to restructure $560 million of debt. The
cash tender offer for subordinated debentures will be the final
step in the restructuring.
   The tender offer is expected to begin in early October when a
proxy statement and offer documents are ready for distribution,
company officials said.
   The sales transaction is expected to close Oct. 31 with Zapata
investing $17.5 million of the $298 million in gross sales proceeds
in an 8.75 percent interest in Arethusa Ltd. Of the remaining
$280.5 million, $7.7 million will be used to pay commissions
related to the rig sale and $53.6 million will be used to repay
rig-specific debt.

   The eight-year battle over the Salt
Caves hydroelectric project is a Western showdown reminiscent of
those between free-range cattlemen and fence-building homesteaders.
   But this fight is between a coalition of a city, developers, a
local congressman and a federal agency facing an alliance of state
agencies, voters, out-of-town congressmen, fishermen, and
environmentalists.
   At issue is an 11-mile stretch of the Klamath River 27 miles
southwest of Klamath Falls in south-central Oregon.
   Initial proposals by the city of Klamath Falls would have
drowned the river behind a dam, but the proposal now is for no dam
at all _ just a series of canals and conduits bringing water from
an existing dam upstream. That hasn't lessened opposition.
   Opponents say the project would destroy the last free-flowing,
trout-filled stretch of a waterway already shackled by four dams.
Supporters say the project can generate millions of dollars to help
Klamath Falls get back on its feet after a decade of decline.

birth from her passport. She left more than $2.8 million in cash,
no traceable next of kin, no will, no birth certificate, no
marriage certificate, and a growing list of claimants to her
fortune.
   So far, 31 people have come forward, claiming to be heirs of the
woman known in British newspapers as ``the vanishing lady.''
   By law, claimants have 12 years to prove they are blood
relatives. If they fail, the fortune goes to the state treasury.
   Treasury lawyers ordered the sale of her effects, including mink
coats, a 1972 Rolls-Royce Corniche and a 1964 Daimler, jewelry,
paintings, furniture, silver and other trappings from a glamorous
past that by some accounts included a trip across the dance floor
with Fred Astaire.
   The sale, conducted Tuesday by Sotheby's at her 300-year-old

the village of Sutton-under-Brailes 90 miles northwest of London,
is expected to fetch another $1.3 million when it is sold.

   Sex may be on the minds of nearly everybody, but
a new Kinsey Institute survey finds that most Americans don't know
much about it.
   Fifty-five percent of those surveyed flunked a test of basic
sexual knowledge, Kinsey director June Reinisch said Wednesday.
   Only about 25 percent knew that the typical American has first
intercourse at age 16 to 17, or that an estimated 30 percent to 40
percent of married men have had an extramarital affair, the report
said.
   Only 21 percent knew that more than a quarter of American men
have had a sexual experience with another male as an adolescent or
adult. Half incorrectly thought that rectal intercourse itself can
cause AIDS, even if neither partner was infected by the AIDS virus.
   The poll's 18 questions were drawn from those most often asked
of the Kinsey Institute, and represent facts that ``people need to
know for both their physical health and their mental health,''
Reinisch said in an interview.

   Otis Elevator Co.'s German operation
has signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in an East
German elevator maker, the Farmington-based company announced
Wednesday.
   The East German company, Berliner Aufzugs-und Fahrtreppenbau
GmbH, or BAF, is a subsidiary of a government-owned conglomerate
and employs 1,000 workers. The agreement is subject to approval by
government agencies in West Germany and East Germany. Terms were
not disclosed.
   BAF, which supplies and services electric passenger and freight
elevators in East Germany, operates two manufacturing facilities in
East Berlin and several small branch offices. The joint operations
will manufacture, install and maintain elevator equipment using
Otis designs, technology and installation and maintenance methods.
   ``With Germany moving rapidly toward full unification, this
acquisition positions Otis to capitalize on emerging growth
opportunities in the region,'' said J.P. Van Rooy, Otis executive
vice president and chief operating officer.
   In recent weeks, Otis announced separate agreements to establish
manufacturing joint ventures in the Soviet Union and Hungary.
   Otis, the world's largest elevator manufacturer, had 1989
revenues of $3.3 billion, of which 70 percent came from outside the
U.S. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ha ordered a trial for
two men
and a woman accused of trying to illegally export nuclear

   The three defendants, who were released on bail, did not enter a
plea with the magistrates in Brent, a borough in northwest London.
   The accused are Toufic Fouad Amyuni, 37, a Lebanese engineer;
Ali Ashour Daghir, 49, an executive with dual Iraqi and British
nationality; and Jeanine Celestine Speckman, 41, a Frenchwomen

   Daghir's company, Euromac Ltd., was order to face trial on the
same charge. No trial date was set.
   The accusations relate to an attempt to export 40 electrical
capacitors through London's Heathrow airport and other places in
Britain.
   A consignment of U.S.-made capacitors was seized at Heathrow in
March by British authorities working with the United States. At the
time, U.S. prosecutors said the devices could be used for
detonating nuclear warheads.
   Britain later expelled an Iraqi Airways executive in connection
with an alleged plot to smuggle the devices.
   In 1981, Israeli warplanes destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor
believed capable of producing nuclear arms. Israeli officials say
Iraq is now trying to restore its program.

   ``We believe this is clearly different from anything that's out
there today,'' said Paul V. Cahn, vice president of reprographics
and customer service marketing.
   ``The customer is the sole arbiter and decision-maker. With
virtually every other guarantee or warranty, the company decides
whether a replacement is needed.''
   David Schofield, an industry analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in
Chicago, said the guarantee ``might help ease a little buyer
fear,'' and is probably more psychological than anything else.
   ``I don't know that it's going to be a huge boost to sales,'' he
said. ``I agree with them that it probably won't cost a whole lot,
either.''
   James J. Miller, Xerox's manager of reprographic product
marketing, said the company does not expect the guarantee to be a
major expense.
   ``We don't think that we're going to get a lot of machines
back,'' he said.
   For the past two years, Xerox has offered three-year warranties
covering repairs on most of its low-volume consumer products. Under
those warranties, the company decided whether or not to replace a
machine, Cahn said.
   The new guarantee supplements existing warranties and applies to
machines bought, rented or leased from Xerox or an authorized
dealer. Customers must have a Xerox service contract.
   Cahn said Xerox expects the guarantee to increase sales in all
areas. The pledge will be extensively advertised over the next few
weeks, he said.
   ``Standing behind Xerox equipment to the point of replacement is
good for the customer and it's good for Xerox,'' he said.
   Xerox also announced the introduction of two new small copiers,
the Xerox 5034 and the 5011 R-E.

<HEAD>Announce Plan for Electronic Trading of Unregistered Securities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Stock Exchange on Wednesday
announced plans to develop an electronic system with Reuters
Holdings PLC for trading securities in the $170 billion private
placement market.
   The announcement follows a recent rule change by the Securities
and Exchange Commission making it easier for securities firms to
sell unregistered stocks and bonds to big institutions.
   Amex said the new electronic marketplace for trading the
securities is expected to be implemented in the first half of 1991
and will be called the System for Institutional Trading of
Unregistered Securities, of SITUS.
   Amex Chairman James R. Jones said in a statement the new system
would ``help companies from any country to gain access to a rich
and largely untapped source of capital liquidity.''
   The SEC's new rule 144a exempts U.S. and foreign institutions
from registration requirements for the sale of stocks and bonds to
big institutions. The market is used largely to sell corporate debt.
   The rule was expected to give a boost to the securities industry
during a slump in trading of stocks and bonds on the public market
and other business areas. But activity there has slumped as well.
   U.S. private placement financings fell by one third in the first
half of 1990 to $55.3 billion from $82.1 billion a year earlier,
IDD Information Services said Tuesday.
   The drop occurred despite the SEC rule change and a drying up in
the junk bond market as a source for corporate financing, IDD said.
   Under the agreement for private placement electronic trading,
SITUS owuld be a division or subsidiary of the exchange.
   The exchange would be responsible for regulating and
administering the system, which would be developed, operated, owned
and maintained by Reuters, a worldwide business news-gathering and
information-distribution organization.

<HEAD>Four Years After Merger, Unisys Struggles To Return To
Profitability</HEAD>

   All's not happy here on Jolly Road, home
of the nation's third-largest computer company.
   Unisys Corp., the behemoth created by Burroughs Corp.'s 1986
purchase of Sperry Corp., is struggling mightily to make money once
again after reporting a staggering $639 million loss last year.
   Since last October, it has slashed more than 8,000 jobs, closed
plants and refocused its mishmash of inherited product lines.
   Still, the red ink keeps flowing. In July, Unisys reported a
$45.1 million loss in the year's first half after paying
preferred-stock dividends. Two weeks ago, the company's stock price
plunged to a 52-week low after several industry analysts reduced
their earnings forecasts.
   The cutbacks, losses and a Pentagon bribery scandal at the
Unisys defense division are said to have taken their toll on morale
among the company's 78,000 employees.
   But the payback from the belt-tightening should appear later
this year, analysts say, when they expect Unisys to report a profit
in the fourth quarter.
   ``Once those plants are closed and the benefits start flowing
through, it's virtually impossible to build a scenario where
they're not in the black,'' said Rick Martin, an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The situation wasn't always bleak. Most observers agree
Burroughs' $4.8 billion merger with Sperry initially was a success.
The consolidation of the two old-line computer companies led to a
streamlining that cut costs and improved profits.
   In a burst of optimism, W. Michael Blumenthal, the Burroughs
chairman who engineered the merger, launched the renamed company on
an ambitious plan to double annual sales to $20 billion by 1993. He
predicted Unisys would rival International Business Machines Corp.,
the world's largest computer maker.
   But the scheme of the former U.S. Treasury secretary flopped.
The computer industry's breakneck growth slowed to a trot in the
late 1980s and major corporations began to move away from large
mainframe computers _ Unisys' mainstay product _ to smaller models.
   That left Unisys with warehouses full of unsold computers and
unneeded production lines, analysts say.
   ``You don't take two slow-growing companies and turn them into
one fast growing company,'' said Martin.
   With profits strangled, Unisys was forced to borrow up to $1.5
billion to pay shareholder dividends, analysts say, pumping up its
debt to a high of $4.1 billion last year.
   Unisys also saw its important government business drop last year
when its defense unit was barred from bidding on contracts for
three months as part of the ``Ill Winds'' probe of Pentagon fraud.
Several Unisys executives pleaded guilty to bribery and Unisys
still faces a possible fine.
   To help fix the problems, Blumental in October announced the
sweeping restructuring, taking a $231 million charge against
earnings to pay for it. In April, he relinquished day-to-day
control and his chief executive title to James A. Unruh, a longtime
Burroughs executive.
   In a recent interview, Unruh spoke frankly about the company's
troubles.
   ``We had a very difficult 1989. It seemed like whatever could go
wrong did go wrong,'' he said at the company's sprawling
headquarters complex in this Philadelphia suburb.
   Unruh admitted Unisys misjudged the U.S. computer industry
slowdown, but noted the company's plight wasn't unique.
   Digitial Equipment Corp., the world's second-largest computer
company, reported its first-ever quarterly loss earlier this year
and has eliminated thousands of jobs. IBM also has been cutting
costs.
   The industry is undergoing a painful transition as large
computers are losing favor to cheaper _ and less profitable _
midsize and desktop models that often are linked in networks.
   In addition, companies increasingly want computers that use
industry-standard operating systems, the base layer of software
that controls internal computer functions. With the move to these
``open'' systems, which Unisys has joined, profits have been
squeezed as computers become more like interchangeable commodities.
   Unruh said the cutbacks have been painful both to him and
employees.
   ``Closing plants is not a pleasant process. Reducing employment
is not a pleasant process at all,'' said the soft-spoken North
Dakota native, whose team-oriented management style is said to
differ markedly from that of the more demonstrative Blumenthal.
   Unruh, 49, said no more major cutbacks are planned, but he
wouldn't rule them out if the economy continues to sour. Unisys
also could be hurt by a steeper-than-expected scaleback in U.S.
defense spending, which accounts for about 22 percent of its
revenue, he said.
   Unisys, which traces its history to the first successful
electronic computer, the giant ENIAC machine built at the
University of Pennsylvania in the mid-1940s, has reorganized its
operations around customer lines of business instead of the size of
its computers.
   For example, it has targeted the airline, health care,
insurance, banking and phone companies, among others, as areas
where it can offer specialized software and services, along with
Unisys computers.
   The strategy is a contrast from past practice, Unruh said, when
Unisys would tell its customers, `` `We've got the next bigger,
faster box for you. Here it is. Good luck.' Because that's where we
stopped.''
   By becoming an expert in particular businesses, and providing
specialized software, Unisys can differentiate itself from
competitors who also are promoting industry-standard computers,
Unruh said.
   Sensing that hooking computers in a network was a growing trend,
Unisys made two major acquistions in 1988: Timeplex Inc., a maker
of networking equipment, which it acquired in a $300 million stock
swap, and Convergent Technologies Inc., a maker of networked
desktop computers, which it bought for $350 million.
   Unisys says it will provide ways to use mainframe computers as
the ``information hub'' of computer networks that adhere to
industry standards at the desktop level.
   A strategy based on networked, industry-standard computers is
not foolproof, said Wendy Abramowitz, an analyst at Argus Research
Corp., a New York investment research firm. Almost every computer
company is singing the same song, making it a very competitive
market, she said.
   Also, the company must not alienate its many longtime mainframe
customers, analysts say. These machines will be based on the old
Burroughs and Sperry proprietary systems for the foreseeable future.
   Debt reduction is another area Unruh has targeted. The company
announced in June it would sell $150 million in convertible
preferred stock to Mitsui &amp; Co., Unisys' longtime Japanese business
partner, to reduce Unisys' debt by that amount.
   That also could help boost Unisys' stock price, which sank to
around $8 a share in recent weeks from a high of $30.25 last year.
   ``I can understand why the stock price has gone down. People
want to see results,'' said Unruh. ``The actions to be taken are
just the basic actions of turning the business around.''

<HEAD>Spain Seeking Fiat Again to Buy State's Truckmaker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is seeking to get Italy's
Fiat group back in the bidding for its ailing state truckmaker
Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones SA (Enasa), because its earlier
deal with Germany's Daimler-Benz AG has collapsed, a newspaper said.
   Spain's leading daily El Pais Wednesday reported that Spanish
Industry Ministry officials opened talks with Fiat after an
agreement for a joint buyout by Daimler-Benz and Man AG fell apart.
   In a decision last November, the Spanish government gave the nod
to a joint bid for Enasa by Daimler-Man over offers by Fiat SpA,
Anglo-Dutch truckmaker DAF NV, and AB Volvo of Sweden.
   Daimler-Man had offered to pay 36 billion pesetas, or about $380
million, for a total 80 percent stake. Enasa's state owner, the
National Industrial Institute, would hold the rest.
   But in July, the West German Federal Cartel office stunned Spain
by blocking the purchase on antitrust grounds, even though the West
German government had strongly lobbied Spain for the deal.
   El Pais said Industry Ministry Claudio Aranzadi traveled to
Turin, Italy, in early August to meet with Fiat managing director
Cesare Romiti.
   On Wednesday, an Industry spokesman said talks with Daimler-Benz
continued, but he declined to confirm or deny contacts had been
made with Fiat officials.
   A Fiat spokesman said he had no knowledge of meetings with
Spanish officials.
   Enasa posted profits last year of 240 million pesetas, or $2.47
million, ending years of losses.

<HEAD>Dollar Off Sharply, Gold Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The dollar sank against all major foreign
currencies Wednesday in trading punctuated by widespread talk of
lower U.S. interest rates.
   Gold prices moved higher in most world trading centers.
   Heavy dollar selling began in Asia and carried over into later
European and U.S. dealing.
   The sales were triggered by speculation that the Federal Reserve
soon might seek to foster a U.S. economic rebound by pushing
interest rates down. Falling U.S. rates would reduce returns on
dollar holdings and lessen investment interest in dollars.
   Currency dealers said the dollar also was hampered by
speculation that West Germany and Japan soon may raise their
interest rates. Higher rates in those countries, especially if U.S.
rates go down, would tend to spur demand for marks and yen.
   Commenting on the dollar's selloff, analyst David Marshall of
MMS International said, ``I think on the whole it was a lot of
speculation about the Fed easing. There was speculation about U.S.
rates moving down and other rates moving up.''
   Financial markets are awaiting the government's monthly
unemployment report, due Friday, for indications of the economy's
condition in August. Evidence of new softening in the labor market
would bolster the case for the central bank to loosen its monetary
policy.
   Remarks Wednesday by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that the
United States will regret involvement in the Middle East appeared
to have only a minor impact on the dollar. If the Persian Gulf
situation stokes inflation and stalls the U.S. economy, the dollar
would suffer.
   One of the most pronounced moves of the day was the dollar's
drop against the yen. It was quoted at 141.65 yen late in New York
trading, down from 143.40 on Tuesday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar
fell to a closing 142.30 Japanese yen from 144.05 yen at Tuesday's
close and in London it fell to 141.75 yen.
   The British pound gained against the dollar. Sterling
strengthened in New York with a pound fetching $1.9055 in late
trading, compared to $1.8810 Tuesday. In London, the British pound
rose to $1.8990 from $1.8750 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.5580 German marks, down from 1.58115;
1.2945 Swiss francs, down from 1.3135; 5.2180 French francs, down
from 5.2965; 1,162.00 Italian lire, down from 1,179.00; and 1.15245
Canadian dollars, down from 1.16075.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with levels late
Tuesday were: 1.5630 West German marks, down from 1.5843; 1.2963
Swiss francs, down from 1.3170; 5.2375 French francs, down from
5.3105; 1.7607 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7860; 1,166.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,182.25; and 1.1532 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1623.
   Bullion dealers said gold prices rose in reaction to the weaker
dollar.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold for
September delivery added $2.40 to settle at $386.10. Republic
National Bank later quoted a bid of $387.20 for a ounce of gold, up
$2.60 from Tuesday's 4 p.m. EDT bid.
   Gold moved to a late bid of $387.75 a troy ounce in London, up
from $382.50 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a
closing bid of $385.75 from Tuesday's late bid of $382.25. Earlier,
in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.33 to close at a bid of $384.02.
   Silver rose in New York and London. On the Commodity Exchange, a
troy ounce of silver for September delivery rose to $4.735 from
Tuesday's settlement of $4.719. Silver bullion rose in London to a
late bid of $4.78 a troy ounce from $4.75 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Wheat Rebounds on Hopes U.S. Will Give Soviets Food Credit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices rebounded strongly Wednesday on the Chicago
Board of Trade, ending a six-day decline amid speculation the
United States will offer food credits to the Soviet Union.
   Other grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher after the
Agriculture Department reported a slight deterioration in the
condition of the U.S. soybean crop.
   On other commodity markets, oil and precious metal futures
advanced and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Wheat futures settled 3{ cents to 6} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $2.63 a bushel; corn futures
were 1\ cents lower to 2{ cents higher with September at $2.43\ a
bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with September at
$1.08} a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents lower to 5 cents higher
with September at $6.11} a bushel.
   Wheat's rally represented the market's first upward move since
Aug. 24, when the September contract settled at $2.84} a bushel.
The September price fell 28{ cents, or about 10 percent, in the
interim, reflecting an abundance of wheat on the world market due
to favorable growing conditions in much of the Northern Hemisphere.
   Analysts said speculation that the United States will offer the
Soviets food credits mounted after Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter said Wednesday that deteriorating Soviet food supplies
could warrant a technical exemption from a law prohibiting such
credits to countries that are not among America's most-favored
trading partners.
   ``I think they're going to get credit,'' said Katharina Zimmer,
grains analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
   ``Considering how the Soviet Union has supported the U.S.
position in the Persian Gulf, I'd be willing to bet you five bucks
they will get it,'' she said.
   Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said rumors circulated that President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev would strike a deal on food
credits at their meeting this weekend. But Frick said she doubted
the process would move that quickly.
   Oil prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange as tensions
rose in the Persian Gulf. The higher prices extended Tuesday's
sharp gains and reignited inflation fears, which prompted a runup
in precious metal futures prices on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Among other developments in the Gulf, Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein said Wednesday that ``the children in Iraq are dying''
because of U.N.-supported economic sanctions, but he appeared to
retract an earlier appeal for foreign help to circumvent the
embargo.
   Saddam also renewed his call for an Islamic holy war to defeat
Western forces and overthrow Arab leaders aligned against him,
singling out Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
   On the New York Merc, light sweet crude oil futures finished 33
cents to 76 cents higher with October at $29.77 a barrel; heating
oil was .98 cent to 2.74 cents higher with October at 83.37 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was 2.25 cents lower to 2.71 cents higher
with October at 92.27 cents a gallon.
   On the Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled $2.40 to $2.70
higher with September at $386.10 a troy ounce; silver was 0.8 cent
to 1.6 cents higher with September at $4.735 a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures ended narrowly mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange with support provided by higher-than-expected top steer
prices paid in the Southern Plains.
   Pork futures were mostly higher, reflecting higher cash markets
and expectations for stronger pork demand.
   Live cattle futures settled .07 cent lower to .25 cent higher
with October at 77.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent
lower to .08 cent higher with September at 87.02 cents a pound;
hogs were .03 cent lower to .35 cent higher with October at 49.27

   Oil prices rose to nearly $30 per barrel
Wednesday as traders began buying in response to Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein's televised call for an Arab holy war against the
West.
   Light sweet crude for October delivery rose 65 cents to close at
$29.77 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price
rose as high as $29.89 before falling back.
   ``It was full of religious fanaticism, and I think people kind
of got nervous and started bidding the market back up,'' said Brian
Tagler, a broker with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   ``We're getting close to that $30 mark, and it looks like people
might want to get up there and test that $30 area,'' he said.
   Traders also said prices were partially keeping pace with a
bullish oil market in Europe.
   Other petroleum futures were mixed.
   Unleaded gasoline dropped 2.25 cents to 92.27 cents per gallon
for October delivery. Speculators were either taking profits from
the previous day's jump or selling gasoline so they could buy more
crude, said Randall Rothenberg, a broker with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   Later contract months for gasoline were up.
   Home heating oil for October rose .98 cent to 83.37 cents per
gallon, while later months were also up. Natural gas was up to
$1.514 per 1,000 cubic feet, compared with Tuesday's close of
$1.510.
   Traders said Wednesday's rise in oil prices was also partly
attributable to speculation on Wall Street that the American
Petroleum Institute on Wednesday would report a decline in the
nation's stockpiles of crude.
   The API report, which is released after the markets close, said
crude stocks for the week ending Aug. 31 were at 372.2 million
barrels, down from 376.6 million barrels a week earlier but up from
335.8 million barrels a year earlier.
   Crude imports were up to 6.8 million barrels a day, compared
with imports of 6.6 million barrels a week earlier and 6.4 million
barrels a year earlier, API said.
   Crude stocks were down because companies were drawing on their
supplies, Tagler said.
   The stockpile of gasoline was virtually unchanged for the week
at 210.5 million barrels. Imports stood at 192,000 barrels,
compared with 287,000 barrels a week earlier and 221,000 barrels a
year earlier.
   Analysts have attributed the drop in gasoline imports to
supplies that were diverted to other buyers after the boycott of
Iraq and Kuwait cut into the world's refining capacity. Companies
also traditionally try to avoid holding onto too much gasoline
after Labor Day, considered to be the end of the peak summer
driving season, an API spokesman said.
   The price of gasoline dropped at the pump, the American
Automobile Association reported Wednesday. The nationwide average
price for a gallon of self-serve unleaded regular was $1.273, down
3.4 cents from a week earlier, the AAA said.
   The retail pump price remained about 19.8 cents higher than on
Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait, the AAA said.
   A spokesman for the Service Station Dealers of America said the
decrease was attributable to lower prices charged by gasoline
suppliers.

   IBM unveiled a new generation of
mainframe computers Wednesday that it said would double the power
of its most profitable machines and cement their position at the
center of office computing.
   The announcement, made at the company's U.S. mainframe factory,
was billed as the most important rollout for International Business
Machines Corp. in 25 years.
   The success of the new machines is crucial to the world's
largest computer company because it derives about half its income
from mainframes and associated equipment and software.
   The move was well publicized in advance, but industry experts
were still impressed with the scope of the company's new strategy.
   The announcement crystallized a new vision for how IBM believes
mainframe computers should fit into today's decentralized computer
systems, where desktop machines are almost as common as telephones.
   ``You saw it piecemeal before,'' said industry consultant Sam
Albert. The new machines show that IBM intends the mainframe to be
the ``traffic cop'' of computer networks, said Albert, a former IBM
executive.
   In addition to annoucing 18 new machines, IBM said it would
provide systems that will allow mainframes to manage information on
all sorts of computers throughout a company.
   Such systems would address the growing concern of companies that
too much information is spread among desktop computers that don't
communicate well with each other.
   The company said it also will provide products that will make it
easier to connect non-IBM computers to a network of IBM machines.
   IBM's new mainframes provide about twice the processing power of
the three mainframe lines they replace and are priced from $70,480
to $22.8 million. The line is IBM's response to several Japanese
mainframe makers that recently announced new high-end models.
   On Tuesday, Fujitsu Ltd. announced a new mainframe it said would
be the world's fastest. IBM dismissed that claim, saying it has
provided the most powerful machines for years and will continue to
do so.
   The new computers are part of a model line IBM calls System-390.
It is intended to be the successor to IBM's original mainframe
line, the System-360, which was introduced in 1964, and the
System-370, introduced in 1970.
   Among the machines' advances are fiber-optic lines that,
compared with the copper lines they replace, more than double the
rate at which information can be transferred to the computers from
the huge data-storage devices used with mainframes.
   The fiber-optic lines, which transmit data as flashes of laser
light, also allow the data-storage devices to be located several
miles from the computers themselves, instead of several hundred
feet with copper cable. IBM said that would give customers more
flexibility in locating computer rooms.
   IBM also will provide the means to link together up to eight of
the new models to vastly increase processing power. This is the
first time IBM has provided such a linkup.
   In addition, IBM announced the first encryption device that can
built into a computer. The optional coding device would be useful
to protect the security of transactions such as electronic funds
tranfers between banks, the company said. It also said the Central
Intelligence Agency has expressed interest in the device.
   IBM also said it will sell devices that can boost the power of
the most powerful model of the new line to supercomputer status.
Supercomputers are used for such calculation-intensive tasks as
weather forecasting.
   The so-called ``price-performance'' measure of the new
computers, which compares the price with the machines' processing
power, is 15 percent to 25 percent greater than the models they
replace, said Rick Martin, an analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   IBM said the System-390 represents the first generational change
in its mainframes in which owners of most existing machines can
easily upgrade to the new line.
   The two high-end models of the new line won't be available until
the third quarter of 1991, IBM said. That could provoke some
customers who need that level of power to consider competing
machines, analysts said.
   IBM said the delay was due to normal testing procedures on the
advanced processors that will drive the new high-end models.
   The processors in the models that are available immediately or
in coming months are based on IBM's existing high-end mainframes,
the 3090 series, said Carl J. Conti, the IBM senior vice president
in charge of mainframes.
   Conti said he expected customers who need the power of the new
high-end machines will buy the models that are available, then
upgrade the computers with the new processors.
   IBM has come under increasing pressure in recent years from
makers of IBM-compatible mainframes, principally Fujitsu, Hitachi
Data Systems Corp. and Amdahl Corp.
   Amdahl is 45 percent owned by Fujitsu, while Hitachi Data
Systems is partially owned by Hitachi of Japan.
   These three companies often undercut IBM's prices, and their
share of the mainframe market has been growing as IBM's has slipped.
   However, IBM still holds about 87 percent of the U.S. high-end
mainframe market, says Computer Intelligence, a La Jolla, Calif.,
research firm.
   Because Wednesday' announcement had been expected, the stock
market reaction was muted. IBM shares finished off 12{ cents for
the day at $102.37{.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Chairman to Seek Subpoenas For Good, Walters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee chairman said Wednesday he
will ask that two former Denver developers be subpoenaed to answer
questions about their finances and failed Silverado Banking,
Savings and Loan.
   Kenneth Good and Bill Walters defaulted on $132 million in loans
from the former Denver thrift. They had been scheduled to appear
Thursday before the House Banking Committee's subcommittee on
financial institutions supervision, regulation and insurance.
   Members of Congress want the two to explain how they can
maintain affluent lifestyles after claiming in earlier
congressional testimony to have a ``negative net worth.''
   This week, Good and Walters both refused to appear before the
financial institutions subcommittee, so it cancelled the hearing.
   Subcommittee chairman Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., said
Wednesday in a statement from his Washington office that he will
seek a subpoena to force the two to testify.
   ``I am appalled by their actions,'' Annunzio said. ``Originally,
they said they would testify voluntarily and I took their word in
good faith. Now, at the last minute they say they will not attend.
They falsely led the subcommittee to believe they would be in
Washington on Thursday.
   ``I will not be deterred,'' he said. ``I will ask for a subpoena
to compel them to testify.''
   Good and Walters are two key figures in the investigation of
Silverado's demise. Both invested in Silverado board member Neil
Bush's Denver oil company and then Bush, as a board member of the
thrift, voted in favor of big loans for the two. Good and Walters
subsequently defaulted on the loans.
   Federal regulators closed Silverado in December 1988. The thrift
failure is expected to cost taxpayers up to $1 billion.
   Walters and Good have both said they are broke and cannot repay
the loans they obtained from Silverado. But officials were
concerned about evidence to the contrary that surfaced in recent
months.
   Walters, through a trust benefiting his wife, owns a $1.9
million home in Newport Beach, Calif.; a $1 million Palm Springs,
Calif. home; and expensive cars and memberships in exclusive
country clubs across the country.
   Good has a $700,000 home in Tampa, Fla., and a New York
condominium. Good also stands to recover a $1.5 million Eagle-Vail
golf course home he once owned.
   Annunzio said George Manning, Walters' attorney, reported that
his client's life had been disrupted by his requested appearance
before the subcommittee and that he would only appear if the panel
met in a closed session.
   ``The American people have the right to hear everything
involving the savings and loan scandal, and I will not be a party
to any closed meetings to hear testimony from those who are
responsible for this multi-billion scandal,'' Annunzio said.
   Gil Thurm, Good's lawyer in Washington, said Good could not
attend the hearing because of a scheduling conflict.

<HEAD>Economists Tell Congress of Dangers, Benefits of Foreign
Investment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three economists told Congress Wednesday that
foreign investment in the United States can be good, but must be
closely watched by the government.
   The danger, they said, is predatory investment by foreign
companies that buy their American competitors and shut them down.
   They also said business practices of other nations can conflict
with American philosophies _ even to the point of running against
U.S. law.
   ``We must reject the assertion that corporate nationality does
not matter,'' said Steven Cohen, director of the Berkeley
Roundtable on the International Economy at the University of
California.
   For example, ``Japan's behavior is determined by rules that are
very different from the United States,'' said Clyde Prestowitz,
director of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington.
   ``Most traditional business practices of Japan are contrary to
anti-trust laws,'' he said.
   Prestowitz, Cohen and Robert Reich of Harvard University
expressed their views to a congressional panel studying the
government's role in a world economy dominated by multi-national
corporations.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the Joint Economic
Committee, asked the economists if a federal law should be passed
limiting government subsidies to American-owned companies.
   Cohen said the ownership of the firm wasn't as important as its
behavior in the United States. For example, a foreign-owned company
that is creating employment, bringing in new technology and
developing technology in the United States is benefiting this
country, he said.
   Problems occur when foreign ownership starts changing the
politics of the United States, the economists warned.
   Reich criticized the government's enforcement of anti-trust
laws. He said lack of enforcement has caused monopolistic and
predatory practices.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday
approved the sale of a French-owned chemical plant in Thorofare,
N.J., to a Dutch-owned firm to avoid potential price-fixing in the
vinyl manufacturing industry.
   Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine of Paris will sell the plant to
Ausimont U.S.A., Inc., for an undisclosed price, said Daniel Ducore
of the FTC's Bureau of Competition.
   Atochem Inc., an Elf subsidiary in Glen Rock, N.J., last year
acquired the Thorofare plant as part of a $1 billion purchase of
Philadelphia-based Pennwalt Corp., Ducore said.
   After receiving a complaint, the commission became concerned
that Elf's acquisition could reduce competition in the production
and sale of two chemicals used to make vinyl-type plastics like
wire insulation, Ducore said.
   ``To settle the commission concern, they agreed they'd sell off
the Thorofare plant,'' he said.
   Ausimont, based in Morristown, N.J., is a subsidiary of Ausimont
NV of the Netherlands.

<TEXT>
   In apparently the first reversal of its kind
for the Office of Thrift Supervision, a federal judge ruled
Wednesday that the government must return control of the state's
largest thrift to its management.
   U.S. District Judge Dale Saffels ordered the federal OTS to
release the Franklin Savings Association from receivership by 10
a.m. Thursday. Saffels said decision to place Franklin under
control of the federal Resolution Trust Corp. in February was
``arbitrary and capricious.''
   Further, Saffels found the OTS decision ``lacked any basis in
fact.''
   Saffels also retained jurisdiction in the case for the next 90
days, meaning the OTS cannot appoint another conservator or attempt
to place Franklin in receivership during that time without his
approval.
   Saffels told reporters that after 90 days, the OTS could move
against Franklin again. That could mean more court hearings, he
said.
   ``And we'd probably start over again,'' he said.
   In Washington, OTS spokesman William Fulwider said he believes
it is the first time a court has returned control of an S&amp;L from
the agency to private management. The OTS was set up about a year
ago as part of the savings and loan bailout legislation.
   Harris Weinstein, chief counsel of the OTS, said in a statement
that the thrift agency regretted Saffels' decision.
   ``We firmly believe the government acted in a timely and proper
manner in taking over Franklin, an institution that was being
operated with insufficient capital and in an unsafe and unsound
manner,'' said the statement released in Washington.
   ``OTS continues to believe that the takeover of Franklin was
fully justified and in the best interests of taxpayers, the
(deposit) insurance fund and the institution's depositors.''
   Weinstein's statement said the OTS plans to appeal the decision
``vigorously.'' He said the agency will ask the District Court to
stay its order while the appeal is pending.
   If that motion is denied, the OTS will immediately seek a stay
from the federal court of appeals in Denver, Weinstein said.

   T. Boone Pickens is taking his battle against a
Japanese auto parts manufacturer to U.S. newspapers Thursday with a
advertising campaign proclaiming ``America, You Lost the Economic
War.''
   In full-page ads appearing in the New York Times and Washington
Post, Pickens says his fight with Koito Manufacturing Co. Ltd. is
an example of how Japan is closed to foreign investors.
   The ads also claim the Japanese economy is being protected by
the U.S. military in the Middle East and providing little in return.
   With 26 percent, Pickens is the largest shareholder of Koito but
has been rejected in repeated attempts to gain seats on the board
of directors. Koito claims Pickens is a stalking horse for another
Japanese corporate raider.
   Pickens accuses Toyota Motor Co., Koito's largest customer and
second largest shareholder, of controlling Koito and blocking him
in order to keep hidden its amount of control.
   ``The Japanese refuse to play on a level playing field, causing
the loss of American jobs and a growing U.S. trade imbalance,'' the
ads say. ``Now Japan is even refusing to fully support America's
military efforts in the Middle East where Japan gets all of its oil
to fuel its economic machine.''
   ``Japan's cartels are taking us to the cleaners, and laughing
all the way to the bank,'' Pickens said. ``Now they are evening
doing it under the protection of our aircraft in the Middle East.
   Earlier this week, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu announced an aid
package of $1 billion for the U.S.-led force arrayed against Iraq
and further assistance for Middle East countries hurt by the
embargo on Baghdad.
   The government also asked the country's private industry to help
support the multinational force in the Persian Gulf by providing
jeeps, car-carrying ships and other products and services.
   Readers are asked to write President Bush, Trade Representative
Carla Hills, Japanese U.S. Ambassador Ryohei Murata and others to
complain about ``Toyota and other Japanese cartels taking advantage
of America's fairness.''
   Pickens plans to spend several hundred thousand dollars on the
campaign, said associate Andrew Littlefair. The ads will also
appear later in USA Today, plus large regional newspapers and
special interest magazines.
   The ads also repeat taunts such as ``Yankee go home'' and
``Remember Pearl Harbor'' Pickens heard at Koito's annual meeting
earlier this summer.
   ``I think (the ad) appears to be blatant Japan-bashing,'' said
Koito spokesman Richard Wolf. ``And I think it is attempting to
appeal to the lowest common denominator and I don't think that tack
is going to be successful.''
   ``What the ads are designed to do is camouflage the fact that he
is pursuing his own personal financial agenda, and that is to
obtain a greenmail payment for Koito stock that he is stuck with,''
Wolf said.

   The United States wants its allies to
pay the entire cost of its military buildup in the Persian Gulf, an
estimated $1 billion a month, senior administration officials said
Wednesday.
   The officials provided some of the first specific figures on
what President Bush had in mind when he called last week for
America's allies to pay their fair share of the campaign against
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Bush directed two of his closest Cabinet aides, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, on
global fund-raising missions.
   Baker was scheduled to tour the oil-rich capitals of the Middle
East while Brady was in the middle of a whirlwind tour of four
capitals in four days.
   After meetings with French officials and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, Brady's delegation made a refueling stop in
Anchorage before flying on to meetings Friday with South Korean
President Roh Tae-woo and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   In London, Baker pronounced Mrs. Thatcher ``enormously
supportive.'' Aides said she promised detailed figures soon.
   The secretary also said his French visit was a success.
   The senior administration officials, briefing reporters on
condition that they not be named, said that Brady's mission was
focusing on two types of assistance.
   One is emergency aid for countries especially hard hit by the
trade embargo against Iraq and the other is cash and contributions
to defray the costs incurred by the United States in its big
buildup of troops and ships in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf.
   The officials put the total cost of the buildup at $6 billion
through the end of 1990 and estimated it would average $1 billion a
month after that.
   A request to allies to meet the entire U.S. cost is reasonable,
one official said, because ``they couldn't buy this (military)
capability anywhere else in the world.''
   The officials indicated that the administration hoped for many
contributions such as oil, air and sea transportation and medical
supplies, in part to blunt the criticism that cash donations
effectively turn the U.S. military into a mercenary force.
   One official said the worldwide search for donations was linked
in part to the U.S. budget deficit.
   Brady told reporters traveling aboard his plane Wednesday that
the administration remained opposed to any efforts to reduce the
targets for deficit reduction next year.
   He said the president strongly favored reducing the deficit,
projected at $231 billion for the 12 months beginning Oct. 1, by
$50 billion next year and reducing cumulative deficits by $500
billion over five years.
   Egypt, Jordan and Turkey would be the principal candidates for
trade asssistance, estimated as needing $3.5 billion through the
end of this year and another $7 billion next year.
   The officials said that the conversations with Thatcher and the
French centered primarily on this issue and involved a dicusssion
of a possible $3 billion in aid that the 12-nation European
Community was scheduled to take up Friday at a meeting of European
finance ministers in Rome.
   In addition to aid to the so-called front line states of Egypt,
Turkey and Jordan and the military payments to the United States,
the administration also wants to raise an unspecified amount to be
used to alleviate economic damage from rising oil prices in
countries such as the Philippines, Brazil and the emerging
democracies of Eastern Europe.
   The officials would not discuss an overall price tag but the
various elements could well add up to more than $25 billion.
   The Paris and London stopovers were seen as a way for the United
States to gain endorsements for Bush's call for burden-sharing
before the administration solicits Japan and West Germany, two
economic superpowers who have been accused, especially by many
members of Congress, of not doing enough so far in the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   The officials on Brady's plane said that Japan's pledge of $1
billion in aid was a good beginning but they did not dispute
reports that the administration will press for more.
   One officials said that Taiwan, a country that is not on the
travel agenda of either Brady or Baker, would be approached by a
third-party emissary and asked for support. Because of diplomatic
relations with mainland China, the United States is limited in the
types of official contact it can have with Taiwan.
   Before leaving London, Brady rejected a suggestion that foreign
leaders might resent being leaned on by the United States for
economic help.
   ``Quite the contrary, Mrs. Thatcher thought it was exactly the
right thing to do,'' Brady said.

   A federal judge Wednesday refused to stop Home
Box Office Inc. from showing films containing songs copyrighted by
Broadcast Music Inc., in a licensing dispute involving nearly all
of HBO's programming schedule.
   But U.S. District Judge John Sprizzo ordered HBO to pay BMI an
interim fee for broadcasting films containing songs by BMI
composers. BMI sued HBO in January as HBO's license was about to
expire and the two sides couldn't agree on a new fee.
   The broad licensing dispute, which involves several lawsuits,
focuses on who and how much should be paid to music syndicates for
the songs heard during movies.
   Sprizzo refused to slap an injunction on HBO that would have
prevented the pay-television service from showing about 80 movies
on its September schedule that contain BMI songs, including
``Batman.''
   Since its license expired Jan. 1, HBO has continued to broadcast
such films without paying a fee.
   ``We would have no schedule without BMI music,'' HBO general
counsel John Redpath Jr. said. ``And without a schedule we don't
have a business.''
   BMI attorney Robert Sisk could not be reached for comment.
   The lawsuit was filed amid efforts by BMI to boost its cable
television levies. Beyond raising basic rates, BMI wants to collect
from local cable systems as well as from cable programmers. It now
charges just programmers. That aspect of the case still is in
litigation, Redpath said.
   BMI represents more than 100,000 composers and publishers of
more than 1.5 million songs, collecting a contracted fee whenever
one of its songs is played. It licenses radio and television
stations, hotel and restaurant chains, even discotheques.
   HBO, owned by Time Warner Inc., has more than 23 million
subscribers, making it the largest pay-television service in the
nation.
   Redpath said HBO has paid for music rights for more than a
decade and was willing to negotiate a new fee. He said Sprizzo
suggested HBO pay BMI 15 cents per subscriber, which Redpath called
too high. Redpath said the two sides would negotiate.
   HBO's fees amounted to about 27 cents per subscriber to BMI and
the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, which
has about 45,000 members.
   BMI demanded a split license from HBO in which the cable service
would buy performance rights for programs only until they are
transmitted to the local oeprator. The operator, which transmits to
the home viewer, would have to negotiate licenses separately.
   BMI has named Manhattan Cable Television Inc., a local operator
and a unit of Time Warner, in the same lawsuit. HBO contends that
split licenses violate antitrust laws, and says local operators
with dozens of channels would be hard-pressed to negotiate
individual licenses for each program.
   BMI lawyers have maintained that HBO has not proven that
operators cannot negotiate individual licenses.

   Richard T. Schlosberg III, the Los Angeles
Times' president since 1988, has been appointed Times Mirror Corp.
group vice president for newspapers. He'll run the media company's
Eastern dailies.
   Schlosberg, 46, had been responsible for circulation,
advertising, production, operations and other business functions at
the Times. The newspaper this year became the nation's largest
metropolitan daily, with a circulation of more than 1.2 million
daily and 1.5 million Sunday. His appointment was nnounced Tuesday.
   In addition to the flagship Los Angeles Times, Times Mirror
publishes Newsday on New York's Long Island, New York Newsday, the
Baltimore Sun newspapers, The Hartford (Conn.) Courant, The
(Allentown, Pa.) Morning Call, The (Stamford, Conn.) Advocate and
Greenwich (Conn.) Time.
   On Wednesday, Newsday and New York Newsday announced that
Douglas B. Fox, senior vice president for marketing, had been
appointed president and chief operating officer.
   Fox, who joined Newsday in 1987 as a vice president of
marketing, will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the
newspaper, Publisher and Chief Executive Officer Robert M. Johnson
said.
   The appointment ``will allow me to concentrate more on broad
issues of policy, strategy, employee concerns and outside community
relations,'' Johnson said.
   Advertising revenue at Times Mirror's eastern papers has fallen
sharply this year, largely because of the weak Northeastern
economy, Times Mirror Chief Executive Robert F. Erburu said July
24. He said that was a major reason that Times Mirror's first-half
profits dropped 40 percent, to $93 million.
   Times Mirror also announced that the duties of Donald F. Wright,
senior vice president, will be expanded to include supervision of
budget and planning processes, public policy issues and multimedia
efforts. He currently is responsible for the company's broadcast
and cable-television groups.
   ``These changes will enhance Times Mirror's management strength
at a critical time to meet the ongoing challenges of the media
environment of the '90s,'' Erburu said in a statement.
   In announcing Schlosberg's appointment, Times Mirror said it was
too early to say when or whether he will be replaced as president
of the Times.
   Schlosberg will assume his new duties by the end of September,
when he also will become chairman of Times Mirror's newspaper
management committee.
   Schlosberg joined Times Mirror in 1983. He served as publisher
and chief executive of the Denver Post for four years. Then he
moved to the Los Angeles Times. From 1980 to 1983, he was senior
vice president of Harte-Hanks Communications and president of
Harte-Hanks' newspaper operations.

<HEAD>FTC Says ABC-CFA Television Contracts Are Anti-Competitive</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Updates with ABC comment, details of contracts, other
information; A version also moving on sports wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission filed an
administrative complaint against the College Football Association
and Capital Cities-ABC Inc. on Wednesday, saying their national
television contracts are anti-competitive.
   The five-page complaint, a copy of which was obtained by The
Associated Press, said competition among schools and networks for
college football games has been hindered and that ``consumers have
been deprived of the selection of college football games that would
otherwise have been televised in a competitive environment.''
   The FTC asked that the CFA and Cap Cities appear before an
administrative law judge on Nov. 13 in Washington. The FTC could
void the national television contracts and prohibit the CFA from
negotiating new deals for all its members.
   ABC currently televises games under a contract with the Big Ten
and Pacific-10 conferences. The CFA's $64 million four-year
contract with CBS expires after this season and it is scheduled to
begin a $210 million, five-year deal with ABC in 1991.
   In addition, the CFA has a deal with ESPN that expires after
this season and a $125 million, five-year renewal with ESPN that
begins in 1991. Cap Cities owns 80 percent of ESPN and the other 20
percent is owned by RJR Nabisco Inc.
   The CFA is comprised of 64 schools from all major conferences
except the Big Ten and Pac-10. The association announced the filing
of the complaint at its Boulder, Colo., office after Lew Engman,
its Washington lawyer, received the papers.
   ``We are disappointed that the FTC has decided to file a
complaint against the CFA,'' the association said in a statement.
``Such action, however, should not be construed as a finding that
the CFA has acted unlawfully, but rather as an initiation of the
formal hearing process.''
   ABC Sports spokesman Mark Mandel said the network did not have a
comment since it had not yet seen the complaint.
   Engman said the FTC did not take the more drastic step of going
to federal district court for an injunction against the contracts.
Mary L. Azcuenaga, one of the commissioners, dissented from the
complaint. Another commissioner, Deborah K. Owen, dissented in part.
   After the administrative law judge makes his ruling, either side
can appeal to the five commissioners of the FTC. If the full
commission rules against the CFA, the association can appeal to the
U.S. Court of Appeals.
   The FTC scheduled a news conference for Thursday to discuss the
complaint. The papers say that, ``Competition among schools in the
marketing of college football telecasts has been hindered,
restrained, foreclosed and frustrated; and competition among
telecasters of college football games has been hindered,
restrained, foreclosed and frustrated.''
   The FTC said these acts ``constitute unfair methods of
competition in or affecting commerce.''
   The CFA began marketing football games in 1984. In June of that
year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the NCAA violated antitrust
law by selling national TV contracts.

<HEAD>U.S. Dollar Declines, Share Prices Inch Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar approached its lowest opening level in
almost a year against the Japanese yen Thursday, while share prices
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange inched up.
   The dollar opened at 141.48 yen, down 0.82 yen from its
Wednesday close. The dollar was quoted at 141.65 yen, late during
New York's Wednesday session.
   The dollar opened at 140.97 yen on Oct. 19, 1989.
   A trader with Fuji Bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the lower opening was in part due to a rumor that life
insurance companies had sold dollars in Sydney, prior to the
opening of the Tokyo market.
   Buy orders for the dollar appeared on the Tokyo market shortly
after it opened, he said.
   ``Dealers are adjusting positions ahead of possible credit
easing (by the U.S. Federal Reserve) and employment statistics due
to come out'' Friday, he said.
   Many economists say the U.S. economy is headed into a recession
and the Fed will move to lower interest rates to spark economic
activity.
   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to foreign investors.
   In stock trading, the closely watched Nikkei Stock Average of
225 selected issues rose 32.30 points, or 0.13 percent, in the
first 30 minutes of trading. On Wednesday the index fell 829.30
points.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bond declined to 82.62 points, from 82.76 Wednesday. Its yield was
8.210 percent, up from 8.180 percent.

<HEAD>Chicago Merc Tightens Stock-Index Circuit Breaker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said Wednesday it
wants to tighten up the so-called ``circuit breakers'' in its
stock-index futures market in a further attempt to prevent a
runaway stock-market collapse.
   The Merc said it had applied to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission to reduce the maximum daily price limit for Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index futures to 20 points from 30 points.
   The new limit would be equivalent to about 150 points on the Dow
Jones industrial average. The current limit of 30 points is equal
to more than 250 Dow points.
   The Merc's board of governors approved the lower limit after
studying the workings of circuit breakers during recent periods of
extreme market volatility that occurred during the week after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in early August.
   ``On the whole, the circuit breakers have been given high marks
and have been cited as having a stabilizing effect on the market,''
the exchange said in a statement.
   ``After consultations with futures and securities industry
market participants, the board concluded it would be beneficial to
further reduce the maximum daily price limit for S&amp;P futures,'' the
Merc said.
   S&amp;P 500 futures are the most widely traded stock-index futures,
which are contracts to buy and sell baskets of stocks. The
contracts enable investors to hedge against stock-market losses or
speculate on stock prices without actually owning stocks.
   Some critics contend computer-driven trading strategies
involving huge blocks of stocks and futures can cause violent price
swings in the stock market. Limits on the price movement of the
futures contracts are intended to act as brakes on a runaway stock
market.
