   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
opened a new round of talks with allied leaders Sunday night on
reducing U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe.
   But his chances of shaping a NATO consensus on how to reply to
the latest proposal by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev were
limited by the absence of a consensus within the Bush
administration.
   U.S. sources, who demanded anonymity, said the Pentagon had not
``signed off'' on a U.S. response. It was not clear whether the
delay was caused by a substantive disagreement or by the fact that
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was away, starting a two-week trip to
Asia.
   A senior Defense Department official traveling with Cheney said
he heard a hint of such a story last week and that it wasn't his
sense that the Pentagon is throwing up any kind of roadblocks.
   ``I have no sense we are the problem,'' the official said. He
said Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs,
had been in constant contact with the Pentagon's representative at
the talks, Undersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, and ``I didn't
sense there were any problems.''
   Reflecting the lack of a firm U.S. position, officials said
afterward that Baker was ``neutral'' in his presentation to the
allies of the Gorbachev proposal.
   ``He basically just laid it (the proposal) out literally,'' said
a U.S. official, who demanded anonymity. ``The secretary described
it in neutral terms.''
   As for the allies, the official said, ``The ministers felt they
wanted to consider it for a longer period of time.''
   Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that Baker told Soviet
officials last week that the United States is now willing to
receive preliminary Soviet proposals about reductions in nuclear
arms that would go beyond those currently under negotiation.
   ``Up to now we have not been willing to discuss the Soviet ideas
on Start II on the ground that we still have work to do on Start
1,'' the paper quoted a senior administration official. ``Now we
are saying you can raise your ideas if you want to. We are getting
to the point where we need to think a little bit about the next
phase.''
   Also on the agenda in Ottawa was talks on German reunification.
   The first session was requested by West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher to brief Baker on meetings Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and Genscher held in Moscow with leaders of the Soviet Union.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and French Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas were invited to attend.
   Afterward, Baker and the foreign ministers of the 15 U.S. allies
in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization arranged a caucus in
advance of the opening Monday of an ``Open Skies'' conference with
the Soviet Union and the six other Warsaw Pact nations.
   The purpose is to consider adoption of a proposal made last May
by President Bush to open the countries to aerial surveillance as a
way of allaying suspicions of secret military operations or
preparations for surprise attacks.
   In his State of the Union speech Jan. 31, Bush proposed a
ceiling of 225,000 on U.S. and Soviet troops on foreign soil in
Europe, with a limit of 195,000 in Central Europe.
   Gorbachev, in a four-hour meeting with Baker on Friday in
Moscow, countered with an initiative that would set the ceiling of
195,000 throughout Europe _ or 225,000 as an alternative _ without
any sub-limit for Central Europe.
   One result would be more leeway for the Soviets to keep troops
in Central Europe than under the Bush proposal. Currently, about
385,000 are in East Germany alone.
   Baker called Gorbachev's proposal ``very interesting,'' but said
at a news conference Friday night in Moscow the Bush administration
could not reply without consulting the allies.
   Still, discussion within the Bush administration itself
apparently is still going on. The Pentagon and the National
Security Council must weigh in with their recommendations.
   Within the alliance itself the debate could extend beyond the
two days Baker is spending in Ottawa. So a consensus may not emerge
by the time he flies home Tuesday night.
   Genscher requested the meeting with Baker as Baker's U.S. Air
Force jet was en route from Bucharest on a 12-hour, 5,290-mile
flight.
   Gale winds in the vicinity of Shannon, Ireland, where Baker's
plane was due to refuel, forced it to divert to Lajes Air Base in
the Azores. to Canada.
   German reunification is proceeding at a pace unanticipated by
either the Americans or the Soviets. The two superpowers are trying
to arrange a peaceful outcome, but they differ on strategy.
   Baker has endorsed a proposal that would keep the unified
Germany in NATO, but without Western troops permitted in East
Germany.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze has proposed an
international plebiscite on the question of German reunification.

<HEAD>Acid Rain Conference to Showcase 10-Year Study</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists from around the globe gather
in South Carolina on Monday to review a 10-year study of acid rain
that may be the most comprehensive ever on the issue.
   About 1,000 researchers from 11 federal agencies spent $500
million compiling 28 separate reports on the causes and effects of
acid rain and proposals to curb it.
   One conclusion of the study likely to provoke controversy at the
conference is that acid rain generally isn't harming the nation's
forests, said Joseph Barnard, a U.S. Forest Service researcher, who
headed up the work of forest scientists, The Charlotte, (N.C.)
Observer said in Saturday editions.
   The World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental
group, said ``evidence is unambiguous'' that acid rain and ozone
contribute to the deaths of trees in the South, East and West.
   The reports will be reviewed during the weeklong meeting on
Hilton Head Island, then combined in a final document that will be
used with computer models to devise emission-control strategies
against acid rain.
   ``The whole purpose is to give outsiders a chance to critique
the reports. It's a chance to get them out into the broader
scientific community,'' said Chuck Herrick, a spokesman for the
National Acidic Rain Assessment Program.
   The program was established by Congress 10 years ago to oversee
the study of acid rain.
   About 600 scientists from 35 countries are expected to attend
the conference, which runs through Friday.
   Acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
which mixes in the atmosphere and can be carried hundreds of miles
before falling back to earth as rain, snow, fog and dust particles.
   It makes lakes and streams acidic, killing aquatic life. It can
also kill trees and is harmful to the health of humans.
   Much of the pollution comes from power plants that burn
high-sulphur coal, although other industrial facilities contribute.
   The National Acidic Rain Assessment Program's final report will
be used to create 30 scenarios detailing the expected effects of
acid rain in the future, and the effectiveness of various efforts
to curtail acid rain.
   The report will make no recommendations on what should be done,
however.
   ``The assumption then is the policy people will be looking at
this and will be able to make their decisions,'' said Herrick,
adding that the review is probably the most comprehensive ever
compiled on acid rain.
   Last summer, President Bush unveiled a clean air bill to sharply
reduce urban smog, toxic chemical air pollution and acid rain by
the end of the decade. Bush's plan, which he called one of his top
priorities, is before Congress.

Richard Neely said Sunday he has settled his lawsuit against Trans
World Airlines for $12,500.
   Neely filed the lawsuit in Kanawha County Circuit Court after a
July flight from Seattle to New York, alleging that TWA officials
handled a luggage delay poorly.
   According to the lawsuit, Neely was shoved by a female employee
while he was acting as an informal liaison for the approximately
150 passengers on his flight who were waiting for their luggage.
   Neely called the settlement satisfactory and said it involved no
disciplinary action against any TWA workers involved.
   Phone calls to Don Morrison, TWA's director of public relations

   Six convicts, including three murderers,
escaped from a maximum-security prison early Sunday, apparently by
cutting through metal bars, officials said. One was captured later
in the day.
   The escapees, who had been in segregation cells at the Joliet
Correctional Center because of disciplinary problems, were
considered extremely dangerous, authorities said. Most were in
their 20s.
   Tommy Munoz was captured shortly after 5:30 p.m. at his cousin's
Chicago home by law enforcement officers who'd staked it out, said
state Department of Corrections spokesman Nic Howell. Munoz, 22,
was serving a sentence for narcotics violatins and intimidation.
   About 100 corrections officers specially trained to deal with
escapes assisted state police and local law enforcement officers in
the hunt.
   A search for the escapees with dogs and an airplane was called
off earlier because they has apparently split up, said state
Trooper Thomas Miller.
   The prisoners escaped from segregation cells, where they were
kept for disciplinary problems, Howell said. Four of the inmates
were doubled up in cells and the other two were in cells alone.
   Reports of when the prisoners escaped changed over the course o
the day. State police originally reported the men were discovered
missing at 4:55 a.m., but Illinois Department of Corrections
spokesman Nic Howell later said the discovery was made after a 7
a.m. inmate count came up short.
   The inmates had to cut through bars on the cells, break a
window, cut through bars outside the window and cross a fence to
get away, Howell said.
   ``Obviously, this is a breach of security,'' he said. ``They
shouldn't have had the materials to be able to cut with and should
not have been able to cut like this without being noticed.''
   The men may have been armed with cutting tools when they got
away, Miller said.
   The prison, which has been plagued by overcrowding in recent
years, is one of the state's four maximum-security facilities and
one of two in Joliet, which is about 30 miles southwest of Chicago.
The other in Joliet is Stateville Correctional Center.
   The prison houses 1,300 inmates, 500 more than it was built to
hold.
   In addition to Munoz, Miller identified the escapees as:
   _Daniel Johnson, 24, of Buru, Tenn., imprisoned for murder.
   _James F. Allen, 40, of Chicago, imprisoned for three murders.
   _Dave Rodriguez, 21, of Chicago, imprisoned for murder.
   _Terry W. Colburn, 21, of Bloomington, Ill., imprisoned for
burglary.
   _Ronald Roach, in his 20s, of Wyoming, Ill., imprisoned for
burglary.

   Police hunting the killers who shot
three children and an adult to death and wounded three other people
at a bowling alley said Sunday they plan to share composite
drawings of two men with Mexican authorities.
   ``We have information right now there may be a possible
individual from Mexico who has done something like this,'' said
police Capt. Fred Rubio. Las Cruces is 45 miles north of the
Mexican border.
   Within an hour of the shootings Saturday morning, police set up
10 roadblocks around Las Cruces, but no arrests resulted and the
barriers were taken down by evening, Rubio said.
   Teams of officers were checking out about 100 pieces of
information telephoned to Las Cruces police from other law
enforcement agencies and the public, he said.
   ``Most of the leads we have followed and looked into have not
panned out,'' he said.
   Police said two men walked into the Las Cruces Bowl on Saturday,
herded seven people, including four children, into an office in the
front of the building; made them lie on the floor and shot them in
the backs of their heads. The men then set fire to the office in an
effort to cover up the crime, police said.
   ``The owner's daughter had opened the safe and was counting the
money when all this happened,'' said police Sgt. Phil George.
   Rubio said it appeared the motive was robbery and that money was
missing. He did not disclose the amount.
   He said the seven victims were the only people in the bowling
alley at the time and the robbers apparently ``decided to rid
themselves of any witnesses.''
   No neighbors interviewed Saturday heard the shots, but they said
their dogs started barking around 7:30 a.m.
   One of the victims called police around 8:30 a.m. from the
smoldering office.
   ``She was crying and hysterical when she called,'' said George,
who was the first officer on the scene.
   ``I've never been involved in a case so gruesome,'' George said.
``One of the survivors was moaning and groaning, so I went to her
and we started getting them out of the office.''
   Firefighters helped move the dead and wounded from the flames.
   Authorities said junior league games for youngsters had been
scheduled to start at 9 a.m.
   ``If there had been any more people, I'm sure they would have
been shot,'' Rubio said.
   Helicopters and planes from the U.S. Customs Service, Army and
Border Patrol assisted in the search for the two men reported by
witnesses to be driving a tan or green van or utility vehicle.
   The bowling alley, which also has a restaurant and bar, video
games and pinball machines, is in a mixed commercial and
residential area in this city of 55,000 people. The building is on
a corner of an intersection with a large parking lot around it and
a vacant lot on one side.
   The wounded _ two adults and a 12-year-old _ originally were in
critical condition at Memorial General Hospital, but two of the
victims' conditions were upgraded Sunday afternoon to serious and
the third was listed in good condition, police said. Police would
not release any other details.
   Police Lt. Jerry Fariss said Sunday he had spoken with two of
the survivors. ``One of them was able to give a description that
tends to match the one we've got,'' he said.
   Rubio said shooting children so young ``doesn't make any damn
sense. These people are just coldblooded people.''
   ``It's not the city it was when I used to roam the streets,'' he
said. There were two homicides in Las Cruces in all of 1989 and six
so far this year, according to Rubio.
   ``Everybody's in shock around here. I told my husband I want to
move from here,'' said neighbor Bobbi Avalos. ``I don't think I
could ever go in there (bowling alley) again.''
   The dead were identified as bowling alley employee Steve Teran,
26, daughter Valerie Teran, 2, stepdaughter Paula Holguin, 6, and
Amy Houser, 13.
   Teran's cousin, Larry Alvarez, said Audrey Teran, Steve's wife
and the mother of Valerie and Paula, was at work elsewhere at the
time of the shootings.
   ``She's back home with her mother,'' Alvarez said Sunday. ``They
took her back home (to Silver City) last night.''
   Alvarez said Teran, also of Silver City in southwest New Mexico,
had worked at the bowling alley two years and did a variety of jobs.
   ``There is a desperate need for justice here,'' Alvarez said.
``I don't see how anybody can shoot children.''

<TEXT>
   A general claimed Saturday the
government has made strong military gains toward vanquishing the
U.S.-backed guerrillas in the nearly one year since the Soviet
troop withdrawal.
   Lt. Gen. Abdul Haq Ulumi also claimed guerrilla losses were 10
times those of the army in the past year. He declined to give a
specific figure.
   The insurgents, who are based in neighboring Pakistan, said the
only route to peace is on the battlefield, not across the
negotiating table.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III told reporters in
Moscow that Washington was willing to permit Afghan President Najib
to remain in office while peace talks are conducted between the
Soviet-backed government and the U.S.-armed insurgents.
   Referring to reports that Moscow and Washington were considering
compromises that could include a scaling down of aid to the
opposing Afghan sides, Ulumi said it was ``very much toon too early
to speak about what we should give up and what they (the
guerrillas) should give up.''
   First there should be a cease-fire, international guarantees,
elections and formation of a broad-based government, said Ulumi, a
ranking member of the Central Committee of the People's Democratic
Party of Afghanistan.
   Speaking to foreign journalists through an interpreter, he said
that since the Soviets ended nine years of military presence in
mid-February, Najib's troops proved their ability to go it alone
against the insurgents, known as the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy
warriors.
   The government still holds every major city and has made deals
with scores of local commanders who once fought on behalf of the
mujahedeen. But fighting continues in much of the countryside and
around several key provincial capitals. Mujahedeen rockets still
fall on Kabul, although with far less frequnecy than a year ao.
   The last Red Army troops crossed the border home on Feb. 15,
1989, but Moscow continues massive supplies, by land and air, of
weapons and food.

   Galileo's camera shutter snapped
uncontrollably for five hours Saturday after the spacecraft zipped
around Venus, but officials said it shouldn't endanger the $1.35
billion, eight-year mission to Jupiter.
   Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory shut off the
television camera while diagnosing the problem, which apparently
involved faulty software that made Galileo's computer send
incorrect commands to the camera, mission director Neal Ausman said.
   They decided Saturday night to send new computer commands to
Galileo to restart the camera so it could take a series of
photographs of Venus late Saturday and early Sunday, said NASA
spokesman Bob MacMillin.
   The engineers believed an error in computer commands they sent
to Galileo made the shutter snap when it wasn't supposed to, and
they were ``pretty certain there's nothing wrong with the computer
or camera,'' he said.
   Galileo cruised around Venus at 9:59 p.m. PST Friday, coming
three to four miles closer to the planet than the planned point of
closest approach 10,028 miles above the Venusian surface, said
mission science and design manager Bill O'Neil.
   The camera appeared undamaged, but its shutter opened and closed
twice per minute 468 times over five hours, Ausman said. As
planned, only 16 pictures taken late Friday and early Saturday were
stored on Galileo's tape recorder, Ausman said.
   The malfunction didn't harm those pictures, and the 452 unwanted
shutter snappings were ``just like taking pictures with no film in
the camera,'' project manager Dick Spehalski said during a Saturday
news conference.
   However, the problem threatened five dozen other photos the
spacecraft was supposed to take in the coming week to make a
time-lapse movie of Venus' clouds and winds, said project scientist
Torrence Johnson.
   He said scientists weren't too upset because about 20 U.S. and
Soviet spacecraft have visited Venus previously, and the main
purpose of Galileo's flyby was to use Venus' gravity to speed the
spacecraft for its long trip to Jupiter.
   Galileo's other sensors will continue observing Venus as the
spacecraft speeds away from the planet, Spehalski said.
   Galileo was deployed Oct. 18 from space shuttle Atlantis on a
looping 2.4-billion, six-year route that requires Venus and Earth
to be used as gravity slingshots to hurl the spacecraft to Jupiter.
   Once there, the spacecraft will deploy a probe to study
Jupiter's atmosphere, then orbit the giant gas planet for at least
two years in a mission that costs $1.35 billion.
   When the glitch developed at 1:41 a.m. PST Saturday, Galileo
already had snapped the 16 pictures to study Venusian wind and
cloud patterns and search for lightning that might indicate
erupting volcanoes beneath the clouds.
   The camera was shut off at 6:30 a.m. after engineers determined
it was following incorrect computer commands, Ausman said. Eight
minutes later the erroneous commands stopped without explanation.
   Despite the trouble, ``there was no point when the spacecraft
was in jeopardy,'' he said.
   Galileo's TV camera is perhaps the most critical instrument on
the spacecraft. It is expected to take pictures of Jupiter 20 to
1,000 times more detailed than those returned by the Voyager 1 and
2 spacecraft in 1979.
   The TV camera has a shutter, which opens to throw light on an
electronic sensor. Data from that sensor can be sent to Earth,
where it is assembled into a photograph.
   ``We're dealing with a fresh spacecraft and prototype
software,'' so NASA knowingly risked a glitch in exchange for
trying to photograph Venus even though the spacecraft is still in
the shakedown part of its trip to Jupiter, Johnson said.
   For now, the pictures and data gathered in the flyby are being
stored on Galileo's tape recorder, and won't be sent back to Earth
until October when the spacecraft is close enough to transmit the
material. That antenna now can be used only for communications to
keep Galileo operating.
   Galileo's roundabout route to Jupiter is an indirect result of
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed
seven crew members.
   After the tragedy, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration decided against using powerful, volatile,
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets to launch spacecraft after they were
deployed from shuttles.
   Instead, Galileo was launched by a weaker booster after it was
released from Atlantis' cargo bay. That made it necessary to use
the gravity of Venus and Earth to help speed and aim Galileo toward
Jupiter. A Centaur would have propelled Galileo to Venus in only
two years.

<DATELINE>BAY MINETTE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who pleaded guilty to
manslaughter in the drownings of her three children must serve at
least one year in a treatment program for alcoholism.
   Aimee Dees of Chatom allegedly was driving drunk when her van
plunged off a rural road into Weeks Bay on March 16, 1988, drowning
her children, Kari Maxwell, 8, Morgan Cameron Maxwell, 6, and
Kristen Mallory Dees, 2.
   Mrs. Dees initially was charged with murder in the children's
drownings, but struck a plea bargain.
   Under the agreement approved by Circuit Judge Thomas B. Norton
Jr. on Friday, Mrs. Dees must serve one to three years in an
alcohol treatment program and five years of supervised probation.
   She also must pay $1,000 for each charge to the state Victims'
Compensation Fund and must serve 1,000 hours of community service
dealing with alcohol problems. In addition, she must pay court
costs and the cost of her treatment.
   If she fails to meet the requirements of the sentence, she can
be sent to prison for 15 years. The sentences were five years to be
served consecutively.
   The father of two of the children, Homer B. Maxwell III of
Atlanta, said he would prefer to see Mrs. Dees go to jail. ``She
has been in and out of drug treatment programs and has not stopped
yet,'' he said. ``She deserves to pay.''
   Maxwell has filed a civil lawsuit against Mrs. Dees in the case.
   District Attorney David Whetstone said he was pleased with the
outcome. ``Manslaughter would be the worst the jury would have
given her anyway,'' Whetstone said.
   Mrs. Dees must report to the Camel Back Vista Drug Treatment
Center in Scottsdale, Ariz., on Monday. The center is part of the
Arizona State Department of Corrections.

   The driver of a chartered Greyhound bus carrying
31 people collapsed Saturday from an apparent heart attack, but a
passenger alertly grabbed the steering wheel and safely stopped the
vehicle, authorities said.
   ``There was no warning at all,'' said Buddy Fryxell, a
52-year-old businessman from Little Rock, Ark., who grabbed the
wheel. ``The bus just started weaving, and he threw his head back.
   ``I knew things were very wrong,'' he said.
   The driver, Walter Marshall, 59, based in Grand Junction, was
later pronounced dead at University Hospital. He suffered a heart
attack at about 9:30 a.m., not long after picking up the Little
Rock Ski Club at Stapleton International Airport, officials said.
   The bus was on Interstate 70 when the driver collapsed.
   ``I thought it was going to flip, so I grabbed the wheel and got
it back into the lane,'' Fryxell said. ``I was standing up with one
foot on the brake, but he was still in the seat with his foot
lodged against the accelerator.''
   Another passenger, Don Colaianni, then pulled Marshall's leg
from the gas pedal, and Fryxell steered across three lanes and
stopped the bus.
   No passengers were injured.
   Two doctors on board the bus tried to revive Marshall, officials
said.
   ``When he was loading luggage on the bus, I noticed he was
sweating profusely,'' said one doctor, Doug Stroud. ``I asked him
if I could help, and so did others, but he said no. The exertion
probably precipitated the heart attack.''
   Greyhound sent another bus, and the club resumed its trip,
arriving in Aspen Saturday afternoon.

   Two cosmonauts rocketed into orbit Sunday on a
mission designed to turn a profit of over $40 million, a first in
the 32-year history of the Soviet space program.
   Riding a Soyuz TM-9 capsule, flight commander Anatoly Solovyov
and engineer Alexander Balandin soared into cloud-streaked skies
over the Baikonur space complex in Soviet Kazakhstan on schedule at
9:16 a.m. Moscow time.
   The launch of the three-stage rocket, shown live on Soviet
television, was also witnessed by four U.S. astronauts flown to the
space center in Central Asia for the event.
   The American guests included Dan Brandenstein, who commanded the
11-day flight of the space shuttle Columbia in January; Ron Grabe;
Paul Weitz; and Jerry Ross.
   Solovyov and Balandin were scheduled to dock later with the
space station Mir and to relieve two fellow Soviet spacemen now
spending their sixth month in orbit. The new cosmonauts are to
spend six months in space.
   All systems were reported normal by Soviet television eight
minutes after the Soyuz capsule and booster rocket lifted off atop
a column of orange-white flames.
   The cosmonauts now aboard the Mir, Alexander Viktorenko and
Alexander Serebrov, are scheduled to return to Earth on Feb. 19.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pressures have increased
on the once sacrosanct Soviet space program to prove its usefulness
to the shortage-plagued economy. Some Soviet lawmakers have even
called for funding cutbacks, saying the country can ill afford
costly space missions when it cannot supply citizens with a
reliable supply of meat and potatoes.
   The Soyuz TM-9 mission, however, is designed to to put to use
the Kristall module, described by the government newspaper Izvestia
as the first orbital factory for the full-scale manufacture of
technological and biotechnological materials in the near-weightless
conditions on Mir.
   Through use of Kristall, to be launched for linkup with Mir on
March 30, a profit of up to $41 million is expected, the official
Tass news agency said. It is the first time a profit has been part
of a manned mission in the history of the Soviet space program.

   Mount Kelud in East Java has erupted,
darkening the sky with a mammoth dust cloud and wrecking dozens of
homes, a news agency said Sunday. At least 16 people were reported
killed and more than 50 injured.
   The official Antara news agency said 15 of the deaths and 48
injuries from Saturday's eruption were in Blitar Regency. In Kediri
Regency west of the 5,679-foot peak, one person was found dead and
eight injured, the agency said.
   The eruption, which began shortly before noon, spewed volcanic
dust, sand and gravel into the air. The cloud blackened the sky
within a radius of more than 30 miles, the report said.
   In the town of Blitar, about 22 miles south of the mountain,
dust from the eruption reportedly piled up more than six inches in
some areas.
   The eruption destroyed more than 150 houses, Antara said. It
said most of those killed were caught in ruins of damaged buildings.
   It said local scientists had detected ground motion early Sunday
near the volcano and were continuing to monitor the situation.

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III offered Romania $80 million in food aid on a brief visit to
Bucharest Sunday morning, but told the country's interim leaders
that the United States expects continued movement toward democracy.
   ``We want to do our part to assist the transition to political
pluralism and a free market economy,'' Baker said after meeting
with interim President Ion Iliescu and Premier Petre Roman.
   Baker is the highest-ranking American official to visit Romania
since December's revolution which toppled Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   His visit came amid controversy over the new Provisional Council
of National Unity, which will run the country until elections on
May 20 and includes opposition parties for the first time.
   Many of the 18 party leaders who met Baker said they told him
the old National Salvation Front Council, which took power during
the revolution, has kept its grip on power in the new council.
Several said the Front is a guise for the old Communist Party.
   Baker said he told Iliescu and Roman that ``the betterment of
relations of the United States with Romania will depend on fully
free, fair elections and the respect for human rights and the
rights of minorities.''
   Terming the changes since the overthrow of Ceausescu ``a reform
movement that clearly I think we have to applaud,'' Baker told
reporters after meeting with the officials that his visit was
intended ``to encourage the continuation of the process of reform.''
   ``It's very important to the United States that the commitment
to reform towards democracy is expressed in the conduct of fully
free and fair elections,'' said Baker.
   The U.S. official announced the humanitarian aid package at a
meeting with leaders of 18 parties and four unions at the residence
of U.S. Ambassador Alan Green Jr.
   ``I was pleased, in the meeting I had with the president and the
prime minister, to say that we're prepared to make available to
Romania, on highly concessionary terms, $80 million in food
assistance,'' he said.
   A State Department official said the assistance would include
500,000 metric tons of feed grain and 7,500 tons of butter.
   Asked by reporters whether the United States would restore
Romania's favored-nation trade status, Baker said: ``We are
re-examining now our position, just as we are re-examining it with
respect to some other countries in Eastern Europe.
   ``Whether we move towards that depends on ... continued movement
towards free and fair elections, openness, freedom and democracy,''
he said.
   Baker said Romanian officials assured him ``they are committed
to fully free and fair elections.''
   Roman said after his meeting with Baker that he viewed the visit
``as the beginning of a new relationship on a new basis, taking
into account the new democracy (in Romania).''
   ``From now on we can speak of American aid as not just
humanitarian, I mean aid to rebuild,'' Roman added.
   Baker made several appearances outside the ambassador's
residence, one with ethnic Hungarian priest Laszlo Toekes by his
side. The authorities' efforts to remove Toekes from his home in
the western Romanian city of Timisoara sparked December's
revolution.
   ``Mr. Tokes, through the brave example that he set for freedom
of religion and for democracy, really served as the catalyst for
the reform effort that we see taking place in Romania,'' Baker said.
   ``We've been talking with the reverend about the importance of
respecting the rights of minorities in America and the importance
of freedom of religion.''
   Toekes said, ``The key problem in the democratization of
Romanian society is the solving of the minorities problem.''
   Some 2 million ethnic Hungarians and 220,000 ethnic Germans live
in Romania, together with some 20,000 Romanian Jews.
   Corneliu Coposu, president of the National Peasant Party, the
country's largest opposition group, said Baker asked whether the
opposition was afraid of the government and whether there was a
proper atmosphere for the elections.
   ``The collective answer was that there is fear, and it is a
sustained action of fear,'' he said.
   Baker also asked whether the opposition was happy with the May
20 election date.
   ``We told him the elections should be postponed until September
and everybody agreed,'' Coposu said.
   Radu Campeanu, president of the National Liberal Party, the
second-largest party, said there should be a distinction between
humanitarian aid and political aid.
   Political aid, he said, ``should be granted only after serious
guarantees of democracy, guarantees which don't exist today.''
   He said Baker's visit was a morale booster for the opposition,
which did not significantly change the government's position.
   Adrian Manolache, 37, president of the Romanian Ecology Party,
said the opposition told Baker that a lot of Front members were
Communist officials under Ceausescu.
   ``The Front wants to lead the country to totalitarianism,'' he
said. ``It's not possible to have democracy without opposition.''
   Asked about the impact of Baker's visit, Manolache said: ``This
visit is very important for our people, for our parties, and for
democracy because James Baker promised to us help and funds for our
electoral campaign.'' He said Baker didn't say how much help.
   ``Mr. Baker said that he is ... near the opposition and the
parties and near democracy in Romania,'' he said.
   Baker also met student leaders, representing the students who
were in the forefront of the revolution.
   Gabriel Nuta, 23, a University of Bucharest student representing
the Student League, said he told Baker to ``keep a tough position''
when it comes to the Front.
   ``They are just talking a lot about democracy, but doing very
little about it,'' he said. ``They are using Stalinist
methods.''aid.
   Baker stopped in Bucharest after a brief visit to Bulgaria
following talks in the Soviet Union. His next stop is Ottawa, where
he will attend a conference on ``open skies.''

   James ``Buster'' Douglas' knockout victory over
heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was in dispute Sunday after the
referee admitted giving a long count when Douglas was knocked down
earlier in the fight.
   The presidents of the World Boxing Council and World Boxing
Association said they would not decide on a winner until their
executive committees met later this month.
   The announcements by the WBA and WBC came seven hours after the
fight in a news conference attended by Tyson and the referee,
Octavio Meyran of Mexico.
   Douglas knocked out Tyson in the 10th round. But two rounds
earlier, Tyson had knocked down Douglas.
   Tapes show that in the eighth round the referee picked up his
count three seconds after the timekeeper's count, giving Douglas
that extra amount of time to rise.
   ``I'd like to recognize my mistake,'' Meyran said.
   Tyson, who was 37-0 with 33 knockouts going into the fight, said
he should be declared champion.
   ``I knocked him out before he knocked me out,'' Tyson said.
   Douglas did not attend the news conference, but said earlier at
his hotel suite that he got up when he heard the referee count
``eight.''
   It was not known how boxing's third major governing
organization, the International Boxing Federation, would handle the
controversial match. The IBF was not represented in Tokyo.
   WBC President Jose Sulaiman said a second Tyson-Douglas bout
could be ordered. Tyson said he wanted a rematch.

   Nelson Mandela walked through a
prison gate to freedom Sunday, welcomed joyfully by blacks as their
leader after 27 years in jail for choosing to take up arms against
apartheid.
   But violence broke out an hour later as Mandela's motorcade
arrived at City Hall in Cape Town after a 35-mile drive from the
prison complex in Paarl.
   At least 26 people were reported injured when riot police with
shotguns opened fire after dozens of black youths smashed shop
windows. Some youths retaliated by hurling bottles at the officers.
   Tens of thousands of people had gathered outside City Hall to
hear Mandela address a welcoming rally. When the violence began,
anti-apartheid leaders told the crowd to disperse, but there was
confusion about whether another venue for the rally would be found.
   First aid workers said at least 20 people were hospitalized
after being hit by birdshot, and at least six other people were
being treated at a first aid station.
   Earlier, throngs of supporters, many waving flags of Mandela's
African National Congress, broke into a thunderous cheer as he and
his wife, Winnie, walked hand in hand through the gateway of Victor
Verster prison in Paarl.
   The Mandelas gave clenched-fist salutes to the hundreds of
supporters who had waited for hours outside the prison to welcome
the nationalist leader.
   Mandela, dressed in a dark suit and tie, appeared solemn and
dignified as he and his wife walked to a white BMW sedan and
climbed in. He broke into a broad smile as the car set off slowly
toward Cape Town in a police-escorted motorcade.
   Supporters reached out to touch the car as it passed and waved
flags of Mandela's recently legalized ANC. Mandela raised his hand
in salute to the crowd.
   Scores of policemen stood guard in the bright sunshine, and a
small army of photographers and television crews from across the
world frenetically took the first pictures of Mandela as a free man.
   ``I'm too much happy,'' said Nelson Dlula, a black teen-ager in
the crowd. He wore a khaki outfit decorated with the ANC's green,
gold and black colors.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. gave live
television coverage to the release.
   ``This is the moment the world has been waiting for,'' said the
television reporter at the scene. ``The sun is shining on South
Africa.''
   Mandela, 71, was to make a statement to the press in Cape Town
after his release from imprisonment since 1962, then address a
rally at City Hall.
   Three hours before the scheduled start of the rally, thousands
of people _ mostly blacks but also some whites _ began assembling
in the plaza outside City Hall, many wearing T-shirts with
Mandela's picture.
   In Johannesburg, hundreds of young blacks, joined by a few
whites, ran through downtown streets shooting, ``Viva ANC'' after
the release. Traffic police patrol cars cleared the way for them.
   In Soweto, the sprawling black township outside Johannesburg
where Mandela has his home, crowds of supporters danced and sang in
celebration, many under umbrellas because of a steady rain.
   The decision to free Mandela was announced Saturday by President
F.W. de Klerk, who had met Mandela the previous night. He described
the black leader as ``committed to a peaceful solution.''
   De Klerk, who lifted a 30-year ban on the ANC on Feb. 2,
expressed hope that Mandela's release would lead to racial
reconciliation.
   Mandela has offered to serve as mediator in arranging talks
between the government and the ANC on a post-apartheid constitution
that would give voting rights to the black majority.
   Mandela has been serving a life sentence after he a conviction
of sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-led government.
   Many South African blacks consider him their paramount leader,
and he would be a favorite to win the presidency if blacks were
allowed to vote.
   Mandela's freedom has been a longstanding demand of black
leaders in South Africa, as well as governments and human rights
groups abroad, and the decision drew immediate international praise.
   De Klerk, in his historic speech Feb. 2, lifted bans and
restrictions on the ANC and other opposition groups, scrapped some
state-of-emergency regulations, declared a moratorium on hangings,
and promised to free Mandela unconditionally.
   These concessions met most, but not all, of the ANC's conditions
for negotiations. The organization, and Mandela, also have demanded
freedom for all political prisoners and an end to the state of
emergency.
   P.W. Botha, who de Klerk succeeded in August, had offered to
free Mandela in exchange for a public renunciation of violence, but
Mandela refused.
   Under South Africa's system of apartheid, the 28 million blacks
have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the
economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health
services.

<TEXT>
   A baby humpback whale that became caught in
fishing nets was rescued Sunday after an American marine biologist
dived into the sea and cut the mammal loose.
   Fisherman Abdullah Khadouri spotted the 21-foot dark gray whale
trapped and dying in about 130 feet of water at the mouth of
Shutaifi Bay, close to Muscat harbor.
   Fishermen alerted the coast guard, who called in scientists from
the Oman Marine Science Center.
   Jonathan Mee, 29, from San Francisco, who is working at the
center, managed to free the whale after a dozen dives.
   Once freed, it swam out toward Fahal island off the northern
coast and was seen heading toward the open sea, Mee said.
   ``It was still alive when I got to it initially, but it was in
great distress,'' he told The Associated Press. ``Its tail was free
but the rest of its body was caught in thick rope. Its eyes were
closed very tightly and it was making whimpering noises which
reverberated through the water.''
   Mee said he could not tell how long the whale had been entangled.
   ``We believe it may have been traveling with its mother before
losing its way and becoming caught in the nets,'' he said.
   The last humpback whale sighted in Oman was on Christmas Eve in
1988 when three adult whales were beached off the eastern coast.
They were released, and a school of dolphins led them to open sea.

   A sharp earthquake jolted this northern
industrial city Sunday morning, causing some panic but no
casualties or serious damage.
   The tremor, which occurred at 8 a.m., registered 4.2 on the
Richter scale and had its epicenter just west of the city,
seismologists said.
   The quake cut electricity for about a minute throughout Turin,
set off car and burglar alarms and sent many residents rushing out
of their houses. Police and fire department switchboards were
flooded with calls from alarmed citizens.
   Authorities said a few old buildings suffered cracks, but no
major damage was reported.
   A quake of magnitude 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate
damage. The scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a

<HEAD>Eritrean Rebels Claim Capture of Key Port</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops and secessionist
rebels battled for a fourth day Sunday for Ethiopia's vital Red Sea
port of Massawa, state radio said.
   The Sunday morning broadcast by the government-controlled
station conflicted with an earlier claim by the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front that it had captured the city.
   That claim was made in a broadcast Saturday night by the ``Voice
of the Broad Masses of Eritrea,'' the rebels' clandestine radio
station.
   The government broadcast did not directly deny the rebel claim
but said fighting was continuing around the port, one of only two
on Ethiopia's Red Sea coast.
   Massawa is a key staging point for emergency food donated
through the United Nations for an estimated 4 million people facing
famine in northern Ethiopia this year.
   The state radio said Ethiopia's army and navy were ``paying
heavy sacrifices'' to defend the city, but it gave no sources for
its report.
   Ashagre Yigletu, deputy prime minister for social affairs, said
Saturday the renewed fighting around Massawa had effectively halted
the relief effort.
   The United Nations hoped to ship some 700,000 tons of food in
the next few months to northern drought victims, most of them in
Eritrea and neighboring Tigre provinces.
   Most of that aid would have been delivered by ship to Massawa,
although detailed plans for its distribution have not been worked
out.
   The rebels broke an almost year-long lull in fighting in Eritrea
by launching a massive offensive Thursday that clearly had the
capture of Massawa as a primary objective.
   In the first three days of fighting, the rebels claimed to have
destroyed eight government brigades totaling about 12,000 troops,
most of them entrenched along the 40-mile road linking Massawa with
the provincial capital of Asmara.
   The Eritrean rebel attack erupted as the government appeared to
be containing another offensive in the far south by a separate
insurgent group, the Tigre People's Liberation Front.
   Foreign Minister Tesfaye Dinka told diplomats in Addis Ababa on
Saturday that the Eritrean offensive appeared aimed at taking
pressure off the Tigrean rebels.
   While they do not share common goals, the two insurgent groups
have long maintained a loose alliance and have been known to
coordinate their attacks against government forces.
   The Tigrean rebels launched their own offensive in late August,
sweeping south and east out of Tigre into the neighboring provinces
of Wollo and Gondor.
   A government counteroffensive begun in January appeared to have
halted and in some areas pushed back the Tigreans' southern drive,
which at one point came within 75 miles of the capital.
   In what has become Africa's oldest war, the Eritreans have been
fighting since 1961 for independence for Ethiopia's northernmost
province, once an Italian colony.
   The Tigrean rebels took up arms 14 years ago in an attempt to
topple President Mengistu Haile Marian. They say they want to
replace Mengistu's socialist regime with a government modeled after
that of Albania, the last hard-line Communist nation in Eastern
Europe.

<HEAD>Writers Appeal to World Leaders to Help Stop Rushdie Threats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 160 writers from across the globe
appealed to world leaders Sunday to help stop the death threats
against British author Salman Rushdie.
   The writers, including Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel, a
playwright, signed a statement prepared by the International
Committee for the Defense of Salman Rushdie and his Publishers. It
appeared in more than 20 newspapers worldwide.
   Rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since Feb. 14,
1989, when the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran accused him of
blaspheming Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses'' and ordered
his death. The edict was repeated on Friday by Khomeini's
successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
   ``We call on world leaders and all those in positions of
influence to renew their efforts to end the persecution of Salman
Rushdie and his publishers,'' said the writers' statement.
   ``We wish to restate that it is the right of all people to
express their ideas and beliefs and to discuss them with their
critics on the basis of mutual tolerance, free from censorship,
intimidation and violence.''
   The writers said that by expressing his right to freedom of
expression, Rushdie was committing no crime. It noted, however,
that opponents of his book have attacked bookshops in Britain and
made threatening phone calls to Rushdie's publishers.
   In March, more than 1,000 writers from around the world signed a
statement supporting Rushdie's right to freedom of expression and
repudiating the death threat. It appeared in 62 newspapers and
periodicals in 22 countries.
   Sunday's statement was signed by Rushdie's wife, American
novelist Marianne Wiggins, by Nobel Prize winners Joseph Brodsky
and Sir William Golding, playwrights Arthur Miller and Harold
Pinter, Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood, and poets Allen Ginsberg
and Bei Dao.
   South African writers Breyten Breytenbach and Nadine Gordimer,
director-screenwriter Hanif Kureishi, and authors Catherine
Cookson, Antonia Fraser, Kazuo Ishiguro, Edna O'Brien, Larry
McMurtry, Toni Morrison, Susan Sontag and Kurt Vonnegut also were
among those who signed it.

Mongolia's Communists do the same in a rally Sunday that drew
thousands of people, a source said.
   About 4,000 to 5,000 Mongolians attended the three-hour
demonstration in front of the Lenin Museum in Mongolia's capital,
Ulan Bator, said a foreign source contacted by telephone from
Beijing.
   It was the fifth demonstration called by the Mongolian
Democratic Union, founded in December by artists and intellectuals.
   The rally was called late Wednesday or Thursday, the source
said, after the Soviet Communist Party voted to relinquish its
decades-old hold on political power.
   Mongolia, ruled by Communists since 1921 and long a client of
the Soviet Union, has cautiously followed the Soviet lead in
embracing ``perestroika,'' or reform, but apparently not quickly
enough for some of its citizens.
   Some speakers Sunday called for the resignation of President
Jambyn Batmonh and the Politburo and criticized Premier Dumaagiyn
Sodnom for the nation's ``stagnant'' economy.
   But the speakers stressed that they were not against the party,
just opposed to its monopoly on power, said the source, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Indeed, two banners showed the union working with the party to
combat bureaucratism. One depicted the union on one side of a saw
and the party on the other side, cutting down a tree representing
the bureaucracy, he said.
   Other banners gave a glimpse of some of the complaints and
concerns of the Mongolian people. Some said ``Livestock to the
herdsman,'' ``If people are rich, the state will be rich,'' and
``Is it true we are saddled by loans,'' a reference to the Soviet
Union's massive loans to Mongolia, put at $5.5 billion by some
economists, the source said.
   Unlike previous rallies, which were dominated by union
officials, speakers Sunday included a taxi driver, a factory
worker, an elderly woman, a coal miner and a herdsman from the
countryside, the source said. Many said they were members of the
union, which claims a total membership of 60,000.
   Some speakers recounted stories of union members being fired
from their jobs or lectured because of their political activities.
   The union has called for an end to Communist Party influence
over government affairs, debate on setting up a multiparty system,
a full-time parliament and investigations of past repressive
regimes.
   The source said Sunday's rally was peaceful with almost no
police or military presence. He said the museum apparently is not
one of the sites where demonstrations were banned by the city
council three weeks ago.
   Union spokesmen said meetings were being held in other parts of
the country. No plans were announced for future rallies, but the
union said it still planned to hold a one-day congress next Sunday,
although no location has been found.
   The source said the Mongolian press had reported the formation
of other political groups. Newspapers and other reports say a Green
Party and a Mongolian Patriotic Unity Front, which appears to be
acting as a mediator between the Communist Party and the democratic
union, have been founded, he said.
   Mongolia is a nation of 2 million scattered across the vast
deserts and grasslands of eastern Asia between China and the Soviet
Union. Its economy and culture have long been dominated by the
Soviet Union. The Russian Cyrillic alphabet was officially adopted
in 1946, and traditional Mongolia script was banned until about
five years ago.

   Top trade negotiators from the Soviet Union
and the United States sit down for the first time Monday in an
effort to begin dismantling the barriers that have prevented normal
trade relations between the two superpowers for nearly a
half-century.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and Deputy Trade
Representative Julius Katz will be meeting with a Soviet delegation
headed by Yuriy N. Chumakov, deputy minister of foreign economic
relations.
   Both sides are working under a tight deadline trying to hammer
out a wide ranging agreement in advance of the June summit meeting
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The administration hopes that normalizing trade relations
between the two nations will give a boost to the Soviet economy and
lend economic support to the political reforms being undertaken by
Gorbachev.
   In announcing the start of talks last week, Hills said the
administration's goal was to ``encourage economic reform within the
Soviet Union as it moves toward a more market-driven economy.''
   As part of the trade agreement, which would have to be approved
by Congress, the United States would waive high tariffs that in
some cases boost the duties on Soviet goods by 10 times over
tariffs imposed on similar goods from other countries.
   The high tariffs have been required under a 1974 law known as
the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which erected the trade barriers on
the basis that Moscow was prohibiting Soviet Jews and other
dissidents from leaving the country.
   Bush has signaled that the administration is ready to seek a
waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment based on actions the Soviets
have taken in the past year to boost Jewish emigration.
   Granting the lower tariffs requires completion of a trade
agreement, something Bush has said he hopes to be able to sign when
he meets in June with Gorbachev.
   U.S. consumers would see lower prices for such popular items as
Soviet vodka, which by one estimate could drop in price by $1.25 a
bottle, and for luxury items such as Russian furs.
   Through the first 11 months of 1989, Soviet imports to the
United States totaled just $658 million, far below even China,
which had imports of $11.05 billion during the same time period.
   U.S. export sales to the Soviet Union totaled $3.82 billion
through November, resulting in two-way trade of $4.48 billion. The
administration is predicting that the trade figure could jump to
between $10 billion and $15 billion within the next two or three
years.
   American farm groups are watching the current trade negotiations
with keen interest. Three-fourths of U.S. export sales to the
Soviet Union involve American farm products and the Soviets
reportedly have stated they will not approve a new grain sales
agreement with the United States until they are granted the lower
tariffs on their products.
   Many analysts, however, question the administration's projection
on how much a new treaty could mean in increased trade, noting that
the Soviet economy is facing severe problems at present which make
it difficult for the country to afford imports from abroad.
   ``I am not all that optimistic about significant increases in
trade flows until the Soviet economy is reformed,'' said Richard
Kaufman, an expert on Soviet affairs with the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress. ``The reforms that have captured world
attention so far have all been on the political and social level.''
   Robert Cullen, editor of Soviet-American Trade, a newsletter on
the subject, said that the trade agreement will help Gorbachev more
politically than it will boost trade between the two countries.
   ``Even with a trade agreement, the fundamental barriers between
the Soviet Union and America, such as not having a convertible
ruble, are not going to be alleviated,'' Cullen said.
   One primary area of dispute in the trade talks is expected to be
differences over how the waiver of the Jackson-Vanik tariffs will
be accomplished. The administration would like a three-year trade
agreement with annual presidential review and waiver of the high
tariffs.
   The Soviets, however, would like to see the tariffs removed
permanently as a way of building confidence among business leaders
that trade relations will remain stable in coming years.
   Micah Naftalin, national director of the Union of Councils for
Soviet Jews, said his organization favors one-year waivers. ``The
country is still extraordinarily unstable and we should take it
step by step.''
   The administration will come to the bargaining table seeking a
trade agreement guaranteeing the protection of American-patented
products from piracy, an arbitration method to settle business
disputes and provisions to allow either country to impose temporary
trade restrictions if a domestic industry suffers injury because of
an unexpected surge of imports.
   Congress has let the administration know that it expects to be
consulted as the negotiations progress. Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, put Hills on notice last week that
such consultations will be necessary to win congressional approval
of any deal that is negotiated.

<HEAD>After Mandela's Release: South Africa Faces The Real Challenge</HEAD>

   Once the euphoria over Nelson
Mandela's release dies down, South Africa will still face the
enormous challenge of ending its centuries-old racial divisions and
building a new nation.
   Black and white leaders say a major era in the country's history
is coming to an end with the impending demise of white-minority
rule. But the future is foreboding, they warn, with many obstacles
and the threat of conflict ahead.
   South Africans must peacefully solve the country's problems and
find a way to live together in equality after 40 years of
apartheid, leaders say. But the white government and its opponents
appear to be far apart, with whites insisting on a special role in
the future despite black objections.
   ``Now there can be no going back. Irreversibly, South Africa has
been placed on the path to its new future,'' The Sunday Times said
in an editorial reflecting the views of a growing number of South
Africans.
   While the search for peace is likely to be long and difficult,
changes that would have been unthinkable even a year or two ago are
already taking place.
   President F.W. de Klerk's decision to free Mandela and end bans
on black opposition groups after years of armed conflict stunned
many whites and blacks. He pledged to find ``a new dispensation''
that would end the exclusion of the country's 28 million blacks
from political power.
   De Klerk says he opposes black majority rule and that a new
constitution must include protection for ``group rights'' to ensure
whites are not swamped in a future democratic state. The government
says it will also retain, for now, such apartheid legislation as
laws segregating residential districts.
   While the government declines to outline its position in talks
on a future constitution, governing National Party officials say
they favor splitting the country into a series of racially based,
semi-independent cantons or counties.
   The cantons would be united under a federation that would
oversee economic cooperation and other national issues.
   Critics reject such plans as ``apartheid in another guise'' and
the ANC and other opposition groups say they will accept nothing
less than total democracy.
   Mandela has indicated he will not bend on his insistence on
equal rights. ``We must work toward a common destiny, and that can
only be achieved through a non-racial society and not one in which
whites continue to demand special political treatment,'' Mandela
was quoted as saying by the South African Press Association.
   The 5 million whites in South Africa control the economy, and
there is a huge gulf between the prosperity of most whites and the
bleak poverty of the great majority of blacks.
   But while de Klerk and Mandela attempt to find a peaceful
solution, there are many whites and blacks who will oppose any
compromise and insist on total power for their side alone.
   Many whites are unhappy about the steps de Klerk has taken, and
the opposition Conservative Party is attempting to force an
election to oust the government. Political observers say de Klerk's
white support is uncertain and he has to move quickly and
decisively.
   Many whites looked worried or scared as they watched cheering
and singing blacks surging through parts of central Johannesburg on
Saturday after Mandela's release date was announced.
   A handful of blacks taunted whites, yelling ``Freedom is coming!
Whites get out!'' A few furious whites lashed out, hurling bottles
and insults at the blacks.
   An hour after Mandela's motorcade reached Cape Town city hall
after his release Sunday, riot police clashed with black youths,
and more than two dozen people were reported injured.
   Government leaders are worried about a violent reaction by
extreme right-wingers, and security officials are braced for
terrorism. Some political analysts have raised the possibility of a
military coup, but the government insists it has the full support
of the defense forces.
   The ANC and other anti-apartheid groups face major divisions.
The ANC is split between moderates and hard-liners favoring a
military campaign, and some black groups oppose any negotiations
with the white government.
   Mandela faces the challenge of trying to organize a broad
coalition to present a united front to both the government and to
more militant black groups. Mandela's task is likely to be easier
than de Klerk's since many blacks regard him as their leader.
   Despite the enormous challenges, many whites and blacks appear
hopeful they can solve their differences peacefully and find a way
to live together without being tied down by the past.

<HEAD>Man Accused of Shooting at Nakasone's Campaign Office</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Sunday arrested an ultra-rightist accused
of firing several shots inside the campaign office of former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, the second attack on a Japanese
politician in less than a month.
   Nakasone was not in the office at the time, and none of the 11
people inside was injured, police said.
   The attack, following the Jan. 18 shooting of Nagasaki's mayor,
heightened concern that ultra-rightist groups are becoming
increasingly violent after keeping a low profile during a year of
mourning for the late Emperor Hirohito.
   Japanese rightsts revere the imperial family and are believed to
be dissatisfied with Nakasone's and other governing Liberal
Democratic Party leaders' links to an influence-buying scandal.
   They also are unhappy with the government's willingness to hear
debate on whether the state should fund several coronation
ceremonies for Emperor Akihito.
   Rightist groups, their vans painted in drab military colors,
were out in force Sunday for a national holiday that marks the
founding of the Japanese nation.
   Police said Koji Konishi, 23, entered the Nakasone campaign
office in Takasaki city, 60 miles northwest of Tokyo, and fired
three shots at a television set, a campaign poster and a doll
symbolizing good luck.
   Police said Konishi identified himself as a member of the
rightist Seiji Kessha Kokuyukai (Political Organization for Those
Concerned About the Nation).
   Police said Konishi told them he didn't intend to kill anyone
but dislikes Nakasone and wanted to ``create a ruckus'' to show the
rest of Japan how the politician had ``made a fool of the Japanese
people.''
   Katsumi Kobayashi, a Nakasone aide, said he had no idea what
Konishi's motive might have been and said the office had received
no threatening phone calls or letters.
   He said a rightist was arrested in Tokyo last spring for
planning an attack on Nakasone, who served as prime minister in
1982-87.
   ``We cannot allow free democracy, free elections to be trampled
on by such acts of violence,'' Nakasone told reporters.
   Nakasone, who is seeking re-election to the lower house of
Parliament, was delivering a speech to supporters elsewhere in the
city when the attack occurred.
   Last year, another member of Konishi's group, which police say
has fewer than 20 members and is based in Tokyo, severed a finger
and sent it to then-Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, Nakasone's
successor, to protest ``dirty politicians.''
   Police estimate the number of ultra-rightists in Japan at
120,000 in roughly 820 groups.
   Only 10 days after the official mourning period for Emperor
Hirohito ended on Jan. 8, the mayor of Nagasaki, Hitoshi Motoshima,
was shot in the back as he was leaving City Hall. A member of a
rightist group, Kazumi Tajiri, has been charged with attempted
murder in the attack.
   Motoshima had received numerous death threats after saying in
December 1988 that Hirohito shared responsibility for Japan's
participation in World War II.

   Sigrid Kluge says she welcomes the Soviet
green light for German reunification, but she fears developments
are moving too quickly and threaten to swallow up her country.
   ``I want unification, not colonization,'' the young mother said
Sunday as she pushed her daughter in a stroller across East
Berlin's huge Alexander Square.
   The drive toward unification gained a boost on Saturday, when
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev had agreed that a decision on the issue ``is the sole
right of the German people,'' including the time frame and the
method.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Sunday
the Soviet leadership cleared the way for German unification
because Moscow officials believe it will improve European stability.
   While it is almost impossible to judge the nationwide reaction
to the developments, many East Germans queried at random Sunday
were wary about the rapid pace of events in their country, which
until four months ago was under the grip of a hard-line Communist
regime.
   Some appeared especially concerned by Kohl's assertion that a
reunification plan could be presented by the end of this year.
   ``We should wait until our economy is stronger, so that we can
have a say in forming a new Germany, with all the best points of
both countries,'' said Ms. Kluge, an office clerk.
   But West Germans say it is the reported near-collapse of the
East German economy that makes unification so pressing now.
   Ms. Kluge was worried about the possible loss of East Germany's
extensive social services. The services are designed to provide
literally cradle-to-grave security for all citizens, although the
social safety net is unraveling.
   ``As a single mother, I don't know what I'd do without all the
state child care and other benefits we have here,'' Ms. Kluge said.
   Edith Puechner, 52, a high school teacher from Leipzig, said
things are happening too quickly for people to adapt. She appeared
concerned by Kohl's assertion that unification could be approved by
the end of the year.
   ``We have to adjust to both democracy and a new economic system,
and that takes time,'' Ms. Puechner said. ``People are going to be
shocked by unemployment. Many will have to be trained for jobs in
entirely different areas.''
   With East Germans still heading West at a rate of 1,800 per day,
none of those questioned in East Berlin disagreed that unification
was inevitable. The only uncertainty appeared to be how soon and on
what terms.
   Some felt unification could not come soon enough.
   ``There's no use maintaining this system any longer. It's time
to just dump it,'' said Rudolf Mueller, a 56-year-old garment
worker. ``Most of my friends and family have left already. I
sometimes feel like the only one who's still here.''
   ``Unification as fast as possible is the last chance for our
country,'' said Hans-Christian Schlesinger, 37, who runs his own
business selling work clothes.
   ``I've been struggling along for years with my business. I have
to deal with so many restrictions and complications,'' he said.
   Schlesinger and his wife, Marita, said they have attended
meetings with visiting West Germans to get advice on how to run
private businesses.
   ``We're just starting to organize ourselves now, and the general
feeling about the future is pretty optimistic,'' he said.
   None of those interviewed favored a unified Germany being part
of NATO. Instead, all spoke out for German neutrality.
   Most said that only neutrality would convince neighboring
countries they have nothing to fear from a unified Germany.
   They also argued against adding to either NATO or the Warsaw
Pact at a time when the world is moving toward disarmament.
   Some expressed dismay at the ``aggressive'' turn they say their
revolution has taken.
   ``I find this `Germany united fatherland' business very
dangerous,'' said Juergen Ritter, 50, a manager in a state-run oil
company. He was referring to a slogan frequently chanted at
demonstrations in East Germany.

<TEXT>
   It was just after sunrise on day two of
Andrew Young's campaign trip for the Georgia Statehouse, and when
the oceanographic vessel Cape Hatteras docked along the Savannah
River he went aboard to shake hands.
   Few, if any, of the North Carolina-based scientists on the
research ship can vote in Georgia.
   But it'll look great on TV.
   And that was part _ maybe even most _ of the point as Young,
former congressman, former ambassador to the United Nations, former
mayor of Atlanta, launched his bid to become Georgia's first black
governor in a campaign stressing media savvy over race.
   Reporters accompanying the Democrat joked about the ``stealth''
campaign seemingly able to slip in and out of towns without meeting
an actual Georgia voter.
   But everywhere Young went, he was followed by his film crew
snaring footage for the all-important TV spots that Georgia viewers
won't see for months.
   Gov. Joe Frank Harris, a Democrat, is barred by the state
constitution from running for a third consecutive term, just as
Young was barred last year from seeking his third consecutive term
as Atlanta mayor.
   The consensus is that Young, a popular black leader facing a
crowded field of white candidates, is assured of finishing in the
top two in the July 17 Democratic primary. Unless someone gets more
than half the vote, the top two finishers will face each other in a
runoff Aug. 7.
   Young's campaign is hard at work on a barrage of campaign
commercials he'll unleash in those final weeks.
   ``People aren't paying attention yet now,'' said Frank Greer,
Young's media guru, watching the Savannah River filming.
   Under the direction of Greer, who masterminded the media push as
Virginia's Doug Wilder became the nation's first black governor
last fall, little is left to chance, and anything can be a photo
opportunity.
   The docking of the Cape Hatteras was more than a coincidence; a
Young volunteer said the campaign had sent word to the ship and
offered the crew an opportunity to be on TV with a real live
political superstar.
   The backdrop for the filming was a big bridge under construction
_ a bridge whose funds Young voted for, years ago, as a congressman
from Atlanta. When a reporter surmised the connection, he got a
congratulatory bear hug from the ebullient Greer.
   In Augusta, a visit by Young to the new River Walk development
was ignored by most of the local media. A half hour of handshaking
snared three tourists from Delaware, a man from Virginia and a
couple of shopkeepers.
   But the crew got some great film of Young and his wife, Jean,
nuzzling by the river.
   If all this seems sort of cynical, Greer explained that in 1990,
in a state of 6 million people, you just don't meet many voters
down at the courthouse square.
   ``In this day and age, the way you meet voters is through the
media,'' Greer said.
   But two traditional courthouse speech stops last week showed
that Young is pretty good when he does speak to actual voters.
   In the southeast Georgia town of Waynesboro, Tuesday's itinerary
called for a meeting with local officials. But when a crowd of 75
or so greeted Young, he hopped up the courthouse steps and went to
work _ no text, no microphone, just his message of new businesses,
new jobs, a commitment to abortion rights and a public vote on a
lottery.
   The next day, Young delivered the only formal speech of the
four-day tour, to a crowd of 250 at the courthouse in Thomasville.
It was a special event for Young as he spoke, tearfully, about
beginning his ministerial career in the small southern Georgia town
some 35 years ago.
   In an interview last week while his campaign van rolled through
eastern Georgia, Young said he enjoys campaigning and likened his
first statewide race to his travels organizing voting rights drives
in the heyday of the civil rights movement.
   Like Wilder in Virginia, Young isn't directly mentioning the
race question; there are no emotional entreaties to white voters to
give him a chance.
   ``The word `black' very seldom comes up in the polling,'' he
said. ``We don't ask racial questions, and people don't raise 'em.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hit films like ``Ghostbusters'' and ``E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial'' are forbidden videos at some nursing homes that
gave up movies rather than meet Hollywood's demands they buy a
license to pop a cassette into the VCR.
   The nursing homes say they should be treated like ordinary homes
_ exempt from videocassette copyright restrictions _ when residents
gather in a common living area to watch a movie.
   ``When people come to a nursing home or a retirement home it is
for life and it is their home,'' said Stella Muller, leisure
director for Marquette Manor in Indianapolis. ``We don't see why we
can't have a gathering in the front parlor and show a movie.''
   Hollywood takes a different view.
   The motion picture industry lumps nursing homes in the same
category as libraries, colleges, churches, prisons, oil rigs and
other institutions that show home videos to groups of people.
   Such organizations are required to buy a public performance
license, as do movie theaters, for each copyright video they show
or they can purchase an annual ``umbrella'' license giving them the
right to show unlimited videos from certain studios.
   Nursing home officials say a typical fee would be $3.65 per bed
per year, or $730 for a home with 200 residents.
   The nursing homes are backing legislation pending in the House
and Senate that would allow unlicensed public viewing of videos in
a ``hospital, hospice, nursing home or other group home providing
health or health-related care and services to individuals on a
regular basis,'' as long as the facilities do not charge for the
viewing or further retransmit the material.
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., first introduced the legislation in
1988 after receiving a letter from 10 elderly residents of Emily P.
Bissell Hospital, a state-run nursing home in Wilmington, Del.
   ``It is not our choice that we are here, but we are, and our
lives are now changed in many, many ways,'' the residents wrote.
``If the staff ... could show us some of the movies available on
videocassette, it would certainly bring us a lot of pleasure.''
   Barbara Dixon of the Motion Picture Association of America,
which represents major Hollywood production companies and
distributors, said MPAA is working with congressional staff to find
a compromise that would address nursing home concerns without
setting ``a precedent that we might come to regret later on.''
   ``If a movie's shown in an individual room ... that is probably
not a violation of the copyright law. But if it's shown in a public
accommodation area where it can be viewed by large numbers of
people then you run into a legitimate concern,'' she said in an
interview last week.
   The legislation would exempt health care facilities under the
``home use'' exception contained in copyright licensing laws, as is
non-commercial viewing of films or videos in individual residences.
   The measure is supported by the American Association of Homes
for the Aging (AAHA), the American Health Care Association, the
National Association of Activity Professionals and other groups
representing the elderly.
   ``Residents should be able to view these films in their
residences or homes the same way all of us watch films with our own
families in our own living rooms,'' AAHA, which represents
non-profit nursing homes, said in a recent legislative alert to its
members.
   Because of the licensing dispute, some nursing homes no longer
have movie nights, show only classics on which the copyrights have
expired or encourage residents to rent their own videos to watch in
their bedrooms. Some have purchased umbrella licenses, while others
ignore the copyright restrictions and hope they don't get caught,
officials said.
   The licensing push took off in 1986 when the Motion Picture
Licensing Corp., based in Stamford, Conn., was created by three
veterans of the movie business to sell public performance licenses
to various organizations.
   Company chairman Peter Kuyper said the firm is involved in
discussions aimed at resolving the licensing dispute ``without
legislation,'' but he declined to comment further.
   The company's promotional literature says fees vary depending on
the nature and size of the expected audience and how often movies
are to be shown.

   Nelson Mandela walked through a
prison gate to freedom Sunday, setting off joyous celebrations and
violent clashes as blacks nationwide welcomed their leader back
from 27 years in jail.
   ``Comrades and fellow South Africans, I greet you all in the
name of peace, democracy and freedom for all,'' Mandela told tens
of thousands of cheering supporters who thronged outside City Hall,
many getting their first look at the African National Congress
leader.
   ``I stand here before you not at as a prophet, but as a humble
servant of you the people.''
   Within an hour of the release, as Mandela's motorcade arrived at
City Hall, violence broke out. First aid workers and journalists
said one person was killed and more than 100 people injured when
riot police fired shotguns after groups of black youths smashed
shop windows in the city center.
   Some youths retaliated by hurling bottles at the officers.
Hundreds of terrified people waiting to hear Mandela ran for cover
as police fired blasts of shotgun pellets.
   Clashes between police and celebrating blacks were reported in
at least two other areas, while in Johannesburg thousands of young
blacks received an escort from traffic police as they ran
triumphantly through the city. Columns of cheering activists jogged
through Durban and other cities.
   ``We have waited too long for our freedom,'' Mandela told the
crowd. He said that until the proper climate was created for
peaceful negotiations, the armed struggle was still a policy of the
ANC.
   ``The factors that (caused the need for armed struggle) ...
exist today,'' Mandela said. ``We have no options but to continue.''
   ``We express the hope that a climate conducive to a negotiated
settlement would be created.''
   Mandela spoke of ``my long and lonely years in prison.''
   ``I am content that your pain and suffering was far greater than
my own,'' he said, adding that he would make further statements
after consulting his ANC comrades.
   ``There must be an end to white monopoloy of political power and
a fundamental restructureing of our political and economic systems
to ensure that the inequalities of apartheid are addressed,'' he
said.
   The ANC leader called President F.W. de Klerk a man ``of
integrity,'' and called on the white community to ``join us in the
safety of a new South Africa. The freedom movement is a political
home for you, too.''
   Mandela, jailed since 1962 for helping plan the African National
Congress' anti-government guerrilla campaign, was greeted by a
thunderous cheer when he and his wife, Winnie, walked hand in hand
through the gateway of Victor Verster prison in Paarl, 35 miles
from Cape Town.
   The Mandelas gave clenched-fist salutes to the hundreds of
supporters who had waited for hours outside, many of them waving
green, gold and black ANC flags.
   Mandela, dressed in a dark suit and tie, appeared solemn and
dignified as he and his wife walked to a white BMW sedan and
climbed in. He broke into a broad smile as the car set off slowly
toward Cape Town in a police-escorted motorcade.
   Scores of policemen stood guard in the bright sunshine, and a
small army of photographers and television crews from across the
world frenetically took the first pictures of Mandela as a free man.
   ``I'm too much happy,'' said Nelson Dlula, a black teen-ager in
the crowd. He wore a khaki outfit decorated with the ANC's green,
gold and black colors.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. gave live
television coverage to the release.
   ``This is the moment the world has been waiting for,'' said the
television reporter at the scene. ``The sun is shining on South
Africa.''
   Mandela's speech was delayed an hour by the violence. As the
clashes erupted, some anti-apartheid leaders told the crowd to
disperse, but many remained to hear Mandela's voice for the first
time in nearly three decades. Army units equipped with tear gas
were deployed nearby, and police helicopters flew overhead.
   ``Your tireless and heroic sacrfices have made it possible for
me to be here today,'' the 71-year-old Mandela told the adoring
crowd. ``I therefore place the remaining years of my life in your
hands.''
   Dr. Aslam Dasoo, tending the injured at a first aid station,
said about 100 people had been hurt, and journalists counted 130
injuries. There was no immediate statement from police.
   In Johannesburg, hundreds of young blacks, joined by a few
whites, ran through downtown streets shooting, ``Viva ANC!'' after
the release. Traffic police patrol cars cleared the way for them.
   In Soweto, the sprawling black township outside Johannesburg
where Mandela has his home, crowds of supporters danced and sang in
celebration, many under umbrellas because of a steady rain.
   There were unconfirmed reports that three celebrating blacks in
the tribal homeland of Ciskei were shot dead by police. In Inanda,
a black township outside Durban, a local journalist said she saw
one black killed and five injured when police fired at a
celebration.
   The decision to free Mandela was announced Saturday by President
F.W. de Klerk, who had met Mandela the previous night. He described
the black leader as ``committed to a peaceful solution.''
   De Klerk, who lifted a 30-year ban on the ANC on Feb. 2,
expressed hope that Mandela's release would lead to racial
reconciliation.
   Mandela has offered to serve as mediator in arranging talks
between the government and the ANC on a post-apartheid constitution
that would give voting rights to the black majority.
   Mandela had been serving a life sentence after he was convicted
of sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-led government. For
18 years of his imprisonment, he was held on Robben Island in Cape
Town's harbor, where he endured substandard food, deprivation of
news and reading material, and hard labor that included gathering
seaweed and smashing stones.
   Many South African blacks consider him their paramount leader,
and he would be a favorite to win the presidency if blacks were
allowed to vote.
   Under South African apartheid, the nation's black majority has
no voice in national affairs.
   Mandela's freedom has been a longstanding demand of black
leaders in South Africa, as well as governments and human rights
groups abroad.
   De Klerk, in his speech Feb. 2, lifted bans and restrictions on
the ANC and other opposition groups, scrapped some
state-of-emergency regulations, declared a moratorium on hangings,
and promised to free Mandela unconditionally.
   These concessions met most, but not all, of the ANC's conditions
for negotiations. The organization, and Mandela, also have demanded
freedom for all political prisoners and an end to the state of
emergency.
   P.W. Botha, who de Klerk succeeded in August, had offered to
free Mandela in exchange for a public renunciation of violence, but
Mandela refused.

   The hundreds of foreign
journalists who swarmed into South Africa to cover the release of
Nelson Mandela have been getting almost as much attention as the
black leader.
   Local reaction to the media invasion has ranged from allegations
that visiting correspondents organized anti-government protests to
claims that overseas publications offering millions of dollars for
exclusive pictures of Mandela.
   The South African Broadcasting Corporation, the state-run
network, said Sunday that more than 2,000 journalists converged on
South Africa for the release.
   Journalists from North America, Europe and Asia had spent weeks
waiting for Mandela to be set free. A succession of false alarms
over the past few weeks often sent camera crews scuttling to Victor
Verster prison outside Cape Town. Mandela finally walked out of the
prison Sunday after 27 years in custody in various jails.
   The local press has mixed its own coverage on Mandela with often
lurid accounts of the activities of overseas colleagues.
   South African newspapers have run long reports claiming that
American news companies have been offering millions of dollars for
exclusive rights to the first picture of Mandela or the first
exclusive interview. None of the reports has been confirmed.
   Some local media reports last week claimed foreign journalists
helped organize black protesters at a violent protest in
Johannesburg. South African and foreign correspondents on the scene
denied the claims, but police said they were investigating.
   Right-wing extremists flooded radio talk shows in Johannesburg
with claims that foreign journalists concocted false pictures of
street violence to create the impression of widespread unrest.
   ``These foreign journalists are trying to destroy our country,''
said one angry caller.
   Competition between the press for stories and facilities has
sometimes been more frenzied than the quest for stories.
   The area around Mandela's modest home in the black township of
Soweto outside Johannesburg has sprouted in recent weeks with extra
telephone lines, antennae and waiting camera crews.
   Top hotels in Johannesburg and Cape Town have been booked solid
by the foreign press; rental companies say their vehicles and
planes have been rented for weeks; and communications out of Cape
Town have at times been overwhelmed by the deluge of media phone
calls and broadcasts.
   ``It's great. We're making a fortune,'' said a delighted
employee at a Johannesburg car rental firm. He refused to give his
name.

   Former Sen. J. William Fulbright is
getting married.
   The 84-year-old Democrat who represented Arkansas in Congress
for 32 years will marry Harriett Mayor on March 10 in Washington.
Ms. Mayor, 56, is executive director of the Fulbright Association.
   ``We've been really good friends for a long time and it's only
been recently that he asked me to marry him,'' Ms. Mayor said
Saturday in a telephone interview from Washington. ``We talk about
world affairs. That's what got us together, I guess.''
   Fulbright, who chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
for 15 years, said he called Ms. Mayor early one morning several
weeks ago to propose. He said he figured it would take the better
part of the day to persuade her and was surprised when she said yes
right away.
   ``I was afraid she wouldn't accept because I'm old and she's
young, you know,'' Fulbright said in a telephone interview from
Captiva, Fla., where he was visiting one of his two daughters.
   ``I thought this sort of thing was all over for me. Its been a
great surprise,'' he said.
   His wife of 32 years, Elizabeth ``Betty'' Fulbright, died in
October 1985.
   Ms. Mayor said she and Fulbright met three years ago at a board
meeting of the Fulbright Association, which she had just joined.
The association helps Fulbright Scholarship recipients and alumni.

   Actor Tony Curtis has lived off and on at the
Bel-Air Hotel for a quarter century because of what he calls the
most basic of creature comforts _ clean sheets and a spotless
bathroom.
   ``What's particularly appealing is the steadiness of service.
You get spoiled living like that,'' said Curtis, who also has a
home in Hawaii. ``When I get home to Hawaii, I don't have anybody
making my bed every day.
   ``When I am here I use the bed and the telephone and the TV
clicker. That I find most valuable. And if you examine it, that's
all you or I want _ a change of sheets, telephone messages and

happy.''
   For the past 2{ years it has been a ``pretty permanent place''

   Lee Remick says she's been given a clean bill of
health after battling cancer and now wants to revive her career.
   ``I'm very lucky,'' said Remick, 54, in Boston last week to
receive the Jack Lemmon Award, give by the Wang Center to an
outstanding performing aryist with a Massachusetts connection.
``They treated me with all sorts of extraordinary things and
removed a kidney. Then they continued to take my picture ad
nauseam, and they see nothing now. It's amazing.''
   Remick, who grew up in Quincy, was diagnosed with lung and
kidney cancer last spring. After treatment at a Maryland hospital,
Remick recuperated at her home in Osterville on Cape Cod with her
husband, producer Kip Gowans.
   Remick is busy reading scripts but hasn't found one to interest
her yet.
   ``If I were offered a good feature film, I would do it,
certainly. But I haven't been. Nothing really tantalizing has come

   Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal, in Berlin to
pay tribute to the actor who played him in a film of his life
story, says the last thing he sees himself as is a movie hero.
   ``In all this time _ and it's been 45 years, more than half my
life _ there has not been one day when I have forgotten that I am a
survivor,'' Wiesenthal said Saturday in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   He had nothing but praise for the film, ``Murderers Among Us _
The Simon Wiesenthal Story,'' a U.S. television production starring
British actor Ben Kingsley.
   The World War II concentration camp survivor presented Kingsley
with the Golden Camera award, one of West Germany's highest
television honors, for his performance as Wiesenthal.
   ``Kingsley didn't just perform, he got inside my skin,''
Wiesenthal, 81, said of the television movie about his life.
``Watching the film was like seeing parts of my previous life over

   Jurors who will have to decide if pop star
Stevie Wonder stole the song ``I Just Called To Say I Love You''
from another songwriter have heard an early, unfinished version of
the tune.
   Wonder testified in a copyright infringement trial that the
recording that was played Friday was made in 1976 _ at least a year
before he heard a tape of a song he is accused of pilfering.
   Lawyers for plaintiff Lloyd Chiate, a songwriter claiming he was
robbed by Wonder, challenged the authenticity of the tape Wonder
played for the jury, arguing it could have been altered.
   But U.S. District Judge David W. Williams said that the tape
could be introduced as evidence on the basis of Wonder's testimony.
   Wonder's 1984 recording of ``I Just Called To Say I Love You''
won an Academy Award as part of the soundtrack for ``The Woman in
Red.''

   One of the West's best-known editorial
cartoonists has some simple advice for public figures who want to
avoid being ridiculed by him on editorial pages across the country:
   Drop dead.
   As far as nationally syndicated cartoonist Steve Benson is
concerned, dying is the best way public figures can expect a fair
shake from his cartoons, which appear in nearly 200 newspapers
across the nation.
   Benson says the job of cartoonists is to catalyze discussion.
Some credit cartoons he drew for the Arizona Republic as a factor
in the impeachment of former Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham.
   ``We skewer people. We ridicule issues. We make fun of countries
where we have never been. We never let a fact get in the way of a
good cartoon,'' he said. ``But in the end, we get a lot closer to
the truth then most people.''
   ``What we do is get people to think. We are conservatives at
heart. We are trying to protect America and our communities from
abuses by those in power.''

   Sammy Davis Jr. remained hospitalized Sunday
for treatment of his resurgence of throat cancer, and his publicist

<HEAD>Christian Battles Rage in Beirut, 8 Reported Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces battled in
Beirut's rain-drenched alleys and the mountains northeast of the
capital Sunday while civilians dodged bullets to reach the Moslem
sector to buy goods for their trapped families.
   Troops of rebel Gen. Michel Aoun and the rival Lebanese Forces
militia ignored two calls for a cease-fire in their 13-day-old
battle for control of the Christian enclave north of Beirut.
   It is the bloodiest fighting between Christian forces since the
civil war between Lebanon's Moslems and Christians erupted in 1975.
   Police said at least eight people were killed and 17 wounded in
the latest violence. Aoun's headquarters reported 12 soldiers and
four officers wounded.
   Since the fighting broke out Jan. 30, at least 457 people have
died.
   Shell-battered hospitals packed with casualties appealed over
the radio for blood, plasma, oxygen and water.
   In some districts of Christian east Beirut, the stench of death
hung in streets where decomposing bodies have lain for days. Civil
defense teams have not been able to remove them because of sniper
fire.
   Hundreds of frightened civilians dodged sniper fire and sprinted
across the city's dividing Green Line. Many risked their lives to
buy bread and drinking water for their families who were trapped in
underground shelters.
   Others who made it across the 3-mile-long demarcation line
stayed in the the Syrian-policed Moslem sector, outside the combat
zone.
   Police said about 25,000 Christians have crossed into west
Beirut in the last three days.
   Nearly 50,000 other Christians have in recent days fled the
enclave over the mountains that run down its eastern flank, police
reported.
   Five months ago, the Christians were being slaughtered by Syrian
shellfire in a six-month battle between Aoun's troops and the
Syrian Army, which he considers an occupation force.
   ``It's very ironic,'' said Simon Hajjar after darting across the
Green Line. ``We're fleeing to the Syrians from Christian leaders
battling each other under the slogan of ridding Lebanon of Syrian
occupation.''
   As he spoke, gunfire and shell blasts boomed in east Beirut's
Ashrafiyeh residential district and the working-class quarter of
Ein Rummaneh, both Lebanese Forces strongholds that border the
Green Line.
   Police said Aoun's troops and the militiamen of Samir Geagea
fought all night in pouring rain in the narrow alleyways of the two
districts. Neither side apparently made any significant territorial
gains.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said shelling duels were raging in the snow-capped
mountains of Kesrouan, a Maronite Catholic province.
   Mediators representing Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, the Maronites'
spiritual leader, called a cease-fire for 6 p.m. and another for 11
p.m. Saturday, but there was no stop to the fighting.
   On Saturday, Aoun's troops drove the Lebanese Forces out of the
key highway town of Kleiat.
   Both Aoun and Geagea are Maronites, the main Christian sect that
has dominated power in Lebanon since independence from France in
1943.
   The push by Aoun's 19,000 troops into Kesrouan underlined the
general's determination to crush Geagea's militia, which has 6,000
hardcore fighters and thousands more reservists.
   It is the only force challenging his authority in the
310-square-mile Christian enclave, where an estimated 1 million
people live.
   Although both Aoun and Geagea are at odds with Syria, they
differ over a peace plan sponsored by the Arab League to end the
civil war.
   Aoun considers himself the sole legitimate authority in Lebanon.
He was appointed head of an interim military Cabinet Sept. 22,
1988, by outgoing President Amin Gemayel until a successor could be
elected.
   A Syrian-backed Maronite, Elias Hrawi, was elected president by
parliament Nov. 24. Aoun refuses to recognize him.
   He rejects the peace accord because it fails to guarantee a
complete withdrawal of Syrian forces, who entered Lebanon in 1976
under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Geagea has taken no public stand on the peace plan, but he has
recognized Hrawi, who was elected with a mandate to implement the
peace accord.

   The state's powerful education
policy-setting board meets this week to discuss a report which
contends that much of what New York schoolchildren learn is based
on ``hidden assumptions of white supremacy.''
   The state Board of Regents on Friday will take up the task-force
report titled ``A Curriculum of Inclusion,' the latest flashpoint
in a national debate over whether what's taught in schools is
racially fair.
   More than half the panel named by state Education Commissioner
Thomas Sobol are educators, and its 17 members were black,
Hispanic, Asian, American Indian and one white. It was headed by
state NAACP Chairwoman Hazel Dukes.
   Its report concludes that New York's history courses
overemphasize the contributions of white Europeans, minimize the
accomplishments of minorities and largely ignore wrongs committed
by whites against others.
   The task force called on the state to change the way it teaches
history and other subjects to include more about the contributions
of non-whites.
   ``We're saying that the curriculum should be revised to reflect
accurately all contributions so that everybody knows where we as a
nation came from,'' said meteorology professor Harry Hamilton,
author of the report, who teaches at the State University of New
York at Albany.
   He said the report is intended to promote better understanding
between cultures, but its critics say New York education leaders
should be more concerned about disintegrating schools, high dropout
rates and drug addiction.
   ``If schools spend their resources fretting over the worth of
Western culture, it's likely that children will be more woefully
unknowledgeable in the basics than they already are,'' the Wall
Street Journal editorialized recently.
   The controversy has come east from Stanford University, where
complaints that a required freshman course on Western culture
furthered sexual and racial stereotypes led to the inclusion of
more study of non-Western cultures.
   The New York report, released last summer, said most attempts to
talk about non-white cultural contributions were ``appendages'' to
school curriculum.
   In most history courses, white, European culture ``is likened to
the master of a house ruling over a dinner table ... who has
invited the others through his beneficence.''
   The absence of positive references to non-whites has a
``terribly damaging effect on the psyche'' of young blacks,
Hispanics, Asians and Indians, the report said.
   Columnist George Will called the report ``affirmative action run
amok.'' He said its authors sought to ignore the central role
European culture has had in shaping American institutions.
   ``I think the report should be thrown away,'' said Diane
Ravitch, a history professor at Columbia University's Teachers
College and a consultant who reviewed the report for Sobol.
   She says the panel's argument ``logically extends to distorting
history into a kind of feel-good study. And that's not the purpose
of history.''
   Among its examples of bias, the task force cited the lack of
discussion of the role of black soldiers in the Revolutionary War.
It said the ``Mexican War'' more properly should be the less
ethnocentric ``Mexican-American War.''
   The report also said a social-studies curriculum that pictures
on its cover a white family with several generations and a black
family with a single parent sends a ``subtle message'' about family
structures.
   Ravitch said that's not bias. In fact, she said, the report
couldn't cite any real examples of bias in the state curriculum at
all.
   ``It is a temper tantrum,'' Ravitch said of the report. ``I met
with members of the task force and they were very angry people. I
think some of that anger spilled out in this report.''
   Sobol said some of the report's rhetoric was
``counterproductive,'' but agreed that textbooks don't tell enough
about the history of different racial groups and when they do, it's
from a white perspective.
   He's recommending the regents appoint a racially balanced panel
of scholars to write a new curriculum emphasizing cultural
diversity. He also wants a permanent advisory panel to monitor the
curriculum for signs of bias.
   ``It's not just that we should have more black history for black
kids, and more Hispanic history for Hispanic kids,'' he said. ``All
of our kids should know more about all the rest of our kids.
Otherwise, they don't connect.''

   NATO and Warsaw Pact negotiators begin talks
Monday on opening their skies to surveillance flights now that
political developments in the Soviet bloc have reduced Cold War
tensions.
   The proposal to be considered at the three-week ``Open Skies''
conference would allow the alliances to fly unarmed aircraft over
each other's territory to monitor military installations and
compliance with arms agreements.
   The 16 members of NATO and the seven Warsaw Pact countries
already have agreed in principle to implement the idea, resurrected
in the spring of 1989 by President Bush from a proposal first put
forth in the 1950s.
   Since Bush made the proposal to build good will and trust,
hard-line Communist governments have fallen throughout Eastern
Europe. Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland already have begun to
scale back their armies and demand Moscow withdraw tens of
thousands of Red Army troops from their soil.
   East Germany, Bulgaria and Romania are likely to follow suit,
while the Soviet Union has proposed further troop and arms cuts and
publicly switched its military doctrine from an offensive to a
defensive stance.
   ``When (Open Skies) was proposed a year ago, the world was a
different place,'' said Paul Stares, a research associate at the
Brookings Institute, a non-partisan think tank in Washington. ``Our
suspicions have dropped dramatically and people are wondering, `If
peace and love have really broken out, what do we need these
(treaties) for?'''
   ``A year ago, everyone thought (Open Skies) was a swell idea,''
said James Blackwell, deputy director of political-military studies
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington. ``Now everybody thinks it would be really useful,'' and
possible.
   Civilian or military aircraft would be allowed to fly over the
United States, Soviet Union, Canada and NATO and East bloc states
of Europe. Larger countries would allow several flights a month.
   The duration of the flights would be limited, and planes would
be open to inspection before and after the flights. Negotiators
must work out quotas, flight routes and other details.
   Some question remain whether such an agreement would be worth
the effort.
   The United States and Soviet Union each have satellites capable
of detailed ground monitoring even at night and through clouds.
   And the talks are not directly connected to any arms or troop
cut negotiations, which likely would include their own verification
provisions.
   Officials, however, believe flights would be more flexible for
monitoring than satellites, which are restricted to certain orbits.
Such flights also would benefit countries that do not have
surveillance satellites.
   Blackwell said, ``Any Open Skies agreement would make the
verification task much easier.'' He said monitoring of the
disarmament treaties now being discussed would require ``hundreds
of thousands'' of people across Europe.
   ``We would need as many soldiers to monitor the talks as we plan
to withdraw,'' he said.
   Stares said some duplication of monitoring might result but that
such flights would be the best way to monitor compliance within the
United States and east of the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union.
   Stares emphasized that an agreement ``would codify the principle
that everybody talks about for greater transparency in world
affairs.'' He added, ``As a general principle to lower our
uncertainty, I think it's a good thing.'' An ``Open Skies''
agreement also could set a precedent for flights over other trouble
spots in the world, such as the Middle East, or for monitoring
countries suspected of violating pollution controls, Stares said.
   The first round of talks in Ottawa will last three weeks.
   Foreign ministers from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and the Warsaw Pact will attend only the first three days.
   A second round is planned in April in Budapest, Hungary.
   NATO officials have said they would like an agreement quickly,
hopefully by the middle of the year. The Warsaw Pact has not stated
a formal position.

   Two cosmonauts took President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's drive for economic efficiency to new heights Sunday,
blasting off on the Soviet Union's first space mission designed to
turn a profit.
   Riding a Soyuz TM-9 capsule, flight commander Anatoly Solovyov,
42, and engineer Alexander Balandin, 36, soared atop a column of
orange-white flames into cloud-streaked skies over the Baikonur
space complex in Soviet Kazakhstan at 9:16 a.m.
   Their on-schedule launch was televised live, and for the first
time, four active U.S. astronauts were invited to the formerly
top-secret spaceport on the steppes of Central Asia to watch it.
They were Dan Brandenstein, head of NASA's astronaut office and
commander of the 11-day January mission of the space shuttle
Columbia, and Paul Weitz, Ron Grabe and Jerry Ross.
   The Americans' presence was additional proof of how Gorbachev's
leadership has led to more openness and a rollback of the obsessive
secrecy that once cloaked Soviet space ventures.
   Solovyov, who led a joint Soviet-Bulgarian mission in 1988, and
space rookie Balandin were to link up with the Mir orbital platform
on Tuesday. They will relieve two fellow Soviets, Alexander
Viktorenko and Alexander Serebrov, who were launched Sept. 5 and
are in their sixth month in orbit.
   Under Gorbachev, pressures have increased on the country's once
sacrosanct space program to prove its usefulness to the
shortage-plagued economy. Some lawmakers have even demanded big
funding cuts, saying the nation cannot afford costly space missions
when it cannot guarantee citizens a reliable supply of meat and
potatoes.
   However, the six-month mission undertaken by Solovyov and
Balandin has been noisily billed by state-run media as a
moneymaker. The spacemen are to put to use the new Kristall module,
described by the government daily Izvestia as the first
mini-factory for the manufacture of technological and
biotechnological materials in zero-gravity conditions.
   Through use of Kristall, which is to be shot into orbit March 30
for linkup with Mir, up to $41 million of profit are forecast, the
official Tass news agency said. ``For the first time in Soviet
cosmonautics, incomes from the flight are expected to exceed by far
spending on the spaceship's launch,'' it proclaimed.
   The cosmonauts will melt crystals and exploit conditions of
weightlessness to manufacture super-pure semi-conductor materials
for science and technology, Tass said. ``Factories that placed
their orders with the cosmonauts are waiting impatiently to put
them to use,'' it added.
   Other moneymaking ventures for the cosmonauts are
bio-engineering experiments and photographing the Earth's surface.
Part of the bio-engineering program was developed with the help of
U.S. scientists, Tass said, adding it showed how superpower
cooperation in space is growing.
   While there was no way to audit the huge profits claimed for the
Soyuz TM-9 mission by Tass, the accent on profitability was in
keeping with the new realities the Soviet space program is
experiencing under Gorbachev.
   When Viktorenko and Serebrov were launched in September, their
three-stage booster rocket was festooned with an advertisement
bought by Generali, an Italian insurance company, and ads for a
Soviet electronics firm and ``New Dawn'' perfume, a Soviet scent,
were prominently displayed at the launch pad.
   Likewise, the Soviets opened up another once-secret spaceport,
Plesetsk, to foreigners in September, courting clients from West
Germany, France and other Western countries by offering cut-rate
prices to place payloads in orbit.
   However, the mission that began Sunday was the first under the
shift of Soviet space research to the ``profit-and-loss''
accounting system imposed by the Kremlin on factories and farms,
Tass said. Space missions used to be paid for from a central fund,
but the Soyuz TM-9 mission is financed by state-run enterprises and
organizations that seek some benefit from it, for example by
testing technology or conducting experiments, Tass said.
   The Soviet space shuttle Buran, launched on its maiden unmanned
mission in November 1988, has drawn the most fire from Soviet space
critics, with even Roald Z. Sagdeev, former chief of the country's
space program, calling it a multibillion-ruble boondoggle built for
no good reason.
   But even the Mir, launched in 1986 as the chief building block
of a Soviet space station, has been caught in the economy drive.
The Mir, originally designed to be permanently manned, remained
empty for four months in 1989 to cut costs and give Soviet
scientists time to prepare modules like Kristall to be launched and
bolted to it.
   Alexei Leonov, deputy chief of the cosmonauts' training center,
told Tass this saved $25 million, but admitted some people question
that sum, thus also casting doubt on how the fabulous profits for
the mission that began Sunday were figured.
   Viktorenko and Serebrov are to return to Earth Feb. 19. During
their mission on Mir, they tested a ``space motorcycle'' designed
to recover satellites or recover spacemen in distress.

<HEAD>Iranians Mark Revolution's Anniversary Without Khomeini</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five million Iranians thronged Tehran's
snow-covered Freedom Square on Sunday to mark the Islamic
Revolution's 11th anniversary. Speakers urged them to continue
their fight against the United States.
   Leaders had worried that the anniversary celebration, the first
since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death in June, would be poorly
attended.
   But Tehran television, monitored in Nicosia, said people in the
massive crowd carried portraits of Khomeini, who launched the
revolution, and banners pledging allegiance to his successor,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
   Khomeini, known as the imam, returned in triumph to Tehran on
Feb.1, 1979, after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi left the country. Ten
days later, the shah's government collapsed and the Islamic
Republic was proclaimed.
   The television said the crowds began massing in Azadi, or
Freedom, Square on the capital's western outskirts soon after dawn,
even though temperatures had not climbed above zero. The report
showed aerial shots of a wave of people converging on the square
and footage of crowds chanting ``Death to America!''
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the square and
surrounding streets were ``so packed that it was difficult to move
even a few inches.''
   During the festivities, Khamenei declared a conditional amnesty
for all prisoners to celebrate the anniversary, the television
said. But it did not say how many prisoners were included or under
what conditions.
   Iranian officials, fearful Khomeini's death might have dampened
the revolutionary zeal of the people, had urged Iranians to join
Sunday's rally.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani, addressing the crowd, thanked them
for turning out.
   ``This sea of united, informed and righteous people, who today
have packed this square on the first anniversary of the revolution
without our great imam, is the best and most telling demonstration
of the ... strength of the revolution and the commitment of the
people to abide by the teachings of the imam,'' he was quoted as
saying.
   Reasserting Khomeini's vehemently anti-American stand, Ayatollah
Ahmad Jannati said, ``This people will never abandon their fight
against the United States ... and are determined to continue
treading the late imam's path,'' according to IRNA.
   Jannati heads the Islamic Propagation Organization, which
publishes and distributes books, periodicals and other material
promoting the Iranian revolution abroad.
   Criticizing the United States, which strongly supported the
shah, became a cornerstone of the Islamic Revolution.
   The anti-American feelings among Khomeini's followers boiled
over when Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in
November 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. Relations
have been broken ever since.
   Although pragmatic leaders such as Rafsanjani have been working
to improve Iran's radical image to attract Western investment and
technology, spritual leaders have held fast to Khomeini's legacy.
   Exporting the Islamic Revolution abroad, one of Khomeini's main
goals, failed during Iran's eight-year war with Iraq. Most Arab
nations, ruled by Sunni Moslems, distrust the Shiite Moslem clergy
running Persian Iran.
   Iran did, however, win many followers among the more than 1
million Shiites in Lebanon, where Iran's partisans of Hezbollah, or
Party of God, are battling the Syrian-backed Amal movement. Shiite
Moslem extremists loyal to Iran are holding 18 Western hostages in
Lebanon, including eight Americans.
   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Young West German men begin
cruising into this East German border town early in the evening,
seeking romance in a land where the sight of a BMW can win smiles
from young women but snarls from local males.
   The opening of the German border did not only change history. It
has changed mating rituals as well.
   ``The guys from over there (West Germany) are a lot less
inhibited than the ones over here,'' said Conni, 18, who lives in
Saalfeld. ``And these cars they have, they're just incredible.''
   West German visitors have been flooding into East Germany by the
tens of thousands since the borders were opened last year.
   Many are tourists, coming to see famous sights like the elegant
Sans Souci palace of Friedrich the Great in Potsdam, the historic
city of Weimar, or the lakes and haunting forest areas near the
Polish border.
   Many West Germans also load up their Mercedes and BMWs to go
visit their poorer, Trabant-driving relatives to the East.
   The open borders have opened up new romantic possibilities as
well.
   One prestigious West German newspaper, Die Zeit, called the
phenomenon ``reunification of the flesh.''
   From Schwerin in the north to Plauen in the south, young West
Germans in their flashy BMWs, sleek Mercedes and souped-up Audis
cruise into East German communities. There have been numerous
reports of East German women giving up everything at home and
running off with the West German men.
   But not every cross-border foray is a success.
   Guenter Kantzner and three friends drove an Audi GT from their
Bavarian village across the border to Saalfeld late one Friday
night.
   ``Some guys think when they come over here, they'll be treated
like kings,'' said Kantzner, standing in front of a bar rumored to
offer good chances for meeting young East German women.
   For Kantzner and his friends, however, the first visit to
Saalfeld was a decided letdown.
   There wasn't a single unescorted woman in the Saalfeld bar. In
fact, there were only about 10 people there. After about 30
uneventful minutes Kantzner and his friends went back to Bavaria.
   Some East German men get annoyed by the invasion of the
``Wessies'' with their flashy automobiles.
   But Henrich Viebach, a 17-year-old Saalfelder, opts for a more
philosophical view.
   ``I know a number of girls who went over to the West after
meeting boys from over there,'' said Viebach. ``But I don't see
anything wrong with it. If I were in their shoes, I'd do the same
thing.''
   The cross-border traffic has raised fears that West Germany's
AIDS and drugs problems will take root and flourish in East Germany.
   ``Never has a border stopped a virus. It always comes through,''
said Niels Soennichsen, an AIDS adviser for the East German
government, after the borders were opened last November.
   Some Saalfeld residents say they've heard of drugs showing up on
their side of the border, but West German border guards and East
German customs officials in the area insist that so far there have
been no problems.
   The continuous flow of West German cars into East Germany proves
the tourists must be enjoying themselves.
   East Germany still lacks the often gaudy commercialism of the
West, and parts of the country have retained the rustic beauty that
used to be Germany's trademark.

<TEXT>
   California Democrats are waging a
bruising primary campaign for governor this year, while Republicans
have united behind a moderate, low-profile senator who just a
decade ago was a reviled party outcast.
   The three candidates for governor in the June 5 primary are
Republican Pete Wilson, who served 11 years as mayor of San Diego
before his 1982 election to the U.S. Senate, and Democrats Dianne
Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco, and state Attorney
General John Van de Kamp.
   Republican Gov. George Deukmejian is retiring after two terms.
   The major issues so far in the race include abortion, ethics,
the death penalty, education and managing the problems spawned by
California's explosive growth.
   Wilson formally kicked off his campaign Sunday with a series of
tough-talking anti-crime speeches in which he stressed his support
of the death penalty and proposed a no-bail policy for accused drug
kingpins.
   ``I am outraged that 12 years after the people of California
made it the law of the state, the death penalty has not been
enforced,'' he said. He also called for limits on appeals in death
penalty cases.
   Abortion is an unlikely issue for this race, since all three
candidates are pro-choice. But some odd twists have brought it into
the campaign.
   One is Van de Kamp's contention that a victims'-rights
initiative supported by Wilson and Feinstein inadvertently would
repeal privacy laws which are the foundation of key pro-choice
court rulings.
   Another is Feinstein's assertion that while men may support
women's rights on abortion, a pro-choice woman will never
compromise on that issue.
   All three candidates stress similar quality-of-life themes,
covering all of the problems caused by California's population
growth, from crowded schools and traffic gridlock to overloaded
waste disposal systems and other environmental concerns.
   All three are cautious, experienced politicians, and they all
come frlom affluent, influential families.
   Wilson's father was an executive for a large advertising agency,
Feinstein's was a San Francisco surgeon, and Van de Kamp's family
name is on one of Southern California's best known bakery chains as
well as a frozen food label.
   But any similarities have been overshadowed by the intensity
with which each has magnified narrow differences or attacked the
others' records.
   Feinstein, who trails substantially in the polls and
fund-raising, has received the least criticism. But her nine-year
record as mayor of San Francisco has been attacked because of the
$179 million deficit she left her successor.
   Wilson and Van de Kamp both have been tarnished by their
peripheral roles in the collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association _ Wilson for accepting $16,500 in contributions from
Lincoln president Charles Keating, and Van de Kamp for allegedly
letting his Justice Department block another state agency's order
to halt Lincoln's sale of what later proved to be worthless bonds.
   Van de Kamp has also criticized Wilson for the speaking
honorariums he has accepted as a senator, while Feinstein and
Wilson have hammered at Van de Kamp's failure while Los Angeles
district attorney to prosecute a suspect later convicted in the
Hillside Strangler murder case.
   Beyond the flurry of charges, other anomalies abound in the race.
   Wilson, 56, arrived at the enviable position of being unopposed
in the Republican primary by an unlikely route that involved luck
and deft political maneuvering.
   Since he entered politics in 1967 in the state Assembly, Wilson
has been distrusted by conservatives for his aggressive advocacy of
growth-management and environmental-protection policies and his
moderate stands on social issues.
   Wilson, almost alone among California Republicans, opposed
Ronald Reagan's 1976 campaign for president and went to New
Hampshire on behalf of then-President Ford to contradict Reagan's
account of his governorship.
   Reagan narrowly lost New Hampshire's leadoff primary and later
lost the nomination by a handful of delegates, and many California
Republicans blamed Wilson.
   In 1978, Wilson ran for the Republican nomination for governor,
finishing a dismal fourth with only 9 percent of the vote.
   His endorsement of Reagan in 1980 took some of the edge off the
conservative animosity, and Wilson became the surprise winner of
the 1982 Republican primary for U.S. Senate when the campaign of
the conservative front-runner, Barry Goldwater Jr., collapsed,
leaving conservatives to choose between Wilson and a GOP moderate
they disliked even more, then-Rep. Pete McCloskey.
   Wilson was again the none-of-the-above alternative in the
general election, facing outgoing Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown as
Brown's popularity was at its nadir.
   But Wilson won re-election on his own in 1988, building a
moderate record in tune with California's political mainstream.
   Only two small organized groups, upset about Wilson's gay-rights
and abortion stands, have publicly opposed him, and their attempt
to draft former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth to run
against Wilson fizzled.
   Although Van de Kamp, 54, is California's chief prosecutor, he
is the only opponent of the death penalty in the race, putting him
at odds with 80 percent of California's voters.
   Feinstein, 56, has the highest nationwide name identification
and the most charismatic presence of the three candidates. But
until recent months, she has never been active in Democratic Party
affairs outside of San Francisco, and is only beginning to build a
statewide network of supporters.

<HEAD>Mass Exodus Reported Under Way in Liberia As Army Moves Against
Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Over 100,000 Liberians have fled to
neighboring countries in recent weeks to escape an army campaign to
put down a Libyan-backed rebellion, according to U.S. officials.
   Some official estimates say as many as 140,000 have left the
West African country, with a majority going to Ivory Coast and the
remainder to Guinea.
   One U.S. official attributed the exodus to excesses by both
government forces and the rebels. But Andrew Natsios, director of
the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, said the Army was
chiefly responsible.
   ``The behavior of the Army has been very disturbing,'' Natsios
said in an interview last week. ``It is primarily the Army that is
causing the movement of people.''
   He called the Army a ``major cause of human rights abuses.''
   One official, citing the testimony of refugees, said Army troops
are arresting all young men in the conflict area and some are being
shot.
   But another U.S. official, who like the first spoke only on
condition of anonymity, said the flight of the Liberians was based
more on rumors of danger than on actual abuses.
   The State Department said at the end of January that U.S.
military officers, acting at the request of Liberian officials, had
stepped in to stop abuses by the government troops.
   Liberia, a nation of less than 2 million population, was founded
a century and half ago by freed American slaves.
   The United States and Liberia historically have had close ties
but the relationship over the past decade has been strained because
of repeated allegations of rights abuses and corruption by the
government of President Samuel K. Doe.
   Liberian authorities said rebel troops fighting Doe's government
killed about 200 people since the fighting began in the eastern
part of the country on Dec. 24.
   Africa Watch, a U.S.-based human rights group, said government
forces killed at least 200 civilians while searching the
countryside for rebels.
   Western diplomats in the Ivory Coast capital of Abidjan said
last week government troops had killed 500 civilians since the
fighting began.
   U.S. officials insisted that Libya was behind the rebellion but
they gave no details about that country's precise role. The
officials said Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has backed
insurrections in about a dozen countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
   According to Natsios, the plight of the Liberians who fled has
been made easier by the welcome they have received in the Ivory
Coast and Guinea by their tribal kinfolk. Most Liberian Army
officers are from a different tribe.
   The U.S. ambassadors in all three countries have released a
total of $75,000 for emergency needs, but Natsios reported that the
refugees generally are in good shape. He estimated the number of
displaced persons inside Liberia at between 2,000 and 3,000.
   The Rome-based World Food Program announced last week it is
giving $910,000 worth of food to Liberian refugees outside the
country.
   In addition, the State Department may send a team of experts to
the region to assess conditions.

<TEXT>
   President Lee Teng-hu was unanimously
endorsed Sunday by the governing Nationalist Party as its
presidential candidate, virtually assuring him of a six-year-term.
   Lee's choice of a top personal aide as vice presidential nominee
also received the backing of the party, although it angered many
elderly conservatives who would have preferred the post go to
Chiang Wego, son of the late Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek.
   The 74-year-old Chiang Wego, an army general, is
secretary-general of the National Security Council.
   All 180 members of the Nationalist Party's Central Committee
stood up to approve Lee, the 66-year-old former vice president who
succeeded President Chiang Ching-kuo when he died in office in
January 1988.
   His tenure as president has been marked by policies designed to
strike a balance between the conservative Old Guard of the party
and an increasingly restless population clamoring for more freedom.
   The National Assembly, or electoral college, is expected to
approve Lee's nomination at a meeting March 20.
   The committee later unanimously supported Lee's candidate for
vice president, Li Yuan-zu, a former justice minister who is now
secretary-general to the president.
   Although Lee was assured of the nomination, there was intense
speculation over whom he would propose for vice president. Aging
conservatives and younger reformers who have differed widely over
the pace of democratic change lobbied hard to influence the
decision.
   Lee, 66, the first native Taiwanese to head the party and
government, appeared to be staking out his independence with the
nomination of Li.
   In a speech to the convention, Lee tried to reassure both the
Old Guard and reformers that he had their interests at heart.
   He urged convention delegates to unite and continue the
democratization process initiated by Chiang Ching-kuo, who in 1987
lifted martial law that was first imposed by his father, Chiang
Kai-shek, 38 years earlier.
   ``We are facing rising demands from the public and keen
competition from the opposition party,'' Lee said. ``We need to
review related constitutional problems so we can create more room
for further progress.''
   The Nationalist Party lost several key local seats in Taiwan's
first multiparty general elections in December as the public vented
displeasure at the slow pace of reforms to dismantle a political
system that perpetuates Nationalist rule.
   Lee also reasserted the party's commitment to seek reunification
with China, a demand of the old guard politicians who fled to
Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek in 1949 after losing a civil war to
Communist forces on the Chinese mainland.
   ``A new opportunity is created for our reunification with China
as Communist regimes in the world are facing the destiny of
outright collapse if they do not introduce drastic changes,'' Lee
said.
   ``Our utmost task is to unite all anti-Communist forces to
topple the Chinese Communist tyranny,'' he added.
   Li, the vice presidential nominee, is from the Chinese mainland
but that does not appear to have enthused the aging mainland-born
conservatives who dominate the National Assembly.
   Although the aging Nationalists are uncomfortable with Lee, many
fear a popular uprising against the party if he is not elected.
Opinion polls have found his public approval rating to be more than
80 percent.
   The aging assembly members, who occupy 658 seats, were elected
before 1949 and were frozen in office to support the Nationalist
claim to be the sole legitimate rulers of all China. The remaining
assemblymen are Taiwan-elected members and Nationalist-appointed
members representing overseas Chinese.
   Lee has encouraged retirement among the elderly in the National
Assembly and the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's legislature which also
is dominated by aging conservatives. So far, few have accepted the
handsome pensions offered for voluntary retirement.

   The Duchess of York visited her stepfather
Sunday in a Manhattan cancer hospital.
   Argentine businessman Hector Barrantes, 51, at a patient in the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Hospital officials said no
information would be given about his condition.
   The duchess, who is eight months pregnant, visited the hospital
for about an hour Sunday along with her mother, Susan.
   The 29-year-old duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, arrived in
New York Saturday afternoon. The duchess is the wife of Prince
Andrew, second son of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.
   Barrantes reportedly was flown to New York earlier in the week
from his native Argentina.
   Her parents divorced when she was 14 and her mother then married
Barrantes, a onetime professional polo player. They live in
Argentina. He still raises polo ponies and is active on the
international polo circuit.

<HEAD>After 27 Years In Prison, Mandela Meets Expectations</HEAD>

   His face is weathered and his
hair is gray, but Nelson Mandela's voice still booms with the
confidence of a man who never seems to have doubted the justice of
his cause during decades in prison.
   The prison years have left their mark physically, but Mandela's
spirit still belongs to the young man who stubbornly protested the
inequities of apartheid.
   ``I come before you not as a prophet but as a humble servant of
the people,'' Mandela told tens of thousands of cheering supporters
Sunday after his release following 27 years in jail.
   ``I ... place the remaining years of my life in your hands,'' he
said.
   Mandela has clearly lost weight since the 1960s; both his face
and his body are leaner than when he was a sturdily built boxer
decades ago. At 71, his face is creased with two thick lines that
frame his strong, confident smile.
   His full head of hair is mostly gray, with a distinctive patch
of white on the right side. His voice is full and strong, and he
speaks like the lawyer he is, in slow, measured sentences.
   Despite his age, Mandela's walk is smooth and graceful, and he
appears extremely fit, the result of a two-hour daily exercise
regimen that reportedly begins each morning at 3:30.
   In his first public appearance he was dignified, courteous and
polite. In a well-cut suit, he looked much more a politician than a
guerrilla leader.
   Nonetheless, his elderly appearance probably came as a surprise
to many South Africans, the majority of whom were born after
Mandela was last seen publicly in 1964.
   Pictures of him as a vigorous African National Congress leader
in his 40s have been widely circulated in recent years. Hundreds of
people at the rally wore T-shirts with that youthful visage
emblazoned on the front.
   Mandela's reserved, even formal demeanor is likely to work in
his favor among whites, who have long been flooded with government
propoganda portraying him and the ANC as a communist-led terrorist
group.
   President F.W. de Klerk and his government now say Mandela is
committed to a peaceful resolution of the South African conflict,
and like the blacks, have invested considerable hope that Mandela
can succeed in bringing people together where others have failed.
   But Mandela stands firm on his commitment to a one-man, one-vote
democracy, a system the government rejects.
   ``I have fought against white domination. I have fought against
black domination,'' said Mandela. ``A united, non-racial democracy
in South Africa is the only way to peace.''

   About 1,000 demonstrators tried to
surge across a cease-fire line into Indian-held Kashmir on Sunday,
and state-run television said Indian forces opened fire, killing
six people.
   The Defense Ministry spokesman said Pakistan army patrols turned
back most of the protesters but that small groups slipped into
Indian-held territory. He said only three people were killed and
four wounded.
   The incident occurred near a small village of Chaukoti, about
100 miles north of Islamabad. It came as India is cracking down on
Moslem militants conducting a violent secessionist campaign in
Indian-held Kashmir.
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the region. A
portion of Kashmir valley is under Pakistani control, and an
840-mile cease-fire line monitored by the United Nations separates
Pakistani and Indian troops.
   The Kashmir region is predominantly Moslem, while India is
mostly Hindu.
   India again accused Pakistan on Sunday of aiding the Moslem
secessionist campaign centered in Srinagar, India, where a curfew
remained in effect Sunday.
   Pakistan has accused India of ``ruthlessness'' in suppressing
the secessionists and of trying to divert international attention
by blaming Pakistan for what it has called an ``indiginous freedom
movement.''
   Pakistan television reported Sunday that Indian border guards
killed six people and arrested four. The television quoted the
prime minister of Pakistan-held Kashmir, Sikander Hayat Khan in its
report.
   Press Trust of India said Indian border guards fired in the air
first, then into the crowd when it continued to surge forward. The
Indian report, which quoted an unidentified Indian government
spokesman, did not mention casualties.
   The Pakistani ministry spokesman, who requested anonymity, said
his nation's soldiers repulsed all but a few small groups of the
demonstrators.
   ``We and the Indians are very clear that this is a local
trouble. It's very difficult to blame anyone, whether they fired in
self-defense or not,'' he said of the Indian border guards.
   India's High Commissioner to Pakistan, J.N. Dixit, told The
Associated Press he had not heard of any disturbance along the
cease-fire line.
   ``This is news to me. I have no information,'' he said. ``I
would have heard at least one or two hours after it happened.''
   Pakistan's state-run news agency said Islamabad asked Dixit ``to
convey a sense of shock to the Indian authorities in New Delhi and
also impress upon them the need to exercise utmost restraint in
dealing with armed civilians.''
   The demonstration at the border was one of many in Pakistan
Sunday marking the sixth anniversary of the death of Maqbool Butt,
a militant Kashmir leader. Butt was hanged for the 1965 murder of
an Indian intelligent agent in Kashmir.
   Scores of people have been killed in a 2-month-old secessionist
uprising in Indian-held Kashmir. It has been led by Moslem
militants demanding separation from India and either independence
or union with Pakistan.
   On Feb. 5, Indian border guards killed a 12-year-old boy when
Pakistanis stormed the border near Sialkot, 125 miles southeast of
Islamabad.

   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner emerged
Sunday from talks with President Bush to suggest that a reunified
Germany could be a part of the Western alliance without extending
NATO's military reach over the territory that is now East Germany.
   Woerner said a way can and will be found to keep a united
Germany in NATO while recognizing ``the legitimate security
interests of the Soviet Union.''
   Following two days of talks at the presidential retreat at Camp
David, Md., both Bush and Woerner hailed what the White House
called West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ``extraordinarily
successful'' talks with Soviet leaders in Moscow.
   Kohl said Saturday he got ``unequivocal'' assurances from Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev that Moscow would respect the right of
the two Germanys to decide for themselves on the timing and
structure of their reunification.
   The White House said Bush and Woerner agreed that NATO ``should
adopt new political roles,'' including helping shape U.S. policies
toward the East Bloc nations now shifting toward democracy.
   Woerner spoke with reporters at Andrews AFB outside Washington
before boarding a U.S. Air Force jet to Ottawa, Canada, and an
international conference on ``open skies'' _ including Bush's
proposal to allow the superpowers to conduct surveillance flights
over each other's territories.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III also was bound for Ottawa
on Sunday following his six-day trip to Moscow and Eastern Europe.
At a news conference in Moscow on Friday night Baker had said U.S.
policy calls for full German membership in NATO or ``association''
with the alliance for a reunited Germany.
   A senior administration official later clarified that remark,
saying full NATO membership still was the only administration goal
for a reunified Germany
   Both Baker and the official endorsed a proposal by West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher that while a united Germany
should be a NATO member, Western troops would not move into the
territory that is now East Germany.
   The United States and its NATO allies want a unified Germany to
be a part of the Western military alliance that they view as a
cornerstone of four decades of peace in Europe.
   ``I personally would like to see a unified Germany remain a
member of NATO,'' said Woerner, ``but of course we have to take
into account the legitimate security interests of the Soviet
Union.''
   ``We can and will find solutions which guarantees these security
interests of the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   One of the possibilities, he said, is ``not to extend the
military integration of NATO towards the former region of the
German Democratic Republic (now East Germany), and this could be
done without problems. But the whole of Germany could and should
remain a member of NATO.''
   ``This is a solution which would not create any problems,'' said
Woerner.
   Asked if he had in mind a neutral section of Germany, Woerner
said, ``We are not considering a neutral Germany or even a neutral
East Germany.''
   He declined to discuss further details, saying, ``This is a
solution which has to be found and which has to be discussed. Too
much speculation about details leads nowhere.''
   Woerner, who spoke in English, added, ``I think it's now the
task of all governments concerned to find a solution which allows
Germany to be embedded in Western structures, European integration,
Atlantic alliance, with additional all-European framework, the CSCE
process and with solutions which take into account the legitimate
security interests of the Soviet Union.''
   On ABC-TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley,'' Gennadi
Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said, ``Our
position is that it's for the Germans to decide what to do next. If
they want a reunited Germany, it's their decision.''
   But he added, ``they must take into account the specific
position of Germany, our specific relationship with the German
Democratic Republic, and our security concerns, and even our
psychological concerns, because we still have memories of that
dreadful, terrible war we had with Germany.''
   ``For many people in my country, it's difficult to understand
that we are going to have a big Germany again as our neighbor,''
said Gerasimov, who added that a reunited Germany ``must not upset
stability in Europe.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee,
said Germany must remain a vital part of the Western alliance,
though there have been hints that West Germany should take a
modified role in NATO a part of reunification with East Germany.
   ``I've just been told that a number of the East German army
people are coming over and wanting to join the West German army,''
Nunn said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''
   ``You're going to have a merged type army there over a period of
time _ I don't know how long. But, you can't have a political and
economic union and have two separate armies.''
   John Herrick, an assistant White House spokesman, said Bush and
Woerner ``expressed their gratification that the government of the
Federal Republic of Germany had affirmed that a unified Germany
would remain a member of the North Atlantic Alliance.''
   ``They agreed that NATO, in addition to maintaining the common
defense, should adopt new political roles _ in helping guide
Western policy toward the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe,
in coordinating the negotiation and monitoring of arms control
agreements, and in developing Western policy for regional and
trans-national issues.''
   Kohl will be Bush's guest at Camp David on Feb. 24-25.

   White police officers and black
activists worked together Sunday to ensure the safety of Nelson
Mandela as he walked out of prison.
   Security was tight throughout the day with hundreds of heavily
armed police keeping watch at the prison and guarding Mandela's
route. Police were aided by volunteer marshalls from anti-apartheid
groups.
   But the heavy security did not prevent violence in central Cape
Town, where police clashed with rampaging young blacks who smashed
shop windows. Doctors and journalists said more than 100 people
were injured and there were reports of deaths.
   Black activists, and policemen who may once have arrested them
worked with each other in some cases to hold back the crowds and
ensure Mandela's safety.
   Winnie Mandela, who has endured midnight police raids on her
home, had an escort of three motorcycle officers riding ahead of
her motorcade to Victor Verster prison, where her husband was
released.
   However, when Mandela and his wife got into a car to leave the
prison, seucrity broke down. Some eager witnesses to history
surrounded the car and nearly climbed atop it.
   Police lined Mandela's route to Cape Town while volunteers held
hands against the crowd to keep the streets clear. Police
helicopters hovered overhead.
   But after police and young black youths began fighting, angry
men and women formed chains around City Hall to protect Mandela and
mauled anyone who tried to pass. Police had to negotiate their way
through the chain to get to their superiors inside the building.
   ``The police may be inside, but we are in charge of the door!''
one black man in a khaki uniform with ANC-colored shoulder patches
shouted.

   Young blacks and nervous white
policemen turned celebration to chaos Sunday at the welcoming rally
for Nelson Mandela on his first day of freedom.
   Tens of thousands of people had gathered hours before the rally,
hoping for a glimpse of the black leader who was released after 27
years in jail for fighting the white minority government.
   But as the sun set, there were no longer the shouts of ``Viva
Mandela'' and the energetic singing of the morning, but shotgun
fire, police helicopters criss-crossing the sky, ambulances
wailing, police dogs barking and black youths chanting, pounding
their feet and issuing angry challenges.
   The center of the city called ``the fairest Cape'' was a
battlefield.
   Thousands of blacks and whites stood in the huge parade ground,
eyes fixed on the City Hall balcony, listening to endless political
speeches over defective loudspeakers, waiting for Mandela to appear.
   They waited even though they could hear, at the edges of the
throng, the shop windows shattering and the intermittent gunshots.
   As the 71-year-old prisoner, free for just two hours, was driven
in a motorcade past streets lined with tens of thousands of people,
the first shots rang out near the railway station.
   Bands of youths had broken shop windows earlier in the day, and
police who came to investigate were taunted by a crowd that
outnumbered them six to one. They guarded the shop but did not draw
their guns.
   But later, when people began shattering the outer windows of a
shopping plaza across the street from the parade ground, four
policemen appeared in the middle of the street and began firing
shotguns at the black youths.
   The youths fought back, hurling broken bottles that soon made a
shard-covered no-man's land.
   The youths stood on the edge of the crowd, or hid behind cars
and buildings with makeshift wooden and metal weapons. Many tried
to blend in or stand in front of the bystanders.
   On a side street, women and children were watching a momentary
standoff. Suddenly, a blue-uniformed officer wheeled around, aimed
his shotgun toward the crowd and fired three times.
   Some of the onlookers screamed and ran, but most fell down on
the pavement. Some tried to hide behind a car, but the driver drove
away.
   As the terrified women looked up to see why they had been made
targets, they saw thin, young boys, in dirty T-shirts and shorts,
scamper past them, laughing.
   But there were peacemakers on both sides.
   Ordinary folk, black and white, formed a human chain around a
makeshift first aid center in the street near city hall. Each time
shots rang out, they crouched to the ground, but they never broke
their lines.
   When hooligans smashed into Indian-owned snack shops on the edge
of the parade ground, a young black man raised the ANC flag to
protect the white policemen who came to stand guard in front of the
shops.
   The young man's colleagues formed a wall with their bodies to
hold back scores of young radicals who were itching to get at the
policemen.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said Sunday
she will refuse to meet Defense Secretary Dick Cheney during his
visit next week following criticism of her administration by U.S.
officials and media.
   Mrs. Aquino also said Filipino officials will demand an
explanation for cuts in promised U.S. economic aid when the two
governments begin talks soon on extending the lease on six American
military bases, which expires in 1991.
   Cheney is expected here next Sunday for three days of talks and
visits to Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay naval base, the largest
of the six installations.
   No schedule of meetings had been announced. But Mrs. Aquino
routinely receives prominent Americans, and her refusal to see a
U.S. official of Cheney's rank is unprecedented for her
administration.
   Cheney left Washington on Saturday for Hawaii before flying on
later to South Korea, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan. In
Honolulu, Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said Cheney's
schedule had not been ``nailed down'' and ``it's unsure whether
we'll see Mrs. Aquino or not.''
   During her weekly national radio program, Mrs. Aquino complained
about U.S. media reports following visits last month by deputy
national security adviser Robert Gates and Republican Rep. Jim
Kolbe of Arizona.
   ``I've been thinking that we talk of one thing and afterward,
something else is published in American newspapers,'' Mrs. Aquino
said.
   ``Because of our sad experience of the last two visits, I think
it is best that it be (Defense) Secretary (Fidel) Ramos who will
meet with his counterpart and (that he) does not need me at the
moment.''
   Mrs. Aquino also said her government considered Washington's
failure to provide promised economic and military aid to be a
violation of a 1988 agreement allowing the United States to
maintain its bases through the end of their lease.
   In October 1988, then Secretary of State George Shultz agreed to
pay $962 million over two years for use of the bases through 1991.
After that, a new agreement must be negotiated and ratified by the
U.S. and Philippine senates.
   This year, the Bush administration asked Congress to provide
$200 million in military assistance and $160 million in Economic
Support Funds for the Philippines.
   But Congress cut the figure by $96 million and U.S. diplomats in
Manila say there is no chance the reductions will be restored.
   Mrs. Aquino said the countries need to begin talks about the
bases and discuss ``the non-fulfillment of the commitments of the
Americans,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``We are waiting for them to explain
why this happened.''
   Strains in U.S.-Philippine relations have emerged despite Bush's
public support for Mrs. Aquino.
   On Dec. 1, U.S. Air Force jets flew air cover in support of
pro-government forces battling military mutineers trying to oust
Mrs. Aquino.
   But in the aftermath of the coup attempt, U.S. officials have
delivered some of the strongest public criticism of Mrs. Aquino's
administration since she took power in the February 1986 uprising
against the late Ferdinand Marcos.
   Last month, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Carl Ford told
the House subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific that the political
situation here remains ``unsettled'' and that many wondered whether
the government could regain public confidence.
   During the same hearing, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
David Lambertson warned of the danger of another coup attempt and
said corruption was hampering government operations.
   After a visit here last month, Rep. Kolbe told reporters in
Arizona that Mrs. Aquino favors retaining U.S. bases but is in a
``very awkward position'' politically because of others' opposition
to them.
   His comments were widely published in the Philippines.
Anti-bases groups claimed Mrs. Aquino had made a secret agreement
with the Americans while publicly stating she had not made up her
mind on the installations.

   Celebrated cellist and conductor Mstislav
Rostropovich, whose Soviet citizenship was restored in January
after 12 years of official disgrace, arrived in his homeland Sunday
to a jubilant VIP welcome.
   Rostropovich, accompanied by his wife, opera singer Galina
Vishnevskaya, received a tumultuous welcome at Sheremetevo Airport,
where hundreds of friends, fans and journalists gathered to meet
his flight from Tokyo.
   ``Welcome back, Welcome home!'' fans yelled as the couple was
escorted to the VIP lounge to be officially greeted by Soviet
Culture Minister Nikolai Gubenko and an entourage that included
U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock and French Culture Minister Jack Lang.
   ``It was like a welcome for a visiting head of state,'' said a
Soviet who watched the festivities and commented on condition of
anonymity.
   Rostropovich and his wife were driven away in separate black
Chaika limousines with a two-car police escort. Soviet television
news said they went immediately to pay their respects at the grave
of Dmitri Shostakovich, the celebrated Soviet composer who died in
1975 and was once in official disfavor under dictator Josef Stalin.
   The 62-year-old cellist, whose instrument accompanied him in a
white case, will perform concerts Tuesday and Wednesday at the
Moscow Conservatory with the National Symphony Orchestra of
Washington, D.C., and later give two concerts in Leningrad.
   On Monday, Rostropovich was to present health officials with 1
million single-use syringes to help in the anti-AIDS campaign.
Throwaway syringes are in notoriously short supply in the Soviet
Union.
   Rostropovich earned the Kremlin's wrath in the early 1970s by
giving refuge to author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose writings
depicted the brutal political repressions that began under Soviet
founder Vladimir Lenin and reached a bloody crescendo under Stalin.
   The maestro and his wife left the Soviet Union in 1974, the year
of his last public performance in Moscow, to live abroad. Four
years later, the Soviet government stripped the couple of their
citizenship for ``actions harmful to the prestige of the Soviet
Union.''
   In January, the Supreme Soviet legislature restored their
citizenship and nullified the decree that stripped them of all
their medals and honorary titles.
   Rostropovich gained international renown as a cello soloist and
conductor with the Moscow Philharmonic. Since his departure from
the Soviet Union, he has maintained homes in London, the United
States, Switzerland and France.
   In 1987, Queen Elizabeth II conferred a knighthood on him on his
60th birthday.
   Several other prominent Soviet cultural figures also have had
their lost citizenship restored in recent months amid the reforms
of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Solzhenitsyn is a notable exception; Soviet officials say they
have not received any application from him to have his citizenship
restored, although his works are now being published by official
media.
   The Nobel Prize-winning author, who lives in Vermont, was
stripped of his citizenship and expelled from the Soviet Union in
1974. The official Writers Union voted last year to restore his
membership.
   Alexei Yelisayev, chairman of the Supreme Soviet's Commission on
Citizenship, said in a December newspaper interview that exiled
Soviets who lost their citizenship could have it restored only if
they requested it.
   Yelisayev said it was not necessary for exiles to return to have
their citizenship restored.

<HEAD>IRA Claims it Shot Down Helicopter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gunfire forced an army
helicopter down near the border with the Irish Republic on Sunday,
police said, and an anonymous caller claimed the IRA shot it down.
   Three soldiers were taken to a hospital with injuries suffered
in a forced landing near the village of Clogher in County Tyrone, a
spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary said. None was thought
to be seriously hurt, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   There was gunfire, but it was not immediately known whether any
shots hit the Gazelle helicopter, which had been on a
reconnaissance flight, the spokesman said. He said the area was
sealed off and that an investigation was under way.
   A caller claiming to speak for the Irish Republican Army
telephoned the British Broadcasting Corp. with a claim that the IRA
shot the helicopter down.
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British out of the
predominantly Protestant province of Northern Ireland and unite it
with the Roman Catholic republic,
   A witness, speaking anonymously, said the aircraft had crashed.
``The helicopter went over the house very low, and a couple of
seconds later we heard the crash,'' said the woman, who lives near
the scene.
   ``There were shots a few minutes before _ 50 or 60 shots from a
machine gun,'' she said.
   In June 1988 a Lynx helicopter was knocked down by sustained IRA
gunfire at Forkhill, County Armagh.
   The IRA filmed a large team of men in open countryside tracking
the helicopter and firing at it with heavy and light machine guns.
They later released a video of the shooting.
   There have been fears among security officials that the IRA had
obtained SAM-7 missiles from Libya to target military flights. None
has been used to date and there was no suggestion one was used
Sunday.

<HEAD>Nunn Says Bush Needs Arms Control Architects, Not `Carpenters'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee criticized the Bush administration's arms control
position Sunday as being put together by ``carpenters rather than
architects,'' lacking a broad view.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the administration needs to take a
look at U.S. weapons systems as they relate to arms control and an
apparent willingness by the Soviets to disarm.
   ``It's going to be awfully hard for this administration to say
we've had a breakthrough in negotiating with the Soviets, we're
going to reduce arms by about 30 to 40 percent and then come up and
say we want two missiles _ two of them mobile; we want a new B-2
bomber; we want an SDI program to go forward full steam _ all of
these things at one time,'' Nunn said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press'' program.
   ``I don't think that's going to sell,'' he said.
   Nunn said Bush's armed forces modernization plans do not take
into account some of the possibilities in arms control, like
getting rid of the MX rail mobile missile in exchange for the
Soviet SS-24, which is also a based on railroad cars, and moving
toward a policy of no multiple-warhead missiles.
   ``Our arms control position is really being done by carpenters
rather than architects,'' he said. ``I don't think in Congress
there's going to be a lot of receptivity to going forward with huge
weapon systems unless there is a strategic concept that fits into
the arms control.''
   He also criticized the timing of Bush's appearance last week at
U.S. military war games in California and his comments in support
of the Strategic Defense Initiative at a time when the Soviet Union
was voting to reduce the power of the Communist Party.
   ``Well, these military exercises have to go on, but I did think
it was curious the president chose this moment in history to
participate in a war game and give it tremendous visibility,'' Nunn
said. ``I think that's somewhat out of sync with the events that
are taking place.''
   Nunn's comments came as Secretary of State James A. Baker III
was en route to Ottawa, Canada, for a NATO-Warsaw Pact ``open
skies'' conference on surveillance and other techniques for
exchanging military data between East and West.
   At the Ottawa conference, Baker was to continue discussions with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on troop reductions in
Europe and weapons cuts.
   The talks made progress last week while Baker was in Moscow,
when a near-agreement was reached between the United States and
Soviet Union on cuts in chemical weapons and long-range nuclear
missiles.
   If negotiations work out in Canada, the slight differences
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev on
troop cuts are expected to be smoothed out, setting the stage for
an agreement later this year between the NATO and Warsaw Pact
alliances to remove about 400,000 Soviet and 100,000 American
soldiers from Europe.
   The talks in Moscow produced an agreement that Bush and
Gorbachev would sign accord in June, providing for the destruction
of all their chemical weapons in 10 years _ if all other nations
capable of making poison gas sign a treaty.

   The solitude that fosters crooning in the
shower is helping University of Georgia students master their do,
re, mi's and shed their inhibitions about singing in public.
   Music professor David Smith uses an electronic voice analyzer in
a room that once was a restroom to help future elementary school
teachers overcome a lack of confidence in their singing abilities.
The voice laboratory still has a sink and soap dish, but other
toilet fixtures have been removed.
   Smith said the solitude of the laboratory is intentional, but
the fact that it's located in a former restroom is strictly the
result of space limitations.
   ``The activity itself is designed to be done in isolation so
that they would not be so self-conscious,'' he said. ``I would
assume singing in the shower might be the same thing, where they
would not have an audience to entertain.''
   Smith said students who are self-conscious about singing respond
much better to musical activities that give them feedback without
any human involvement.
   So an electronic device measures vocal performance digitally and
gives the students a score. A meter shows them whether they are
sharp or flat. It may not make opera singers out of them, but the
teachers-to-be learn to be more at ease and more effective in
leading youngsters in classroom singalongs, he said.
   ``Students can develop their skills in a fairly fun,
non-threatening way,'' he said. ``It has a subtle, video-game
approach.''

   Harold Kopp thought the candy bar he
bought at a shopping center was going to cost him $357 instead of
some loose change.
   The same afternoon, Dorothy Newmann returned home from the same
center $357 richer.
   But Kopp and Ms. Newmann found each other through a classified
ad and the money went back to his pocket, leaving both feeling
richer.
   ``I had just come out of the drug store,'' Kopp, 59, recounted
Saturday. ``I got my blood pressure taken, and I bought a candy
bar. I stopped for a minute to clean out my pocket ... and that's
when the money clip fell out.''
   Ms. Newmann, 57, found it Wednesday afternoon, but, as she puts
it, ``I could not keep it. It might be an elderly man.''
   Friday, she got the idea to check the classified section of The
Stuart News. There, she saw an ad placed by Kopp.
   ``We had run it already and I figured if no one saw it Thursday
it was hopeless. I was ready to kiss the money goodbye,'' Kopp
said. ``But my wife convinced me to run it one more day, so we did.
And that did it.''
   Ms. Newmann called the Kopps and arranged a meeting, at which
Kopp described the clip to her satisfaction. She handed it over.
   ``He kissed the money,'' Ms. Newmann said. Then he peeled off
three $20 bills from the clip and gave them to her.
   ``We had a grand old time,'' Kopp said.

<HEAD>Kaunda Urges ANC To Suspend Guerrilla Campaign</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Kenneth Kaunda Sunday urged the
African National Congress to suspend its guerrilla campaign in
South Africa following the release of ANC leader Nelson Mandela.
   But Kaunda, long one of the South African government's
staunchest critics, also said the ANC should maintain its military
capability in case of violence by white right-wing extremists in
South Africa.
   ``Until we know which way the ultra-rightists are going it is
important that the armed struggle should only be suspended, not
abolished,'' Kaunda told The Associated Press at his official
residence in Lusaka.
   ``Certainly, I think the ANC should suspend the armed struggle
for the moment but they should not be tempted to destroy their
armed forces,'' he said.
   Kaunda has allowed the ANC to base its exile headquarters and
guerilla facilities in Zambia and they have been targets of
sabotage and military attacks by South Africa.
   He also said he believed it was premature to lift international
economic sanctions before the United Nations discusses the South
African situation on June 30.
   ``That will be the time for all of us to look back at what de
Klerk will have done by way of establishing the root for abolishing
apartheid,'' said Kaunda, chairman of the six-nation African
Frontline bloc neighboring South Africa.
   Kaunda said he telephoned South African President F.W De Klerk
late Saturday to offer him his encouragement. He gave no other
details of their conversation, which took place a few hours after
De Klerk announced plans for Mandela's release Sunday.
   Kaunda said he believed the ANC should ``encourage De Klerk
along the path by talking.''
   ``The time for talking has come,'' he said.
   The ANC has said it will not end its guerrilla campaign in South
Africa or declare a unilateral cease-fire until several conditions
are met, including the government lifts the state of emergency,
releases all political prisoners and withdraws troops from black
townships.
   The organization has said it will not begin talks with the
government until the same conditions are met.
   Kaunda described the ANC's conditions as proper but did not
indicate whether he would try to persuade or pressure ANC leaders
to start talks.
   ``I support them fully but I think they should start talking now
even if it means a program of talks about talks,'' he said.
   Earlier Sunday, Zambian state radio quoted Lusaka-based ANC
secretary general Alfred Nzo as describing Mandela as ``the leader
of the ANC and all the people of South Africa.''
   Nzo called on all South Africans to support Mandela ``and join
hands in efforts to bring about justice and democracy'' in their
homeland.

   Former President Ronald Reagan, preparing to
testify by videotape in the trial of a former White House aide,
claimed a scheduling conflict Sunday in canceling a speech before
thousands of auto dealers.
   Reagan's aides cited no specifics other than a schedule problem
when they canceled the former president's appearance, said Mary
Beth Robinson, spokeswoman for the National Automobile Dealers
Association.
   Reagan's speech, which had been set for Tuesday, was to deliver
the keynote address during the final session of the group's annual
convention. NADA said Reagan would be replaced by three syndicated
columnists _ Hugh Sidey, Mark Shields and James J. Kilpatrick.
   Defense attorneys for former National Security Adviser John
Poindexter have subpoenaed Reagan's diaries for Poindexter's trial
on charges of obstructing Congress during an investigation into
arms sales to Contra forces in Nicaragua.
   A federal judge ordered Reagan to turn over some of the entries.
Reagan is resisting the subpoena by invoking executive privilege.
   On Friday, Reagan agreed to answer questions in videotape
testimony. That taping is to take place in Los Angeles on Friday,
four days before the scheduled start of Poindexter's trial.

<TEXT>
   Although most South African
blacks are jubilant over Nelson Mandela's release, his African
National Congress movement remains locked in bitter feuds with
major black factions to its left and right.
   Mandela himself is so revered that no black leader has said a
bad word about him in public.
   Yet the ANC, in whose name Mandela endured more than 27 years in
prison, is considered by some black-consciousness militants to be a
sellout, and by some black conservatives to be a power-hungry,
Marxist-influenced party.
   Within South Africa, black youths who have grown up with such
slogans as ``Freedom or death'' and waged street battles with
police may have trouble accepting the idea that talks have
precedence over armed struggle.
   ``For many of the youths, the struggle has simply meant to shoot
your way to Pretoria,'' anti-apartheid leader Murphy Morobe said
recently.
   The most influential of the ANC's black critics is Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, chief minister of the KwaZulu homeland and leader of
Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu organization that claims
1.5 million members. More than 2,500 blacks have died in a
three-year power struggle between Inkatha and ANC supporters in
Natal Province.
   Police said 12 blacks were killed in factional fighting in the
province on Sunday.
   Buthelezi depicts himself as a long-time foe of apartheid and an
old friend of Mandela, but he contends the ANC is unjustifiably
trying to claim the role as principal negotiator for the black
community.
   ``It was Inkatha's refusal to be co-opted into the ANC and its
refusal to become a subservient bag-carrier to the ANC that led to
the two organizations being in conflict,'' Buthelezi said after
Mandela's release was announced.
   ``There will be a conference table searching for the formula for
a multiparty democracy,'' Buthelezi added. ``Mandela will be there.
I will be there, the ANC will be there, Inkatha will be there.''
   Buthelezi said Mandela, more than any other black leader, has
the potential to put partisan interests aside and promote black
unity.
   One faction that is unlikely to join in negotiations is the Pan
Africanist Congress, which along with the ANC was banned in 1960
and legalized by President F.W. de Klerk earlier this month.
   The Pan Africanist Congress espouses black self-reliance and
contends that whites play too large a role in ANC-aligned groups.
It has criticized the ANC's increasing interest in negotiations,
saying black-white talks should take place only when the government
is ready to hand over political power and end white ownership of
the bulk of the country's land.
   Even within the ranks of ANC supporters, there is some division.
Commanders of its military wing reportedly were displeased last
year as relatively moderate members of the exiled leadership raised
the prospect of negotiations.
   Mandela has no formal position in the ANC at present, and his
future role is uncertain.
   The organization's president, Oliver Tambo, is recovering from a
stroke and possibly may be replaced later this year, but Mandela is
not expected to take that post. He may find himself trying to
balance his ANC duties with a broader role as leader of blacks
across the political spectrum.

   Amid the scenes of wild
jubilation over the release of Nelson Mandela on Sunday, there were
some ugly confrontations between jeering blacks and angry whites.
   Many whites looked worried or scared as they watched cheering
and singing blacks surging through parts of central Johannesburg.
Elegantly dressed whites shrank back as the black throngs danced
around them.
   While most people, black and white, were well-behaved, a handful
of blacks taunted whites, yelling ``Freedom is coming! Whites get
out!'' A few furious whites lashed out, hurling bottles and insults
at the blacks.
   In Cape Town, violence broke out about the time Mandela's
motorcade arrived.
   Police said a black looter was shot to death by officers, and
first-aid workers said more than 100 people were injured when riot
police fired shotguns after black youths smashed shop windows. Some
youths retaliated by hurling bottles.
   Clashes between police and celebrating blacks were reported in
at least two other areas, including the tribal homeland of Ciskei,
where hospital officials said police shot three people to death and
wounded 20.
   Police said 12 people were killed in Natal Province in factional
fighting between ANC supporters and backers of a more conservative
black group.
   For some South Africans, the scattered incidents of racial
tension were worrying signs of what might happen in the days ahead
when the government and anti-apartheid groups attempt to negotiate
over ending white rule. Many people in the crowds spoke of the need
for peace and understanding between the races.
   At the elegant Carlton shopping mall, three young black men
surrounded a young white couple, spitting on the frightened pair
and shaking fists at them. Other blacks intervened and chased the
taunters away.
   As blacks early Sunday surged through Hillbrow, near the city
center, some whites in apartments overlooking the street hurled
empty bottles at the celebrants. The marchers screamed insults and
shook their fists, but no injuries were seen.
   Frightened white motorists caught in the milling masses in the
streets leaned on their horns or scattered the crowds by driving at
high speed. Some clenched their fists in revolutionary salutes in
apparent attempts to placate hooting blacks.
   A white man watching the celebrants from his doorstep said,
``Look at them, look at them. What is happening to South Africa?''
   Some black youths pretended to fire imaginary machine guns at
police vans filled with white officers shadowing the celebrants.
Other blacks ran up to the vans, yelling ``Get out! Get out!''
   But much larger groups of blacks shouted ``Peace! Peace! Peace!''
   Most blacks and whites spoke of the need to solve South Africa's
problems peacefully. ``I pray to God we have peace in South
Africa,'' one black marcher said. ``We must all live together.''
   Leaders on both sides have expressed fears that white and black
extremists will provoke violence in the months ahead to try to
derail negotiations for their own ends. White extremists demand the
retention of white supremacy; some black militants oppose a
compromise with whites.
   ``I fear what is coming. It will be a terrible time, but we must
overcome it by working together,'' said the Rev. Allan Boesak, a
top anti-apartheid leader.

   Buster Douglas, a 29-year-old boxer from Columbus,
Ohio, knocked out Mike Tyson on Sunday in a world championship
heavyweight bout with no winner, no loser and a ``long count''
controversy.
   What a fight! Hours after underdog Douglas' 10th-round knockout,
the World Boxing Council and World Boxing Association suspended the
result pending investigation of a ``long count'' protest by Tyson's
promoter, Don King.
   Tyson, knocked out for the first time in his pro career, said
he's still the champion. ``I knocked him out before he knocked me
out,'' Tyson said.
   Douglas said he's champ: ``Just call it a victory for the small
man.''
   Douglas' father, former middleweight world contender Bill
``Dynamite'' Douglas, said: ``He pulled the greatest upset in
history.''
   Because of an error by referee Octavio Meyran, Douglas was on
the canvas for 12 seconds after Tyson knocked him down in the
eighth round. Two rounds later, Douglas knocked out Tyson with a
five-punch combination.
   ``There is no champion before Feb. 20,'' when the WBC meets in
Mexico City to settle the controversy, said WBC president Jose
Sulaiman of Mexico.
   Sulaiman suggested what course the two governing bodies might
take: ``When there are problems, a rematch is absolutely
mandatory,'' he said.
   Only the International Boxing Federation, which sanctioned the
bout as a championship match, said Douglas is the winner. The IBF,
however, isn't recognized by the Japan Boxing Commission.
   Douglas' disputed victory has created a wide-open heavyweight
division that for three years had been the personal domain of
Tyson, who was 37-0 with 33 knockouts.
   Tyson was scheduled to defend the title against No. 1 contender
Evander Holyfield on June 18 at Atlantic City, N.J., but Holyfield
has no contractual obligation to fight Tyson if Tyson is not the
heavyweight champion.
   ``There's nothing wrong with losing, I can handle a loss, but I
want to lose fairly,'' Tyson said at the post-fight news
conference, which Douglas did not attend.
   Douglas was felled in the eighth round by a right uppercut to
the jaw. ``I wasn't really hurt,'' Douglas said. ``When I looked up
the count was at six. I got up between seven and eight. I clearly
heard eight.''
   Douglas was upright at nine, but by then the timekeeper had
tolled 10, although Meyran _ who failed to pick up the timekeeper's
count _ didn't know that. He motioned for the two boxers to resume
fighting, then the bell rang.
   Contrary to the old saying, the bell cannot save a fighter. It
isn't rung if a fighter is down past the three-minute limit of the
round, but rings if a fighter beats the 10-count.
   Douglas hurt Tyson three or four times in the ninth round, and
by the end of the round, Tyson's left eye was closed.
   Just past the minute mark of the 10th round, Douglas landed a
five-punch combination, with the key blows being a right uppercut,
a left and a right to the jaw _ and Tyson went down and was counted
out.
   The most famous long count in boxing history took place in a
bout between Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney on Sept. 22, 1927, at
Chicago's Soldier Field before nearly 150,000 fans and a radio
audience of 50 million.
   The newly adopted knockdown rule required the standing fighter
to go to the farthest neutral corner before the count would start.
   After six rounds, Dempsey, seeking to regain the title he lost
to Tunney a year earlier, toppled his opponent with a barrage of
punches but went to the wrong corner, using up five seconds before
he moved to the proper corner.
   Fourteen seconds later, Tunny got up and went on to win a
unanimous decision for the 10-round fight. Said Dempsey: ``I was
robbed.''

   Confrontations between young
blacks and white policemen turned celebration to chaos Sunday at
the welcoming rally for Nelson Mandela on his first day of freedom.
   Tens of thousands had gathered hours before, hoping for a
glimpse of the black leader, who was released after 27 years in
jail for fighting the white-minority government.
   But as the sun set, cheers of ``Viva Mandela'' and the energetic
singing of the morning faded to new sounds.
   People heard shotgun fire, police helicopters crisscrossing the
sky, wailing ambulances, barking police dogs, and chanting black
youths, pounding their feet and issuing angry challenges.
   Police said officers fatally shot a black looter, and first-aid
workers said at least 100 people were injured when riot police
fired shotguns after groups of black youths smashed shop windows.
   The center of the city, called ``the fairest Cape,'' was a
battlefield.
   Thousands of blacks and whites stood in the huge parade ground,
their eyes fixed on the City Hall balcony as they listened to
endless political speeches over defective loudspeakers and waited
for Mandela to appear.
   They waited, even though they could hear, at the edges of the
throng, the shattering shop windows, the intermittent gunshots.
   As the 71-year-old prisoner, free for just two hours, was driven
in a motorcade past streets lined with tens of thousands of people,
the first shots rang out near the railway station.
   Bands of youths had broken shop windows earlier in the day, and
police who came to investigate were taunted by a crowd that
outnumbered them six to one. They guarded the shop but did not draw
their guns.
   But later, when people began shattering the outer windows of a
shopping plaza across the street from the parade ground, four
policemen appeared in the middle of the street and began firing
shotguns at the black youths.
   The boys fought back, hurling broken bottles that soon made a
shard-covered no-man's land.
   The youths stood on the edge of the crowd, or hid behind cars
and buildings, with makeshift wooden and metal weapons. Many tried
to blend in or stand in front of the bystanders.
   On a side street, women and children watched a momentary
standoff. Suddenly, a blue-uniformed officer wheeled, aimed his
shotgun toward the crowd and fired three times.
   Some of the onlookers screamed and ran, but most fell to the
pavement. Some tried to hide behind a car, but the driver drove
away.
   As the terrified women looked up to see why they had been made
targets, they saw thin, young boys, in dirty T-shirts and shorts,
scamper past them, laughing.
   But there were peacemakers on both sides.
   Ordinary folk, black and white, formed a human chain around a
makeshift first-aid center in the street near city hall. Each time
shots rang out, they crouched to the ground, but they never broke
their lines.
   When hooligans smashed into Indian-owned snack shops on the edge
of the parade ground, a young black man raised the ANC flag to
protect the white policemen who came to stand guard in front of the
shops.
   The young man's colleagues formed a wall with their bodies to
hold back scores of young radicals who wanted to get at the officer.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
Sunday gave moral support to opposition parties and a gentle
warning to the interim government, which has been accused of trying
to consolidate power prior to elections.
   During a 4{-hour stopover in Bucharest, he succeeded in
underlining America's commitment to free and fair elections without
unduly alienating government leaders who have been strongly
criticized by the opposition.
   Less than two weeks ago, the United States criticized the
National Salvation Front government, which took power after the
December revolution that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu, for attempting to impede opposition parties contesting
the May 20 general election.
   Baker did applaud ``the reform movement'' in Romania since
Ceausescu's overthrow and execution, but he didn't praise the
government.
   Premier Petre Roman said ``an endorsement would be very good,
but ... ''
   Baker said he told interim President Ion Iliescu and Roman that
``the betterment of relations of the United States with Romania
will depend on fully free, fair elections and the respect for human
rights and the rights of minorities.''
   Baker also announced that the United States will offer Romania
$80 million in food assistance. A State Department official said it
will include 550,000 tons of feed grain and 8,200 tons of butter.
   The Romanian government previously had complained that the
United States had not fulfilled a promise to send aid following the
revolution.
   Opposition leaders told Baker they were still being intimidated
by the government, said Corneliu Coposu, president of the National
Peasant Party, the country's largest opposition group.
   ``The collective atmosphere was that there is fear, and it is a
sustained action of fear,'' Coposu said.
   The Front's decision to participate in the election, reversing
an earlier pledge to stay out, sparked mass demonstrations by
students and opponents who demanded it resign.
   In a compromise, the Front agreed to share power in a new
Provisional Council of National Unity, which was inaugurated Friday
to run the country until the election.
   But many of the 17 opposition party leaders and student
representatives who met Baker said they told him the Front was
trying to control the ruling council and continue the old Communist
system under a new guise.
   ``In Romania the youth made its revolution, and Iliescu and his
friends have monopolized the revolution,'' said Nica Leon,
president of the Liberal Democratic Party.
   Toma George Maiorescu, president of the Romanian Ecological
Movement, said the parties also told Baker that elections should be
postponed at least until September.
   Iliescu called his meeting with Baker ``positive'' and said the
secretary of state had reaffirmed U.S. willingness to ``meet
halfway'' Romania's new openness.
   Roman said he viewed Baker's visit ``as the beginning of a new
relationship on a new basis, taking into account the new democracy.
... From now on, we can speak of American aid as not just
humanitarian, I mean aid to rebuild.''
   But Baker was noncommital on the question of economic aid or
restoring Romania's favored-nation trading status. Several
opposition parties told him the United States should wait until
after the election before it makes a decision.

<HEAD>Class Action Sought for Pipeline Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A lawsuit filed on behalf of a carpenter
seeking a pension for work on the Alaska pipeline eventually could
include up to 23,000 union members as plaintiffs, a lawyer said.
   The lawsuit was filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Portland
against the Northern Alaska Carpenters Retirement Fund by Daniel
Duncan, a carpenter from Medford who was disabled while working on
the pipeline.
   Duncan claims carpenters were wrongly deprived of retirement
money when the fund's trustee forfeited their contributions. Duncan
claims in the lawsuit that the trustee refused to vest carpenters
with less than 10 years service who were laid off as the oil
pipeline project neared completion in the late 1970s.
   The lawsuit seeks certification from the court to add as
plaintiffs as many as 3,000 other carpenters who worked on the
pipeline between Dec. 31, 1972, and Jan. 1, 1980.
   Richard J. Birmingham, one of Duncan's attorneys, said Friday
that the lawsuit also could apply to 20,000 other union members,
including Teamsters, and total retirement claims could run as high
as $50 million.
   William Earhart, whose Portland company administers the
carpenters' retirement fund, said Friday he had no comment on the
lawsuit.
   Duncan alleges in his lawsuit that the carpenters' union was
``partially terminated'' under federal law when the layoffs reached
significant portions of the membership.
   Under the law, the lawsuit says, non-vested union members
automatically become vested in their retirement fund when partial
termination occurs.
   The lawsuit says a rider attached to a budget bill in 1984 by
Alaska's two senators unconstitutionally denied union members the
protection of the doctrine of partial termination.
   The lawsuit asks that the Northern Alaska Carpenters Retirement
Fund be required to vest class members. It seeks to have the fund
enjoined from liquidating or distributing trust funds so as to
prevent payment of the accrued benefits.
   It also asks that class members be paid their accrued benefits
as damages and seeks attorneys' fees.

   Nelson Mandela's emergence Sunday from nearly
three decades in prison brought praise from world leaders, but the
international rejoicing was tempered by appeals for swifter
progress toward ending apartheid.
   As Mandela, 71, walked from the grounds of his prison outside
Cape Town into crowds of supporters who had campaigned ceaselessly
for his release, the African National Congress welcomed him ``to
the warm embrace of our people and the national liberation
movement.''
   President Bush said he telephoned Mandela, told him all
Americans ``were rejoicing at his release'' and invited him to the
White House.
   ``I stated to him our desire to see a peaceful evolution towards
a totally racially free South Africa, a society without prejudice,
a society of total freedom,'' Bush told reporters in the Rose
Garden.
   In Atlanta, Coretta Scott King, widow of slain U.S. civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr., said she was overjoyed by the
release of Mandela, ``who has shown us the tremendous power of
unearned suffering for a just cause.''
   Special church services were scheduled in many U.S. cities.
   India's Prime Minister V.P. Singh called Mandela a ``valiant
soldier of independence, justice and equality,'' and French Premier
Michel Rocard invited him to visit Paris.
   Gabon's chief of state urged other African nations to restore
diplomatic ties with South Africa, and Britain said it was time to
reconsider international sanctions.
   Anti-apartheid campaigners took to the streets to celebrate,
including thousands who thronged to London's Trafalgar Square,
singing, dancing and waving flags of the newly legalized ANC.
   Mandela's release provided a ``surge of hope'' that should be
harnessed to open talks between the government and the black
majority, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said. Hurd's
deputy, Foreign Minister William Waldegrave, called Mandela ``a
leader of real stature to represent the Africans who can enter into
dialogue.''
   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda called for the ANC to suspend
guerrilla actions in South Africa but to maintain its military
capability in case of violence by right-wing extremists.
   ``The time for talking has come,'' said Kaunda, whose country
plays host to the ANC's exile headquarters and guerrilla bases.
   But the ANC said in a statement released in Harare, Zimbabwe,
that it was not prepared to open talks with the white-minority
government of President F.W. de Klerk until he lifted the state of
emergency, released all political prisoners, and repealed laws that
formed the basis of the apartheid system of segregation.
   Mandela reiterated those conditions at a rally Sunday.
   The Nigerian government called Mandela's release ``positive
proof'' that international sanctions have worked, but Britain said
it would contact the European Community and the Commonwealth of
former colonies about encouraging new ties with South Africa.
   ``When people are doing the right thing boldly and courageously
as President de Klerk is it seems quite absurd to still use sticks
to beat them with, however small those sticks may be,'' British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said.
   ``The die is now cast. The way is open for peaceable
negotiations. What is the use of trying to hit out? Why not help
the process.''
   Canadian sanctions will remain in effect until apartheid is
scrapped, Foreign Minister Joe Clark said. Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney wrote a letter to Mandela, saying, ``We celebrate with the
world that your freedom from prison today may soon lead to the
freedom of all South Africans from the injustice of apartheid.''
   Sweden, which maintained strong economic sanctions against South
Africa, said Mandela's release creates new hope for democracy and
freedom.
   ``Through his courage, commitment and moral strength, he has
been a constant source of inspiration for those who hold the ideals
of freedom, democracy and fairness high,'' Swedish Premier Ingvar
Carlsson said on Mandela.
   In Poland, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa called Mandela a man
who devoted his life to the realization of the idea of equality of
all people.
   ``Experiences of recent months show that there is no room in the
world any more for regimes which hold human rights in contempt,''
Walesa said in Warsaw.
   Australia's Prime Minister Bob Hawke described Mandela's release
as the most positive sign the world had seen that ``the walls of
the abhorrent apartheid system may soon be breached.''
   Hawke and Spain's Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez
also urged the South African government to build on the good will
flowing from Mandela's release.
   President Mario Soares of Portugal said he was ``deeply
satisfied with this, the latest significant step in the democratic
reforms currently going on in South Africa.''
   In Italy, Premier Giulio Andreotti welcomed the ``gesture
capable of giving a fundamental impetus to dialogue between all
South Africans.''
   Israel welcomed the South African government's move as a step
toward improving relations between the two countries.
   Human rights activist Natan Sharansky, who emigrated to Israel
after spending nine years in Soviet prisons and labor camps, said
he was glad Mandela was released and hoped ``the years in prison
have changed this leader, that he is now more tolerant and is ready
for a dialogue.''
   Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said he hoped Mandela
would play a major role in national reconciliation in South Africa,
and Jordan's Minister of Information Ibrahim Izzeddine agreed:
   ``It's a great moment to see a national leader who has suffered
for 27 years go free and have the chance to lead his country to
freedom. ... It's a great moment in the history of mankind.''
   Thousands of well-wishers gathered for a street party outside
the South African Embassy overlooking London's Trafalgar Square,
where anti-apartheid protesters have stage a round-the-clock picket
since April 19, 1986, demanding Mandela's release.
   Busloads of police officers stood by, but the crowd was
good-natured, waving ANC flags, singing and dancing. A banner was
placed at the foot of Admiral Nelson's column in the center of the
square, temporarily renaming it ``Mandela's Column.''
   Elsewhere in Britain, church bells pealed when Mandela was
released, and a vigil was held at northern England's York Minster
cathedral.

   It took two takes, but President Bush did the
honors Sunday night introducing a White House television special
honoring literacy teachers and adults who learned to read late in
life.
   The East Room of the White House was transformed into a studio
for the taping of the National Literacy Honors Gala, which featured
walk-on appearances by such stars as Jamie Lee Curtis, Barbara
Mandrell, Anita Baker, Patrick Swayze and Kermit the Frog.
   Bush and his wife Barbara, a longtime crusader on behalf of
literacy causes, presented awards to three literacy teachers and
three adult learners.
   The president had to redo his two-minute opening at the end of
the show, which will be aired on ABC Television as a prime-time
special sometime in March.
   An embarrassed producer announced at the end of the hour-long
taping that because of a glitch, the cameras had not been rolling
during Bush's first try.
   ``A wireless mike antenna fell. It hit a lighting cable and it
grounded the whole thing out,'' a sound man explained afterwards.
   The award recipients were instructed to take their medallions
off ``because we're back at the top of the show.''
   Bush good-naturedly did his remarks all over again. After
finishing, he laughed and said, ``Show biz! Is that it?''
   Swayze, of ``Dirty Dancing'' fame, also repeated his remarks.
   ``Literacy is critical to our very future .... essential to our
freedom,'' Bush said.
   Many in the East Room audience of 200 were moved to tears by
taped footage of the three adults who spoke of their problems as
illiterates and how they overcame them. They were: James Underwood,
49, of Charlotte, N.C., who now runs a $300,000-a-year cleaning
business; Inez Cortiz, 30, of Nicholson, Pa., an ex-welfare mother
now training to be a nurse, and Ed Castor, 47, of Windfall, Ind.,
who learne to read after technology made his old factory job
obsolete.
   Also honored were three teachers, Lorna Anderson, 57, of Park
Forest, Ill., Arthur Strope, 65, of Stuart, Fla., and Evangeline
Olea, 43, of Phoenix. Publisher Harold McGraw Jr. and Wally
``Famous'' Amos, the cookie entrepreneur, were honored for
leadership in the literacy movement.
   Bush voiced the hope that the tales would inspire ``millions''
more people to seek help.
   Illiteracy is a problem that runs ``from the most personal and
private pain to the broadest national distress, from those who will
never know that a book can be a friend in the still hours of the
night, to those who do not even have the skills to get a job or be
an active citizen,'' he said.
   It figures in ``every human and social concern: labor lost,
potential unfulfilled, poverty, bigotry and despair.''
   ABC Television has not yet selected a date for the airing of the
special.

<HEAD>Says Soviet Jewish Influx Jeopardizes Peace Efforts; Condemns Bus
Attack</HEAD>

   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said Sunday the
growing controversy over Soviet-Jewish emigration to Israel will
jeopardize efforts for a peaceful settlement to the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
   Arafat appealed to the Soviet Union to rescind an agreement with
Israel for direct flights between Moscow and Tel-Aviv for
immigrants, and he urged Arab leaders to convene an emergency Arab
summit.
   Moscow already has suspended the flight agreement.
   Speaking at a news conference, Arafat also accused Israeli
soldiers of killing at least four Palestinians in the Gaza Strip
town from which a bus filled with Israeli tourists left before it
was attacked in the Egyptian desert last week.
   He rejected reports linking the Palestine Liberation
Organization or other Palestinian groups with last Sunday's attack
40 miles northeast of Cairo. Nine Israelis were killed in the
ambush.
   ``The attack must have been carried out by extremists whatever
their color, identity or nationality is,'' he said at a news
conference in Baghdad, where the PLO has offices and its official
radio station, Voice of Palestine.
   In a published interview, Arafat appeared to condemn the attack.
   ``Of course we were surprised by the attack, because we reject
aggression on any civilians, be they Jewish, American or
European,'' Monday's issue of the London-based magazine Arab
Jerusalem quoted him as saying.
   But Arafat said the longer the United States and Israel avoid a
comprehensive peace settlement, ``the larger the possibility of an
explosion in the region.''
   Cairo's relations with the PLO have been strained over the bus
attack, with columnists in government-run newspapers condemning
Arafat by name for not speaking out against it. News reports have
said those involved were Palestinian.
   At the news conference, Arafat said the recent influx of Soviet
Jews to Israel was made possible because of an understanding
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at
their December summit in Malta.
   ``It is regrettable to say that this part of the accord was made
in Malta after President Bush insisted that the Soviets open a
direct route to Israel,'' he said.
   Arafat said an Arab League delegation will visit Moscow later
this month to ask the Kremlin to halt the exodus permanently.
   Arafat declined to say if the Soviet Union promised to take any
steps last week during talks between a Soviet envoy and PLO leaders
in Tunis, but that the PLO has ongoing contacts with Moscow on the
issue.
   The leader of a radical PLO faction, Nayef Hawatmeh,
secretary-general of the Marxist-oriented Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, claimed Feb. 3 that Soviet Deputy Foreign
Minister Gennady Tarassov made such a promise in Tunis.
   Arafat said the Israeli army has launched massive raids against
the Palestinian residents of Rafah since Thursday, after reports
alleged that the bus attack was planned and executed by residents
of the Mediterranean town in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip.
   Arafat said at least four Palestinians were killed and 331
wounded in Rafah since the Israeli army began the alleged offensive.
   ``I appeal to the world community to halt this massacre
immediately,'' he said.
   There was no independent confirmation of his allegations, but
one Palestinian was shot dead in Rafah and 52 suffered gunshot
wounds in the city since the bus attack, Arab reports and hospital
officials say.
   Most of the casualties resulted from three days of protests
following Wednesday's fatal shooting of a Palestinian teen-ager
during a stone-throwing clash.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Sunday the bus attack was
planned by two Palestinian deportees. Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan
Shomron said in a speech in Tel Aviv the attack was carried out by
what he called the ``Palestinian wing of the Islamic Jihad group,''
Israel's national news agency Itim said. No further details were
given.
   Israeli soldiers or civilians have killed 655 Palestinians in
the 26-month-old uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
At least 181 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs as
suspected collaborators, while 43 Israelis have died.

<TEXT>
   Government television
broadcast Nelson Mandela's release from prison live Sunday and
later showed the speech in which he endorsed armed struggle against
the government.
   Customarily, the South African Broadcasting Corp. offers live
news coverage only of well-controlled events such as a presidential
seech. But the company scrapped the heart of its afternoon
programming Sunday to show Mandela's walk to freedom, even though
the event occurred 75 minutes behind schedule.
   In the interim, SABC reporter Clarence Keyter became caught up
in the excitement of the moment, repeatedly telling viewers they
were about to watch history in the making.
   ``This is the moment the world has been waiting for,'' Keyter
said. ``The sun is shining on South Africa.''
   The coverage stopped when Mandela's motorcade pulled away from
Victor Verster prison en route to Cape Town, and there was no live
coverage of later violence in the city or of Mandela's speech at
City Hall.
   But the main 8 p.m. news program devoted an entire hour to the
release, showing footage of black youths looting shops and
broadcasting on a delayed basis virtually all of Mandela's speech.
   Prior to Feb. 2, when President F.W. de Klerk lifted a 30-year
ban on the ANC, the speech would have been illegal and the SABC
could have been prosecuted for broadcasting it. But on Sunday, as
Keyter and Mandela both said, a new South Africa was in the making.

<HEAD>Bishop Becomes Chief of African Tribal Clan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moses B. Anderson is one of 13 black Roman
Catholic bishops in the United States, but the multicolored,
braided rope about his neck makes him unique. He's chief of an
African tribal clan.
   The Motor City's 61-year-old auxiliary bishop last month became
chief of the Aduana clan of West Africa's Ashanti tribe in Ghana.
With the title came the symbolic braid and a new name: Nana Kwasi
Amoateng I.
   ``I won't be able to live there but I intend to do as much as I
can for the village (of Antoa),'' Anderson said. ``I am in more of
a position now to get more African-Americans involved with Africa.''
   Last month, about 1,000 Ashanti gathered in Antoa for Anderson's
installation as the clan's first-ever chief. Before the tribe's
centuries-old ceremony, the bishop had to buy a ceremonial sword,
umbrella and sandals.
   ``Chiefs may never be seen barefoot and their feet can never
touch the ground, so they must always wear sandals,'' Anderson
said. ``They must always be seen clothed and they can never sit on
the ground. That's why stools or chairs are so important. It is a
symbol of dignity to sit. It is a symbol of dignity to be sheltered
by an umbrella.''
   Anderson's new role is based on Ashanti culture, not the tribal
religion, so there is no conflict with his Catholic duties.
Anderson said Cardinal Edmund Szoka, who heads the Detroit
Archdiocese until he moves to a Vatican post in June, is supportive
of his new role.
   ``He said, `Well, now remember that you're still a Catholic
bishop.' He was just joking. He's really interested in knowing what
all this means for black Catholics in Detroit and around the
country,'' Anderson said.
   The cleric said he already has started work on helping the
500-member village. Anderson said he plans to collect items such as
ballpoint pens, chalk, paper and clothing.
   He said he also hopes to raise money to help buy a computer for
Bishop Peter Sarpong of the Kumasi Diocese, who in 1987 suggested
Anderson become a chief.
   ``They invited me in 1988 for the ceremony, but that was at the
same time of the church closings and I wanted to stay here to be
supportive of the cardinal,'' Anderson said, referring to Szoka's
consolidation plan which closed 35 churches in the archdiocese.
   Anderson said he now tells people he is a Ghanian-American,
rather than African-American.

<TEXT>
   Seven score and one year ago, the A.
Lincoln who visited this seashore town may have been just a grocer
from Philadelphia.
   But some residents continue to insist it was the future 16th
president who stayed in a hotel in this resort community on July
31, 1849.
   Those who dispute the tale say Lincoln, whose birthday comes
Monday, was in Springfield, Ill., practicing law that long-ago July
31, winning a judgment of $112.30 for a client. Casting further
doubt is a record of an Abel Lincoln, a Philadelphia grocer who
they say may have headed to the Jersey shore that summer day.
   ``All these years, we may have been honoring a grocer,'' said
Jake Schaad, who has researched the story and is writing a book
about the history of Cape May.
   One version of the story claims that, while in Cape May, Lincoln
rejected an offer to become governor of the Oregon Territory after
his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, told him she was afraid of Indians,
Schaad said.
   ``It's a good story but it didn't happen,'' Schaad said, adding
that other versions have Lincoln fathering an illegitimate son
while at the shore.
   The town claims to be America's oldest seashore resort, tracing
its visitors to just after the Revolutionary War, said Jeffrey
Dorwart, a history professor at Rutgers University-Camden who is
researching a book for Cape May County's 300th anniversary in 1992.
   Some long-time residents knew Henry Irick, who said that when he
was 16 he came with his father and Lincoln to this community of
Victorian homes and lazy sea breezes.
   Mary Ann Nyblade, a 65-year-old Cape May resident who can trace
her family in the town back to 1695, said she still clings to
Irick's story.
   Irick was the son of John S. Irick, a wealthy Vincentown farmer
who supposedly met up with Lincoln and came to the Mansion House in
Cape May. He recalled that visit in a newspaper interview in the
late 1890s and the story was born, Ms. Nyblade said.
   The Mansion House guest register shows an A. Lincoln and wife
from Philadelphia in Room 24. Fire destroyed the hotel in 1856 but
the register was saved, Ms. Nyblade said. She acknowledged that the
reference to Philadelphia on the register was a problem for the
future-president theorists, but say the future president may have
listed Philadelphia if they had taken the steamboat from there to
Cape May.
   The man who saved that register was Lewis Stevens, and the
250-page book is now in Huntsville, Ala., in a safe-deposit box
owned by Bill Stevens, Ms. Nyblade's nephew and a descendant of
Lewis Stevens.
   Bill Stevens said in a telephone interview that the register
contains signatures of other famous people such as Sen. Henry Clay.
However, he said he has learned too much about Lincoln to believe
he could have visited Cape May.
   ``I'm convinced he was not in Cape May at that time,'' he said.
   There's no doubt about that, said Thomas F. Schwartz, curator of
the Lincoln collection at the Illinois State Historical Library in
Springfield.
   On July 31, Lincoln was at least 1,000 miles west of Cape May,
filing an affidavit in Sangamon County Circuit Court for Henry
Bailer, who was owed $111.75 by Oliver Davis. Davis ended up paying
$112.30, which Schwartz guesses included interest.
   Dorwart said he can prove President Benjamin Harrison spent
summers in Cape May, as did President U.S. Grant and Woodrow Wilson
while he was governor of New Jersey. But Lincoln is a different
story.
   ``My sense is that, since looking at the Lincoln papers, he was
in Illinois,'' Dorwart said.
   He said residents of Cape May, 50 miles south of the Mason-Dixon
Line and site of several duels between Northerners and Southerners
in the 1840s and 1850s, may have been trying to prove their loyalty
to the Union after the Civil War by circulating the story.
   Irick's tale probably cemented the story as fact, Dorwart said.
   The Cape May County Historical Museum still features a facsimile
of the hotel register signature and everybody acknowledges that
some legends just seem to die hard.
   ``Even if Lincoln didn't come down here, it's part of our
culture that he was here,'' Dorwart said.

<HEAD>Bradley Raises More than $4 Million toward 1990 Senate Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With more than $4.1 million in the bank for
his 1990 Senate race, New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley again has
demonstrated his prodigious power to draw money from a national
pool although he deflects speculation about his presidential
aspirations.
   Contributions of nearly $4.5 million flowed into the Bradley
account in 1989, including $3.9 million from individuals, $570,475
from political action committees and $17,500 from the Democratic
Party, Federal Election Commission records show.
   Dividends and interest on the money brought in nearly $200,000,
according to the Democrat's 1989 campaign finance report.
   Bradley has picked up $9.45 million in contributions, interest
and refunds since Jan. 1, 1985, including $8.9 million in
contributions alone. Among senators facing the voters this year, he
is second only to Sen. Phil Gramm, D-Texas, with $10.5 million in
receipts, according to an analysis by Common Cause.
   Campaign manager Nick Donatiello says he expects to raise an
additional $2 million, at least, to help buy expensive television
advertising time in the New York and Philadelphia markets.
   Although the Bradley campaign organization is not yet working
against any announced opponent _ New Jersey Republicans say they
hope to announce a candidate by March _ it spent $2.79 million last
year on operations, $1.8 million in the last six months, reports
indicate.
   The senator maintains he is running for only one job: ``What I
want to do is be a U.S. senator from New Jersey,'' he repeated last
week.
   Bradley may not yet know whether 1992 will be his year to reach
for the Democratic presidential nomination, but his statewide
re-election effort has national overtones.
   _ Bradley paid more than $200,000 to Joe Peritz and Associates
of Wilton, Conn., for polling. Although Donatiello insists the
``vast majority'' of those surveyed are from New Jersey, the
senator said his campaign had been taking the national pulse on
such issues as tax reform. That issue is close to Bradley's heart
because he helped design 1986 tax reform legislation.
   _ His 1990 campaign has purchased about $500,000 in computer
equipment to keep track of his 30,000 to 35,000 contributors around
the country, including 7,000 new donors, according to Donatiello.
   _ In addition, the campaign has paid thousands of dollars for
video screens to project Bradley's larger-than-life image across
banquet halls at his fund-raisers. Expenditures from July to
December also included $35,000 paid to a California media
consultant, Michael Kaye and Associates, who has worked for
Democratic Sens. Edward Kennedy and Alan Cranston.
   Kaye, who has worked with Bradley throughout his career,
designed 30-second television spots that ran last summer on New
Jersey's cable stations and were reintroduced last Monday. The
latest cable spots carry no campaign message but feature Bradley
chatting about such issues as clean drinking water and deterring
youngsters from joining gangs.
   While he concentrates his public comments about the race on
issues that affect New Jersey constituents, the senator's active
fund-raising schedule has included a Boston event Sept. 25 that
raised $100,000; a Los Angeles event Oct. 12 that raised $650,000;
a Chicago event Nov. 6 that brought in $200,000; and a
$1,000-a-person New Jersey fund-raiser Dec. 4 that brought in
$500,000.
   The senator has been especially successful in California, where
help from Michael Eisner, chief executive officer of Disney
Studios, and Michael Ovitz, head of Creative Artists Agency, has
brought dollars and attention from Hollywood's heavy hitters.
   Bradley's latest group of celebrity contributors include
novelists Judith Krantz and Sidney Sheldon, ``Platoon'' and ``Wall
Street'' screenwriter and producer Oliver Stone, sister gossip
columnists Abigail Van Buren, known for her Dear Abby column and
Eppie Lederer, known popularly as Ann Landers, and ``Tootsie'' and
``Out of Africa'' director and producer Sydney Pollack.
   Television gossip columnist Rona Barrett, former Eagles rock
musician Don Henley, singer Neil Diamond, actress Sally Field and
Motown Records founder Berry Gordy also fill the pages of Bradley's
contributor list.

   Heavy rain drenched southern Florida on Sunday, and light
showers and snow fell in the Northwest, the Ohio Valley.
   Rain also fell in the lower Great Lakes region. Light snow fell
on the upper Mississippi Valley, the upper Great Lakes and Maine.
   In the Northwest, a cold front prompted a snow advisory for
parts of Montana and Washington. Up to a half-foot of snow was
possible in mountain passes, the National Weather Service said.
   Temperatures were expected to plunge in Washington and other
northwestern states.
   Cold arctic air brought rain to Washington and Oregon. Astoria,
Ore., received a half-inch of rain in six hours ending at 1 p.m.
EST.
   Sunny skies prevailed from the southern and central High Plains
to Georgia and the Carolinas after severe thunderstorms battered
parts of the Southeast with tornadoes and high winds Saturday,
killing four people and injuring dozens.
   Skies were also sunny across much of New England.
   The cold spot in the Lower 48 states was International Falls,
Minn., where the morning low was minus 7 degrees.
   Mountain highways were reopened and the threat of flooding eased
on southwest Washington rivers.

   President Bush telephoned Nelson Mandela from
the White House on Sunday, told him all Americans ``were rejoicing
at his release'' after 27 years in South Africa's prisons and
personally invited him to the White House.
   ``I stated to him our desire to see a peaceful evolution towards
a totally racially free South Africa, a society without prejudice,
a society of total freedom,'' Bush told reporters in the Rose
Garden late Sunday afternoon.
   ``He told me that he wanted to consult some of his colleagues,
but that he expected he would be able to accept my invitation,''
the president said.
   ``I told him that all Americans were delighted after these many
years in jail that he was released, that we were rejoicing at his
release,'' said Bush.
   ``It was a very friendly conversation. It lasted five or six
minutes, maybe, and he expressed his gratitude to me and to the
American people for calling,'' said Bush.
   The president said the future of U.S. sanctions against the
white minority government of South Africa was not discussed during
his brief conversation with the African National Congress leader.
   ``That did not come up. I will address that at an appropriate
time. There's no time frame. I will be discussing that with our top
advisers,'' said Bush, who on Saturday called South African
President F.W. de Klerk and invited him to pay a separate visit to
Washington.
   ``I'm not prepared to express my view on sanctions at this time.
We've had some momentous events, and I think the thing is to let
these events settle in now,'' said Bush. ``There's differences of
opinion in the Congress ... (and) American public opinion. Let's
just rejoice in the fact that Mr. de Klerk took some very forward
steps and let us rejoice in the fact that Mr. Mandela is free.''
   Asked whether he planned to send Secretary of State James A.
Baker III to South Africa now, Bush said, ``I have no immediate
plans to do that,'' but said he would not rule it out.
   Bush, asked whether he plans a more active U.S. role in seeking
a peaceful solution to the problems in South Africa, said:
``Anytime that human rights and equality are at stake anywhere in
the world, the United States has a very useful role to play, and I
think both President de Klerk and Mr. Mandela feel that way.
Indeed, both of them indicated that to me.
   ``We have had a cutoff of high level visits for some time, but
now with the freeing of Mandela it is appropriate that high-level
visits take place,'' said Bush, who added that he is ``sure they'll
be separate'' visits.
   He said Mandela ``sounded restrained'' in their telephone
conversation. ``His comments were very warm and very _ I don't want
to use the word appreciative _ but I think he was glad that I
called. There was a calmness in his voice. And he, all in all, I'm
sure, enjoyed this first day very, very much. Although he didn't
state that ... you could just sense it from the way in which he
expressed himself.''
   Bush said he expects a de Klerk visit to draw criticism.
   ``I've invited Mr. de Klerk to the White House. I think the
world rejoices in the fact that Mr. Mandela is free. And there's
always going to be somebody shooting at Mr. de Klerk's decision or
something of that nature, or maybe mine. But I've invited him here.
I hope he comes here. I have invited Mr. Mandela here. I hope he
comes here. ... That's the way it is. That's the way it is going to
be.
   ``There's always somebody out on the fringe somewhere trying to
assign an unhelpful motive. I think Mr. de Klerk in making certain
changes inside South Africa, has done something that many of us
felt was long overdue, but nevertheless he's done it. ... He
deserves credit for that,'' said Bush.
   The U.S. sanctions include a ban on new investment in South
Africa, a prohibition on the import of certain South African
products and the cancellation of landing rights for South African
airlines.
   Asked whether he felt the sanctions had prompted de Klerk's
decision, Bush said, ``Maybe so. I don't know.''
   Even as Mandela walked to freedom Sunday, the debate was already
joined in the United States over whether to lift the sanctions.
   ``It was wonderful to see that man walk out of that prison,''
said Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Africa. ``The struggle of apartheid is not
a struggle of black against white. It is a struggle of democracy.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., speaking on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,''
said, ``It's time for us to begin discussing in our country,
between the president and the Congress, as to when the sanctions
would end and which ones would end. We certainly need to
acknowledge these events. We certainly need to encourage the South
African government to go forward.''
   But Rep. William H. Gray, D-Pa., the House majority whip, said,
``Although we welcome (the freeing of Mandela) and we applaud the
move by Mr. de Klerk, the fact is that South Africa is still not
free. The future is really in their hands. ... Whether or not
sanctions are lifted really is up to the de Klerk government.''
   Herman Cohen, the assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation, that ``if you get an
equitable situation based on negotiations where everybody gives a
little and everyone ends up as a winner, I think you can have a lot
better South Africa.''
   South Africa's minority white population of 5 million has
maintained control through its apartheid laws and denial of
political rights to the 26 million black residents.
   Cohen said, ``The last thing the American government should be
doing is prescribing the type of constitutional change that we want
to see.''
   Asked whether the United States backs the principal of one man,
one vote, the State Department official replied, ``We believe in
universal suffrage. And if you have one man, one vote, in every
democratic system in the world, there are limitations on pure
majority rule.''
   He called Bush's invitation to de Klerk ``a tremendous symbolic
gesture.''
   Bush ``would be the first person to say that apartheid is not
over. It's just the beginning of a process right now, and we
certainly wouldn't want to eliminate all of our leverage in that
situation,'' Cohen said.
   ``But I think the time has now come to make a gesture which, in
effect, says, `You're making progress,''' said Cohen.
   Gray said the Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 _ passed over the veto
of then-President Reagan _ spelled out that before sanctions could
be lifted, South Africa had to free Mandela and all other political
prisoners and meet at least three of four other criteria. De Klerk
has already met one of the conditions by legalizing the African
National Congress and other anti-apartheid groups.
   The other conditions include an agreement by the government to
engage in good faith negotiations on South Africa's political
future, the lifting of the state of emergency, and making
substantial progress toward dismantling apartheid.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the Senate majority whip, said,
``Mandela is free, but black Africa still groans under the yoke of
apartheid. The United States should keep up the pressure of
sanctions, which undoubtedly have worked well, until the last
vestige of apartheid is eradicated.''
   The White House said Feb. 1 that Mandela would be invited to
come at his convenience upon his release from prison after 27 years.
   Bush had already signalled more than a week ago that he would
invite both Mandela and de Klerk to the White House for separate
visits. John Herrick, a spokesman, said that in Saturday's phone
call Bush ``expressed his admiration for the significant
initiatives announced by the South African government in recent
days and reiterated his hope there would be continued progress
toward a negotiated solution in an atmosphere of nonviolence.''

   More than 2,000 people protested
outside the government's television building Sunday, demanding the
ouster of journalists they said were loyalists of toppled Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   A dozen tanks and armored personnel carriers held back the
demonstrators outside the building, where during the December
revolution the new government's leaders took refuge while the army
fought off Ceausescu's secret police.
   It was one of several protests, some involving tens of thousands
of people, held by various groups over the weekend that are
demanding an end to what they consider unfair policies that remain
from the days of the executed hard-liner.
   Also Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker visited for
several hours with government and opposition leaders. He withheld
praise for the government and listened to opposition complaints.
   The demonstrators outside the TV headquarters accused the ruling
National Salvation Front of controlling the mass media with
Ceausescu loyalists. They chanted ``Down with Communism!'' and ``We
protected you, you've deceived us!'' a reference to the fierce
battles for control of the media during the revolution.
   The Front ruled the country for six weeks after the uprising and
now dominates the multiparty Council of National Union, which was
inaugurated Friday and will rule until elections in May.
   Dumitru Iuga, chief of the Free Broadcasters Union, told the
demonstrators that after two hours of talks he had reached an
agreement with the TV authorities ``that would eradicate the last
remnants of Ceausescu's tragedy and preserve what we won in
December.''
   He did not provide details of the agreement, which he promised
would be published Tuesday in a newspaper.
   The protesters' primary demand was the removal of TV
director-general Petre Constantin and news anchormen Gheorghe
Marinescu and Petre Popescu.
   ``They are absolutely associated with the previous regime,
therefore they are tainted and must go,'' said Valentin Balmas, a
TV technician.
   Balmas said the demonstrators were not satisfied with the
resignation Friday of broadcasting chief Aurel Dragos Munteanu,
since ``censorship is not done by one man alone.''
   Across town, several hundred medical students protested the
refusal of the Bucharest Medical School to increase next year's
class to accommodate students who have been displaced by about 400
foreign students.
   ``The authorities of the Bucharest Medical School, which are
loyalists of the former regime, say we should admit a maximum of
foreigners because we need their hard currency,'' said Gheorghe
Mihai, a parent of one of the students.
   On Saturday, members of the 100,000-strong Romanian Drivers'
Syndicate surrounded the Front's headquarters in Victory Square
with several hundred trucks and buses, demanding better work
conditions.
   About 100 army soldiers marched through Bucharest Saturday night
to demand their monthly salary be increased from the current 3,000
lei, about $150, to 5,000 lei, which is about double the monthly
average. They also demanded their mandatory length of service be
cut in half to one year.
   More than 40,000 ethnic Hungarians carrying candles and books
demonstrated peacefully in Tirgu Mures in central Romania on
Saturday, demanding equal rights, the official Rompres news agency
reported Sunday.
   Under Ceausescu, Romania's 2 million ethnic Hungarians
frequently complained that they were subjected to forced
assimilation policies, and the revolution was sparked by a protest
supporting an ethnic Hungarian clergyman.

   Nelson Mandela walked through a
prison gate to freedom Sunday, setting set off joyous celebrations
and violent clashes as blacks nationwide welcomed their leader back
from 27 years in jail.
   ``Comrades and fellow South Africans, I greet you all in the
name of peace, democracy and freedom for all,'' Mandela told tens
of thousands of cheering supporters who thronged outside City Hall
at twilight, many getting their first look at the 71-year-old
African National Congress leader.
   But he emphatically reaffirmed his commitment to the ANC's
guerrilla campaign and called for increased pressure to end
white-minority domination _ the same cause that resulted in his
life sentence on charges of plotting against the government. He
also reiterated that talks with the government cannot begin until
it lifts the state of emergency.
   ``I stand here before you not as a prophet, but as a humble
servant of you the people,'' said the white-haired Mandela, who
looked much more an elder statesman in his suit and tie than a
guerrilla leader.
   ``Today, the majority of South Africans, black and white,
recognize that apartheid has no future. It has to be ended by our
decisive mass action,'' he said in a rousing half-hour speech
frequently interrupted by roars of ``Viva!''
   ``We have waited too long for our freedom.''
   Violence broke out about the same time Mandela's motorcade
arrived in Cape Town from Victor Verster prison and delayed his
speech. Police said a black looter was shot to death by officers,
and first aid workers said more than 100 people were injured when
riot police fired shotguns after groups of black youths smashed
shop windows in the city center.
   Some youths retaliated by hurling bottles at the officers.
Hundreds of terrified people waiting to hear Mandela ran for cover
as police fired blasts of shotgun pellets.
   Clashes between police and celebrating blacks were reported in
at least two other areas, including the tribal homeland of Ciskei,
where hospital officials said police shot three people to death and
wounded 20.
   In Natal Province, where ANC supporters have been feuding with a
more conservative black group, police said 12 blacks were killed in
factional fighting Sunday. It was a harsh reminder of the bitter
feuds involving black factions who disagree on the best way to
fight for equality.
   Elsewhere, hundreds of thousands of blacks danced and jogged
through the streets of big cities and impoverished townships,
rejoicing at Mandela's freedom.
   ``Very good news, very good news,'' President Bush said after
Mandela's release. Bush said he telephoned Mandela, told him all
Americans ``were rejoicing at his release'' and invited him to the
White House.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, speaking at a church service outside
Cape Town shortly before Mandela was released, commended the South
African government for making a ``courageous step'' but said ``the
pillars of apartheid remain in place.''
   A thunderous cheer went up as the man who was the world's most
famous prisoner walked hand-in-hand with his wife, Winnie, through
the gate of Victor Verster prison in Paarl, 35 miles from Cape Town.
   Under a brilliant blue sky, the Mandelas gave clenched-fist
salutes to the hundreds of supporters who had waited for hours
outside, many of them waving green, gold and black ANC flags and
wearing T-shirts emblazoned with a youthful image of Mandela.
   Mandela appeared solemn and dignified as he and Winnie walked to
a white BMW sedan and climbed in. He broke into a broad smile as
the car set off slowly in a police-escorted motorcade.
   The decision to free Mandela, after a prolonged international
campaign on his behalf, was announced Saturday by President F.W. de
Klerk. Eight days earlier, de Klerk stunned the nation by lifting a
30-year ban on the ANC and announcing other reforms aimed at
clearing the way for black-white negotiations.
   De Klerk, who spoke at length Saturday on Mandela's release,
stayed out of the public eye Sunday. Anton Pretorius, a de Klerk
spokesman, said the president planned to comment on Mandela's
release later in the week.
   Government television, however, broadcast live Mandela's exit
from prison and later showed most of the ANC leader's speech.
   His elderly appearance probably shocked many South Africans, the
majority of whom were born after Mandela was last seen publicly in
1964.
   Mandela has clearly lost weight since the 1960s; both his face
and his body are leaner than when he was a sturdily built boxer
decades ago. His face is creased with two thick lines that frame
his strong, confident smile.
   Mandela in his speech called de Klerk ``a man of integrity'' who
had gone further than any previous National Party leader in
accommodating black political aspirations.
   But he said further steps _ including the lifting of the state
of emergency and release of all political prisoners _ must be taken
before talks can begin. The ANC shares these demands.
   Mandela was the last well-known political prisoner in South
Africa. Six of his ANC colleagues who had been imprisoned for more
than 25 years, including Walter Sisulu, were released in Octobr.
   In the mid-1980s, Mandela rejected offers to go free in exchange
for a renunciation of violence. De Klerk abandoned this condition,
although he said after meeting Mandela on Friday night that he
believed the black leader was ``committed to peaceful solutions.''
   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, one of the South African
government's harshest critics, urged the ANC to suspend guerrilla
actions in the wake of Mandela's release.
   But Mandela told the Cape Town crowd the ANC resorted to
violence in 1961 as a ``defensive action against the violence of
apartheid,'' and added, ``The factors which necessitated the armed
struggle still exist today.''
   ``We have no options but to continue,'' he said.
   He urged whites to ``join us in the safety of a new South
Africa. The freedom movement is a political home for you, too.''
   Mandela, whose imprisonment included years of hard labor on
windswept Robben Island in Cape Town's harbor, told his family:
``Your pain and suffering was far greater than my own.''

<HEAD>Return to Normal Winter Weather Helps Drive Gas Prices Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices are falling as temperatures
around the nation are rising, returning the market to its normal
winter patterns, industry analyst Trilby Lundberg said Sunday.
   Gasoline prices normally drop in the winter and rise in the
summer along with national driving patterns, Lundberg said Sunday.
However, they stayed higher than normal in January because
unusually cold weather increased the demand for heating oil and
crimped gasoline and diesel supplies at refineries, she said.
   When a warming trend moved across the nation in January, gas
prices fell again, she said. The result was a six-tenths-of-a-cent
decrease for all grades of fuel at gas pumps across the nation
between Jan. 19 and Feb. 9, Lundberg said.
   The average price of all grades of gasoline at the nation's
stations was 112.46 cents per gallon on Feb. 9, according to the
national Lundberg Survey of stations across the country.
   Lundberg added it was too early to tell if last week's spill of
an estimated 400,000 gallons of crude oil from a tanker off
Huntington Beach would have any effect on future gasoline prices.
   ``If any suppliers or marketers or dealers have been adversely
affected, we haven't heard of it,'' she said.
   The average prices of gasoline at self-service stations were:
100.95 cents per gallon for regular unleaded, 118.38 per gallon for
premium unleaded and 99.27 for regular leaded.
   The prices for full-service stations were: 129.09 cents per
gallon for regular unleaded, 142.51 for premium unleaded and 127.34
for regular leaded.
   Prices include all taxes.

<HEAD>`Some Americans Abroad' by Richard Nelson Opens at Lincoln Center</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The characters in Richard Nelson's ``Some
Americans Abroad'' are insufferable, their actions at best trivial
and at worst immoral.
   But Nelson is not portraying escaped convicts, white-collar
criminals or even discredited politicians. The object of his satire
is a group of Anglophile American academics and their students on a
yearly marathon tour of British theater.
   It's a specialized group to skewer, and if the scope of the
play, which which arrived Sunday at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater in
Lincoln Center, is narrow, its aim is deadly _ and delicious.
   These academics from a small, unidentified American college have
come to worship at the shrines of British drama _ particularly the
National Theater in London and that holiest of holys _ the Royal
Shakespeare Company's complex in Stratford-on-Avon.
   Two events turn the tour into turmoil. Both problems must be
solved by the chairman of the school's English department, Joe
Taylor, played with a wonderful all-enveloping smugness by Colin
Stinton. Taylor is the kind of teacher who demands truth in
literature if not in real life.
   The chairman must tell a colleague, who paid his own way over to
cement his position at the school, that his contract will not be
renewed. And Taylor must handle an accusation by an unstable
student that she was molested by a teacher.
   Nelson has great fun with these people as they race from play to
play to play. For them, it's quantity rather than quality that
counts. These intrepid theatergoers seem more concerned with seat
location, the food at intermission and how to divide the bill after
dinner than with what they are watching on stage.
   Much of the evening's enjoyment comes from director Roger
Michell's snappy production, cleverly designed by Alexandra Byrne.
The furniture and props for the play's 11 scenes hang precariously
above the stage. They are pulled down when needed while a jazz
combo performs and then carted offstage when a scene ends.
   Most of the other performers are up to Stinton's high standards.
Particularly effective are Bob Balaban as the nerdy assistant
professor on shaky status, John Bedford Lloyd as the pompous
professor accused of attacking a student and Frances Conroy as
another teacher trying to conceal an affair.
   Nelson's best scene occurs late in the play _ at a Pizza Hut in
Stratford, no less _ where the chairman and two of his professors
look at and then deny the mess they have created. It's hypocrisy at
its highest and wonderfully acted by Stinton, Bedford Lloyd and
Conroy.
   Some 30 years ago, Noel Coward wrote a wicked song called ``Why
Do the Wrong People Travel?'' for his musical ``Sail Away.'' In it,
he poked fun at the ubiquitous American tourist who would have been
better off _ and happier _ if he had stayed home. Much the same can
be said for Nelson's motley collection of pretentious academics.

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake hit the Pacific coast of
northeastern Japan early Monday morning, but there were no
immediate reports of casualties or damage, police and the nation's
meteorological agency said.
   There also were no tsunami _ huge waves that are triggered by
undersea disturbances such as earthquakes or volcanic activity, the
Central Meteorological Agency said.
   The agency said the earthquake had a preliminary reading of 5.5
on the Richter scale, a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake. Each increase of one number means the ground motion is
10 times greater.
   A quake of the magnitude of 5 is considered ``very strong,'' and
one of 6 is capable of widespread damage if it occurs in a
populated area.
   The temblor struck at 2:46 a.m. and was centered 24 miles under
the seabed off the coast of Ibaraki prefecture, the meteorological
agency said.

<HEAD>Communist Party Faction Calls For Voice In Coming Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of progressive Communists on Sunday
demanded a leading role in organizing this summer's party congress
and threatened otherwise to hold an alternative congress.
   The group, calling itself the Communist Party Democratic
Platform, adopted a statement that said the Communist Party Central
Committee plenum last week did not go far enough in moving toward
democratic reform.
   While the plenum agreed to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
proposal to permit multiparty elections, the group said it failed
to democratize the election procedure of delegates to the party
congress, set for late June or early July.
   ``The proposals formulated during the plenum have an
inconsistent and contradictory character, which is totally
inadequate to meet the demands of the existing situation,'' said
the statement, obtained by The Associated Press.
   ``The elections (of delegates) should be direct, according to
platforms, by secret ballot and with free nomination and
self-nomination of candidates,'' the Democratic Platform said.
   The group, which includes well-known progressives such as
Central Committee maverick Boris Yeltsin, economist Gavriil Popov
and historian Yuri Afanasyev.
   Yeltsin cast the lone vote against the plenum's reform, saying
it did not go far enough.
   The group called on Gorbachev and other members of the party's
ruling Politburo to meet with the progressives to discuss their
proposals for election of delegates.
   If their proposal is turned down or ignored by the party
leadership, the Democratic Platform said it would begin planning
for ``an alternative and genuinely democratic party congress.''
   That would raise the possibility of the creation of an
opposition faction inside the party, something the Communist
leadership has implacably resisted since the days of Vladimir Lenin.
   Last week's plenum also condemned the vote by Lithuania's
Communists to form a party independent of Moscow's control.

<HEAD>Security Council Opens Talks on Cambodia Peace Efforts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The five permanent members of the Security
Council Sunday discussed ways to broaden the U.N. role in Cambodia
peace efforts at a second round of talks on the issue.
   Representatives of the United States, Soviet Union, China,
Britain and France sat down for a working dinner to resume the
talks, which began last month in Paris.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said the
substantive work was planned for Monday.
   The representatives of the countries scheduled a morning meeting
with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and then
planned to convene for a full day of discussions on Cambodia peace
efforts.
   Proposals include a plan for the United Nations to administer
the Southeast Asian country and supervise elections there.
   Diplomats familiar with the talks said the meeting is just one
step in what they expect will be a lengthy process to devise an
international formula aimed at bringing peace to Cambodia.
   The full 15-member Security Council would have to approve
measures that would change the U.N.'s role.
   Participating in the talks are Xu Dunxin of China, Yuri
Miakotnykh of the Soviet Union, David Gillmore of Britain, Claude
Martin of France and Richard Soloman of the United States.
   After the Paris meeting, their countries issued a summary of
agreed principles that said ``an effective U.N. presence'' will be
required during an unspecified transition period before elections.
   The document said lasting peace in Cambodia can only be achieved
through a political settlement that includes the verified
withdrawal of foreign forces, a cease-fire and an end to outside
military assistance.
   The Vietnamese-backed government of Cambodian Premier Hun Sen
and the three guerrilla factions allied in an uneasy coalition all
have given at least guarded support for a major U.N. role.
   The statement by the five countries in Paris made no direct
mention of the Cambodian government, nor of Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, leader of a three-party guerrilla coalition.

   Thousands of Washington teachers plan to play
hooky Tuesday and participate in marches and rallies across the
state to protest a decision not to raise their salaries with a
projected budget surplus.
   As many as 35 of the state's 296 school districts may shut down
for the day because of the walkout expected by about 13,000
teachers and other education workers, affecting 200,000 students,
said Washington Education Association President Carla Nuxoll.
   About 8,000 more members of the union also are to participate in
rallies and marches over Gov. Booth Gardner's decision to ignore
the organization's request for immediate 10 percent pay increases.
   ``We are going to the constituents and telling them that if they
don't have adequately paid educational employees we aren't going to
be able to deliver an educational program,'' said association
spokeswoman Teresa Moore.
   The 49,000-member WEA represents more than 90 percent of the
teaching force in the state, including 42,000 of the state's 45,000
classroom teachers and about 7,000 other staff members.
   Teachers in the Seattle school district _ the state's largest
with about 43,000 students, 2,500 teachers and 1,500 other
employees _ are among those expected to participate in the protest,
said Nuxoll, and the district is scheduled to be closed.
   City schools Superintendent William Kendrick said in a statement
that he understands the teachers' frustration and strongly supports
increased funding for employee salaries.
   The idea for a walkout began with teachers in Everett and
Edmonds after the Legislature and Gardner failed last year to make
amends for salaries that slipped ever lower in the last 10 years,
Moore said.
   When Gardner did not earmark any of a projected $611 million,
1989-91 state surplus for teacher pay raises, support for the
walkout grew, Nuxoll said. The WEA wants $300 million of the
surplus to pay for salary increases for teachers and other
education workers.
   Gardner, Washington House Speaker Joe King and Senate Majority
Leader Jeannette Hayner say they sympathize with teachers but the
state doesn't have the money to meet their demands.
   The education association left it up to its chapters statewide
to decide whether to participate in the protest.
   ``In the 1980s, Olympia always told us the money was short, but
that we'd be first on the list when money was available. Now we
aren't even on the list,'' said Greg Waddle, northwest regional
chairman of the WEA.
   In some districts, school officials have expressed support for
the protest. The WEA contends teacher pay in Washington state has
slid from fourth in the nation a decade ago to 21st.
   Nuxoll said the average annual teacher salary in the state last
year was $29,176 for a person with 12 years of experience, a
bachelor's degree and 90 credits of postgraduate study, about $500
below the national average.
   Teachers received a 4 percent raise for the 1989-90 school year
that was approved by the Legislature last year, and are slated to
receive a 6 percent pay increase next school year.
   The $18,000 starting salary this year is not attracting new
entrants to the profession, Nuxoll said.
   ``We're saying that what's at risk in this state is the ability
to attract and retain the best teachers,'' she said.
   In Olympia, teachers plan a rally in the state Capitol Tuesday
night as part of the protest. Rallies are also planned in Spokane,
Yakima and Wenatchee.

   Any federal court order to end sit-ins at
Selma High School and City Hall would escalate racial tension
stemming from the dismissal of a black school superintendent, an
attorney for the protesters said Sunday.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Butler in Mobile scheduled a
telephone conference for Monday on a request from city attorneys
for a temporary restraining order halting the protests, which have
kept all Selma schools closed since Wednesday.
   ``It probably would escalate it,'' a lawyer for the protesters,
J.L. Chestnut, said of a court order. ``I don't think black people
give a damn about an injunction.''
   Butler said Chestnut will be included in the telephone
conference.
   Chestnut joined about 400 other blacks outside City Hall on
Sunday for a march to the high school for the second straight day.
Marchers made their way through a black neighborhood chanting, ``No
contract, no school,'' and ``Ain't going to let no injunction turn
me around.''
   The high school and City Hall were occupied for the fourth day
in a row. About 20 adults and 150 students were in the high school,
Mayor Joe Smitherman said.
   The racial turmoil began when six white members of the city
school board voted Feb. 2 to dismiss Norward Roussell, the city's
first black superintendent. The vote sparked protests leading to
the closing of two schools Tuesday and all 11 of Selma's public
schools Wednesday.
   Roussell was reinstated after initial protests. But students and
other protesters want the school board to extend his contract,
which expires June 30.
   Roussell said Sunday he was not sure how long schools will
remain closed, backing off an announcement last week that they
would reopen Monday. He said he must meet with the school board to
decide the matter and has not been able to do so.
   Rose Sanders, a Selma attorney and one of the protesters, said
she was injured as a result of police brutality during a melee at
Smitherman's office Monday. A preliminary city report said
allegations of police brutality at the protest were unfounded.
   Mrs. Sanders said at a rally at the high school later Sunday
that the federal courts should not be used to undermine civil
rights protesters.
   ``I am willing for my children to lose a year in school so their
children won't have to go through this 25 years from now,'' she
said.
   Protesters had planned both Saturday and Sunday to walk from a
Selma church to the Edmund Pettus Bridge, a landmark in the civil
rights movement of the 1960s, but organizers later changed the
routes.
   Chestnut said Sunday he did not see any sign from Smitherman or
other white community leaders that the protests will lead to any
changes.
   ``I don't think you've ever had good faith on both sides of the
controversy,'' Chestnut said.

<HEAD>PLO Reported Agreeing To Peace Talks, Shamir's Party Torn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The PLO secretly endorsed a U.S. plan for
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue, a leading newspaper reported Sunday
on the eve of a meeting that could decide Israel's next steps in
the Middle East peace process.
   The meeting Monday of the 3,500-member Central Committee of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc is aimed at ending a
power struggle in the right-wing party that has halted peace
efforts by Israel's Likud-Labor coalition government.
   The Haaretz newspaper said the Palestine Liberation Organization
agreed to proposals by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
aimed at setting up elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip of Palestinian representatives to peace talks.
   A text of the agreement was placed on Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens' desk last week, the newspaper said.
   It said agreement was reached on three key points: names of
Palestinian delegates to a preliminary meeting with Israelis in
Cairo, Egypt, the agenda for those talks and the method for
announcing the delegates' names. No further details were given.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman denied knowledge of the document,
saying, ``We are not aware of any such report on his (Arens')
desk.''
   Israel Television said two senior Baker aides are to leave for
Cairo Monday to prepare a meeting of the Israeli, U.S. and Egyptian
foreign ministers as the first step toward the Israeli-Palestinian
dialogue.
   Shamir's top aide, Yossi Ben-Aharon, said he was not aware of
plans for such a meeting in Cairo but confirmed Arens was due to
meet with Baker in the next few days.
   Palestinians have been waging a 26-month-old revolt against
Israeli rule of the occupied lands.
   In violence Sunday, Adnan Assaf, 45, died of gunshot wounds
inflicted by soldiers in a clash in the West Bank town of Qabatiyah
on Friday, Arab reports said. The army confirmed his death and said
it was checking the circumstances.
   Assaf's death raised to 655 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians during the uprising. At least 181
other Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs as suspected
collaborators, and 43 Israelis also have died.
   At Monday's Likud meeting, Shamir demands a single vote of
confidence in his leadership and his peace plan for elections in
the occupied territories. Hard-liners want several votes on
controversial issues that threaten to split the party or even bring
down the government.
   ``I have no compromise formula, apart from the evident one: Let
the Central Committee decide what agenda it prefers,'' Shamir said
Sunday.
   The squabble has produced two weeks of mudslinging between
Shamir and Likud hawks, but some analysts said the battle could
still end in a compromise, as did a Likud rift last July. Then,
Shamir delivered a hard-line speech in exchange for his opponents
refraining from speaking.
   Shamir's initiative was approved by the government last May amid
American and European pressures to begin peace talks. The plan
calls for negotiations with elected Palestinians on interim
self-rule for the West Bank and Gaza. Later talks would decide the
final status of the occupied lands.
   But progress toward the elections of those representatives has
been slow, partly because Likud hard-liners have repeatedly tried
to undercut the plan, warning it could lead to an independent
Palestinian state.

<TEXT>
   Developer Donald Trump is ending his 12-year
marriage to Ivana Trump because ``it just wasn't working out,'' a
spokesman for the tycoon said Sunday.
   The developer told his wife last Tuesday before he left for a
business trip to Tokyo that he was leaving her, said the spokesman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``They have a prenuptial agreement, and Mrs. Trump will receive
their house in Connecticut and approximately $20 million,'' the
spokesman said.
   ``Mr. Trump said that, while Ivana is a wonderful woman, it just
wasn't working out,'' the spokesman said.
   Word of a split by the famous couple was first reported Sunday
by Daily News columnist Liz Smith.
   ``While friends hope for a reconciliation, many sources tell
this columnist that attorneys have already been engaged to divide
the spoils,'' Smith wrote, citing unidentified sources.
   Forbes magazine says Trump is worth around $1.7 billion, ranking
him 19th on its 1989 list of America's 400 richest people.
   Mrs. Trump, a socialite and former model, used to manage the
Trump Castle casino and has been in charge of renovations at the
Plaza Hotel in New York City.
   Her pay for the Plaza job, Trump said, was ``one dollar plus all
the dresses she can buy.'' She refers to him as ``The Donald.''
   Two months ago, Mrs. Trump said, ``I'm very happy. We have
wonderful children, houses, wealth, a good marriage.''
   The couple has three children. The spokesman did not know if any
custody arrangements had been made regarding the children.
   The Trumps' holdings also include the Grand Hyatt Hotel and the
flashy Trump Tower, where they have a penthouse, in New York City;
the Trump Plaza and Taj Mahal in Atlantic City; the Trump Plaza in
Palm Beach, Fla.; the Trump Shuttle, formerly Eastern Airlines'
Northeast shuttle; a yacht, the 282-foot Trump Princess; a 45-room
country home in Greenwich, Conn.; and the 150-room Mar-a-Largo
mansion in Palm Beach.

   The living room of Nelson Mandela's
daughter erupted in yells, tears and fists clenched in salute
Sunday morning when South Africa's most famous prisoner walked free.
   ``When I saw him walk there, oh, I was just so excited. To see
him walk out tall in a dignified way, it's just so wonderful to
look at him,'' said Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah.
   ``It's an experience that will live for me forever. I was really
elated, overjoyed, happy. I really can't express it. It was my
father, seeing my father,'' she said.
   The 36-year-old anthropologist, a Fulbright Scholar at the
University of Massachusetts, spoke in her apartment filled with
television gear to catch her first glimpse of freedom for her
father, imprisoned since she was 8 years old.
   The release of Mandela, 71, has been rumored for months, but
nothing compared with actually seeing ``the father that I have
never had. I see him there and I see the possibility for me to be
reunited,'' she said.
   ``It's just so inspiring to me. I really never expected this
moment, this day to come about,'' she said.
   Another Mandela daughter, Zenani Mandela-Dlamini, a 31-year-old
student at Boston University, appeared Sunday night at a church
service in Boston celebrating her father's release.
   ``Today is a very special day for us as members of the Mandela
family. A victory has been won by our people,'' her husband,
Thumbumuzi Dlamini, 39, said on behalf of the family at the service
at the Cathedral of St. Paul.
   Dlamini urged hundreds of people gathered at the service to
continue the struggle against apartheid.
   ``There's still much more work to be done and much more
victories to be won,'' he said.
   Mandela-Amuah plans to return home this summer and hopes to
start getting to know her father. Until then, she will stay in
Amherst where she lives with her three children and her husband,
Isaac, also is a doctoral student at UMass.
   Mandela-Amuah said she fears for her father's safety and is also
concerned about the intense scrutiny he will face as he copes with
the reality of being a black leader after 27 years in prison as a
symbolic figure.
   And, she said, she hope Americans won't interpret her father's
release as the end to South African blacks' struggle for equality.
   ``This is only the first step, a little step, and we should not
forget this,'' she said. ``The battle is not over. It's only
starting at a renewed, higher level.''
   Mandela's other daughter in the United States, Zenani
Mandela-Dlamini, 31, a student at Boston University, could not be
reached by telephone Sunday at her home and did not attend a
scheduled morning gathering in Cambridge.
   She and her husband, Thumbumuzi, and three children were
scheduled to fly to South Africa early this week to be reunited
with her father. ``This is what we've worked for all these years,''
she told reporters Saturday.
   In Boston on Sunday, Patrick Lekota, publicity secretary for the
United Democratic Front and a former political prisoner who was
jailed with Mandela, said Mandela's release will bring stability
and strength to his cause.
   Lekota said the next steps for the anti-apartheid movement are
to gain the release of other political prisoners and to begin
negotiations to form a new constitution for the country.
   Mandela will meet with his comrades to map out plans for the
apartheid resistance. ``Nelson is not an individualist,'' Lekota
said. ``He's a team worker. He will meet with the movement to
decide what the next steps are.''

<HEAD>Reformers Break Away From Communist Party, Form Own Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Communist Party faction impatient with
the pace of reform broke away Sunday and formed its own party.
   The Alternative Socialist Party, in its founding declaration,
called for private enterprise and limited government control of the
economy.
   The official BTA news agency reported that as many as 600 people
joined the new party.
   ``The Alternative Socialist Party will consider socialism not as
a social system but as an inevitable trend in the development of
civilization,'' said the declaration, signed by 30 intellectuals
who left the Communist Party.
   The new party was formed from the Alternative Socialist
Organization during a meeting to consider whether or not to remain
in the mainstream of the ruling Communist Party.
   According to the declaration, read at the conference by Nikolai
Vassilev, the leader of the Alternative Socialist Organization, the
new party will seek allies among the ``radical and reform forces of
the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Agrarian Party, the
Social-Democratic Party and all democratic movements in the
country,'' BTA reported.
   The meeting came less than two weeks after a key Communist Party
Congress that chose moderate reformer Alexander Lilov as party
chief and sought to present a more progressive image.
   The party under Lilov's predecessor Petar Mladenov, who took
over from longtime hard-line leader Todor Zhivkov in November, had
made some moves toward reform, including renouncing its
constitutionally guaranteed leading role.
   During the four-day party congress, Lilov and other top
officials said the party had parted with Stalinism and was
embarking on a road of ``socialist democracy.''
   But members of the new party said the Communist Party was not
moving fast enough on reform. Speakers at Sunday's meeting
criticized the party congress and the slow pace of change.
   Speakers who called for the formation of the Alternative
Socialist Party received resounding applause from the 3,000
participants.
   Vassilev, a philosophy professor at Sofia University, said the
party's founding congress will be held by next month.

<HEAD>``60 Minutes'' Anchorman Says Rooney Could Never Have Made Remarks

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``60 Minutes'' anchorman Mike Wallace took the
opportunity during the television news magazine's broadcast Sunday
to put some distance between the program and suspended humorist
Andy Rooney.
   Rooney last week was placed on three months' suspension after
racist comments were attributed to him in a gay publication.
   ``Even though the remarks attributed to Andy were not made on
`60 Minutes' _ and indeed could never have been made on `60
Minutes' _ this is the broadcast with which he has been most
closely associated,'' Wallace said.
   ``After his three-month suspension, which he himself has
acknowledged is understandable, we, who have been his colleagues
through the years, surely look forward to his return here.''
   In a story published this weekend in The Advocate, a biweekly
magazine based in Los Angeles, Rooney is quoted as saying blacks
have watered down their genes ``because the less intelligent ones
are the ones that have the most children.''
   Rooney, who won his first Emmy award in 1968 for his script for
a special about blacks, flatly denied making the remarks, but said
he would rather accept the suspension than end his career at CBS.

   Record price increases for vegetables and fuel
oil combined in January to produce the highest monthly wholesale
inflation rate in 15 years, the government reported, but analysts
attributed almost all of it to the holiday cold snap.
   The Labor Department said Friday its Producer Price Index soared
a seasonally adjusted 1.8 percent last month, the sharpest rise
since a 2 percent gain in November 1974, in the midst of the OPEC
oil embargo.
   January energy prices rocketed ahead 13.6 percent for the
largest monthly gain since 1974. Food costs jumped 2.1 percent,
their biggest increase in six years.

quarterly refunding auction.
   The newly issued 30-year government bond surged 1 25-32 points
Friday, or $17.81 for every $1,000 in face value, from its level at
Thursday's auction. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction, tumbled to 8.33 percent from 8.50 percent.
   The jump in the price of the long bond, the most widely watched

German governments denied that collapse is imminent.
   A top official in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, speaking
privately, said earlier Friday the decline, fueled by worker
exodus, widespread strikes and high absenteeism at many industrial
sites, has accelerated to the point that ``insolvency could be
within a few days.''
   Kohl will discuss the need for immediate aid in the ``billions

   Daniel P. Kearney, a key official in the
savings and loan bureaucracy, quit after only four months on the
job, dealing another blow to President Bush's dissension-plagued
bailout program.
   Kearney is the chief staff officer of the Resolution Trust Corp.
Oversight Board, created to monitor the progress of and set the
policy for government rescues of saving and loans.
   The job ``does not currently afford me the authority that I
believe is essential to be effective in this process,'' Kearney
said Friday.

   Gibraltar Financial Corp. has filed
for protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law, nearly
a year after regulators seized its main unit, Gibraltar Savings.
   Gibraltar Chairman James N. Thayer said Friday the thrift
holding company was forced to make the filing Thursday to dissolve
a claim against its assets by Bank of America, the trustee for the
holders of $99.5 million in unsecured Gibraltar bonds.
   Thayer also said the move was prompted in part by the
government's seizure of two of the company's savings and loan
subsidiaries in March 1989.

   A Food and Drug Administration proposal to
limit food health claims was praised as ''a major victory for
consumers,'' but one industry group called portions of the plan a
``bureaucratic nightmare.''
   Allen Goldberg of the Grocery Manufacturers Association on
Friday praised the FDA for moving ahead on health claims, but said
the plan was ``unacceptable in its current form.''
   He called a requirement for FDA clearance of health claims ``a
bureaucratic nightmare'' and said the need for scientific agreement
on a health benefit before a claim can be made is unfair.

   On Anika Polzin's first trip outside her native
East Germany in November her parents bought her a Barbie doll.
   Now on her second excursion to the western world the
six-year-old is getting wined and dined _ make that milkshaked and
hamburgered _ by Barbie's corporate parents.
   Mattel Inc., manufacturer of the famous fashion doll, brought
Miss Polzin and her family over for a five-day holiday in New York.
They will be guests at a black-tie affair Mattel is hosting tonight
to mark the beginning of the annual American International Toy Fair
and to announce what the company is calling the ``Barbie Summit.''
   Patricia Wyatt, director of marketing for girls toys at Mattel,
said the company thought it was fitting to have Miss Polzin on hand
when they revealed plans for the event that is to be held each year
starting with the first three-day conference in New York during the
week of Nov. 19. Essay contests will be held for girls of varying
ages to compete to become ``delegates.''
   ``Through Barbie we want to bring children from around the world
together,'' Ms. Wyatt said, speaking in the almost reverential
tones Mattel people use in referring to a toy that has been a
must-have for many little girls since being introduced 31 years ago.
   Mattel reckons that enough Barbies have been sold in the doll's
lifetime that if placed head to toe they would circle the earth 3{
times. Sales of the dolls plus her entourage and their
accouterments exceeded $450 million in 1988 and accounted for 40
percent of Hawthorne, Calif.-based Mattel's total revenue.
   The summit will ``give children a forum to express their
viewpoints'' ... and ``help them share their different cultures
with one another,'' Ms. Wyatt said in an interview.
   A new Barbie Summit doll _ appropriately available in four
ethnic distinctions _ outfitted in a shimmering white ensemble will
debut at Toy Fair, an annual trade show. Proceeds from sales of the
doll will be placed in a Barbie Fund, which Mattel will donate to
children's charities.
   The towheaded Miss Polzin was tuckered out Friday afternoon from
a busy day of sightseeing, shopping and a visit to Rumpelmayer's
Restaurant, a favorite Manhattan watering hole with the young,
ice-cream eating set. But she handled an interview at her Waldorf
Astoria suite with admirable aplomb and smiled sweetly for
photographs.
   It was a picture of a beaming Anika clutching a new Barbie that
first attracted Mattel's attention.
   ``We were very moved by the photo,'' Ms. Wyatt said. ``It was
nice to know that Barbie transcended cultures.''
   The caption on the photo, which appeared in newspapers around
the world, gave her name and hometown, Schwanefeld, East Germany.
It said she was photographed after a day of western-style shopping
in Helmstedt, West Germany.
   Mattel's German affiliates easily tracked down Miss Polzin. Only
a few inquiries were needed to trace her in Schwanefeld, a tiny
village, population 270, a few miles from the border with West
Germany.
   Miss Polzin, wearing a new dress and complementing hot-pink
tights, said through an interpreter that she was enjoying her trip
to the United States.
   But signs of jet lag were still evident as she sat on a sofa
beside Minnie Mouse. She and her 10-year-old brother, Maik, and
parents, Eva and Inglof, who works for the East German railroad,
arrived late Thursday night from Frankfurt on a flight courtesy of
Lufthansa airlines.
   They already had been to the Statue of Liberty, and outings to
the Empire State Building, museums and, of course, FAO Schwarz were
planned.

<HEAD>Environmental Protection Should Not Hamper Free Trade, Experts Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Measures to protect the
environment should not jeopardize worldwide economic growth, a
high-level panel of experts said here Sunday.
   ``There is no doubt that it is totally irresponsible to further
postpone forceful measures'' to contain further damage to the
earth's environment, said Emile van Lennep, a former
Secretary-General of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD).
   ``But such measures should not lead to any unfair competition on
the world's markets,'' said Van Lennep, a member of a group of
experts that met here to draw up a report for the InterAction
Council.
   The Council, founded seven years ago and chaired by former West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, is a loosely-knit association of
30 former heads of government who meet annually to discuss
environmental issues such as population growth, deforestation, and
energy supplies.
   Among the participants at the weekend meeting, which was in
preparation of next May's annual meeting in Seoul, South Korea,
were former British Prime Minister Lord Callaghan and Miguel de la
Madrid, the former Mexican president.
   ``An important task for governments in the coming decade will be
to take care of environmental conservation and at the same time see
to it such conservatory measures will not be detrimental to
economic growth,'' Van Lennep said.
   And he said that the group of experts here ``emphasized that the
pricing instrument should be used as much as possible ... so that
the environmental cost of a given product is reflected in its
price.''
   Van Lennep said the experts voiced ``grave reservations''
against government subsidies to their local industries to cushion
the effect of environmental costs on their products' pricing.
   The former OECD chief said the experts also would recommend a
huge transfer of funds to Third World and Eastern European nations
to gear their industries to environmental needs.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia's annual economic
growth rate slowed to 1.7 percent last year while some six percent
of the country`s citizens live close to the poverty line, a
newspaper said.
   ``The annual growth dynamics of the GNP slowed to 1.7 percent,
down from 2.8 percent, according to preliminary estimates,'' Mlada
Fronta quoted the official federal statistics report as saying.
   The newspaper on Saturday said the average growth rate in
industrialized countries is estimated at 3.6 percent.
   Czechoslovakia's national income _ the rough equivalent of GNP _
is 58O billion crowns, or some $34 billion, the report said. The
crown cannot be converted freely into dollars or other Western
currencies.
   The report said high energy consumption in Czechoslovakia's
inefficient economy as well as the sharply reduced output of the
country's military industry contributed to the growth slowdown.
   Vast amounts of idle stock, roughly equivalent to one year's
GNP, also have slowed the economy, Mlada Fronta said.
   ``In 1988, there were ... almost 900,000 people whose average
per capita income was lower than 1,000 Czechoslovak crowns ($59) _
that's on the verge of the poverty line, '' the newspaper said.
   The average monthy income for Czechoslovakia's 15.5 million
population is 3,200 crowns ($188), up by 2.4 percent in 1989 from
the previous year, the report said.
   Czechoslovakia's centrally planned economy, which has timidly
introduced some elements of market mechanism in recent years, so
far failed to produce notable results.

<HEAD>Largest Offshore Bank To Channel Profits to Loan Loss Fund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arab Banking Corp., Bahrain's largest
offshore bank, said it was setting aside its entire 1989 profit of
$132 million to cover potential loan losses.
   ABC, which is owned by the governments of Kuwait, Libya and Abu
Dhabi, said Sunday the addition to its loan-loss reserve was needed
to reassure investors because the bank is planning a $250-million
share offering to boost its capital by 25 percent.
   Troubles with the bank's Latin American loan portfolio helped
cause interest income to fall 14 percent to $327 million in 1989
from $380 million in 1988.
   The drop largely reflected non-payment of interest by Brazil and
Argentina, said Abdullah Saudi, the bank's president and chief
executive.
   The drop in interest income was offset in part by an increase in
fees and commissions, which rose 30 percent to $179 million last
year from $138 million in 1988.
   Operating profit before taxes, minority items and loan loss
provisions fell to $184 million in 1989 from $239 million.
   Saudi said the addition to reserves would boost the bank's
provisions for doubtful loans to about 40 percent of its loan
portfolio.
   Saudi said the $250-million share issue planned for the first
half of this year will be listed in the Bahrain, Kuwait and
Luxembourg stock exchanges.
   Funds raised through the share issue will go in part toward the
setting up of a new ABC European subsidiary, Saudi said.
   The new company, provisionally named ABC Europe, will take care
of ABC branches in Paris, Milan and London. It is likely to be
based in London.
   Saudi said he hoped the bank also would expand in the Arab world.

<HEAD>Fast Food, Soft Drink Industries Register Support for Recycling
Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fast-food and soft drink giants, expecting to be
called on to help solve the nation's solid waste problem, are
taking the unusual stance of supporting taxes on themselves in that
endeavor.
   Companies such as Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers Inc., McDonald's
Corp., PepsiCo Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. are the leading users of
polystyrene food containers, aluminum cans and plastic and glass
bottles.
   And they have been feeling enough heat from consumers concerned
about the garbage choking the nation's landfills to suggest a tax
on themselves by a government they believe will eventually tax them
anyway.
   In the last few months, representatives of the companies have
been working to draft proposals for legislation that would place a
levy on their own use of unrecycled materials.
   ``We're trying to find a way to encourage recycling on a
national level,'' said Malcolm Chester, vice president of public
affairs for Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers, a subsidiary of
Chicago-based Whitman Corp. and the country's largest independent
soft drink bottler.
   But Paul Risley, an aide to Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., head of
the subcommittee planning hearings on the 1990 Clean Air Act, said
the companies are drawing up their own proposals because they're
``afraid of'' what might be included in a renewal of the Recycling
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1980.
   The Bush administration had been expected to put specific
recycling provisions in its budget proposal _ possibly a ``user
fee'' or tax on virgin materials produced by paper mills, plastic
plants, steel mills and glass manufacturers.
   But Senate sources said the administration would concentrate
first on getting the Clean Air Act passed by early summer.
   ``If the federal government doesn't come with something this
year, it may be too late,'' said Sal Porazzo, director of
environmental affairs at Pepsi-Cola Co., whose parent company also
owns the Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains.
   ``It's already happening at the state level,'' Porazzo said.
   About 10 percent of all beer and soft drink containers are being
recycled, but ``the number is moving up rapidly,'' said Chester, of
Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers.
   About 64 percent of the country's growing mountain of solid
waste is paper and paperboard, metals, glass and plastics,
according to Pepsi-Cola.
   Although Pepsi-Cola claims that soft drink and fast-food
containers account for only 2.25 percent of that sold waste after
recycling, the public still sees them as the biggest solid waste
problem.
   Coca-Cola is talking with the retail grocery trade and
congressional staff members about ``several proposals, including
fess for the use of virgin material,'' said spokesman Randy
Donaldson. ``We're laying out alternatives and getting feedback.''
   Oak Brook-based McDonald's, the largest fast-food chain, is
talking to its suppliers about user fees for unrecycled materials
as well, said spokesman Armando Ojeda.
   Ojeda said the chain, which recently announced plans to recycle
waste from 450 restaurants in five New England states, would like
to see action on the user fees at a national level.

<HEAD>Travelers' Profits Increase Eightfold but Company to Restructure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Travelers Corp. recorded an eightfold
increase in profits for 1989 despite a 40 percent decline in the
fourth quarter, the company said.
   Higher earnings for the year resulted partly from improved
results in employee benefits and asset management and pension
services. But personal property-casualty insurance, which includes
auto and homeowners' lines, lost $12.7 million last year, the
company reported Friday.
   Facing mounting losses in personal insurance, the company said
it would restructure the operations and become choosier about where
it sells coverage.
   Net income for 1989 rose to $455 million, or $4.37 a share, from
$55 million, or 44 cents a share, for 1988.
   Fourth quarter net income dropped to $149 million, or $1.42 a
share, from $250 million, or $2.47 a share, in 1988.
   Catastrophe losses from Hurricane Hugo, the San Francisco
earthquake and other disasters totaled $86 million in 1989,
compared with $21 million from similar disasters in 1988.
   Fourth-quarter earnings in 1989 include gains of $56 million
from the sale of Keystone Group Inc. and $20 million of losses from
catastrophes. In the 1988 final quarter, profits included $107
million of gains from the sale of several businesses and investment
properties and $7 million of catastrophe losses.
   Revenues for 1989 totaled $12.5 billion, up from $12.3 billion a
year ago. Premiums were $7.8 billion, the same as in 1988.
   Fourth quarter revenues totaled $3.2 billion, compared with $3
billion in the 1988 quarter. Premiums rose to $1.9 billion from
$1.6 billion.
   Travelers said the net loss of nearly $13 million in 1989 in
personal property-casualty lines compared with $29 million of net
income in 1988. Catastrophe claims and regulators' restrictions on
price increases contributed to the 1989 loss, said Edward H. Budd,
chairman and chief executive officer.
   Under the restructuring announced Friday, some jobs will be cut,
field offices will be consolidated and the number of independent
agents selling Travelers' consumer insurance lines will be reduced.

   Loral Defense Systems in Akron says it will
eliminate 100 jobs and discontinue its electronics assembly
operation on April 13.
   The company informed union officials of the job cuts Friday.
   Loral Defense Systems, the Akron area's eighth-largest employer,
is a unit of Loral Corp. of New York, the nation's 35th-largest
defense contractor.
   Loral last month threatened to move the electronics assembly
workers' jobs to an area with cheaper labor costs if the union did
not agree to contract concessions. The company said it needed to
improve its ability to compete.
   Loral employs about 320 hourly and 1,600 salaried workers in
Akron.
   UAW Local 856 President Tom Seese said the union refused Loral's
demands that workers take a 50 percent reduction in their pay and
benefits package. They are making about $24 an hour in combined
wages and fringe benefits.

<HEAD>Chrysler Planning More Salaried Work Force Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. said Sunday it will cut deeper
into its salaried work force as it continues with an accelerated
cost-cutting program.
   The nation's No. 3 automaker in October announced a program
designed to carve $1 billion in costs from its $26 billion budget
by the end of 1990. At that time, Chrysler said 2,300 salaried
employees, or 8 percent of its 31,000-member white-collar work
force, would be removed from its payroll.
   Chrysler spokesman Steve Harris said Sunday that more
white-collar workers would be cut through attrition. He said he
couldn't say how many positions the company planned to eliminate,
and he knew of no plans for further layoffs.
   Automotive News, a weekly industry journal, quoted unidentified
sources in its Monday's editions as saying the new round of cuts
would remove 5 percent to 10 percent of the company's salaried work
force, in addition to those announced in October.
   ``White-collar reductions are becoming a way of life at
Chrysler,'' Harris said. ``A certain part will come through
attrition.''
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have said they, like
Chrysler, constantly are reviewing their employment levels. In
1987, GM began its ``Action Plan,'' to cut costs. Since then, its
original target has been raised to $13 billion by 1991.
   Ford has no formal cost-cutting plan similar to GM's or
Chrysler's.
   The automakers will give better pictures of changes in their
employment levels later this week when they report 1989 earnings.
   The latest salaried work-force reduction at Chrysler is likely
to be met favorably on Wall Street, said auto analyst Thomas
O'Grady, president of Integrated Automotive Resources Inc. of
Wayne, Pa.
   ``What I would be concerned about is what they are doing with
the savings,'' he said Sunday. ``If it is just to have a better
bottom line, that's not so good.''
   He suggested that the company funnel the money into product
development. There was no indication from Harris about where the
savings would be sent, but if the job cuts were part of the overall
cost-reduction program, it would be unlikely that product
development would get much.
   Auto analyst Steve Girsky of PaineWebber Inc. in New York City
said the newest cuts should be well received.
   ``I think this company is serious about slimming down,'' he said.
