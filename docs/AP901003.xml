   As East Germany disappeared on Wednesday, the
Soviet Union moved to officially end its relations with the former
nation and transfer bilateral agreements to the united Germany.
   The Supreme Soviet voted 303-23, with 35 abstentions, to adopt a
resolution ``taking under consideration'' an East German proposal
to annul a 1975 treaty governing relations with the Soviet Union.
   It was not clear whether the resolution actually ended the
treaty or if further action would be needed. The official news
agency Tass interpreted the vote as a cancellation of the treaty.
   First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Kovalev told the lawmakers
that in the coming 18 months, all the ``legal heritage'' between
the Soviet Union and East Germany will turn into mutual obligations
with the united Germany.
   The treaty covers security matters as well as economic,
financial and cultural cooperation.
   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze has said the treaty would
cover cooperation in trade, science, technology and Soviet troops
stationed in East Germany.
   Moscow plans to withdraw the 370,000 Red Army troops on former
East German territory within the next four years.

   An outbreak of food-poisoning, apparently
salmonella, sent 85 more conventioneers to hospitals Wednesday,
just two days after more than 200 people became sick from the same
outbreak, authorities said.
   At least two people were in intensive care, but a hospital
spokeswoman said their lives were not in danger.
   ``It would certainly seem to be a salmonella problem, even
though we don't have confirmation numbers anywhere near complaint
numbers,'' said Mike McCarthy, a spokesman for the Chicago Health
Department.
   Most of those stricken by food poisoning were conventioneers
attending the annual meeting of True Value Hardware Stores.
   At Grant Hospital, where 70 patients were examined Wednesday,
preliminary results of laboratory tests had determined 10 patients
admitted earlier this week were suffering from salmonella, said
Ginny Sharp, a hospital spokeswoman.
   Other hospitals also probably had reached similar findings but
hadn't yet notified the department, McCarthy said.
   ``At this particular time, we have not determined what substance
may have been the agent,'' added McCarthy.
   Ms. Sharp said the two patients in intensive care were there
``because they have some previous condition that made their
situation worse.''
   She said the hospital was describing their condition as fair to
serious, which means some vital signs are not stable.
   McCarthy said the primary target of the department's
investigation was a buffet dinner the conventioneers ate Sunday
night at the Hyatt Regency-Chicago. He said authorities also were
checking into a meal served Monday at the headquarters of True
Value's parent company, Cotter &amp; Co.
   Ambulances were dispatched to the Hyatt Regency and the Swiss
Grand hotels Wednesday to take the latest victims to the hospitals,
said Fire Department spokesman Mike Cosgrove.
   The Mid-America chapter of the American Red Cross said 85 people
were taken to hospitals Wednesday. Spokeswoman Randi Killian said
she did not know how many of those were admitted to hospitals. Nor
did she know their conditions.
   McCarthy said the people who became sick Monday and Wednesday
were suffering from the same food-poisoning incident, not a second
one.
   ``These people either had original symptoms that declined and
then flared up again, or they did not go for examination or
treatment originally,'' he said.
   Symptoms of the salmonella bacteria include nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea and fever. Patients must take care to avoid dehydration,
McCarthy said.
   Because salmonella has 1,400 strains, hospitals will forward
test results to the state's public health laboratory, which will
classify the strain, he said.
   Tim Hadac, another Chicago Health Department spokesman, said the
Hyatt Regency kitchen was inspected, ``came up clean'' and was
allowed to stay open.
   Food served at the Hyatt Regency's Sunday dinner included
lettuce with a cream-style dressing, deviled eggs with salami,
chicken stuffed with wild rice and spinach, mixed vegetables and
bread pudding with cream sauce.
   ``At this point we don't have any reason to believe it's
Hyatt,'' Nancy Ruth, a spokeswoman for the hotel, said Wednesday.
   Still, she said, the hotel was taking some voluntary
precautions. ``Food handlers who worked the function Sunday have
been furloughed with pay until their test results come in.''
   She said the hotel also was having its kitchen staff checked for
any food-borne viruses.
   ``We also have a staff microbiologist who ... is monitoring the
kitchen and the food-preparation procedures to be sure that the
standards of the Illinois Department of Health are either met or
exceeded,'' she said.

   Tropical storm Josephine, downgraded last week to a
tropical depression, made a resurgence Wednesday, while the
Atlantic hurricane season's 11th named storm, Klaus, formed off the
Leeward Islands.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Josephine's center was near 28.3 north
latitude and 42.4 west longitude, or about 1,150 miles southwest of
Terceira in the Azores islands off the coast of Portugal.
   Josephine, which had top winds of 50 mph, was moving westward
near 6 mph and was expected to turn to the northwest on Thursday,
according to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in
suburban Coral Gables. Little additional strengthening was expected
through Thursday.
   Meanwhile, Klaus was traveling northwest at the same speed and
strength as Josephine. It was centered at 16.7 north latitude and
60 west longitude, or about 110 miles east southeast of Antigua.
   Forecasters also expected little change in Klaus' strength with
its northwest motion likely to continue Thursday.
   Tropical depressions become storms when their maximum sustained
winds reach 39 mph.

<HEAD>Former Tehran Hostage Dead of Cancer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leland J. Holland, who as military attache
became one of the hostages seized in the 1979 takeover of the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran, is dead of cancer.
   Holland, 63, died at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on Tuesday.
   He had retired from the Army as a colonel in 1986. He had
commanded the Army's Vint Hill Station in Warrenton, Va., a
communications station, after his release along with 51 other
Americans from 444 days of captivity on Jan. 20, 1981.
   A veteran of two tours of duty in Vietnam, Holland described in
a 1988 article for The Washington Post the beatings and
psychological pressure of captivity and his Vietnam combat duty,
and wrote, ``So believe me, I know what it's like to have anenemy.
   ``But then the cancer thing came up. Cancer is an invisible
enemy, and I didn't know how to fight back.''
   He said he refused to ``worry myself to death'' and ``I'm still
paying attention to the weather report.''
   He is survived by his wife, four sons and two daughters.

   A teen-age boy who didn't want his mother to
know he'd been hit by a train walked home while police searched the
tracks for a body.
   The 15-year-old boy was hospitalized in good condition with a
puncture and abrasion on his thigh and a possible broken arm, said
Officer Fred Weiner, a police spokesman.
   The boy told police he had been talking to a friend when he was
sideswiped by the Long Island Rail Road train Wednesday evening in
the New York City borough of Queens, Weiner said.
   The train engineer thought he hit someone, and the train was
stopped for 75 minutes while police looked for the victim, railroad
spokesman Terry Brown said.
   The boy, whom police would not identify because of his age, went
home and told his mother he'd been hurt but didn't tell her how,
Weiner said. The boy finally admitted what happened after she
called for an ambulance, Weiner said.

<HEAD>Study: Cholesterol-Lowering Surgery Saves Lives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol
of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart
attack or death from heart disease, researchers said today.
   The surgery, called a partial ileal bypass, has one significant
drawback: It causes chronic diarrhea that persists for years.
   In the operation, doctors change the route of the small
intestine so about one-third of it is bypassed. This reduces the
amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream.
   The $52 million, 17-year study was conducted on people who had
already suffered heart attacks. The approach lengthened the lives
of people who had very mild heart attacks but not those with more
severe heart damage.
   During an average of 10 years of follow up, the death rate among
surgery patients who had sustained minimal heart damage was 24
percent. In a comparison group without the intestinal surgery, it
was 39 percent.
   Dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directed
the study, said the surgery should be considered along with
cholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment.
   ``It has a role in the management of patients with high
cholesterol who have had a heart attack,'' Buchwald said. ``It is
eminently logical to extend all cholesterol-lowering therapy,
including this, to patients with high cholesterol who have not had
a heart attack.''
   Besides diarrhea, those who undergo the surgery are somewhat
more prone to have kidney stones, gallstones and intestinal
obstructions.
   The study was conducted in Minneapolis, Los Angeles,
Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and published in today's New
England Journal of Medicine.
   Despite wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering, doubts remain
about whether it actually helps people live longer if they already
have healthy hearts. Although the latest study was conducted
exclusively on people who had suffered heart attacks, Buchwald said
he believes the research should settle that question.
   ``It offers the strongest justification for marked lipid
(cholesterol) ineervention that has ever been offered,'' Buchwald
said. ``It is a very powerful study and should, except for certain
people who will never be satisfied, end the cholesterol
controversy.''
   In the study, 421 people who recovered from heart attacks
underwent the surgery, while a comparison group of 417 people were
treated with diet alone. At the start of the study, their average
cholesterol levels were 251. The surgery lowered people's
cholesterol 23 percent.
   The overall risk of dying from heart disease or suffering
another non-fatal heart attack was reduced 35 percent among the
surgical patients with the healthiest hearts. The surgical patients
also required less than half as many coronary bypass operations
because of clogged heart arteries.

<HEAD>Pre-Doubleday, Pre-Cartwright Account of Baseball Game Found</HEAD>

   Baseball historians were thrown a curve
Wednesday with a newspaper report that Alexander Cartwright
possibly wasn't the inventor of their game.
   The New York Times said that a newly discovered newspaper report
and box score show that other teams were already playing baseball
in New York City a year earlier than when Cartwright supposedly
invented the game in 1846.
   The story also reported that baseball probably evolved from a
number of enthusiasts in New York in the mid-1840s, rather than
springing fully formed from the imagination of anyone in
particular.
   According to the Times, which published the story in its
Thursday editions, the discovery was made by Edward L. Widmer, a
Harvard graduate student who was doing research for his doctoral
dissertation at the New York Historical Society.
   In a copy of The New York Morning News, Widmer reportedly found
an account of a game on Oct. 21, 1845, between the ``New York Ball
Club and a team from Brooklyn.'' Like the 1846 game credited by
historians as the first, the earlier game was played at the Elysian
Fields in Hoboken, N.J., then a bucolic area easily reachable from
Manhattan by ferry.
   The Morning News said that New York won 24-4, aided by a grand
slam, or in the vocabulary of the time, ``four aces'' off a single
hit.
   ``At the conclusion of the match, both parties sat down to a
dinner ...'', the newspaper reported, reflecting baseball's origins
as a social event between gentlemen.
   The account of the Oct. 21, 1845 game in The New York Morning
News indicates that the popularity of baseball was spreading
rapidly at the time. ``Two more Base clubs are already formed in
our sister city,'' Brooklyn, the story related.
   The Morning News did not say which rules were used, an important
question to specialists.
   In popular myth, baseball was invented in Cooperstown by Abner
Doubleday. Historians seeking the true progenitor have instead
credited Cartwright, a New York bank clerk, who is said to have
drawn up the rules and organized the first game in 1846 for the
Knickerbocker Base Ball Club at the Elysian Fields.

   The male prostitute whose relations with
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., sparked a House ethics committee
investigation and public reprimand, was arrested on assault charges
Wednesday, police said.
   Alexandria police arrested Stephen Gobie, 34, shortly after
midnight and charged him with misdemeanor assault and battery.
   He was released on his own recognizance and scheduled for a
trial in October.
   Authorities said the arrest followed a complaint and refused to
release further details.
   Frank was reprimanded by the House after concluding he broke its
rules by fixing 33 parking tickets that he and Gobie received.
   Gobie also was arrested earlier this year for allegedly
assaulting an off-duty District of Columbia police officer after a
traffic dispute. Those charges are still pending against him.

   Israeli soldiers are drawn as dogs and Jewish
settlers as rats toting rifles. As for the Arabs, they're depicted
as having sinister mustaches and jagged scars across their cheeks.
   The drawings are not the work of political cartoonists on one
side or other in the Arab-Israeli conflict. They are illustrations
for children's books meant to entertain and teach Palestinian or
Israeli youngsters.
   Professor Adir Cohen, author of a study of Hebrew children's
literature called ``An Ugly Face in the Mirror,'' says such books
give birth to lifelong hatreds among Israelis and Palestinians.
   ``We learned from Freud how stories and fairytales enter our
subconscious. ... It infiltrates to those places of the
subconscious and comes up repeatedly,'' said Cohen, head of the
education department at Haifa University.
   He described Arabs in Hebrew children's books as having ``a huge
terrible mustache and scary eyes, the nose of an eagle ... a scar
and a narrow forehead.''
   ``We are talking about processes of dehumanization that are
connected to the (Arab-Israeli) struggle, connected to defense and
wars,'' he said. ``It is much easier to fight a roach.''
   Cohen used as an example the typical detective stories for young
boys - who in a few years will be soldiers - in which the Israeli
hero battles Arab murderers, bandits or terrorists.
   In Avner Carmieli's ``The Young Detectives Settle in the Wild
Negev,'' a young hero overcomes hundreds of Arabs, among them
kings. He lines up his prisoners and strides up and down shouting:
   ``Left, left - faster Gamal, Abdul, Nasser! Straighten your
backs Hussein and Faisel! Look front Nuri a-Said!''
   The book goes on to explain how ``the kings and dictators and
leaders marched forward quickly'' under his orders. The names used
are typically Arab, but Gamal Abdul Nasser was also the late
Egyptian president who was one of Israel's chief enemies.
   Many of the Hebrew books with such messages are aimed at boys in
their pre-teens. Similar Arab literature is intended for even
younger readers who in other societies might be reading about fairy
princesses.
   In Nasser Abed Alaltif's ``The Flower Beauty Queen,'' Jewish
settlers in the occupied West Bank are pictured as rats wielding
rifles. Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin curls his dragon claws
over an Arab village in Hamdan Yusef's ``The Sad Times of Deir
Yassin.''
   Khawla Abu Bakr, author of a study called ``The Political
Socialization of Palestinian Children by Means of Arab Children's
Literature,'' says West Bank children's books have as many
stereotypes as Israeli works.
   ``The (Israeli) soldier is always depicted as a wolf, a chicken,
an elephant, dogs,'' she said. ``Human figures are always seen as
bureaucrats, inconsiderate officials, police who break arms or
cruel soldiers.''
   Abu Bakr, an Arab Israeli from the Jewish-Arab seaside town of
Akko, defended the stereotypes of Israeli soldiers as a reflection
of the Arab children's daily life.
   For example, she said, a story by Rawdeh Alhodhod called ``The
Secret of the Red Devils In El Bire'' tells of Arab boys on a trip
who are arrested after one of them throws a stone at an army jeep.
   Youngsters often have been at the forefront of the Palestinian
uprising that began in December 1987. Thousands of youngsters have
been arrested, and 158 Palestinian children aged 16 and under have
died of Israeli army or civilian gunfire.
   Palestinian children's books also make references to the real
world. The Deir Yassin mentioned in Hamdan Yusef's book was an Arab
village where more than 200 Palestinian men, women and children
were massacred by Jewish militiamen in 1948.
   Another feature of the Arab children's books is a clearly stated
moral. The story of the arrested boys concludes: ``Our enemy is not
the boy but the soldier. ... (The boy) is a hero and did nothing
wrong to be punished for. You have to suffer and be a man.''
   Cohen agreed that the intefadeh, or Palestinian uprising,
enforces the message in the Palestinian books, but he noted many
were published before the revolt. ``No doubt, had we known how to
read this literature correctly years ago we would have seen how
they were preparing for the intefadeh,'' he said.
   For his study, Cohen examined more than 500 Hebrew works and
interviewed hundreds of Jewish children to determine the influence
of the books. Abu Bakr studied 300 books written in Israel, the
West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt.
   Cohen said he hoped a new stream of Israeli children's
literature stressing coexistence would gain in readership. But he
added that adventure stories featuring Israeli heroes and wicked
Arabs remain more popular.
   Abu Bakr said stories without stereotypes are too much to expect
from an occupied people.
   She added that her favorite story was ``Hassan and the Monster''
by Taghred el Najer, which tells of a little boy who ignores
villagers' warnings and climbs a mountain to meet the one-eyed,
hairy monster who eats children.
   At the top, it's the monster who is frightened by the boy's
strange appearance - his two eyes and fair skin. Boy and monster
realize they can be friends, despite their differences and fears,
and they walk off together into the sunset.

   One of the bolder love scenes this movie
season won't make it to theaters.
   A frank encounter between two women - from ``Welcome Home, Roxy
Carmichael'' - was left on the cutting room floor. What remains is
a brief scene with two women in a bedroom, hinting elliptically at
their love making.
   Depictions are more explicit in the upcoming ``Henry and June,''
which details the sexual encounters of writer Henry Miller, his
wife, June, and writer Anais Nin in Paris in the 1930s. There are
scenes at lesbian social clubs in which women embrace, kiss and
dance together, and a brothel scene shows two women making love.
   Hollywood's continuing difficulty with homosexuality ranges from
the squeamishness of ``Roxy Carmichael'' to the rancor of ``Bird on
a Wire.'' In the latter film, a hairdresser swishes through his
salon in a wanton stereotype.
   Yet a swishy role won William Hurt an Oscar for his performance
as a homosexual prisoner in ``Kiss of the Spider Woman.''
   Critics say upcoming films will include negative gay role
models. The Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) says
the scripts for ``Basic Instinct'' and ``Ticking Man'' are littered
with villains who are gay. They say ``Basic'' features lesbian and
bisexual women as murderers and ``Ticking'' features a man
described as ``wierdly effeminate.''
   ``What we'd like to see is gay and lesbian characters portrayed,
I hope in continuing roles, as normal people,'' said Richard
Jennings, executive director of GLAAD's Los Angeles chapter. The
group is pleased with the character of a doctor's gay brother on
``Doctor, Doctor,'' on CBS.
   GLAAD has placed ads of protest in trade papers but plans no
boycotts of movies.
   A few recent releases have been criticized for allegedly
fostering anti-gay violence.
   GLAAD is unhappy with David Lynch's ``Wild at Heart,'' whose
lead uses the word ``faggot,'' and ``House Party,'' where a
character raps, ``Me a homo? Nah man, that's a no-no.''
   ITC Entertainment Group's ``Roxy Carmichael,'' distributed by
Paramount Pictures, is an account of a small town's memory of a
bisexul teen-age woman. The film attempted to deal
straightforwardly with sex between two women.
   ``But at test screenings people were kind of shocked to see the
two people in bed,'' said the film's director, Jim Abrahams. ``I
thought it was done pretty tastefully. ... I think we miscalculated
the reaction.''
   ``We're lucky (the scene) is in there at all,'' said
screenwriter Karen Leigh Hopkins. ``Paramount was very nervous
about it and wanted it cut. ... But there's nothing wrong with (two
women) being lovers. Roxy is the hero - and she's bisexual.''
   Negative, cliched characterizations have been a motion-picture
staple since 1915's ``The Birth of a Nation.'' Almost every group,
at one time or another, has censured the entertainment industry for
biased depictions.
   Some gays have been pleased with such films as the recent
``Longtime Companion,'' 1959's ``Suddenly, Last Summer'' and 1968's
``The Killing of Sister George.'' For the most part, though, gays
are unhappy.
   In an advertisement taken out in the Hollywood trade newspaper
Daily Variety last week, GLAAD said: ``Gay and lesbian film
characters are portrayed either as sissies or victims, or murderers
and twisted villains. We are verbally abused with offensive terms
such as `faggot' and `dyke.'
   ``This year's screen images of violence and abuse fuel a climate
of increasing ant-gay violence.''
   ``We felt that with the real flood of nothing but negative
images in films this year that we had to do something dramatic to
get the industry's attention,'' said Jennings.
   The New York City police department recorded 64 anti-gay crimes
through July, up 120 percent from the previous period in 1989.
According to research by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force
for 1989, there were more than 7,000 reported incidents of
harassment, intimidation, vandalism or bias-related violence
directed against gays, including 62 homicides.
   The makers of some films under attack say criticisms of gay
characters are overly emotional.
   ``I didn't realize the word `faggot' was derogatory,'' said
Steve Golin, a producer of the Samuel Goldwyn Co.'s ``Wild at
Heart.'' ``It's just a term that's in our vocabulary. The film
doesn't depict gay people in a negative context.''
   Others responsible for movies under fire say the depictions are
only meant to be humorous.
   And Reggie Hudlin, director of New Line Cinema's ``House
Party,'' said the denounced rap lyric ``is being taken out of
context. ... It's a scene where a kid gets put in jail. The musical
number is a way to defend him against the assault'' of rape.

   George Williams stood before the
memorial to the 270 people killed on Pan Am Flight 103, running his
hand over the engraved name of his only son.
   Rain pelted against the tombstones in Dryfesdale Cemetery just
outside ockerbie, but the 59-year-old American seemed oblivious to
discomfort.
   He carefully laid a bouquet of white chrysanthemums below the
sixth column of names etched on the granite monument. Then he stood
silently for several minutes, occasionally wiping his eyes.
   One of the names on that sixth column was George Waterson
Williams, known by his friends and family as Geordie.
   A 24-year-old U.S. Army first lieutenant had been stationed at
Bad Kreuznach, then West Germany. He was heading home to spend
Christmas with his parents and missed his direct flight to
Washington because of traffic on the autobahn. He boarded Pan
American Flight 103 bound for New York instead.
   That was Dec. 21, 1988, a day that forever changed the lives of
George and Judy Williams of Joppatowne, Md.
   A terrorist bomb exploded on the aircraft, showering wreckage on
this quiet Scottish town.
   Williams has since been an active member of U.S. Families of the
Victims of Pan Am 103, helping campaign to find out the truth about
the crash and improve airport security.
   He is the only American relative attending the first public
inquiry into the crash, which opened Monday and resumes today in
nearby Dumfries.
   ``I hope the lack of security then and now will be brought to
light so that it will help this tremendous feeling I have from
happening to anyone else,'' he said.
   ``You know, people say that time eases the pain of loss. Well,
that might be true for a pet. But losing a child, it just gets
worse every day. And I'll be fighting for justice as long as I have
left on this earth,'' he said.
   ``They committed the ultimate human rights violation on my son.
They took away a beautiful, patriotic young man who loved life,''
he said.
   ``This animal who did it deprived me and my wife of watching him
develop as a human being, and of any hope of grandchildren. My wife
is an only child. Her line ends with her and our son was an only
child so all reason for existence seems to have ceased.''
   The silver-haired ex-Marine, a Korean War veteran whose nickname
is ``Whip,'' is unwavering in his goal.
   ``I want people from Pan Am jailed, people from the government
censured and fired that were involved in the cover-up, and I want
the criminals executed,'' he said.
   On Tuesday afternoon, Williams made his third visit to
Lockerbie.
   First, he placed flowers beside two wilting bouquets and a
child's baseball cap on Sherwood Crescent where the plane's
fuel-laden wing section exploded. The crater it formed is now
covered with neatly clipped grass and the demolished homes are
being rebuilt.
   Then he went to the memorial on nearby Park Place, overlooking a
row of houses. Geordie was one of 67 victims found there.
   His father tearfully laid white chrysanthemums on the simple
plaque, then turned away for several minutes to regain his
composure as two chattering schoolgirls walked into one of the
houses.
   After Dryfesdale Cemetery, Williams went to the remembrance room
in the cemetery at Tundergarth Parish Church, about 5 miles from
Lockerbie, where the nose section fell.
   There, he fingered the page of a book with Geordie's name, one
page for each victim.
   Then, he wrote Geordie a note in the visitor's book telling him
that the U.S. House of Representatives had just passed legislation
to improve airline security and intelligence coordination on
terrorism.
   ``Senate next,'' he wrote.
   Williams said he is spending his son's insurance money on the
campaign. His wife is under psychiatric care. But he can't give up.
   ``If people ask why don't you get on with your life, I am ... by
making sure everyone else's children out there aren't blown out of
the sky - That's what we want,'' he said.
   ``When these low moments hit me, I sometimes think I've got to
quit this and relax ... but that lasts for only 20 or 30 seconds.
Then I grit my teeth. I know what my son would want me to do and
that's what I will do.''

   Scientists who studied thumb-sucking by fetuses
reported today that even in the womb, lefties are a distinct
minority.
   Ultrasound examinations indicated that only 12 of 224 fetuses
preferred sucking the left thumb. The rest favored the right thumb,
the scientists said.
   Repeated observations of 17 fetuses showed preference for a
particular thumb continued through pregnancy. The position of the
fetus did not affect thumb preference, the researchers said.
   The scientists, from Queen's University of Belfast in Northern
Ireland, reported their findings in a letter to the editor in
today's issue of the British journal Nature.
   ``One could speculate that although the initial bias is a result
of advanced right-sided neuromuscular development, its maintenance
results from reinforcing aspects of thumb-sucking,'' wrote Peter
Hepper, Sara Shahidullah and Raymond White of the university's
School of Psychology.
   They said the result supports the idea that genes determine
whether one is right- or left- handed, while questioning theories
that say stress during pregnancy or birth plays a role.
   Another researcher said in an interview the study does not argue
against a role for such stress in producing southpaws.
   The stress theory assumes that people are usually genetically
biased to be right-handed, but that difficulties such as prolonged
labor, undernourishment as a fetus or Caesarean section can affect
the nervous system and produce a left-hander instead, said
psychology professor Stanley Coren.
   Studies show the likelihood of being left-handed doubles if one
emerged from such a stressed birth or a difficult pregnancy, said
Coren, from the University of British Columbia at Vancouver.
   In addition, some left-handedness is thought to be genetic, he
said.
   The fetal preference for the right hand supports the idea that
people are usually biased to be right-handed, he said. But while
studies say about 15 percent of children younger than about age 10
are lefties, the fetal study found only about 5 percent favoring
that hand.
   ``They simply didn't find enough left-handers,'' Coren said.
``Where do all the extra left-handers come from?''
   One possibility is that some right-handed fetuses later shift to
the left hand because of stress in pregnancy or birth, he said.
   He also said the fetuses should be studied as children to make
sure their thumb-sucking behavior in the womb really predicts which
hand will be dominant later on.

   The little man in the brown jacket looked out of
place among the dark-suited German dignitaries today at the grand
midnight reception in the Reichstag building to celebrate Germany's
reunification.
   But someone in the government had remembered Lothar Nitsche and
made sure an invitation went out to him.
   As a teen-ager in 1948, Nitsche dared to tear down the Soviet
flag from the Brandenburg Gate when the Cold War was gripping
Berlin.
   ``I have a good life, effective today,'' the 60-year-old Nitsche
said in the old parliament building a few minutes after the
Germanys united at midnight. ``Our dreams have come true.''
   His story, told in the copies of old documents he carries like a
talisman, was of a youth spent in war and turmoil - and a brief
moment of fame 42 years ago.
   The Soviets had imposed their blockade on West Berlin in June
1948, and the U.S.-British airlift was keeping the city alive with
food and other supplies.
   Berliners feared the Western world would forget them, and on
Sept. 9 hundreds of thousands of demonstrators poured into the huge
square before the Brandenburg Gate to protest the Soviet
stranglehold.
   Nitsche, then just 18, said he had run through the gate when he
saw that another young German had managed to reach the top of the
structure and remove the Soviet flag but was frightened away by
Soviet gunfire before he could throw it to the ground.
   ``We were shouting Freedom! Freedom!'' he said, ``and people
said to get the flag down.''
   Nitsche and another young man - ``I never saw that man before in
my life'' - climbed the gate, reached the red flag and threw it
down, he said.
   The dramatic rebellious act was highlighted in newspaper
accounts of the day's demonstration and the Soviet gunfire used to
disperse the crowd.
   Nitsche said the Soviets tried several times to kidnap him
because of his notoriety.
   The U.S. Army took him out of Berlin for his safety and gave him
jobs for years afterward in Giessen, West Germany, where he married
and had three children.
   Despite his brush with the Soviets four decades ago, Nitsche
said he believes Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is ``the man
of the century'' for what he has done to permit the unification of
Germany and end the division of Europe.

   The search for 13-year-old Melissa Benoit
ended in a way that has traumatized this picture-book community:
The girl's body was found in the basement of her neighbor, a father
of two who had helped look for her.
   ``I'd rather know that it was just some sicko that grabbed her
off the street than someone she trusted,'' said Michelle Ponte, who
lives in nearby Plymouth. ``I have a 10-year-old daughter who
absolutely freaked out when she heard this.''
   The slaying on Main Street hit just about everyone in this town
of 8,500, where trees are hung with pink ribbons in Melissa's honor
and dozens of people - including the alleged killer - joined the
search after she disappeared Sept. 15.
   Melissa's partially clad body was found last week buried in the
basement of Henry Meinholz Jr. He has pleaded innocent to murder.
The cause of death has not been determined.
   Meinholz lives just a few doors away from the Benoits on Main
Street, right across from the police station. He is undergoing
psychiatric evaluation at a hospital.
   This town about 35 miles south of Boston is undergoing an
evaluation of its own as residents struggle to comprehend a crime
few ever thought would happen here.
   Meinholz's wife, Jane, a psychiatric nurse, said a funeral was
needed, not just for the victim, but for everyone's sense of trust.
   ``Until Melissa disappeared, I always felt like I was living on
the safest neighborhood possible in America,'' she said. ``I think
a lot people in our neighborhood felt that way.''
   Court records reveal that by Sept. 26, Mrs. Meinholz had told
FBI agents - who had already questioned her husband - where to
search, saying: ``I suggest you bring a shovel.''
   Meinholz, a bookkeeper at a lumber store, was described as
quiet. He was a deacon at First Baptist Church in Plymouth, where
his wife is an organist.
   But court affidavits reveal a long history of alleged sexual
problems that included exposing himself to female hitchhikers and
making obscene phone calls.
   Harvard psychology Professor Richard Herrnstein said residents'
basic assumptions about human behavior were shattered by the girl's
death.
   ``I think what happens in situations like that is that people
depend very much on the predictability of other people's
behavior,'' said Herrnstein. ``When someone violates those
expectations, especially in a harmful way, that's terrifying.''
   Bill Po, a 65-year-old resident, agreed. ``You never think it's
going to happen in your town,'' he said.
   Townspeople have come together to console each other. So many
attended a funeral Saturday for Melissa that the eulogy was
broadcast to the crowd outside.
   The curious converged on Main Street near Meinholz' house,
especially after police started looking for more bodies on his
property. Police stopped digging in his back yard Friday and said
they found no evidence of other crimes.
   More than 200 people - many of them mothers with children -
gathered at the Kingston Elementary School on Tuesday night to talk
with mental health officials and police.
   Ultimately, Herrnstein said, time is the only healer.
   ``Again, people will gradually realize that, yes, indeed, people
are predictable,'' he said, ``and that will take care of it.''

<HEAD>Baker Finds Sentiment for Military Action Against Iraq Growing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says there
is growing sentiment among nations to force Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait and the Bush administration is weighing such a military move
through the United Nations.
   After a week of talking to other world leaders at the United
Nations, Baker said Tuesday night: ``There is more of a willingness
to consider some sort of an approach like that, if it became
necessary at an appropriate time, than we had anticipated there
might be at this stage of the conflict.''
   But he stressed that sentiments could change quickly, even in
one day. And he emphasized the administration prefers a diplomatic
and political solution to Iraq's annexation of Kuwait and seizure
of the Persian Gulf emirate's oil fields.
   Baker spoke at the conclusion of a two-day meeting of 35 foreign
ministers to prepare for a European Security Conference summit in
Paris on Nov. 19-21.
   Asked if the United States had begun to draft a resolution in
which the U.N. Security Council would authorize military force
against Iraq, as reported Sunday by The Associated Press and
Newsweek magazine, Baker replied: ``There has been no decision
taken at the top levels of this government with respect to going
forward now with respect to a particular resolution.''
   However, he said, ``It would not be prudent of us not to be
giving some thought to what the various options are and how they
would be implemented.''
   U.S. officials told the AP on Sunday the ``back of the
envelope'' drafting had begun by the United States, the Soviet
Union and other governments.
   The foreign ministers adopted a resolution condemning Iraq for
its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. The statement, proposed by the
United States, called for an immediate and unconditional
withdrawal.
   The 12-nation European Community, meanwhile, approved nearly $2
billion in assistance to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey to compensate for
economic hardships arising from the Persian Gulf conflict.
   Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis said the community
would provide $660 million and member nations would provide $1.32
billion.
   The European Security Conference ministers took several steps to
strengthen the organization in preparation for the November summit
in Paris. Among them were the establishment of a small permanent
secretariat, a group to monitor elections in Europe and a center
designed to prevent conflicts between countries.
   But Baker stressed there would be no summit unless a treaty to
reduce U.S. and Soviet tanks and other non-nuclear forces in Europe
is ready to be signed.
   He said the United States and the Soviet Union had made ``good
progress'' but noted they had not settled on aircraft ceilings and
definitions of the zones in which provisions of the agreement will
apply. In addition, the two sides must settle verification
procedures.
   He and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze were
meeting today to try to wrap up the accord.
   With the Persian Gulf crisis dominating events, including the
U.N. General Assembly meeting, Baker said there was too much
``looking too hard for signals'' on how the administration was
leaning on a particular day.
   ``One day I read we are heading for war and the next day I read
we are headed rapidly toward a peaceful diplomatic solution,'' he
said.
   ``The truth of the matter is, as the president has made very
clear, and others have, the strong preference of the United States
would be to find a way to resolve this matter peacefully,
politically and diplomatically, and we will continue to work toward
that end,'' Baker said.
   ``At the same time, we cannot exclude the other option, and we
have not excluded it,'' he said.
   Baker reaffirmed, meanwhile, that the United States would assist
Israel if it were attacked by Iraq.
   ``The commitment to Israel's security is unshakable,'' he said.
``If anything like that were to happen, I think there would
certainly be an appropriate response by the United States.''
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has threatened Saudi Arabia,
which the United States is defending with 170,000 troops, and
Israel if economic sanctions threaten to strangle Iraq.

<HEAD>The Potato: No Slouch in a Hungry World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Portraying lazy people as ``couch potatoes''
is a libel on a vegetable with an important role in feeding a
hungry world, say participants in a conference on the future of the
potato.
   ``The potato yields more nutritious food quicker on less land
and under harsher climates than any major crop,'' said Robert E.
Rhoades, a potato researcher stationed in the Philippines.
   ``The idea of a lazy potato is a contradiction in terms,'' he
said.
   But Rhoades told the Smithsonian Institution meeting on
``Feeding the Global Village'' that the potato has been belittled
ever since it was carried back to Europe following Christopher
Columbus' voyage.
   There's an improbable rumor, he said, that ``spud'' comes from
the acronym for the ``Society for the Prevention of an Unwholesome
Diet,'' a group that was dedicated to keeping potatoes out of
England.
   The Scots originally refused to eat potatoes because they
weren't mentioned in the Bible, he said, and through the ages the
potato has been accused of causing syphilis, rickets, tuberculosis
and lust.
   In actual fact, the spread of the potato offers a second chance
to support a population that is outracing its capacity to feed
itself, the conference was told. It is grown in 126 countries, from
the Arctic to the tropics, atop mountains and in the desert.
   The first chance was the ``Green Revolution,'' which started in
the 1960s and kept millions alive by developing high-yield strains
of rice, corn and wheat, but never fully lived up to its promise.
   China, the world's rice bowl, has replaced Poland as the second
largest potato producer, behind the Soviet Union. India is in
fourth place, the United States fifth.
   The potato's foremost champion at the conference was researcher
Richard Sawyer, founder and director general of the International
Potato Center in Lima, Peru. He said his interest was sharpened
when he subsisted on stolen seed potatoes while a prisoner of war
in Nazi Germany.
   Changes in the way potatoes are planted promise to make this
vegetable, packed with protein and vitamin C, potassium, iron and
magnesium, widely available in poor lands where it has been too
expensive.
   Potatoes are usually grown from a tuber chunk containing buds or
``eyes.'' Research at the Potato Center made it possible to grow
them from seeds from the plant's flower, Sawyer reported,
eliminating the need to import seed material at great expense.
   ``I can hold in my hand enough true potato seed to plant a
hectare (2.471 acres), whereas it takes 4,000 pounds or more of
tubers to plant the same area,'' Sawyer said.
   Meantime, he said, scientists have only begun to explore new
varieties. At the Peru center, he said, germplasm - seed material -
for about 175 varieties has been collected.
   ``I am confident we have the ability to develop varieties which
would have resistances to pests and diseases and eliminate 90
percent of the present use of chemicals on production,'' Sawyer
said. ``What we don't have in the germplasm collection we will
probably be able to produce through the new tools of
biotechnology.''
   Rhoades said farmers in the tropics can harvest potatoes within
50 days of planting, a third of the time it takes in colder
climates. Wherever temperatures drop at night, potatoes can be
grown, he said.
   Since they grow so fast, they can be planted in fields that are
used at other times of the year to raise rice or wheat, he said.

   Some messages were poignant. Others were
cryptic. Still others were practical. All had one thing in common -
a need to communicate with loved ones held hostage in Kuwait and
Iraq.
   Families of the hostages trapped by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait began recording messages on a hotline set up Tuesday by the
government-owned Voice of America radio network.
   ``These are radio postcards,'' said VOA Director Richard
Carlson.
   The families called in on a special number provided by the State
Department task force that keeps in touch with them. The task force
instructed them to keep their greetings short - no longer than 30
seconds - to avoid political views, and to refrain from using last
names so they don't tip off Iraqi authorities searching for
Americans in hiding.
   ``Hi Johnny ... we're having three grandchildren, not two -
Michelle is having twins,'' said a woman who identified herself
only as Donita of Texas. ``You're in my thoughts constantly,
constantly, constantly. I love you very much. I pray for you.''
   One, to Sergio ``from the West coast of Mississippi,'' said
``Missy will be coming home for Thanksgiving. I pray you'll be here
too. Love, Mickey.''
   Another was to Bob ``from his loving wife Sue.'' Assuring him
the family was doing well, she added, ``we're praying for your safe
return. We miss you very, very much. Come home soon.''
   Jeff, taping a message to Mike, said he had spoken to ``Mrs. W.
in New York. Notre Dame has won its first three games. We think
about you every day.''
   The 30-second greetings will be aired starting Thursday. VOA,
which since the gulf crisis began has increased its English and
Arabic-language programs to 24 hours a day, will broadcast the
messages in three five-minute segments during each hour of the
station's morning news program.
   On the first day, the messages may be aired in a 15-minute
segment during the station's morning show.
   VOA, which broadcasts news and entertainment in 43 languages
around the globe, said this was a first-of-its-kind operation.
Jamming of VOA's Arabic service, which began within hours of the
Iraqi invasion, has eased considerably in recent days. Officials
are uncertain about the reason.
   An estimated 600 to 700 Americans are believed trapped in
Kuwait, with another 300 to 350 in Iraq. Their families - mostly
women and children - were allowed to leave the two countries.
   Iraqi authorities have rounded up about 100 Americans and moved
them to industrial and military facilities as ``human shields'' to
guard against U.S. bombings.
   The rest of the Americans in Kuwait are hiding from the
house-to-house searches by Iraqi security forces. State Department
officials say many of those captured were identified by informants
who led security forces to their hideouts.
   In many cases, Iraqi troops broke down doors to get into
apartments where Americans were hiding in cramped quarters and
suffering food shortages and uncertainty about their fate.
   A special task force at the State Department has been keeping in
touch with the families in the United States, relaying information
about the hostages if they have it and providing moral support.
   The 24-hour task force also has started referring families to
support groups, such as the National Organization for Victim
Assistance.
   John Stein, Deputy Director of the non-profit group, said
families call up with practical problems such as money shortages
and wives' need to find jobs and place kids in school.
   He said an estimated 2,000 families have been affected by the
Iraqi invasion, some because their relatives were left behind and
others in which the entire family fled but members are feeling
displaced and frightened.

<HEAD>Senator Questions Bush Nominee for Burmese Post</HEAD>

   A senator is questioning the nomination of
Frederick Vreeland to be U.S. ambassador to Burma, saying Vreeland
may have obstructed an inquiry into the attempted assassination of
Pope John Paul II.
   At the request of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday deleted Vreeland's name from
a list of nominations it approved. It scheduled a special hearing
on Vreeland for Thursday.
   The nomination for the post in the Southeast Asian nation had
been the subject of a closed-door hearing on Monday.
   The Washington Times reported last week that Vreeland is a
veteran CIA operative although his State Department biography lists
28 years of strictly diplomatic assignments.
   Efforts to reach Vreeland, of New York, were unsuccessful. He
has no number listed in the Washington, D.C., or New York City
telephone directories. The CIA does not disclose information about
its past or present agents.
   D'Amato, in an interview, said he would not discuss whether the
nominee had CIA connections. But he said, ``I have received
information that suggests that Frederick Vreeland was involved in
putting out disinformation concerning the possible Bulgarian and
Soviet involvement in the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul
II.''
   Mehmet Ali Agca, a Turk, is serving a life term in Italy for the
May 18, 1981, shooting in St. Peter's Square. Agca at first said he
acted alone but later claimed he planned the attack with Soviet
help. In 1986, three Turks and three Bulgarians were acquitted of
involvement.
   The State Department says Vreeland was an embassy counselor and
political officer in Rome at the time of the assassination attempt
and the investigation.
   On Monday, D'Amato asked the committee to review Vreeland's
nomination, and schedule the second hearing.
   ``I believe that there are serious questions concerning Mr.
Vreeland that deserve more thorough examination,'' D'Amato said.
   The biography sent by the White House to the Senate on President
Bush's nominee for ambassador to the troubled nation of Burma
describes a routine foreign service career.
   It says Vreeland has been vice president of John Cabot
International College in Rome since last year and was a
contributing editor to Conde Nast Traveler magazine in 1988 and
director of the Aspen Institute in 1985-87.
   His State Department assignments from 1957 to 1985 include
economic officer in Berlin and Rabat and political officer in Bonn,
Paris and Rome as well as an assignment with the U.S. mission to
the United Nations.
   D'Amato said that if Vreeland's reported CIA background proves
to be true, it could ``exacerbate the situation'' in Burma, where
diplomats have reported recent harassment by soldiers.
   Diplomats interviewed in Bangkok last week reported incidents
involving the U.S., British and West German embassies in Rangoon.
   The State Department confirmed that Burma's military rulers
detained and interrogated four Burmese employees of the U.S.
Embassy about mission operations and personnel.
   On Sunday, 11 senators, including D'Amato, signed a letter to
Bush asking for strong economic sanctions against Burma for its
military leaders' refusal to turn over power to an elected civilian
government and its holding of political prisoners.

<TEXT>
   In this village once known as Little
Berlin because of its dividing border wall, more than 5,000 people
held a huge unification bash on what used to be a death strip
splitting the hamlet in half.
   A notable turnout since the entire village consists of about a
dozen homes and 60 people, including the eastern part formerly
under Communist control.
   Thousands of outsiders had flocked to Moedlareuth from
surrounding communities in this forest farmland and from even
farther away to celebrate the marriage of the two Germanys.
   The throng - carrying torches and tankards of beer - roared
approval as a leading Bavarian politician said there can never
again be walls dividing Germans, or border guards threatening the
lives of innocent people.
   ``These are things that must be forever banned from German
soil,'' declared Erwin Huber, chief of the Christian Social Union,
Bavarian sister party to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrats.
   Moedlareuth, which borders on Bavaria and Thuringia, was divided
from 1945 until November 1989.
   In 1952, border fortifications were installed. Communist armed
patrols, tripwire shooting devices and guard dogs were brought in
to what became known as ``death strip,'' although no one is
actually known to have been killed trying to flee across it to the
West.
   The same year the border fortifications went up the local miller
escaped out a window as Communist authorities began tearing down
his mill to keep it from being used as a hiding place for would-be
escapees.
   In 1966, a concrete wall 2,160 feet long was built. Guards in an
observation tower had shoot-to-kill-orders.
   Foot and vehicle traffic between east and west Moedlareuth was
stopped.
   Only rare visits were allowed to the western district of the
village by the Communists, and none to the eastern section.
   President Bush visited the village when he was vice president
and called it Little Berlin.
   On Tuesday night, Moedlareuth vibrated with music and joy.
   Fireworks screamed across the sky at midnight as the border that
once cut through Moedlareuth and the rest of Germany vanished
   People from the eastern section of Moedlareuth, like 62-year-old
farmer Rudolf Richter, knew well why a celebration was in order.
   He recalled, ``My cousins lived just 100 meters (330 feet) away,
an  I wasn't even allowed to wave to them from here.''
   Hundreds of revelers jammed inside a tent on the former death
strip, dancing to rock music and swigging beer.
   Many celebrants stared at the 990-foot wall section that
remains.
   Authorities want to keep it as a reminder.

<HEAD>Private Industry Not High On Space Projects, Government Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA got a cool response to its first effort
to arrange private financing for space projects, partly because it
turned out the government way was cheaper, a government study says.
   ``Private concerns were not willing to invest in most of the
projects because they perceived few or no commercial markets for
them,'' said the General Accounting Office, which reviewed the NASA
effort.
   The space agency sought private financing last year for seven
projects worth nearly $800 million, but only one wound up being
commercialized, GAO said.
   A cornerstone of the United States space policy under presidents
Bush and Ronald Reagan has been to increase private sector
investment. To that end, Bush's budget last year proposed private
financing for the projects in the space shuttle and space station
programs.
   The GAO said it reviewed NASA's actions ``because this was the
first effort of this type.''
   Not only did private industry not see a commercial market, said
GAO, about half the projects were believed too far along in
development to modify for commercial use without added expense and
delay. For some, the financial risk was judged to be too high.
   ``Private financing would have significantly increased the
government's cost for some projects,'' the study said.
   The ventures were an advanced solid rocket motor production
facility in Yellow Creek, Miss., a weightlessness laboratory at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston, a space station payload processing
facility at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, a processing
laboratory for observational instruments at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in California, a robotic arm and a docking system for
the space station, and equipment to make the shuttle able to fly
16-day missions.
   NASA rejected financing proposals for three of the four
construction jobs because they would have been significantly more
costly than if the money was provided by the government.
   Even the remaining construction proposal was more expensive, GAO
said, ``but NASA concluded that the cost difference of about 4
percent, or $16 million, was insignificant.''
   It turned out that only one project was commercialized. It
involved private financing for a pallet to carry extra oxygen and
hydrogen for long duration flights.
   Private financing of space projects was intended to help reduce
NASA spending, GAO said, but added it is an ``unlikely
possibility'' that private industry can borrow money cheaper than
government.
   Because it expected private financing, NASA removed the seven
projects from its budget requests, then had to reinstate them
because of the lack of response. GAO said NASA jumped the gun and
failed to evaluate the proposals properly.
   GAO addressed the report to NASA administrator Richard Truly,
along with recommendations that the space agency work on screening
criteria for commercialization candidates and that it keep such
projects in the budget until financing is found.
   The decision to seek private financing was made jointly by NASA
and the president's Office of Management and Budget and the space
agency responded that it is ``not entirely a free agent'' in the
budget decision process.
   OMB associate director Robert E. Grady said the study overstated
the conclusion that private industry saw no money to be made in the
projects.
   ``NASA received many expressions of interest in the two space
station facilities and received specific proposals on five of the
seven projects,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, in most cases, the
proposals were not economically viable because of the unwillingness
of the private sector to accept an appropriate level of risk.''

<HEAD>`Bureaucrat Bob' vs. `Junior Mosbacher'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT ROTHSCHILD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rob Mosbacher is the son of U.S. Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher, but he is depicting himself as an
outsider to Texas politics in a bid to become the state's
lieutenant governor.
   Democrat Bob Bullock calls the 39-year-old Mosbacher ``Junior''
and says he is a ``Republican Party groupie.'' Mosbacher refers to
his opponent as ``Bureaucrat Bob.'' Bullock has been the state's
comptroller for the past 15 years.
   Gubernatorial candidates Ann Richards and Clayton Williams have
grabbed most of the attention in this election year, but the title
of lieutenant governor carries real power with it in the Lone Star
state.
   The lieutenant governor controls the flow of legislation in the
Senate and appoints committee chairmen. Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby has
held the post since 1972, but decided not to seek re-election.
   His criticisms of Bullock notwithstanding, Mosbacher has
bureaucratic problems of his own.
   He was appointed chairman of the Texas Department of Human
Services in 1987 and the agency's financial difficulties hang like
an albatross around his neck. State lawmakers have twice bailed out
the department with emergency appropriations.
   Some legislators predict a tax bill will be necessary next year,
due largely to problems at Mosbacher's agency. The department,
which provides assistance to more than 600,000 Texans, has
requested an additional $2.5 billion.
   Running on his record, Bullock, 61, says he has transformed a
sleepy agency into a modern, efficient revenue-collecting office.
   Mosbacher alleges there has been extravagant spending in the
comptroller's office.
   ``If there's anything that's missing, particularly in every
agency that I know of in state government, it's a matter of
effectively establishing accountability for what you're spending,''
said Mosbacher.
   Mosbacher says Bullock's long tenure in government has put him
out of touch and made him ``part of our problem.''
   Bullock defends the expenditures, welcomes comparing the
efficiency of DHS and the comptroller's office, and has released
his own list of questionable purchases by Mosbacher's agency.
   Bullock says Mosbacher's claim to be an outsider in Austin is
phony. Mosbacher, whose father was the chief fund-raiser for
President Bush before he became Commerce secretary, also ran in the
1984 GOP Senate primary against Phil Gramm.
   Bullock says Mosbacher has botched the only responsibility he's
been given and is spending his inheritance trying to buy an elected
office.
   ``He's in over his head. If he had started out and worked
himself up in government and learned what was actually happening,
it would be different,'' Bullock said.
   Mosbacher blames his department's problems on a lack of
legislative financing and unexpected costs due to expansion of
coverage mandated by Congress. He says that as lieutenant governor
he will bring new ideas and a businessman's approach to state
government.
   Bullock touts his experience in collecting taxes and the budget
process, saying his expertise is needed to grapple with budget
problems on the horizon.
   Mosbacher has linked himself to Republican gubernatorial nominee
Williams, who holds an edge over Democrat Richards in voter
surveys.
   ``If you're going to elect Clayton Williams as governor, and you
want him to go to Austin to shake things up, don't send him
alone,'' Mosbacher says.

   Here is the text of President Bush's address
to the American people Tuesday night:
   Tonight, I want to talk to you about a problem that has lingered
and dogged and vexed this country for far too long: the federal
budget deficit. Thomas Paine said many years ago, ``These are the
times that try men's souls.'' As we speak, our nation is standing
together against Saddam Hussein's aggression. But here at home,
there is another threat, a cancer gnawing away at our nation's
health. That cancer is the budget deficit. Year after year, it
mortgages the future of our children.
   No family, no nation, can continue to do business the way the
federal government has been operating and survive. When you get a
bill, that bill must be paid and when you write a check, you're
supposed to have money in the bank. But if you don't obey these
simple rules of common sense, there's a price to pay. But for too
long, the nation's business in Washington has been conducted as if
these basic rules did not apply. Well these rules do apply. And if
we fail to act, next year alone, we will face a federal budget
deficit of more than $300 billion. A deficit that could weaken our
economy further and cost us thousands of precious jobs.
   If what goes up must come down, then the way down could be very
hard. But it doesn't have to be that way. We can do something. In
fact, we have started to do something. But we must act this week,
when Congress will hold the first of two crucial up-or-down votes.
These votes will be on a deficit reduction agreement, worked out
between the administration and the bipartisan leaders of Congress.
This budget agreement is the result of eight months of blood, sweat
and fears. Fears of the economic chaos that would follow if we fail
to reduce the deficit.
   Of course, I cannot claim it's the best deficit reduction plan
possible. It's not. Any one of us alone might have written a better
plan. But it is the best agreement that can be legislated now. It
is the biggest deficit reduction agreement ever - half a trillion
dollars. It's the toughest deficit reduction package ever, with new
enforcement rules to make sure that what we fix now stays fixed.
And it has the largest spending savings ever - more than $300
billion. For the first time, a Republican president and leaders of
the Democratic Congress have agreed to real cuts that will be
enforced by law, not promises. No smoke, no mirrors, no magic act,
but real and lasting spending cuts.

   This agreement will also raise revenue. I'm not - and I know
you're not - a fan of tax increases. But if there have to be tax
measures, they should allow the economy to grow, they should not
turn us back to higher income tax rates andthey should be fair.
Everyone who can should contribute something and no one should have
to contribute beyond their fair share. Our bipartisan agreement
meets these tests. And through specific new incentives it will help
create more jobs.
   It's a little known fact. But America's best job creators and
greatest innovators tend to be our smaller companies. So our budget
plan will small-and medium-size companies a needed shot in the arm.
Just as important, I am convinced that this agreement will help
lower interest rates and lower interest rates means savings for
consumers, lower mortgage payments for new homeowners, and more
investment to produce more jobs. And that's what this agreement
will do.
   And now let me tell you what this agreement will not do. It will
not raise income tax rates, personal or corporate. It will not mess
with Social Security in any way. It will not put America's national
security at risk. And most of all, it will not let our economy slip
out of control.
   Clearly each and every one of us can find fault with something
in this agreement. In fact, that is a burden that any truly fair
solution must carry. Any workable solution must be judged as a
whole, not piece by piece. Those who dislike one part or another
may pick our agreement apart. But if they do, believe me, the
political reality is, no one can put a better one back together
again.
   Everyone will bear a small burden. But if we succeed, every
American will have a large burden lifted. If we fail to enact this
agreement, our economy will falter, markets may tumble and
recession will follow. In just a moment the Democratic majority
leader, Senator Mitchell, will offer what is known as the
Democratic response - often a rebuttal, but not tonight.
   Tonight, the Democratic and Republican leadership and I all
speak with one voice in support of this agreement. Tonight, we ask
you to help us move this agreement forward. The congressional
leadership and I both have a job to do in getting it enacted, and
tonight I ask for your help.
   First, I ask you to understand how important, and, for some, how
difficult this vote is, for your congressmen and senators. Many
worry about your reaction to one part or another. But I know you
know the importance of the whole. And so second, I ask you to take
this initiative: Tell your congressmen and senators you support
this deficit reduction agreement.
   If they are Republicans, urge them to stand with the president.
Urge them to do what the bipartisan leadership has done, come
together in the spirit of compromise to solve this national
problem. If they're Democrats, urge them to stand with their
congressional leaders. Ask them to fight for the future of your
kids by supporting this budget agreement. Now is the time for you,
the American people, to have a real impact.
   Your senators and congressmen need to know that you want this
deficit brought down. That the time for politics and posturing is
over and the time to come together is now. This deficit reduction
agreement is tough and so are the times. The agreement is fair, and
so is the American spirit. The agreement is bipartisan, and so is
the vote. The agreement is real, and so is this crisis.
   This is the first time in my presidency that I have made an
appeal like this to you, the American people. With your help we can
at last put this budget crisis behind us and face the other
challenges that lie ahead. If we do, the long-term result will be a
healthier nation and something more. We will have once again put
ourselves on the path of economic growth and we will have
demonstrated that no challenge is greater than the determination of
the American people.
   Thank you, God bless you and good night.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Bush's televised address to the nation Tuesday night,
delivered by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I speak tonight not for the Democratic Party but for America's
future.
   For more than a decade the United States has endured budget
deficits that sap our economic strength. When you have a deficit
there are only two things you can do; cut spending or increase
revenue. This agreement does both.
   It cuts spending, military and domestic. It raises taxes.
   The President has asked you to support the budget agreement. The
democratic leadership in Congress joins in that appeal. We
recognize that this budget demands sacrifice from all Americans.
   But if enacted, it holds the promise of restoring a sound
economy from which all Americans will benefit.
   The agreement is a compromise. It's not what the President,
working alone, would have preferred. It's not what we Democrats,
working on our own, would have produced. Neither side got all it
wanted.
   And many are asking, ``Why did it take so long?'' The answer is
simple. What delayed us for months is what has divided us for
years. Democrats and Republicans have deep differences over values
and priorities.
   We prefer a budget that asks more from the wealthy and less from
the elderly. But when the President asked us to join in rewriting
his budget we agreed, because the nation is more important than
partisan differences.
   When the President asked us to help work out a compromise he got
our help. Now we hope that members of his party, the Republican
members of Congress, will also set aside partisan differences, as
we have done, and join us in doing what's right for our country.
   Two centuries ago the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia
was drawing to a close. The delegates had quarreled for months. Now
they were to vote on a difficult compromise. Benjamin Franklin, 81
years old rose slowly and said to his fellow delegates, ``I
confess that there are several parts of this Constitution which I
do not approve. But I doubt whether any other convention may be
able to make a better constitution, for when you assemble men to
have the advantage of their joint wisdom you inevitably assemble
all their prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion,
their local interests, their selfish views. From such an assembly,
can a perfect production be expected? I consent to this
Constitution because I expect no better and because I am not sure
it is not the best.''
   Of course, no budget can be compared with the Constitution, but
Franklin's point applies. Every human work is imperfect and that's
certainly true of this budget.
   But it's also true that for America's economic future, we have
to pass it. With your help, we will.
   Thank you and good night.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trustees at the University of the District of
Columbia and striking students are deadlocked over a demand that 11
of the 15 trustees resign before the week-old shutdown of the
school can be resolved.
   But trustee A. Knighton Stanley, one of the 11 board members
appointed by Mayor Marion Barry that students want replaced, said
Tuesday that if the panel was essentially replaced en masse as the
students want, it could affect the university's accreditation.
   ``We have negotiated back and forth on that issue. We have
stalemated and we have made our final offer,'' he said. ``The ball
is back in the students' court. The challenge is theirs.''
   Another negotiating session was scheduled today.
   Stanley submitted his resignation, effective next March 31, on
Tuesday. Four other board members also have stepped down or
announced plans to do so.
   Student spokesman Mark Thompson said the protest will continue
at the 12,000-student university until the board is replaced.
   ``We need a victory so that never again anyone will be able to
say anything negative about the students from UDC,'' Thompson said.
   He also said the occupation of the administration building will
continue even though some students want to return to classes, which
have been disrupted since the beginning of the boycott on Sept. 26.
   The students have demanded extensive changes in the way the
university is run and improvements in several athletic and academic
programs. They say the board has allowed the quality of the school
to decline and put the accreditations of some of its departments in
jeopardy.
   Feminist artist Judy Chicago also withdrew her donation of a
sculpture that had been the target of student protests. She said
``The Dinner Party'' was being withdrawn ``in support of the
students right to determine their own destiny.''
   Students were upset about a trustee plan to spend $1.6 million
for renovations to a library so Chicago's work could be installed
there. The House of Representatives withdrew the same amount from
the school's appropriations package in protest of UDC's intentions.

   Jovial West German boys spent the night firing
their flare guns at a little East German car suspended by a giant
crane.
   A woman leaned on a railing over the Spree River, dressed in a
smartly tailored Soviet major's uniform. She said she wanted to
feel like an occupying power.
   A man wearing a black ski mask sat in a lawn chair in the heart
of the celebrations over German unity, passing out leaflets
explaining why it should not take place.
   Too late. Germany became one nation today, but it was clear that
its inhabitants are still two people.
   For West Germans, the celebration was pure, a victory.
   But for East Germans, it was tinged with angst. Many are now out
of work - or will be soon - and must find a way to fit into a
foreign society.
   An estimated 1 million people gathered for the moment, at
midnight, and a nearly full moon, a brace of searchlights and a
seemingly endless supply of fireworks lighted up the clear night
sky.
   It was the most festive, and the most orchestrated, of the mass
street celebrations that have marked East Germany's transition from
a communist country to a free nation to part of a new Germany.
   A giant German flag was raised over the Reichstag, the old
parliament building near where the Berlin Wall once divided the
city.
   Masses of people surrounded the building in the chilly, clear
night and packed the nearby plaza of the gigantic Brandenburg Gate.
Many joined in an emotional chorus of the national anthem.
   Harmut Giese watched the scene from nearby Potsdamer Platz, the
once-bustling main square of old Berlin reduced to a muddy field by
the Berlin Wall.
   ``This was overdone, all of this money,'' said the 46-year-old
East German, a teacher at a machinists trade school.
   ``But we need things like this to help bring us together, to
give us something to share,'' he said. ``Even children in
kindergarten here think in terms of communism, closed borders.
Everything is still new.''
   Giese said his 19-year-old daughter was a dissident during the
old days and was relentlessly harassed by the Communist secret
police. He said she now lives in West Germany.
   ``It was hard for us,'' he said.
   Standing not too far away, with his wife and two children, was
Wolf Glaeser, an employee for the East German airline Interflug. He
said he's losing his job by year's end.
   ``I came for the fireworks,'' he said. ``Unity is so-so. There
are just too many economic problems for me.''
   East Berlin's main avenue, the broad Unter den Linden, was a
surging tide of shoulder-to-shoulder celebrants who flowed from one
side of downtown to the other.
   Swing, rock and jazz bands lined the promenade, restaurants
pushed bratwurst and beer, peddlers hawked unity T-shirts and
well-dressed people wore balloons on their heads.
   Heide Thielbeer of Hamburg stopped pedestrian traffic and drew
gawks.
   Miss Theilbeer tested East Germans' inherent animosity for their
Soviet occupiers by wearing a Soviet major's jacket and hat, and
black tights.
   ``I wanted to see what it would be like to be an occupying power
in East Germany, expecially now that the Soviets have to go away,''
she said.
   She would not give her age. ``But I was born during Stalingrad,
darling,'' she said, referring to the 1942-43 battle during which
the Soviets defeated the Nazi army. The battle is considered a
turning point in the war.
   Leftist radicals held scattered protests in both sides of
Berlin.
   About 200 brought shrill whistles to the Schauspielhaus, the
opera house in East Berlin where a ritzy pre-unity party was thrown
for top German politicians.
   They jeered at the arriving guests, blew their whistles and
chanted ``Germany, drop dead!''
   The surreal scene near Brandenburg, as bright as daylight under
the glare of floodlights, inexplicably included a giant crane
holding aloft a tiny Trabant, the two-cylinder auto that stopped
rolling off assembly lines as soon as East Germans were able to buy
Western cars.
   West German youths with flare guns spent their time firing at
it, and frequently hitting it. The obsolete East German flag
hanging below it was tattered by night's end.
   A 24-year-old East Berliner who refused to give his name sat in
a lawn chair in front of Brandenburg Gate, surrounded by thousands
of jubilant pro-unity celebrants.
   He passed out pamphlets while wearing a black ski mask. Unity
was too costly and unfair to Germans in both sides, it said.
   ``People here have been giving me trouble,'' he said.

<HEAD>Souter to Take Seat on Supreme Court Next Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Souter of New Hampshire will take his
oath next week as a Supreme Court justice with the nation watching
how he'll vote on abortion and other contentious social issues.
   The Senate voted 90-9 Tuesday to confirm Souter, 51, as the
105th member of the high court in the nation's history.
   The court immediately announced that Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist will swear in Souter next Tuesday morning, just before
the Supreme Court begins hearing the second week of arguments in
its 1990-91 term.
   The first major case Souter will hear concerns a sex-bias
dispute. At issue is whether employers may exclude all women of
childbearing age from some hazardous jobs, and the court's decision
could affect millions of women.
   Issues of sex discrimination, race discrimination and especially
abortion rights were at the core of opposition to Souter within and
outside the Senate.
   The handful who voted against him and many voting for the
nomination worried aloud that he would side with the court's
conservatives and overrule Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling that
legalized abortion.
   To many Democrats who voted for Souter, his record on these
social issues was troubling but his testimony encouraging, even
though he refused to be pinned down, especially on the politically
hot abortion decision.
   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., a member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said there appeared to be ``two Judge Souters.''
   ``The Judge Souter who testified before our committee did not
seem locked to the past,'' and that was the one he was voting for,
Kohl said. He added that he hoped the Senate had not been deceived.
   ``He's about the best we can expect, from my perspective, from
this administration,'' Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden,
D-Del., said of President Bush's first Supreme Court nominee.
   But the National Abortion Rights Action League said the Senate
``made a dangerous leap of faith'' that could lead to the defeat of
abortion rights and a return to ``back-alley abortions.''
   Souter toasted the vote with champagne in Concord, N.H., and
pledged to return the nation's confidence in him.
   ``I have been given much and much will be expected of me in
return, and I will make that return to you and I will make it in
the fullest measure that I can,'' he said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and other Democrats who opposed
the nomination, said they would not give Souter the benefit of the
doubt.
   Souter could ``solidify a 5-4 anti-civil rights, anti-privacy
majority'' on the court, said Kennedy, repeating the argument he
made as the only member of the Senate Judiciary Committee to oppose
the nomination.
   In addition to Kennedy, those voting against Souter, all
Democrats, were Alan Cranston of California, Daniel Akaka of
Hawaii, Brock Adams of Washington, Bill Bradley and Frank
Lautenberg of New Jersey, Quentin Burdick of North Dakota, John
Kerry of Massachusetts and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. Sen. Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., did not vote.
   Biden warned Bush that the next nominee might not get confirmed
if the president moved further to the right.
   ``I want to express the hope that the administration will not
learn the wrong lesson'' from the lopsided Senate vote on Souter,
Biden said. A more doctrinaire conservative ``could well fall
outside the sphere of acceptability,'' he said.
   Souter, who lives in rural Weare, N.H., near Concord, is a
graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School and a Rhodes
Scholar.
   After law school, Souter returned home to practice and soon
began working in the judicial system of his home state, working his
way up to attorney general, trial judge and then the state Supreme
Court.
   Last April, he was confirmed by the Senate to the 1st U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.
   Souter will fill the seat vacated by the retirement of Justice
William Brennan in July. He almost certainly will vote more
conservatively than the liberal Brennan, and conservatives were
pleased.
   ``He's just exactly the kind of person with a broad background
that we need on the Supreme Court,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
``I think he showed that he is a person of fairness. He's willing
to listen. He's a person of independence.''

<HEAD>Aspirin May Prevent Migraines, Researchers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aspirin every other day may help prevent
migraines among some of the millions of Americans who suffer theexcruciating
headaches, scientists reported today.
   The findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association
are from the same study that found aspirin effective in preventing
a first heart attack.
   The researchers found that a group of men who took one aspirin
every other day reported 20 percent fewer migraines than a similar
group that took a dummy tablet.
   Headache experts called the research results encouraging. But
they said aspirin could offer, at best, only a partial solution to
the migraine puzzle.
   Nevertheless, ``there's enough evidence here that health-care
practitioners should consider aspirin for migraine treatment,''
said Julie E. Buring, leader of the team at Boston's Brigham and
Women's Hospital that reported the findings.
   An estimated 20 percent of American adults suffer migraines.
Headache experts say there is no known single cause of migraines.
The severe headaches, often accompanied by nausea, appear to be
triggered in some patients by certain foods and also seem related
to stress and a lack of regular sleep, meals and exercise.
   Buring and her colleagues analyzed five years of data from the
Physicians Health Study, a project involving about 22,000 U.S. male
physicians that began in 1982.
   The project is devoted to studying the effects of aspirin and
beta carotene, an orange pigment found in certain fruits and
vegetables, on heart disease, migraine and cancer.
   Of the approximately 11,000 doctors who took aspirin, 661
reported migraines at some time after the study began compared with
818 of those who took the aspirin placebo.
   The researchers did not analyze the data regarding beta carotene
and migraine, Buring said in a telephone interview.
   She said the aspirin portion of the study ended in 1988 when the
researchers felt compelled to report a finding that those on the
aspirin regimen had a 44 percent lower risk of developing a first
heart attack.
   Aspirin may help prevent migraines for the same reason it helps
prevent heart attacks, Buring said: In low doses it hinders the
formation of clumps of blood platelets, which cause blood clots.
The effect disappears at higher doses.
   When platelets unite, they send into the bloodstream a substance
called serotonin that is also released shortly before a migraine
attack in most sufferers, Buring said.
   By hindering the release of serotonin, aspirin may prevent the
chain of events that culminate in a migraine, said Buring, herself
a migraine sufferer.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. D.J. Dalessio of Scripps
Clinic and Research Foundation of La Jolla, Calif., suggested
doctors incorporate aspirin into their treatment of men who suffer
migraine attacks at least weekly.
   Doctors have had some success treating migraines with
medications including anti-inflammatory and antidepressant drugs,
said Dr. Robert S. Kunkel, head of the headache section at the
Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Cleveland.
   But aspirin would be preferable, said Dr. Alexander Mauskop, who
runs a headache clinic at the State University of New York Health
Science Center in Brooklyn.
   ``It certainly would be cheaper because aspirin costs about a
penny a pill,'' he said. ``And it would have the additional benefit
of preventing strokes and heart attacks.''

<HEAD>Governor Protests Brown's Budget Stand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder accused Democratic
National Chairman Ron H. Brown of breaking a promise to oppose tax
increases that would hurt the middle class.
   In a letter to the party chairman, Wilder, a Democrat, said
Brown had promised Democrats would fight for tax cuts for
middle-class Americans who were hurt most by Republican-backed tax
increases in the 1980s.
   ``You have now repudiated your previous positions and have
joined in support of the tax increases you previously said would be
unfair to the very people we need to protect,'' Wilder wrote
Tuesday.
   Brown said he would support the budget compromise drafted by
congressional leaders and the Bush administration because it is
preferable to automatic spending cuts that would go into effect
without the tax increases. The compromise calls for increasing
taxes on gasoline, liquor and luxury items and reducing Medicare
benefits.
   Laura F. Dillard, Wilder's press secretary, said the governor
thinks federal budget negotiators should have looked harder for
spending cuts before raising taxes.

<HEAD>Democrats Press President Ford To Repudiate Conservative Word List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group devoted to re-electing Democratic
congressmen wants former President Ford to repudiate a conservative
word list designed to give Republicans verbal ammunition in
political campaigns.
   The list, drafted by the Republican political action committee
GOPAC, included such words as ``greed,'' ``traitors'' and
``liberal'' to use against Democratic opponents. Words such as
``family,'' ``children'' and ``vision,'' were suggested as
appropriate for GOP candidates to use when referring to themselves.
   Ford serves as honorary chairman of GOPAC.
   In a letter to Ford, the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee decried the word list as ``demagoguery without limits,
without content and without honesty.'' DCCC Chairman Beryl Anthony
Jr., an Arkansas congressman, said in the letter that Ford should
dissociate himself from such tactics.
   ``As an individual who has devoted his life to public service
and the honorable debate of issues, I am sure you will find these
activities as disgusting as I do,'' Anthony wrote. ``I also hope
you will demonstrate your support for decency in our nation's
political life by publicly repudiating this group and its
tactics.''
   Anthony did not accuse Ford of involvement in producing the
GOPAC word list. In fact, a copy of the list was included in the
letter to Ford, ``in the event that you have not seen it.''
   Ford spokeswoman Penny Circle said the letter arrived at Ford's
Rancho Mirage, Calif., office on Monday and that Ford had not had
an opportunity to read it. Democrats directed their ire at Rep.
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who is GOPAC's general chairman.

<TEXT>
   The much-heralded season premiere of ABC's
``Twin Peaks'' bottomed out in 41st place in the ratings.
   ``The Civil War,'' meanwhile, was the most-watched series in PBS
history and was seen by an estimated 14 million people each night.
   In the Sunday night time slot, the two-hour ``Twin Peaks''
finished behind NBC's ``Perry Mason'' movie and CBS' movie ``The
Face of Fear.'' The Fox comedy ``Married ... With Children'' beat
``Twin Peaks'' for the night, too.
   Led by a No. 1 finish for the second consecutive week by
``Cheers,'' NBC won the week with a 12.9 average rating, the A.C.
Nielsen Co. reported Tuesday.
   CBS, which won the opening week of the fall season for the first
time in six years, was second with a 12.3. ABC had a 12.0. Each
ratings point represents 931,000 homes.
   The combined network share of the TV audience during the fall
season's second week was down to 63 percent from 68 percent the
previous week. NBC attributed the decline to ``The Civil War.''
   PBS said its acclaimed 11-hour documentary had a 9 rating in the
nation's 24 largest TV markets.
   Reruns of Fox's ``The Simpsons'' continued to struggle in
head-to-head competition against new episodes of NBC's ``The Cosby
Show.'' ``Cosby'' finished in third, while Bart and his family
dropped to 73rd. New episodes of ``The Simpsons'' arrive Oct. 11.
   ABC won the network news ratings for the 38th consecutive week,
with an average of 10.0. CBS had an 8.6 and NBC an 8.5.
   Here are the Top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``Cheers,''
NBC, 19.7; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 19.6; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC,
18.4; ``Murphy Brown,'' CBS, 18.2; ``Designing Women,'' CBS, ``The
Golden Girls,'' NBC (tie) 18.1; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 17.6; ``Empty
Net,'' NBC, 17.4; ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC, 17.2;

   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, is urging Americans to support a $500 billion deficit
reduction package because ``the nation is more important than
partisan differences.''
   Mitchell, in a televised speech Tuesday night that followed a
similar appearance by President Bush, said the proposal ``holds the
promise of restoring a sound economy.''
   Just moments before Mitchell spoke, the president called the
package negotiated by his administration and congressional leaders
``the best agreement that can be legislated now.''
   Mitchell reminded viewers that the two parties still have ``deep
differences over values and priorities'' that delayed an agreement
for months.
   ``We prefer a budget that asks more from the wealthy and less
from the elderly,'' he said.
   His remark referred to the Democrats' preference for higher
taxes on wealthy Americans as the price for a Bush proposal to
reduce the capital gains tax. These differences produced a
stalemate and both ites were dropped from the budget agreement.
   Mitchell's comment on the party divisions drew an immediate
reaction from Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., chairman of the House
Republican Conference. In a statement after Bush and Mitchell
spoke, Lewis said, ``George Mitchell's partisan shots at capital
gains in his response was most disturbing.
   ``He, more than anyone else, is responsible for the death of
capital gains in the budget package.''
   But Lewis only had praise for the president, commenting that
Bush ``stepped up to the plate tonight and hit the ball clear out
of the park. His appeal to the American people will make the
difference.''
   He called the upcoming votes on the package the ``most important
... of the Bush presidency thus far'' and predicted a last-minute
``surge of support'' will win passage of the compromise.
   While conservative House Republicans have led the way in
opposing the compromise, a liberal Democrat said he also would
fight the package.
   The proposal would raise taxes on gasoline, alcohol, cigarettes,
boats and furs while trimming benefits to farmers and Medicare
recipients. It also would raise taxes for people who earn more than
$100,000.
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said the plan places too heavy a burden
on the backs of low- and middle-income taxpayers. Defense cuts
would be too small and upper-income Americans would not be taxed
enough, he said.
   ``It is a plan without compassion,'' Lewis said. ``It is not
right; it is not just; it is not fair.''
   Lewis said the proposal ``abandons the constituencies the
Democrats have long represented. Democrats cannot afford to turn
their backs on working people. We cannot turn our backs on the
elderly.''
   Mitchell, speaking on behalf of his party, said that when Bush
asked Democrats to join in rewriting the White House budget plan,
``we agreed, because the nation is more important than partisan
differences.''
   Mitchell called the package ``imperfect,'' and said ``neither
side got what it wanted.''
   And he added, ``We recognize that this budget demands sacrifice
from all Americans.''

<HEAD>Baker Approves Loan Guarantees For Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has
reached an agreement with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy that
will provide Israel with a $400 million loan guarantee for housing.
   Baker said late Tuesday that key provisions include Israeli
assurances that Soviet Jews would not be settled in
Israeli-occupied areas held by the Arabs before the 1967 Middle
East war.
   Presumably that includes the portion of Jerusalem that Jordan
held as well as the West Bank, also held by Jordan, and Gaza, held
by Egypt.
   Baker said at a news conference that Israel also would affirm
that it is not providing incentives for Soviet immigrants to settle
in those areas.
   Congress approved the loan guarantee three months ago. However,
the Bush administration insisted on assurances from Jerusalem that
Jewish settlements would not be furthered as a result.
   Less than 2 percent of the record influx of Soviet Jews wind up
on the West Bank or in Gaza, according to the Israeli government.
   The Bush administration wants Israel to withdraw from most, if
not all, of the land in exchange for Arab recognition as part of an
overall Middle East agreement.
   Baker said ``we have a major difference of opinion'' with Israel
on settlements.
   Israel will obtain the $400 million from commercial banks, most
of them American, with the U.S. government guaranteeing the loans.

<TEXT>
   A car driven by a 91-year-old man thought
to have had a heart attack careened down a street at up to 80 mph,
killing the motorist and three other people in a fiery pileup,
police said.
   Among those killed Tuesday were two children trapped in a
burning car, authorities said. One person was critically injured.
   Police said the elderly man, who had a history of heart trouble,
apparently was stricken at the wheel and jammed the accelerator to
the floor.
   Witnesses said the Cadillac lurched forward at the top of steep
Noe Valley Street near the city's Castro District and sailed
through six intersections. It smashed into seven cars and knocked
over utility poles before flipping over.
   Vanessa Santarsiero, manager of a boutique, said she saw the
accident through the store window.
   ``The guy in the maroon car ... just sailed down the hill really
fast,'' she said. ``When he hit a hump in the intersection, then he
kind of flew across it, clearing the ground. There was a crash, a
screech, and a million things flying.''
   The elderly driver was killed, along with the two children and
one other person, authorities said. A woman was listed in critical
condition at San Francisco General Hospital with burns on the legs
and arms.
   The victims' identities were not immediately released.
   Police Inspector James Smith said the driver had a history of
heart problems and was scheduled to see his doctor. ``We assume he
experienced some sort of medical emergency while he was driving,''
he said.
   Mark Conrad, a store clerk, said he ran out to help upon hearing
the screech of the cars and an explosion. Through the smoke, he
said, he saw a girl trapped in an overturned car.
   He said he could hear her cries for help as people tried to
reach in to pull her out. ``They were reaching in and their hands
got burned, so they had to pull back,'' he said. As they backed
off, the car burst into flames.
   The scene was littered with wreckage in all directions in the
afternoon accident. The area is heavily populated with apartment
buildings, shops and dozens of restaurants.

<HEAD>Eighteen Arrested For Protesting Lack of Benefits For Women AIDS
Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen demonstrators were arrested after
blocking traffic on a busy street to protest rules they say
unfairly deny disability benefits to many women infected with the
AIDS virus.
   The AIDS activists said Tuesday the Social Security
Administration, in determining eligibility for disability benefits,
is ignoring many of the diseases and infections that are common in
women infected with the virus.
   The result is that many women with disabling conditions
including gynecological disorders like pelvic inflammatory disease
and chronic vaginal infections are denied benefits, the protesters
said.
   These disorders are not on a list of infections and diseases
used by the Centers for Disease Control to define AIDS. Much of the
list was compiled in the early days of the epidemic when most AIDS
victims were white, middle-class, homosexual men.
   But this definition misses the ailments and conditions common to
women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which
causes AIDS, the activists said.
   Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King said officials
awarding disability benefits are not limited by the CDC definition
of AIDS.
   Officials can award up to three months of Supplemental Security
Income payments immediately upon request to people who have any of
the AIDS-related conditions on CDC's list, pending a final decision
on the claim, she said.
   But Social Security officials also ``can and do'' give this
three-month presumptive disability status to people who are sick
with HIV infection but have not progressed into AIDS, she said in a
statement.

<HEAD>EPA Fails To Assure Disinfectants Kill Germs As Claimed, Study</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency fails to
monitor the effectiveness of disinfectants and up to 20 percent of
the products sold to kill disease-causing germs may not work,
according to a government study.
   In a report released to Congress on Tuesday, the General
Accounting Office said the EPA has not inspected the majority of
laboratories that test disinfectants and that the agency ``lacks
assurance'' methods to prove the germ-killers are valid.
   The GAO report said estimates by the EPA's own experts are that
an estimated 20 percent of all disinfectants fail to kill germs or
viruses as they are supposed to, and that tests in some states show
that more than 40 percent of the compounds are ineffective.
   The EPA is directed by law to register disinfectants and to
assure that they are effective. But the GAO said the agency depends
on test data submitted by manufacturers and that the EPA ``lacks
assurance that the test methods and performance standards used...
are valid.''
   Anne Lindsay, the EPA official who supervises the disinfectant
registration, said her agency has monitored labs that do about 40
percent of the testing. She also said the agency is developing a
``re-enforcement strategy'' to assure that manufacturers accurately
report test data.

   The Bush administration is taking new steps to
strengthen relations with Chile's new democratic government by
allowing the Overseas Private Investment Corp. to resume operations
there.
   The announcement came Tuesday during the first Washington visit
of President Patricio Aylwin since his March inauguration brought
democratic rule back to Chile. Aylwin met President Bush at the
White House.
   OPIC is a quasi-governmental organization that facilitates
investment by U.S. companies in foreign countries.
   The White House also disclosed that Bush will travel to Chile
during a tour of five South American countries Dec. 2 to Dec. 8.
   The United States barred OPIC activities with Chile under
Aylwin's predecessor, military dictator Gen. Augosto Pinochet,
because of concerns about labor rights violations.

because of the publication of a passage from Hitler's ``Mein
Kampf'' in the combative student weekly.
   ``I joined a paper which embraced the conservative ideals and
attacked issues with daring style, often toeing the line of good
taste,'' C. Tyler White said Tuesday. ``Publicly insulting and
degrading the Jewish faith is neither a conservative ideal, nor is
it in good taste.''
   The resignation of Tyler and two Review writers came as a
petition drive against The Review collected more than 2,000
signatures. A protest rally of students and administrators was
planned for Thursday on the Ivy League campus.
   ``The main message we're trying to get across ... to the nation
and the national media is that The Dartmouth Review in no way
represents the campus,'' said Brian Ellner, president of the
Student Assembly, which represents the 3,200 undergraduates.
   The newspaper, which is not affiliated with Dartmouth College,
has in the past attacked blacks, women and homosexuals and tangled
with professors.
   The latest uproar involved an issue that was distributed
Saturday on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement and Judaism's
most solemn day.
   The quotation from Hitler was inserted unattributed into The
Review's masthead: ``Therefore, I believe today that I am acting in
the sense of the Almighty Creator: By warding off the Jews, I am
fighting for the Lord's work.''
   Review editors said the passage was put in by an unknown staffer
without their knowledge. The Review called the incident sabotage
and offered ``heartfelt apologies to Jews at Dartmouth and to the
Dartmouth community at lage.''
   But White said the response didn't express the staff's regret or
take responsibility for the passage getting into print - ``and now
we all must wear the albatross of anti-Semitism.''
   College officials joined students in condemning the weekly.
President James Freedman and other administrators planned to speak
at the rally.
   ``I think the campus is still in a state of semi-shock over this
- in the sense that it is an assault to the entire community,''
said Dean Edward Shanahan.
   Students have published The Review since 1980 with backing from
some of the nation's most prominent conservatives.
   One frequent target for criticism is William Cole, a black music
professor who resigned in August after seven years of being
belittled in print as a mediocre teacher. Cole said his
effectiveness had been compromised.
   Cole filed a $600,000 libel suit against the paper in 1983. It
was settled out of court for no money two years later.
   Review staffers also were involved in a sledgehammer attack on
shanties erected on campus as part of a protest against segregation
in South Africa several years ago. Several staffers were suspended.

   Share prices in Tokyo edged down Wednesday after
profit taking erased the market's early gains, and the dollar
closed marginally lower against the yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 2,676.55 points
Tuesday in its largest single-day rise ever, fell 49.02 points, or
0.21 percent, ending the day at 22,849.39. The index added 331.16
points before falling back in the afternoon.
   The dollar closed at 136.65 yen, down 0.08 yen from Tuesday's
close at 136.73 yen. It opened at 136.33 yen and ranged between
136.21 yen and 136.70 yen.
   Stock traders said the index lost almost 600 points in the first
30 minutes of afternoon trading on profit taking following
Tuesday's jump.
   They said the index's morning gain reflected optimism following
Monday's Finance Ministry announcement to take measures to support
the stock market, as well as declining oil prices and positive
developments in the Middle East.
   The stock support measures, aimed at spurring buying and
reducing market volatility, included easing restrictions on the
purchase of stock on credit and shortening the hours for futures
and options trading to curb speculation.
   Also, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto hinted Monday of the
possibility of easing interest rates temporarily to save the ailing
stock market.
   On the foreign exchange, dealers said falling oil prices
triggered the dollar's slip against the yen early Wednesday.
   But trading became volatile as market players made different
interpretations of Hashimoto's remarks, said Minori Takeuchi, a
dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   ``Lowering the interest rate encourages yen sales overseas,
whereas it is a yen-buying factor (here) because they (lower rates)
would help the Tokyo stock market recover,'' she said.
   Ms. Takeuchi said the rising Nikkei Stock Average and falling
oil prices stimulated yen buying among Japanese currency investors
Wednesday, but ``nobody is expecting much change from the current
level.''

   Four people who say a snooty bouncer at a
chic nightclub denied them entry and made them feel ``like scum''
because of their unhip clothing are asking a judge to decide
whether that's cool under the law.
   The four argued Tuesday in small claims court that their civil
rights were violated. They want damages of $250 apiece.
   The four - a lawyer, a termite company operator, an accountant
and an accounting manager from the San Fernando Valley - said they
were rejected by a doorman at the Mayan, a trendy downtown club
that used to be a porno theater.
   ``I think we were met at the door by a flippant and arrogant
doorman,'' Jeff Stolzer said in court. ``They just looked you over
like you were scum.''
   Municipal Court Commissioner Diana Wheatley said she would issue
a ruling later.
   Sammy Chao, president of the company that owns the Mayan, denied
any discrimination and argued that doormen pick and choose who to
let in to keep out troublemakers. He denied there was a dress code.
   Kenneth Lipton, 36, a personal injury lawyer specializing in dog
bites, Tess Dubrall, 34, an accounting manager, Stephen Ambrosini,
33, an accountant, and Stolzer, 35, who uns a termite company,
claim a violation of their rights under a state law passed in 1959
to end discrimination by businesses.
   All four waited in vain to get into the club after they
rendezvoused there May 19.
   Lipton wore his evidence to court. He arrived in the outfit he
had on that night - dark green dungarees, black loafers and a
sea-green shirt with a black design.
   For his part, Chao wore to court a black, Italian-cut suit with
a silk print tie and white shirt.
   Men routinely let into the club wear loose, baggy suits with
shirts buttoned at the collar. Less is more in terms of hemlines
for women.
   The black-robed commissioner was mostly interested in the
mechanics of the entry process, which was described as the doorman
choosing from a crowd gathered behind a semicircular rope.
   ``The places I go you can just walk in,'' Wheatley remarked.
``Obviously this is a more popular spot.''
   Chao said he hires doormen ``sensitive'' enough to ``see through
a person'' and screen out the intoxicated or dangerous.
   He said there was no discrimination on the basis of race or sex,
but that the number of people let in was limited for safety. In
addition, room must be saved for private parties and people with
reservations, Chao said.
   ``It's not Disneyland,'' he said. ``If we run a first-come,
first-served, we will soon be filled.''
   Outside court, Lipton outlined a broader purpose: halting the
spread of New York-style club entry policies to California.
   ``We just don't want the policy to come to Los Angeles and we
don't want it to expand - move to movies, bowling alleys. It hasn't
been legal since the 1950s,'' he said.

   German diplomats are trying to get word to
thousands of German-Americans who have only 10 days left to reclaim
land seized decades ago by East Germany's communist government.
   Charged with the task are the 10 German consulates scattered in
the United States and the German Embassy in Washington.
   The German consulate in Chicago has mailed hundreds of letters
to English and German-language newspapers and radio stations in its
nine-state region, where a large concentration of German
descendants live.
   Other consulates, such as the one in Boston, have attempted to
spread the word by contacting German clubs and organizations.
   ``What we are telling people is that they better claim the
property as soon as possible,'' said Cornelia Dautel, a German vice
consul in Chicago. ``If they wait until after October 13, they will
have much legal difficulty trying to reclaim the land.''
   East Germany and West Germany were joined Wednesday after months
of negotiations. Earlier this year, East Germany passeda law
permitting people to reclaim land that was seized after the
communists came to power in 1949.
   The Chicago consulate has received about 200 telephone calls
from people who hope to regain property they or their families
owned before World War II, Deputy Consul Karl Schon said.
   Elisabeth Jacoby of the Chicago suburb of Mount Prospect is one
of them.
   A resident of East Germany until she was 18, Jacoby crossed the
border into West Germany in 1951. She left behind her parents, her
sister and a childless uncle who owned a prominent hotel in
Wolmirstedt, a small city 45 miles east of the West German border.
   The government converted the hotel into a store in the 1960s,
then tore down the building in 1972.
   Almost 40 years after their uncle's death in 1951, Jacoby, her
sister and a cousin who lives in West Germany finally have hope of
reclaiming the land on which the hotel stood.
   ``Before the borders came down and everything changed, there was
nothing we could do,'' Jacoby said. ``We had given up hope.''
   The government controls the land, which is now being used as a
parking lot. But the women - as their uncle's only heirs - are
entitled to it under his will, Jacoby said Tuesday.
   ``Both my parents worked in that hotel,'' Jacoby said. ``We feel
our family worked very hard for what they had and we should not let
the East German government have it.''
   Jacoby's claim is one of more than 1 million - most from West
German residents - that the East German government has received
since it allowed such claims to be filed.
   The claims will be evaluated by the local governments where the
property is situated. Those who prove they are entitled to the
property will be compensated for the land or receive title to the
property if possible, Schon said.
   ``It's question of proof,'' Schon said. ``If a person can
establish through the real estate register or other records that he
is entitled to the property, then the law says it must be returned
to him.''

   A skier suspended from a team for the
disabled after coaches questioned her blindness has been charged
with misrepresenting herself to sponsors.
   Julie Wallace, 26, was charged with theft involving less than
$1,000 in cash and benefits.
   Wallace was suspended from the U.S. Disabled Ski Team in January
after coaches questioned her blindness and her claims that she had
leukemia, earned advanced degrees from two universities and served
as a Navy SEAL.
   She was barred from participating in world competition for the
disabled in February.
   District Attorney Greg Long said Monday the charges were filed
after Wallace failed to honor an agreement that she seek counseling
and get an eye exam to determine whether she is blind.
   Wallace has said she has medical proof that she is totally blind
and has leukemia and a brain tumor. She is believed to be living in
Traverse City, Mich., and will be arrested if she returns to
Colorado, Long said.
   The U.S. Health and Human Services office in Denver also is
investigating Wallace's receipt of Social Security payments, Long
said.

<TEXT>
   A cargo door that blew off a United Airlines
jet, sweeping nine people to their death, has been brought ashore
for examination by safety investigators after being raised from the
floor of the Pacific.
   The Navy submarine Sea Cliff retrieved the final piece of the
door Monday from its resting place 14,100 feet down and 90 miles
south of Honolulu.
   The submarine and its support ship returned to Pearl Harbor on
Tuesday.
   The discovery ended a needle-in-a-haystack search of the ocean
floor that began when a sonar-scanning submersible found debris
from the jet in July. The three-man submarine recovered the bottom
half of the door last week.
   National Transportation Safety Board officials moved the two
halves of the door to a hangar at Honolulu International Airport.
   Investigators want to know why the door tore away at 22,000 feet
shortly after the Boeing 747 took off from Honolulu in 1989 for New
Zealand with 355 passengers. The crew managed to return the jet to
Honolulu.
   After investigators examine the debris, parts of it will be sent
to the Boeing Co. in Seattle for a more detailed review under board
direction, said Navy spokeswoman Sandy Stairs.
   The NTSB determined that faulty design of a locking mechanism
probably caused a cockpit light to indicate falsely that the door
was locked. But the agency wants to examine the door to confirm its
findings and perhaps bring about better safety rules.
   The agency blamed United, Boeing and the Federal Aviation
Administration for failing to corect problems with the door. It
asked the Navy to find the door.

<HEAD>Robbers Use Chain Saw to Get Victim's Watch and Rings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNION GAP, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two holdup men used a chain saw to cut
off the left hand of an out-of-work migrant farm worker to steal
his expensive watch and two rings, police say.
   ``They did it for the sheer joy of doing it. That kind of random
violence is frightening,'' Police Chief Lane Roberts said Tuesday.
   The victim, a 20-year-old believed to be from Mexico, asked that
his name not be released. He was listed in stable condition at
Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital.
   Investigators said they had no suspects.
   The victim, a newcomer to the area who speaks little English,
told police through an interpreter he was with his cousin and was
looking for work.
   The two were at a grocery store Friday night in this poor Yakima
suburb and were approached by two men who offered to sell them a
chain saw, Roberts said.
   One of the men pulled a gun and the two victims were forced into
their own car and driven to a remote area, where the hold-up men
tried to remove the victim's jewelry, Roberts said.
   The police chief said the man's watch, valued at $1,500, had a
special security latch that was difficult to open. ``It's not
something where you reach down with your thumb and pop it loose,''
he said.
   The victim tried to show the robbers how to remove the watch,
but they apparently ``saw this as resistance and took the most
expedient method to get to it,'' Roberts said.
   He said one man held the victim down and the other used the
chain saw. The robbers then escaped in a vehicle driven by an
accomplice, Roberts said.
   The victim's 39-year-old cousin, who has been in the United
States for eight years, was not harmed and drove him to the
hospital, the chief said.
   ``When people are there with a chain saw, you have to wonder if
they are not looking for an opportunity to do something bizarre,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   As Germans poured champagne and exploded
fireworks to celebrate unification today, Poles living on Europe's
new dividing line looked on with reserve, expressing hope, fear and
a little envy.
   Prior to the celebration, German youths shouting pro-German
slogans threw stones at two Polish buses picking up factory workers
across the border in Frankfurt an der Oder.
   Precisely at midnight, fireworks exploded over the German city
and the border station commanders saluted the flag of the German
Federal Republic. Earlier, the German guards changed out of their
gray uniforms and into the dark green uniforms of the West German
units.
   In the waning hours of East Germany's nationhood, shoppers had
rushed across the bridge spanning the Oder, which separates Slubice
from Frankfurt.
   Restrictive border regulations were about to take effect at
midnight, and thousands of Germans flooded Slubice to shop cheaply
in Poland. Throngs filled sidewalks, and lawns turned into parking
lots for East German cars.
   Amid the crush of commerce and bargaining in two languages, some
Poles paused to voice their anxiety at the prospect of having a
rich, powerful and populous united Germany a few steps away.
   ``We can't forget these fears until someday Europe becomes
united. Look at our history,'' said Andrzej Macewski. The visiting
engineer-turned-street trader from Lodz recalled the agony of World
War II, in which 6 million Poles died, and the long list of
Polish-German conflicts that preceded it.
   Some residents of Slubice were less concerned.
   ``I won't speak badly about the Germans. They come here often
and they are very nice. They are our neighbors,'' said
businesswoman Katarzyna Taczyniec, who owns two clothing shops in
town.
   Jacek Walentynowicz, a Polish worker in a German tire factory,
was pessimistic: ``A German and a Pole have never been brothers.''
   ``The younger generation is not so sure about that,'' replied
Andrzej, a 25-year-old Polish border guard who would not give his
last name.
   He agreed with the new German border commander, Ultun Topp, that
the ``outer border'' between Eastern and Western Europe is now the
Oder, which is neatly banked by a brick wall on the Frankfurt side
and undulates around low sand bars on the Slubice side.
   Topp said the tighter travel restrictions are needed on the new
border because ``we have to control it for all the people in the
European Community. But I believe there will come a time when all
the visas will fall away, like with Czechoslovakia. I hope so.''
   Walentynowicz had come to the border station to learn if he
would be able to go to work today without the newly required visa.
   He was told he would be let across with proof of German
employment. All in all, he said, he is indifferent to unification,
``except that I could lose my job.''
   Some of the Poles returning from Germany expressed resentment at
a policy requiring visas for Poles visiting what had been East
Germany and Berlin.
   In the past, no visas had been needed for Berlin, and only an
invitation for East Germany.
   The many Poles from this region who work in what was East
Germany fear they may now lose their jobs.
   The German youths who threw stones at the Polish buses shattered
windows and injured both drivers. Youths wielding sticks pounded
two Polish cars waiting to cross the border.
   ``To me, it seems horrifying,'' said one passenger, Halina
Gawronska. ``We welcome them with open arms and then this. We live
together. ... How could they?''
   ``There was always great friendship, but now we don't know what
is going on,'' said a companion, Genewa Kowalska.
   Anti-Polish attitudes spawned in part by aggressive commerce in
both directions across the river and long-held antagonisms.
   The border along the Oder and Neisse rivers was created after
World War II. One-third of Poland is land forfeited by a defeated
Germany.
   Some Germans have never relinquished claims to the former lands.
   During unification talks, Poland extracted promises from the
parliaments of both Germanys that the border would be made final in
a treaty between Poland and the united Germany's new government.

<HEAD>Casino Opens in Tiny Reservation Town</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gamblers drawn by $1 million jackpots and
pickup trucks as prizes are trying their luck at South Dakota's
first Indian casino, the newest hope of prosperity for the
hard-pressed Santee Sioux tribe.
   The casino, in the style of Las Vegas and Atlantic City, N.J.,
opened Tuesday with slot machines, card games and bingo on a dusty
plot of reservation land surrounded by cornfields outside
Flandreau, population 2,200.
   The town is small but the stakes are high for gamblers as well
as the Sioux, who stand to earn $750,000 to $1 million in the
casino's first year.
   Some of the slot machines offer a jackpot of $1 million. Others
offer new Ford pickups as top prizes.
   The tribe is the first of nine in South Dakota to receive state
permission to open a casino under the National Indian Gaming Act of
1988, based on a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that once a state
allows any form of gambling, Indian tribes can offer the same
games, without government restriction.
   ``It's cheaper than flying to Las Vegas and paying for plane
fare and hotels,'' said Sondra Feldman, who played the slots with
her husband, Norm.
   ``I think it'll go over good,'' said Mrs. Feldman, who lives in
nearby Sioux Falls.
   Jim Lewis, who developed the casino for the tribe, said he'll
make slightly less than the amount he estimates will go to the
Santee Sioux each year. He also wants to develop a supper club and
two hotels across from the casino.
   The casino's bingo section is hooked to the Megabingo network
that links bingo operations of other tribes. The network offers a
prize of $500,000 every night and $1 million on Saturdays.
   Thirty-five people were in line when the doors opened at 9 a.m.
By noon, Lewis estimated 300 people had gone through the casino.
Many in the crowd were retirees. Some people stopped by on their
lunch breaks. A check of license plates in the dirt parking lot
showed most were from South Dakota, with some from Minnesota.
   ``I think come this weekend, we should be seeing 3,000 people
through the doors,'' Lewis said.
   Flandreau is one of only two places where gambling is allowed in
South Dakota, which will soon join a regional lottery network with
neighboring states.
   Gambling began in 1989 in Deadwood, the Black Hills gold rush
town where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down in 1876 while playing
poker. Since May, gambling has brought the town nearly 1,000 jobs
and strained streets, parking lots and water and sewer systems.
   The state Gaming Commission has approved gambling licenses for
at least 50 businesses in Deadwood.
   Casino supporters in Flandreau say it will bring much-needed
jobs and economic development.
   Indians are going through tough times in South Dakota. On nine
reservations, unemployment is about 80 percent and alcoholism,
drugs and poor health are severe. South Dakota has about 45,000
Indians, more than 6 percent of its population.
   Some of the gamblers pouring money into the casino's coffers
said they wouldn't want one in their hometown.
   ``It's not too good for the people,'' said Don Cover of Madison.
``It seems the people who can't afford to spend the most money. I
think they can come up with other ways to raise money.''

   David Souter can't get cable TV for the
black-and-white set at his farmhouse, so he watched himself become
the Supreme Court's newest justice at a friend's law office.
   The soft-spoken judge toasted the moment with champagne and was
cheered by friends after the Senate approved his nomination 90-9
Tuesday night.
   ``I have read in more than one place remarks by members of the
Supreme Court who have said that nothing prepares a person to
assume the responsibilities of that office,'' he told reporters.
``I believe very strongly that I am going to feel the same way.''
   Souter, a 51-year-old bachelor of spartan tastes, drove himself
the 12 miles from his farmhouse in his native Weare to the Concord
law office of his friend, Tom Rath, to watch the Senate debate.
   In a parking garage, reporters watched as he struggled with an
electronic meter that refused to acknowledge his quarters.
   ``I'll tell you I've certainly got a lot of witnesses that I
tried to put money in the meter,'' he joked. ``So if I get a
ticket, you guys are witnesses.''
   Souter appeared stunned into silence after the vote and about 20
minutes of celebration and calls from President Bush, Vice
President Dan Quayle and Justice Anthony Kennedy, until now the
high court's newest member.
   Souter was driven a block to the Statehouse and ducked into Gov.
Judd Gregg's office.
   He later emerged to address reporters and state employees.
   ``Both the president's nomination and the Senate's confirmation
are wholly beyond the scope of any thanks I could give to them,''
he said.

<HEAD>NJ Candidates Try to Tie Opponents to Florio's Tax Hike</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs 2nd graf, ``Many Democrats xxx to CORRECT seven months

<TEXT>
   Republican candidates in New Jersey are trying
to capitalize on taxpayer anger by linking their opponents to
Democratic Gov. Jim Florio and his $2.8 billion tax package.
   Many Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to distance themselves
from the governor who pushed through the state's biggest tax hike
after just five months in office.
   In New Jersey's 12th Congressional District, Democrat Marguerite
Chandler's radio ads start with an attack on Florio instead of her
GOP opponent.
   State Sen. Richard A. Zimmer, who also is trying to tap into
discontent with the state's Democratic administration, responded
with a reminder that Mrs. Chandler just four months ago
congratulated the governor for his courage in tackling the budget
deficit.
   His campaign ads warn that Mrs. Chandler could do what Florio
did: promise no new taxes and then flip-flop once elected.
   Florio has blamed the state's budget woes on former Republican
Gov. Thomas H. Kean, claiming he was forced to break a campaign
promise against raising major taxes because he didn't know how bad
things were.
   Republicans watched their gubernatorial nominee, Rep. James
Courter, go down in a landslide last fall. Now they are predicting
that Florio's tax package could revive their prospects for
recovery.
   ``There is going to be a price to be paid by every Democrat who
ran around New Jersey last year calling for the election of Jim
Florio as governor of New Jersey,'' said Robert Franks, the state
Republican chairman.
   Democrats concede the issue has caught on to some degree.
   ``Will the tax issue have an effect? Yes, it's probably going to
have at least a marginal effect in every race,'' said Stephan
DeMicco, executive director of the New Jersey State Democratic
Committee.
   The question is whether the GOP can make the issue stick on
Eection Day.
   ``Republicans surprisingly have not been able to make a coherent
argument that Democratic candidates for Congress should be held
accountable for the actions of a Democratic governor,'' said
Richard Roper, director of the Council on New Jersey Affairs at
Princeton University.
   Roper, who advised the Florio campaign last year, said that in
the U.S. Senate race, long-shot GOP challenger Christine Todd
Whitman has been unable to force Democratic incumbent Bill Bradley
to speak out about the Florio taxes.
   ``We are distancing ourselves from the particulars of the tax
package because Sen. Bradley had nothing to do with it,'' said Nick
Donatiello, Bradley's campaign manager.
   Roper said tax anger should influence the race in Florio's old
House district, where Democratic nominee Robert Andrews is
perceived as Florio's chosen successor.
   ``I do think it's likely the Democratic candidate in south
Jersey's 1st District may suffer as a result of his association
with the Florio organization in Camden County,'' Roper said.
   Franks said GOP polling has detected resentment against Florio
in his former backyard.
   ``People in his home area feel very much betrayed in terms of
his rhetoric during the campaign and the product he delivered,''
Franks said.
   Democrats also should not discount the power of the grass-roots
anti-tax movement in the 3rd District along the Jersey Shore,
Franks said.
   In that race, Republican challenger Paul Kapalko is trying to
link incumbent Democrat Frank Pallone Jr. to Florio. Pallone,
however, is running as an anti-tax candidate.
   Roper foresees no Democratic casualties from the GOP's anti-tax
strategy.
   ``The people who are up for re-election on the Democratic side,
especially for the U.S. Senate, are extremely popular and are not
likely to be painted with the Florio tax brush,'' Roper says.
   But the GOP is betting on its anti-Florio strategy, offering
local candidates cable TV spots admonishing voters that if they
want to send Florio a message this fall, they should vote
Republican.

<HEAD>Accountant Finds Manuscript of Mozart Works</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An accountant looking through an old safe at
a Baptist seminary has found a lost manuscript of two famous Mozart
piano works.
   ``I thought, gee, this couldn't be real, these are in an archive
in the Louvre or somewhere in a museum,'' Judy DiBona said Tuesday.
   The 14-page original manuscript of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's
``Fantasia in C Minor'' and the ``Sonata in C Minor'' will be
auctioned Nov. 21 in London. Sotheby's auction house said it is
worth between $940,000 and $1.4 million.
   The whereabouts of the brown-ink manuscript had been unknown
since the 1915 death of its American owner, William H. Doane of
Cincinnati.
   Found with it were lesser compositions by Franz Joseph Haydn,
Johann Strauss the Elder and others. They are expected to fetch a
total of about $110,000 at the same sale.
   Manfred Brauch, president of Eastern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Philadelphia, said the manuscripts had been listed in
insurance records since 1984. But the insurance company was not
aware of the potential value, he said.
   Ms. DiBona, accounting manager at the sister Eastern College in
nearby St. Davids, found the Mozart manuscript in a vault within a
vault in July while looking for historical records.
   ``I hummed it and played it with my fingers - I'm a pianist,''
she said. ``I can't express the feeling of joy to be the first one
to touch these manuscripts in years.''
   Doane, a composer of hymns and a philanthropist, left the
manuscripts to his widow. They were passed to his daughter, who in
1950 donated them with funds to build a chapel and music rooms at
the seminary, Brauch said.
   ``Scholars have not seen this Mozart manuscript since the early
19th century,'' said Stephen Roe, a Sotheby's expert on music
manuscripts. ``It went through several hands and crossed the
Atlantic to Doane's collection in 1889.
   ``The two works have been played regularly by great pianists
since Mozar's time and he himself performed the `Fantasia' in
1789. They contain some of his most moving music in the minor
key,'' Roe said.
   Eugene K. Wolf, professor of music at University of
Pennsylvania, was asked to authenticate the manuscript. ``It was
immediately apparent that this was the lost manuscript,'' he said.
   Wolf, a specialist in 18th century instrumental music, said the
manuscripts ``were in two manila envelopes that merely said `sacred
music' on the outside. That's not likely to stir your interest.''
   The works were written in 1784 and 1785 when Mozart was in his
late 20s. They are usually performed together.
   Wolf said the manuscript has great interest for scholars. ``It
contains two sets of variations on the main theme, one of which has
never been known before,'' he said. ``It tells us about Mozart's
compositional process.''
   Brauch said the manuscript will be displayed at the seminary
Oct. 15. That evening, the two works will be be performed at the
seminary chapel.

   A police officer following a bloody trail from
the street into a woman's kitchen arrested her on charges of nearly
hacking off the hand of a man she believed had molested her
granddaughter, police said.
   Geraldine Jackson, 44, was jailed on charges of assault with
intent to maim in the attack on Wardell Leverette, 47.
   A police officer found Leverette was lying in a street early
Tuesday, bleeding profusely, police Agent Alene Jenkins said.
   ``The officer followed the blood trail... where he encountered
the suspect. The suspect was cleaning the kitchen. She was mopping
the blood in the kitchen,'' Jenkins said.
   Leverette was listed in good condition at University Hospital.
   Police said Jackson told them that Leverette, a former boyfriend
of Jackson's sister, had fondled her granddaughter and that ``she
was going to cut his arm off so he couldn't touch any other
children.''
   Two hatchets and two knives were found in the house, police
said.
   The girl was examined at University of Maryland Medical Center,
where doctors found no physical evidence of abuse, police said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices fell slightly today in Tokyo, dashing
hopes that the market's record recovery the day before had signaled
a turnaround from a nine-month decline.
   Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 136.65 yen, down 0.08 yen from
Tuesday's clos of 136.73 yen. It opened at 136.33 yen and ranged
between 136.21 yen and 136.70 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 2,676.55 points
Tuesday in its largest daily gain ever, fell 49.02 points, or 0.21
percent, ending the day at 22,849.39. Today's trading was moderate
with 600 million shares changed hands on the first section.
   The market's key index closed the morning session 331.16 points
higher, but that was the end of an afterglow left by government
support measures that triggered Tuesday's surge, traders said. They
said the index lost about 600 points within the first 30 minutes of
afternoon trading as profit takers dumped issues.
   Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with Nomura Securities Co., said
Tuesday's rise ``would not set a new trend, although expectations
about easier monetary policy reassured investors.''
   ``I think the market has not hit bottom. It's going to fall some
more,'' he said. On Tuesday ``many investors were confused by the
sudden changes in the market and were not quite sure what they
should be doing.''
   In the first nine months of this year, the market has lost
17,932.37 points, or 46.1 percent, from last year's close at
38,915.87. The losses are equivalent to $2.1 trillion.
   ``The market will continue to seek its bottom for awhile,'' said
Kazu Nomura, a trader with New Japan Securities Co. ``The market's
environment is so bad and pessimistic. Investors have no buying
incentive.''
   On Monday, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced a series
of measures aimed at spurring buying and reducing market
volatility. The measures include easing restrictions on stock
purchases on credit and shorter hours for futures and options
trading to stymie speculators. Hashimoto also mentioned the
possibility of easing monetary policy temporarily.
   Some analysts say an easier monetary policy for the sake of
revitalizing the stock market should be only a temporary measure.
Over a longer period, a looser monetary policy amid higher oil
prices and the tight labor market could ignite inflation, they say.
   Nikko Securities chief trader Yoshio Ogawa said the index would
have risen farther if a computer breakdown had not halted 45
minutes of morning trading.
   ``Quick recovery only in terms of the index's gains is no good.
The market should digest both buying and selling at the same time
and rise back little by little,'' Ogawa said.
   Traders said rising oil prices and some positive developments in
the Gulf crisis, including a recent release of some French hostages
from Iraq, contributed the Nikkei's morning increase.
   The index's afternoon plunge was fueled by large-scale selling
by foreign brokerages following a false rumor about fighting in the
Gulf, said Nomura of New Japan Securities.
   Japan is highly vulnerable to unrest in the Gulf because it
imports virtually all its oil, with 70 percent of it coming from
the Middle East.
   Meanwhile, an economic forecast released by the Research
Institute on the National Economy, a privately funded think tank,
predicted that stock market declines will inflict only minor
damages on the Japanese economy.
   ``Losing a bubble is rather a plus to the Japanese economy in
the long run,'' it said. ``A series of stock market plunges paved
the way for growth with balance between actual economy and
financial markets.''
   On the foreign exchange, dealers said falling oil prices
triggered the dollar's slip against the yen earlier today.
   Lower oil prices helped the yen gain slightly against the dollar
and the European currencies early today, but rumors of fighting in
the Middle East discouraged the yen buying in the afternoon
session, dealers said.
   They said investorsavoided major moves ahead of testimony later
today by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Friday's
release of U.S. jobless rate.
   Chemical Bank dealer Minori Takeuchi said market players were
hoping to get clues of the Fed's policy on interest rates, which
have been widely expected to fall.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 8.310 percent, up from
Tuesday's 8.185-percent close. Their price ended lower at 82.32
points from 82.81.
   Bond dealers said a rumor, also false, that a U.S. fighter jet
was shot down in the Gulf sent bond prices lower.

<TEXT>
   A 35-nation conference of foreign ministers
ended with statements of concern about the volatile gulf region,
but hope of a treaty to limit conventional arms in Europe.
   The members of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe (CSCE) said they were joining the United Nations in
condemning Iraq's seizure of Kuwait.
   A statement from the conference said the Aug. 2 invasion
``jeopardizes the just and peaceful world order to which more
cooperative European relations are making an important
contribution.''
   The conference, which ended Tuesday, included officials from 33
European countries, Canada and the United States.
   Participants also accepted the U.S. position that an arms
reduction treaty should be settled before a planned European-North
American summit to be held in Paris Nov. 19-21. Talks on the treaty
are under way in Vienna.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, whose countries lead the Vienna
talks, said prospects are good for an accord.
   The two planned to meet today before Shevardnadze returns to
Moscow.
   The arms talks have been on a fast track since they opened in
March 1989 between negotiators for the 16 nations of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the seven of the now-crumbling
Warsaw Pact.
   They were designed to bring both sides to equal ceilings in
troops and conventional weapons from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural
Mountains.
   The two-day CSCE session in New York was the first held in the
United States. The conferences began in 1975 in Finland.
   ``The objectives set out in Helsinki in 1975 have been realized
to a degree unforeseen even a few years ago,'' said Tuesday's
communique. ``Ministers agreed that the role of CSCE must be
enhanced to respond to new opportunities for cooperation.''
   Referring to today's entrance on the world stage of a reunified
Germany, Baker said ``a new era is beginning for Germany, for
Europe and, indeed, we hope for the world.''
   Baker said a proposed permanent secretariat location for the
CSCE could be possible in Eastern European. Prague, Czechoslovakia,
has become a leading candidate for the site.

   Clear skies prevailed over much of the nation today, but rain
was forecast in the Midwest and Pacific Northwest and snow was
expected in Colorado.
   Temperatures along the East Coast were expected to be in the 60s
and 70s in the north to the 80s farther south, with sunny skies
forcast for most of the region.
   Sunny weather was also forecast for much of the West, with highs
in the 60s in the Pacific Northwest and the 80s in California.
Highs in the 90s were forecast for the Southwest desert and much of
Texas and Florida.
   Strong winds were expected across the Mississippi Valley and the
Great Lakes region.
   Rain was also forecast from the Great Lakes area all the way
south into Oklahoma and Texas, with heavy rain in parts of Texas.
   Forecasters said the higher elevations in Colorado could get as
much as 3 inches of snow.
   The high temperature for the nation Tuesday was 98 degrees at
Meridian, Miss.

   The animated raisins that danced off the
vine and into the hearts of American consumers are sitting out the
next TV commercial, yielding the advertising spotlight to a new
clay character.
   The California Raisin Advisory Board and its advertising
company, which since 1986 have used award-winning Will Vinton
Productions for memorable ``Claymation'' television ads, said
Tuesday they have chosen a new studio.
   ``There are some slightly different things we wanted to try,''
said Louise Ure, vice president of Foote Cone &amp; Belding, an
advertising studio that handles the board's commercials.
   ``It's just that there are other options out there, more clay
animators.''
   The shade-wearing raisins that strutted to ``I Heard it Through
the Grapevine'' - and appeared on T-shirts and dozens of other
products - will be succeeded by a commercial by Sculptoons, a San
Francisco studio whose owners are former animators with Portland,
Ore.-based Will Vinton.
   The new spots will feature an animated clay version of actor
Carl Ballantine, who appeared as Gruber in the 1960s TV series
``McHale's Navy,'' said Tom Gasek, co-owner of Sculptoons.
``Ballantine'' will play the raisins' manager.
   Ure said California raisins will appear in the commercials,
which are expected to air next month, but he declined to discuss
details. Gasek, however, said the raisins wouldn't be singing or
dancing.
   ``You'll see a raisin phone, a raisin lamp, things like that,''
she said.
   Will Vinton Productions, which won an Academy Award in 1975 for
its first animated short, ``Closed Monday,'' was disappointed but
not disturbed by the decision.
   ``We feel kind of strange not doing the new commercial, but it's
not hurtful to us; we normally do between 20 and 30 commercials for
various clients, so one commercial'' won't make much of a
difference, said Robert Phinney, vice president. Another of the
studio's creations is the ``Noid'' character seen on Domino's Pizza
commercials.
   He and Ure - whose company seeks bids from various studios for
each raisin ad rather than contracting with one firm - said their
companies had a good relationship and hoped to work together again.
   Will Vinton's seven dancing raisin commercials enjoyed critical
and practical success since the clay figures' September 1986 debut.
   The spots won four Clio awards for advertising excellence and
helped boost sales of raisins, a $500 million industry in the
state's Central Valley. Over a 3{-year period ending last year,
U.S. consumption rose nearly 20 percent, said Linda Wood,
spokeswoman for the California Raisin Advisory Board.
   California farmers sold more raisins in 1989 than in any other
year except 1984, when growers dropped the price about 30 percent,
Ure said.
   ``It took everyone by surprise,'' she said of the commercials'
success. ``We thought it had great promise but we were absolutely
astounded by the way the American people embraced the dancing
raisins. ...
   ``There's a certain charm to the characters, and the music is
great. It is so reminiscent for people of a great time in our
lives. ... It made people think about raisins a lot more.''
   The TV spots also spawned dancing raisin T-shirts, lunch boxes,
beach towels and other products.
   ``You name it, we had it. We had about 300 items,'' Wood said.
The number of raisin products has now dropped to about 10, but
sales of the fruit itself are holding steady, Wood said.

<HEAD>Somber Ceremony At Holocaust Memorial For United Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Germany's top diplomat in Israel laid a wreath
today in memory of the 6 million Jews slain in the Holocaust after
assuring Israel that his reunited country would never reject
responsibility for its Nazi past.
   The somber ceremony at the Yad Vashem memorial to the Jewish
victims of the Nazis underscored the sadness and worry felt by many
Israelis over the merging of East and West Germany.
   The speaker of Israel's Parliament, Dov Shilansky, himself a
concentration camp survivor, called on Israelis to recite the
``Kaddish,'' a Hebrew prayer of mourning.
   ``Today the murderers from both sides are unified,'' he said on
Israel radio. ``Germany has a stain on its clothing that cannot be
removed.''
   Polish-born Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, whose parents died in
the Holocaust, met briefly at his office with German Charge
d'Affaires Heimo Richter before the ceremony at Yad Vashem.
   Richter handed Shamir a letter from Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
restating Germany's commitment to maintain ``friendship and
cooperation'' with Israel, Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said.
   Shamir told Richter he was ``disappointed there was no mention
of the Holocaust'' in the German unification treaty, Pazner added.
   But the premier also sent ``good wishes to Kohl because this is
a day of much significance to the German people,'' Pazner said.
   Shamir later published a statement urging Germany ``to do its
utmost, by all possible means, political, educational and legal, to
make sure that what happened in the past will not recur, and that
anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi phenomena will be combatted.''
   Richter, speaking later to the gathering of about 100
dignitaries at Yad Vashem, said:
   ``Our one essential message is we remain aware of our historic
responsibility. The crimes committed by the Germans and in the name
of Germany will never be forgotten.''
   Richter symbolically re-lighted an eternal flame in memory of
Holocaust victims and laid a wreath in his country's name.

   Chinese authorities said today that at
least 127 people were killed and more than 40 seriously injured
when a hijacked plane crashed into two parked jets at this
southeastern city's airport.
   The Xinhua News Agency said that in addition to 90 Chinese, the
dead included one American, 30 Taiwanese, four people from Hong
Kong and two from Macao. The U.S. Embassy declined to identify the
dead American.
   But Scottie Gilbert of Alexander City, Ala., said she believed
her daughter, Mary Anna Gilbert, was killed in the crash. Ms.
Gilbert had been traveling with the only known American survivor.
   A Boeing 737 belonging to China's state-owned airline slammed
into the two parked jets at Canton's international airport early
Tuesday and exploded in a ball of flames.
   One of the parked jets was empty. The other, a Boeing 757, was
packed with passengers and bound for Shanghai.
   ``Many people were injured badly and burned,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We have more than
40 seriously injured people now.''
   He said 80 out of the 103 people on board the Boeing 737 died
and 47 of the 124 people aboard the Boeing 757 were killed.
   Quoting air traffic controllers, the official said the hijacker
appeared confused about where he wanted to go.
   ``At one time he said Hong Kong, then he said Taiwan,'' the
official said. ``We are investigating whether he was a terrorist.''
   The hijacking and crash came as China hosts its first major
international sporting event, the Asian Games. Security forces
nationwide have been on alert to prevent any incidents that might
embarrass the government.
   The hijacker, a 27-year-old man, was killed in the crash and his
remains have been recovered, officials said. Reports reaching Hong
Kong said he sneaked into the cockpit after the plane took off from
Xiamen, a southern Chinese port, by offering the cabin crew some
flowers.
   Survivors told of a huge explosion.
   Chinese officials said the pilot was allowed to handle the
situation ``as he saw fit.''
   Early today, relatives of some Chinese passengers yelled at
Chinese officials and demanded information about their loved ones
during a news conference at the China Hotel.
   ``They aren't telling us anything,'' said one middle-aged
Chinese man. ``It's been 16 hours and still they tell us nothing.''
   Chinese authorities released a manifest of the Boeing 737's
passengers this afternoon. One of the survivors was Erin Lynne
Thomas of Oklahoma City.
   Ms. Thomas suffered a broken shoulder, head injuries and third
degree burns over 5 percent of her body, said her doctor, Zhao
Weiming.
   He was treating wounds on Ms. Thomas' legs this morning when
tears came to her eyes. ``I need rest,'' she said. She declined to
speak further.
   Ms. Thomas and Ms. Gilbert had been sitting together, officials
said.
   The plane, Flight 8305 of the Civil Aviation Administration, was
hijacked after taking off from Xiamen.
   The plane flew to Canton, where it circled the airport for about
40 minutes before crashing.
   Chinese officials, Western diplomats and witnesses provided
conflicting accounts of the disaster.
   A Western survivor said there was a struggle in the cockpit of
the hijacked plane as it landed at the airport, causing the craft
to careen into the other planes. Other unconfirmed reports said the
hijacker detonated a bomb as the plane landed.
   The accident was the worst publicly acknowledged air disaster in
China. In 1982, a civil aviation Trident crashed in the southern
city of Guilin, killing 112 people. China rarely disclosed
disasters before the 1980s.

   Tony Award-winning actress Lauren
Bacall says the theater is still her first love, but Broadway just
isn't the same anymore and she'd rather work in smaller venues
outside New York.
   The former wife of actor Jason Robards complained during a talk
at Town Hall here Monday that Broadway's emphasis on reviving old
hits in recent years has limited opportunities for actors.
   ``I'm tired of revivals. I would rather be on stage in Chicago
or in a good repertory theater in Seattle than be doing some of the
things available on Broadway,'' she said.
   Miss Bacall, who won Tonys for ``Applause'' and ``Woman of the
Year,'' credited her late husband Humphrey Bogart for her success.
He starred opposite her in her first movie, ``To Have and Have
Not,'' in 1944.
   ``Bogie was the best teacher I had,'' she said. ``He showed me
the ropes. Until I met him, I believed everything I read.''

<HEAD>Teacher With AIDS Who Won Right to Keep Job Dies at 45</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vincent Chalk, the teacher who won a
landmark ruling guaranteeing job security for public employees with
AIDS, has died. He was 45.
   Chalk died Tuesday at Saint Mary Medical Center after a
three-year bout with AIDS, said his attorney, Marjorie Rushforth.
He was admitted to the hospital Thursday.
   Chalk taught hearing-impaired students at Venado Middle School
and University High School in Irvine.
   ``Vincent settled for every person with AIDS who had a federally
related paycheck their right to maintain their employment in spite
of an AIDS diagnosis,'' Ms. Rushforth said.
   When Chalk reported to his superiors in 1987 that he had AIDS,
he was removed from the classroom and given an office job.
   Chalk sued the Orange County Department of Education to be
reinstated to teaching. In November 1987, the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals overturned a lower court ruling and allowed Chalk
to resume teaching.
   Pearl Jemison-Smith, chairwoman of the Orange County HIV
advisory committee, said Chalk ``did for schoolteachers with AIDS
what Ryan White did for students with AIDS.'' She was referring to
the Indiana youngster who waged a successful battle against AIDS
discrimination in public schools. Ryan died April 8.
   Chalk is survived by his companion, John Woesner, his parents
and two sisters.

   Iraq built its extensive arsenal of chemical
and biological weapons with the aid of more than 200 Western
companies, including more than a dozen in the United States, a
research agency reports.
   A report released by the Simon Wiesenthal Center says at least
207 companies sold Iraq chemicals and advanced technology needed to
produce and deploy toxic agents, which could be used against U.S.
forces in the Persian Gulf.
   Sales by U.S. companies were approved by the government, but
those by German companies often were illegal, the report said.
   ``We know there is a possibility of a war. What we do not know
is we are fighting against ourselves,'' Wiesenthal Center founder
Rabbi Marvin Hier said at a news conference.
   ``If Americans are killed, the people responsible are not those
in Iraq, but those in the West, who gave them the technology,''
Hier said.
   Because of the Third Reich's use of poison gas to kill Jews and
others during the Holocaust, the German government had a particular
reponsibility to prosecute those involved in illegal sales to Iraq,
Hier argued.
   ``It's not fair to judge today's generation of Germans on the
past,'' he said. ``It is fair to judge the current administration
on its willingness to sell chemical weapons to Saddam Hussein.''
   The 55-page report was compiled for the center by Middle East
Defense News, a Paris-based newsletter. The Wiesenthal center, a
private foundation, investigates issues related to the Holocaust
and tracks Nazi war criminals.
   Renate Friedmann, spokeswoman for the German consulate in Los
Angeles, said her government was cracking down on companies that
conducted illegal business with Iraq. But she said some sales
involved seemingly innocuous chemicals that did not become lethal
until combined with other substances.
   Among the suppliers cited in the center's report was the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control, which sent a deadly virus called West
Nile Fever virus to an Iraqi scientist, not knowing it might be
used for military purposes.
   Chuck Fallis, spokesman for the CDC in Atlanta, said the center
sent strains to Basrah University in response to a request from an
Iraqi researcher who spent three months in 1985 at the CDC's lab in
Fort Collins, Colo. Fallis said the center had no indication the
virus was used for sinister purposes.
   The Wiesenthal center's report also said that Hewlett-Packard
sold computers that were used in rocket development.
Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman Marlene Somsak said the company relied
on the U.S. government for guidance in making equipment sales to
Iraq.
   Hier urged sharper controls on legal sales of chemicals and
technology. He also said that governments should apply criminal
penalties to executives of companies that make illegal sales rather
than simply fine the company.
   The report says that Iraqi chemical weapons plants are capable
of producing from 1,400 to 2,500 tons of lethal agents per year.
Iraq's stockpile trails only those maintained by the Soviet Union
and the United States, the report said.
   The document was based on previously published articles,
anonymous sources and two previously unpublished confidential
reports of the West German government regarding arms sales to Iraq
and Libya, Hier said.

<TEXT>
   A small, homemade bomb exploded
early today at a rear gate to the U.S. ambassador's residence,
causing minor damage and no injuries, police and an embassy
spokesman said.
   Ambassador William Swing was home when the explosion occurred at
1 a.m., said Larry Schwartz of the U.S. Information Service. No
group claimed responsibility, he said.
   ``It's a total surprise,'' Schwartz said. ``It's never happened
before.''
   He said the device was near a rear gate that can be approached
from the road. The gate is outside a wall around the residence in
the exclusive Waterkloof Ridge area of Pretoria.
   The U.S. Embassy is in downtown Pretoria.
   Schwartz said there was slight damage to the gate.
   Police said a gate post and guardhouse were damaged, and that
flying debris broke a window in a house across the street.
   The incident came nine days after President F.W. de Klerk met
President Bush in Washington. Right-wing whites were upset by de
Klerk's statement in the United States, where he said apartheid
would be dismantled and South African blacks, presently
disenfranchised, would be given equal voting rights.
   Right-wing whites, who favor strict apartheid, also are angry
with the United States for the limited sanctions it has imposed on
South Africa to protest apartheid.

   Yugoslavia today appealed to its two
biggest ethnic groups to end a conflict that is undermining the
country's stability. Two policemen were reported wounded in a
showdown with Serbian militants.
   Yugoslav leaders ordered Serbian militants in the republic of
Croatia to remove barricades, disband, and return automatic weapons
seized from police armories last week.
   The nation's leaders also demanded the Croatian republic
withdraw special riot police from Serbian-dominated areas of
Croatia, one of six Yugoslav republics.
   The Serbian minority proclaimed autonomy within the republic
Monday, and its barricades have stopped road and rail traffic in
Croatia's eastern sections.
   ``The situation in many areas with mixed national population has
seriously deteriorated,'' a statement by Yugoslavia's collective
presidency said today, adding there are threats of ``nationalist
conflicts with tragic consequences.''
   Serbia is Yugoslavia's largest republic, and Croatia is the
second-largest. The traditional conflict between the two republics
has been exacerbated since a center-right coalition defeated the
Communists in Croatia and took control of the republic earlier this
year.
   Serbs, who make up 500,000 of Croatia's 5 million people, charge
the new government is discriminatory. Croatian authorities charge
the Communist government of Serbia is whipping up ethnic tensions
to destabilize Croatia.
   The Yugoslav presidency also ordered Croatia to release
``illegally detained Serbs.'' At least 27 people have been arrested
since the arms were taken. Three Croatian policeman have been
wounded in clashes with Serbian protesters since Friday.
   Two were wounded Tuesday at a roadblock near Knin, a
Serbian-dominated city of 10,000 in Croatia. The official Yugoslav
news agency Tanjug reported today that the two were stopped by
Serbian militants at a roadblock and ordered to surrender their
weapons.
   The police refused and tried to leave, but the militants fired
on them, wounding them slightly, Tanjug said.
   On Friday, a Croatian policeman was wounded in clashes with
Serbian protesters in Petrinja, another city south of the Croatian
capital, Zagreb.
   On Tuesday, Yugoslav leaders blocked the move for a
self-sufficient defense force in another republic, Slovenia, and
ordered the federal army to remain in the defiant region.
   The presidency said the nation's stability was treatened by the
constitutional amendment passed Friday by the Slovenian Parliament
saying the republic was solely responsible for its defense.
   Traditional animosities and political rivalries between
republics with democratically elected governments and Communists
are pulling the federation apart along ideological and ethnic
lines. Slovenia also ousted its Communist leadership in an election
earlier this year.
   Slovenia and Croatia want the nation changed into a loose
confederation of sovereign states. The two groups have had ethnic
disputes dating from Yugoslavia's birth in 1918.
   Yugolavia's collective presidency, made up of representatives
from each of the country's six republics and two provinces, is
formally the highest body in the land. It is also in charge of the
armed forces.

<HEAD>Blacks Most Affected by Increase in Asthma Deaths</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asthma deaths, once declining, have made ``an
alarming reversal'' and have risen steadily in the United States
with blacks and the poor among those most affected, researchers
say.
   ``The message we got ... was very clear. (Asthma deaths) are
going up, and they're going up for the youngest of children,'' said
Dr. Kevin Weiss, the lead researcher in a study reported in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The researchers also found that the Chicago metropolitan area
and New York City were leading the deadly trend.
   Because of asthma's growing severity in inner cities, Weiss
said, the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases
soon will announce a major study aimed at understanding the
disease's severity in urban areas.
   Researchers could not fully explain the increased death rates.
   The suspicions are that it's a combination of lower access to
medical treatment and a worse environment in urban areas, Weiss
said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
   Weiss, who works at George Washington University Medical Center
and the National Institutes of Health, and co-author Dr. Diane K.
Wagener of the National Center for Health Statistics wrote that
previous research tended to blame the increase largely on
diagnostic changes. But they said that explanation alone doesn't
suffice.
   Asthma, which afflicts an estimated 9.9 million people in the
United States, ``affects children, blacks and the poor
disproportionately,'' the researchers wrote.
   ``For example, asthma hospitalization rates and mortality are
more than twice as high among blacks as whites,'' they reported.
   The researchers noted that from 1968 almost through the 1970s,
the nation's asthma mortality rates declined. Yet, they wrote:
``Since the late 1970s, there has been an alarming reversal. It
seems that rates are increasing faster among younger children, aged
5 to 14 years, than among adolescents and young adults, aged 15 to
34 years.''
   An accompanying editorial called the findings ``worrisome
because they come at a time when morbidity and mortality from many
chronic diseases are decreasing, when we think we have a fairly
sound understanding'' of asthma, ``and when we believe we have more
effective drugs for its management.''
   The asthma death study examined government data on deaths of
5-to 34-year-olds from 1968 through 1987 in all 48 states except
Hawaii and Alaska and in the District of Columbia.
   Asthma deaths rose steadily from 1978 through 1987, the most
recent year data were available. The 1987 rate was 4.2 per million
population, while the 1968 level was 4.0 per million.
   The highest mortality rate in 1987 was among non-white males -
13.5 deaths per million and almost five times higher than the level
for whites of both sexes.
   When combined, New York City and the six-county Chicago
metropolitan area accounted for 21.1 percent of the asthma deaths
studied, suggesting those areas ``are driving the U.S. trend'' in
rising asthma mortality, the researchers wrote.
   ``We don't know why,'' Weiss said. ``All we can say now is, we
finally found a place where we can do some deep, in-depth
studies.''
   Dr. Frank Speizer of Harvard Medical School, who was not
involved in the studies, blamed the increased hospitalizations of
blacks on ``the inadequacy of our health-care system.''
   But Speizer, who is researching respiratory diseases, said the
trend might speak well of doctors who now better realize that
asthma patients often need hospitalization.

   It won't fit in a doctor's bag but the lowly
household toilet plunger has proved its medical mettle.
   A doctor says a San Francisco heart patient was revived twice by
family members who reached for the plumber's helper.
   Dr. Keith G. Lurie of the University of California-San Francisco
Medical Center related the incidents in a letter in today's Journal
of the American Medical Association.
   He said a 65-year-old man with severe heart disease collapsed
while watching television one evening. His son, poorly trained in
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, tried unsuccessfully to revive the
man by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and chest compression.
   Lurie said the son then remembered that his mother had
resuscitated her husband six months earlier with a toilet plunger.
So the son got the plunger and used it to plunge his father's chest
for 10 minutes until paramedics arrived.
   By that time, the patient had begun to move and breathe on his
own, Lurie said.
   The doctor speculated that the plunger delivered a ``precordial
thump,'' just as medical experts would have, and served as an
effective chest compressor.
   Lurie said the plunging also may have helped draw air into the
patient's lungs.
   He said the son suggested that toilet plungers be placed next to
all beds in the hospital's coronary care unit.
   ``We recommended that he take a basic CPR course but had to
admit it's hard to argue with success,'' Lurie wrote.

   World leaders today showered congratulations on
the new Germany. But in Europe, the continent with a giant new
power and also long memories, signs of anxiety tinged the historic
day.
   ``We face the future as friends, allies and partners,'' Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher said in a message today to Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of Germany.
   But she said in a British television interview this week,
``Germany will be very dominant in Europe, so it will be up to the
rest of us not to allow it to dominate. Others of us have powerful
voices.''
   Many European newspapers referred today to World War II and some
included German words from the Nazi cry of the 30s: ``Ein Volk, Ein
Reich, Ein Fuhrer - one people, one state, one leader.''
   But others focused on the realization of a dream - what
Norwegian Foreign Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik called ``the end of
the postwar division of Europe.''
   Japan and other Asian countries welcomed German unification,
which Japanese Emperor Akihito called ``a historic turning point in
ushering in the new world.''
   In New York, U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, ending
a 35-nation meeting Tuesday on European cooperation and security,
declared: ``A new era is beginning for Germany, for Europe, and
indeed we hope for the world.''
   From Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent Kohl
congratulations Tuesday. He paid tribute ``to all those in my
country and in your country who ... did not yield to prejudice and
fears, but persistently worked for the future, making this peaceful
and worthy solution of the `German issue' possible.''
   And President Francois Mitterrand of France, who like Mrs.
Thatcher has reservations about German dominance, told Kohl: ``We
have come a long way together. We are going to continue ... Tell
those close to you, tell all Germans of the solidarity of France.''
   Even the world's current pariah, Iraq, weighed in with a message
to the ``friendly Germany people.''
   The Foreign Ministry in Baghdad said Germany's postwar division
was ``to serve the strategies and selfish interests of the major
powers,'' the official Iraqi news agency reported.
   Germany's top diplomat in Israel, Heimo Richter, laid a wreath
today in memory of the 6 million Jews slain in the Holocaust and
assured Israel that his reunited country would never reject
responsibility for its Nazi past.
   Everywhere, television coverage of Germans celebrating into the
early hours and singing their national anthem dominated news
bulletins, while newspapers heralded the rebirth of the nation with
banner headlines.
   European editorial comment laced memories of the Nazi
devastation of Europe in World War II with unease about the speed
of unification and relief that Germany is anchored firmly in NATO
and the 12-nation European Community.
   ``The emergence of a fat, self-centered Germany, free from the
military threat from the East, is a more potent danger than that of
the lean and angry nation of the Thirties,'' London's conservative
Daily Telegraph said in an editorial.
   In France, the leftist daily Liberation said, ``Germany united
is the victory of European reason.'' But it added, ``On Oct. 3,
1990, forgetting is forbidden ... Neither the memory of Auschwitz
nor that of democratic and peaceful unification should be hidden
away.''
   In Italy, the conservative Milan daily Il Giornale, headlined
its editorial ``Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Kohl.''
   In the Netherlands, the liberal De Volkskrant, an Amsterdam
daily, wrote that ``it would be counterproductive to the further
development of Europe already to begin treating Germany with
suspicion.''
   Others dismissed completely the fears of German dominance. ``If
anything, the immediate danger is the opposite one: of a Germany
gazing obsessively at its own navel,'' commented London's respected
Financial Times.
   European royalty sent congratulations. ``I know that the British
people rejoice with you,'' said Queen Elizabeth II.
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek said in a radio
interview today that ``Germany will have to play a major role in
ensuring ... security on the entire European continent.''
   President Mario Soares of Portugal said: ``I have no fear ...
because it (unification) is made under the aegis of democracy ...
and democratic countries are not aggressive.''

   NASA began the countdown today for
this weekend's launch of Discovery on a mission officials hope will
get the shuttle program back in motion and help restore the space
agency's credibility.
   The shuttle is scheduled to lift off at 7:35 a.m. EDT Saturday
with five astronauts and the plutonium-powered Ulysses probe, which
will explore the sun.
   The countdown clock started ticking at 3:30 a.m.
   ``We're looking very smooth at this point,'' NASA test director
Terry Willingham said several hours after the countdown began.
``Everybody's looking forward to a good launch. It's been a long,
dry spell.''
   NASA has not launched a shuttle since April because of dangerous
hydrogen leaks afflicting Columbia and Atlantis. Discovery is the
only shuttle in which hydrogen leaks have not been found and is
also the last shuttle to have flown.
   Discovery's cargo on that last flight - the Hubble Space
Telescope - proved a public relations disaster for NASA. It was not
until after the $1.5 billion telescope was in orbit that officials
learned its primary mirror was flawed.
   Sending Discovery up and safely deploying Ulysses ``will be a
boost for morale and a boost for NASA,'' said NASA project manager
Willis Meeks.
   A generator containing 23.7 pounds of plutonium-238 was
installed Tuesday in the probe, tucked inside Discovery's cargo
bay. Ulysses will use electricity generated from the decaying
plutonium during its five-year journey in space.
   While hooking up the generator, a worker accidentally sheared
off the head of one of four bolts on a small mechanical device used
to shift the generator to full power in space. Engineers decided
three bolts were enough to secure the device, Willingham said.
   It will be the second time a shuttle has transported plutonium.
The Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft contained twice as much when
it was carried aloft by Atlantis last October.
   An Energy Department team of nearly 100 people will be on hand
to monitor radiation in case an accident.
   Activists afraid a Challenger-like accident would scatter the
deadly plutonium over Florida and result in untold cancer
fatalities asked a judge on Tuesday to halt the launch.
   A hearing is scheduled for Thursday in Washington before U.S.
District Judge Oliver Gasch, who refused to stop last year's launch
with plutonium.
   The activists said NASA is downplaying the threat of cancer and
that the space agency's inability to fix Columbia's hydrogen leaks
calls into question its competency.
   NASA replied in court papers that it conducts ``an elaborate and
exhaustive safety review'' before a flight. Space agency officials
insist the chance of a plutonium release is extremely small and
would pose little health risk.
   NASA tried four times in four months to launch Columbia before
stopping two weeks ago to turn its attention to Discovery, which
must lift off by Oct. 23 or wait 13 months for the planets to be in
the right alignment again.
   Ulysses will speed toward Jupiter and use the planet's gravity
to be whipped into orbit around the sun. The probe will explore the
sun's poles in 1994 and 1995.
   The mission is a joint effort of NASA and the European Space
Agency, which supplied the $250 million satellite. NASA's share,
estimated at $500 million, covers the launch and mission.

<HEAD>Malawi Accused of Massacre of 20</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>

   A human rights group, describing Malawi as
despotic and brutally repressive, said today that police there
killed more than 20 protesters in a previously unreported massacre.
   The shootings occurred March 18 in Lilongwe, the southern
African country's main city, according to the New York-based group
Africa Watch.
   Police fired on stone-throwing demonstrators angry at the
authorities' failure to prosecute a businessman who killed one of
his employees accused of theft, according to Africa Watch.
   ``More than 20 protesters'' were killed, including passers-by,
and many were injured, said the group. It was not immediately
possible to get confirmation of the incident from sources in
Malawi.
   Africa Watch detailed the deaths in a 116-page report entitled
``Where Silence Rules: The Suppression of Dissent in Malawi.'' The
report, scheduled for publication Oct. 10, was obtained today by
The Associated Press.
   The report examines what Africa Watch describes as a quarter
century of human rights abuses under president-for-life Kamuzu
Hastings Banda. It accuses Western governments of ignoring the
situation ``for the sake of their own interests in Malawi.''
   Malawi has been widely considered a stable Western ally, but
Africa Watch said that ``stability has been bought at a terrible
cost of human lives snuffed out or forced to endure years of
detention without trial.''
   ``But whereas totalitarian Eastern Bloc regimes received regular
denunciation for human rights abuses, Banda's Malawi receives
Western aid,'' Africa Watch said.
   Africa Watch claims part of the reason for the West's tolerance
of Malawi's government under Banda - who has ruled the small, hilly
nation since 1964 - is because of ``generally good treatment'' of
hundreds of thousands of Mozambican refugees who have fled there in
recent years.
   The report lists Banda's idiosyncracies and eccentricities.
   Under Banda, Malawi has instituted laws that impose prison
sentences on men who wear their hair over their collar or wear
flared trousers, and on women who wear skirts shorter than
knee-length or pants. Banda, who is estimated to be in his 90s,
favors three-piece suits and homburg hats.
   ``Unfortunately, these eccentricities have often made Banda look
like a mere comic opera autocrat and masked the deadly seriousness
of his repressive rule,'' said Africa Watch.
   It accuses his government of regularly arresting people it
considers a threat under security laws that allow them to be held
without trial indefinitely. Among those detained are the nation's
leading poet, Jack Mapanje, and the nation's sole neurosurgeon.
   Under Banda, Africa Watch said, a leading economist and a
prominent journalist, three Cabinet members, a minister of
Parliament and members of the Jehovah's Witnesses faith have been
assassinated.
   It said political prisoners regularly are beaten, but criminal
prisoners often die after being stripped naked, chained to the
floor and denied food or given reduced rations.
   Africa Watch called on Western nations to pressure Malawi to end
its human rights abuses by tying future military or economic aid to
the improvement of its human rights record.

   The Temple University campus returned to
normal today as professors obeyed a judge's back-to-work order and
ended a four-week strike that delayed hundreds of the school's fall
semester classes.
   ``I'm glad they decided to go back,'' said senior English major
Victoria Mason, 28, of Hightstown, N.J. ``I came here to learn and
I haven't had any classes since I got here until today.''
   The 1,100-member faculty union walked out over pay and health
benefits at the private university. It was the longest walkout in
Temple history.
   The sharply divided union voted Tuesday night to go to work
while appealing the order issued earlier in the day by Common Pleas
Judge Samuel Lehrer.
   Ms. Mason was one of 6,000 students who had all her classes
delayed by the strike. An additional 23,000 students, out of the
enrollment of 30,000, had at least one class delayed.
   The fall semester at Temple had 4,700 classes on the schedule;
about 1,900 were held up until today.
   At 8 a.m., the campus was quiet. The pickets who had been
present since Sept. 4, the first day of the semester, were gone. As
it got closer to 9 a.m., when classes began, activity began to
build.
   ``It's looking like a real campus again,'' said Temple spokesman
George Ingram. ``I think everybody's glad that we're back to normal
at least for now.''
   Not all were completely happy, however, even though the
professors decided to obey the court order.
   ``We're going back and going to work under the duress of the
injunction,'' Jerome Levinthal, a professor of education, said
Tuesday. ``What we should be getting is an adequate negotiated
settlement.''
   Lehrer ruled a back-to-work order was needed for ``promoting,
safeguarding and nurturing our most precious commodity -
education.''
   Professors leaving the meeting said the secret-ballot vote by
the union, which also represents librarians and other professors,
was 200 to 199.
   ``The members decided they did not want to taint our strike with
an issue of legality,'' said union president Arthur Hochner.
   Temple had said that if the professors didn't report, it would
cancel 1,900 of its 4,700 classes that haven't met since the strike
began.
   ``The important thing is that we'll be coming back to class and
this long period of disruption for our students has ended,'' said
Temple spokeswoman Kathy Gosliner.
   Ms. Gosliner said 1,757 students have withdrawn from the
university since the strike began, compared with 818 during the
same period last year.
   Temple President Peter J. Liacouras said the strike has cost the
university $6.3 million, including $4 million lost in tuition.
   ``I'm interested in going back to the classroom,'' said Tony
Ranere, an anthropology professor. ``If we can save the semester
for the students, we should.''
   The strike prompted student sit-ins in the president's office
and on busy intersections in the heart of the urban campus.
   The judge also ordered the resumption of contract talks, which
broke off after dawn Tuesday. No new talks have been scheduled.

<HEAD>Police Files Attempted Murder Charges Against Two U.S. Marines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police filed attempted murder charges
today against two U.S. Marines whose military vehicle hit a
barricade set up by strikers at the U.S. Clark Air Base and
slightly injured one worker.
   A police officer said on condition of anonymity that Marine Sgt.
David Akers and Cpl. Gary Motler also were charged with disrupting
a peaceful meeting. The hometowns of the two were not immediately
available.
   The charges were filed with the government prosecutors office
which, with sufficient evidence, could elevate the case to a trial
court. The officer did not say what sentences the Marines could
received if they are convicted.
   Clark authorities said they were unaware of the charges and
refused comment.
   On Tuesday, eight U.S. Marine vehicles and their Philippine air
force jeep escort were passing through the gate when the second
vehicle in the convoy accidentally hit a wooden barricade.
   Pieces of the barricade hit a striker, one of several dozen
picketers guarding a gate at Clark, bruising him in the back, Clark
spokesmen and police said. Clark is in Pampanga province, 50 miles
north of Manila.
   U.S. military authorities said the incident was an accident and
apologized.
   But union officials called it a provocation of Filipino workers
whose strike began Sunday at Clark and five other U.S. facilities
over wage increases. The strikers claim the United States has
violated a bilateral agreement covering Filipino employees that
forsees salary increases based on a survey of 35 Philippine firms.
   The U.S. Congress has placed a 3 percent cap on pay increases
for federal employees, including those oversees, but the recent
wage survey suggested an 18 percent increase.
   The third day of negotiations between the 22,000-strong strikers
union and U.S. military authorities ended today without any
agreement. Another meeting was set for Thursday in Manila.
   The United States maintains the six military installations under
an agreement that is due to expire in September 1991.

<HEAD>Bhutto Promises Revenge Against President</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
said today that if she wins the election later this month, she will
fight to remove Pakistan's president, who two months ago ousted her
government.
   A spokesman for the army-backed caretaker government accused
Bhutto of trying to create chaos and instability and force
cancellation of the Oct. 24 parliamentary election.
   Ms. Bhutto's 20-month-old, elected government was dismissed Aug.
6 by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan on charges of corruption and abuse
of power.
   She now faces trial before a special one-judge tribunal in
Lahore and her hometown of Karachi on four charges of misconduct
and abuse of power.
   She had been scheduled to appear before the Lahore tribunal on
Tuesday but the proceedings were canceled when hundreds of
emotionally charged supporters stormed and ransacked the courtroom.
After two hours of pandemonium that left dozens of people injured,
the hearing was postponed until Oct. 9.
   Ms. Bhutto, speaking at a news conference today, claimed that at
least 250 plainclothes police commandos infiltrated the crowd of
about 5,000 supporters and stirred up the trouble.
   ``I felt I was suffocating. I felt as if I was blacking out. I
raised my head for a gasp of air and smelled gas,'' she said.
   Riot police armed with automatic rifles and steel-tipped batons,
however, used no force against the crowd and did not fire tear gas.
   During the past month the 37-year-old former prime minister has
launched almost daily verbal attacks on Ishaq Khan, a 73-year-old
career bureaucrat who rose to the presidency in August 1988 after a
decade of military rule ended.
   ``Her remarks are a reflection of a state of panic. She
obviously wants to run away from the elections and to plunge the
country into chaos and instability,'' the spokesman for the
caretaker government said on condition of anonymity.
   Ms. Bhutto accused the president of lying to her, saying he
twice denied Aug. 6 that he would dismiss her administration.
``People have a sense of anger and outrage at what has been done,''
she said.
   She predicted that her left-leaning Pakistan People's Party
would emerge victorious in the election. She said that if she wins,
the president would be compelled resign or she would fight him
politically and judicially.
   ``I am not living with him and the people are not living with
him. He has to go. This mockery has to end,'' she said.
   Pakistan's president is elected for a five-year term by the
National Assembly, the law-making lower house of Parliament and the
four provincial assemblies.
   According to the Constitution, the president can only be removed
by impeachment by two-thirds majority of the National Assembly and
the Senate, the upper house of Parliament.
   Most Pakistanis, including some of Ms. Bhutto's most ardent
supporters, doubt that her party will win an outright majority in
the assembly; the Senate is overwhelmingly controlled by her
opponents.

   A construction company president was acquitted of
negligence in the death of an employee, but federal prosecutors
said their effort to get tough with employers about workplace
safety would continue.
   Michael N. Pandelena, president of the now-defunct Mill Road
Contractors Inc., was found innocent Tuesday by a U.S. District
Court jury. It was the first prosecution under a federal pilot
program that began this week in New England to go after workplace
safety violations.
   After a two-day trial, the jury decided Pandelena should not be
held criminally responsible for the electrocution of John Nixon, a
worker at a North Andover construction site in 1985.
   Nixon, 23, was killed when he grabbed a chain connected to a
backhoe that Pandelena drove too close to an electric line.
   Pandelena, charged with willful negligence, would have faced up
to six months in federal prison and a $250,000 fine if he had been
convicted. Defense attorneys argued that the death was accidental.
   John Miles, regional director of the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, said an experimental program that started on
the same day as the trial will allow his office to more ssult in civil,
not criminal, charges.
In order to convict employers of a crime, prosecutors have to prove
they willfully violated safety regulations.
   ``It's very unusual for the case to even have been brought,''
said Kinney. ``Clearly, it's very difficult to prove these cases
because the willful standard is hard to get around.''

   Germany's leaders today marked the historic
unification of their mighty new country by assuring the world they
will work for peace and never forget their responsibility for the
Nazi Holocaust.
   Random violence in nearly a dozen cities marred the unification
celebrations overnight. About 15,000 leftists protesting the merger
rallied this afternoon in Berlin's working-class district of
Kreuzberg, and numerous shouting matches with police broke out.
   The country was less than 12 hours old before the assurances of
peace came from Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Richard von
Weizsaecker.
   Kohl's message was sent to all governments of the world today, a
spokesman in Bonn said. Von Weizsaecker, addressing a formal
unification ceremony in Berlin, spoke of the ``historic
responsibility'' stemming from the Holocaust.
   The statements were meant to calm world fears about the new
Germany with 78 million people in the center of Europe. Despite
repeated German denials, many Europeans fear the new country will
supplant the Soviet Union as a superpower and dominate the
continent.
   ``Our country, with its regained national unity, will work for
peace in the world and promote European unity,'' Kohl's message
said.
   ``At the same time, we stand by our moral and legal
responsibilities that arise from German history,'' Kohl added. That
was a reference to the Nazi past and the Holocaust, which claimed
the lives of 6 million Jews.
   At a formal state ceremony in the Berlin Philharmonic Hall, von
Weizsaecker said: ``The Nazi terror and the war it caused inflicted
untold serious injustice and suffering on almost all of Europe and
on us. We continuously recall the victims.
   ``No one among us will forget that there never would have been a
separation without the war started by Germany under Hitler,'' von
Weizsaecker told several hundred invited guests. He also called for
peace and European unity.
   The unification came 11 months after the Berlin Wall fell in a
peaceful revolt that cast aside Communist East German overlords.
   At midnight Tuesday, before Berlin's battle-scarred Reichstag,
an estimated 1 million Germans from all walks of life joined in an
emotional chorus of the national anthem to usher in the birth of
their nation.
   Germany's imperialist past was recalled by the Reichstag, the
old parliament building heavily damaged in the last days of World
War II. On Thursday, it will again be host to German lawmakers.
   Many standing before the Reichstag had tears in their eyes
during the main celebrations.
   ``What for many was only a dream is now becoming reality,'' said
de Maiziere, the soft-spoken musician who led East Germany through
its short democratic life as prime minister.
   Dozens held aloft torches that shimmered in the dark.
   As the end came for East Germany and the mighty new country took
center stage, Germans were united in thanking Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The former East German leader, Lothar De Maiziere, credited the
Kremlin leader with clearing the way for East Germany's peaceful
revolution by refusing to prop up ``an anti-reform system with the
force of weapons.''
   That revolution, part of the pro-democracy movement that swept
Eastern Europe last year, set off the sprint to full unification.
   Kohl praised Gorbachev and also thanked the Western allies for
their support.
   Despite the relief and joy over unification, Germans face what
Kohl called a ``a difficult path'' in combining the strong West
German economy with the collapsing economy of East Germany.
   Businesses in what was East Germany are failing daily, with
predictions of up to 4 million people out of work. The former West
Germans are showing greater irritation with their poor cousins from
the East.
   Not all Germans were pleased by unity, however.
   In Berlin, police said about 50 people were arrested for
fighting or other infractions overnight.
   About 70 right-wing extremists in Magdeburg, 60 miles west of
Berlin, stoned cars and attacked passers-by with baseball bats.
Earlier, leftist radicals rampaged in a club for young people
there, injuring several guests.
   In Schwerin, a former East German city, several hundred leftists
and rightists clashed after the rightists celebrated unification
with the Nazi salute.
   Several dozen rightist extremists rampaged through Leipzig,
attacking police with bottles, stones and firecrackers, the news
agency ADN reported.
   Police in Goettingen, 70 miles south of Hanover, said 1,000
leftist protesters opposed to unification had rampaged through the
city.
   Authorities said the radicals broke store windows and chanted
``Never Again Germany'' and ``Nazis out.''
   In Hamburg, drunken young people clashed with police, and
several were arrested. Munich police said 2,000 demonstrators
rushed into a central square at midnight, some of handing out
right-wing extremist magazines.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Adviser Heads to Iraq on Middle East Mission</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A close adviser to Mikhail S. Gorbachev headed for Iraq today on
a special Middle East mission, leaving just hours after Secretary
of State James A. Baker III said there was growing world support
for a military strike against Iraq.
   President Francois Mitterrand also flew to the region today. He
will visit the French frigate Dupleix on Thursday, then travel to
Saudi Arabia for talks with King Fahd and to inspect French forces
at the Red Sea port of aanbu.
   Meanwhile, Iraq freed nine Frenchmen taken hostage in the
standoff caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Several
thousand Westerners are being held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait, some
as shields against a possible attack.
   The French nationals arrived in Jordan on a regularly scheduled
Iraqi Airways flight from Baghdad and were to be flown to France
later today.
   A leading Spanish human rights activist and legislator left
Spain for Baghdad today to try to secure the release of 20
Spaniards held by Iraq.
   Mitterrand offered in a speech last week to link an Iraqi
pullout from Kuwait to a broader Middle East settlement. In a
speech Sunday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein suggested France as a
possible negotiating partner.
   Also in the Middle East today was Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
of Japan. He was to meet Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassin
Ramadan in Amman, Jordan, Thursday, the Japanese Foreign Ministry
said in Tokyo.
   Kaifu arrived in Amman on the second leg of a five-nation tour
in the Middle East. He visited Egypt on Tuesday. Kaifu is also
scheduled to tour Saudi Arabia and Oman before returning home
Tuesday.
   The Soviet news agency Tass announced the departure of Yevgeny
Primakov, former head of the leading Soviet think tank on Middle
East issues.
   It said he would visit Baghdad en route to Amman, Jordan, where
he would meet with King Hussein and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Tass said Primakov was ``on a special mission'' on behalf of the
Soviet president but did not elaborate. It also did not say with
whom Primakov would meet in Baghdad.
   The Soviets have joined the United States in demanding that
Saddam pull his troops out of Kuwait, although they have urged that
no military action be taken against Iraq without U.N.
authorization.
   On Tuesday, the Soviet military chief of staff reiterated that
position during a trip to New York. Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev said
current sanctions are working and that Saddam is ``in economic and
political isolation and he can't survive very long that way.''
   It appeared, however, that Iraq had no intention of budging in
the 2-month-old Persian Gulf crisis.
   U.S. military sources in Saudi Arabia said Baghdad has
strengthened its forces in southern Iraq and Kuwait and has now
deployed nearly half its 1 million-man army to defend the occupied
territory.
   About 170,000 U.S. troops are leading a multinational force
arrayed against Saddam across the border in Saudi Arabia and on
ships in the region.
   There have been reports from occupied Kuwait of atrocities by
Iraqi soldiers, of people accused of belonging to the resistance
being executed and of sympathizers having their homes burned down.
   Today, Amnesty International issued a report saying that Iraqi
troops in Kuwait have tortured and executed scores of people, some
for refusing to display pictures of Saddam. The London-based
international human rights group said the report was based on
information gathered by two representatives who interviewed
witnesses and victims in Bahrain.
   The European Community announced Tuesday that it will provide
$1.5 billion in aid to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey as compensation for
economic hardships they are suffering because of the crisis.
   Turkey lost substantial revenue with the shutdown of an Iraqi
oil pipeline through its territory; Jordan is burdened by an influx
of refugees; and Egypt with the cost of keeping troops in Saudi
Arabia to deter an Iraqi attack.
   All three say they are honoring the U.N. embargo on trade with
Iraq.
   But Cyprus has said it arrested three members of a tanker crew
on suspicion of trying to ship Iraqi oil to Lebanon. The
Honduran-flag tanker, Fiona, owned by a Lebanese company, loaded
13,000 barrels of oil on Aug. 24 at Turkey's southern port of Dort
Yol, Cypriot authorities said Tuesday.
   That is the Mediterranean terminal of an Iraqi oil pipeline
runing across Turkey. Ankara said it had closed the pipeline soon
after the U.N. embargo was announced. The ship arrived in Lanarca
Sept. 24 after trying and failing to deliver oil to the Christian
Lebanese port of Jounieh.
   In New York on Tuesday, Baker told a news conference that he had
found a greater willingness to consider military action against
Iraq ``if it became necessary at an appropriate time.''
   But he said sentiments could change quickly, and emphasized that
the Bush administration preferred a diplomatic solution.
   Baker has spent the past week in New York consulting with
diplomats attending the annual U.N. General Assembly session.
   In a speech to the assembly on Monday, President Bush sounded a
conciliatory note by suggesting that an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait
could be linked to an overall Middle East peace settlement that
would consider the demands of Palestinians for a separate homeland.
   Tass quoted Primakov as saying in a newspaper interview that the
Persian Gulf crisis was ``a kind of laboratory, testing our efforts
to create a new world after the end of the Cold War.''
   In the interview with the weekly Literary Gazette, he said:
   ``These efforts should definitely take account of the
impossibility of imposing one's will on other nations and the right
of any people to freely choose its own path of development and
state system.''
   In Los Angeles, the Simon Wiesenthal Center said Iraq built its
extensive arsenal of chemical and biological weapons with the aid
of more than 200 Western companies, including more than a dozen in
the United States.

<TEXT>
   Stefano Casiraghi, the 30-year-old
husband of Princess Caroline, was killed today when he flipped his
speedboat while defending his title in a world championship race,
the Royal Palace said.
   Caroline, 33, was in Paris when she learned of the death of
Italian financier husband. She quickly left for Monaco, wearing
black mourning clothes. It was the second tragedy to strike the
Grimaldi family in eight years - Caroline's mother, Princess Grace,
died after a car crash in 1982.
   Witnesses said Casiraghi and co-pilot Patrice Innocenti drove
their catamaran, the Pinot di Pinot, straight into a wave at 93 mph
during a morning run for the World Offshore Championships.
   The 42-foot boat flipped over, ejecting Innocenti. But witnesses
said Casiraghi remained strapped to his seat and bore the full
impact of the vessel slamming into the water.
   The two-engine, five-ton boat sank with Casaraghi aboard,
witnesses said.
   ``He surely didn't have time to look out and, at that speed,
stuck under the boat, must have been killed by the blow,'' said
another competitor, Michel Karsten.
   Emergency crews pulled both men from the water and rushed them
to Princess Grace Hospital.
   The hospital said Innocenti, the boat's driver, was being
treated for his injuries.
   Weather conditions off Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, between Monaco and
Nice, were described as normal. The accident came 30 minutes after
the second stage of the race opened today. Organizers canceled the
day's events but did not say when or if they would be rescheduled.
   Today's accident is the worst blow to Monaco's ruling family
since Princess Grace, the American actress who gave up Hollywood to
marry Prince Rainier III, died in 1982. Caroline's younger sister,
Princess Stephanie, also was injured in the car crash.
   Caroline married Casiraghi in a civil ceremony Dec. 29, 1983
under a portrait of her mother. The marriage followed an unhappy
two-year union with French playboy Philippe Junot.
   Caroline and Casiraghi had three children: a son Andrea, 6;
Charlotte, 4; and Pierre, 3.
   Caroline married the tall, blond Casiraghi after divorcing Junot
but without obtaining a Roman Catholic Church annulment of the
marriage.
   She said she married again because she was in love and knew an
annulment - first sought in 1981 - would take a long time.
   ``I wanted a real home and children,'' she was quoted as saying.
``It was difficult for my conscience, but I was overwhelmed by the
desire to have children. Surely that can be understood from a
Christian point of view.''
   The relatively low-profile lifestyle Caroline had enjoyed since
marrying Casiraghi contrasted sharply with the weekly splash she
made in celebrity magazines during the 1970s.
   The couple were reported to have a close relationship and
divided their time between Monaco and Casiraghi's home outside
Milan, Italy.
   The fun-loving but steady Casiraghi ran a successful real estate
firm in Milan as well as a retail export business. His father made
his fortune in heating and air conditioning equipment.
   Casiraghi studied economics at the University of Bocconi in
Milan but dropped out before getting his degree.
   The financier had a passion for offshore racing. Competing since
1984, he won 12 of 80 races, including last year's world
championship held off Atlantic City, N.J.
   The Grimaldi family has ruled Monaco since the 13th century.
   The area is about the size of New York City's Central Park.
Rainier and Grace had three children - Caroline, Prince Albert and
Stephanie. Only Caroline has married and had children.

   After years of arming opposite sides in
Angola's civil war, the United States and the Soviet Union may send
peacekeeping forces to that country once a cease-fire is reached,
the leader of Angola's rebel forces says.
   But a State Department official said today he sees virtually no
possibility that American forces will be sent to Angola on such a
mission.
   Jonas Savimbi, head of the U.S.-backed UNITA rebel group, said
Tuesday after a meeting with President Bush that Bush sees the idea
as a ``good thing.''
   There was no immediate White House comment on Savimbi's
statement. Last week, Soviet and American representatives were on
hand in Lisbon for the fourth round of peace talks between envoys
of the leftist Angolan government and UNITA.
   A State Department official who was unaware of the discussion at
the White House said Tuesday there was no mention at the Lisbon
talks of Soviet and American forces monitoring an Angolan
cease-fire.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there
was a discussion of U.S. and Soviet participation at the diplomatic
level in overseeing implementation of a cease-fire and a political
settlement.
   Another official confirmed today that U.S. participation almost
certainly would be limited to a diplomatic as opposed to military
role.
   Meeting with reporters outside the White House, Savimbi said
peace talks with the Angolan government are going well.
   ``We think it's just a matter of more rounds of talks and then
we may get there,'' he said. Savimbi said Sunday he believes a
truce can be reached by the end of the year and that free and fair
elections are possible by the end of 1991.
   Savimbi told Bush the Angolan government has been flexible
because of U.S. assistance to UNITA. The president replied that
UNITA can count on U.S. aid until a cease-fire is in place and
there is a date certain for free and fair elections, according to
informed sources who asked not to be identified.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush believes that
continued U.S. support is the key to pushing negotiations to a
successful conclusion.
   ``The president expressed the hope that these negotiations will
lead to peace and national reconciliation in Angola,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Randall Robinson, head of TransAfrica, a liberal lobbying group
that has long opposed Savimbi, told a news conference that aid
should be suspended immediately as a means of hastening a
cease-fire.
   Only with a cease-fire, Robinson said, can food supplies reach
the 2 million Angolans who he said are suffering from hunger.
Angolan authorities agreed two weeks ago to a U.N. plan for
delivering emergency food aid to Angolans who have been affected by
a prolonged drought.
   Robinson also said that, in addition to cutting off aid, Bush
should not even be meeting with Savimbi. He cited recent news
accounts that the rebel leader has run his organization with an
iron fist, dealing ruthlessly with would-be rivals.
   The State Department said Monday that an account critical of
Savimbi's internal rule was based on old allegations which have
never been substantiated.
   Jesse Jackson renewed his criticism of aid to UNITA on Tuesday.
``Savimbi is here for his paycheck,'' Jackson said in a statement.
   He said the policy of aiding UNITA was begun during the Cold
War, which is now over. Nonetheless, U.S. policy has not changed,
Jackson said, adding, ``We need a new Africa policy.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders Teacher To Stop Reading Bible to Fifth-Grade Class</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON WORD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today temporarily
barred a school district from permitting a fifth-grade teacher to
read Bible stories to her pupils.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II gave the order in the form
of a preliminary injunction against the Nassau County School Board
and Martha Mitchell. Moore said he would rule later on whether the
order would be made permanent.
   Mrs. Mitchell reads the Bible each morning to her pupils at Emma
Love Elementary School in Fernandina Beach, a Florida coast town of
7,200 about 25 miles north of here. She argues it is legal because
public schools are allowed to study the Bible as a literary work.
   The injunction was requested by the American Civil Liberties
Union on behalf of Donald and Louise Hatch, whose daughter is one
of Mrs. Mitchell's pupils.
   Pressed by dozens of residents who favor Bible reading in the
schools, the school baord last week voted to allow Mrs. Mitchell to
keep reading it in class. The board took the action against the
advice of its own attorney.
   The 52-year-old Mrs. Mitchell, a Methodist, said she read Bible
stories to her schoolchildren throughout her 30-year career. She
said it quiets them before class - and she never imagined she'd be
violating the Constitution.
   ``Because you were able to teach it the Bible in schools as a
piece of literature, if I didn't make any interpretation on it or
try to smother the children, to me it was not legally wrong,'' she
said.
   The lawsuit alleges that the teacher and school board have
violated the establishment and free exercise clauses of the U.S.
Constitution.
   The Hatches said they have no personal objection to Mrs.
Mitchell or her teaching methods but don't believe their 9-year-old
daughter should be read the Bible in school.
   Robyn Blumner, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, said:
``It is well-settled law that school personnel may not involve
students in religious activities. Tolerance of religious pluralism
is fundamental to a free society.''
   By allowing Bible stories and Bible reading, the school district
is placing its stamp of approval on one set of religious beliefs to
the exclusion of others, she said.
   ``It is simply not the role of the government to indoctrinate
and proselytize - maybe in Iran it is OK, but not in America,'' she
said.
   Moore said he would set a date later for a hearing on a
permanent order sought by the ACLU.

<TEXT>
   California is well prepared to deal with major
earthquakes, but some other quake-vulnerable areas are failing to
come to grips with the threat, a federal emergency official said
today.
   ``Earthquakes are not just a California issue,'' Grant C.
Peterson, associate director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, told reporters as he assessed the lessons of the Loma
Prieta earthquake that struck Northern California including San
Francisco last Oct. 17.
   Peterson said 36 states are vulnerable and 17 have ``major
vulnerability'' to earthquakes.
   He mentioned the Puget Sound area of Washington state, Puerto
Rico, New York City, Boston, Salt Lake City, Denver, Montana and
the seven states that could be affected by an earthquake along the
New Madrid fault that runs from Arkansas to Southern Illinois.
   ``The preparedness between California and other states varies
drastically,'' he said.
   ``California is easily the best prepared state to deal with
earthquake disasters,'' Peterson said. ``In California they have
had good building requirements in their codes for a long time at
the local level for new structures. Some other areas in the United
States haven't even addressed it.
   ``We are trying to sensitize all of the earthquake-prone areas
to their threat,'' the official said.
   The Loma Prieta earthquake, measuring 7.1 in magnitude on the
Richter scale, killed 67 people, left an estimated 1,000 people
homeless and did an estimated $7 billion to $10 billion worth of
damage.
   Peterson said federal expenditures to assist recovery from the
earthquake are expected to total $1.4 billion and will probably
continue for about another three years.
   He said FEMA's experience in the California quake showed a need
for improved urban search and rescue techniques and streamlined
registration procedures for victims.
   He said an 800 telephone number, used for the first time in the
California quake, would be made available to victims in all
disasters from now on.

   President Bush is sounding the death knell for
Reaganomics as he takes his $500 billion deficit-reduction plan to
the nation. Conservative economic philosophy ran ``out of gas'' in
Congress, he complains.
   Bush, who earlier in the week called on Saddam Hussein to ``do a
180'' and pull out of Kuwait, is completing a 180-degree turn of
his own.
   Or maybe it's a 360. It was Bush, after all, who initially
denounced Reagan's advocacy of large tax cuts as ``voodoo
economics.''
   Bush now is headed for the campaign trail to push a budget
deficit package whose most outspoken critics are Republicans.
   The new package has so little support among conservatives, in
fact, that Bush had to take to the airwaves Tuesday night in an
address to the nation largely designed to pick up GOP votes in
Congress.
   Bush's conversion - and embrace of a package that includes $134
billion in new taxes over five years - ends 10 years of supply-side
doctrine from the Oval Office: the argument that any new taxes are
a drag on economic growth.
   If taxes could be kept low enough, the reasoning went, the
entire economy would prosper and grow, generating enough new
business revenue to pull down the federal deficit.
   In 1981, when Reagan and Bush took office, the deficit was $78.9
billion.
   In the fiscal year that ended Sunday, the deficit was $219
billion. This fiscal year, even with the deficit-reduction package
Bush is pushing, it will be an estimated $254 billion.
   ``If we fail to enact this agreement, our economy will falter,
markets may tumble and recession will follow,'' Bush told the
nation in his televised speech Tuesday night from the Oval Office.
   He noted that while ``I'm not, and I know you're not, a fan of
tax increases,'' if there must be new taxes ``everyone who can
should contribute something.''
   Bush was to push the package, worked out with congressional
leaders, in a series of GOP campaign events over the next few
weeks.
   But, with the White House claiming it did not appear to have the
votes in the House to win passage of the package, Bush today
canceled plans to campaign in New England on Thursday and Friday.
   The package's proposal for a new 2-cent-a-gallon tax on heating
oil is particularly unpopular there.
   The New England economy, after being the strongest during the
Reagan years, now is one of the nation's shakiest.
  Of the six New England states, the Democratic governors of
Vermont, Massachusetts and Connecticut all opted not to seek
re-election. And the Republican governors of Maine and Rhode Island
are running behind their Democratic challengers in the polls.
   In comments remarkable for an incumbent president, Bush told a
group of business leaders on Tuesday, ``The philosophy I was
elected on runs out of gas in terms of votes in the United States
Congress.''
   He made the comments by way of apology for giving up, first on
his ``no new taxes'' pledge and then on his vow to seek a lower
capital gains tax.
   He still believes in conservative economic theory, he said, but
he just wasn't able to translate his views into votes.
   ``We've tried hard ... and we've simply failed because the votes
aren't there,'' Bush said.
   Bush was asked at a news conference Monday what his advocacy for
the new budget plan said about such campaign promises as ``no new
taxes'' and a cut in the capital gains tax rate.
   ``It says you need more Republicans, and then we'll do it
exactly my way,'' he responded.
   He told the business leaders Tuesday, ``every once in a while in
one's presidency I think it dawns on the incumbent of the Oval
Office that you're not going to get it exactly your own way.''
   ``I don't want to sound sanctimonious about this, but I was
elected to govern. I was elected to make things happen,'' he added.

   The Supreme Court, wrestling with the
constitutionality of skyrocketing punitive damage awards in
lawsuits, heard sharply conflicting views today in a case of
potentially enormous importance to American consumers and
businesses.
   Bruce J. Ennis Jr., urging the justices to uphold a $1 million
jury award in an Alabama insurance fraud case, said 200 years of
legal history are on his side.
   The jury ``just has to have a rational basis and not be
arbitrary,'' he said. That has been the practice ``throughout the
land for 200 years and it is still the standard in nearly every
state today.''
   But his opponent, Bruce A. Beckman, argued for placing stricter
limits on the discretion of jurors.
   In the Alabama case, Beckman said, ``all the jury had to go on
was its own notions of right and wrong. That is exactly the
arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement (the Constitution)
condemns.''
   Ennis is representing a woman who won the $1 million award;
Beckman is the lawyer for the insurance company.
   The justices peppered both sides with questions, giving few
clues to the outcome of the complex case. It hinges on the
application of the Constitution's due process guarantee,
essentially an assurance of fair play for all.
   Justice Antonin Scalia noted that punitive damage awards have a
long tradition.
   ``Who whispers in my ear it's a violation of due process when
it's been going on since 1791?'' he asked Beckman.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in questioning Ennis, said she is
troubled when juries impose big awards without guidelines.
   Giving juries limitless discretion ``is a very strange notion of
what due process means,'' she said.
   Leading business groups, the American Medical Association and
pharmaceutical industry, religious officials and media giants are
among those urging the court to restrain or outlaw
multimillion-dollar damage awards.
   Their opponents include consumer organizations and important
segments of the nation's legal establishment.
   Scores of groups have inundated the court with stacks of
friend-of-the-court legal briefs, recalling the intense state
legislative lobbying over ``tort reform'' by both sides in recent
years.
   The court is being asked to decide whether awards aimed at
punishing wrongdoers and deterring future misconduct may be so
large in some cases that they are fundamentally unfair. A ruling is
expected in 1991.
   David H. Souter was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday to the
high court but was not hearing the case today because he will not
be sworn in until Oct. 9.
   Business executives say runaway juries, swayed by concern for
injured victims, unfairly punish corporations because of their size
and wealth. But consumer advocates say such uncertainty is the best
protection Americans have against corporate greed.
   In the Alabama case, the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. was
ordered to pay $1,040,000 to Cleopatra Haslip.
   An employee of Roosevelt City, Ala., she discovered her
insurance coverage had lapsed after incurring $3,500 in hospital
and medical bills in 1982 for treatment of a kidney infection.
   The hospital demanded $600 before it would dscharge her; her
doctor turned her case over to a collection agency, and her credit
suffered from her inability to pay bills that amounted to about
half her annual pay.
   Lemmie Ruffin, the insurance agent who arranged health coverage
for Roosevelt City workers, had pocketed the premiums.
   Pacific Mutual said it had not sanctioned nor was even aware of
the agent's misdeeds.
   In its appeal to the high court, the company said the jury based
the damage award on ``moral discretion without adequate standards
as to the amount necessary to punish and deter.'' The company said
its rights were violated because it was held vicariously liable for
Ruffin's wrongdoing.
   The justices last year ruled that huge awards in civil lawsuits
do not violate the Constitution's ban on excessive fines. But they
left open the possibility that awards may be so disproportionate to
actual harm suffered that they violate due process rights.
   The Constitution says states may not deprive anyone of property
without due process of law.
   Those pressing for limits on big-money awards say they squelch
American competitiveness and the inherently risk-filled development
of new products, particularly medical breakthroughs.
   Religious leaders want protection against suits charging clergy
malpractice or indoctrination by out-of-the-mainstream religious
groups.
   Media organizations say enormous libel awards - such as a recent
$31.5 million judgment against the Philadelphia Inquirer - are a
growing threat to free expression.
   Some states have restricted punitive damages, including dollar
limits or stricter standards of proof before a jury can award them.
But in most states, some experts say, the trend toward
multimillion-dollar awards has not been checked.
   The opposing sides disagree about the nature, or even existence,
of a lawsuit crisis.
   Insurance companies and businesses cite studies that show damage
awards have gone through the roof, with the average judgment in the
millions.
   Trial lawyers and consumer groups say the figures are
misleading. They say the six-figure award is rare, with damages in
most cases only a fraction of the highly publicized big awards.
   On Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments over whether
Louisiana officials should be barred from giving a mass murderer
mind-altering drugs to restore his sanity so he can be executed.
   ``It's fundamentally wrong,'' Baton Rouge, La., lawyer Keith
Nordyke argued in behalf of Michael Owen Perry, who was convicted
of killing his parents and five other relatives in 1983.
   ``The medications don't cure Mr. Perry. They may mask his
insanity for a period of time so we can feel better about executing
him,'' Nordyke contended.
   But Rene Salomon, an assistant state attorney general, said the
powerful drugs being given to Perry are beneficial and that
Louisiana has a strong interest in seeing Perry cured.

   Jermund Skogstad took a break from moving
into his new apartment, went out for a bite to eat and forgot to
take his new address with him.
   That was a month ago.
   ``This is embarrassing ... but I can't find the way back to my

``I've searched and searched.''
   Skogstad went to the newspaper in hopes his landlady would read

Tuesday, but there had been no call by Wednesday afternoon.
   Skogstad moved to the capital from the countyside and lost his
way in a maze of streets while walking to a cafe. His wallet, with
the address, was in the apartment.
   His search has been expensive: he paid a month's rent for the 30
minutes he spent in his apartment and also had to rent a hotel
room.

   Ousted federal Judge Alcee Hastings
lost a Democratic runoff for secretary of state to former
newspaperman Jim Minter, who faces Republican incumbent Jim Smith
in the Nov. 6 election.
   Hastings, 54, was Florida's first black federal judge when
appointed in 1979. The U.S. Senate removed him from the bench last
year for allegedly conspiring to obtain a $150,000 bribe, although
he was acquitted in a 1983 jury trial.
   ``Neither Florida nor the nation has heard the last of me,''
Hastings said Tuesday night. ``I will continue to fight for the
things I believe in.''
   Unofficial returns gave Minter 296,777 votes, or 67 percent, to
144,806 votes, or 33 percent, for Hastings. The runoff for the
Democratic nomination was required because no candidate got 50
percent in the primary.
   Only about 13 percent of Florida's 5.9 million registered voters
cast ballots.
   Minter resigned as an editorial writer for the Tallahassee
Democrat to enter the race.

   David H. Souter will become history's 105th
Supreme Court justice sometime between 9:15 and 9:30 a.m. Tuesday,
attend a coffee-and-doughnuts reception in his honor and then get

   The justices, Souter among them, will begin the 1990-91 term's

   Supreme Court spokeswoman Toni House said arrangements were
being made to get Souter legal briefs for next week's cases.
   ``He's indicated that he would like them made available to
him,'' she said.
   It was unclear just when the 51-year-old judge from New
Hampshire would arrive in Washington, but a White House reception
for him is planned for Monday evening.
   Souter, who won Senate confirmation by a 90-9 vote, will be
sworn in twice Tuesday by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
   In a private ceremony, Souter will take the constitutional oath
all federal employees take, and minutes later take a judicial oath
during a public ceremony in the court's ornate courtroom.
   Souter will attend his first closed-door court conference
Wednesday afternoon and will inherit from Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy a job once described as ``the highest paid doorkeeper in
Washington.''
   Because no one except the nine justices is allowed to attend the
conferences, the junior justice is responsible for sending out
messages or answering the door if someone knocks.
   Souter has a suite of offices waiting for him - those Justice
Antonin Scalia gave up when he moved into the chambers of retired
Justice William J. Brennan.
   But Souter doesn't have a permanent staff.
   ``We don't know what he wants to do about law clerks,'' Ms.
House said Wednesday. ``He will be provided with a temporary
secretary and a temporary messenger.''
   Each justice is allowed a personal staff of up to four law
clerks, two secretaries and a messenger.
   Souter, the sixth bachelor in the court's history, does not yet
have a Washington residence. Ms. House said he might stay
temporarily with Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., a longtime friend.
   Souter's place on the court dates back to the seat held by James
Wilson of Pennsylvania from 1789 to 1799.
   Bushrod Washington, the first president's cousin, held the seat
for the next 30 years. Twelve justices occupied that place on the
court between Washington and Brennan, who joined the court in 1956.

   President Bush celebrated Germany's
reunification from afar today with a call to Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and a Rose Garden ceremony.
   ``No wall can ever crush a nation's soul...This ismy message to
the German people,'' Bush said as he signed a proclamation at the
ceremony making today ``German-American Day.''
   Bush said he earlier called Kohl to congratulate him.
   Saying he had caught some of the reunification festivities in
Berlin on television, Bush said, ``I was very moved...and I just
felt I had to call him on this very special day.''
   Bush said that ``the moment has come because Americans stood by
Berlin.''
   In asking for Senate ratification of the treaty ending the
division of Germany, Bush recalled the nation's Nazi past but said
the Germans had shown their commitment to democracy for more than
40 years. He added that the Germans ``have not forgotten the past
or the role Germany once played in the horrors of 1933-45.''
   The Senate could act on the treaty as soon as today.
   But even though Bush demonstrated anew his strong support of
German unity, some other American political leaders and experts
admit to a little unease.
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., who was born in Berlin and fled
Nazi Germany with his parents at age 2, was among the most
forthright about his reservations.
   ``We will have to watch Germany,'' Boschwitz told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee a few hours before unification took
effect today. He said he supported the treaty but couldn't forget
the past.
   ``Germany is Germany from the standpoint of its history, and I
think we need to have some recognition of that fact,'' he said. ``I
have a mixed emotion about seeing it get back together again.
Hopefully the feelings and mentality of the people have changed.''
   Boschwitz said Germany will be the dominant force in Europe and
is already a leading world economic power.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I. chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said he shared Boschwitz's concerns.
   ``I agree with him that we should all keep our eye on how things
progress in Germany,'' said Pell, whose father, Herbert C. Pell,
helped prepare the Nazi war crimes trials in Nuremberg after World
War II.
   ``Lessons have to be drawn from history,'' said Elan Steinberg,
executive director of the World Jewish Congress. ``We have to
examine why Germany was divided in the first place. It's important
that Germany learn about the Holocaust and teach its young.''
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., noted that Germany's commitment to
cut its armed forces in half was not binding under international
law. The State Department said, however, that it regards the German
leaders' pledge to a limit of 370,000 as politically binding.
   ``I'm willing to throw my eggs in the basket that it will occur,
but I don't think we should kid the American public or anyone
else,'' Biden said.
   Some members of Congress have criticized West Germany's
willingness to contribute money but not troops to making Iraq
withdraw from occupied Kuwait.
   West German political leaders assert that their government's
Basic Law, adopted at the behest of the United States and other
World War II victors, prevents them from sending armed forces
abroad.
   Major German parties agreed recently that this provision should
be changed to allow Germans to participate in U.N. peacekeeping
operations.
   Angela Stent, a professor of government at Georgetown
University, said a united Germany poses no military threat to the
rest of Europe, but that it may become more assertive politically
because of its economic strength.
   Dan Hamilton, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
said Germany has become a major force in Europe partly because of
its willingness to act in concert with neighboring countries.
   ``Despite its enhanced weight in the world, it's not a
superpower. It is a power that exercises influence through and with
others,'' Hamilton said.
   Economists, meanwhile, are concerned that reunification could
help push up interest rates in the United States at a time when the
Bush administration wants to hold them down, so as to stimulate
business and create more jobs to avert a recession.
   C. Michael Ano, director of economic studies at the Council on
Foreign Relations, said East Germany and other parts of Eastern
Europe will be soaking up money from West Germany that otherwise
might help finance U.S. deficits.

   The House today approved a major immigration
bill designed to bring in skilled workers and unite families,
brushing aside administration concern that it could produce an
overflow of newcomers.
   The bill approved 231-192 would increase immigration by an
estimated 235,000 a year. A conference committee will now try to
resolve differences between the measure and a more modest Senate
version.
   ``This will preserve our heritage of getting the best and the
brightest from around the world and do it in a way that improves
rather than threatens our economic security,'' Rep. Bruce Morrison,
D-Conn., said.
   The bill would ease obstacles to reunification of families and
end 25-year-old barriers against would-be immigrants from northern
European countries and others that traditionally sent people here.
   The measure also would increase the number of highly skilled and
otherwise needed foreign-born workers permitted to enter the United
States.
   The measure is advancing in defiance of a veto threat from the
administration, which says the number of immigrants should be
limited to 630,000 annually, the figure in the Senate version.
However, the Senate limit could be exceeded under certain
circumstances.
   The House would increase the annual influx from the current
540,000 to 775,000 and pare down enormous waiting lists of spouses
and children waiting to reunite their families in the United
States.
   The House on Tuesday defeated, 266-143, a move led by Rep. Lamar
Smith, R-Texas, to cap immigration at 630,000 a year. It would be
an absolute ceiling in contrast to the flexible limit in the Senate
bill.
   Morrison expressed satisfaction after the House defeated the
cap, saying the vote represented ``the nearest thing to a test vote
on the bill.''
   Supporters of the limit warned that additional immigrants would
strain social services at a higher cost to taxpayers.
   ``The fact of the matter is, we can't take care of the people we
have now,'' said Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas.
   However, lawmakers opposing the cap said immigrants often are
among the most highly educated and skilled residents and would not
strain the system.
   Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., said the ``reason this bill is
important is because it's good for American business and it's good
for global competitiveness. Are we going to allow outdated
assumptions and nativism to hinder our growth.''
   Under the bill, immediate families of permanent residents of the
United States would have the same unrestricted right to enter the
country as is given to families of U.S. citizens. It would raise
the influx of such individuals from the current 436,000 to an
estimated 520,000.
   A ``diversity program'' also would be created under which the
government would provide 55,000 visas for people from 34 nations
that were adversely affected when the 1965 law did away with the
country quota system that governed immigration for decades.
   The legislation also would increase from 54,000 to 188,000 the
number of employment-based visas, with an eye to bringing in
skilled workers.
   Under the measure, which is supported by the AFL-CIO, employers
would attest to the Labor Department that bringing in workers from
overseas would be the only way to obtain the needed skills. The
measure then provides for a 30-day period to challenge that claim.
   For the first time, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland
would be treated as separate entities for visa purposes, doubling
their claim under the program to compensate countries that were
hurt by the 1965 law.
   The bill would provide 15,000 more visas for Hong Kong employees
of about 900 American companies doing business in that British
crown colony. The firms say they have suffered a brain drain of 24
percent of their top employees over the last year because of
jitters over the approaching transfer of power to China.

<HEAD>Economic Realignment, Slowdown Foreseen In Asia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crisis in the Persian Gulf is set to spur
an economic realignment in Asia, with important implications for
businessmen on both sides of the Pacific, analysts say.
   The troubles already have clipped the wings of Asia's ``Little
Dragons,'' slowing economic growth in the world's fastest
developing region. Financial markets have plummeted throughout East
Asia, led by an 80 percent plunge in Taiwan's main exchange.
   But in the long term, analysts say, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
could mark the beginning of a new era - with an emerging Vietnam,
improved economic ties between longtime enemies Taiwan and China,
and the tapping of Siberia's natural resources.
   ``The crisis could spark a major change in capital flows
throughout Asia,'' said Robert Broadfoot, a regional economic
consultant. ``Many of them will promote greater stability.''
   Right now, however, the crisis threatens one East Asian country
with instability: the Philippines.
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino's government, already
reeling from an earthquake in July and   coup attempt in December,
suffered another hit with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   It is totally dependent on foreign oil, and its factories could
grind to a halt if energy prices rise. Add to that the tens of
thousands of Filipinos fleeing home from jobs in the gulf and the
outlook for unemployment, already at 12.6 percent, is even grimmer.
   ``It doesn't take much to stimulate political unrest in the
Philippines,'' said Ranjan Paul, an economist at the Hong
Kong-based consultant Business International. ``The gulf crisis
could be the last straw.''
   Four countries in East Asia - the Philippines, South Korea,
Taiwan and Hong Kong - have cut their growth forecasts after the
Iraqi attack.
   South Koreans have been stocking up on kerosene to heat their
homes. Several Taiwanese investors have committed suicide. In
Thailand, also highly dependent on foreign oil, Bangkok's bourse
began broadcasting news bulletins to stop rumors from affecting the
volatile Thai stock market.
   Japan, one of the engines of the region, has so far churned
through the crisis without much trouble. Gasoline prices are up
only slightly. But rising interest rates and a 28 percent slide of
the already bearish stock market since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion have
sparked some concern.
   Analysts say the immediate beneficiaries of the crisis will
probably be Malaysia, Indonesia and China, the only substantial oil
exporters in the region.
   But their gains could be offset by a decrease in export earnings
if countries in the West, especially the United States, suffer a
recession.
   In the long term, Vietnam and its increasingly market-oriented
economy are being hailed as a possible winner in the region if the
crisis continues.
   Iraq's attack rekindled interest in tapping new sources of oil.
Since July, Vietnam has opened up five concessions for drilling
rights to its offshore oil fields to Western countries.
   Calls are also rising in the United States to end America's
15-year-old economic boycott of Vietnam. A bill before the U.S.
House of Representatives would exempt oil and gas exploration from
the embargo.
   ``The return of Vietnam to the international community could be
a byproduct of this mess,'' said Samuel Moon, of the Hong Kong
American Chamber of Commerce. ``We're hoping the U.S. government
will allow us to do business with them.''
   Analysts also see the gulf crisis as prodding Japan to improve
ties with the Soviet Union.
   The vast, untapped natural resources of the Soviet Far East
could provide Japan with another source of energy, timber and
minerals for decades.
   Tokyo's chilly relations with Moscow warmed slightly during the
September visit to Tokyo of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze. Analysts say the longer the crisis in the gulf
continues, the less importance will be placed on Japan's political
problems with the Soviet Union.
   Some officials think Broadfoot and other analysts exaggerate the
effect the gulf imbroglio could have on Japan-Soviet relations.
   ``That is really looking for a silver lining on a dark cloud,''
said Robert C. Fauver, deputy assistant secretary of state for East
Asian Affairs, in a telephone interview from Washington. He said he
foresees little change in Tokyo-Moscow ties.
   A final offshoot of the gulf trouble could be closer economic
ties between China and Taiwan, technically at war since 1949, when
Communist forces chased Nationalist troops from mainland China.
   Relations improved between the two after 1979 when China's
leader, Deng Xiaoping, launched market-oriented economic reforms.
Since then Taiwanese businessmen have invested millions of dollars
in China and thousands of Taiwanese have traveled there.
   More Taiwanese investment in China would increase stability in
Asia as the threat of a Communist attack to unite the two countries
recedes into the past.

<HEAD>Rising Heating Oil Prices, Falling Government Aid, To Hit Poor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite adequate supplies of heating oil,
millions of household budgets are expected to be strained this
winter as energy prices soar and government assistance programs are
unable to keep pace.
   ``We're going back into the `food or fuel' problem of the early
'70s for low-income and senior citizens,'' predicts Edwin
Rothschild, an energy specialist at Citizen Action, a consumer and
environmental group.
   Sharply higher prices could make the average season heating bill
of $800, common in much of the Northeast, closer to $1,200 this
winter, government and energy experts predicted.
   And federal budget negotiators are adding to the cost spiral.
The new deficit-reduction plan being considered by Congress adds a
2-cent a gallon energy tax on all refined petroleum products,
except for heating oil, beginning in January. The jump comes as
high gasoline prices and a proposed tax on gasoline impose sharply
higher transportation costs on most households.
   Federal officials told heating industry representatives and
state energy officials this week that, barring a further flare up
in the Persian Gulf, there will be more than enough supply of
heating oil and natural gas this winter. Stocks are higher than any
time in recent years and many customers already have topped off
their tanks.
   ``Right now we're in the best supply position for heating oil
we've been in three years. ... The hope is that prices will go
down,'' says Bernard Smith, executive director of the New England
Fuel Institute, which represents heating oil dealers in the region.
   The wholesale price of heating oil soared from about 56 cents a
gallon before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait to $1.03 a gallon
last Friday, although the price dropped a bit this week. Retailers
have absorbed some of the increase, but consumers still face
heating bills that are likely to be 50 percent higher than last
year.
   Clair Jarvis of the American Association of Retired Persons said
elderly people on fixed incomes may be among the hardest hit and be
forced to spend their food and medicine money on fuel. ``In the
long run they will suffer physically,'' said Jarvis, a retired
minister from West Virginia.
   But oil distributors say they also are victims of the oil
market.
   Vera Haskins, vice president of Mauger &amp; Co. Inc., a
Philadelphia area distributor, said her company so far has passed
only three-fourths of the price increase on to customers.
Nevertheless, the price has jumped 40 percent since July to $1.28 a
gallon.
   Soaring heating prices also batter low income households at a
time when the federal government and many states are cutting public
assistance programs aimed at helping the poor pay for heat.
   Federal energy subsidies for low-income families have been
halved since 1985 to $1.05 billion for this fiscal year - enough to
cover only one in every four people eligible because they are below
or near the poverty level.
   ``We think the states should be picking up more'' of the money,
said Janet Fox, director of the office in the Department of Health
and Human Services that administers the fund.
   Meanwhile, the Bush administration wants to phase out another
federal program that helps low-income people make their homes more
energy-efficient. The program provided $217 million this year, but
the administration wants to cut that to $30 million for this
winter, maintaining states already have money available for such
programs.
   But many state officials said their energy conservation funds
are shrinking.
   ``The states have either spent or already committed the lion's
share of these funds,'' said Jan Freeman, executive director of the
state energy office in Pennsylvania. ``The money is drying up. It's
not available any more.''
   ``The answer that the market is working and everything is OK is
not satisfactory,'' said Vermont energy official George Sterzinger.
``We're just concerned about whether people will be able to afford
something that is a necessity and will become an increasing
necessity in about a month.''

   Oct. 1
   Joplin (Mo.) Globe on the Soviet Union:
   Mikhail Gorbachev won another victory in his campaign to expand
his executive powers to deal with the economic crisis threatening
to disintegrate the Soviet Union.
   In the process of disappearing already is the empire in Eastern
Europe over which the Kremlin held sway by influence and, at times,
direct intervention. Today Moscow is the capital of a nation that
seems about to break apart under the pressures of ethnic strife,
regional nationalism and deep economic problems.
   Gorbachev has opened the door to a change in the Soviet system,
but he has taken a go-slow approach. That is not working; the
economy is getting worse. The solution is the dismantlement of the
state-run economy, as Russian Federal President Boris Yeltsin
advocates, and the freeing of individual initiatives to unleash
free market forces.
   Gorbachev may yet be forced to accept that fact.

   Philadelphia Daily News, on Quayle and the Middle East:
   There were giants in those days - Lincoln and Lee, for example -
but they had their pygmies, too.
   Which brings us to J. Danforth Quayle.
   You'd think the vice president of the United States, close to
the seat of power, would have many deep insights to share with us.
   That's why we should be interested in his observations about the
crisis of the moment.
   The man a heartbeat from the presidency explained (last) week
that despite efforts by Iraqi boss Saddam Hussein to compare a
possible conflict in the Mideast with the Vietnam War, the two
cases are not similar.
   Saudi Arabia and Iraq are mostly desert, Quayle pointed out,
while Vietnam was mostly jungle.
   Oh.

   Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, Tupelo, Miss., on universal
health insurance:
   A blue-ribbon federal commission has recommended that Congress
pass laws ensuring that every American has health insurance
coverage. But the report of the Pepper Commission did not call for
national health insurance or socialized medicine.
   The commission also failed to specify how it would pay for the
estimated $70 billion in extra costs for universal health
insurance. But it laid out a general blueprint that should serve as
the starting point for achieving the commission's goals.
   Simple financial arithmetic supports the commission's findings:
More than 30 million Americans with no health insurance and others
with inadequate insurance are pushing health insurance coverage
nationwide toward a breaking point.
   The people without coverage cause health and medical
institutions to collect their losses from people with insurance.
That sends costs skyrocketing.
   It is particularly important to note that the Pepper Commission
admits that the financial burden of health care in fact limits
access to service. In other words, health care is rationed
according to the ability or inability of one or more parties to
pay.
   The plan obviously leaves many blanks to be filled in with
specific proposals. But the commission has made a good-faith effort
to start productive debate.
   The commission makes a strong case based on hard facts. The
Congress and the Bush administration cannot ignore the issue
without further weakening our health care coverage and delivery
systems.

   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on fuel-efficient cars:
   Legislation that would require automakers to increase the fuel
efficiency of new cars suffered a bumpy ride in Congress.
   Logical as the idea of improved standards sounds, the proposal
ran into snags in the Senate ... and is not expected to survive
this year's lawmaking process.
   Congress should waste no time reviving the idea in 1991.
   U.S. News &amp; World Report magazine made a strong case for higher
fuel standards in a recent editorial calling for an increase in the
gasoline tax.
   ``Back in the 70s, when OPEC put a gun to our heads, we started
to drive smaller cars and Detroit rapidly improved its fleet's
efficiency,'' David Gergen wrote. ``American cars today get about
twice as many miles per gallon as the guzzlers of old. But with oil
prices dropping in the 1980s, `muscle cars' came into style and
Detroit's progress slowed significantly.''
   Once again, there is a gun to the nation's head. This time,
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein poses the threat. The Iraqi takeover of
oil-rich Kuwait has energy ramifications throughout the world. For
the second time in five years, the United States has sent military
forces to the Persian Gulf.
   Meanwhile, retail gas prices are climbing again. ... Some
analysts predict that if fighting erupts in the Mideast, prices in
the United States will rise to $2 (a gallon) or more.
   Rising gas prices should be incentive enough for the nation to
impose higher mileage standards on the auto industry. But there are
other reasons; pollution control, for one. Reducing fuel
consumption could decrease the amount of carbon dioxide cars spew
into the air.
   Legislation before the Senate would have required automakers to
increase the average fuel economy of new cars to 35 miles per
gallon in 1995 and 40 miles per gallon by 2001.
   Supporters said the requirement, upon taking full effect, would
save 2.8 million barrels of oil a day. But Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner criticized the legislation as dangerous, saying cars
would have to be built smaller and lighter.
   ``It should be called the highway fatality bill,'' he said.
   U.S. automakers have expressed similar objections.
   Considering that foreign automakers have developed prototypes
that get 70 miles a gallon and more, one can't help but wonder
about the real motives and interests of opponents of higher mileage
standards. The possibility ofiness comes to mind. So does the
fear of buyers resisting cars that might cost more.
   The technology to make cars more fuel efficient, without
sacrificing safety, seems to exist. Congress should force the auto
industry to act.

   Officials at the gallery that displayed Robert
Mapplethorpe's photographs thought the exhibit would be exempt from
obscenity laws but tried to get legal protection before the show
anyway, a board member testified today.
   ``At no time did we consider it obscene,'' said Stuart Schloss,
legal counsel for the Contemporary Arts Center. ``It was a serious
artistic exhibit.''
   He testified that gallery officials thought the artistic merit
of the exhibit made it exempt from Ohio's obscenity laws, though
they expected they would get complaints from the public.
   Schloss said, however, that the board took the precaution of
filing a lawsuit before the exhibit asking the Hamilton County
Municipal Court to rule whether the exhibit was obscene.
   The suit, intended to forestall any prosecution, was never heard
and was dismissed April 6. The judge ruled the plaintiffs had no
standing to file such a suit.
   The following day, the exhibit ``Robert Mapplethorpe: The
Perfect Moment'' began its seven-week public run here. The same
day, a Hamilton County grand jury returned misdemeanor indictments
charging the gallery and its director, Dennis Barrie, with
pandering obscenity and using children in nudity-related material.
   The defense had said that the case might go to the jury later
today after testimony from Barrie.
   In other testimony today, art critic Owen Findsen of The
Cincinnati Enquirer testified under subpoena from defense lawyers.
He said that based on his 20 years as a Cincinnati art critic, he
thought the Mapplethorpe exhibit contained artistic merit.
   The Enquirer had tried to quash the subpoena for Findsen at a
hearing in court Tuesday, but Judge David Albanese refused to set
aside the subpoena.
   In testimony Tuesday, art critic Jerry Stein of The Cincinnati
Post also testified that he thought the Mapplethorpe collection had
artistic merit, while an art historian testified that Mapplethorpe
took photographs to show the beautiful and the tortured aspects of
his life.
   Robert Sobieszek, historian and curator at the George Eastman
House photo museum in Rochester, N.Y., told jurors that the seven
photos under attack as obscene have as much artistic merit as the
rest of the 175-photo exhibit, which included portraits and floral
arrangements.
   ``The story was of a very full and rich artist who was
interested in documenting what was beautiful and elegant on the one
hand and tortured and troubled on the other,'' Sobieszek said in
videotaped testimony played for the jury.
   On Tuesday, Prosecutor Frank Prouty asked Sobieszek if
communities are ``at the mercy'' of curators who try to impose
their view of art.
   ``That would be a very harsh way of saying it,'' Sobieszek said.
   If convicted, Barrie could get up to a year in jail and a $2,000
fine. The gallery could be fined up to $10,000.
   Mapplethorpe, a homosexual, began work on the show after he was
diagnosed with AIDS. He died of the disease in March 1989 at age
42.
   The seven photos show the genitals of two children, a man
urinating in another man's mouth and anal or penile penetration
with various objects.
   Beatrix Mary Nevill of London and Claryssa Dalrymple of New
York, mothers of the children in the separate photos, said in
depositions that Mapplethorpe took the pictures and exhibited them
with their consent.
   ``It did not occur to me that there could be anything in the
photograph that would offend anyone,'' Ms. Nevill said of her
daughter's photo. ``I think it is a very charming photograph.''
   The U.S. Supreme Court's test of obscenity is whether the
dominant theme of the artwork appeals to prurient interest, whether
the work is offensive based on community standards and whether it
lacks serious artistic or political value.
   Defense attorneys noted the exhibit drew 80,000 people in
Cincinnati, wich they say indicates the photographs meet community
standards.

   Separate attacks by Tamil rebels left
five Sinhalese villagers and two policemen dead, military officials
said Wednesday.
   The villagers were hacked to death Tuesday by a squad of rebels
at Wahalkada village in the northern Anuradhapura district,
officials said. During the killings, other rebels besieged the
police station, preventing officers from aiding the villagers.
   The slain villagers included three women - two of them pregnant
- and a boy, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Six villagers were injured.
   Two policemen were killed and six were injured in a rebel ambush
on a patrol Tuesday night at Arantalawa village in eastern Ampara
district, officials said.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed since rebels from the
minority Tamil community started a violent campaign in 1983
claiming they are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese.

<HEAD>Rising Oil Prices Boost Factory Orders, But Industrial Sector Weak</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising oil prices from the Persian Gulf crisis
helped push up the value of orders to factories for manufactured
goods 1.8 percent in August, the government reported Wednesday.
Analysts said the oil-inflated boost disguised the weakness in the
industrial sector.
   ``To me, the number excluding petroleum is consistent with our
view that the economy is sliding and slipping into a recession,''
said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist with the Norwest Corp. in
Minneapolis.
   ``It continues to show the industrial sector is going nowhere
and may be sinking a little bit,'' added Bruce Steinberg, senior
economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. ``There's
nothing in the report to say we're not having a recession.''
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $244.6 billion, but
added that ``most of the increase is attributed to the petroleum
refining industry, which had substantial price increases during the
month. Excluding petroleum, orders increased 0.6 percent.''
   Sohn said ``energy prices went up even more dramatically in
September and orders then will be even more exaggerated.'' He
suggested the reports should be examined excluding petroleum costs
and ``my expectation is that orders will continue to soften.''
   Overall non-durable goods orders, which include petroleum,
advanced 4.4 percent to $117.1 billion in August including a $3
billion boost in the petroleum and coal category. Non-durable
orders had edged up just 0.2 percent in the month prior to the Aug.
2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Orders for durable goods - big-ticket items expected to last
more than three years - fell 0.5 percent to $127.5 billion after
rising 2.7 percent in July. The drop in August orders was a slight
downward revision from the 0.8 percent decline first reported last
week.
   The often-volatile defense orders also jumped following the
Iraqi invasion, up 14.4 percent to $8.6 billion after declining 5.1
percent a month earlier. Excluding defense, orders were up 1.4
percent.
   But orders for non-defense capital goods, a barometer of
business plans for expansion and modernization, indicated a
cautious investment attitude. Orders plunged 10.2 percent to $35.8
billion, erasing a 10.1 percent advance in July.
   Among durable goods, electrical machinery orders were up 2.9
percent to $20.9 billion after rising 1.5 percent in July.
Transportation orders rose 1.8 percent to $35.4 billion after a 4.6
percent gain a month earlier. Excluding transportation, orders were
up 1.8 percent.
   ``Within transportation, increases in motor vehicles and parts
and shipbuilding and tanks more than offset a decline in aircraft
and parts,'' the report said.
   Registering losses were non-electrical machinery, down 5.0
percent to $21.4 billion following a 3.5 percent gain, and primary
metals, which fell 2.3 percent to $11.5 billion after a 2.7 percent
rise.
   Shipments, which also were influenced by petroleum, rose 3.4
percent to $245.9 billion. Excluding petroleum, shipments were up
just 2.3 percent.
   Unfilled orders, which were not affected by energy, declined
l0.2 percent to $518.7 billion. The order backlog has been
relatively unchanged since May, the department said.
   Inventories edged up 0.2 percent to $373.9 billion but,
excluding petroleum, were unchanged from July.

<HEAD>Queen Says Jordan Still Receives Iraqi Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordan's Queen Noor said Wednesday her country
continues to accept oil from Iraq despite U.N. sanctions against
Baghdad because a total cutoff in supplies would cripple her
nation.
   The American-born wife of Jordan's King Hussein also appealed
for economic aid for her country which she said is on the brink of
financial disaster because of the Persian Gulf crisis brought on by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Noor said Jordan has reduced its dependence on Iraqi oil - it
formerly received 90 percent from Iraq and Kuwait - and is looking
for new suppliers. Moreover, she said Jordanians are not paying
hard currency for the Iraqi oil, which is in repayment for Iraq's
past debts to Jordan.
   Jordan supports the U.N. sanctions and condemns Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait, she said.
   Sh said Iraqi oil shipments to Jordan must be viewed in the
``proper context'' of Jordan's tight economic straits. ``The crisis
has dealt us an economic blow,'' she said.
   In addition, Jordan has sent some humanitarian supplies - food
and medical equipment - to Iraq as allowed by the U.N. Security
Council.
   In a wide-ranging question-and-answer session at the Brookings
Institute, the 39-year-old Noor, who grew up in the nation's
capital, said she sought to clear up any misunderstandings about
Jordan's position on the gulf crisis and draw attention to the
economic problems brought by the situation.
   Some Western diplomats contend Jordan has not done enough to
help cripple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and Saudi officials
have chided King Hussein for what they say is a failure to condemn
Iraq with enough force.
   Jordan expects to lose $4.1 billion as a result of the sanctions
against Iraq, its neighbor and formerly its most active trading
partner, Noor said.
   The country's gross domestic product may fall $50 million this
year, in part because some 350,000 Jordanians have returned to
their homeland where unemployment has doubled. Their remittances
have dried up.
   Noor said the international community has pledged help but the
country has ``yet received not much more than promises.'' Jordanian
officials have said if the international community wants Jordan to
strictly observe economic sanctions, it must provide aid.
   Coupled with the economic crisis is the influx of refugees who
have fled to Jordan from Kuwait and Iraq. ``Eighty percent of the
three-quarters of a million evacuees have traveled to Jordan,''
Noor said.
   ``Large numbers continue to enter, and, evidently this problem
will continue to be with us for some time,'' she said. The U.S.
Committee for Refugees, a private group, estimates 564,000 have
fled to Jordan from Iraq. Some 32,000 remain, but the others have
been repatriated, the group said.
   Noor reiterated her husband's opposition to having foreign
forces in Saudi Arabia and other gulf states. While Jordan condemns
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the annexation is an Arab problem
demanding Arab solutions, she said.
   Jordan would be willing to commit military troops to defend the
region if they were deployed under the banner of the Arab league,
she said.
   Saying she was speaking as a Arab, Noor said her countrymen
believe the United States and other Western nations are applying a
``double standard'' by refusing the impose the same kind of
sanctions against Israel that have been slapped on Iraq.
   The U.N. Security Council has condemned Israel for seizing Arab
lands in 1967, but has never enforced sanctions.
   She also called for international efforts to prod Iraq, Israel
and other Middle Eastern nations to eliminate any chemical and
nuclear weapons they may possess.
   On a personal note, Noor said the gulf crisis has had
``devastating consequences'' on her family life. Nevertheless, she
said she hoped her four children would be able to learn compassion
and responsiblity from the current situation.

   Heart attack patients who undergo an intestinal
operation to lower their cholesterol significantly reduce their
risk of suffering another heart attack or dying from heart disease,
a study shows.
   The surgery, called a partial ileal bypass, reroutes the bowel
to bypass about one-third of the small intestine. This reduces the
amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream.
   Dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directed
the study, said this surgery should be consdered as a possible
treatment for people with high cholesterol who cannot bring it down
enough by changing what they eat.
   An important drawback, however, is diarrhea, which afflicts
virtually everyone to some degree after having the operation. Other
possible side effects include a higher risk of gallstones, kidney
stones and intestinal obstruction.
   The study is called the Program on the Surgical Control of the
Hyperlipidemias, or high cholesterol. It was conducted in
Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   Despite the wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering, doubts
remain about whether it actually helps people live longer if they
alrhe desert to Jordan in search of relief,
only to be trapped in a 100-mile long caravan of refugees, baking
in the sun with little help available,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, who presided at the hearing.
   Eagleburger said the people who left Iraq and Kuwait impose a
severe burden on such countries as Jordan and Turkey. He
acknowledged that conditions in some camps were hard at first but
said there had been no deaths from starvation or epidemic.
   ``In Jordan, the worst camps have been closed and the residents
have been moved to new camps with adequate sanitation and
shelter,'' he said.
   ``In Turkey, the only victims of hunger and disease are newly
arrived displaced persons who developed their conditions while
still in Iraq.''
   He added that the most critical element in the emergency may be
the effort to get people back home. The largest number of these are
Egyptians, he said, but gave no further breakdown by nationality.

<HEAD>`Cradle of Rebellion' Celebrates End of East Germany</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ilse Mueller on Wednesday gently placed
a little red candle next to Leipzig's St. Nicholas Church,
considered by many the birthplace of East Germany's quiet
revolution.
   ``This is to remember all the people persecuted during those 40
years,'' Ms. Mueller said of four decades of Communist oppression.
   The gritty industrial city was the cradle of East Germany's
peaceful popular revolt last fall that later swelled into the drive
for unification.
   To celebrate the merger Wednesday, thousands of its residents
shopped and drank as the heart of the city was turned into a huge
open-air market. Western business people cashed in on the official
holiday by trucking in stalls that offered everything from leather
jackets to candy.
   But it was a time for reflection as well, especially for tens of
thousands in Leipzig who helped free their country by going to the
streets to demand an end to totalitarianism.
   Those weekly Monday marches began at the Lutheran church and
then spread along downtown streets to the headquarters of the
once-feared secret police. Demonstrators chanted ``We Are the
People!'' - a phrase that quickly became a nationwide motto for
pro-democracy groups.
   The day of reckoning came Oct. 9, 1989, almost exactly one year
ago.
   News reports at the time said Communist leader Erich Honecker
was considering ordering troops to shoot at the more than 70,000
demonstrators that night, hoping to end the pro-democracy movement.
   ``The whole city was tense, the hospitals even had extra blood
brought in case there was a disaster,'' said Sven Hornig, 25, one
of the marchers who gathered at the church that night.
   Miraculously, there was no bloodshed.
   Leipzig dignitaries, including famed conductor Kurt Masur, and
local party officials intervened to prevent violence - breaking the
authoritarian hold of Honecker's government.
   Honecker was ousted from power nine days later.
   Since then, St. Nicholas Church has become something of a
shrine.
   On Wednesday, hundreds of tourists and residents milled around
on the cobblestone square where the old church stands.
   ``I marched on Oct. 9,'' said one drunken Leipziger, trying to
keep his balance on a bar stool on Sachsen Square.
   ``For 10 marks, I will tell you all about it.''
   Like many Leipzigers, he was proud of his role in changing
German history, but the solidarity that brought that change is
gone. Many leftists and artists in Leipzig oppose the dissolution
of East Germany, saying the nation could have been salvaged as a
new democracy.
   More conservatives Germans say unity was the only answer.
   ``At the time (last fall), we were all limiting our demands to
democracy because no one knew how bad the economy was,'' Hornig
said. ``There would have been a total collapse and chaos without
unification.''
   Leipzig hopes to take advantage of its role in changing Germany
to become one of Europe's most important cultural and trade
centers. It already has impressive musical and stage offerings and
an annual trade fair.
   But many of the city's buildings are nearly in ruins after 40
years of Communist neglect. Right-wing extremism is rising in
tandem with joblessness and despair among many Leipzig youths.
   After church bells pealed German unity at midnight Tuesday,
about 100 masked neo-Nazis demolished cars, smashed windows with
clubs and fought with police. Six people were injured, and many of
the radicals were arrested.
   The unrest in Leipzig presents a united Germany with a new
challenge: to meet the hopeful expectations of those who took to
the streets to bury East Germany.

   Assistant State Attorney Leslie Robson argued that the right to
free speech is not absolute, saying: ``The First Amendment does not
give you the right to say what you want, when you want and where
you want. With rights and freedom come responsibility.''
   As the jurors began deliberating, alternate juror Sheryl
Salomon, who sat through the trial but was not needed on the final
panel, said she would have voted for acquittal.
   ``I was very offended by it, especially the lyrics, but I have
to question whether there is not artistic value,'' she said. ``It's
music, it's still music.''
   In the final day of testimony Tuesday, a psychologist testified
that the group's music may be degrading or humorous, but it's not
sexually stimulating.
   Merry Haber, a clinical psychologist in Miami who has been in
practice for 25 years, testified in Freeman's defense that she saw
no evidence rap music aroused prurient interest, an essential part
of the U.S. Supreme Court definition of obscenity.
   ``I have heard people tell me that they may put music on to
create a mood - a little Johnny Mathis and a little wine - but I
have never heard anybody say they were turned on by rap music,''
Ms. Haber testified.
   She said she gave the album to about 15 of her patients to get
their opinions. The women found it degrading, and both sexes said
it was somewhat humorous. All deemed it boring rather than sexually
stimulating, she testified.
   Broward County Judge Paul Backman has told jurors they should
find the album obscene if it appeals to ``morbid, shameful interest
in sex'' and violates the standards of average residents of Broward
County.
   The lyrics include graphic descriptions of intercourse and
sodomy and have been criticized as promoting violence against
women. Supporters of the Miami-based group say criticism of the
black rappers smacks of censorship and racism.
   Another defense witness, Greg Baker, music critic from the Miami
weekly New Times, disagreed that rap music is boring. ``It was
trendsetting. It's the biggest revolution in music since rock 'n'
roll itself,'' he said.
   John Leland, a music critic for New York Newsday who is
considered a leading authority on rap music, also testified on
Freeman's behalf that rappers ``were able to make exciting, vibrant
music that really drove people nuts. It provokes strong, emotional
reactions from people in the audience.''

<HEAD>Scientists Narrow Search for Marfan Syndrome Gene</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists are closing in on the gene that causes
Marfan syndrome, an inherited disorder that can make people tall
and thin and cause fatal heart disease.
   An estimated 25,000 to 30,000 people in the United States have
Marfan syndrome. Many victims are unusually tall, and the disease
is relatively common among basketball players. Abraham Lincoln was
also thought to be a victim.
   Finnish scientists said they believe they have found the general
location of the gene. This is an important step toward pinpointing
and understanding the precise defect that underlies the condition.
   Finding the gene should help doctors diagnose the disorder
before or soon after birth. However, even with this new
understanding, experts say the prospect of curing Marfan syndrome
is still remote.
   ``For the foreseeable future, the discovery of the cause of
Marfan syndrome will be of primarily psychological benefit to
patients,'' Dr. Reed E. Pyeritz of Johns Hopkins Hospital in
Baltimore wrote in an editorial published with the study.
   The disease can cause a wide variety of symptoms, but the most
serious is weakness of the heart. Victims may suffer leaky heart
valves or die of a ruptured aorta.
   The latest report was based on a genetic analysis of five
families with the disease in Finland. It was conducted by Dr. Leena
Peltonen and colleagues from the National Public Health Institute
in Helsinki and published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   The findings have been widely known in medical circles for
several months, and efforts are under way to see if the same
genetic pattern shows up in other families with the disease.
   The Finnish researchers narrowed down the location of the
defective gene to chromosome 15, one of the strings of genes that
contain all of the blueprints for making a human.
   When they find the defective gene, scientists will then be able
to figure out what it does normally and how it causes disease when
it malfunctions. Some experts believe the crucial gene may turn out
to be one that controls the body's production of fibrillin. This
protein is a building material of microfibrils, the fibers that
make skin and blood vessels stretch.

<TEXT>
   Tax increases and spending cuts in the 1991
bipartisan budget pact probably won't produce the $500 billion in
deficit reductions needed over five years, the head of the General
Accounting Office said Wednesday.
   Comptroller General Charles Bowsher told a Senate panel that the
deal reached by the administration and congressional negotiators is
a first step in reducing the deficit but more tax increases will be
needed in one to three years.
   ``It's a start - and I think we badly need a start,'' Bowsher
said. ``The budget is out of control and we badly need a plan to
get started.''
   Bowsher, whose GAO is an investigative agency of Congress, said
the size of the deficit problem had been understated. He estimated
a trillion dollars would be needed over seven years or so.
   He spoke before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee at a
hearing on the administration's response to government management
failures. He was questioned about the budget plan by Sen. Herbert
Kohl, D-Wis.
   Bowsher said the pressures for deficit cutting imposed by the
Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law have prompted the administration
and Congress to arrive at unrealistic estimates of future deficits.
Even if this plan is enacted, he said, similar measures would be
needed again.
   ``I'd be surprised if you didn't have to do it at least in three
years and maybe in the next year or two,'' he said.
   Bowsher and Assistant Comptroller Richard L. Fogel said the
federal government's capacity to manage itself is deteriorating
because of a failure to invest adequately in management systems,
computers and salaries for employees.
   As an example, he cited the Internal Revenue Service, which he
said is failing to collect $100 billion a year in taxes. He said
less than 1 percent of returns are being audited and that a decline
in IRS capability is one reason for the decline over time of
corporate tax collections.
   He said ``a good part'' of that uncollected tax money could be
obtained if the government used funds to modernize IRS computer
systems.
   Kohl asked Bowsher what message to the American people was
implicit in the bipartisan budget proposal.
   ``We can't run our shop so we have to go out and get more money
from you,'' Bowsher replied.

   A record store owner today was
found guilty of obscenity for selling a record by the controversial
rap group 2 Live Crew.
   Jurors deliberated less than three hours before convicting
Charles Freeman on a misdemeanor obscenity charge. He was arrested
by undercover Broward County sheriff's deputies June 8 for selling
the Miami rap group's album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' in his
E-C Records store.
   The case went to the jury of five women and one man after final
arguments this morning.
   Freeman could get a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. Sentencing
was set for Nov. 2.
   ``It doesn't represent my community where E-C Records is!''
Freeman, who is black, shouted as he left the courthouse. ``It's
unfair. The jury was all white. They don't know where E-C Records
is. They don't know a goddamned thing about the ghettoforcements from allies.
   Wolfowitz also elaborated on the fears of U.S. strategists in
the early days of the deployment about the vulnerability of
American troops to Iraqi tank attack.
   ``We had severe concerns about the ability of Iraqi armor to
penetrate rather quickly,'' he said. ``We didn't have anything on
the ground to stop Iraqi tanks. We don't want to ever be in the
position of saying that again.''
   The officials asked that Congress quickly approve the newest
sale to Saudi Arabia, and said additional sales to Riyadh, as well
as to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, would be requested
early next year.
   Next year's Saudi package will include F-15 fighter planes,
additional Patriot anti-missile batteries, and more tanks and
anti-armor weapons, Bartholomew said. The administration also is
considering requsts from Bahrain for Apache attack helicopters and
multiple-launch rocket systems, and from the United Arab Emirates
for Apaches, he said.
   Responding to concerns from supporters of Israel on the
committee, Wolfowitz noted the administration is prepared to
quickly transfer two Patriot batteries from current U.S. stocks and
is looking at additional ways to aid Israel militarily.
   Asked by Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., whether it is U.S. policy to
retaliate against Iraq immediately if it attacks Israel,
Bartholomew said: ``I don't have any reason to open that up to
question.''
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., raised the possibility that weapons
sold to Saudi Arabia could fall into enemy hands if its current
government ever falls, and cited similar past occurrences in Iran
and Kuwait.
   Bartholomew acknowledged that some U.S. weapons that had been
sold to Kuwait now are in the hands of Iraqi forces, including ``a
number'' of improved Hawk antiaircraft missiles, TOW anti-tank
missiles, self-propelled 155-millimeter howitzers and ammunition,
and about 16 A-4 attack aircraft.

   The House, defying a presidential veto threat,
approved Wednesday a dramatic expansion of immigration into this
country with a stress on bringing in more skilled workers and
unifying families.
   ``This will make America's economy more competitive while
protecting American workers,'' Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., the
sponsor, said following House approval of the measure, 231-192.
   A conference committee will now try to resolve differences
between the bill and a Senate-passed version.
   Supporters say the bill would reunify families currently kept
asunder by immigration law while bringing in skilled workers and
sharpening U.S. competitiveness in global markets. The Bush
administration and other critics say it would open the gates too
wide and create an overflow.
   Provisions would reduce long waiting lists of spouses and
children hoping to reunite with families in America. It also would
lower 25-year-old barriers against would-be immigrants from
northern European and other countries once viewed as traditional
sources of new Americans.
   The Bush administration has been calling for a maximum of
630,000 immigrants a year, the limit in the Senate-passed bill. The
House version would raise the yearly influx from 540,000 to
775,000.
   The House on Tuesday soundly defeated an effort to impose a hard
and fast cap of 630,000 on annual immigration. The Senate ceiling
is flexible and could be exceeded in some cases.
   Morrison expressed hope that the final product of the conference
committee would find favor at the White House despite veto threats.
He said lawmakers were ``in a position to narrow down the
administration's problems.''
   He said he expected House and Senate conferees to hold their
first meetings next week at the latest but added they will be
talking informally this week. Congress is heading toward
adjournment at mid-month.
   The bill would provide immediate families of permanent residents
of the United States with the same unrestricted right to enter the
country as now given to families of U.S. citizens. It would
increase the flow from a current 436,000 to an estimated 520,000.
   The measure also would create a ``diversity program'' under
which the government would provide 55,000 visas for people from 34
nations that were adversely affected when the 1965 law did away
with the country quota system that governed immigration for
decades.
   The bill would increase from 54,000 to 188,000 the number of
employment-based visas, with an eye to bringing in skilled workers.
   Under the measure, which is supported by the AFL-CIO, employers
would attest to the Labor Department that bringing in workers from
overseas would be the only way to obtain the needed skills. The
measure then provides for a 30-day period to challenge that claim.
   Under the measure, Ireland and Northern Ireland would be treated
as separate entities for visa purposes, doubling their claim under
the program to compensate countries that were hurt by the 1965 law.
   The measure would provide 15,000 more visas for Hong Kong
employees of about 900 American companies doing business in that
British crown colony. The firms say they have suffered a brain
drain of 24 percent of their top employees over the last year
because of jitters over the 1997 transfer of power to China.

   ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' with Audrey Hepburn
was a hit movie in 1961, but these days the meal can be had for the
high bid at a celebrity auction.
   For the right price, a buyer can enjoy breakfast with Miss
Hepburn at the tony Manhattan store. All proceeds will benefit the
Manhattan Center for the Living, a non-profit group that assists
people with life-threatening illnesses.
   ``They very sweetly contacted me and asked if I would help,''
Miss Hepburn said this week of the auction. ``It was so easy to
accept. I don't have to do anything but come up here and have
breakfast.''
   The event is billed as a ``Celebrity Fantasy Auction,'' and
other big names are joining Miss Hepburn. Bidders can also buy
lunch with actress Candice Bergen, drinks with NBC anchorman Tom
Brokaw or a night at Shea Stadium with Susan Sarandon and Tim
Robbins, co-stars of the baseball film ``Bull Durham.''
   The auction will take place March 4 at the Manhattan Center for
the Living.

   NEW YORK (AP) - ``Shogun, The Musical'' is getting a new leading
man.
   Philip Casnoff, last seen on Broadway as the American grand
master in ``Chess,'' will play the role of English sea captain John
Blackthorne when the musical begins previews at the Marquis Theater
on Nov. 1.
   Casnoff replaces Peter Karrie who opened in the show at
Washington's Kennedy Center last month. Karrie, who has starred in
the London productions of ``The Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Les
Miserables,'' will continue playing the role for the rest of the
Washington engagement, which ends Saturday.
   ``It was an amicable parting,'' Sam Rudy, a spokesman for
``Shogun,'' said Wednesday. ``The fact that Peter is going to
finish the Washington run is the best indication of that.'' He
didn't say specifically why Karrie was leaving.
   The lavish musical, based on James Clavell's epic novel of 17th
century Japan, opens in New York on Nov. 15.

   JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (AP) - George Lindsey, who played gas
station attendant Goober on ``The Andy Griffith Show,'' says fans
thought of the actors as good friends.
   ``I don't think the people who watched the show ever thought of
any of the cast as actors,'' he said. ``I think they thought of us
as their good friends.''
   The show premiered 30 years ago Wednesday, on Oct. 3, 1960.
   Lindsey is amazed that viewers still think the show's reruns are
just as funny as the original episodes were in the 1960s.
   Viewers long for the simple life in Mayberry, loosely based on
Griffith's hometown of Mount Airy, N.C., he said.
   ``I think that at some point, everyone wishes their life could
be as fun and carefree as Andy of Mayberry's,'' Lindsey said.
``Like any small town, people don't appreciate its simplicity and
peacefulness until years down the road.''
   Lindsey currently appears on the syndicated television show
``Hee Haw.''

   MALIBU, Calif. (AP) - Singer Bobby Vinton, best-known for his
1960s song ``Blue Velvet,'' enjoyed renewed popularity in the late
1980s with release of the quirky David Lynch movie named after the
song.
   Now, in the 1990s, the song ``Blue Velvet'' is being used
overseas in commercials promoting Nivea skin cream, which is
actually white but comes in a blue plastic bottle.
   The movie ``Blue Velvet'' was immensely popular in Great
Britain, elevating the popularity of the song. Now, with the
30-second Nivea commercials, it has landed in the No. 3 spot on
that country's pop music chart.
   ``This is something I really can't comprehend. It is really
something. It's just one of those songs,'' Vinton said Wednesday at
his ranch here. ``It was released over there in 1964 and it went
into the top 10.''
   Now, 27 years later, the commercials have caught the imagination
of teen-agers in Europe and it's back on the music charts.
   ``There is a cult of teen-agers who drive around in 1950s cars
and listen to Bobby Vinton music. I'm so wholesome and all American
- a real squeaky clean image, I have a tough time in America,''
Vinton said.
   The singer has re-recorded many of his hits for a new album
``Bobby Vinton Today.''
   ``It's not an oldy-moldy album,'' he said.

   JERUSALEM (AP) - Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin underwent
a successful hip replacement operation Wednesday, hospital officals
said.
   ``Mr. Begin is recuperating after an almost three-hour operation
to replace an artificial right hip joint,'' said Dr. Dan Michaeli
of Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital.
   ``He had a dislocation, something that happens through
wear-and-tear on the joint, especally artificial ones.''
   Begin, 77, underwent his earlier hip operation in July after he
broke his right hip in a fall at home. He had broken the same bone
in 1981 in a fall in his bathtub while he was prime minister.
   Begin, founder of the right-wing Herut Party, the precursor of
the Likud bloc that now heads the government, resigned as prime
minister in September 1983 without explanation.
   At the time, he was believed to be depressed about Israel's
military involvement in Lebanon and the death of his wife, Aliza.
   He has seldom appeared in public since his resignation.

<TEXT>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration seized
more than $1 billion in cash and other assets from drug traffickers
in the fiscal year that ended Sunday, agency chief Robert C. Bonner
said.
   Reaching the $1 billion mark ``shows that DEA has been quite
aggressive in stripping drug traffickers of their ill-gotten gains,
the proceeds of their illegal activities,'' Bonner said.
   The $1.025 billion seized, according to preliminary figures for
fiscal 1990, was far higher than the DEA's budget of $548.7 million
for that year, Bonner said. It represented a 4.4 percent increase
over the $979.1 million in assets seized by the DEA the previous
year.
   But Bonner said in an interview Tuesday that the seizures won't
help defray the federal budget deficit just yet. The assets must
first be forfeited, which can take years.
   ``That's something I had to occasionally point out to our local
law enforcement in Los Angeles,'' Bonner said, recalling his years
as U.S. attorney for the Central District of California from 1984
to 1989. ``You can't just take this and divide it up at the big
table.''
   For example, the DEA seized $979.1 million in assets in fiscal
1989, but only $299.1 million was forfeited that year, and much of
those forfeited assets had been seized in previous years, said DEA
spokesman Frank Shults.
   For the fiscal years 1985 through 1989, the DEA seized a total
of $2.81 billion in assets but only $865.2 million was forfeited.
Numerous cases still await court action.
   About 35 percent of the $1.025 billion seized, or about $359
million, was cash. The remainder was property such as boats,
planes, cars and homes, Shults said.
   Bonner, who replaced John C. Lawn about seven weeks ago, said he
would continue to stress asset seizures.
   As a federal judge before taking over the DEA post, Bonner
handled the forfeiture of $12 million in cash found with more than
21 metric tons of cocaine in a Los Angeles warehouse in September
1989.
   To win an asset forfeiture case, he said, a person must say
``this money belongs to me and it is not the proceeds of narcotic
trafficking.''
   There was ``$12 million in cash sitting next to 20 tons of
cocaine,'' he said. ``Not surprisingly, nobody came in to make a
claim.''
   State and local law enforcement agencies that work with the DEA
to break cases eventually share the assets forfeited.
   Such sharing has amounted to 35 percent of total DEA forfeited
assets during the fiscal years 1985 through 1989, with about $303
million going to state and local law enforcement agencies, said
William Snider, the DEA's forfeiture counsel.

   Leaders of a new Germany rushed to assure the
world Wednesday that it would strive for peace in the future and
would never forget the dark lessons of its Nazi past.
   As most of the nation savored its first hours of unity and
sovereignty after nightlong celebrations, leftist radicals
protesting unification rampaged in Berlin. Police fired tear gas
and water cannons in street battles, and about 50 people were
arrested.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, widely credited with making
unification possible, will visit Germany next month, a government
spokemsan said Wednesday. A hero's welcome is expected.
   In a message to governments worldwide, Chancellor Helmut Kohl
pledged Germany would never again pose the territorial claims that
marked Germany from its initial unification in 1871 to its defeat
and division in World War II.
   ``In the future, only peace will emanate from German soil,''
Kohl said.
   ``At the same time, we stand by our moral and legal
responsibilities that arise from German history,'' Kohl added. That
was a reference to the Nazi past and the Holocaust, which claimed
the lives of 6 million Jews.
   President Richard von Weizsaecker raised the same themes in his
speech at the ceremony in Berlin's Philharmonic hall.
   ``The Nazi terror and the war it caused inflicted untold serious
injustice and suffering on almost all of Europe and on us,'' he
said. ``We continuously recall the victims.''
   Among the several hundred invited guests was Heinz Galinski, an
Auschwitz death camp survivor and now the leader of Germany's
Jewish community.
   ``No one among us will forget that there never would have been a
separation without the war started by Germany under Hitler,'' said
von Weizsaecker, whose own father was convicted of two Nazi war
crimes for his role as a Foreign Ministry official.
   Von Weizsacker said: ``For the first time, we Germans are not
creating a point of contention on the European agenda.''
   Members of the renowned Berlin Philharmonic played works of
famous German composers, including Johannes Brahms and Johann
Sebastian Bach.
   The rebirth of Germany as the greatest economic power in Europe
has worried its neighbors, particularly Poland, one-third of whose
territory once belonged to Germany. Kohl singled out Poland when
saying that a future Germany will ``make no territorial claims
against anyone.''
   Kohl, however, reiterated plans to amend Germany's constitution
to send German troops to the Persian Gulf. He said a united and
sovereign Germany was willing to help U.N. efforts in ``protecting
and restoring peace.''
   Although Germany has committed $2 billion to the U.S.-led
multinational effort to isolate Iraq after Iraqi troops invaded
Kuwait, Washington has urged the Germans to do more.
   Germans say their constitution prevents them from sending troops
outside NATO territory, but Kohl reaffirmed in his message that he
will seek an amendment that will make such a move possible.
   His message came after Germany held a nightlong nationwide
celebration with fireworks and music.
   The nation united at the stroke of midnight when a giant German
flag was raised in front of the battle-scarred Reichstag building
in Berlin. Kohl, von Weizsaecker and other leaders joined in
singing the national anthem.
   The unification came 11 months after the Berlin Wall fell in a
peaceful revolt that cast aside Communist East German overlords.
   Random violence marred the unification celebrations overnight in
nearly a dozen cities, including Hamburg, Goettingen and Leipzig,
the cradle of East Germany's peaceful revolution against the old
Communist government.
   In Berlin, about 20,000 protesters, most of them young leftists,
rallied Wednesday in the working class district of Kreuzberg. As
the march moved toward central Alexanderplatz square, a group of
protesters wearing masks broke store windows, set cars afire and
scuffled with passers-by.
   Police battled the protesters with nightsticks and fired water
cannons and tear gas.

   President Bush staged his own celebration of
German unification on Wednesday, congratulating Chancellor Helmut
Kohl by phone and proclaiming ``German American Day'' at a Rose
Garden ceremony.
   ``Today, it is the wall that lies in ruins and our eyes open on
a new world of hope,'' Bush told an audience of German Americans
after military bands played national anthems of both the United
States and Germany.
   Bush called the remnants of the Berlin Wall ``a ragged monument
in brick and barbed wire'' that serves as ``proof that no wall can
ever crush a nation's soul. And this is my message to the German
people.''
   Bush said he earlier called Kohl to congratulate him.
   Saying he had seen some of the reunification festivities in
Berlin on television, Bush said, ``I was very moved...and I just
felt I had to call him on this very special day.''
   Bush had turned down Kohl's invitation to attend the
reunification festivities, claiming scheduling problems.
   Bush, who earlier sent a taped message to the German people
praising the unity effort, signed a proclamation designating
Wednesday as German-American Day.
   ``This moment has come because Americans stood by the people of
Berlin - from the daredevil pilots of the airlift to a young
president who made his bold declaration before the wall,'' he said,
referring to President Kennedy's ``Ich bin ein Berliner'' speech.
   In asking for Senate ratification of the treaty ending the
division of Germany, Bush last week said the Germans had shown
their commitment to democracy for more than 40 years.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Egyptians are traveling to
Kuwait and Iraq to bring home relatives or retrieve belongings
ranging from birth certificates to mink coats.
   Others hope to resume old jobs or win positions vacated in the
exodus of workers who fled after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Before they go, the Egyptians must obtain permits from Iraq's
consulate in Cairo. The papers, called ``facilitating documents''
rather than visas, allow entrance to Iraq and its ``governorate of
Kuwait.''
   Egypt has led Arab opposition to the Iraqi conquest, and
strongly rejects Baghdad's annexation of its small neighbor. But
Cairo has not prevented Egyptians from going to Iraq or Kuwait.
   ``Some of these people are very poor,'' said an official of the
Interior Ministry, which keeps track of the reverse exodus by
issuing permits to Egyptians who work outside the country.
   ``They have no alternative but to work there. They don't care if
there's a war or not. We can't stop them.''
   On Wednesday, applicants milled about outside the Iraqi
Consulate, awaiting their documents.
   ``I want to see if my school is still open,'' said Mahmoud, a
mathmetics teacher at a school in Kuwait who gave only his first
name.
   He seemed in a quandary about the journey, wondering aloud
whether he should take his wife. Men waiting with him strongly
advised that she stay in Egypt.
   On Aug. 2, about 1.5 million Egyptians worked in the two Persian
Gulf states. At least 400,000 fled in the days that followed,
thronging refugee camps in Jordan to await ferries to Egypt.
Western and Arab countries helped by sending aircraft and other
aid.
   But as weeks passed, returnees began feeling secure enough to
worry about possessions or jobs left behind.
   An Egyptian in Alexandria told of a friend who had worked in
Kuwait for many years but fled the advancing Iraqis, leaving his
car and other belongings.
   He went back last month and recently returned home in the car.
It was stuffed with electric appliances, silverware, china and his
wife's mink coat.
   Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Moussa said 5,062 Egyptians left
for Iraq and Kuwait through mid-September.
   ``Some believe they can find jobs, because many Egyptian workers
left for home,'' he said in an interview published Wednesday in
Al-Ahaly, a weekly newspaper. ``Others leave to bring back their
belongings and documents.''
   Figures at the Iraqi Consulate were far below Moussa's, and a
consular officer could not explain the discrepancy. He said the
office issued only about 800 permits through mid-September, with
hundreds more being processed. He said most were for Egyptians
returning to jobs in Kuwait.
   Of about 15 men and three women outside the Iraqi Consulate, all
but one said they planned to bring back family members or
possessions. Fearing Iraqi harassment, all asked not be identified
or allowed use only of first names.
   ``I love Kuwait. It's like my second home,'' said a man who
worked there as an expert with the Kuwait navy. ``There's no way
I'm going to work there for those people (the Iraqis). I'd fight
them if I could.''
   Ahmed, a burly man in dark glasses, said he was returning to
Kuwait for his wife and three children. They were stranded by the
invasion while Ahmed was vacationing in Cairo.
   Closely examining an Iraqi permit handed to a teacher, Ahmed
told him: ``You'd better be careful. I hear the Iraqis are keeping
the teachers and not letting them leave.''
   Mahmoud, one of three teachers outside the consultate Wednesday,
was the only one considering working in occupied Kuwait. Ahmed and
two others attempted to dissuade him. ``The atmosphere in Kuwait is
terrible now, destruction and terror,'' Ahmed said. ``The Iraqis
hate us.''

   The Confederate battle flag was stolen
from its perch atop Alabama's historic Capitol in a pre-dawn theft
Wednesday apparently by a man who told a news organization, ``The
South won't rise again.''
   A new Rebel standard was back in place by 9 a.m. flying below
the Stars and Stripes and the Alabama state flag.
   The Confederate flag, a target of protest by critics who contend
it symbolizes slave-era racial oppression, was hauled down by an
intruder in the Capitol, the site where Jefferson Davis was
inaugurated president of the Confederacy in 1861.
   Capitol Police Chief Cecil Humphrey said he assumes the flag was
stolen by the person who called news organizations around 3:30 a.m.
to take credit for it. The caller told The Associated Press that he
was from the ``justice league'' and that ``racism must fall.''
   ``The South won't rise again,'' he said.
   The Capitol is closed and mostly empty for restoration work.
   Buck Buchanan, building superintendent for Ray Sumlin
Construction Co., which is handling restoration work, said a lock
was broken on the metal hatch that leads to the dome's outside
walkway.
   He said there was another attempt to steal the flag several days
ago. In that incident, someone pried open the dome hatch and cut
the flag ropes, lowering but not removing the Confederate flag.
   Gov. Guy Hunt has said he will not remove the flag without
authorization from the Legislature, which has rejected such
proposals.
   The flag's supporters say it is an important part of Alabama's
heritage and is flown for historic reasons.
   State Rep. Alvin Holmes, one of 14 blacks convicted of
trespassing in a 1987 protest against the Confederate flag, said
Wednesday he wasn't familiar with any group called the ``justice
league.''
   ``No one ever heard of that in the black community,'' he said.

   Authorities arrested the last chief of
East Germany's spy network on espionage charges Wednesday in
Berlin, a federal prosecutor's spokesman said.
   The arrest of Walter Grossmann, coming hours after the two
Germanys united, backs up promises by prosecutors that they intend
to track down agents of East Germany's former Communist government
and pursue espionage cases.
   Earlier Wednesday, the Hamburg-based newspaper Bild reported
longtime spy chief Markus Wolf had probably fled to the Soviet
Union. Grossmann replaced Wolf in 1986.
   The federal prosecutor's chief spokesman, Hans-Juergen Foerster,
said Grossmann was arrested at his home in eastern Berlin.
   Grossmann will be taken to Karlsruhe, the judicial center of
Germany, where a decision will be made on whether to keep him in
custody, Foerster said in an interview. Foerster said he was being
held on espionage charges.
   East Germany disbanded the spy agency earlier this year after a
peaceful revolution ousted hard-line Communist leaders.
   Wolf, the former spy chief, had contacted the federal
prosecutor's office through his lawyer last week indicating he
would turn himself in, expecting to receive clemency, Bild
reported.
   Bild quoted Germany's chief prosecutor, Alexander von Stahl, as
saying he had ``denied a request by Wolf's lawyer to inspect the
files'' kept on the former spy chief.
   Asked where he thought Wolf was staying, Bild quoted von Stahl
as saying ``probably in the Soviet Union.''
   One of Wolf's major coups as head of the former East German spy
network was the planting of top agent Guenther Guillaume as a close
aide to former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt.
   When Guillaume's true identity was revealed in April 1974,
Brandt took full responsibility for the grave security breach and
resigned.

   France stopped issuing visas to
Lebanese on Wednesday, apparently because of President Elias
Hrawi's refusal to lift a blockade intended to end the rebellion by
Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Also Wednesday, funeral services were held in this coastal town
and other villages for 30 people shot to death Monday during a
candlelight vigil in support of Aoun. Women hurled themselves onto
the coffins of husbands and sons while mourners booed because the
papal nuncio failed to attend the services. Church bells tolled.
   The Communist-run Voice of the People radio station reported
France was no longer issuing visas to Lebanese, and a French
Embassy source confirmed the report.
   The military blockade of the area controlled by Aoun prevents
French consular officials from commuting between their two embassy
branches to complete visa formalities, the embassy source said. The
source spoke on condition of anonymity.
   French Ambassador Rene Ala on Monday conveyed to Hrawi France's
displeasure with the blockade, saying it would hurt the blockaded
region's population of 150,000 more than Aoun and his 15,000 mainly
Christian soldiers, the Voice of the People said.
   Ala told Hrawi the French government may close its embassy in
Moslem West Beirut if Hrawi fails to lift the siege, but Hrawi
``flatly rejected the French demand and threat,'' the report said.
   The ambassador drove from Hrawi's West Beirut residence to the
French Embassy office in the Christian suburb of Hazmiyeh in Aoun's
zone, but was forced to get out of his car and walk part of the way
with his bodyguards, the radio report said. Ala later left for
Paris, it said.
   France has sympathized with the Maronite Catholic community,
which supported its 1920-1943 mandate in Lebanon and has dominated
the country since independnce.
   Hrawi and Aoun are Maronites. The Syrian-backed Hrawi was
elected president Nov. 24 with a mandate to enforce an Arab
League-brokered plan to end the 15-year-old civil war between
Moslems and Christians.
   Hrawi's mainly Moslem 20,000-man army last week closed all
crossings and prevented essential supplies from reaching Aoun's
207-square-mile enclave in a bid to pressure the general into
submission.
   On Monday night thousands of Aoun's supporters demonstrated on a
highway bridge spanning the Death River to protest the blockade.
The rally was raked by gunfire, and police said at least 30 people
were killed and 100 wounded.
   Aoun blamed the massacre on Christian warlord Samir Geagea's
Lebanese Forces militia, which shares control of the area near the
bridge with Hrawi's soldiers.
   Hrawi's government said its troops did not fire on
demonstrators. Geagea accused Aoun of engineering the killings to
win sympathy.
   Earlier this year, Aoun and Geagea fought a four-month war for
control of the 310-square-mile Christian area north and northeast
of Beirut.
   The confrontation, which claimed more than 1,000 lives, left the
area partitioned. Geagea's 6,000-strong militia hold about 80
percent of the region while Aoun's forces command Meten province.
   Papal Nuncio Pablo Puente, who offered to mediate a compromise
between Hrawi and Aoun, had promised to go to the services in
Antelias for the Death River victims. But he did not attend.
   About 10,000 people in and around the church in the town five
miles north of Beirut booed when a bishop read a statement from
Puente apologizing for his absence.
   Women wailed and men brandishing black banners shouted for
vengeance when the flag-draped coffins of six Death River victims
were paraded in the church square. A mother flung herself on her
son's casket and a young wife embraced her husband's, wailing,
``Why God? Why?' Many mourners fainted.
   Aoun's top aide, Maj. Gen. Edgar Maalouf, read a eulogy on
Aoun's behalf, proclaiming the dead ``martyrs of the army.'' He
pinned military medals on the coffins.
   The other 24 victims, 12 of them soldiers, were buried after
separate funerals in other villages.

<HEAD>Court Hears Case on Punitive Damages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case that could
reshape how the American legal system penalizes wrongdoers in
lawsuits, wrestled Wednesday with conflicting theories and accounts
of skyrocketing punitive damage awards.
   The outcome of the Alabama case, in which an insurance company
was ordered to pay $1 million for fraud, could have enormous impact
on businesses and consumers.
   Bruce A. Beckman, a lawyer for the insurance company, said the
jury that awarded the money to a 59-year-old mother of five
violated the company's constitutional due-process right to receive
fair treatment.
   ``In the jury room, all it had to go on was its own notion of
right and wrong,'' Beckman said. ``That is exactly the arbitrary
and discriminatory enforcement due process condemns.''
   The system means wealthy companies are hit with multimillion
dollar awards ``even if the fault is small,'' he said.
   But Bruce J. Ennis Jr., representing the woman, said the penalty
was based on a 200-year tradition that gives juries broad but not
unfettered discretion to award punitive damages.
   ``You should not throw subtle state tort law into disarray
without substantial evidence that the majority of awards are
unfair,'' Ennis told the court.
   Urging ``judicial restraint,'' he said ``there does not have to
be a constitutional remedy for every problem.''
   Punitive damages have been ``used throughout the land for 200
years,'' he said. Only nine states, Ennis said, have placed
monetary limits on the awards after extensive re-examination by
legislatures.
   The hour-long argument underscored the complexity and
uncertainty surrounding the issue - including the possibility of
high court deadlock.
   A 4-4 split among the justices who took part Wednesday could
prompt the court to rehear the dispute later in its just-begun
1990-91 term.
   David H. Souter, confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday to become
the court's newest justice, won't be sworn in and take his seat on
the bench until next Tuesday.
   A ruling in the case isn't likely until next year even if it
isn't reargued.
   The dispute pits the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. of
Newport Beach, Calif., against Cleopatra Haslip, a former
$8,800-a-year librarian for Roosevelt City, Ala., a poor, largely
black suburb of Birmingham.
   Mrs. Haslip discovered her insurance coverage had lapsed after
incurring $3,500 in hospital and medical bills in 1982 for
treatment of a kidney infection.
   The insurance agent who arranged health coverage for Roosevelt
City workers had pocketed the premiums.
   Pacific Mutual said it had not sanctioned nor was aware of the
agent's misdeeds.
   The hospital demanded $600 before it would discharge Mrs.
Haslip; her doctor turned her case over to a collection agency, and
her credit suffered from her inability to pay the bills.
   Mrs. Haslip, who was in the audience during Wednesday's
proceedings, said she still owes money and has not collected the
$1,040,000 awarded by the jury in Alabama.
   The justices questioned both lawyers extensively Wednesday,
demonstrating their apparent uncertainty about how to decide the
case.
   Justice Antonin Scalia noted that punitive damage awards have a
long tradition.
   ``Who whispers in my ear it's a violation of due process when
it's been going on since 1791?'' he asked Beckman.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in questioning Ennis, said she is
troubled when juries impose big awards without guidelines.
   Giving juries limitless discretion ``is a very strange notion of
what due process means,'' she said.
   The case has attracted stacks of legal briefs on both sides.
   Business groups, the American Medical Association, the
pharmaceutical industry and major news media companies have urged
the court to restrict or ban punitive damages, saying runaway
juries unfairly penalize wealthy defendants out of sympathy for
victims.
   Consumer advocates and lawyer groups defend large punitive
awards. They say the judgments help keep dangerous products off the
market and protect the public against corporate greed.

   Iran's Parliament erupted in fistfights
Wednesday when radicals accused spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei of rigging a forthcoming election for a key government
body, sources said.
   The outcome of the election next week could determine whether
the government body retains Khamenei as Iran's top spiritual
leader, or replace him with a council of radicals who oppose
Iran's recent overtures to the West.
   Tehran Radio, which was broadcasting the heated parliamentary
debate live, abruptly went off the air as the arguments turned into
a scuffle, the sources in Tehran told The Associated Press in
telephone interviews.
   There was no report in the official media on the unruly scenes
in the 270-member Parliament. But the sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said several deputies were involved in the
fights. No details were provided.
   The fistfights in Parliament, known as the Majlis, sharply
underlined the deep divisions between the so-called pragmatists led
by President Hashemi Rafsanjani and his hard-line opponents.
   The violence in the Majlis, where debates are frequently lively,
capped months of maneuvering by Rafsanjani and Khamenei to control
the government body and a watchdog group.
   The government body, the 83-member Assembly of Experts, among
other things, chooses Iran's spiritual leader, the highest
authority in the Islamic revolution. The assembly has an election
scheduled for Monday.
   The watchdog body is the 12-member Council of Guardians.
   It has long screened legislation to ensure it conforms to
Islamic tenets, and it recently was given the chore of screening
parliamentary candidates for their ideological suitability. That
chore had been done by theologians.
   The Assembly of Experts has been moved from the holy city of
Qom, south of Tehran, to the capital in recent weeks in what is
seen as an attempt by Rafsanjani to bring it more under his
influence.
   The assembly overwhelmingly chose Khamenei, 51, to succeed the
late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after his death from cancer in
June 1989.
   The vehemently anti-Western hard-liners accuse Khamenei of
siding with Rafsanjani. Khamenei takes a more aggressive posture on
foreign affairs than the president, but both have been seeking to
sideline hard-line revolutionary radicals who they believe are
hampering efforts to liberalize the revolution.
   Rafsanjani is seeking to improve links with the West and Iran's
Arab neighbors to secure badly needed investment and advanced
technology to rebuild the economy following the 1980-88 war with
Iraq.
   The radicals claim such policies undermine the Islamic
revolution and deviate from Khomeini's fundamentalist doctrine.
   The hard-liners, led by former Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, have recently zeroed in on what many see as Khamenei's
weak spot, claiming he does not have the Islamic qualifications to
be Khomeini's successor.
   Khamenei lacks the top clerical rank of marja taqlid, or source
of imitation, and was only a middle-ranking cleric with the title
hojatoleslam, or authority on islam, when he was elected supreme
leader. He was swiftly promoted to the rank of ayatollah, or mirror
of god.
   But constitutional amendments approved in July lowered the
religious qualifications for the leader in favor of political ones.
   The sources in Tehran said the hard-liners were seeking to win
enough seats in Monday's election for the Assembly of Experts to
depose Khamenei and replace him with a radical-dominated leadership
council.
   To prevent that, Khamenei ordered his supporters on the Council
of Guardians to rule that all candidates pass an examination before
running.
   So far, the assembly members only have had to have good
revolutionary credentials. The new law requires them to to be
``religious jurisprudents.''
   Of 169 candidates who took the exam, 60 flunked, most of them
radicals, including Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karrubi, the sources
reported.
   Other radicals refused to submit to the examination. Three
hard-liners who iid pass later withdrew their names in protest.
   Khamenei, speaking to former prisoners-of-war on Wednesday, said
the new qualification was to determine whether candidates could
shoulder ``major responsibilities in the country's
administration.''
   He said rivalries such as the confrontation with the radicals
``are characteristic of the Western democracies, which neglect God
and religion.''
   Assadollah Bayat, a hard-line legislator, said the council
should not devise ``piety-meters and faith-o-meters to assess the
candidates.''
   Warning against insults leveled against the council, Khamenei
said:
   ``I will not tolerate ... slanders which have been made during
the past few days against the Council of Guardians ... to be
repeated.'' Iran's Constitution says anyone opposing Khamenei could
be tried for treason.

   Milwaukee workers rallied in memory of a woman
who died while trying to pay off a medical debt and a clinic was
established in a Los Angeles park as part of a nationwide drive
Wednesday to build momentum for a federal health-care policy.
   Rallies, information booths, picket lines and other activities
were planned at 50,000 work sites around the country, according to
the unions sponsoring the one-day campaign, ``Jobs with Justice
Health Care Action Day.''
   The effort is aimed at convincing Congress and the White House
that there is an urgent need for a federal health care policy. Some
37 million Americans have no health care insurance and millions
more are under-insured, according to organizers of Wednesday's
events.
   In Milwaukee, a rally and candlelight vigil were planned in
memory of Linda Williams.
   She was working three different part-time jobs - none of which
offered health insurance - to support two children in 1986 when she
learned she needed a $60,000 heart operation, said Ellen Bravo,
executive director of Milwaukee 9to5, a group representing office
and clerical workers.
   Williams had found a new job and had taken a second job this
year to try to pay off the remaining debt when she died on the job
of a heart attack, Bravo said.
   ``Who killed Linda Williams? In our opinion, she was the victim
of a lack of a national health care policy,'' Bravo said.
   In Los Angeles, the Service Employees union sponsored a
health-care clinic in a park to raise awareness about 10,000
teachers' assistants, 600 hotel workers and 2,000 janitors involved
in bitter battles to gain health care coverage from their
employers.
   None of the workers has health insurance, said union spokeswoman
Jennifer Fleming. The union lined up doctors and nurses to spend
the afternoon providing free blood pressure, vision and hearing
checks.
   In Texas, state workers in Austin are rallying over the 23
percent rise in health care premiums scheduled to take effect later
this year.
   Eduardo Diaz, leader of a state workers union, said, ``What's
really burning people is that somehow Congress has figured out a
way to pump billions into the S&amp;L crisis, yet they have not found
the will to institute a national health care system,'' Diaz said.
   Similar rallies were held, among other cities, in New York;
Salem, Ore.; Jackson, Miss.; Providence, R.I., and New Haven, Conn.
The Boilermakers union in Norfolk, Va., planned a one-day
demonstration at the Norfolk shipyard to protest proposed health
care cuts in current contract negotiations.
   Workers in some cities planned to picket outside hospitals.
Others planned to demonstrate at fast-food restaurants because
health-care coverage is rare for workers in that industry.
   Both the medical community and the insurance industry, which
frequently take much of the blame for spiraling health-care costs,
issued statements commending union workers on the campaign.
   However, the American Medical Association's statement said a
government-funded and -regulated health care system - which many
unions back as one option - would be an expensive ``invitation to
disaster.''
   Instead, the AMA said there are ways to fix current weaknesses
in the system, such as providing tax breaks to small businesses
that provide coverage.

   Musicians Carole King and John Oates joined
environmentalists Wednesday in search of a congressman who will
sponsor a bill to outlaw logging and mining on 13 million
wilderness acres in five Northwest states.
   The rock stars, appearing on behalf of the Alliance for the Wild
Rockies, said taxpayer money is being used to drill, build roads
and clearcut trees on U.S. national forests.
   ``If we stopped spending federal money to destroy our public
lands maybe we wouldn't have to raise the taxes that President Bush
talked about this morning,'' said King, a Grammy-award winning
songwriter and singer.
   The environmental group based in Missoula, Mont., wants to ban
logging, mining and road-building on public lands stretching
through Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon and Washington.
   Its proposed legislation also would protect 917 miles of
potential wild and scenic rivers and launch studies on nearly 2
million acres of national park candidates.
   Representatives of the organization met with a half dozen
lawmakers on Tuesday and scheduled meetings again Wednesday.
   ``Some environmental groups are like the unpopular kids at a
high school dance who stand around in the corner because no one
wants to dance with them,'' said Oates, of the band Hall &amp; Oates.
   ``I'm here to see if I can't get someone to dance with them,''
he said during a news conference in front of the Capitol.
   Executive Director Mike Bader, a former ranger at Yellowstone
National Park and a specialist on the grizzly bear, said there were
no formal sponsors so far, but he was optimistic there soon would
be one.
   Bader said King, Oates and Grateful Dead band member Bob Weir
have asked what they can to do to help further the group's cause.
   ``These celebrities are real people. They have real concerns.
They have seen the destruction that has happened on our public
lands and they want to do their part to help,'' he said.
   Oates and Weir joined actor Bill Curry on a bicycle ride through
Montana this summer to view the effects of clearcutting on the
region's forests.
   ``A few months ago, I didn't know the difference between a
national forest and a national park,'' Oates said. Logging is
allowed on national forests, but not on national parks.
   Curry said he got involved in the issue when he moved from New
York City to Montana's Bitterroot Valley about 18 months ago.
   ``I bought lands near a national park and they clearcut 300
acres behind my house. When I learned that I paid for that in
taxes, I was outraged,'' he said.
   King said efforts to defeat environmental legislation are based
on concern about the impact on jobs. But she said the group's
proposal would create new jobs for restoring the health of the
land.

   A Europarliament delegation was denied entry to a
restive enclave of Azerbaijan on Wednesday, one day after riots
erupted over an explosion that killed an Azerbaijani boy, news
reports said.
   The independent Interfax news agency said an ``unidentified
device'' exploded Tuesday in Kirkijan village in the enclave,
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Although the enclave is mostly Armenian, the explosion occurred
in a predominantly Azerbaijani area of the village, killing the
9-year-old boy and wounding his 11-year-old brother, Interfax said.
   About an hour later, 200 Azerbaijanis stormed into the Armenian
section of the village, attacking its residents and accusing them
of planting the device. Two Armenians were injured, Interfax said
without giving further details.
   The report could not be independently verified.
   Azerbaijanis and Armenians have been battling for two years for
control of Nagorno-Karabakh. Interior Ministry troops have been
deployed in the region to try to contain the violence.
   The Europarliament delegation, headed by Henri Sabi of France,
arrived Wednesday in Stepanakert, the Nagorno-Karabakh capital, on
a mission to try to help resolve the dispute. But the group was
turned back by the local army commandant for safety reasons, the
Soviet news agency Tass said.
   ``I am outraged by the attitude taken to us by
Nagorno-Karabakh's military authorities, especially as we have
arrived with the knowledge of the Soviet Foreign Ministry,'' Tass
quoted Sabi as saying.
   Tass said the group was sent back to Yerevan, the Armenian
capital, but gave no other details.

   Withdrawing a job quota plan aimed at
helping lower-caste Hindus could only lead to further violence,
Prime Minister V.P. Singh said in an interview Wednesday.
   Seventy-five people have died in riots or committed suicide in
protest since the government announced Aug. 7 that it was reserving
almost half of all federal jobs for lower-caste Hindus. There are
now some 17 million unemployed educated youths in India, many of
them from the upper castes.
   Singh told the United News of India that withdrawing his job
quota program could lead to more violence.
   The expectations of lower-caste Hindus have been raised, and a
policy reversal now ``would be difficult and possibly cause more
violence,'' Singh said.
   The Supreme Court has barred implementation of the job quotas
until it determines their legality. The court has scheduled a
hearing for Oct. 25.
   Singh reiterated the government's position that the quotas will
bring about social equity for lower-caste Hindus, who have been
suppressed for centuries.
   Hindus are divided into four major castes that determine a
person's social standing and often his economic position. Modern
India, whose 880 million people are 82 percent Hindu, professes
secularism and bans discrimination on the basis of caste. However,
the traditions remain.
   Public dissatisfaction over the job quotas has been widespread
in the politically influential cities of northern India. The army
has been called out, and curfews imposed in several towns because
of rioting.
   Northern India also has been plagued by renewed religious
violence this week, United News of India said. It said fighting
between Hindus and Moslems has claimed at least 40 lives in three
days in the region.
   The violence was apparently triggered by a Hindu group's
decision to build a temple at a site claimed by Moslems. The Hindus
say they will begin constructing the temple Oct. 30 in the town of
Ayodhya, 325 miles southeast of New Delhi.
   A 16th century mosque stands at the site, which the Hindus say
they will tear down. Hindus claim the mosque is built over the
birthplace of Lord Rama, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, one of the
most important Hindu gods.
   The Bharatiya Janata, or Indian People's Party, which backs
Singh's government, has supported the plan for the temple. Party
president Lal Krishna Advani last month began a 6,200 mile journey
through eight Indian states to gain support for it.
   Last year, at least 900 people died in Hindu-Moslem violence
after the Hindus first announced their decision to build the
temple.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
bestowed his endorsement on the $500 billion deficit-reduction
package Wednesday, telling Congress that failure to approve the
agreement would be a ``grave mistake'' with serious consequences
for an already weakened U.S. economy.
   Greenspan's views were considered crucial to chances for success
by a Bush administration that is hoping the Fed will support the
pact by lowering interest rates.
   Greenspan did not specifically promise to lower interest rates
but he replied with an emphatic ``most certainly'' when asked
whether he believed an enacted budget agreement would exert
downward pressure on rates.
   ``The budget summit has crafted what appears to be a credible,
enforceable reduction in the budget deficit stretching over a
number of years,'' Greenspan said in reading a statement at a
congressional hearing.
   ``If enacted, the budget package should reduce the drain of the
federal deficit on our national savings, lessen pressures in credit
markets and enhance investment and the long-run growth potential of
the United States,'' he said.
   Congressional and administration negotiators reached agreement
over the weekend on a package of spending cuts and tax increases
aimed at lowering the deficit by $500 billion over five years
through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts.
   While many in Congress have expressed unhappiness over various
components, Greenspan said he believed the negotiators had
``unearthed the maximum cut in the deficit feasible at this time,
with about the only mix possible, given the political context.''
   He said that rejection of the package would significantly dim
prospects for coming to grips with the ``corrosive effects of
budget deficits'' on the economy and would also make
already-jittery financial markets even more worried.
   ``Failure to enact the agreement would, in my estimation, be a
grave mistake,'' Greenspan said.
   ``I am fearful that failure to enact the agreement would produce
an adverse reaction in financial markets that could undercut our
economy - already significantly weakened by the shock of the Middle
East crisis and problems in our financial system,'' he added.
   Greenspan's comments came at a House Government Operations
subcommittee hearing on deposit insurance reform. In a series of
questions, he sought to allay concerns expressed by Republican
members of the subcommittee.
   Some of the most vocal critics of the deficit-cutting plan have
been House Republicans and the administration sees winning their
support as crucial to the ultimate success of the package.
   President Bush said Wednesday that Congress would be ``courting
disaster'' by failing to ratify the agreement but the White House
conceded that it did not yet have enough votes for passage in the
House.
   In his congressional appearance, Greenspan agreed that the
economic assumptions underlying the deficit accord might be ``on
the edge of being unrealistic'' and the full $500 billion in
deficit cuts were not likely to come about.
   But he said that the package was a credible step in lowering
federal borrowing demands, which he termed a serious threat to
economic growth.
   The budget package also received the endorsement Wednesday of
Greenspan's predecessor as Fed chairman, Paul Volcker.
   Volcker, on Capitol Hill to testify before another committee,
said that failure to pass the plan would be a ``very bad signal.''
   Greenspan for months has stressed the need to enact a
deficit-reduction plan viewed as credible by financial markets. He
has said that once such a plan was approved, the Fed would do its
part by lowering interest rates to offset the negative effects on
the economy from lower government spending and higher taxes.
   Since the agreement was announced Sunday, interest rates for
long-term bonds, a key factor determining mortgage rates, have
fallen slightly as investors have given at least a modest vote of
approval to the package.
   Federal Reserve policy-makers held a key meeting Tuesday to map
strategy for coming weeks.
   Many analysts believe the Fed officials voted during their
closed-door meeting to lower short-term interest rates and put the
rate cuts into effect if congressional work is completed on the
deficit package later this month.

   A Dec. 3 execution date has been set for
Henry Lee Lucas, who once confessed to killing nearly 600 people.
   State District Judge John Carter set the execution for the 1979
slaying of an unidentified female hitchhiker, who found strangled
in a culvert off Interstate 35, north of Georgetown.
   Lucas confessed to nearly 600 slayings before he began saying he
had made up the confessions. He now acknowledges only one killing -
the beating death of his mother in Tecumseh, Mich., in 1960.
   The hitchhiker case is the only one for which Lucas has received
the death penalty. He has been assessed six life terms, two 75-year
sentences and one 60-year term for other Texas convictions.
   Lucas still could appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, Williamson
County District Attorney Ken Anderson said Wednesday. Lucas'
attorney, Richard Alley of Fort Worth, didn't immediately return a
telephone call from The Associated Press.

<TEXT>
   Tragedy revisited Monaco's royal
family Wednesday when Stefano Casiraghi, husband of Princess
Caroline, died in a speedboat accident while defending his world
title.
   Caroline, a widow at 33, donned black mourning clothes and
rushed home from Paris, where she was visiting. Eight years and
three weeks earlier, her mother, Princess Grace, died after a car
crash.
   Witnesses said Casiraghi, 30, and co-pilot Patrice Innocenti
drove their catamaran, the Pinot di Pinot, straight into a wave at
about 93 mph during a morning heat of the World Offshore
Championships being held near Monaco.
   The 42-foot boat flipped over, ejecting Innocenti. Witnesses
said Casiraghi remained strapped to his seat and bore the full
impact of the vessel slamming into the water. The two-engine,
five-ton boat then sank, witnesses said.
   Gianfranco Rossi, head of the race organizing committee, told a
news conference Casiraghi was killed instantly. He said other
competitors, as well as divers and a doctor, rushed to the stricken
boat and found Casiraghi trapped in the cockpit, already dead.
   Casiraghi was a sophisticated international financier when, at
23, he married Caroline on Dec. 29, 1983.
   At his death, he was chairman of Cogefar France, the French
subsidiary of an Italian construction group owned by Fiat. He also
held a 52 percent interest in Engeco, which owns about 3,000
apartments in Monaco and is building a $160 million apartment
complex.
   And he was the father of three children - two sons and a
daughter.
   Casiraghi and Innocenti had been favored to win the three-stage
race, featuring sleek boats capable of speeds up to 125 mph.
   The accident came 30 minutes after the second stage opened
Wednesday. Organizers canceled the day's events but said they would
resume Thursday or Friday.
   Casiraghi had a passion for offshore racing. A competitor since
1984, he had won 12 of 80 races, including last year's world
championship held off Atlantic City, N.J.
   Weather conditions off Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, between Monaco and
Nice, were described as normal.
   ``He surely didn't have time to look out and, at that speed,
stuck under the boat, must have been killed by the blow,'' said
another racer, Michel Karsten.
   Emergency crews quickly pulled both men out of the water.
Innocenti was rushed to Princess Grace Hospital and Casiraghi
reportedly was taken to the adjoining morgue.
   The palace issued a two-sentence communique confirming the death
about four hours after the accident.
   The hospital said Innocenti, the boat's driver, was being
treated for his injuries. It did not elaborate.
   Caroline, the oldest child of Prince Rainier III and the former
Hollywood star Grace Kelly, divorced French playboy Philippe Junot
in 1980. She married Casiraghi on Dec. 29, 1983 in a civil ceremony
under a portrait of her late mother.
   They had three children - Andrea, 6; Charlotte, 4; and Pierre,
3.
   Their marriage brought some joy back to a family that was
devastated by the death of Princess Grace in September 1982.
   The automobile accident injured Caroline's younger sister,
Princess Stephanie, and left Prince Rainier emotionally
thunderstruck.
   The relatively low-profile lifestyle Caroline had enjoyed since
marrying Casiraghi contrasted vividly with the weekly splash she
made in the tabloids during the 1970s.
   The couple were reported to have a close relationship and
divided their time between Monaco, the tiny minicipality ruled by
Caroline's family since the 13th century, and Casiraghi's home
outside Milan.
   Their marriage followed Caroline's unhappy two-year union with
Junot, who was 17 years her senior. He was photographed many times
during their marriage in the company of other women.
   A Roman Catholic, Caroline sought to have her first marriage
annulled so she could wed Casiraghi in a religious ceremony and
have their children recognized by the church. She was never granted
the annulment.
   Casiraghi was born Sept. 8, 1960, the son of Giancarlo
Casiraghi, a self-made millionaire industrialist.
   He attended private Catholic schools, including the Gaillo
College in Como. He studied economics at the University of Bocconi
- considered Italy's most prestigious business school - but never
graduated.
   Instead, he launched his first business, REDIM, a real estate
concern. That success was followed by export companies that sold
sweaters and shoes in the United States.
   Casiraghi also relished the pleasures of the jet set. He
vacationed in chic resorts like Saint-Moritz in the Alps and
Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat on the Riviera, where his family owned homes.
   He met Caroline at Jimmy's, a Monaco nightclub, and soon broke
off his engagement to Pinuccia Macheda. He impressed the Grimaldi
family with his maturity and quickly won their approval.
   Corriere Della Sera, one of Italy's leading dailies, once called
him ``one of the true young lions of the jet set.''
   Casiraghi had two older brothers, Marco and Danielle, and a
younger sister, Rosalba.

   The art gallery director who is on trial for
showing homo-erotic photos by Robert Mapplethorpe testified in his
own defense Wednesday that he never wavered in his commitment to
display the works.
   Dennis Barrie, on trial with the Contemporary Arts Center on
obscenity charges, said he and the gallery's board had talked about
the controversy an exhibit of the photos had triggered in
Washington, D.C.
   The government-supported showing of Mapplethorpe's photos was
canceled last year in Washington amid a debate over federal funding
of art. The National Endowment for the Arts now requires grant
applicants to certify that the awards will not be used for work
that might be considered obscene. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., pressed
for the policy.
   Barrie, however, said the board strongly supported going ahead
with the exhibit.
   ``This was an exhibition of high quality. It had been seen in
other cities and was by a well-known artist,'' Barrie testified
under questioning by his lawyer, H. Louis Sirkin, in Hamilton
County Municipal Court.
   Seven photographs in the 175-photo exhibit are at the center of
the trial. Five show graphic sex acts involving men, and two show
children whose genitals are exposed.
   Barrie said he was not asked to alter the exhibit in any way and
would not have considered doing so.
   Under cross-examination by Assistant City Prosecutor Frank
Prouty, Barrie restated the gallery's commitment to display the
photos.
   ``I thought we had every right and every reason to bring this
exhibition to this city,'' he said.
   Prouty showed Barrie Mapplethorpe's five photographs of explicit
sex acts and asked Barrie to comment on them.
   ``He knew about light. He knew about shadow. ... As difficult as
the subject matter may be, you see the ability of the man working
through. He was brilliant with a camera,'' Barrie said.
   The gallery board's legal counsel, Stuart Schloss, testified
earlier Wednesday that the board tried to get legal protection
before the show. The board filed a lawsuit asking the court to rule
whether the exhibit was obscene.
   The case was never heard and was dismissed the day before the
April 7 public opening of ``Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect
Moment.''
   On April 7, a Hamilton County grand jury viewed the exhibit and
returned misdemeanor indictments charging the gallery and Barrie
with pandering obscenity and using children in nudity-related
material.
   If convicted of both misdemeanor charges, Barrie could be
sentenced to one year in jail and fined $2,000. The gallery could
be fined $10,000 for conviction on both counts.
   Prosecutors argued that they needed only to show that the
photographs were displayed in public, leaving it to the jury to
determine whether the photographs were obscene.
   Schloss testified that gallery officials thought the artistic
merit of the exhibit made it exempt from Ohio's obscenity laws.
   ``At no time did we consider it obscene,'' Schloss said. ``It
was a serious artistic exhibit.''
   Owen Findsen, an arts reviewer for The Cincinnati Enquirer, and
Jerry Stein, arts critic for The Cincinnati Post, testified Tuesday
and Wednesday that they thought the exhibit had artistic merit.
   The U.S. Supreme Court's legal test for an obscenity
determination asks whether the dominant theme of the artwork
appeals to prurient interest in sex, whether the work is patently
offensive based on contemporary community standards, and whether
the work lacks serious artistic or political value.
   Defense witnesses have described the exhibit as a retrospective
of the professional life of Mapplethorpe, who died of AIDS in March
1989 at age 42.
   The exhibit drew more than 80,000 people before its seven-week
engagement ended May 26.
   It went on to Boston where it opened despite protests and
103,000 tickets have been sold. The Boston show closes this week.

   The Washington University Bears' second-leading
receiver will miss the Oct. 20 football game against Colorado
College because of a previous commitment.
   Chris Warlick, a senior biology major, is going to be the only
undergraduate in the country to address more than 5,000 top medical
specialists at the American Society of Human Geneticists' national
convention in Cincinnati.
   ``It's certainly distinctly unusual for this to occur,'' said
Victor McKusick, a professor of genetics at Johns Hopkins. ``I
can't remember any in the recent past.''
   The title of Warlick's work: ``Isolation of a Yeast Artificial
Chromosome Clone D14S26 Near a Gene for Familial Hypertrophic
Cardiomyopathy and Identification of Two New Restriction Fragment
Length Polymorphism Probes at this Locus.''
   ``He's a very smart guy and he has a great career ahead of
himself as a scientist,'' said Helen Donis-Keller, professor of
genetics at Washington University's school of medicine. ``The work
that he's doing is of great interest in the scientific community
these days.''
   That's not so odd at Washington University, a Division III
school which has a reputation for producing scholars.
   There are no athletic scholarships, so Warlick and his teammates
play for the love of the game.
   Practice starts at 4 p.m., at least an hour later than for most
teams, because many players have labs late in the day. And even at
that time, Coach Larry Kindbom has become accustomed to starting
practice with about three-fourths of his squad.
   Last week, Warlick had an 80-yard touchdown catch, and he has 15
receptions for 255 yards and three touchdowns on the year.
   ``I wish I had a couple of years left to play, but it's not
conducive with my future plans,'' he said.
   Warlick is a B-minus student, struggling with calculus and
organic chemistry. ``Two killers - thank goodness they're of no
practical value,'' he said.
   Put him in a laboratory and everything changes.
   In the summer of 1989, Warlick began working in a genetics lab
at the school's medical center. This spring, the lab was part of a
project that also involved several other labs around the country in
a continuing attempt to map human genes.
   Warlick's main focus was an area of a chromosome near a marker
for a hereditary heart ailment, familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. It's a disease with no outward symptoms that can
strike quickly and fatally.
   Warlick discovered two markers on the chromosome that could help
narrow the search for the gene that causes the disease. His
discoveries will soon become permanent fixtures on the updated
human genetic map, and will bear his initials - CW1 and CW2.
   ``It's excitng,'' McKusick said, but added: ``I wouldn't call
it earth shattering.''
   ``This is the type of approach being used all over the place for
identifying the gene defect in particular diseases,'' such as
cystic fibrosis, McKusick added.
   But Warlick's discovery is so complex that he has trouble
boiling it down in layman's terms.
   He hopes to be involved in furthering this study but doesn't
want to miss out on any student experiences.
   ``College is probably the last chance you have to experience
these extremes and I'm taking advantage of it while I can,'' he
said.
   He's an adopted son of Ernie Warlick, a tight end for the
National Football League's Buffalo Bills in the 1960s, but until
last season had not played the sport since age 10 because he was
undersized.
   Now he's 6-foot-4 and 180 but it was academics that got him into
Washington University. He ranked eighth in his high school class in
Williamsville, N.Y., and turned down Dartmouth and Johns Hopkins to
accept a full-tuition scholarship awarded to talented college-bound
blacks.
   Coach Kindbom said three freshmen on the team turned down
athletic scholarships to attend Washington U.
   ``Football is a very important part of their lives, but they
want to do more than get locked into a situation,'' he said.
``We're talking about people who taste nothing but success, or else
they wouldn't be here.''

   Germans in East and West have made it clear that
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is the man of the hour for
clearing the way for unification of the two countries.
   Since last year, talks with ordinary Germans have revealed a
deep-seated admiration for the Kremlin reformer seeking to overhaul
more than seven decades of Communist thinking.
   And as the two German states merged at midnight Tuesday,
political leaders praised the man who boldly broke with the
Soviets' traditional refusal to even consider unification.
   ``We thank President Gorbachev,'' Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in
a unification-eve television address to the nation. ``He recognized
the nations' right to pursue their own path.''
   ``Without this decision, we would have not experienced the day
of German unity so soon,'' Kohl added.
   In fact, a heavy outlay of deutsche marks helped Gorbachev
swallow his national pride and clear the way for unification.
   Germany will pay the Kremlin $9.5 billion toward the cost of
removing the Soviets' 360,000 troops from former East German
territory. Even more aid is likely in years to come.
   Late Wednesday, a German government spokesman said Gorbachev
will visit Germany next month to sign a German-Soviet friendship
treaty. He is likely to receive a hero's welcome from grateful
Germans.
   Many Germans, despite their near hero-worship of Gorbachev,
worry that he will not hang on to power. That concern reportedly
spurred Kohl to quicken the pace of unification, before a power
struggle in the Kremlin could send things back to square one.
   Gorbachev's change of mind on Germany was an abrupt switch for
the Soviet people, who for years cited their 20 million dead in
World War II as the grounds for their suspicion - and often hatred
- of the Germans.
   Previous Soviet leaders exercised their dominance over East
Germany's then-Communist regime to block any talk of unification.
   During a formal state ceremony on Wednesday, German President
Richard von Weizsaecker also paid tribute to Gorbachev.
   ``Many people, among them we Germans, have reason to be
thankful,'' von Weizsaecker told the several hundred guests.
   The German lawmakers from East and West gave Berlin Mayor Walter
Momper a long round of applause at the same ceremony, after he
singled out Gorbachev for praise.
   Gorbachev visited then-West Germany in June 1989, receiving a
hero's welcome as people cheered and basked in what became known as
``Gorbymania.''
   Gone were the chilly meetings of West Germans and Soviets, with
the new-style Kremlin leader winning friends wherever he went.
   Even then, few could guess that just four months later,
Gorbachev would make another German visit with even more important
consquences.
   In early October, Gorbachev came to Berlin and bluntly told
then-Communist boss Erich Honecker to get on with a reform policy.
   ``Life punishes whoever comes late,'' Gorbachev told the
77-year-old Honecker, using a Russian proverb that most Germans
have since memorized.
   The message was clear: the Soviets would no longer support the
fossilized East Berlin regime that was then shaken by an exodus of
thousands of refugees.
   Less than two weeks later, on Oct. 18, Honecker was ousted in a
move that led to the breathtaking pace of unification.
   As the lights went out on the sovereign East Germany and the
mighty new country took center stage, outgoing Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere thanked Gorbachev as well.
   De Maiziere said Gorbachev cleared the way for East Germany's
peaceful revolution by refusing to prop up ``an anti-reform system
with the force of weapons.''
   That revolution in turn led to unification.

<HEAD>Bush Puts Popularity On The Line With Budget Package</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Blame me,'' President Bush invites nervous
Republicans as he searches for votes to pass an unpopular package
of tax increases and spending cuts. The budget deal may be painful
now but the alternative probably is a deep recession that could
doom Bush's re-election hopes in 1992.
   Bush has put his popularity squarely on the line for an
agreement that has sent election-minded congressmen diving into
foxholes. The deal will hurt everyone, with higher taxes on
gasoline, cigarettes, liquor and wine and increased health care
costs for the elderly in Medicare.
   ``It's like drinking a gallon of castor oil,'' said Sen. John
Warner, R-Va., ``but we're going to do it.''
   Maybe so, but Republicans lawmakers - led by House Whip Newt
Gingrich and other members of the GOP leadership - have deserted
their president in droves. They are particularly angry over Bush's
reversal on his no-new-taxes pledge, robbing Republicans of the
same popular campaign cry that propelled Bush into the White House.
   To win back the dissidents, Bush made a televised speech to the
nation asking Americans to take some bitter medicine to restore the
health of America's economy. He warned that if the agreement does
not pass, ``our economy will falter, markets may tumble and
recession will follow.''
   Presidential warnings of a dire economic future are only part of
a strategy that also includes arm-twisting sessions with
Republicans at the White House and private appeals in telephone
calls.
   Bush's high-profile stand is intended to give politicians a
ready excuse for digging deeper into taxpayers' pockets.
   ``Say the president encouraged you to do it,'' Bush said.
``Blame me, because I know what's best for our country. But I don't
suspect it's politically popular.''
   While all 435 House seats are up for grabs, Bush is not running
for re-election this year. His political life is not on the line,
so it's probably better for Bush to take his licks now.
   ``They've analyzed the economic situation and realize it's only
going to get worse,'' said University of Virginia political
scientist Larry Sabato.
   ``It's better to make a corrective move now than closer to his
re-election year,'' Sabato said. ``It's better (for Bush) to have a
recession now than in 1991 or 1992.''
   With his high popularity ratings, Bush can afford to take a hit.
His ratings have been bumping along as high as 80 percent, buoyed
by approval of his handling of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``The Persian Gulf gives him some shield, some protection,''
Sabato said. ``Presidential popularity becomes impervious to damage
in foreign crises.''
   Bush insists he is not making his decisions on the basis of the
election calendar.
   ``It's, I guess, about as complicated as a period as we've had
since I've been president,'' Bush said, referring to the twin
problems of the budget and the gulf. ``But I'm not looking at it in
terms of re-election. ... The American people are entitled to
something a little bit more broader-gauged than that.''
   Both sides in the budget battle are playing the underdog. For
the White House, that would make a victory seem to be an even
bigger triumph. From Bush's opponents, it is a message that Bush
doesn't need every GOP vote.
   Curiously, Bush is not demanding complete Republican loyalty on
what he says is a vote to avoid economic catastrophe. There is no
threat of White House retaliation, no warning of political
punishment.
   Bush even holds open the possibility that he could make a
campaign appearance for someone who votes against the budget
agreement.
   ``I can't bring myself to be recriminatory,'' the president
said.
   ``I wish all of them (Republicans) would support me strongly and
lay aside some of the passions that one of the other of them have
on a specific issue,'' Bush said. ``That probably isn't going to
happen, if I believe what I'm hearing on the television.
   ``So now what I've got to do is get 50.1 percent, and then we're
home.''
   Sabato, the political scientist, says that in withholding
threats against rebellious Republicans, Bush is simply making a
virtue out of necessity.
   ``Bush is not dumb enough to go up against the anti-tax wing of
the Republican Party too hard,'' Sabato said. ``That's probably
half his party.''

   Eleanor Steber, who began singing solos as a
child in West Virginia and went on to become a prima donna at the
Metropolitan Opera, died Wednesday.
   Miss Steber died of congestive heart failure at the Attleboro
Nursing Home in Langhorne, Pa., according to Martha Moore Smith,
her personal representative.
   Her age, widely misreported throughout her career, was 76, said
publicist Randall Fostvedt.
   Miss Steber became a soloist at age 5, in a Wheeling church -
but forgot the words to the song.
   The soprano was confident by the time she debuted at the Met in
1940 as Sophie in ``Der Rosenkavalier.''
   ``Thank heaven, all thought of its being my debut left my mind
entirely and I was caught up in the swell of the music,'' she later
recalled.
   As her voice matured, she undertook heavier roles such as Donna
Anna in ``Don Giovanni.''
   In all, she sang 404 Met performances in 33 roles - French,
Italian and German - through 1966. But she was known especially as
a Mozart interpreter, portraying such heroines as the Countess,
Fiordiligi, Pamina, Donna Elvira and Constanze, the latter at the
Metropolitan premiere of ``The Abduction from the Seraglio,'' in
1946.
   ``Mozart led to everything else,'' she said in a 1987 interview.
``It naturally led to Strauss. You learn how to sing through
singing Mozart and you can then do Bellini, Donizetti. Mozart was a
purist.''
   She appeared throughout the world: in recitals and musical
comedies; as featured soloist on television's ``Voice of
Firestone.'' Her 1940s weekly radio hour blended classical and pop.
   Sir Rudolf Bing, then Met general manger dismissed her without
explanation in 1963, three years after a New York Times article
proclaimed her ``indispensible'' to the opera company.
   She returned, at the Met's behest, in 1966 to sing Minnie in
``Girl of the Golden West.''
   She headed the voice department at the Cleveland Institute of
Music from 1963 to 1973, then taught at the Juilliard School of
Music. In 1975, she established the Eleanor Steber Music Foundation
to help the careers of young singers.
   ``I'm offered old-lady parts in musicals,'' she complained in
1980. ``Why don't they write a show about Tugboat Annie and ask me
to do it?''
   Plans for a memorial service were incomplete Wednesday.
Survivors include a sister, Lucille Leslie of Newtown, Pa., and a
brother, William C. Steber of State College, Pa. Her two marriages
ended in divorce.

   World leaders warmly welcomed a united Germany
into the international community Wednesday, but echoes of past wars
and concerns about the balance of power tempered some European
enthusiasm.
   ``A new era is beginning for Germany, for Europe and indeed, we
hope, for the world,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III
declared in New York. President Bush proclaimed German-American Day
in the United States.
   In Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev paid tribute to the
``peaceful and worthy solution of the `German issue.'''
   He cited ``all those in my country and in your country who,
overcoming sorrows, remembering losses and honoring the dead, did
not yield to prejudice and fears.''
   The unification ``symbolizes Europe's historic turning point in
the direction of establishing a new order,'' said Toshiki Kaifu,
prime minister of Japan.
   The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun said: ``Very few Europeans
seriously suspect a danger of Germany once again provoking war.''
It noted ``the keen awareness the Germans have exhibited of their
war responsibility and by their peaceful behavior ... over nearly
half a century.''
   West Germany's emergence as an economic power and the potential
strength of a united Germany unsettle some Europeans, including
Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   ``Germany will be very dominant in Europe, so it will be up to
the rest of us not to allow it to dominate. Others of us have
powerful voices,'' she said in a British television interview this
week.
   But in a message to German Prime Minister Helmut Kohl, she told
the German people: ``We face the future as friends, allies and
partners.''
   For Germany's neighbors to the north, ``This is the first time
in centuries that Denmark can view the coming togetherof a
stronger German state with calm and sympathy,'' said the
conservative Copenhagen daily newspaper Berlingske Tidende.
   ``The re-establishment of German unity takes place with the full
understanding of all the country's neighbors,'' the newspaper said.
``It is in Germany's own interest as well as a common hope that it
succeeds.''
   Commentators in Poland counseled Poles to view German
unification with joy instead of distrust, but not to drop their
guard.
   ``We do not turn a blind eye to the past,'' Ernest Skalski wrote
in Poland's largest newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza.
   ``We do not ignore troubles resulting from this difficult
proximity, but we count on a better future and we wish it to our
neighbors,'' he said.
   In Warsaw, President Wojciech Jaruzelski said in a message to
German President Richard von Weizsaecker: ``I trust that Germany's
unification will be one of the most important signs of a new era in
the history of our continent, free of burdens that caused
misfortunes and tragedies in the past.''
   In Israel, senior German diplomat Heimo Richter laid a wreath at
the Yad Vashem memorial to 6 million Jews slain in the Nazi
Holocaust and gave Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir a letter restating
German friendship. Shamir said he was disappointed it made no
reference to the Holocaust.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, also concerned about
German dominance, told Kohl: ``We have come a long way together. We
are going to continue ... Tell those close to you, tell all Germans
of the solidarity of France.''
   The French leftist daily Liberation, said: ``Germany united is
the victory of European reason.'' But it warned: ``On Oct. 3, 1990,
forgetting is forbidden: forgetting the distant past as well as the
recent. Neither the memory of Auschwitz nor that of democratic and
peaceful unification should be hidden away.''
   Romanian President Ion Iliescu told Germany, ``I am convinced
that unification will give a great impulse to the traditional ties
between Romania and Germany.''

<HEAD>NRC Names Task Force To Review Plant's Evacuation Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission named a task
force Wednesday to review emergency evacuation plans at the Pilgrim
nuclear power plant in Plymouth, Mass.
   The task force would be charged with determining ``whether the
NRC should reconsider its finding that there is reasonable
assurance that adequate measures can and will be taken in the event
of a radiological emergency at Pilgrim,'' according to an NRC
release.
   The NRC move follows a report issued in July by the commission's
inspector general that criticized the way the agency staff handled
emergency preparedness planning two years ago when the plant was
being readied for restart.
   James M. Taylor, the NRC's executive director for operations,
said the decision to assign a task force to examine Pilgrim's
emergency planning comes in response to ``the many critical
comments'' made at a public meeting last month in Plymouth,
according to the NRC release.
   The announcement also comes a day after Rep. Gerry Studds,
D-Mass., announced that a House investigatory panel would hold a
hearing in Plymouth on Oct. 22 on the NRC's handling of emergency
preparedness issues.
   In his July report, NRC Inspector General David C. Williams said
commission staffers gave the NRC false information by declaring
that residents near the Pilgrim plant could be protected in an
emergency.
   The scathing 15-page report concluded that the commission staff
said Pilgrim was safe to operate without looking in detail at
evacuation plans. The report accused staffers of relying on
unconfirmed information provided by the plant's owner, Boston
Edison Co.
   The misleading statements were made in October and December 1988
just before the NRC approved the reopening of the Pilgrim plant.
The plant had been shut down since April 1986 due to chronic
management and mechanical problems.
   Following the inspector general's report, Edison officials
insisted that residents around Pilgrim would have adequate
protection in an emergency based on current plans.

<HEAD>Nine Frenchmen Held Hostage in Iraq Arrive in Amman</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine Frenchmen held hostage in Iraq were
released in Baghdad on Wednesday and arrived in Jordan with the
private French group that secured their release.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, meanwhile, arrived in Abu
Dhabi, the first stop on his two-day Persian Gulf visit to meet
regional leaders and inspect France's troops.
   His arrival came just hours after the nine former hostages
arrived in Amman aboard a regularly scheduled Iraqi Airways flight.
   ``I am very happy that I have been released but a lot of people
remain in Iraq and Kuwait,'' said Jean-Yves Bobin, who had been
detained in Kuwait. ``We hope they can be freed soon and that all
things will develop toward a peaceful solution.''
   The nine, who received their exit visas from Iraq on Tuesday,
were to return to France later Wednesday, French Foreign Ministry
officials at Amman's airport said.
   Iraq agreed to release the hostages during a visit by a
five-member French delegation headed by Gilles Munier, who heads
the private Association for French-Iraqi Friendship.
   He called the hostages' release a ``generous gesture'' by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and appealed for a softening of France's
hard-line policy toward Baghdad since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   Munier is a member of the National Front, the ultraconservative
French political Party headed by Jean-Marie Le Pen. Diplomatic
sources in Baghdad said Le Pen himself might visit Iraq to seek the
release of more Frenchmen.
   About 300 French nationals are among the thousands of Westerners
being held in Iraq and Kuwait to deter any attack by the U.S.-led
military forces in the Persian Gulf region.
   The release came just two days after Iraq said it was willing to
hold contacts with the French government in an attempt to resolve
the crisis peacefully.
   Mitterrand suggested last week at the United Nations that the
resolution of the gulf crisis might be followed by initiatives to
solve the problems of Lebanon and the Palestinians.
   But Mitterrand has reiterated the West's insistence that Iraq
withdraw from Kuwait and free all hostages before negotiations take
place.
   Mitterrand's visit to the Middle East was the first by a Western
leader with forces stationed in the region to protect Saudi Arabia
and other gulf states from Iraq.
   After meeting leaders and reviewing French troops in Abu Dhabi,
he was to visit Saudi Arabia for talks with King Fahd and possibly
visit ground troops deployed at a forward staging area in the
kingdom.
   France is beefing up its ground forces to 4,000 men in Abu Dhabi
and Saudi Arabia, including a regiment of Foreign Legionnaires.
   France now has 13,000 men plus a dozen warships in the region or
on their way, the largest overseas deployment of French troops
since the Algerian war.
   Mitterrand said Sept. 6 that he intended to visit the gulf. It
was the same day he announced a major increase in French forces in
the region in response to a raid by Iraqi troops on the French
ambassador's residence in Kuwait.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Case Remains a `Massive Whodunit'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The case of five slain college students
remains ``a massive whodunit'' that may not be solved any time
soon, the area's chief state prosecutor says.
   About 150 members of a joint task force are still at work,
trying to learn who was responsible for the late August killings,
in which one victim was decapitated, State Attorney Len Register
told The Gainesville Sun for an article published Wednesday.
   ``It might take a lot longer than we hoped,'' Register said.
   He said the case is still wide open and the suspect list remains
fluid.
   ``Occasionally we'll pick up some suspects and we've been able
to eliminate other suspects,'' Register said, without naming any
either way.
   ``A fair inference is that this is still a massive whodunit.
This is not to say that we're not making progress,'' he said.
   The task force is following up about 5,000 tips logged in since
the murders, he said.
   Register revealed few details. Task-force members say they don't
want to release information that might be needed for a successful
prosecution.
   Register also refused to talk about laboratory tests. He said
700 items from crime scenes and searches are being analyzed by the
Florida Department of Law Enforcement.
   Sources told The Sun last week that lab tests failed to place
suspect Edward Lewis Humphrey at the three crime scenes and pointed
to someone else.
   Humphrey, jailed in lieu of $1 million bail on a charge he beat
his grandmother, goes on trial Monday in Melbourne on that charge.
   Register said investigators have not ruled out the possibility
that more than one person committed the crimes, but he seemed to
put no emphasis on that theory.
   ``I think it would be irresponsible if we close out any
scenario,'' he said.
   Increased police patrols will continue and Gainesville residents
should maintain safety measures, he said.
   ``College is a carefree time in your life, and under these
circumstances, that makes it a dangerous situation,'' Register
said.
   The bodies of the five college students were found in their
off-campus apartments Aug. 26-28.

   President Bssh's televised suggestion that
citizens call their congressional representatives to support the
tentative budget agreement caused phones to ring all over Capitol
Hill on Wednesday.
   Many calls, however, were from people opposed to the plan.
   A staff member who answered the telephone in the Washington
office of Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., started laughing when asked if
the office was getting a lot of calls.
   Gingrich, No. 2 Republican in the House, was on the budget
negotiating team but opposed the agreement and refused to
participate with the president in announcing the settlement.
   ``At 10 o'clock this morning in our Morrow, Ga., office we had
143 calls against it and 20 for it. And we'd only been open since
nine,'' said the Gingrich aide. She said the Washington office had
had 91 calls against the budget and 22 for it by the same time.
   Rep. Pete Geren, D-Texas, said constituents were ``all calling
their congressmen a whole lot more than yesterday - but they're all
calling to say, `Vote against it.'''
   In House Speaker Tom Foley's office, the phone was ringing
non-stop. One visitor said he overheard an exasperated receptionist
say ``Well, you'll have to vote against the president too, then!''
before hanging up.
   A spokesman for Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Budget Committee, said calls to his office were evenly mixed.
   Calls to the office of the House Ways and Means Committee
chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, also were running even. An aide to
the Illinois Democrat said most of the calls were coming from
individuals and not representatives of special-interest groups, and
from all over the country, not just Rostenkowski's district.

   Ogden and Josh J. Evans are on the general election ballot for
the district judgeship for Beaver, Cimarron, Harper and Texas
counties. Ogden died in August after he had filed for re-election.
   Should Ogden be elected, a vacancy would be declared and the
state Judicial Nominating Commission would advertise for
applicants. Three names would be submitted to the governor, who
would then appoint a new judge to serve Ogden's term.
   Evans has called efforts to get people to vote for Ogden

   A Republican candidate for the state

their plans before a panel and should be publicly humiliated in
newspapers.
   ``If you had five abortions, then we will do something to make
sure everyone in the world knows you've had five abortions,'' said

   Under Bechta's plan, women who exceed a certain number of
abortions would have to explain their actions before a medical
panel. Such cases would also be publicized in newspapers, even if
the state had to pay for the space, Bechta said.
   ``Public degradation, I think, would probably be the best way''
of deterring people from having multiple abortions, he said.
   Bechta's opponent, Democratic incumbent John D. Mordasky,
opposes all abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or risk to
the mother's life.
   Abortion rights activists were angered by Bechta's proposals.
   ``Of all the anti-abortion tactics we've heard about in the last
five years, this one takes the cake for being the most outrageous
and is almost comical if it weren't so serious,'' said Alice
Kirkman, a spokeswoman for the National Abortion Federation in
Washington, D.C.
   ``It sounds like the Romanian truth squads,'' she said.

<HEAD>Richards, Williams Trade Jabs Over Blind Trust</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ann
Richards criticized Republican Clayton Williams' offer to place his
holdings in a blind trust if elected governor.
   ``His sudden interest in distancing himself from his personal
businesses is nothing more than a cynical gesture to divert
attention from the very serious charges of insurance fraud that
have been made against his bank,'' said Mary Beth Rogers, Richards'
campaign manager.
   The Williams campaign called Richards' criticism ``rank
hypocrisy.''
   Williams spokesman Gordon Hensley said Richards' supporters
urged Williams to place his $100 million business empire into a
blind trust and then when he agreed they criticized him.
   Several state agencies are scrutinizing Williams' ClayDesta
National Bank of Midland for allegedly requiring customers to buy
expensive credit life insurance to get car loans. Williams has
dismissed the probes as politically motivated.
   Williams defended his proposed blind trust. Under a blind trust,
officials give up control and knowledge of their businesses to
separate their private and public affairs.

<HEAD>Annunzio Sought Home Loan Bank Board Job for Son-in-Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Frank Annunzio has acknowledged he once
tried to get a son-in-law a position with the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board, a published report says.
   Annunzio of Illinois is the second-ranking Democrat on the House
Banking Committee and chairman of its financial institutions
subcommittee.
   He wrote to Richard T. Pratt, chairman of the bank board, in
1983 seeking a position for his son-in-law, Kevin Tynan, the
Chicago Sun-Times reported in Wednesday's editions. Tynan did not
get a job.
   The letter, written on Annunzio's congressional stationery, was
obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the
Sun-Times.
   Annunzio told the newspaper he sought a non-paying position on
the federal home loan advisory council for Tynan.
   ``I did no more for Kevin than I do for dozens of other
constituents a month,'' Annunzio said.
   The letter said, ``I would also like to point out that if a
position is available that pays some remuneration for his services,
it would be most appreciated. I shall be grateful for any
consideration extended to Kevin.''
   The remuneration he wrote of referred to possible expenses,
Annunzio told the Sun-Times. Tynan is now Annunzio's campaign
manager.

<HEAD>Ava Gardner Book: George C. Scott `Beat Me'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The late actress Ava Gardner says in her
autobiography that former lover George C. Scott drunkenly beat her
and she aborted two babies fathered by husband Frank Sinatra.
   Miss Gardner, who died from pneumonia early this year in London,
makes the revelations in ``Ava: My Story,'' which arrives in
bookstores this week. Her films include ``The Killers,'' ``Whistle
Stop,'' ``One Touch of Venus,'' ``Show Boat'' and ``On the Beach.''
   She met Scott in 1964 on the set of ``The Bible.'' ``The trouble
that Abraham and Sarah were having on the biblical front was
nothing compared to the storm between George and me that was about
to break behind the scenes. ... When George got drunk he could go
berserk in a way that was quite terrifying,'' she wrote in the
Bantam book.
   In one fight between the two at the Beverly Hills Hotel, she
said Scott smashed bottles to make weapons. ``He was kneeling
across me, waving the jagged edges of glass in front of my face
with one hand and hitting me with the other. Telling me he loved
me, and smashing a fist into my eye. `Marry me, do you hear what
I'm saying?' followed by another blow.''
   She concluded her reflections on Scott by saying: ``Even today,
if I so much as see him on television, I start to shake all over
again and have to turn the set off.''
   A spokesman for Scott, Sean Mahoney, said, ``Mr. Scott has not
had an opportunity to read the book and thereby has no comment on
its contents.''
   Miss Gardner wrote that during her marriage to Sinatra, her
third husband, she discovered she was pregnant while making John
Ford's 1953 release ``Mogambo.'' She chose to have an abortion.
   ``MGM had all sorts of penalty clauses about their stars having
babies,'' she wrote. ``If I had one, my salary would be cut off. So
how could I make a living? Frank was absolutely broke and would
probably continue to be (or so I thought) for a long time.''
   She said Ford tried to talk her out of the abortion.
   ```Ava,' he said, `you're married to a Catholic, and this is
going to hurt Frank tremendously when he finds out about it.' ''
   She proceeded with the abortion without Sinatra's knowledge. He
was aware of a second abortion performed a few months later, the
book said.
   Other husbands were Artie Shaw and Mickey Rooney. She described
Rooney as a womanizer, but also ``charming, romantic and great
fun'' in the early stages of their relationship.
   A prominently mentioned male friend in the book is the late
tycoon Howard Hughes.
   The book is the result of 90 tapes recorded by Miss Gardner over
a two-year period. She completed the last tape a few months before
dying in January.

   Bridgewater wants to scare away its
birds, just for old times' sake.
   The Bridgewater Historical Society is starting a scarecrow
contest it plans to hold annually, and entrants can let their
imaginations run wild, said an organizer, Pat Schramm.
   The scarecrows can be the old-fashioned kind, stuffed with hay,
propped up with a rake and topped off with a wide-brimmed hat, or
the high-tech versions, made with wire framing and stuffed with
nylon pantyhose.
   The contest is aimed at reviving a piece of history and may even
have some educational value for the town's younger residents,
Schramm said.
   ``A lot of younger children have never even seen a scarecrow,''
Schramm said.
   Mary Allen, president of the historical society, said when she
was growing up in Bridgewater in the 1920s the scarecrow was a
common sight, put out by farmers to keep birds away from seeds and
crops.
   A rag often was draped around the scarecrow and tied in the
middle, leaving some of it hanging in the wind. The flapping made
it look just human enough to frighten away the birds, she said.
   The contest is open to the town's 1,600 residents, who have
until Oct. 24 to display their scarecrows. Prizes will be given for
various categories, including the funniest and the scariest
scarecrows.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union bought an additional 150,000
metric tons of U.S. soybean meal under a long-term grain agreement
between the two countries, the Agriculture Department said
Wednesday.
   Officials said private exporters sold the meal for delivery
through Dec. 31. The current agreement, including a three-month
extension, will expire at that time and a new five-year pact will
take over.
   The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting
companies, which are required to report large sales to the
department. No selling prices or further details were released.
   Meal prices at Midwest processors have been around $180 per ton
of 2,000 pounds each, according to USDA market reports. A metric
ton is about 2,205 pounds, indicating a value of about $198 per
metric ton, or a total estimate of around $27 million.
   Reports that the Soviet Union was in the market for meal helped
boost soybean futures Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Under the current grain agreement, the Soviet Union bought more
than 1.37 million tons of soybean meal during the fiscal year that
ended Sept. 30, along with 342,000 tons of soybeans.
   Grain purchases during the year totaled 20.3 million tons,
including almost 16.5 million tons of corn and 3.8 million tons of
wheat.

<TEXT>
   Voters in Alaska's largest city split
among three candidates for mayor, forcing a runoff this month
between two top finishers. In two other localities, voters rejected
prohibition of alcohol for personal use.
   Bethel voters, facing the southwest Alaska region's sixth
election related to alcohol use or sale in two years, rejected a
ban on alcohol possession by a vote of 541-318. In Barrow, the
northernmost community in the state, the prohibition was defeated
55-45.
   In both Barrow and Bethel, sale of liquor in restaurants, stores
and bars already is illegal, as it is in much of rural Alaska.
   The repeated attempts at alcohol bans are promoted by Eskimo
elders weary of suicides and injuries related to rural drunkenness.
   With all 91 precincts reporting, incumbent Anchorage Mayor Tom
Fink and advertising executive Rick Mystrom had 38.6 percent and
38.4 percent of the vote, respectively. Since neither got 40
percent, they must face each other in a runoff election Oct. 30.
   Red Boucher, a former Fairbanks mayor, lieutenant governor and
state legislator, got 21.5 percent of the votes in the Anchorage
mayoral race.
   Fairbanks elected a new mayor Tuesday: Wayne Nelson, manager of
a downtown office and apartment building. Nelson got 2,492 votes to
city councilman Lowell Purcell's 1,516 votes.
   In Juneau, a 6 percent wholesale tax on tobacco products was
overwhelmingly approved by a final unofficial vote of 4,511 to
2,537. The tax, opposed by the tobacco industry, will add 3 to 4
cents to the price of a pack of cigarettes and raise an expected
$36,000 a year.

   Carmen E. Turner, general manager of the Metro
transit system in Washington for seven years, was named Wednesday
to the No. 2 post at the Smithsonian Institution.
   Mrs. Turner, 60, will oversee the day-to-day operations of the
world's largest museum and research complex, which includes 15
museums in Washington and New York as well as the National Zoo.
   The appointment will be effective in mid-December. Her salary
was not disclosed.
   Secretary of the Smithsonian Robert McC. Adams praised Mrs.
Turner as an excellent administrator who will take a ``team
approach'' in coping with the Smithsonian's looming financial
crunch and internal management reforms.
   Mrs. Turner, who began her career as a government clerk-typist,
was named chief administrator of the Washington Metropolitan Area
Transit Authority in 1983. Her annual salary is $109,000.
   Metro is the nation's second-largest subway system and fourth
largest bus transit system, with a $615 million annual operating
budget and 9,000 employees.
   The Smithsonian has 6,600 employees and a budget of more than
$500 million.
   She succeeds Smithsonian Undersecretary Dean Anderson, who
resigned in July over what Adams called ``differences in
approach.''

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian guerrilla leader on
Wednesday warned of retaliation against U.S. targets if Iraqi
planes were hit with weapons under the U.N. air embargo against
Iraq.
   In a statement published by Baghdad's official al-Jumhuriya
daily, Abul Abbas called the air embargo ``the operation of air
piracy by one state against another to serve its narrow-minded
interests.''
   The comments heightened fears that guerrilla factions linked to
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would unleash a new terrorist
campaign against the United States and its allies confronting Iraq
in the Persian Gulf.
   Abul Abbas called the air embargo an ``American decision
dictated to the international community.'' The embargo is aimed at
tightening the economic squeeze on Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait,
which Baghdad invaded Aug. 2.
   ``We will not permit such legislation to be implemented against
our people and if any Iraqi aircraft is confronted by such air
piracy and should any damage be inflicted on Iraq's civil aviation,
we will retaliate,'' he said.
   He said the U.N. Security Council resolution was ``terroristic
legislation which does not serve world peace.''
   Abul Abbas, who heads the extremist Palestine Liberation Front
now based in Baghdad, did not specify what action would be taken.
   But he appeared to be talking about hijacking or bombing U.S.
airliners, since his warning concerned Iraqi aircraft.
   Abbas, whose real name is Mohammed Abbas, is one of several
radical Palestinian leaders now based in Iraq. Some have
specialized in attacks on airliners and airports.
   Among them are George Habash, leader of the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, Nayef Hawatmeh of the Marxist
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and a group led
by Hussein Mohammed Umari, whose nom de guerre is Abu Ibrahim.
   Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council group is also reported
to have moved back to Iraq after a vicious internal feud in which
hundreds of his men were killed.
   Abu Nidal, until recently reported to be in Libya, tops the
world's most-wanted list. He has been blamed for scores of
terrorist atrocities in recent years, including the December 1985
attacks on Rome and Vienna airports in which more than 20 people
were killed.
   The Popular Front was one of the first to begin hijacking
ariliners, in 1970. The group, the second largest faction in the
Palestine Liberation Organization, has about 1,000 fighters.
   The U.S. State Department Saturday warned Americans traveling
abroad that they run the risk of Iraqi-sponsored attacks.
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft said in Washington
Friday that Saddam was ``actively discussing things'' with
terrorist leaders in Baghdad.
   A NATO official said in Brussels last week that Saddam has
provided the groups ``with the wherewithal to conduct'' terrorist
operations.

   Fatal motorcycle accidents have dropped 31
percent since 1985 and 14 percent in the last year alone, a trend
due in part to the greater use of safety helmets, the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday.
   Other factors include a 19 percent reduction in motorcycle
registrations over the last five years and greater emphasis on
rider training, the agency said.
   But Jerry Ralph Curry, the agency's administrator, said the
improved figures represent ``progress, not success.''
   ``Half of motorcycle rider deaths involve alcohol, a proportion
that hasn't changed at all,'' He said.
   And he said more than 40 percent of the fatalities involve
unlicensed or improperly licensed riders.
   ``We still have a lot of work to do,'' Curry said.
   Motorcycle rider deaths numbered 4,564 in 1985, dropped to 3,661
in 1988 and declined again to 3,143 in 1989, the safety agency
said.
   It said that nationwide, motorcycle registrations totaled
5,215,941 but had dropped to 4,218,985 by last year.

   German-Americans applauded their homeland's unification
Wednesday but warned it will take long and hard work to improve the
economy of the former East Germany. Veterans who had to fight a
unified Germany said it was time to forgive - but not forget.
   An ABC News poll found that 80 percent of 1,002 Americans in a
random telephone survey support unification and 79 percent see no
threat. Among Americans older than 65, those of fighting age in
World War II, eight in 10 approved of a united Germany.
   People who faced the Nazi Holocaust had a different view. Joel
Rubin, who fled the Nazis when he was 12, was the only one of 97
people in his extended family to escape the Nazis during World War
II.
   ``I don't trust them. I cannot trust the Germans,'' he said in
Miami Beach, Fla.
   Others were cheerier.
   ``I wish I could be there to help celebrate. I'm happy for
Germany and for all the people,'' said Lena Bremer, 61, of
Freistatt, Mo., who spent her first 20 years in East Germany.
   The East Germans envy the higher standard of living the West
Germans have enjoyed for years, Bremer said.
   ``I think there will be some jealousy involved,'' she said.
``They (East Germans) think that they were cheated for so many
years.''
   Patricia Feltes, a Southwest Missouri State University assistant
professor of management, said Germans she has talked to favored
reunification but know there will be a price to pay for it.
   ``There's a view by West Germans that East Germans are
second-class citizens,'' Feltes said.
   ``It's wonderful but it will take a long time to accomplish and
maybe only the next generation will realize the benefits from this
change,'' said Maria Grewe of Gering, Neb. She grew up outside
Munich, Germany.
   ``It's very rewarding,'' said Donald Tillman, president of the
German Society of Maryland, whose father and uncles came from
Dusseldorf. ``We kind of won the Cold War without shots being
fired.''
   Men who fought in World War II in Europe have a different
viewpoint.
   ``They have a right to live,'' said John Loughlin, 69, who spent
more than a year and nine months in a German prisoner-of-war camp,
where he got regular beatings.
   ``Why hold a grudge?'' Loughlin, who lives at the Rhode Island
Veterans Home at Bristol, R.I., said Tuesday. ``You've got to
forgive.''
   ``Forgive but don't forget,'' said Daniel Sullivan, 80, who
served in England and Germany in World War II. ``You might be
walking away and get hit on the back of the head.''
   Germany's wounds must be healed, said Rhode Islander Beatrice
O'Donnell, 81, who was a nurse with the rank of captain at a
military hospital in England during World War II.
   ``The less division we have, the better off we are,'' she said.
``It caused a lot of animosity with that (Berlin) wall up. The hard
feelings were magnified by it many times.''

<TEXT>
   The House gave final congressional passage
Wednesday to legislation aimed at reversing the effects of a
Supreme Court decision that allowed employers to limit job benefits
for older workers.
   The House voted 406-17 to approve the same version of
legislation passed by the Senate on Sept. 24.
   ``This is a great victory for older workers,'' said Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, chief sponsor of the Senate version, after the House
completed action on the bill, which now goes to the White House.
   The Supreme Court held in a 1989 ruling that employee benefits
were not afforded protection under the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1967.
   The measure puts Congress on record as taking the position that
the high court's decision went against lawmakers' intent when they
passed the landmark age discrimination bill 23 years ago.
   Several lawmakers had been seeking to reverse the effects of the
court ruling more than two years ago in a case pitting June Betts
of Cincinnati against the Employees Retirement System of Ohio.
   At 61, Ms. Betts, a speech pathologist in Hamilton County, Ohio,
was disabled with Alzheimer's disease. She was denied disability
retirement because she was over 60. The ruling denied her an
additional $200 a month.

   Cancellation notices haven't gone out yet, but
NBC's ``Ferris Bueller'' and CBS' ``E.A.R.T.H. Force'' are on the
hit list, and ABC's ``Cop Rock'' has been pencilled in, an analyst
said Wednesday.
   Of the new series aired so far in the new season, NBC's ``Fresh
Prince of Bel Air'' has the most promise, said Richard Kostrya, a
senior vice president of the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency.
   ``It wouldn't want to call it a hit, but it's the strongest of
the new entries,'' he said in an interview.
   The fall season is just 2 weeks old and it will take a few weeks
more to see how viewing patterns evolve, he said.
   The A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings for last week declared ABC's
``America's Funniest People'' the highest-rated new show. It
finished at 13th in the weekly rankings. The rest ranged from
middle-level to the Nielsen cellar.
   ``Fresh Prince'' finished in 26th place. It was followed by CBS'
``Uncle Buck'' and ABC's ``Married People,'' which tied for 37th
place.
   CBS' ``The Trials of Rosie O'Neill,'' which placed 40th, is
losing its Monday audience lead-in from ``Designing Women'' and may
have to be transferred, said Kostrya.
   The new and old lineup of the Fox network ``is very, very
disappointing,'' he said. The new includes shows on the bottom of
the ratings rung - Fox's ``D.E.A.,'' ``Haywire,'' the Mark
Frost-David Lynch effort, ``American Chronicles,'' and ``Glory
Days.''
   Based on his analysis of viewing trends so far, he said likely
candidates for an early ax by the Big Three networks include NBC's
``Bueller'' and ``Hull High'' and CBS' ``E.A.R.T.H. Force'' and
``Uncle Buck.''
   ABC's radical ``Cop Rock,'' which mixes music with drama, was
56th-ranked in ratings in its premiere last week.
   It's too early to make a call on that showing, Kostrya said, but
it appears in trouble because it got a generally older audience
than advertisers usually seek. The kind of audience a show gets is
a major factor, he added.
   Although TV writers focus on the number of households tuned to
shows each week, he said, advertisers care most about the
demographics of the audience watching the programs - viewers' age,
sex, incoms, education and so on.
   The ``key demographic'' is an audience whose members range in
age from 18 to 49, he said.
   Although ABC is third in overall prime time ratings for the
young season, he said, ``they clearly are the number one network in
the key demographic.''

<HEAD>Backhoe Operator Cuts MCI Service to 5 States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A backhoe operator working on the Ohio
turnpike severed a cable Wednesday, interrupting MCI
Telecommunications long-distance phone service to parts of five
states.
   MCI spokesman Doug Dome said the damaged equipment was a fiber
optic cable that carries about 50,000 circuits. He said the cable
is one of the major east-west connections and that service was
affected in parts of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio and
Illinois.
   Dome said that both voice and data circuits were interrupted.
Some callers, he said, were redirected to use other long distance
services.
   Spokeswoman Debra Shriver said that area code 216, which
includes the Cleveland area, was the most severely affected, but
that some service also was lost in York and Pittsburgh, Pa., and in
Perryman, Md.
   Dome said the cable was severed about 9:15 a.m. EDT by a backhoe
operator who was working on a bridge on the Ohio turnpike near
North Royalton, Ohio. He said that MCI has a major service office
nearby and that repair crews were on the scene within 15 minutes.
   Service was restored circuit by circuit, said Dome, as the fiber
optics connections were made in the large cable, and that the cable
was ``just about 100 percent restored by 3 p.m.''
   AT&amp;T spokesman Jim McGann said some calls were diverted to his
company's service, but that the increase in calls was handled with
no problems.
   ``There was no impact on our network at all,'' he said.

   President Bush put down the telephone and
picked up a tennis racket Wednesday as he interrupted lobbying for
the deficit reduction package to team up with U.S. Open winner
Peter Sampras.
   Bush invited the 19-year-old sensation to the White House court
for a doubles match with Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, and Matthew
Meyer, a friend of Bush's son Marvin. Marvin Bush also played.
   Bush muttered as he walked on to the court that he was ``glad to
be off that telephone.''
   He had spent much of the day meeting with congressional
Republicans and telephoning them to urge them to pass the $500
billion deficit reduction package.
   The president played an aggressive net game that helped him and
partner Sampras win the first two games - one due to Sampras'
deadly serve. But when Bush served the third game, he double
faulted and the game was won by opponents.
   Sampras later told reporters that he and Bush prevailed to win
the set.
   ``I was impressed,'' he said of the president's dogged game.
``The MVP was the president.''
   Sampras said he and Bush chatted during the game about the
federal budget, the Persian Gulf crisis and tennis. He offered no
details, saying he could not remember specifics.

   The state of Israel should be moved to
Europe so that Europeans ``pay the price'' for past anti-Semitic
persecution, Libyan leader Col. Moammar Ghadafy said Wednesday.
   The statement, read to the U.N. General Assembly in Arabic by
Libyan Foreign Minister Jadallah Azouz El-Talhy, said the land
presently occupied by Israel should become a homeland for
Palestinians.
   ``The establishing of the Jewish state in Palestine was a
revenge against Nazism, which tortured the Jews in Europe and the
reaction against it,'' according to a translation of the statement.
   ``However, Nazism came to an end ... If the world is
sympathizing with the Jews against their persecutors in the past,
Europe is responsible for that and it should pay the price of that
by establishing a state for the Jewish people,'' he said.
   ``The Jewish character of the Jewish state in Palestine should
come to an end if the world is serious in establishing peace over
the land,'' the statement continued. ``Then this requires the
nations of the world to withdraw their recognition of the state,
and to make the state of Palestine democratic, without regard to
the religion of its inhabitants.''

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Senate candidate David Duke, who
once burned crosses to denounce blacks, is now asking for their
help, claiming Sen. Bennett Johnston ``has led you down the blind
alley of poverty, crime and human misery.''
   ``I'm not your enemy,'' the former Ku Klux Klan leader said in a
30-minute television fireside chat broadcast for the first time
Tuesday night.
   ``Your real enemies are liberals like Bennett Johnston who have
the assumption blacks can't compete with whites and must be given
preferential treatment and must be judged by lower standards. ...''
   Johnston said at a news conference Wednesday he didn't want ``to
dignify Duke's attack because he's not responsible for what (Duke)
says. He just gets up and makes wild charges.''
   During the past two weeks, the campaign has been waged almost
completely on television. Since the race heated up during the
summer, the two candidates have spent almost $2 million, much of it
on TV and radio.
   The primary is Saturday. Under the unique Louisiana system, all
candidates run on the same ballot regardless of party. If no one
gets more than half the vote, the top two go into a runoff on Nov.
6.
   Duke, 40, is running as a Republican without the party's
endorsement. The big question is whether he will poll enough votes
to force Johnston, 58, a Democrat, into a runoff. Three other
candidates also remain in the race.
   The most recent poll, taken by the University of New Orleans
about three weeks ago, found that Johnston had slipped from 48
percent to 46 percent, Duke remained at 21 percent, and Ben Bagert,
the official GOP nominee, remained far behind at 8 percent. The
undecided vote had increased to 20 percent, with the rest refusing
to answer questions.
   Duke, also at a news conference Wednesday, said he expected to
get at least 40 percent of the vote and force Johnston into a
runoff.
   Ironically, many of Bagert's fellow Republicans are urging votes
for Johnston to keep Duke out of a runoff.
   Democratic Gov. Buddy Roemer urged voters Tuesday to shun Duke
by re-electing Johnston. He said a strong showing by Duke would
send the wrong signal to the nation and deter the state's economic
development.
   Johnston, an 18-year incumbent, has spent much of his time
recently in Washington for the budget debate. While out of the
state, he relied mostly on brief TV spots assailing Duke's past as
a klansman, depicting him as a neo-Nazi and outright liar.
   Some commercials show old film of Duke in his klan robes in
front of a burning cross, saluting like a Nazi.
   Duke, who called the burning cross ad cowardly, used his
30-minute program to apologize for what he calls the stupid
mistakes of his youth.
   On Tuesday, Michael Wahlder, an Alexandria lawyer and a
Republican, one of three lesser known candidates, dropped out of
the race and urged Bagert to do the same.
   Two other political unknowns, both Democrats, remain in the
race.
   Many prominent Republicans, especially on the national level,
have urged party members to vote for Johnston to avoid a runoff
between the incumbent and Duke that would be an embarrassment to
the GOP.
   On Wednesday, eight Republican senators from other states urged
re-election of Johnston as a repudiation of what they said was
Duke's racism, anti-semitism and hatred.
   ``All of us would be embarrassed and mortified to have to serve
in the United States Senate with David Duke masquerading as a
Republican,'' said Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
   Kelly Johnston, deputy political director of the Republican
Senate Campaign Committee, said a runoff between Johnston and Duke
``would be the worst possible thing that could happen to us.'' It
would allow Democrats across the nation to link any Republican in
the November general election to Duke, she said.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, attended a news conference recently
with Johnston, urging Bagert to drop out and throw his support to
the Democrat.
   Bagert, a state legislator since 1968, changed to the GOP after
the last election and was urged by the party to run against
Johnston.
   The national GOP drive to support Johnston ``is treachery,''
said Bagert, who was endorsed by President Bush. ``These Georgetown
swells with their lunches on pewter plates decided they could
sacrifice the Louisiana GOP and renege on their commitment to me.''
   In addition to the candidates' ads, the Louisiana Coalition
Against Racism and Nazism is running an anti-Duke ad, a parody of
the ``Jeopardy'' game show in which questions deal with Duke's
past.
   KTAL-TV in Shreveport stopped running the ad Tuesday after
receiving an anonymous bomb threat.

   Snow made an appearance in Idaho Wednesday, and floods continued
to plague the Rio Grande in Texas.
   Light snow fell during the morning over the mountains of central
Idaho. About an inch of snow accumulated at Dixie and McCall had
less than an inch.
   High winds damaged roofs of some downtown buildings and knocked
out power at an elementary school today as severe thunderstorms
moved through Cockrell Hill, Texas, just south of Dallas.
   Several residents reported seeing a tornado, but the National
Weather Service and local officials could not confirm the tornado
reports.
   Flood warnings remained in effect along the Rio Grande from
Presidio, to near Langtry, Texas. The river was near crest
Wednesday morning at Castolon, 4 feet above flood stage. The crest
was expected to be 5{ feet higher than flood stage at Presidio on
Thursday.
   By midday, showers and a few thunderstorms extended from
south-central Texas across the Southeast into southwest Georgia and
Florida.
   Rain and occasional thunderstorms reached from north-central
Texas northward to northern Indiana and western Illinois.
   Rain also stretched over the Nebraska panhandle, from western
Montana into Washington state, and across northwest Oregon with
light snow in the higher elevations of Idaho.
   Heavier rainfall hours included 2.03 inches at Joplin, Mo., 1.45
at Tulsa, Okla., 1.15 at Ottumwa, Iowa, 1.12 at Lamoni, Iowa, and
1.11 at Chanute, Kan.
   Wednesday morning's low for the Lower 48 states was 23 degrees
at Yellowstone, Wyo.
   Corpus Christi, Texas, hit a record 94 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 33 and
snowing at McCall, Idaho, to 97 degrees at Beeville, Texas.

   Here, at a glance, are the latest developments in the Persian
Gulf crisis:
   
   Saddam Hussein made his first known visit to the oil-rich
neighbor he conquered two months ago, meeting Iraqi troops and
military commanders in occupied Kuwait on Wednesday.
   The Iraqi News gency said Saddam toured the streets of Kuwait,
which ``appeared flourishing after its return to the mother
homeland.'' Kuwait City ``glittered with pride'' at Saddam's visit,
said the news agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   ---
   Amnesty International issued a report saying that Iraqi troops
in Kuwait have tortured and executed scores of people, some for
refusing to display pictures of Saddam. The international human
rights group said the report was based on information gathered by
two representatives who interviewed witnesses and victims in
Bahrain.
   Refugees fleeing Kuwait have said stores and shops have been
pillaged, and that Iraq is doing its best to dismantle Kuwaiti
institutions. They reported summary executions of resistance
fighters.
   ---
   A Palestinian guerrilla leader, Abul Abbas, on Wednesday warned
of retaliation against U.S. targets if Iraqi planes were hit with
weapons under the U.N. air embargo against Iraq.
   In a statement published by Baghdad's official al-Jumhuriya
daily, Abbas called the air embargo ``the operation of air piracy
by one state against another to serve its narrow-minded
interests.''
   ---
   Yevgeny Primakov, a close adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, visited Amman. He said he had brought a letter for King
Hussein that concerns ``efforts to find a settlement for the gulf
crisis and other Mideast problems.'' The Soviet delegation was
scheduled to fly to Baghdad on Thursday to meet with Iraqi
officials.
   ---
   Nine Frenchmen held hostage in Iraq were released in Baghdad and
arrived in Jordan with the private French group that secured their
release. Meanwhile, French president Francois Mitterrand flew to
the Persian Gulf for a two-day visit during which he planned to
meet regional leaders and inspect French troops. His first stop was
the United Arab Emirates' capital of Abu Dhabi.
   ---
   On the second day of his weeklong Middle East visit, Japanese
Premier Toshiku Kaifu Wednesday said his country would make ``more
and stronger efforts'' to find a peaceful way out of the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   On Thursday, he will meet in Amman with Iraq's vice president,
Taha Yassin Ramadan. Japan's Foreign Office said the Iraqis
requested the meeting with Kaifu and Japan accepted.

   Thousands of leftist radicals marched through
central Berlin on Wednesday, throwing stones, smashing windows and
pelting police with paint to express their opposition to German
unity.
   More than 20,000 people marched from a square in the western
part of the city to a large square in the east side.
   The theme of the march was that united Germany was experiencing
a rise in nationalism and racism. Many of the radicals were
demanding that the German state be abolished entirely.
   The newly combined Berlin police force dispatched hundreds of
law enforcement officials to Alexanderplatz, the large square east
of the Brandenburg gate that is a favorite place for protests.
   About 15 to 20 youths broke off from the main group and rampaged
through Alexanderplatz. They pummeled passers-by and demolished an
outdoor stand selling clothing.
   Thousands of riot police flanked the protest march and sealed
off an adjacent street where a large group was chanting, ``Germany
go away,'' ``Germany go to pieces, ``Never again Germany.''
   The group was prevented form entering Alexanderplatz where huge
festivities were going on to celebrate the unification of the two
German states.
   The protesters, most of them members of West Berlin's radical
left-wing scene, rallied into the evening at a large square across
the Alexanderplatz.
   Several protesters scaled flagpoles at the square and removed
the newly unfurled West German flags that replaced East Germany's
flag, and hoisted the red-and-black flag of the anarchist movement
and the former Communist flag of East Germany.
   Several windows were smashed and police used tear gas against
the agitators, who melted away into the crowd of revelers
celebrating German unity.

<HEAD>EPA Says There's Little Decline in Industry Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Requirements that industry report toxic
chemical releases will force polluters to reduce emissions, but the
first two years of data show little decline in pollution, the
Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday.
   The EPA, in an analysis of the toxic inventory reports for 1987
and 1988, said that while factories reported a 10 percent
statistical drop in toxic chemical releases the largest part of the
decline was from changes in reporting.
   For example, some materials that are normally recycled were
reported as releases in 1987 but not in 1988. For the facilities
reporting the largest decline in pollution between the two years,
at least two-thirds of the reduction was ``due to paper changes.''
   The EPA said spot checks showed the industry reports were
generally accurate, but that thousands of facilities may still not
be reporting releases as required by law.
   The EPA estimated that in 1987 as many as one-third of the
companies, or about 10,000, that were required to make reports
failed to do so. The chemical industry had the highest reporting
record with 88 percent compliance, while the apparel, printing and
publishing industries had the lowest compliance record, the agency
said.
   Although the agency does not have compliance data for 1988, EPA
and industry officials suggested compliance was likely to be
greater because 1987 was the first year the reporting law went into
effect and some companies may not have been aware of it.
   The findings were among an array of conclusions reached by EPA
officials in an analysis of two toxic chemical release statistics
previously made public.
   Industry, according to the reports submitted to the EPA and
announced in April, released nearly 4.6 billion pounds of toxic
chemicals into the air, water and on land in 1988.
   In 1987, the first year the figures were compiled, the total was
nearly 5 billion pounds.
   Among the other EPA conclusions, some of which had been reported
previously, were:
   -Texas and Louisiana accounted for nearly a fourth of all toxic
releases and transfers of toxic materials to disposal sites and 50
facilities accounted for 36 percent of these chemicals.
   -Cancer-causing chemicals account for about 8 percent of the
total. The most frequently released carcinogen - 115 million pounds
in 1988 - was dichloromethane, used as an industrial solvent and
paint stripper.
   -Among the 25 chemicals most widely emitted, seven are
considered to be ``highly toxic.'' They are ammonia, carbon
disulfide, chlorine, zinc, copper, manganese and zinc compounds.
   -Five percent more facilities submitted toxic release data in
1988 and in 1987, mainly because more plants came under the
jurisdiction of the reporting law in 1988. A total of 19,763
indstrial plants submitted reports. The requirement covers plants
emitting at least 50,000 pounds of chemicals.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said he expects that the
annual publication of toxic release data will push polluters to
reduce toxic chemical releases. The 1989 reports have not been
tabulated.
   ``These data, which are available to any citizen, should be
considered to be among the most important weapons in efforts to
combat pollution,'' Reilly said.
   A number of chemical companies, including some of the nation's
largest, have said they are pushing for dramatic reductions in
toxic releases in the coming years. Clean air legislation nearing
completion in Congress also requires such reductions.

   Serbs manning a roadblock wounded
two police near Knin, a town in the center of the conflict between
Serbs and Croats, Yugoslavia's two largest ethnic groups, Tanjug
news agency said Wednesday.
   Serb leaders are threatening to use force and to ally themselves
with Serbs in other republics if Croatia doesn't give in to their
demands for full autonomy, developments that could plunge this
volatile Balkan nation into a civil war.
   In Slovenia, to the north, officials said they would ``use all
means'' to resist any move by the Yugoslav military to regain
command over the region's home guard.
   Tens of thousands of Slovene reservists were available to
prevent any attempt by Yugoslav army units to reassert federal
control, Janez Jansa, Slovenia's defense minister, told reporters
in the state capital of Ljubljana.
   The Slovenian legislature voted last week to transfer the
state's Territorial Defense militia - up to now under federal
command - to local authorities.
   Yugoslavia's state presidency said Monday it would block
Slovenia's move and ordered the federal military to resist any
changes in the command structure of Slovenia's home guard.
   The collective presidency, made up of representatives from each
of the country's six republics and two provinces, is the highest
body in the land and also is in charge of the armed forces.
   It demanded on Tuesday that Croatia withdraw its special
riot-police units from towns where members of the Serb minority
seized an estimated 500 automatic weapons and handguns from police
armories.
   Tanjug quoted the presidency as saying, ``The situation in many
areas with a mixed national population has seriously deteriorated .
. . and is threatening to result in intranationalist conflicts with
tragic consequences.''
   The Knin shooting came when two policemen were stopped late
Tuesday night at a roadblock about three miles from Knin, about 125
miles south of Zagreb.
   The rifle-toting civilian guards demanded that the officers
surrender arms; the police refused; as they tried to leave, the
guards fired and wounded them, Tanjug said. It reported the
injuries were not life-threatening.
   An explosion in Knin late Tuesday wrecked a Croatian news stand,
a witness reported. No one was injured.
   Serbia is Yugoslavia's largest republic, and Croatia the
second-largest.
   The rivalry between Serbs and Croats dates from Yugoslavia's
founding in 1918 and heightened dramatically after the center-right
government ousted Communists last spring in Croatia's first free
elections in over 45 years.
   The Serbs accuse the new government in Zagreb of discriminating
against them. The Croatian government says the unrest was
orchestrated by Communist-governed Serbia to undermine democracy in
Croatia and rally popular support for Serbia's hardline leaders.
   Serbs comprise about 10 percent of Croatia's 5 million people.
   Serbia's 14 main opposition parties said Wednesday they would
boycott the region's first free elections in more than 50 years
unless the Communists agreed to equal access to the state-run news
media and other conditions.
   ``If they don't want Serbia to remain a sad, single-party
dictatorship in today's democratic Europe'' the Communists should
call off elections scheduled for Dec. 9, said a statement released
by the opposition coalition.
   The Communists should then negotiate with the opposition and a
democratic electoral law would follow, the statement said.

   An environmental group charged Wednesday that
oil companies are destroying Ecuador's rain forests with toxic
waste discharges and oil pipeline spills amounting to more than was
spilled from the Exxon Valdez.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council especially criticized
Texaco Inc. and asked it to establish a $50 million fund to
undertake emergency cleanups and establish environmental controls
to prevent further contamination of the forests.
   ``The company bears at a minimum a moral responsibility to make
appropriate reparations,'' the council said in a report on its
18-month on-site investigation of the impact of oil development on
Ecuador's 3.1 million acres of tropical rain forest.
   Texaco spokesman Dave Dixon said the company was not given a
copy of the report and therefore could not comment on specific
charges. But, he added, ``In all its operations, Texaco's policy is
to operate in accordance with the highest standards of
environmental conservation.''
   The report was released at a news conference attended by Robert
F. Kennedy Jr., an attorney for the group who traveled to Ecuador
in July.
   ``We saw things that in 20 years of going to Latin America I
have never seen and (in) seven years of practicing environmental
law in this state and being involved in some of the worst toxic
sites in the state I have never seen,'' Kennedy said.
   In contaminated areas of the forests ``children have pus coming
out of their eyes from bathing in streams, animals are dead ...
adults have rashes covering their bodies,'' he said.
   The Ecuadoran government has recorded about 30 major oil spills
from the Trans-Ecuadorian pipeline from 1972 until October 1989,
with an estimated loss of 16.8 million gallons of oil, according to
the natural resources council. During that time, the pipeline was
operated by Texaco, it said.
   The Exxon Valdez spilled about 10.8 million gallons of oil into
the Prince William Sound in Alaska.
   The pipeline is particularly vulnerable to spills because it
crosses a major Andean fault. In March 1987, earthquakes caused
some 5.9 million gallons of oil to spew into the Coca River.
   Ecuador's rain forests also are being contaminated by poisonous
wastes from hundreds of oil wells in the region, the environmental
group charged. More than 4 million gallons of these wastes are
dumped untreated into unlined pits every day and seep into streams
and aquifers, it said.
   Cleanup efforts are primitive, at best, according to the
council.
   Kennedy said he saw inhabitants of the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve
cleaning up an oil spill by using their bare hands to scoop oil
into plastic bags, which were then buried in pits.
   The council is the first environmental group to examine the
impact of oil development on rain forests, said S. Jacob Scherr,
director of the council's international program. Traditionally, he
said, environmentalists have worried about the destruction of
tropical forests by slash-and-burn farmers, logging, mining and
road building.
   The environmental group also urged Conoco, a subsidiary of Du
Pont Co., to cancel its plans to drill oil in the region, saying it
``would risk unnecessary and irreparable injury to the indigenous
Huaorani people.''
   Ed Davies, president and general manager of Conoco Ecuador, said
in a telephone interview from Quito, Ecuador, that the company was
working closely with the Huaorani, who number only 1,580, to ensure
the oil development does not have a negative impact on them.

   An all-white jury Wednesday
convicted a record store owner of obscenity for selling a sexually
explicit album by the black rap group 2 Live Crew that had been
banned by a federal judge.
   The panel of five women and one man took only 2{ hours to return
the verdict against Charles Freeman, 31. The misdemeanor conviction
carries a possible one-year jail sentence and $1,000 fine. Broward
County Judge Paul Backman set sentencing for Nov. 2.
   ``I'm absolutely stunned by the verdict,'' defense attorney
Bruce Rogow said.
   Freeman denounced the jurors as unfair and ignorant of the black
community. The departing jurors had no comment.
   ``I felt that the jury paid very close attention to the
evidence,'' said prosecutor Leslie Robson. ``They came back with a
verdict that spoke the truth.''
   The Miami-based rap group and its album ``As Nasty as They Wanna
Be'' have been at the center of a First Amendment dispute since
June 6, when a Fort Lauderdale federal judge ruled their lyrics
obscene. The lyrics have been criticized as promoting violence
against women.
   The federal judge's ruling banned the sale of the album in three
south Florida counties, but opened a flood of legal cases around
the country against the album. Shortly after the decision sales of
the 2-year-old album nationwide approached 2 million.
   ``It's the first time in (U.S.) musical history that a piece of
work has been found to be obscene,'' said Trish Heimers,
spokeswoman for the Recording Industry Association of America, a
Washington-based trade association for U.S. record companies.
``There are not small steps toward censorship, and I would most
certainly characterize this as censorship.''
   In February, a record store owner in Alexander City, Ala., was
acquitted of obscenity for selling the album.
   ``Is this America?'' asked Robyn Blumner, executive director of
the state American Civil Liberties Union chapter. ``These things
happen in totalitarian societies where certain ideas may not be
expressed upon penalty of law.''
   Broward Sheriff Nick Navarro, who led the case, greeted the
verdict by saying the system worked: ``This was never a case of
censorship but rather one man flouting the law. The First Amendment
is alive and well.''
   And Donald Wildmon, founder of the conservative American Family
Association based in Tupelo, Miss., saw the conviction as a sign of
a national trend against obscenity and pornography: ``There's
definitely a shift in attitudes in America about this kind of
trash.''
   Freeman, who is black, was arrested two days after the ruling
when he sold the album to undercover police officers at his E-C
record store in Fort Lauderdale.
   Three members of the rap group later were charged with
performing obscene material at a nightclub show in nearby
Hollywood. Their trial is set Oct. 9.
   Rogow, who also represents the band members, promised an appeal
on grounds that the jury pool did not represent the community and
that evidence of adult videotapes and magazines available in the
county was improperly excluded.
   ``What you have is a jury that could not represent all of
Broward County,'' he said. ``Certainly it was not a cross-section
of the county.''
   The jury ``doesn't represent my community,'' Freemanshouted to
reporters as he left the courthouse. ``It's unfair. The jury was
all white. They don't know where E-C Records is. They don't know a
god-damned thing about the ghetto.''
   2 Live Crew was scheduled to perform Wednesday night at a club
in Niagara Falls, N.Y.
   David Hobbs, the band's disc jockey, said the controversy would
not force the group to alter its style. ``We feel that we have to
do what we have to do, and that's make the same records that we've
been making,'' Hobbs said.
   ``If it wouldn't have been us, it would have been somebody
else,'' Hobbs said at a news conference. ``Someone's always going
to be the target. It just happened to get pointed at our
direction.''
   Jury instructions followed a U.S. Supreme Court standard saying
material could be found obscene if it has no artistic merit and
appeals solely to prurient interests. A tape of the disputed record
was played for the jury.
   ``Obscenity is what this is,'' prosecutor Robson said, waving a
cassette tape before the jury in her closing arguments.
   The trial was the first jury test of U.S. District Judge Jose
Gonzalez's ruling that the group's raunchy lyrics were obscene.
   Alternate juror Sheryl Salomon, who sat through the 2{-day trial
but was not needed for deliberations, said after her dismissal that
she would have acquitted Freeman.
   ``I was very offended by it, especially the lyrics, but I have
to question whether there is no artistic value,'' she said. ``It's
music, it's still music.
   Legal arguments focused on First Amendment free-speech
protection, but race has been an underlying issue.
   Defense attorneys objected to the makeup of the 35-member jury
pool, which included only one black whose name was not picked when
a dozen names were drawn at random as the final group of
prospective jurors.
   ``One person's vulgarity is another person's art,'' Rogow said.
``It's never easy living with the First Amendment. A person can say
terrible things violently against the government, against the
family, against women and against men, and it's all within the
parameters of the First Amendment.''
   ``The First Amendment doesn't mean you can say what you want to
whom you want and when you want because there's responsibilities
along with those rights,'' Robson said. ``One of the things you
can't do is you can't sell obscene material.''

<HEAD>Belgian Military Aid Sought to Battle Rebel Invasion</HEAD>

   The president of Rwanda on Wednesday asked
the nation's former colonial ruler for military aid to help battle
an invasion led by refugees based in neighboring Uganda.
   A Belgian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said officials were
studying the plea from President Juvenal Habyarimana, who stopped
in Brussels en route from New York.
   Belgium has about 20 military advisers in Rwanda and more than
1,600 Belgians live there. The central African nation gained its
independence from Belgium in 1962.
   The invasion began Sunday, led by Fred Rwigyema, a member of
Rwanda's Tutsi ethnic group who has become the deputy commander of
Uganda's army since being exiled there years ago.
   The Tutsi group lost to the rival Hutu group in a power struggle
about 30 years ago. An estimated 87,000 Tutsi refugees live in
southwestern Uganda and some have gained senior posts in the
Ugandan government, especially the army.
   Rwandese troops Wednesday appeared to halt the advance of the
rebel force seeking to overthrow the government, said a Western
diplomat in Rwanda's capital of Kigali.
   The diplomat said the rebel fighters, which include deserters
from the Ugandan army, was estimated at 1,500. Another diplomat, at
the U.S. embassy, put the force at from 5,000 to 10,000. Rwanda, a
nation of 7.2 million, has an army of 5,000 troops.
   The rebel advance stalled around Gabiro and Gatsibo, two border
towns about 70 miles northeast of the capital and about 25 miles
inside Rwanda, the diplomats said.
   The diplomat said the government mobilized all reservists
Tuesday night and the Rwandese were ``fighting for survival.''
   A Uganda army spokesman in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, said
the invaders killed 12 Rwandese soldiers at the border Monday.
   U.S. Embassy officials began moving about 200 Americans out of
the fighting region Wednesday.
   Kigali was quiet except for additional troops guarding strategic
buildings. Soldiers also manned roadblocks on highways leading into
the city.
   ``The shops are open. The airport is open, and people are
working in government offices,'' said the U.S. embassy spokesman.
   Ugandan authorities issued a statement condemning ``vehemently
this act by the refugees who have enjoyed Uganda's hospitality for
30 years.''
   President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda was returning Wednesday from
New York after attending a U.N.-sponsored summit on children.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein toured the
streets of Kuwait City on Wednesday and visited with soldiers who
promised to defend the invaded country against ``all evil
attempts'' to dislodge them.
   In his first reported visit to occupied Kuwait, Saddam found a
capital that ``glittered with pride'' at his presence, the official
Iraqi News Agency said, monitored in Nicosia.
   Saddam toured the streets of Kuwait, which ``appeared
flourishing after its return to the mother homeland.'' Saddam has
annexed Kuwait and proclaimed it Iraq's 19th province.
   The visit appeared to be an effort to counter reports of turmoil
overtaking the city since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion.
   ``On his arrival at the center of the city of Kuwait, the
president presided over two meetings of the military commanders and
a number of officials attended by Mr. Ali Hassan Al-Majeed,
minister of the local administration,'' the Iraqi News Agency said.
   Al-Majeed, a cousin of Saddam, has Cabinet rank as minister of
local governments. Maintaining longtime links with Iraq's secret
police, he oversaw Iraq's poison-gas attacks on ethnic Kurds in the
north of the country in the fall of 1988 that reportedly killed
thousands of people.
   The news agency said that after the meetings with the officials,
Saddam ``made a tour during which he met a number of units of the
Iraqi brave armed forces and talked to the fighters.''
   The troops confirmed to Saddam ``their ever-readiness for
sacrifice for Iraq and the Arab nation and defeating all evil
attempts to desecrate our sacred land,'' the news agency said.
   Refugees fleeing Kuwait have said that stores and shops have
been pillaged. There have been reports of summary executions of
resistance fighters. Many refugees said they had feared to leave
their homes.
   President Bush has cited such reports in saying that the United
Nations might have to provide more action to dislodge Iraq if
economic sanctions fail to do so. Military action has been
suggested.
   The presidential visit Wednesday also may be construed in the
West as an effort by Saddam to stake a further claim on Kuwait.
Western leaders have said repeatedly that Iraq must withdraw Kuwait
before any serious dialogue can begin.

<TEXT>
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne
Feinstein criticized Sen. Pete Wilson on Wednesday for failing to
vote on the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice David Souter.
   She described the Souter vote as ``the most critical and
important judicial appointment of the decade'' and said it was
arrogant of her Republican opponent to skip that and other major
Senate votes. Wilson was the only senator who missed the Souter
vote.
   His vote wouldn't have made any difference in Souter's 90-9
confirmation, Wilson said in explaining why he didn't interrupt his
campaigning in California to return to Washington on Tuesday.
   Wilson and Feinstein have their first televised debate Sunday.
   Wilson also was criticized by Robert Fertik, president of
Democrats for Choice, a White Plains, N.Y.-based organization whose
supporters include 18 members of Congress.
   ``Senator Wilson says he's an unwavering supporter of abortion
rights,'' said Fertik. ``On the most important abortion rights vote
of the decade, he didn't even bother to show up.'' Fertik predicted
Souter will provide the crucial fifth vote to overturn Roe v. Wade,
the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.
   Wilson said there is a good chance he might not be present for
the expected vote on the deficit reduction compromise of President
Bush and congressional leaders.
   Wilson and Feinstein refused to take a stand on the deficit
reduction proposal.
   Wilson said it's ``undoubtedly true'' that it's the best plan
that can be negotiated at this time, but added that he is ``not
crazy about it'' because of the tax increases.
   Wilson said he would stay in California campaigning and
preparing for the debate unless his vote is essential.
   Feinstein described the budget plan as ``the most significant
deficit reduction program in a decade.''
   ``On the other hand ... it's protecting the rich'' by skewing
tax increases to hit the middle class hardest,'' she added.

   Conservatives won or led many
congressional and gubernatorial elections in an apparent vote of
support for rightist President Fernando Collor de Mello, according
to exit polls Wednesday.
   Official ballot counting did not begin until polls closed at 5
p.m. (4 p.m. EDT). But voter surveys showed rightists had captured
at least eight of 27 gubernatorial races and a majority of Senate
and House seats in the vote.
   The Liberal Front Party, which had elected just one governor in
the 1985 election, won in five states. Collor's tiny National
Reconstruction Party made gains across the country, including
Collor's home state of Alagoas in northern Brazil.
   Besides the governorships in all 26 states and the capital
district of Brasilia, all 503 seats in the federal House of
Representatives and 31 of 81 Senate posts were at stake in the
elections, which come five years after the end of Brazil's 19-year
military dictatorship.
   Runoffs will be held Nov. 25 if no gubernatorial candidate
receives 50 percent of the valid votes. A majority is not required
in other races.
   In Sao Paulo, the top gubernatorial electoral prize with almostof the
Democratic Workers Party won easily in Rio
de Janeiro with 57 percent, and Ciro Gomes of the Brazilian Social
Democracy Party took a majority in the northern state of Ceara.
   The militant Workers Party, which was seen as the major rising
force in Brazilian politics last year, faded dramatically and was
near the lead only in the far-western Amazon state of Acre. A
runoff there is likely.
   Early polls indicated about 12 percent of the 83 million
registered voters - from the steamy Amazon to the industrialized
southeast - would cast blank ballots to protest Collor's economic
austerity policies.
   ``Politicians have no credibility,'' said Carlos Alberto Gomes,
32, who cast a blank ballot in Rio's middle-class district of
Flamengo. ``They promise the world and deliver nothing.''
   Sociologist Helio Jaguaribe said voters have ``stopped believing
in politicians and lost hope in the renovation of the political
class.''
   The balloting is the first since a December 1989 vote made
Collor the country's first freely-elected president in 29 years.
   Final results will not be known for more than a week. In remote
areas, ballots must be delivered to regional electoral centers by
muleback and canoe, and the vote count is largely done manually.
   The new congress will convene in February 1991 while the new
governors take office in March.
   Thousands of army troops were on the street to ensure order in
about 270 of the country's 4,500 counties. Most were posted in
backwoods towns where violence has flared between local political
factions.
   Soldiers also were stationed in the northeastern city of Recife,
capital of Pernambuco state. Conservative Joaquim Francisco was
matched against leftist Jarbas Vasconcelos in a hotly disputed race
for governor.
   Federal police chief Romeo Tuma reported at midday the elections
were taking place in a climate of ``total tranquility throughout
the country.''
   Voting is obligatory for Brazilians 18 to 69. Those who fail to
do so pay a $7 fine and are subjected to bureaucratic hassles.
Sixteen- and 17-year-olds can also vote but it is not mandatory.

   Foreign embassies trying to hold out in
Kuwait are caving in one by one to Iraq's siege tactics, and one
European foreign minister said he doubted any foreign missions
could remain beyond this week.
   After invading Kuwait, Iraq ordered the embassies closed and
many shut down a few weeks after the Aug. 24 deadline.
   But many countries, including the United States and Britain,
have defied the order and kept their embassies open with skeletal
staffs.
   Sixteen die-hard embassies remain open despite tough conditions.
Most have had their electricity and water cut, and many are
surrounded by Iraqi soldiers and tanks, their communications and
food lines severed.
   Bowing to the hardships, Spain and South Korea last week
withdrew their remaining diplomats from Kuwait City.
   Spain gave as its reason the superior power of Iraq's army,
which surrounded the Spanish Embassy in the days prior to the
charge d'affaires' departure Thursday. Madrid nevertheless said it
considers its embassy open in principle and rejects Iraq's
annexation of Kuwait.
   The South Korean Foreign Ministry said it ``temporarily'' closed
its embassy because of the ``deteriorated situation.''
   Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens said Saturday in New York
that most European embassies still open in Kuwait would probably
have to close this week.
   There are fewer than 10 diplomats at the U.S. Embassy, according
to a State Department official who refused to go into more detail.
   The besieged Americans are cut off but have enough food and
water, said the official. He would not estimate how long they can
hold out ``under the very trying circumstances.''
   He would not comment on earlier reports that the Americans were
using the embassy swimming pool for drinking water.
   The British Embassy has only four staff remaining including the
ambassador, but two will be leaving soon via Baghdad to conserve
supplies for the other two, according to a Foreign Office
spokesman.
   He declined to comment on the food supply, although he said
staff at the embassy are ``in good spirits.'' Eyskens said last
week that the British Embassy appeared to have more plentiful
supplies than others in Kuwait.
   The French have about a half-dozen diplomats in Kuwait,
according to the Foreign Ministry in Paris.
   ``There's no problem. We're holding on,'' a spokeman said
simply. The French government has been reluctant to give details
about French citizens who remain in Kuwait. ``They have good
morale, and there hasn't been any particular problem recently,''
the spokesman said.
   Italy has only two diplomats in Kuwait who are surviving ``with
their supplies ... . They eat canned food,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vittorio Surdo said Tuesday. He said morale was high but
``the pressure is increasing.''
   The Belgian ambassador and his chief aide, along with a
non-diplomatic Belgian couple and their three children in the
Belgian Embassy are all right but their food and water are running
low.
   A Foreign Ministry source said he assumed some supplies were
getting to the embassy but it was becoming increasingly difficult,
probably forcing the embassy to close soon.
   The Dutch may be the best off among the Europeans. ``There's
lots of everything,'' including food and drink, and no Iraqi
soldiers outside the mission, a government spokeswoman said
Tuesday. The ministry knows of no ``unusual hardships,'' she said.
   The five Gulf Cooperation Council countries besides Kuwait -
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman - have
refused the Iraqi order to close their embassies, insisting that
their diplomats remain accredited to the deposed government of
Kuwait.
   All but the Saudi Arabian missions are known to be staffed, but
diplomatic sources in the Persian Gulf said this week that
low-ranking Saudi diplomats are there to underscore Saudi support
for Kuwait.
   The Philippine Embassy was reported two weeks ago by a
Philippine journalist who visited Kuwait to be crammed with some
3,000 nationals caught when Iraqi troops swarmed into the oil-rich
emirate. Foreign Ministry officials in Manila say they do not know
how many remain, but say the embassy still has electricity and
water.
   Indonesia's embassy is not closed, although Jakarta has
withdrawn its diplomats and left the building under the care of a
local guardian whose food comes from Jordan or from the Indonesian
Embassy in Baghdad, according to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry.
   Other embassies that have refused the order to close include
Canada, Luxembourg, Senegaland Germany.
   Kuwait's Cabinet-in-exile, operating out of Saudi Arabia, issued
a statement Tuesday condemning Baghdad for its treatment of
embassies and diplomats and praising the ``honorable stand'' of
those who remained.

   A band of about 20 former Contra
rebels attacked a police post in northern Nicaragua and at least
four rebels were killed and nine wounded, the Interior Ministry
said Wednesday.
   One policeman also was wounded in the Tuesday raid at Waslala,
125 miles north of Managua, ministry spokesman Frank Cesar said.
   He said the government assigned a commission to investigate,
including observers from the Organization of American States,
United Nations and Central American.
   There have been several attacks recently by intransigent
Contras, most notably at Sandinista cooperative farms.
   People living in the region said by telephone that the former
rebels managed to take over the station and forced about 15 police
to take refuge in Sandinista army installations. The residents said
a five-member military police commission was taken hostage briefly.
   Cesar said he had no information on that.
   Another ministry source said about 100 former Contras surrounded
La Dalia, another town in the region, early Wednesday.
   Most of the U.S.-backed Contras turned in their weapons and left
camps on the Honduran side of the border under an agreement on
transition of power from the leftist Sandinistas to President
Violeta Chamorro.
   Mrs. Chamorro defeated incumbent President Daniel Ortega in Feb.
25 elections. She took office April 25.
   The government said 30,000 people were killed and 25,000 wounded
during nearly nine years of civil war.
   Former Contras returning to Nicaragua have complained that the
Chamorro government isn't fulfilling promises of creating
development centers for them.
   The cooperative farms they invaded were created during the 10
years of Sandinista government. Most have have a small school,
health center and some farm equipment. Sandinistas expropriated
much of the land from wealthy landowners.
   Former rebels have been allowed to live at some Sandinista
cooperatives but have been rejected at others.

   A bus carrying more than 55 elderly Italian
tourists plunged from a rain-slicked bridge Wednesday, killing 16
people and injuring about 30, authorities said.
   The bus fell about 100 feet, said highway police near Ovada,
about 60 miles southwest of Milan.
   The bus company told the Italian news agency ANSA the accident
may have occurred because the 31-year-old driver, who died in the
crash, suffered a sudden, unspecified illness.
   An official in Ovada said bad weather may have been the cause.
   ``At the moment of the accident, it was raining cats and dogs,''
he said. ``The road was really wet.''
   The bus was carrying elderly people from the coastal town of
Albissola to Novara, in northern Italy.

   The music industry and civil libertarians cried ``Censorship!''
after a Florida store owner was convicted for selling an album by 2
Live Crew, the first time a U.S. jury has deemed a musical
recording obscene.
   ``If the people who run the state aren't careful, Florida in the
'90s will become to rock 'n' roll what Mississippi was to civil
rights in the '60s,'' said veteran rap publicist Bill Adler of
Rhyme and Reason Productions in New York City.
   ``Is this America?'' asked Robyn Blumner, executive director of
the state American Civil Liberties Union chapter. ``These things
happen in totalitarian societies where certain ideas may not be
expressed upon penalty of law.''
   An all-white jury convicted Fort Lauderdale record store owner
Charles Freeman, 31, of obscenity Wednesday for selling the album
``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' by the black, Miami-based rap group
on June 8. Two days earlier, a federal judge in Broward County
ruled their lyrics obscene and banned the sale of the album in
Broward and two other Florida counties.
   ``It's the first time in (U.S.) musical history that a piece of
work has been found to be obscene,'' said Trish Heimers,
spokeswoman for the Recording Industry Association of American, a
Washington-based trade association for U.S. record companies.
   ``There are not small steps toward censorship, and I would most
certainly characterize this as censorship,'' she said.
   Band members appeared at a news conference before their show at
a Niagara Falls, N.Y., nightclub but they would not discuss the
case or their own upcoming obscenity trial in Miami in any detail.
   ``We feel that we have to do what we have to do, and that's make
the same records that we've been making,'' said David Hobbs, the
group's disc jockey. ``That's it,'' he said.
   Hobbs, who spoke for the group, said the musicians feel they
were just a convenient foil for the anti-obscenity movement.
   ``If it wouldn't have been us, it would have been somebody
else,'' he said. ``Someone's always going to be the target. It just
happened to get pointed in our direction.''
   The group's lyrics include sexually explicit language and have
been criticized as promoting violence against women, a charge Hobbs
rejected. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that material could be
found obscene if it has no artistic merit and appeals solely to
prurient interests.
   Broward Sheriff Nick Navarro, who led the prosecution case,
greeted the verdict by saying the system worked: ``This was never a
case of censorship but rather one man flouting the law. The First
Amendment is alive and well.''
   Donald Wildmon, founder of the conservative American Family
Association based in Tupelo, Miss., saw the conviction as a sign of
a national trend against obscenity and pornography: ``There's
definitely a shift in attitudes in America about this kind of
trash.''
   Heimers argued that a recording should be judged for both
musical and lyrical content, and ``by the very nature of having
both, it can't be deemed as obscene. The music, no matter what the
lyrics, is not without artistic value.''
   She said the music industry was prepared to assist Freeman with
financial and legal help. Freeman's lawyer promised to appeal the
misdemeanor conviction, which carries a possible one-year jail
sentence and $1,000 fine.
   ``The precedent has been set that it's OK to find music obscene
and that is wrong,'' Heimers said. ``Any country that allows the
KKK (Ku Klux Klan) to have a TV show on public access should have
the 2 Live Crew available.''
   ``Obviously we're shocked and dismayed over many elements of the
decision, and there's not much in life that shocks me,'' said
Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts
&amp; Sciences in Burbank, Calif.
   Greene criticized ``the extremely narrow view that the judge and
jury exhibited'' in convicting Freeman and questioned ``how an
all-white, predominantly female jury can determine what does and
does not constitute artistic merit in a primarily inner-city, black
music form.''
   ``Today the victim is a little guy who sells records, but we're
sure the target is a black form of music and freedom of
expression,'' Greene said.

<HEAD>Britain Will Review Asylum Claims of Undocumented Passengers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain on Wednesday granted temporary admission
to 156 political asylum seekers who arrived without warning or
travel documents aboard a cargo plane from Syria, the Home Office
reported.
   A Gatwick airport spokeswoman said she believed the passengers,
including 61 children, were Kurds from Iraq. The Home Office would
only say they ``are of Middle Eastern origin.''
   A Home Office statement said the arrivals would stay with
friends and relatives while their claims for asylum are considered
over the next few months. The group arrived Tuesday night aboard an
Egyptian ZAS airline DC-9 from the Syrian capital of Damascus.
   Political asylum applicants must ``usually have to prove they
face persecution at home,'' said the statement.
   Since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Britain has introduced
measures to restrict entry of Iraqis, but the refugees' claims will
be reviewed according to United Nations policies, said a Home
Office spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has used chemical weapons against
Kurds in northern Iraq seeking independence. The Kurdish rebellion
flared during Iraq's eight-year war with Iran.
   None of those on the cargo plane had travel documents. The group
was initially detained in a lounge at Gatwick, about 25 miles south
of London.
   The Home Office said ZAS was fined $290,000 for transporting
passengers without documents. The Gatwick spokeswoman said the
pilot informed Gatwick authorities of the passengers only 30
minutes before landing.
   The plane was on a scheduled cargo flight.
   British authorities detained the aircraft, but crew members were
allowed to book into a hotel, the spokeswoman said.
   On Tuesday, 76 Romanian vacationers applied for political asylum
in Britain. They were part of a group of more than 200 Romanians
who flew to Bristol in southern England on Saturday.
   The asylum-seekers told immigration officials there was still
repression in Romania despite the December revolution that toppled
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was later executed.

   The United States and the Soviet Union issued a
joint call Wednesday for a stronger United Nations role in
peace-making and crisis prevention.
   The statement reflected the growing cooperation between the two
superpowers in the Persian Gulf and in trying to ease tensions in
southern Africa and Central America.
   ``Serious problems still remain,'' the statement said. ``Our
search continues for workable soltuions to conflict and
instability'' in the gulf, the Middle East, Afghanistan and el
Salvador.''
   The superpowers affirmed the responsibility of all nations to
pay their assessments - something of an embarrassment for both. The
Soviets owe $137 million for contributions to peace-keeping forces
they have refuwsed to pay. The United States is $462 in arrears on
various payments and owes$62.5 million in current dues.
   The statement was issued shortly after Secretary of State James
A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
concluded an agreement in principle on a treaty to imposee ceilings
on NATO and Warsaw Pact conventional forces in Europe.
   ``The rapidly changing structure of international relations
requires a United Nations that, while remaining faithful to its
original purposes, can also respond flexibly and effectively to new
challenges as they occur,'' the statement said.
   As najor contributors to the U.N. budget, the superpowers called
for the elimination of duplication in programs while affirming
their responsibility to pay assessments.

   A.V. Gullette, a former Associated Press news

Wednesday following a short illness. He was 87.
   Gullette retired from the Republic in 1983, 30 years after
joining the Phoenix newspaper. He joined The Associated Press as a
reporter in 1937 in Albuquerque, N.M. He was named chief of bureau
there in 1947 and held that post when he resigned in 1952.
   He also had worked for the Omaha World-Herld, the Durango,
Colo., Herald, and the Gallup, N.M., Independent and the New Mexico

   In a column on his retirement at age 79, Republic writer Ira
Fine described him as ``one of the most energetic reporters in
Phoenix, churning out story after story and outdistancing some
colleagues who were decades younger than he.''
   ``But perhaps the best measure of Vince's impact is that he is

<TEXT>
   Liberal House Democrats rebelled Wednesday
against the $500-billion deficit-reduction package as President
Bush and congressional leaders pushed hard for the plan on the eve
of its first vote.
   Leading House Democrats and Republicans expressed confidence
that both sides would round up a majority of votes by Thursday,
when the full House plans to vote on an outline of the package of
tax boosts and spending cuts.
   ``That is my intuition, that when the vote comes there will be a
majority of both parties,'' said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash.
   But Bush, Foley and House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.,
worked furiously behind the scenes, meeting privately with
rank-and-file members and dispatching top lieutenants to do the
same. Democratic leadership aides, speaking privately, offered
conflicting assessments of how worried they might be about the
prospects.
   Democrats and Republicans figured on Wednesday nght they were
each 40 votes short of what they need and that a considerable
number of lawmakers remained uncommitted.
   A number of liberal Democrats said they would oppose the
proposal, complaining about its reliance on $60 billion in Medicare
cuts over five years and about the $11 billion in tax breaks it
contains for small businesses.
   ``To cut $60 billion from Medicare means a lot of low-income
elderly are going to be faced with difficult out-of-pocket
expenses,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. ``These people didn't
create the deficit.''
   After a day of White House lobbying Republicans, spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said the needed votes still were not in hand, and
declined to say how many votes the White House could muster.
   Bush kept close tabs on the results of lobbying efforts,
checking in with Fitzwater at the end of the day for a reading of
what the Congress members were telling reporters. Fitzwater told
him that ``most say they are considering it, they're listening and
they're sympathetic to the argument.''
   Twenty-seven more Republicans met with Bush at the White House,
the third straight day on which GOP lawmakers were summoned by the
president for his sales pitch. One White House official called the
operation the Bush administration's biggest lobbying effort yet.
   ``I was leaning against before. Now I'm firmly undecided,'' said
Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., after emerging from a meeting.
   Reps. Susan Molinari and Sherwood L. Boehlert, both R-N.Y., said
they were more inclined to vote with the president after the
meeting, but they wanted an unpopular 2 cents per gallon home
heating oil tax dropped.
   ``It was not any arm twisting. He based all his arguments on
facts,'' Molinari said.
   Bush cancelled a weekend trip to his Maine summer home to stay
on top of the budget issue.
   ``There comes a time when you have to simply make tough
decisions, give a little, to get what is best for the country,''
Bush told reporters in a message clearly designed for congressional
consumption.
   He urged members of Congress to vote for the package and then
``blame the president'' when they talk to voters.
   Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said at a
congressional hearing that he supports the deficit-reduction
package. Greenspan's views are important since supporters of the
plan are looking to the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to
offset any negative economic effects.
   The package would raise taxes on gasoline, home heating oil,
alcohol, tobacco, expensive cars and other luxury items, and on the
incomes of the wealthy.
   It would cut defense spending by close to $200 billion over the
next five years while reducing spending on benefit programs by $105
billion.
   The heating oil provision was being fought by members of
Congress from Northeastern states, some of whom said that keeping
it in could hurt support for the overall proposal.
   On Capitol Hill, liberal Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich., said he was
lobbied by a ``rather pessimistic'' sounding Foley.
   ``He was really laboring hard for my vote,'' said Kildee, who is
leaning against the plan.
   On the Republican side, No. 3 House GOP leader Jerry Lewis,
R-Calif., predicted ``a substantial victory'' for the plan. A
Republican aide said 50 of the House's 176 Republicans were now
committed to vote for the package.
   But opposition continued from conservatives unhappy with the
plan's $134 billion in new taxes and with spending cuts they
consider insufficient. Rep. Newt Gingrich, the chamber's No. 2
Republican leader and a leading opponent, who Tuesday said Bush's
lobbying would ensure the package's success, said Wednesday he was
no longer sure.
   Bush, nn a televised address Tuesday night, asked Americans to
tell their congressional representatives they supported the plan.
   But Gingrich, R-Ga., said, ``I've had members walk up to me and
say they've gotten so many phone calls from their districts against
the package that they don't know if they can stay with it.''
   Senate leaders have been more confident about the proposal's
prospects there. It was uncertain whether the Senate would vote
Thursday or Friday.
   Whatever the outcome in this week's preliminary votes, lawmakers
from both sides said they would not vote for the deficit-reduction
package itself - a vote expected in two weeks - unless changes were
made. At a morning meeting of House Democrats, leaders begged the
rank-and-file members to vote yes on Thursday and to see about
alterations after that.
   Among the skeptics is House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., who said the measure's Medicare cuts were
too deep and its tax breaks for companies too generous. Republicans
have said the tax benefits - such as one that allows deductions for
some money invested in small companies - would help create jobs.
   ``I can see a tax shelter boom, and the only employment that
will I think be created is a boom in tax-shelter packaging,'' said
Rostenkowski.
   Rostenkowski, who said he has not decided how he will vote, is
one of the more influential members of the House. His committee
must approve the new levies, tax changes and spending cuts.

   Saddam Hussein on Wednesday made his first known visit to Kuwait
since Iraq captured its oil-rich neighbor Aug. 2. Another neighbor,
Iran, said it would keep out of any military confrontation between
Iraq and U.S.-led multinational forces in the region.
   Elsewhere in the Middle East, visiting French President Francois
Mitterrand, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiku Kaifu and Soviet envoy
Yevgeny Primakov all sought a peaceful solution to the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   But new terror threats emerged. Palestinian guerrilla leader
Abul Abbas warned he would attack U.S. aircraft if Iraqi planes
were hit with weapons as part of the U.N. air embargo against Iraq.
   In Washington, Bush administration officials told Congress Iraq
is likely to remain a long-term threat, and sales of billions of
dollars in U.S. weaponry to Saudi Arabia are crucial to a new
regional coalition to balance that menace.
   Iraq, facing an international force on its border with Saudi
Arabia after invading Kuwait, suddenly made peace with Iran last
month after eight years of war and two years of deadlocked peace
talks.
   Saddam wooed Iran to side with him. Tehran joined world demands
that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait, but also urged the expulsion of
foreign forces from the region.
   On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said on Tehran
TV that Iran wants a peaceful settlement and ``force should be the
last possible resort for solving this crisis, but Iran will not
participate in this in any way.''
   His remarks, monitored in Cyprus, indicated Iran was distancing
itself from Iraq, following suggestions it could circumvent a
U.S.-led embargo and send Iraq food and medicine. Reports from
Washington said Iraq also asked Tehran to help export its embargoed
oil.
   The London-based Amnesty International meanwhile issued a report
saying Iraqi occupation troops tortured and executed scores of
people in Kuwait, some for refusing to display pictures of Saddam.
   Refugees have said stores and shops were pillaged, and that Iraq
was out to dismantle Kuwaiti institutions. They reported summary
executions of resistance fighters.
   The Iraqi News Agency gave a different portrait. It said Saddam
toured the streets of Kuwait, which ``appeared flourishing after
its return to the mother homeland.''
   The news agency said Saddam met with Iraqi troops and presided
over two meetings of military commanders. Iraq has annexed the
emirate, declaring it Bahdad's 19th province.
   Kuwait city ``glittered with pride'' at Saddam's visit, said the
agency, monitored in Cyprus.
   Mitterrand flew to the Persian Gulf for a two-day visit during
which he planned to meet regional leaders and inspect French
troops.
   After he left Paris, the Defense Ministry announced France was
sending eight Mirage F1 fighter planes to Qatar to protect that
small country and the United Arab Emirates, its neighbor.
   His first stop was the Emirates' capital of Abu Dhabi.
   He reached there hours after nine French nationals held hostage
by Iraq flew out of Baghdad on an Iraqi plane and arrived in Amman,
Jordan, bound for Paris.
   They were accompanied by the chairman of the private French
group that arranged their release. Iraq is believed to still hold
about 300 other French nationals hostage, as well as thousands of
other Westerners.
   France now has 13,000 men plus a dozen warships in the gulf
region, the largest overseas deployment of French troops since the
Algerian war.
   Primakov, a Mideast expert and close adviser to Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, met King Hussein and other senior Jordanian
officials on Wednesday in Amman. He said he brought a letter for
Hussein that concerns ``efforts to find a settlement for the gulf
crisis and other Mideast problems.''
   The monarch has tried to play the role of mediator in the gulf
crisis.
   The Soviet delegation was due to fly to Baghdad Thursday for
talks with Iraqi officials. Late Wednesday, however, Iraqi Deputy
Premier Taha Yassin Ramadan arrived in Amman. It was not known if
this would change Primakov's plans.
   In New York, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said
the delegation would like to meet Saddam and that it also hoped to
arrange ``normal conditions'' for withdrawal of the 5,000 Soviet
citizens remaining in Iraq.
   Before Kuwazit was invaded, the Kremlin was Baghdad's main
weapons supplier and France was its next largest supplier. Moscow,
however, joined the United States in demanding Iraq's withdrawal
from Kuwait, which Baghdad invaded in a dispute over land, oil and
money.
   Japan's Kaifu also arrived in the Jordanian capital Wednesday
for talks with Hussein on aid to Jordan and on peaceful efforts to
solve the crisis.
   Kaifu met Wednesday night with Crown Prince Hassan, who briefed
him on the economic losses Jordan has sustained because of its
adherence to the U.N. embargo on Iraq, Jordan's largest trading
partner.
   Kaifu said earlier in the day, the second day of his weeklong
Middle East visit, that Japan would make ``more and stronger
efforts'' to find a peaceful way out of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   He is to meet in Amman on Thursday with Iraq's vice president,
Taha Yassin Ramadan. Shigeo Takanaka, deputy spokesman for Japan's
Foreign Office, said the Iraqis requested the meeting.
   He said Kaifu ``plans to impose on Mr. Ramadan the importance of
solving the crisis in the gulf in accordance with U.N. Security
Council resolutions.''
   The resolutions demand withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait,
restoration of its ousted government and freedom for the thousands
of Western hostages in both countries. They also impose air and sea
embargoes on Iraq.
   On Wednesday, Abul Abbas , who masterminded the 1985 hijacking
of the Italian liner Achille Lauro, called the air embargo ``the
operation of air piracy by one state against another to serve its
narrow-minded interests.''
   He acccused the United States of masterminding it and declared,
``We will not permit such legislation to be implemented against our
people and if any Iraqi aircraft is confronted by such air piracy
and should any damage be inflicted on Iraq's civil aviation, we
will retaliate.''
   The threats came in a statement published by Baghdad's official
al-Jumhuriya daily. Abul Abbas, who heads the extremist Palestine
Liberation Front, did not specify what action would be taken, but
he appeared to be talking about hijacking or bombing U.S.
airliners.

   Foreign ministers Wong Kan Seng of Singapore and Qian Qichen of
China sealed the agreement with a handshake and toast at a signing
ceremony at U.N. Headquarters.
   China contains more than a billion people. Singapore, an island
on the Malaysian peninsula, has 2.6 million.
   China has ties with five of the six members of ASEAN - the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a regional grouping of
non-communist countries. Brunei does not have relations with China.
   ``This will produce very positive influence on resolving
regional conflicts and maintaining peace and stability in the
region, particularly on the settlement of the Cambodian problem,''
Qian said at the signing ceremony.
   ASEAN has involved itself in trying to help resolve the
Cambodian conflict. China is the chief ally and weapons supplier
for the Khmer Rouge, the strongest guerrilla army fighting the
Vietnam-installed government in Cambodia.
   China has cooperated with the four other permanent members of
the Security Council - the Unied States, Soviet Union, Britain and
France - in drafting a peace plan for Cambodia.
   Under the plan, the Cambodian government and three guerrilla
factions would form a transitional government until the United
Nations organized new elections.
   U.N. officials and peacekeepers would supervise or run the key
government ministries in the interim, to allay fears that one party
would gain the upper hand.
   A spokesman for Singapore's U.N. Mission said, ``We have always
said that we would establish diplomatic relations after Indonesia
has done so; Indonesia did so a few months ago.'' Indonesia had
blamed China for a takeover attempt by Communists that was crushed
in 1966. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Controversial Alabama Doctor H. Ray Evers Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANDALUSIA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   H. Ray Evers, a doctor whose
unconventional treatments kept him at odds with the medical
establishment as he moved from town to town, has died of
respiratory complications at age 77.
   Evers died Tuesday in El Paso, Texas, where he moved when
Alabama medical officials barred him from practicing medicine and
ordered his clinic in Cottonwood closed in June 1989, his son,
Michael, said Wednesday.
   Evers operated a medical facility in Juarez, Mexico, just across
the border from El Paso, the son said.
   A native of Repton, Evers graduated from Vanderbilt University
Medical School in 1938 and, after serving a residency in New
Orleans, he opened a medical practice in Andalusia in 1940. He
founded Andalusia's Columbia General Hospital in 1952.
   In 1964, Evers claimed credit for developing holistic health
care, in which a patient is treated physically, mentally and
spiritually. He also was a proponent of chelation therapy, which
attemps to cleanse the circulatory system by removing arterial
plaque through the kidneys.
   His unorthodox treatments created controversy with the medical
establishment and he moved his operation every few years, going
from Andalusia to Atlanta to Belle Chase, La., Montgomery, the
Bahamas, Cottonwood and finally Mexico.
   In 1986, the Alabama Medical Licensure Commission revoked his
medical license when a cancer patient at his Cottonwood clinic died
after being treated with a salve.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge said Wednesday a
fifth-grade teacher's daily Bible readings to her class violate the
Constitution and must be stopped.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II granted a preliminary
injunction sought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf
of the parents of a 9-year-old at Emma Love Elementary School in
nearby Nassau County.
   They complained that teacher Martha Mitchell started each school
day with a Bible story and said prayers daily before lunch.
   Moore said he would set a hearing soon on a final injunction.
   ``Albeit that the defendants may have good motives ... the
practices violate the Constitution of the United States as
interpreted by the Supreme Court,'' the judge said.
   The Nassau County School Board,bolstered by strong community
support, voted 5-0 on Sept. 27 to let Mrs. Mitchell continue her
Bible-story readings, which she said she used to settle down her
class at the start of each day.
   The parents, Donald and Louise Hatch, said they have no personal
objections to Mrs. Mitchell or her teaching methods. However, they
said, their daughter should not be read Bible stories in school.
   ``We have been confident from the very beginning what the
decision would be,'' Hatch said following the 30-minute hearing
Wednesday. ``What the Nassau County School Board has been doing
clearly violates the freedom of religion.''
   Attorney Bill Sheppard, representing the Hatches on behalf of
the ACLU, said after the hearing, ``Everyone must obey the laws of
the United States of America or we'll be a country without laws.
   ``Official lawlessness is the most repugnant.''
   School board attorney Marshall Wood, who had the task of
defending the board even after informing its members that their
decision was a violation of the Constitution, told Moore that the
daily Bible reading was not meant as religious instruction but as a
means of calming the students.
   ``Mrs. Mitchell contends this (the Bible) is a piece of
literature,'' Wood said.
   Mrs. Mitchell, 51, of Fernandina Beach, did not attend the
hearing. She said earlier that she was overwhelmed by the issue.
   ``I feel very humbled by the support I have received, by the
Christian people who have come out and are willing to voice their
feelings,'' she said. ``I never imagined this.''
   Mrs. Mitchell, a Methodist, said she has read Bible stories to
her schoolchildren throughout her 30-year career.
   Superintendent Craig Marsh said the schools will abide by the
judge's ruling and will order all prayer and Bible reading stopped.
   ``I did not know it was going on until the Hatches brought it
up,'' he said Wednesday.

   Polish film director Andrzej Wajda
became ill Wednesday on a visit to Prague and was admitted to the
intensive care unit of a hospital, a doctor said.
   The doctor, who spoke on condition he not be identified, ruled
out coronary disease but declined to reveal the nature of the

   Doctors reportedly expected to release Wajda from intensive care

   Wajda, in Prague at the invitation of the Polish Cultural

with Communist authorities and dies in the 1970 Gdansk shipyard

<HEAD>Man's Life Support Removed After Judge's Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family of an 82-year-old man who has been in
a coma for six years removed his feeding tube Wednesday after
convincing a judge that he would not want to be kept alive by
artificial means.
   Sidney Greenspan has been comatose since suffering a stroke in
1984 while stricken with Alzheimer's disease, an progressive and
irreversible neurological disorder.
   His wife Bella, son Howard, and daughter Marla turned to the
legal system in 1988 to have his intravenous feeding tubes removed.
Relatives said Greenspan had expressed a desire to die if he ever
lapsed into a vegetative state.
   Cook County Circuit Court Judge Richard Dowdle consented in a
ruling Wednesday, saying the evidence presented to him was ``clear
and convincing that the ward, if mentally able, would refuse to
continue the treatment.''
   In July, the Illinois Supreme Court had ordered Dowdle to
reconsider his 1988 refusal to allow the feeding tube removal.
   The language of Dowdle's decision Wednesday echoed a June ruling
by the U.S. Supreme Court upholding Missouri guidelines that kept
the parents of car accident victim Nancy Cruzan from having her
tube feeding stopped. The parents believed Cruzan would not want to
be kept alive, but she did not leave a ``living will'' or other
such evidence.
   A neurologist, Dr. Allan Burke, testified last week that
Greenspan was in vegetative state and was getting worse.
   Burke said Greenspan could not swallow or communicate with
others, exhibited only ``primitive responses'' to stimuli, and
would die in less than a week if intravenous feeding were cut off.
   The feeding tube was removed by the family on Wednesday
afternoon at a North Side nursing home where he is cared for, said
Judy Lewis, the nursing home's director of admissions.
   ``The family members - his wife, son and daughter - were all in
the room when the tubes were removed,'' she said.
   Lewis said nursing home officials were not involved. She did not
know which family member removed the tube.
   The judge also ordered that guardians try to feed Greenspan
orally after tubes are removed.
   He refused to grant a stay requested by Americans United For
Life, a group opposing the removal of Greenspan's life support. The
group sought the stay to appeal the judge's decision.
   ``We reluctantly have decided not to appeal Judge Dowdle's
decision,'' said spokesman Paul Linton. ``Although we strongly
disagree with this finding, we also recognize that such findings
are seldom reversed on appeal.''
   Doctors have testified that Greenspan, former owner of a Chicago
plumbing supply business, lost his ability to swallow in 1985
because of Alzheimer's disease and has been tube-fed since then.

   The hijacker who seized a Boeing 737 that
plowed into two parked jets at Canton airport was identified by
Chinese authorities Wednesday as a common criminal. He was among
the 127 people killed in the fiery crash.
   Forty-six people were injured, many seriously, in the crash
early Tuesday.
   The official Xinhua News agency said those killed included 90
Chinese, 30 Taiwanese, four people from Hong Kong, two from Macao
and one American.
   Chen Kaizhi, deputy party secretary of Guangdong province,
identified the 27-year-old hijacker only as Xiaofeng of Hunan
province, and called him ``an active criminal'' who engaged in
corruption in Guangdong, Hunan and Fujian provinces. Chen said he
would provide details later.
   Chen said the hijacker was identified from his remains.
   Officials have said nothing about the cause of the crash or what
happened during the hijacking of Flight 8305 of the state-owned
Civil Aviation Administration airline. They said the pilot was
allowed to handle the situation ``as he saw fit.''
   Relatives of victims and foreign diplomats voiced anger and
frustration that China was issuing a minimum of information on the
worst reported air disaster in its history.
   ``We've been moving around like a headless chicken. Nobody has
told us where our relatives are,'' a middle-aged Chinese man said
early Wednesday, trying to get information from officials in
Canton. ``We don't know whether they are alive or dead.''
   A woman seeking news of relatives said, ``We don't think the
government officials understand how we feel.''
   They spoke on the condition of not being identified.
   The disaster comes as China is acting as host at its first major
international sporting event, the Asian Games. Security forces
nationwide had been on alert to prevent incidents that might
embarrass the government.
   In Beijing, State Council spokesman Yuan Mu called the hijacking
a tragedy but said ``it won't have an adverse effect on the
games.''
   An airport official quoted air traffic controllers as saying the
pirate appeared confused about where he wanted to go, first saying
Hong Kong, then Taiwan.
   The Boeing 737 slammed into two jets and exploded in a ball of
flames. One jet was empty. The other, a Boeing 757, was packed with
passengers bound for Shanghai.
   The airport official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
80 of the 103 people on the hijacked plane died, and 47 of the 124
people on the Boeing 757.
   Reports reaching Hong Kong said the hijacker sneaked into the
cockpit by offering the cabin crew flowers after the plane left
Xiamen, south China.
   The plane flew to Canton, where it circled the airport for about
40 minutes before crashing.
   One Western survivor reported a cockpit struggle as the plane
landed, causing it to careen into the other jets. Other reports
said the hijacker set off a bomb.
   Survivors' accounts indicated the crash was caused by the
hijacker's panic when he saw he was in Canton, raising the question
of whether the carnage could have been avoided if the jet had been
allowed to go to Hong Kong or Taiwan.
   Some travelers passing through the airport after the crash were
athletes and spectators on their way from the games in Beijing. A
Filipino spectator, Helen Chua, said after arriving in Manila that
airport officials would speak about the crash.
   National TV news Wednesday night showed a burning plane snapped
in half, with passengers covered with fire-fighting foam inching
their way down a wing to ladders. The charred, hijacked jetliner
lay flipped on its back.
   A fatality list released more than 30 hours after the disaster
at Canton's Baiyun International Airport gave the American victim's
name as Mary Anna Gerk, but her parents in the United States
identified her as Mary Anna Gilbert, 23, an English teacher from
Alexander City, Ala.
   Officials said Erin Lynne Thomas of Oklahoma City was sitting
next to Ms. Gilbert and survived, suffering a broken shoulder, head
injuries and burns.

<HEAD>Hawaii Limits on Late Filing of Income Statements Ruled Invalid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hawaii's narrow limits on the filing of
late income statements by low-income workers on welfare were
declared invalid Wednesday by a federal appeals court.
   Hawaii cancels a month's welfare benefits if a statement proving
eligibility is filed late, unless the applicant was ill or had
trouble with the mails. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
exceptions had to be broader under a federal law waiving the
deadline for ``good cause.''
   The ruling allows a woman from Waianae in Oahu to keep $198 that
the state sought to withhold in 1987 because she was a day late in
filing her statement of earned income, after her employer had
refused to provide pay stubs. Hawaii's lawyer in the case said the
decision had ``nationwide implications.''
   ``States that have restrictive definitions of good cause are on
shaky grounds'' if the ruling stands, said Deputy Attorney General
Thomas Farrell.
   Farrell said no decision has been made on an appeal.
   In the 2-1 ruling, the court said Congress intended the federal
government to define ``good cause'' instead of leaving it to the
states. The court did not provide its own definition, saying only
that Hawaii's was too narrow.
   ``We felt under any definition of good cause, it should
encompass employers' problems or any circumstances beyond (the
applicant's) control,'' said John Ishahara, a lawyer for the Legal
Aid Society of Hawaii.
   The case involves federal laws encouraging welfare recipients to
work by exempting a portion of their first four months' wages, and
a monthly amount of work expenses, from their income eligibility
limits. Recipients must file forms with the welfare department by
the sixth day of each month stating their job income.
   Regina Vierra, who has a child, got her first month's pay from a
part-time job in October 1987 and was supposed to attach her pay
verification to her November welfare eligibility form.
   But the court said her employer turned down eight requests to
provide pay stubs, and Vierra, who could not read well, was not
told by her caseworker that she could verify her income without the
stubs.
   After her employer finally provided the stubs, she filed the
form one business day late. Under Hawaii's definition of ``good
cause'' for lateness, adopted in 1984, the state refused to deduct
a portion of her earnings from her income and denied her $198 check
for a month because she did not fit the exceptions of illness or
mail troubles. She was paid the benefits conditionally, however,
while she appealed the decision.
   Reversing a ruling by U.S. District Judge Harold Fong, the
appeals court said Hawaii's restrictive definition of ``good
cause'' conflicted with the federal welfare law's goal of
``fostering self-sufficiency and personal independence.''
   ``Congress expressly included the `good cause' exemption to
provide a shield for innocent late filers,'' said the opinion by
Judge Harry Pregerson.

<TEXT>
   The first of this season's ``Live from Lincoln
Center'' telecasts was performed Wednesday night by the New York
Philharmonic, conducted by Zubin Mehta, with guest pianist Daniel
Barenboim.
   Some classical soloists who have taken up conducting as a
serious parallel career find they're better performers when they
return to their musical instruments. Barenboim seems to be one of
those, playing with more conviction about the music than we
remembered from some years ago.
   Barenboim, who played two concerti, was music director of the
Orchestre de Paris from 1975 to 1989 and has been named music
director of the Chicago Symphony, beginning next season.
   He hadn't played piano with the New York Philharmonic since
1984.
   In his first piece, Beethoven's ``Concerto No. 3 for Piano and
Orchestra,'' Barenboim's sound was that of a pianist who cares
about the music. He plays with clarity. And he played on the same
wave length as the orchestra, merging the piano sound with the
orchestra's sound.
   Soft parts were very beautiful. Some of them were introspective,
some bittersweet, some deeply sad but serene not anguished,
dignified not maudlin.
   The concerto was played for its music, not used as a showcase.
   Tchaikovsky's ``Concerto No. 1 for Piano and Orchestra,'' played
after intermission, was more of a showcase for speed and
virtuosity. When it began, Barenboim was more subtle and varied in
dynamics than some recordings. But Mehta raised the volume and
Barenboim began to attack more aggressively.
   This concerto is written to be a dazzler that the audience can
flow along with, one reason it's so popular. But it's even more
impressive when some of it softens more than was done Wednesday
night.
   Barenboim had the strength and passion for the furiously fast
parts but his playing there seemed to flow less naturally than it
had in the quieter parts of the Beethoven.
   The concert, a pension fund benefit, held in Avery Fisher Hall,
began with Weber's ``Oberon Overture.'' This is very sweet at the
start and rises to some excitement. Through both moods, the New
York Philharmonic's playing was smooth as silk.

<HEAD>New Cancer Test Needs More Study, But Could Bring Low-Cost Early
Detection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDY SHORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A researcher says he's developed a simple test
that could cost as little as $25 and provide early detection of
many cancers, but an American Cancer Society official said
Wednesday it may not be specific enough.
   Stuart Gordon of the University of Colorado Health Sciences
Center admits more research is needed, but said results of early
experiments, published Monday in the medical journal Cancer
Research, are promising.
   ``This is too small a study to make any absolute statement, but
it's enough to make us proceed'' with full-fledged clinical trials,
Gordon said.
   The test, which uses just a few drops of blood, detects a
protein that appears to be present at high levels only when normal
cells are becoming malignant, he said.
   The test was 100 percent effective in identifying the protein in
the early stages of cancer growth, and was 76 percent effective in
identifying late-stage cancers.
   Dr. John Laszlo, a senior vice president for research at the
Atlanta-based American Cancer Society, said the test could be less
useful than Gordon thinks, adding it was too early to tell.
   ``It's like taking your temperature. You don't know from the
reading whether you have tuberculosis or you have the flu,'' he
said.
   The test is the result of research Gordon began in 1972, when he
set out to find out why cancer patients often have problems with
blood clotting.
   ``It struck me that this meant there was something coming from
the cancer cells that activated this clotting,'' he said.
   Gordon found a protein in the blood of most cancer patients,
particularly those in the early stages of their disease. Cancer
cells apparently need the protein to reproduce, but its purpose and
origins have not been established.
   ``I think they've made a finding that this particular blood
coagulant is abnormal and now we need to know how specific it is
and how often people that don't have cancer do have this kind of
abnormality,'' Laszlo said. ``You might expect patients with other
kinds of diseases to have this kind of protein in their blood.''
   Gordon's study involved 128 blood samples, 54 from people with
various types of cancers, 20 from patients with benign growths and
54 healthy subjects.
   Current tests are aimed at specific cancers, but Gordon said his
test would detect any type of cancer. Gordon hopes expanded
clinical trials will test at least 1,000 people over a two year
period.
   Gordon, a biochemist and associate professor at the University
of Colorado School of Medicine, holds a patent on the blood test
and is negotiating with several pharmaceutical companies to pay for
the massive trials.
   About 1.5 million Americans are expected to be diagnosed with
cancer this year, with more than 500,000 deaths projected, figures
show.
   Gordon said the test, administered in a doctor's office and
costing $25 to $40, may be just four years away.
   ``Today, we are able to do a better job of treating early-stage
cancers,'' with early detection significantly improving cancer
survival tests, he said.

<HEAD>Metal Chips in Reporter's Body From Old Wound, New Autopsy Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new autopsy on the body of a
reporter who died in a car crash last week cast doubt on reports
that he and another journalist had been the victims of foul play.
   Pedro Martinez Guzman, 28, and Jorge Euceda, 38, were found dead
near their wrecked car 27 miles east of the capital Friday.
   Colleagues and relatives asked a human rights group to authorize
an autopsy, which revealed the presence of metal fragments in the
Martinez Guzman's body.
   The Roman Catholic Church's legal aid office said bullet
fragments lodged in Martinez Guzman's face, causing him to crash
the car he was driving.
   But a second autopsy, ordered by Transit Judge Vicente Serrano,
showed the fragments were from an earlier injury, said Coroner
Denis Castro Bobadilla.
   Martinez Guzman was editor of the Salvadoran magazine Semana and
correspondent for the respected Mexican magazine Proceso. Euceda
was a journalism professor at a local university and a contributor
to the newspaper Diario Latino.
   Serrano said the investigation was continuing.
   The armed forces press office said Tuesday that four witnesses
had reported seeing the reporters' car had being struck by a truck.
The reporters were thrown from the vehicle after it overturned, the
press office said.
   The journalists were returning from a reporting trip to eastern
El Salvador.
   In Mexico City, the Association of Foreign Correspondents in
Mexico sent a letter to Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani
expressing ``profound consternation'' at the deaths.
   It urged the government to ``do all possible to clarify the
circumstances of death and to bring to justice those ultimately
responsible.''
   At least 40 reporters have died in political violence covering
El Salvador's 10-year-old civil war.

   Soldiers seized control of an army
base on the southern island of Mindanao on Thursday. Here is a
summary of previous coup attempts since President Corazon Aquino
took office in Feburary 1986:
   
   Manila Hotel Coup Attempt
   July 6, 1986
   About 100 rebel soldiers led by three generals and hundreds of
followers of the late President Ferdinand Marcos occupied the
luxury Manila Hotel where they proclaimed Arturo Tolentino, Marcos'
running mate in the Feb. 7 snap presidential elections, as
president. The rebels surrendered peacefully after occupying the
hotel for nearly 40 hours. The government dropped rebellion charges
against Tolentino and the rebels after they pledged loyalty to the
constitution.
   
   Enrile Attempt
   Nov. 22 1986
   The military under then Chief of Staff Gen. Fidel Ramos aborted
a coup attempt dubbed ``God Save the Queen.'' Ramos two weeks
earlier ordered all commanders to neutralize a plot by ``military
adventurists'' to eliminate leftists in the Aquino government,
confirming a newspaper report of a coup plot by disenchanted
officers close to Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile. The plot
involved removing ``inept and left-leaning'' Cabinet and other
government officials and reducing Mrs. Aquino, ``the queen,'' to a
figurehead role in government where Enrile would emerge as the real
power broker. No arrests were made, but Enrile was removed in a
Cabinet shakeup on Nov. 23.
   
   GMA Takeover
   Jan. 27, 1987
   Troops loyal to Marcos seized a television station and raided at
least two suburban military bases. One mutineer was killed, and 16
others were wounded in a pre-dawn firefight at the Villamor air
base next to the Manila international airport. Rebels also raided
the armory of the Philippine navy at Sangley point in Cavite City,
10 miles south of Manila, and took two officers hostage. Rebels at
Sangley and Villamor later surrendered. Air Force Col. Oscar
Canlas, who led the takeover of GMA 7 station, surrendered after
holding out for 61 hours. He was tried by a military tribunal and
sentenced to 12 years at hard labor for rebellion.
   
   Black Saturday
   April 18, 1987
   Mutineers led by a pro-Marcos officer stormed the army
headquarters at Fort Bonifacio and seized some 50 hostages in a bid
to free comrades jailed after the failed January coup attempt. The
rebels aired demands for a military takeover of the government,
which they claimed was infiltrated by communists. One mutineer was
killed and two hostages were injured in a brief firefight. The
mutineers surrendered eight hours after their pre-dawn attack.
   
   Honasan Coup Attempt
   Aug. 28, 1987
   Soldiers led by renegade Army Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''
Honasan attacked the Malacanang presidential palace before dawn but
were repulsed by Mrs. Aquino's personal security group. The rebels
also tried to seize the armed forces general headquarters in Camp
Aguinaldo and seized the government television station and a hotel
nearby. The rebellion was crushed less than 24 hours after it was
launched. Honasan, a former Enrile aide, escaped, leaving at least
53 dead and more than 300 injured, including Mrs. Aquino's only
son.
   
   December Coup Attempt
   Dec. 1-9, 1989
   About 3,000 rebel soldiers launched this coup attempt. Rebel
aircraft bombed the Malacanang presidential palace and the armed
forces headquarters. Mutineers seized the Villamor air base and the
Sangley naval armory. On the first day of the mutiny, U.S. jets
provided air cover for loyal troops and turned the tide in favor of
the government. Rebel soldiers briefly occupied the government
television station but failed to air propaganda. They also seized
the Mactan air base in Cebu in the central Philippines. Rebel
soldiers, driven out of Fort Bonifacio army headquarters, seized
several high-rise apartments and hotels in the nearby financial
district of Makati, holding out for five days before they
surrendered. The rebellion ended Dec. 9 when the Mactan rebels led
by air force Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador surrendered. The fighting
killed at least 113 people and wounded more than 600. At least
1,099 soldiers, including 159 officers, have surrendered or been
arrested.

   Forty-five years after its defeat and dissection,
Germany is again one nation, its leaders facing the formidable task
of merging two alien systems and promising that this new power
dominating Europe will serve peace.
   Massed before the battle-scarred Reichstag building and awash in
floodlights, an estimated 1 million Germans from all walks of life
joined at midnight in an emotion-laden chorus of the national
anthem.
   Fireworks lighted up the sky and bells - one of them pealed near
the ruins of Hitler's citadel. Schoolchildren hoisted a huge German
flag.
   Eleven months after the Berlin Wall fell in a peaceful revolt
that cast aside Communist overlords, the city that symbolized the
Cold War division of Europe rejoiced. It is again the capital of a
united Germany.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Secretary of State James A. Baker III says there
is growing sentiment among nations to force Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait and the Bush administration is weighing such a military move
through the United Nations.
   After a week of talking to other world leaders at the United
Nations, Baker said Tuesday night: ``There is more of a willingness
to consider some sort of an approach like that, if it became
necessary at an appropriate time, than we had anticipated there
might be at this stage of the conflict.''
   But he stressed that sentiments could change quickly, even in
one day. And he emphasized the administration prefers a diplomatic
and political solution to Iraq's annexation of Kuwait and seizure
of the Persian Gulf emirate's oil fields.
   Baker spoke at the conclusion of a two-day meeting of 35 foreign
ministers to prepare for a European Security Conference summit in
Paris on Nov. 19-21.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush wants Americans to convince
skittish lawmakers that backing a $500 billion budget package won't
cost them re-election, even though it requires taxpayers to
shoulder ``a small burden.''
   ``I'm not, and I know you're not, a fan of tax increases,'' Bush
said in a nationally televised address Tuesday night.
   ``But if there have to be tax measures, they should allow the
economy to grow. They should not turn us back to higher income tax
rates, and they should be fair,'' he added, referring to the
proposed tax increases on gasoline, cigarettes, boats, liquor and
furs.
   In a third straight day of public and private lobbying for the
agreement worked out by his aides and congressional leaders, the
president was meeting today with journalists from around the
country.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Some Americans may have to choose between
heating their homes and buying food this winter as they face
soaring fuel costs, a proposed new energy tax and scarce government
aid, advocacy groups say.
   ``We're going back into the `food or fuel' problem of the early
'70s for low-income and senior citizens,'' says Edwin Rothschild,
an energy specialist at Citizen Action, a consumer and
environmental group.
   The average heating bill of $800 - common in much of the
ortheast - will be closer to $1,200 this winter, he predicted.
   Federal officials said Tuesday that barring a further flareup in
the Persian Gulf, there will be more than enough heating oil and
natural gas to meet demand this winter.

   KINGSTON, Mass. (AP) - The search for 13-year-old Melissa Benoit
ended in a way that has traumatized this picture-book community:
The girl's body was found in the basement of her neighbor, a father
of two who had helped look for her.
   ``I'd rather know that it was just some sicko that grabbed her
off the street than someone she trusted,'' said Michelle Ponte, who
lives in nearby Plymouth. ``I have a 10-year-old daughter who
absolutely freaked out when she heard this.''
   The slaying on Main Street hit just about everyone in this town
of 8,500, where trees are hung with pink ribbons in Melissa's honor
and dozens of people - including the alleged killer - joined the
search after she disappeared Sept. 15.
   Melissa's partially clad body was found last week buried in the
basement of Henry Meinholz Jr. He has pleaded innocent to murder.
The cause of death has not been determined.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Four people who say a snooty bouncer at a
chic nightclub denied them entry and made them feel ``like scum''
because of their unhip clothing are asking a judge to decide
whether that's cool under the law.
   The four argued Tuesday in small claims court that their civil
rights were violated. They want damages of $250 apiece.
   The four - a lawyer, a termite company operator, an accountant
and an accounting manager from the San Fernando Valley - said they
were rejected by a doorman at the Mayan, a trendy downtown club
that used to be a porno theater.
   Municipal Court Commissioner Diana Wheatley said she would issue
a ruling later.

<HEAD>New Fox Series Says Values Distorted in Beverly Hills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In tonight's new Fox show, Brenda, a pretty
16-year-old whose family just moved from Minneapolis to the
glittering hamlet of Beverly Hills, is puzzled by what she's seen
so far.
   ``Brandon,'' she asks her twin brother, ``are we going to make
it here?''
   Brandon has much wisdom. ``The houses are bigger, the weather's
warmer, but - doesn't mean they've cracked the meaning of life,
y'know what I mean?''
   This pretty well sums up the plot of ``Beverly Hills, 90210.''
   A new one-hour Thursday series, it originally was called ``Class
of Beverly Hills.'' But Fox either realized that today's Beverly
Hills has no class or there are too many Southern California high
school series on TV.
   With its decent, wholesome twins played by Jason Priestly and
Shannen Doherty, the series concerns the assimilation of a decent,
wholesome Midwest family into new and, gosh, almost unreal
surroundings.
   The two co-stars are pretty good actors. But they deserve a
medal or something, because the premiere - written by Darren Star,
yes, Darren Star - is so stultifying it would get an F even in film
school.
   And it runs 90 minutes.
   You don't need that much time to prove that shows about vast
wealth, shallow people, expensive cars, monstrous mansions,
bubbling Jacuzzis and even distorted values mean nothing without
Really Bad Dialogue.
   There is almost no RBD, as we call it in the trade, to goof on
here. There only is stilted teen chat and stock teen-age
characters, albeit the wealthy kind.
   Tonight's show concerns doings in the make-believe West Beverly
Hills High School, where the new kids in town first meet the
pampered offspring of movie and TV stars, tycoons and maybe network
presidents.
   The twins drive an old Chevy compact. Not so their new peers.
They drive BMWs, Mercedes and Porsches, and think nothing of sushi
for lunch, or Friday night pool parties with rock bands, with the
whole school invited.
   This display of the quiet good taste that is the hallmark of
Beverly Hills causes a certain amount of teen-age snobbery and
insecurity, of course.
   But is it all that different from the Midwestern kind? Maybe.
Consider Brandon's new girlfriend, a poor little rich kid. The
daughter of a rock band manager, she casually says her mother once
was a ``major groupie.''
   There is some excitement, however, in this clash of Midwestern
and Movietown cultures.
   For example, Brandon declines to make love to his new sweetie as
they sit bubbling in her Jacuzzi, even though she enthusiastically
suggests it.
   He contends they haven't known each other long enough: ``I mean,
aren't you supposed to hold out on me for a little bit?''
   This is soooo intense that she has a florist bring him roses a
day later. Right there in Spanish class.
   Alas, the whole school gets the wrong idea about what's going
on, pattly because he doesn't deny anything, not even when a
classmate says, ``You must be awesome, dude.'' Brandon now faces a
crisis.
   But sister Brenda isn't doing so well, either. She doctors the
birthdate on her driver's license, goes to a night club with new
friends, and meets a suave, blonde, 25-year-old lawyer who thinks
she is of legal age.
   He is patient, respectful and understanding when she says ``no''
on the first date. But three dates later, when he's pressing for
bedtime, she confesses her dark secret. Boy, does he get cranky.
   He carries on as if she is not . . . sincere.
   All this would seem prime fodder for a film about old-fashioned
values in Beverly Hills. You could call it ``Teenage Mutant Ninja
Conservatives.''
   But all we get here is an epic in bland, one in which the twins'
parents are only comforting ciphers and most of the wealthy
teen-agers are so tame it appears their idea of kicks is a drive-by
spending spree.
   The night's only major crisis consists of Brandon's discovery
that a bright, ambitious coed he respects secretly lives in . . .
Van Nuys.
   Wow, Valley Girl! Gnarly! Quel Drag!
   Near tears, she asks him this: ``Why should I be deprived of a
good education because I am geographically undesirable?''
   My child, thank your stars you are geographically undesirable.
If you continue at West Beverly Hills High, you will wind up going
into TV and writing a series with its own ZIP code, like ``Beverly
Hills, 90210.''

   `GRAND' MINUS TWO RETURNS: NBC's ``Grand'' sitcom begins its
second NBC season tonight, its residents recovering from an
end-of-season tornado in the tiny piano-factory hamlet of Grand.
Two characters are gone now, Wayne the cop, and Tom, the husband of
Carol Anne, daughter of the town patriarch. The series now will
emphasize Carol Anne (Bonnie Hunt) and the chain-smoking,
lower-class Janice (Pamela Reed), and a dark secret will be
revealed in coming episodes. Will viewers learn who killed Laura
Palmer? Nahhh. Besides, who cares?

<HEAD>Enrollment Triples At Tiny School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE KAFKA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MISSION RIDGE, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Enrollment tripled at the Orton
School this fall, but there is no risk of overcrowding. Three
students now share the school's single classroom.
   ``Now I have someone to play with at recess,'' said Levi Tibbs,
a fifth-grader who was the school's lone student last year.
   His playmates are sisters Emily Hansen, a second grader, and
Sheri Davis, who is in sixth grade. Their attendance at the 1918
schoolhouse has helped stave off its extinction.
   ``We considered closing it, but if we did, then we'd have to pay
to board those kids in town or we'd have to pay mileage for them to
be driven to school and home every day,'' said county school
Superintendent Jerry Kleinsasser.
   And that trip is no quick jaunt. The nearest town is Fort
Pierre, a long hour's drive down 50 miles of bumpy, winding road
that follows the rugged breaks of the Missouri River.
   Locals call the area starkly beautiful. Outsiders call it
desolate. Winters are harsh and snowy on the Dakota prairie, and
the wind almost never stills.
   ``You can hear the coyotes fighting and jabbering all night
long,'' said teacher Steve Pickner, 31, who lives with his dog in a
rent-free mobile home on the school site. His nearest neighbors are
antelope, grouse and rattlesnakes.
   Pickner is in his first year as a teacher - he graduated from
the University of South Dakota in August - and he has his qualms.
   ``I'd rather teach 50 kids in one class than three in different
grades,'' he said. ``That's 21 separate lessons I have to prepare
each night, but it does keep me busy and helps pass the time out
here.''
   It's hard to get used to the quiet after classes. ``I look
forward to Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays when the mail comes,''
Pickner said.
   Occasionally, he helps mend fences at a nearby ranch that raises
one of the nation's largest private buffalo herds.
   Elementary Principal Elsie Baye says teachers rarely stay more
than a year at Orton. ``It's isolated,'' she admits, and the free
housing is essential to lure teachers to such a rustic outpost.
   Still, she persists in putting the best face on it: ``Someone
who is an artist or wildlife photographer would just love it
there.''
   And as for the children, ``It's a great educational opportunity.
Our rural kids are usually good students. They get a lot of
one-on-one.''
   Levi Tibb's mother, Loretta, taught at the Orton School; her
husband, Wayne, and their three other children all went there.
``They were almost a year ahead of other students when they got to
ninth grade,'' she said.
   In Orton's classroom - big and bright with three desks in the
middle - two students sit together while Pickner tutors the third
across the room.
   An outdated computer sits in one corner; a television set that
gets only one channel sits in another. The other classroom fixtures
include an aging piano, an ant farm, a water fountain and a
microwave oven where the kids and teacher heat their lunches.
   Once a month, a janitor shows up to shine the linoleum floor.
Three times a day, the huge bell atop the freshly painted white
building tolls.
   The bell did not toll this year for the Orton School, but its
future is not assured. Stanley County rural schools once were full,
but fewer ranch families live in the area, Mrs. Tibbs said.
   ``They couldn't all make a living here anymore because milking
cows and a few acres of land just didn't cut it. People sold out to
others, and the remaining ranches got bigger. That cut down on
families and kids in the area,'' she said.
   But Orton is not alone in its tininess. Of the three other rural
schools in Stanley County, none has more than eight students.
   Almost one-fourth of the elementary schools in South Dakota
still have only one or two teachers. Legally, schools cannot be
closed unless enrollment slips to fewer than five. And neither the
kids nor their parents seem inclined abandon the small schools.
   ``It's funner than a big school,'' said Sheri Davis.

<HEAD>Another Budget Crisis, Another Deadline Deal</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another budget, another crisis, another
deadline deal - complete with congressional vows that it won't
happen this way again.
   But it always does.
   That's not the way the job is supposed to be done, and there
still is no guarantee that the bargain reached at the brink of
budget disaster is going to hold.
   President Bush urged taxpayers, who soon will be voters, to back
the plan, calling it ``the best agreement that can be legislated
now'' and saying the alternative is economic chaos. With some
Republicans balky, and with public opinion surveys reporting
opposition to the tax and spending steps involved, Bush made his
appeal Tuesday night in a 10-minute, nationally televised speech.
   After four months of futility and 10 days of hard bargaining,
budget negotiators reached a compromise before the dawn of Monday's
deadline, and described the outcome as successful if politically
distasteful.
   But the deal carries its own fine-print concessions of failure.
It masks the true size of the projected federal deficit by ruling
that some major expenditures simply don't count, and erases
ceilings that can't be met.
   Nevertheless, the five-year, $500 billion plan does make a start
at pruning chronic deficits. Without it, the government would be
dispatched to chaos by automatic spending cuts under the 1983
deficit control law that was supposed to avoid all this in the
first place.
   Lobbying House Republicans to support the settlement, Bush
argued that all the alternatives are worse. He said he had to
compromise and they should too. But he doesn't have to run for
re-election until 1992, and they're facing the voters in just over
a month.
   This is the sixth time in nine years that Congress and the
administration have negotiated budget deals because they can't
handle the job the old-fashioned way, in which presidents make
proposals and the House and Senate vote on spending and taxes.
Because presidents have veto power, that process required
compromise and negotiations, but the votes came first.
   Still, Congress seldom met its own deadlines for action on
budget measures, ignoring them because there were no sanctions to
enforce them.
   ``Congress' self-imposed budget deadlines have usually been
missed, and massive continuing resolutions and reconciliation bills
have been the rule rather than the exception,'' President Reagan
said in his final budget message.
   He said those ``large, cumbersome bills provide cozy hiding
places'' for special-interest spending by lumping all the
government's money decisions into one giant measure. Reagan had
said he wouldn't sign any more of them.
   Bush had said he wouldn't do business that way, either.
``Government by continuing resolution - or government by crisis -
will not do,'' Bush said in his first presidential address to
Congress in 1989.
   The tax and spending provisions that make up the budget
compromise of 1990 will go into giant reconciliation bill to be
passed before Oct. 20 or else. Without it, the automatic spending
cuts will hit.
   But first, to buy time for that effort, Congress has to pass a
budget resolution by midnight tomorrow, the deadline on a five-day
extension approved on Sunday. The government also must have an
increase in the debt ceiling, which was extended through Friday.
   Without deadlines, nothing tends to happen.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., likened it to the college student who
never studied until the night before finals, then crammed all
night. ``He flunked,'' Helms said, ``and the result will be the
same. Congress will flunk.''
   It has so far. In every previous budget pact, projected deficits
have been far lower than the real ones turned out to be. ``They
have never once been met,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y. ``They are wildly below reality.''
   The budget pact Bush and Congress negotiated last year forecast
a deficit of $99.4 billion, just under the legal limit. The
administration now forecasts a deficit of at least $218.5 billion
for the budget year that ended Sunday.
   The deficit ceiling was supposed to be $64 billion this year,
but that fiction is gone. Under the new budget agreement, the
projected deficit won't be that low until 1995. The target for this
budget year has been more than tripled, to a $205 billion deficit.
And getting there took a numbers game.
   Even so, if the deal and the estimates hold, the deficits would
start to decline. ``This is real,'' Bush said, as he lobbied fellow
Republicans to make it happen.

<HEAD>Ralph Nader Tackles Insurance Industry in New Book</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's a jungle out there for insurance buyers,
and unwary consumers sometimes spend too much for too little
coverage because they don't know the right questions to ask.
   Consumer activist Ralph Nader believes the insurance industry
would like to keep it that way.
   ``There is a deliberate gobbledygook that occurs in order to
reduce your common-sense defenses,'' he said in a recent interview.
   Nader also believes a consumer backlash over high rates and
confusing policies is erupting nationwide, most notably in
California, where voters approved a proposition last year that
mandates sharp cuts in auto insurance rates.
   He says his latest book, ``Winning the Insurance Game,'' should
help dispel some of the confusion and better arm those shopping for
insurance.
   The book takes an encyclopedic approach to all the forms of
insurance a typical American might encounter, including government
programs such as Social Security and Medicare. It explains in plain
English the various types of insurance policies, their benefits and
their bad points.
   Nader said he wrote the book along with writer and former
attorney Wesley Smith because he believes most consumers are
ill-prepared in the insurance marketplace.
   ``Where would they learn? They don't learn in school about how
to buy and what not to buy in the insurance market. Are there
consumer training clinics, adult education? No. So they sort of
pick up what they pick up through the school of hard knocks, and
that's not enough.''
   Nader described a number of common mistakes of insurance buyers.
Chief among them is not knowing about discounts that are available
for the asking.
   Another mistake is assuming that all insurance companies and
insurance agents charge about the same.
   Smith, who also participated in the interview, told of his own
experience in buying auto insurance that shows the value of
shopping around.
   Smith said he went to a number of companies that were the least
expensive by reputation. The best rate he found was about $2,900 a
year for two cars.
   ``So I went to another agent who sold from the same carrier who
had been in business longer. I said, `Look, I've been offered this
insurance but I know this price isn't right because I know based on
the reputation of the company that you can do better. He looked at
me and he said, `Let me ask you, do you own your own home?' I said,
`Yes, I do. Why?' `Because that puts you in a preferred rate.' That
saved me 900 bucks a year.''
   Nader said other discounts consumers need to ask about include
those for airbag-equipped cars and multiple policies in the same
family. In addition, he said, many people buy too much auto
liability coverage based on the level of their assets that they
need to protect.
   Another problem for many drivers, he said, is ``they don't know
to put their best foot forward and get a reduction in price by
showing they've got a great driving record.''
   With life insurance, a common error is being talked into an
investment vehicle attached to the policy that really isn't needed
but jacks up the rate, Nader said.
   Nader and Smith said health insurance may be the most
problematic for consumers.
   ``They tend to buy too many micro policies that should be
instead handled by an umbrella policy,'' Nader said. ``Why should
you buy a cancer policy? Why should you buy any one of the micro
policies that usually are overpriced?''
   Another mistake, he said, involves so-called medigap insurance,
which supplements Medicare.
   ``Some elderly people have been known to have five or 10 medigap
policies. They keep responding to that celebrity on TV who you saw
in a movie 25 years ago.''
   Among other mistakes with health insurance is ignorance of what
policies exclude, such as eyeglasses, pre-existing conditions and
normal pregnancies, Smith and Nader said.
   But perhaps the biggest problem with individual health insurance
is its cost, the two said.
   ``Individual policies are basically out of the price range of
most Americans,'' Smith said. ``So that leaves them with group
policies through work. And a lot of people will stay in jobs they
loath rather than lose that potential benefit.''
   Smith and Nader argue that the only solution to the health
insurance problem is a national health insurance plan.

<HEAD>Criticism of the Budget Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The budget agreement reached by negotiators and
endorsed by President Bush would depress the economy, seriously
slow job growth and in some ways be self-defeating, according to
one study making the rounds.
   Former U.S. Treasury economists who conducted the study said the
$500 billion estimate of deficit reduction is badly overstated
because negotiators chose to ignore the negative, even recessionary
economic impact of higher taxes.
   The study, for the National Center for Policy Analysis and the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, concludes that in some ways the agreement
would contradict its purpose, costing $1.24 in lowered output for
every revenue dollar generated.
   ``Most people are complaining about the new taxes they will have
to pay, but the greater burden is the loss of output and lower
personal income that will be caused by higher taxes,'' said Gary
Robbins, one of the authors.
   Robbins, former chief of the Treasury's econometric forecasting
staff, said the budget negotiators failed to recognize that
implementation of the budget would produce a dynamic, largely
negative effect.
   Robbins and his wife, Aldona, former senior economist in the
Treasury's office of economic policy, now operate Fiscal
Associates, a consulting firm. Their econometric model produced
these differences from projections in the budget agreement:
   - There would be 408,000 fewer jobs by 1995 and almost 520,000
fewer jobs by the year 2000.
   - Real gross national product, the total of goods and services
produced, would be $112.6 billion lower over the next five years,
and would be more than $50 billion a year lower than the
projections by the end of the decade.
   - Because tax payments would be lower in a depressed economy,
the federal government would receive only 67 cents of each dollar
of new taxes it presumes to collect over the next five years.
   - The deficit reduction would be about $44 billion less than the
five-year, $500 billion estimate.
   The study did agree with the Office of Management and Budget
projections, used by budget negotiators, that federal spending
would fall as a percentage of gross national product. But it
differed in more ways than it agreed.
   ``Government forecasters assume that the federal government can
collect new taxes without causing any economic harm,'' said Gary
Robbins. ``Our own forecast is more realistic.''
   He said the budget package would worsen an existing recession by
imposing new income, payroll and excise taxes in an effort to raise
$134 billion of revenues over the next five years.
   By his estimates, that effort would fail, with new revenues
amounting to only $90.2 billion, again because higher taxes would
depress economic activity. Over five years, he said, lost output
would equal $450 a person.
   The chamber and the center, which commissioned the study, have
been both supporters and critics of administration policies in the
past. The center describes itself as a nonpartisian, nonprofit
policy research organization.
   Earlier, analysts at the conservative Heritage Foundation, whose
ideas and policies have influenced thinking in the Reagan and Bush
administrations, called the budget agreement deplorable.
   The Heritage analysis, by Daniel Mitchell, a foundation fellow,
said the package ``combines the largest first-year tax increase in
America's history, dubious economic assumptions, phony spending
cuts and inadequate enforcement.''
   Mitchell said that at a time when annual economic growth has
slowed to a crawl, ``enacting of the agreement surely would throw
the nation into recession.''

   Teaching moral standards and religious elements of history,
generally shunned by public schools in recent decades, seems to be
making a sporadic but growing comeback.
   This is the assessment of specialists in the field who cite
accumulating evidence of the shift, which they say is urgently
needed to overcome a huge gap in educating the young.
   The situation ``has been pathetic,'' educator Charles R. Kniker
said of the failure of recent decades to teach religion's pervasive
historical and social influences.
   The omission has been documented in numerous studies of
textbooks. But the ignored influences and effects of religion
gradually and sporadically are being restored, Kniker said.
   ``It's slow going, but it's a clear phenomenon,'' he said in an
interview. ``There's a major growth of interest in academic study
about religion in the schools. It's been a wilderness, but
certainly changes are going on.''
   Kniker, professor of education at Iowa State University and
editor of the journal Religion &amp; Public Education, has made a
national survey of state policies on teaching about religion and
moral values.
   Results showed a spotty pattern, but indicated developing
concern in that field.
   Since the survey broke new ground, however, prior data was
lacking with which to compare the results.
   ``The main purpose was to get a big snapshot of where we are now
in this country,'' a ``base line study to see what is the reality''
so comparisons can be made with it in the future, he said.
   Thirteen states permit teaching about religion in social
studies, while typically prohibiting indoctrincation in a
religion's beliefs. As Alabama specifies, it allows ``religious
facts only.''
   Ten states have school policies on the Bible as literature, some
noting that the Supreme Court outlawed systematic or devotional
reading of the Bible, but approved ``objective teaching of
religion.''
   Iowa, for instance, specifies: ``Religious books such astthe
Bible, the Torah and the Koran shall not be excluded from any
public school . . . nor shall any child be required to read such
religious books contrary to the wishes of the child's parent or
guardian.''
   Twelve states set policies on religion in world history, some
calling for units about religion in such courses.
   ``California legislation requiring textbooks to have greater
acknowledgement of the role of religion in history exemplifies a
trend gaining much national attention,'' the survey report says.
   Forty-one states have laws or guidelines on citizenship or
character education, and 20 states mention moral-spiritual values.
But some indicated that teaching them was taboo, or limited to
``democratic values.''
   Kentucky leaves choice about values to school districts, while
Ohio and Wisconsin designate the values to be taught.
   Ohio lists ``compassion, courtesy, tolerance, honesty,
self-discipline, self-respect, responsibility, courage, diligence
and integrity.'' Wisconsin adds ``personal ethics'' and the ``value
of frugality.''
   Twenty states allow observance of a moment of silence, none
mentioning that the practice replaced school prayer. Recitation in
schools of the Pledge of Allegiance is required in 19 states, while
many make participation voluntary.
   Charles C. Haynes of Washington, D.C., president of the National
Council on Religion and Public Education, which publishes the
journal edited by Kniker, said:
   ``Changes are coming very rapidly, encouraging more teaching
about religion in history and teaching of values. Many districts
are adopting new policies . . . The change is quite dramatic. It's
now irreversible.''
   Haynes, author of a new book, ``Religion in American History,
What to Teach and How,'' published by the Association for
Supervision and Curriculum Development, noted recent approval by
the California State Textbook Commission of a new history textbook
published by Houghton Mifflin that covers religious dimensions of
history.
   Haynes said both educators and religious scholars are achieving
``common ground'' about the essential inclusion of teaching about
religion, noting recent guidelines about it issued by broad
religious-educational coalitions.
   The consensus ``grew out of a controversial time,'' he said. But
now it's generally recognized that teaching about religion is
``good for education, good for students, and more important, good
for religious liberty.''
   Kniker said expulsion of religious knowledge from schools
stemmed from misinterpretations of the 1962-63 Supreme Court
decisions banning sponsored prayer and Bible devotionals.
   Schools and textbook publishers purged virtually any religious
reference, fearing controversy, even though the court had said
study about religion was essential to education, he said.
   Kniker said present changes in attitudes resulted from rising
evangelical concern and from many studies showing the stark absence
of religious facts from classroom versions of history and society.
   School board and teacher requests for guidance materials have
soared, prompting the National Council on Religion and Public
Education's distribution center at Iowa State University in Ames to
open a telephone service, Kniker said.
   More than 500,000 copies of the pamphlet ``Religion in the
Public School Curriculum, Questions and Answers,'' which was put
together by a wide array of educational and religious
organizations, have gone to school officials and others.

   Dan Martin, who was fired as managing
editor of Baptist Press by the fundamentalist-dominated Southern
Baptist executive committee, has been named to head a rival news
service.
   He was named interim news director of Associated Baptist Press,
which was set up after the June firing of Martin and Baptist Press
director Al Shackleford raised questions about continued
reliability of the denomination's agency.
   Editors of state Baptist newspapers and Shackleford are on the
board of directors of the alternative news service.
   Martin, 51, pledged to cater to no political agenda - moderate
or fundamentalist - in overseeing the new service.

<HEAD>Toyota Land Cruiser: Redesign Smooths Ride, Profile</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota has taken the edge off its Land Cruiser for 1991, both
inside and out. The company's most expensive four-wheel-drive
vehicle retains the wide, brutish look of an off-road cruiser,
though design changes have softened its profile and smoothed its
ride.
   The squarish front hood is rounded and more aerodynamic. There's
full-time four-wheel-drive to reduce vibration and tire wear and
help with low-speed steering. For even more traction the center
differential can be locked via a dashboard button and the vehicle
shifted into low range.
   Coil springs at all four wheels give a smoother, more car-like
ride. And the redesign includes 5 inches added to the wheelbase and
2 to the track, giving the Land Cruiser a longer wheelbase and
wider track than either the Range Rover or Jeep's Grand Wagoneer.
   Toyota kept the 4-liter, six-cylinder powerplant from last year.
The fuel-injected engine is rated at 155 horsepower and was paired
with the standard four-speed automatic overdrive transmission in
the vehicle offered for testing.
   The package offers enough power for lumbering over ditches and
other rough terrain at low speeds, but slow acceleration made it
less satisfactory in highway passing. Toyota has not joined Range
Rover and Grand Wagoneer in offering an eight-cylinder engine.
   As with most of the vehicles in this class fuel economy is poor.
At more than 4,500 pounds, the Land Cruiser weighs about as much as
two Ford Escorts and gets 12 miles per gallon in the city and 14 on
the highway. The Toyota got around 11 during a rigorous test outing
that sampled a variety of driving conditions. Towing capacity is
3,500 pounds, increasing to 5,000 pounds with the optional towing
package.
   Inside are firm, flat, cloth seats, including a bench seat in
the back that splits 50-50 and folds down for extra cargo space. It
offered good legroom even with the front bucket seats all the way
back. Three good-sized adults can fit in the back, close but
comfortable.
   Another three can fit in the optional third seat, though it's a
bit lower to the floor and tighter. This bench seat also splits
50-50 for cargo handling and folds up against the side walls, a
good place to keep it when not in use so the headrests don't block
the rear-window view. The spare tire was stowed outside the
vehicle, beneath the cargo floor.
   Fit and finish was good on the test vehicle. A newcomer also
notices the extra visibility one gets from riding so high, and with
that, the usefulness of the handles above each door when climbing
in and out.
   Base price is $21,998. The Grand Wagoneer is about $28,000 and
the Range Rover is over $38,000.
   Consumer Reports magazine did not have a listing of owner
complaints on the Land Cruiser.

<HEAD>Morris Dees: Scourge of KKK Sees Shades of Gray</HEAD>

   Black-and-white. Usually it means plain,
explicit, uncomplicated.
   But in his law office, where the white pages of statute books
were blackened by a firebomb, Morris Dees somehow keeps seeing
shades of gray.
   Dees, the founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center and its
chief counsel in trials that have destroyed Ku Klux Klan
organizations, wants to understand his bitter adversaries - even
the ones who've tried to kill him.
   ``A lot of these people have paranoid personalities bred from
basically family problems when they were children,'' he says.
``They're looking for love and affection.''
   ``If you look at a Klan roster, just about everybody ... can be
an exalted something. It makes them feel important.''
   White supremacists chafe at such cool analysis, and at least
three racist groups have put Dees at or near the top of their hit
lists. A display case in his offices holds charred law books and a
melted clock, reminders of the 1983 firebombing by Klansmen.
   In a case set for trial Monday in Portland, Ore., the
53-year-old white Alabama lawyer is suing an organization called
the White Aryan Resistance for allegedly inciting skinheads to
fatally beat an African man there.
   A lawsuit he brought in 1984 in the lynching of a black
teen-ager in Mobile, Ala., resulted in a judgment that bankrupted
the United Klans of America. The victim's mother, Buelah Mae
Donald, received title to the Klan's national headquarters.
   Dees pursued the case with zeal - and yet he wept, along with
others, when one of the killers stood up at the end of the trial
and begged Mrs. Donald's forgiveness.
   ``I just think once you come face-to-face with this person you
stalk, and their families ... that's a catharsis that a lot of
people go through,'' he said.
   Morris Dees grew up, blond-haired and blue-eyed, in Alabama
cotton country.
   When asked the source of the righteous anger that seems to
underlie the law center, he tells a story of his youth.
   He was 16 and his father sent him to accompany a tractor driver
on the farm, a black man named Clarence, to a court appearance.
Clarence had been charged with drunken driving, but Dees believed
his story: ``His car had a tie rod come loose and he'd hit a
concrete median and knocked himself dizzy.''
   The justice of the peace operated out of a store, and during the
``trial,'' Dees said, ``he never quit serving crackers and cheese
and Cokes across the counter.''
   Guilty was the inevitable ruling.
   ``The fine was over $100. Clarence didn't have that kind of
money,'' Dees said. ``I don't know, that kind of set me on wanting
to become a lawyer.''
   Dees graduated from the University of Alabama and its law
school. While still a student, he set up a lucrative birthday cake
delivery service, and later sold books by direct mail. He and a
partner sold the business for a reported $6 million.
   Dees next put his direct-mail skills to work raising millions
for George McGovern's Democratic presidential campaign in 1972,
then used the mailing lists to appeal for help on his own project,
the fledgling Southern Poverty Law Center.
   The center grew out of ``his determination that there was an
enormous gap in legal defense in certain kinds of cases,'' said
Julian Bond, a black civil rights leader from Georgia who became
the center's first board chairman.
   What drives Morris Dees? ``A very well-developed sense of
outrage,'' said Bond, now a professor and broadcaster in
Washington, D.C.
   ``He knows the legal system can be used to right wrongs.''
   The law center, which now has an endowment of $30 million and a
$4 million annual budget, has taken on death penalty, voting
rights, employment discrimination and other cases, but is best
known for hauling the Klan and similar groups into court.
   Klanwatch, a handful of investigators at the Montgomery law
center backed up by informants around the country, produces a
bi-monthly ``Intelligence Report'' on hate group activities, which
is sent to 4,000 police agencies.
   White robes reflected by a fiery cross, the fear reflected on
black faces in the night, in the ``Intelligence Report'' these
stark events are reduced to column upon column of statistics, names
and dates. Black-and-white becomes gray again.
   ``It appears to be good solid information,'' said Lt. Robert
McCulley of the Memphis, Tenn., police. ``Information is hard to
come by. You don't go into a bookstore and walk to the section
labeled `Terrorism.' ''
   To enter the Southern Poverty Law Center, a visitor climbs steps
walled with stone past a granite monument to civil rights martyrs.
The front door is unlocked electronically and, inside, a
receptionist sits at a video security system.
   ``It's a necessary bunker,'' Bond said. ``If you do this work
from the safety of New York City, it's one thing. But if you're
right in the heart of the beast, a sensible person takes
precautions.''
   And Dees does. He varies his route and schedule to and from
work. He avoids alleys.
   ``Demon Dees!'' Louis Beam, a Texas neo-Nazi, once shouted
during questioning by his nemesis in one case. Beam challenged Dees
to a duel.
   Exorcising the demon with a simple gunshot apparently was not
enough for members of The Order, which murdered Denver talk show
host Alan Berg.
   ``The preliminary plan called for kidnapping Dees, interrogating
him, then flaying him - peeling his skin off his body - before
killing him,'' wrote Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt in their book,
``The Silent Brotherhood.''
   In an otherwise even-toned interview, the only strong profanity
came when the soft-spoken Dees was asked if he doesn't expect one
day to become another name on the law center's memorial.
   ``Man, I don't want to be a martyr to anybody's (expletive)
cause,'' he said. ``I didn't get into this thing for a cause.''
   The law center began with a variety of suits: challenging
unhealthy working conditions in textile plants, representing death
row inmates and others.
   Dees first went up against the white supremacists in 1979,
agreeing to represent a black marcher attacked during a peaceful
demonstration in Decatur, Ala. Clubbed by KKK counterdemonstrators,
the man tried to defend himself with a registered gun, Dees said.
An all-white jury convicted him.
   Dees thought back to Clarence, and his day in court: ``Nothing
had really changed.''
   But it was about to. He filed a civil lawsuit against the
Klansmen.
   Evidence uncovered by Klanwatch led to federal indictments
against 10 Klansmen, and the suit ended in a settlement that, among
other things, required the whites to attend a race relations class.
The class was taught earlier this year by the Rev. Joseph Lowery of
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, who is black.
   ``One of the Klansmen,'' Dees said, ``the day of the
demonstration he had a club in his hand ... Eleven years later,
he's standing there holding hands with Dr. Lowery in a prayer.
   ``And saying, `Maybe I was misguided back then, and we could
have solved our problems in a different way.' ''

<HEAD>Free-Speech Claim in Skinhead Case Called `Baloney'; ACLU
Monitoring</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Klan's Nemesis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A white supremacist accused in a lawsuit of inciting skinheads
to commit a racially motivated killing in Portland, Ore., says he
was merely exercising his First Amendment rights.
   The suit, which seeks damages from the group White Aryan
Resistance, or WAR, and four individuals, is merely ``a roundabout
way of cutting off freedom of speech, freedom of association and
even freedom of assembly,'' said Tom Metzger, the organization's
leader and a defendant.
   The Oregon office of the American Civil Liberties Union plans to
monitor the trial, set to begin Monday in Portland.
   Plaintiff's lawyer Morris Dees calls Metzger's claims
``baloney.''
   The civil case follows the criminal conviction of three
skinheads in the 1988 beating death of Mulugeta Seraw, a
27-year-old Ethiopian who was living and working in Portland.
Seraw's skull was fractured with a baseball bat.
   Dees' Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center sued on
behalf of Seraw's estate. In the past, the center has won millions
in judgments by suing hate groups and their leaders, arguing that
they are responsible for damage and injuries done at their behest,
just as a corporation can be held liable for employees' actions.
   The suit contends Metzger and his son John have recruited
skinheads to WAR in recent years, and that through agents they sent
to Portland, they provided a skinhead group called East Side White
Pride with racist materials promoting violence against blacks and
Jews. Seraw's killers were members of East Side White Pride.
   Further, the suit - which was joined by the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith - claims WAR agents were in contact with the
Metzgers in Fallbrook, Calif., met with the skinheads and
encouraged them to harm blacks.
   ``The allegations of personal involvement ... are totally
nonsense,'' Metzger said. ``It's something that Mr. Dees has
dreamed up.''
   Dees said he has letters and phone records linking the Metzgers
and their ``agents'' in Portland, as well as ``a damning
affidavit.'' In it, one of the agents, Michael Barrett, tells of
taking five baseball bats to Portland, of keeping close contact
with the Metzgers, and of meeting with East Side White Pride
skinheads.
   ``We told them to use violence if they got an opportunity, and
to be sure and beat the hell out of the enemy,'' Barrett said in
the affidavit. ``We were telling them what Tom and John Metzger
told us to say.''

<HEAD>30 Years in TV Shadows: Jerry Van Dyke Has First Success in ABC's
`Coach'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Until ABC's ``Coach,'' Jerry Van Dyke was
often in the game but never on a winning team, unable to emerge
from a 30-year shadow cast by his successful brother, Dick Van
Dyke.
   The fame he did achieve was dubious: as the star of one of the
most ridiculed failures in the history of television, ``My Mother
the Car.''
   ``If I waited for something good to come along, I'd never
work,'' Van Dyke said. ``When people talk about bad television, `My
Mother the Car' is the show that pops to mind. There have been
worse shows, but that's the one people remember.''
   It was in 1965, while the ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' remained
one of TV's biggest hits, that Jerry Van Dyke got his first series,
with Ann Sothern as the voice of the mother-car.
   ``I'd just turned down `Gilligan's Island' because I thought it
was ridiculous,'' he recalled.
   He went on to three other series failures: ``Accidental
Family,'' ``The Headmaster'' and ``13 Queens Boulevard.''
   Meanwhile, his older brother won six Emmys and TV immortality.
   ``I have an act I take on the road,'' Jerry Van Dyke said.
``That's what saved me. I don't know how most actors make a
living.''
   Van Dyke said the part of the handyman in the now-defunct comedy
series ``Newhart'' was written for him, but CBS nixed the deal.
   But his persistence finally is paying off. He was nominated this
year for an Emmy as best supporting actor in a comedy series for
his role as Luther Van Dam, the befuddled assistant to Craig T.
Nelson in ``Coach.'' Although he didn't win, the nomination was a
boost.
   ``The Emmy nomination did a world of good for my confidence,''
he said. ``I've always known I was good, but if other people don't
think so, it can hurt your confidence.
   ``It was a matter of not only being not successful but being in
my brother's shadow. He had one of the best shows on television,
and I had to compete with that. It hurt my career. I made my TV
debut on his show, and it did me a whole lot of good. It got me in
the public eye, and CBS signed me. But when I failed to produce, it
hurt me. Then I stayed Dick Van Dyke's brother. I always knew if I
had some success that I'd no longer be thought of as Dick Van
Dyke's brother.''
   It was thought for a while that Dick Van Dyke would make an
appearance in a two-part ``Coach'' episode as   brother Luther
hasn't seen for 30 years. But the role may be changed to that of a
former best friend.
   The part of Luther was created for Van Dyke by writer-producer
Barry Kemp, who also created ``Newhart.'' Van Dyke had discovered
Kemp in Phoenix and supported and encouraged him until he became a
writer for ``Taxi.''
   He met Kemp during what he calls a ``really bad period of my
life and career'' 10 or 12 years ago.
   ``I was divorced,'' he said. ``I didn't have anything. My career
was shot. I was working in joints. This kid came to me and said he
was a writer.''
   He liked Kemp's material so much that he put him up at his home
in Los Angeles and paid him a salary.
   Although Luther in ``Coach'' was written for him, Van Dyke still
had to bring the character to life.
   ``When you start on a show, where do you find a character?'' he
said. ``You don't know where he's going to go. He's the world's
most negative man, but that doesn't make a character. In some ways,
he's comparable to me. We're the same age, his life is very similar
to mine. Luther says, `I never got married because I was afraid of
getting divorced. I never became head coach because I was afraid of
losing.'
   ``He has no relationships. He lives with a bird. He doesn't want
to make any waves. He likes the status quo. He has a cloud over his
head. Yet, in his own little world, he's happy-go-lucky.''
   Van Dyke's career began during four years as an entertainer in
the Air Force. He won ``The All Air Force Talent Show'' twice,
which led to two appearances on ``The Ed Sullivan Show.''
   His live act has earned him headliner status in Las Vegas, Reno,
Lake Tahoe and Atlantic City, and he also has appeared in a number
of movies and the humorous miniseries ``Fresno.''
   When he's not working, he and his family live on a 500-acre farm
in Arkansas.

   As U.S. reservists ship out for the unknown in the Saudi desert,
the families left behind struggle with uncertainties of their own.
   How to put food on the table.
   How to pay medical bills and mortgages.
   How to be a single parent or a surrogate one.
   Saddam Hussein and the Persian Gulf are worlds away, but for
these families the upheaval in the Middle East has hit very close

   While Charles Fells serves his country, his pregnant wife,
Linda, is at war with the system.
   Pvt. 1 Fells, 23, of the 423rd medical detachment, is training
at Fort Drum, N.Y., and will ship out to Saudi Arabia any day.
   Last month, Fells lost his job as a food service manager when a
hotel restaurant closed. Shortly after he left home, the
Poughkeepsie couple's suspicions were confirmed: Mrs. Fells, 25,
already the mother of 15-month-old David, was two months' pregnant.
   In financial trouble and lacking health insurance, Mrs. Fells
looked to the government for help.
   She's still looking.
   Her days are spent being shunted from one military bureaucracy
to another: wondering what benefits she's entitled to, what forms
to fill out, where to get prenatal care, where to take her son in a
medical emergency.
   ``I've been on the phone, all day and all night, for days now.
It's not accomplishing anything: just making me feel sicker and
sicker,'' Mrs. Fells said. ``They keep telling me they're going to
help me, but I haven't gotten any, yet.''
   An army hospital told her many of its doctors had been activated
and there was no one left to see her. Private hospitals and clinics
demanded hundreds of dollars up front because she has no insurance.
   ``I can't sleep at night; I'm really upset,'' Mrs. Fells said.
``I've been dizzy every day. I'm worried about the baby: worried
that, because of my nerves, something's going to go wrong.''

   Jay Black recalls the day he felt he'd become a casualty of the
Persian Gulf conflict. It was three or four weeks ago; Black is too
harried these days to remember exact dates, or how much he's been
through.
   ``I've yelled and screamed and cried more in the past few weeks
than I can remember,'' Black said.
   On the day in question, he returned from the grocery store to
find his year-old son, Billy, and the contents of the refrigerator
on the kitchen floor. His wife, Sgt. Amy Durand-Black, home on a
weekend furlough from Army reserve duty in Augusta, Ga., was in the
bathroom throwing up, felled by the flu.
   It was supposed to have been a special weekend, one of the
couple's last together before Mrs. Durand-Black, 27, left for
reserve duty at a California medical clinic.
   Almost overnight, Black, 29, has become a single parent forced
to live without his wife - the family's main breadwinner, a manager
at an Atlanta theater company - on a budget that could not cover
the rent and mounting bills.
   As a result, he's had to leave the small home he and his wife
rented for $385 a month and move with his son and the family dog,
Flash, to his grandparents' house in Rome, Ga. What used to be a
15-minute drive to his bookkeeping job at the same theater company
is now a 120-mile roundtrip commute every day.
   ``I've seen my whole marriage flash before my eyes. All my
belongings are now in a 10-by-10 storage cubicle,'' Black said.
``My feelings have run the gamut from patriotism to hatred of the
Army.''
   Black said he has become adept at juggling his creditors,
telling them, ``My wife was activated, and I'm sunk.''
   As Black tries to deal with the fact that his wife could be gone
for several years, he and Billy are relying on friends to help them
cope.
   ``I've got some wonderful friends who I've leaned on very
heavily,'' Black said. ``I know I'm a terrible imposition on
everyone. I guess my friends feel like they're doing their part for
the war effort.''

   Patsy Bell and her family live paycheck to paycheck. Now that
her husband has been called to active duty in the Persian Gulf, the
paychecks have stopped.
   ``It'll be December or January until we get our checks from the
Army,'' said Ms. Bell, 28, mother of 2-year-old Kathy. ``We had
$145 left after he bought everything with his last paycheck. We
don't have any savings. Most of the money would go to our bills and
diapers and milk.''
   Sgt. Frank Bell was among 141 reservists of the Las Cruces,
N.M.-based 281st Transportation Company called up Sept. 20. For his
wife, adjusting to life as the head of her household is
frightening. Her husband, an elementary school teacher in nearby
Lordsburg, has always paid the bills and handled any problems at
home.
   ``We'll make do with what we have and do without what we can't
afford. In the long run, we'll have to apply for food stamps,'' she
said.
   Bell's orders were for 90 days, but Ms. Bell, like many
reservists' wives in this mining community of 10,000, is preparing
for the long haul.
   ``I called up to the welfare office to see if they could help me
find a job,'' she said. ``I've been trying to look for a job, but
as a secretary, most of the money would go for babysitting and gas.
So I wouldn't be left with much of anything.''

   The fall has erased more than $1.66 billion of the company's
market value and led the Australian Stock Exchange to open an

   The children of soldiers do battle on the homefront with the
heartbreak of separation, the longing for an absent parent's arms
and the fear that Daddy or Mommy might never return.
   When they write about their feelings at having parents leave for
possible war in the Persian Gulf, pain rises from the paper like
heat from the desert.
   Such small voices; such big fear.
   ``I'm afraid for my Dad,'' writes Natalie, 9. ``I want him to
come home. I always wonder what Dad's thinking. Is he thinking
about me? Or is he thinking about war? Will he be safe? Or will he
be slain? These things puzzle me.
   ``On the outside, I laugh at the jokes made about Housein. On
the inside, I feel like crying. My eyes fill with tears when anyone
mentions my father. Is the weather horrible? Or is it livable? I
just want Dad home and to forget abou the gulf crises.''
   ``I hope they don't have to fight,'' 7-year-old Justin writes.
``If they do fight, I hope my Dad dos'nt get killed. I have two
brothers that miss him too.''
   Natalie, Justin and 15 other kids at Bartow Elementary School in
Savannah, Ga., have joined the ``Hero Club'' formed by counselor
Mac Merritt to help them cope. Their writings are part of a club
exercise.
   ``They're good at hiding their feelings. But the more we talk,
the more they talk,'' Merritt said. In these little lives, there is
much to work through, he has found.
   ``I'm afraid that my Dad might die,'' Stephen, 9, worries. ``I
wish he was home. I hope he survives.''
   ``I would like for them to have more food &amp; water,'' Narria, 10,
writes. ``I would not like my father to get killed. I wouldn't like
my father to get very sick.''
   ``I am worried about if war breaks out and gun fireing starts.
What kind of food is he eating? I would like for them to have more
water in Saudi Arabia,'' Valerie, 9, writes. Then an afterthought,
above a drawing of an army vehicle baking under no fewer than eight
suns: ``It seems like there is alot of suns over there in Saudi
Arabia as hot as it is there.''
   Darin, 6, worries that his father is worried, and offers
reassurance: ``We are okay Love Darin I have not got sent to
prinsipal.'' In his picture, his father parachutes from a plane
into the desert.
   ``Dear Dad, How are you doing? How is the food down there? Have
you shot guns any?'' Danielle, 9, writes. ``I wish you wouldnt.''
In her drawing, a smiling sun hovers over her dad.
   A smiling man with a gun shoots at a target in 7-year-old
Larry's drawing. ``I wish my dad will not git killid,'' he writes.
   ``I hope he is okay,'' 6-year-old Sara writes. ``Wat is he
doing? Wy do they have to do this? I am wanting them to stop
evreythag.''
   Below her words, Sara drew a blazing sun, a wolf, and her Dad in
desert fatigues. ``Sometimes I wonder,'' reads the balloon above
his head.
   When anxiety and fear become overwhelming, they spill out on the
paper as hatred and violence. ``Powerful fright feelings,'' Merritt
calls them.
   ``I hate the irookys because they toke over Kuwait. My father is
over there. I hate Sudam Hussian, because he started all this by
getting into Kuwait,'' Jason, 7, writes.
   Chris, 10, draws a picture of a man with a knife protruding from
his stomach. ``Suddam Hussien'' reads the label above the man's
head. ``Blood'' is labeled and marked with an arrow.
   ``Every day I wonder when my dad is coming home. I also wonder
if Saddam Hussien is crazy enough to kill himself. I wish he
wolld,'' Chris writes.
   ``I HATE SADOM HUSSIAM!'' 10-year-old Jamia prints in capital
letters across the top of her paper.
   Below that, in still bigger print: ``I LOVE MY FATHER!''

<HEAD>Center Helps Reserve Families in Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Gulf-Families at Home</HEAD>

   Help is a phone call away for the thousands of
women, men and children who become instant military dependents in
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   More than 700 callers a month get advice at the Family Support
Operations Center at Fort Totten, Queens, home of the nation's
largest Army reserve command.
   The 77th Army Reserve Command serves 14,000 soldiers and their
families; 334 of them have been activated. But the center will try
to help callers from anywhere - even from other military branches.
   Its toll-free number, good in New York, Connecticut and New
Jersey, ``is a lifesaver; a lot of these people can't afford a
long-distance phone call,'' said Paul M. Silverman, a civilian who
is family support coordinator.
   Sgt. Mary Lou Bohrnmann, a reserve spokeswoman, said most of the
callers need quick advice or commiseration. About 5 percent are
overwhelmed; a few call four or five times a day to hear a
reassuring, friendly voice.
   ``They're worried about keeping a roof over their head or money
to pay for food,'' said Sgt. 1st Class Patricia Payne.
   ``They get kind of panicky,'' said Master Sgt. George Frangos.
   Most callers find out about the center from commanding officers
or other military families. An information packet also is mailed
automatically when a soldier is activated.
   Payne, Frangos, and Silverman - aided by six to 10 volunteers,
plus, on weekends, seven or eight non-active reservists - guide
neophytes through the military bureaucracy.
   They'll explain benefits. They'll help when a departing soldier
forgets to sign a check or a power-of-attorney form.
   They'll sic lawyers on an unyielding bank that refuses to lower
a reservist's mortgage rate or a landlord who threatens to evict a
suddenly strapped family.
   They'll send a financial planner to help the spouse who, until
now, never wrote the checks. They can even obtain a one-day,
emergency food supply - although no one has asked for it, so far.
   And when the stress builds up, the staff tells soldiers and
their families they're not alone.
   ``One soldier was going off, he was 21 or 22. I felt so sorry
for the young man. He was scared to death,'' said Payne.
   He confided that he planned to spend his last night of freedom
with his buddies. Payne, concerned about his panic, urged him to
spend the night with his mother.
   ``I usually don't take the problems home. But I saw my son in
him,'' said Payne. ``I called him at 10 o'clock that night. His mom
answered. He said, 'I stayed home because I had a feeling you would
be checking up on me.'''
   Payne, a widow with five grandchildren and three children,
relates to her callers. Before she was activated, she worked at a
bank to support herself and her youngest son, who's a senior in
college. Now, they're struggling to make ends meet.
   ``We had scraped up every penny to put him through college. He
called me and said, `Ma, should I come back home?''' But she
wouldn't hear of it.
   ``I can help everybody's problems here,'' said Payne. ``But when
I go home, I can't help mine.''
   ``This has made us all more aware of our responsibilities,
too,'' she said. ``There are certain things we have to get in
order.''

   A decade ago, Moscow was a city of boasts, of
sure-fire government plans, of blithe assertions that the Soviet
Union would lead the world to a better society.
   Today, it is a city of cynicism, sometimes of despair. Talk is
of just getting through the winter, of keeping bare necessities on
store shelves, of somehow reforming a strangled economy before it
collapses into chaos.
   Recent meetings with top Soviet officials and a wide range of
workers, farmers and professionals suggest a darkening national
mood that takes little account of the country's enduring assets.
   From gilded Kremlin reception rooms to angry street
demonstrations, there is little mention of the nation's rich
natural resources, its literate and educated workers, its high
technology and huge internal market. All could be important engines
of perestroika, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plan to revive the
economy.
   Instead, Soviets point with growing alarm to shortages of food
and almost everything else, and the absence of any serious sign
that things will improve soon.
   Life is hard as winter approaches. Despite the theoretical
promise of perestroika, prosperity seems far away.
   ---
   The display cases are almost bare in the small, poorly lighted
food store on Tverskaya Street, one of Moscow's busiest avenues.
Today, the store is rationing bread: one kilogram (2.2 pounds) per
customer.
   An elderly man, profiting from the new freedom of speech,
accosts a group of American visitors: ``It's the Communist Party
that's responsible for all of this! Look at the empty shelves!''
   Muscovites say milk is still plentiful in state stores, but that
finding anything else is a roll of the dice. The severe bread
shortages of a few weeks ago are over, but decent meat and many
vegetables are rare.
   In the cavernous GUM department store on Red Square, many stalls
once crowded with goods are closed off by metal grates. The goods
may have been shoddy five years ago, but at least they were there.
   Such shortages are common throughout the country.
   ``Actually, we spend a lot less time waiting in line these
days,'' said a woman in Leningrad, Russia's second-largest city.
``Now there's nothing to buy, so we just stay home.''
   ---
   Nikolai Petrakov, one of Gorbachev's top political advisers,
puts it point-blank: ``The economy, to all intents and purposes,
has ceased to exist.''
   The declaration seems somewhat melodramatic. Outside the window
is not an arid plain, but a cacophony of trucks and buses. Hurrying
workers and shoppers compete for space on the rainy sidewalks.
   Petrakov thinks he knows what the future looks like. The
government will make a start on economic revival with its
much-debated 500-day plan, Petrakov says, and predicts the
transition to a Western-style market economy will be complete in 10
years.
   Others dwell more on the problems. Alexander Yakovlev, a senior
Gorbachev aide, admits readily that reforming the Soviet system is
far harder than he imagined.
   He says it's fine to plan things like a modern real estate
market and effective banks, but how to do it in a country where no
one knows what land prices should be and only ``two to three
people'' really understand the Western banking and credit system?
   Many people ask how authorities will persuade frightened,
conservative bureaucrats to give innovators the chance to make
money in new ways and resuscitate the economy in the process.
   ---
   At the Ray of Lenin collective farm outside Moscow, the chairman
granted that Soviet agriculture is less productive than U.S. farms.
He sees the solution in importing American experts and studying
U.S. methods.
   He opposes abolishing the whole concept of collective farms, the
Soviet system in which families join in tilling land they do not
own and receive wages in proportion to their work.
   Later, in his neat cottage, one of the farmers expressed very
different ideas. People will work really hard only if they own
their land, he said.
   He said he tried to talk the farm chairman, in the spirit of
perestroika, into one little innovation: leasing him one of the
collective farm's greenhouses.
   If he could make it more productive, the farmer said, he would
earn extra money for his family and the farm could learn somethinge techniques.
   The chairman 
about greenhoussaid no.
   ---
   Gorbachev's policy of glasnost has brought breathtaking changes
to politics.
   Street-corner orators denounce one politician or another as
policemen stroll by unconcerned. Gorbachev and his ministers must
defend themselves before angry legislators who want to know
everything, from what personal privileges the leaders enjoy to how
they will reform the economy.
   This looks at first like robust democracy. But some Soviets see
the whole affair, especially the raucous parliament debates
televised nationwide, as something else: another
cooked-up-in-the-Kremlin plan to create the illusion of progress
while the hopes of consumers are put on hold again.
   People have learned to watch carefully, y
takeover. To many observers, including some Western diplomats, the
most likely outcome is far less sensational: a slow, painful road
to a market economy, pocked with problems but as inevitable as the
laws of supply and demand.
   Everyone agrees time is of the essence. With every delay, rumors
spread, resolve weakens and fear of anarchy mounts. Anarchists have
a long history in Russia, and fear of chaos and the collapse of
authority are widespread.
   ---
   In a light rain, as sunset nears, 60,000 people march just
outside Red Square. They hold banners demanding the dismissal of
Gorbachev's prime minister, Nikolai Ryzhkov, for economic
incompetence.
   A woman whose sign reads ``Down With Soviet Power'' says reform
must be speedy.
   ``Something must be done!'' she cries. ``Ryzhkov can't cope. In
the United States, if the government ever faced anything like this,
it would have to commit suicide.''
   Behind her, another group marches in ominous silence, under the
black flag of anarchists.

   The audience is down, the competition from cable
is rising. Despite the heady success of ``The Civil War'' series,
PBS has its problems, but it also has a plan to deal with them.
   Public television has appointed its first programming mogul,
responsible for picking the shows, scheduling them and promoting
them.
   Take a meeting, Big Bird.
   Jennifer Lawson, the chief program executive, will be able to
give faster answers to program proposals, speeding up what has been
a cumbersome decision-making process, a PBS board member says.
   Producers of cultural and entertainment shows who would have
gone to PBS in past years now have cable networks as a market for
their wares, particularly the Arts &amp; Entertainment and Discovery
networks.
   ``There are now so many more people looking for good programs
that we're not the only opportunity that people have, as we used to
be,'' says the board member, Henry P. Becton Jr., president of
WGBH-TV in Boston.
   ``We need to be able to be more responsive, to give quicker and
more definitive answers, to take more risks in order to have access
to the best people and ideas.''
   He said it's likely the board, meeting next month, will approve
the final step in the plan that shifts $105.5 million from various
sources to a single program and promotion fund administered by
Lawson, PBS' executive vice president for national programming and
promotion.
   That will complete the process by which she has become the PBS
equivalent of moguls like NBC's Brandon Tartikoff - in charge of
program selection, scheduling and promotion.
   In olden days, public TV stations chose and helped pay for about
half of the national prime-time schedule through a voting process
run by PBS' Station Program Cooperative. Come November, that
process will be history.
   Although Lawson will pick programs, she will consult a committee
that includes PBS and public TV station executives and, in some
cases, minority and independent producers, she says.
   ``It will not be me making decisions in a vacuum,'' she says.
   Lawson, who has spoken of experimenting with educational game
shows and bringing more children's programs to public TV, says the
full impact of the change probably won't be felt until the 1992-93
season.
   That's because many program projects now on the boards have been
funded for this season and the next, although next season's
schedule will give an idea of what's to come, she says.
   But the new system will allow better focus and planning, she
says: ``It helps us move faster and it helps us move with more
intelligence. Before, with the (program cooperative) marketplace,
the process itself made the decisions.
   ``It was a voting on a series of programs without putting them
in any context and looking at what that does to shape our profile.
The new system helps us react faster to changes in the media
environment.''
   It's ``no secret whatsover'' that PBS ratings have fallen off,
she says, even though 24-city ratings for ``The Civil War'' -
national ratings are due this week - averaged a 9.1, the highest in
PBS' history. The network's overall ratings dropped 3 percent in
just the past year.
   When trying to lure viewers back, it sometimes pays to
advertise. Lawson, wearing her program executive's hat, did that
last month.
   PBS followed its ``Civil War'' telecasts with a one-week, $2
million ``Showcase Week'' advertising campaign on the commercial
networks and cable TV, touting PBS' fall schedule of programs.
   The Sept. 30-Oct. 6 campaign, plugging such series as
``Masterpiece Theatre,'' ``The American Experience'' and ``Live
From Lincoln Center,'' wasn't a first for PBS, Lawson said:
   ``Some years ago, the Ford Foundation did provide some funds for
some limited advertising,'' she said.
   But the new campaign was PBS' first in at least a decade, she
said, and was ordered up ``because we really want to do as much as
we can with our resources to highlight what we're doing, and make
it as visible as possible.''
   PBS does a lot of show-promotion on its own 338 stations, she
notes, ``but we feel we're preaching to the converted. We want to
go beyond that and bring new people in.''
   Another sign of changing times at PBS: It may take a leaf from
ABC and NBC and become co-owner of a cable service.
   It's studying the idea of starting a separate educational cable
service with the Discovery Channel, which serves 52.1 million
homes.
   But the main event at PBS now is its shift to a program
``czar.'' And that hasn't occurred without sounds of alarm from
public TV executives who worry that too much power is going into
one person's hands.
   One of the chief worriers, William F. Baker, is president of
WNET-TV in New York. His station has been a major producer of
national shows, among them ``The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour,''
``Nature'' and ``Great Performances.''
   He wouldn't want a return to the old program-picking system,
``not at all ... the old system was cumbersome, and we're happy to
do away with it.''
   But he's concerned, he says, that with the new system ``you have
the risk of having a kind of common central taste.'' And that the
system may not take into account the complexities of getting
funding for programs.
   Baker, a PBS board member, says what he worries most about ``is
that big producing stations, such as WNET, have millions of dollars
committed in advance to create these programs, and if PBS doesn't
help support those things we've already committed to, they could
literally destroy the major producing entities.
   ``You just don't make these big shows, commit to them today and
make them tomorrow. And that's one of our biggest concerns. It can
be very destructive unless that is realized.
   ``There are some indications that they (PBS officials)
understand that, and will realize it. But that's one of our biggest
worries. And that, frankly, is my primary worry.''
   WGBH's Becton, whose station produces nearly a third of PBS'
prime-time series, among them ``Masterpiece Theater'' and ``Nova,''
admits to having early reservations about the centralization of
program-picking power at PBS.
   Unlike Baker, though, his concerns aren't couched in terms of
potential doom. Far from it.
   He said he's been working to ``make sure we had some safeguards,
some checks and balances in this new system. I'm now pretty
satisfied they're in place, and it's a good plan. I'm quite
enthusiastic about it.''
   PBS needs that centralized power now, he adds: ``We need to be
able to make quicker decisions (for program producers and
stations). We need to be able to fund things that are a little more
adventurous, if you will.
   ``The old system was good at approving programs that pleased a
lot of people a little bit, but not so good at finding a program
that might have been more unique, had more of an individual vision,
or whatever.
   ``And I think we need more of that at this point.''

   Oil prices took another steep dive on the
futures market, falling more than $3 per barrel as concerns about
war and supply problems dissipated.
   ``The so-called war premium is being eaten away,'' said
Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   Contracts for November delivery of light sweet crude oil closed
$3.14 lower at $33.95 Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Crude contracts for later months all dropped, most by $1.50 per

   WASHINGTON (AP) - State energy officials and industry
representatives were told there are adequate supplies of heating
oil for this winter, but some worried about possible shortages if
there is a glitch in the system or increased tensions in the
Mideast.
   ``We don't think there is going to be a supply problem this
winter,'' Calvin Kemp, director of the Energy Information
Administration, said Tuesday at a conference on this winter's fuel
outlook. But officials cautioned that the supply picture could
change.

   TOKYO (AP) - A government support package helped propel Tokyo
stocks to their biggest one-day jump in history but left uncertain
prospects for an extended rebound from the worst market decline in
more than 30 years.
   The closely watched Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
leaped 2,676.55 points, or 13.24 percent, to 22,898.41 on Tuesday
after the Ministry of Finance announced emergency measures to shore

   NEW YORK (AP) - After four years of investigation and innuendo,
federal allegations of rampant lawbreaking by junk bond financier
Michael Milken will be aired publicly for the first time at a
special hearing beginning next week.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood ordered the unusual proceeding
Tuesday after lawyers for Milken and the government failed to agree
on a way to avoid further delays in sentencing the former Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. executive.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Sales of new homes fell 1.4 percent in August,
the government said.
   In response to Tuesday's report from the Commerce Department,

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Farmers should prepare themselves for lower
target prices, as Congress looks for ways to cut the agriculture
budget by $13 billion over the next five years, farm organization
officials say.
   Government officials said that the cuts would be painful,
although no one could give details yet on how the cut agreed to by
White House and congressional negotiators to reduce the deficit
would be accomplished.

   SEATTLE (AP) - In the eyes of corporate executives, Seattle, the
Northwest's biggest city is the best place in the nation to locate
a business, elbowing out Atlanta for the top spot.
   Seattle had finished second last year behind Atlanta in the
annual survey by the commercial real estate firm Cushman &amp;
Wakefield. Atlanta dropped to sixth this year.
   Second place in this year's survey went to Sacramento, Calif.,
which was 15th last year, while Portland, Ore., moved up from 27th
place to third. Rounding out the top 10 were Norfolk, Va.; San
Diego; Atlanta; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas-Fort Worth; Minneapolis-St.
Paul; and Tampa, Fla.

   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - A manufacturer of the Army's main tactical
field radio was ordered to pay $3.8 million for conspiring to
defraud the government on defense contracts by falsifying
reliability test results.
   E-Systems Inc. of Dallas received the sentence Tuesday from U.S.
District Judge William Terrell Hodges after formally pleading
guilty to a three-count criminal information.
   Prosecutors charged the company repeatedly altered performance
records and concealed repairs and defects in tests of the field
radios to ensure the Army would accept and pay for them.

   NEW YORK (AP) - American troops in the Middle East are getting
some free cigarettes courtesy of two tobacco companies, but smoking
critics are denouncing the giveaways as a ploy to hook a new
generation of soldiers.
   Philip Morris U.S.A., the nation's leading cigarette maker, said
Tuesday it had donated 2 million smokes to America's Persian Gulf
forces in response to letters from the soldiers themselves.
   Critics say tobacco companies have repeatedly taken advantage of
wars to hook soldiers on their products.

   Nervous traders, mindful of the continuing Persian Gulf crisis,
took their profits and cut short a two-day surge on Wall Street
Tuesday.
   The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 industrials, up about 25
points for the first half of the day, closed down 10.64 at
2,505.20.
   The dollar dropped against all major currencies in uneventful
U.S. trading after moving mostly higher overseas. Gold prices
skidded on European and Asian markets, but they gained modestly in
the United States.
   Precious metals posted an impressive turnaround from weeks of
sharp loss. Grains and soybeans were higher. Cattle futures were
lower. Pork futures were sharply higher.
   Bonds were higher.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices are showing an ability to fall as
sharply on the hint of peace as they can rise on the hint of war.
   Crude oil futures plummeted more than $3 per barrel on the
volatile New York Mercantile Exchange on Tuesday, a day after
falling more than $2 a barrel.
   The back-to-back dives left traders wondering where the bottom
would be, just as they had wondered last week how high oil could
rise as it moved into the $40 range.
   ``The so-called war premium is being eaten away,'' said
Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   Contracts for November delivery of light sweet crude oil closed
$3.14 lower at $33.95 on Tuesday. Crude contracts for later months
all dropped, most by $1.50 per barrel, their maximum limit for the
day.
   Oil's fall this week started off in response to more moderate
overtures from President Bush and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
Once crude began sliding, it dragged down futures prices for home
heating oil and unleaded gasoline.
   Heating oil fell 8 cents to 92.03 cents per gallon Tuesday for
November delivery. All later contract months dropped by the day's
limit of 4 cents a gallon.
   Unleaded gasoline fell 6.98 cents to 86.93 cents per gallon for
November delivery. All later contract months fell by their limit of
4 cents a gallon.
   Natural gas fell 2.9 cents to $1.88 per 1,000 cubic feet for
November contracts. Most other contract months were lower.
   As the tough talk by the Gulf protagonists has faded, the
world's oil supply picture has improved. Increased crude output
from Saudi Arabia has begun to reach European markets, easing the
early strain from the Iraq and Kuwait oil embargo.
   ``There was a window there where we had the shortfall from Iraq
and Kuwait and we weren't really seeing the increase in OPEC
production,'' Hittle said. ``That window happened to coincide with
the fieriest rhetoric.''
   After the futures market closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum
Institute released a report showing that the nation's crude
stockpile fell sharply last week. Gasoline stocks were up slightly,
while stocks of distillates, which include heating oil, were down
slightly, API said in its statistics for the week that ended Sept.
28.
   Crude oil stocks fell to 354.6 million barrels, from 364 million
barrels a week earlier, although they remained above their level of
333.3 million barrels a year earlier.
   Gasoline stocks rose to 223.9 million barrels, up from 222.3
million barrels a week earlier and 223.7 million barrels a year
earlier. Stocks of distillates, which include heating oil, fell to
134.8 million barrels, from 136.5 million barrels a week earlier,
although they remained above their level of 122.9 million barrels a
year ago.
   The nation's refineries ran at 91.2 percent of capacity, down
from 92.8 percent a week earlier but up from 89.4 percent a year
ago, the API said.

   Health-conscious consumers are on a low-fat
buying craze and major dairy companies are having a cow about how
to shed tons of fatty leftovers squeezed out of milk, ice cream and
other products.
   ``As we take more fat out of our products, which consumers are
wanting more and more, you have to have a place to put it - which
we don't,'' said William D. Fischer, president and chief operating
officer of Dean Foods, the nation's second-largest dairy.
   ``We're losing half a million dollars a month'' by selling the
fat for less than it costs to remove it from the milk, he said
Tuesday.
   Dean Foods, based in suburban Franklin Park, produces about 4.4
billion pounds of fat annually and is selling it at a loss while
looking for some other way to use it.
   The largest U.S. dairy, Borden Inc. of New York, faces similar
problems, although it keeps no detailed records of the amount of
money lost this way, said Jim McKinley, manager of financial
communications.
   ``It's a problem that affects the entire dairy industry,''
McKinley said. ``Sales of low-fat products have been increasing at
a higher rate than other products.''
   Skim and low-fat milk sales accounted for about 40 percent of
the market 10 years ago, but now comprise about 60 percent,
industry analysts said.
   ``It reflects a changing consumer preference for low-fat
products,'' said John McMillan, food-industry analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. ``Fifteen years ago,
nobody bought low-fat and skim milk.''
   The turnaround occurred so quickly, officials said, that dairy
makers were taken by surprise and had no alternatives for getting
rid of the fat except to continue selling most of it for use in the
production of butter. Butter, however, is also shunned by health-
and cost-conscious consumers.
   ``There's now more butter on the market than we can possibly
consume,'' Fischer said. ``There's also a glut worldwide.''
   The industry has asked the federal government to ease its
predicament with legislation aimed at providing incentives for
farmers to breed cows producing low-fat milk with more protein.
   Farmers currently have no incentive to change breeding patterns
because, under federal pricing guidelines, they receive the same
amount of money no matter what fat content milk has.
   ``The new way would reward farmers for producing milk with more
protein and less fat,'' Fischer said.
   The Agriculture Department supports such legislation because its
budget is taking a beating after buying surplus butter in a
multibillion-dollar dairy price-support program.
   The government this year reported 397.5 million pounds of
stockpiled butter, purchased at a cost of $502.6 million under the
support program in which it annually buys about 10 percent of
national dairy production.
   Those costs and the price of storing the dairy products are so
high the government began giving them away to needy families in the
early 1980s. But the government began having problems giving it
away because the stockpile was so huge, said Kelly Shipp, a USDA
spokesman.
   Giveaways to schools and other agencies now help reduce the
stockpile each year, but butter still is being produced at such a
rate that the government suffers huge losses, Ms. Shipp said.
   Changes in the government's milk-marketing rules are years away,
however, she said.
   ``Unfortunately, the rules say we have to have a nationwide
hearing process and farmer referendum before we make changes,'' Ms.
Shipp said. ``We're moving as fast as we possibly can. We can't
just go out and change things tomorrow because we want to.''
   Dairy companies grumble that even after any possible changes are
drafted, it would take years before farmers could breed cows to
produce low-fat milk.
   ``This is a problem we've had for years, and each year that goes
by without a solution costs us money,'' McKinley said.

<HEAD>After Four Years, Allegations To Get Public Airing</HEAD>

   Michael Milken's lawyers could get their first
crack at their client's main accuser - ex-con inside trader Ivan
Boesky - at a hearing on allegations the government says show
Milken deserves years in prison.
   After four years of investigation and innuendo, the government's
most celebrated Wall Street fraud case finally will get a public
airing starting next week at the special hearing ordered by U.S.
District Judge Kimba Wood.
   The government requested the hearing to try to substantiate
charges made in a pre-sentencing memorandum urging a stiff prison
sentence against Milken based on an alleged history of wrongdoing
far beyond six felonies he has admitted.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll said Tuesday the government
would limit its inquiry at the hearing to four transactions by
Milken alleging insider trading and other wrongdoing in the
mid-1980s involving Caesar's World Inc., MGM-UA Entertainment Co.,
Storer Communications Inc. and Wickes Cos.
   The Caesar's transaction involves new charges of insider
trading. The three others were included in the government's
original 98-count fraud and racketeering indictment against Milken
handed up in March 1989.
   Wood last week had asked the government to limit its
presentation to under five transactions of more than 35 included in
its presentencing memo, including allegations of insider trading,
stock parking, and illegal payoffs to clients and money managers.
Milken's lawyers, in a lengthy rebuttal, deny most of the claims.
   The government's sentencing memo issued last week portrayed
Milken as a systematic lawbreaker who rigged the financial markets
for his own benefit.
   The defense said the 44-year-old Milken was a hard-working and
honest businessman and philanthropist who has acknowledged his
mistakes and shouldn't be punished for unproven crimes.
   Carroll said the government had not decided whether to call to
the stand Boesky, the former arbitrager who implicated Milken in
wrongdoing shortly after he admitted in November 1986 to running a
widespread insider trading network.
   If Boesky testifies, it would be the first time defense lawyers
will meet Milken's chief accuser face to face. Other potential
witnesses are former Milken associates at Drexel's Beverly Hills,
Calif., high-yield bond department, Boesky associates and others
said to be involved in the alleged illegal transactions.
   Boesky was released in April after two years in federal custody
of a three-year sentence. He has testified publicly once, at the
trial this summer of former stock speculator John A. Mulheren Jr.
   Prosecutors presented a list of 14 witnesses who cooperated with
government investigators typically in exchange for immunity from
prosecution who may appear at the planned two-week hearing, set to
begin next Tuesday.
   Milken in April pleaded guilty to six felonies including
conspiracy and tax and securities fraud, and agreed to pay $600
million in penalties in a deal settling broader charges. But in its
pre-sentencing memo, the government alleged many more crimes than
those Milken admitted.
   Milken faces a maximum 28 years in prison. His lawyers have
urged the judge to sentence him to community service developing and
running inner-city youth education programs in Los Angeles.
   Wood said the hearing is designed to shed light on Milken's
character to better enable her to devise an appropriate sentence.
Both sides will have 20 hours to present arguments and
cross-examine witnesses as at a trial.
   The hearing further delays the long-awaited sentencing,
originally set for Monday, in the most celebrated case stemming
from the government's Wall Street insider trading investigations
that began in late 1986.
   Milken attorneys are expected to use their presentation time at
the hearing to present character witnesses who would bolster their
request for community service in lieu of prison time.
   Arthur Liman, Milken's lead lawyer, said the hearing would give
the judge the ``benefits of separating the myth of Michael Milken
from the person.''
   The judge said that in sentencing she would discount any
testimony about alleged lawbreaking by Milken other than the four
transactions. She also said she may ask questions about some of the
six felonies to which Milken has pleaded guilty.
   Under federal case law, sentencing judges can consider
unadmitted conduct. Earlier this year, another judge refused to
consider such allegations against former stock speculator Robert
Freeman.

<HEAD>Smoking Critics Rebuke Tobacco Companies for Gulf Cigarette
Giveaway</HEAD>

   War is breaking out in the Persian Gulf but it's
over cigarettes, not oil.
   The antagonists in this battle are U.S. tobacco companies giving
free cigarettes to U.S. forces stationed in the gulf vs.
anti-smoking groups who say the giveaways are a ploy to hook a new
generation of soldiers.
   Philip Morris U.S.A., the nation's leading cigarette maker, said
Tuesday it had donated 2 million smokes to Operation Desert Shield
in response to letters from tobacco-deprived soldiers.
   Larry Glennie, company director of military specialty sales,
said Philip Morris had shipped the 10,000 cartons of Marlboros to
Saudi Arabia on Sept. 26. They were distributed free to ``members
of the Army, Air Force and Marines who have the least access to the
basic comforts of everyday life,'' he said.
   The shipment followed a Sept. 25 announcement by the much
smaller Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. that it planned to send an
undisclosed number of free Kool Milds and Richlands to the U.S.
contingent defending oil-rich Saudi Arabia against a possible Iraqi
attack.
   Smoking critics said the moves subverted a 4-year-old Defense
Department health policy aimed at discouraging cigarette use.
   ``As health organizations, we certainly have to be concerned
about the readiness of our troops,'' said Fran DuMelle, chairwoman
of the Coalition on Smoking or Health, a Washington lobby group.
   ``I think the coalition is principally outraged at the tobacco
industry's attempt to exploit the situation in the Mideast,'' she
said. ``In every war in the last 40 years, the industry has used
the concept of free cigarettes to hook a new generation of
smokers.''
   Steven Dickinson, a spokesman for the American Cancer Society,
said he wasn't surprised by the giveaways, but questioned why the
Pentagon hadn't taken a public position on the free smokes.
   ``The point is, the Department of Defense has recognized that
smoking is a deterrent to fitness. Here they are playing into the
tobacco companies,'' Dickinson said.
   At the Pentagon, Defense Department spokesman Maj. Douglas Hart
said he would have to check further before he could comment on the
tobacco company announcements.
   ``This is the first I've heard about this, to tell you the
truth,'' Hart said.
   It was unclear whether the free cigarettes violated the
Pentagon's anti-smoking policy, which was begun in 1986 by
then-Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger.
   The policy restricts where soldiers may smoke and subjects
recruits to an aggressive educational campaign to discourage them
from smoking because of what medical authorities have called the
extreme health risks, which include cancer.
   Glennie said Philip Morris had received a number of letters
requesting cigarettes from troops in Operation Desert Shield.
   ``They were having trouble getting cigarettes,'' Glennie said.
He rejected the anti-smoking lobby's criticism.
   ``I don't think there's anything we do that we don't get
criticzed for,'' he said. ``The company felt that since we'd
gotten the letters directly from the front-line troops, we thought
it was the right thing to do.''
   A Philip Morris press statement quoted one unidentified letter
from a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne division as saying, ``We
are not greedy people, just paratroopers unable to get hold of
great cigarettes. So any cigarettes you could send us would make
our stay here much more pleasurable.''
   Another soldier was quoted as saying, ``We came over here with
hardly any notice and most of us are out of tobacco and tired.''
   Philip Morris U.S.A. is part of Philip Morris Companies Inc.,
the world's largest consumer products company, based in New York.
Besides its cigarette brands, which include Marlboro and Benson &amp;
Hedges, the company sells items ranging from Miller beer to Maxwell
House coffee to Velveeta cheese spread.

<HEAD>Budget Deal Would Raise OSHA Fines for First Time in 20 Years</HEAD>

   Occupational Safety and Health Administration
fines would increase for the first time in the agency's 20-year
history under the $500 billion deficit-cutting package.
   The proposed sharp increases in federal fines for workplace
safety violations came under fire from business and labor leaders
on Tuesday.
   The AFL-CIO has been pushing higher OSHA fines for years, but
spokesman Rex Hardesty complained Tuesday that the proposed
increases were being spurred by a desire to cut the deficit rather
than an effort to protect workers' lives.
   Under the deficit-reduction package unveiled Sunday by White
House and congressional budget negotiators, OSHA fines would be
raised by five times. The most serious penalty - for willful
violations of workplace safety regulations - would increase from
$10,000 to $50,000.
   Mark Cowan, who heads a consulting firm that represents
corporations, said, ``It sounds like OSHA's about collecting money
to pay the tax man. ... It's like the former Georgia speed traps,
where they used a massive campaign to catch speeders to raise
revenues for the state.''
   Cowan, who served as a Labor Department chief of staff and OSHA
aide under then-President Reagan, said the agency would be
``regulating without public involvement,'' contending the plan
would not get a thorough hearing in Congress.
   AFL-CIO spokesman Rex Hardesty said officials ``won't raise OSHA
fines when our brothers' and sisters' lives are in jeopardy, but
they'll raise fines for a deficit.''
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole had pushed for a threefold
increase, giving the agency the power to levy fines as high as
$30,000 for the most flagrant violations, noted department
spokeswoman Johanna Schneider.
   The department supports the fivefold increase in the budget deal
because President Bush supports it, she said.
   She said OSHA inspectors still would be most concerned with
worker safety, adding, ``We're just not interested in cash or the
bottom line.''
   The higher fines would raise an estimated $95 million in the
1991 fiscal year and $1.1 billion more over the next four years,

   Shoppers in this deliriously rich
Dallas enclave look at it this way: If you can afford a $50,000
Mercedes Benz, surely, my dear, you can afford the luxury tax on
it.
   ``I don't like it, but I think it's fair,'' said Rick Jones,
sorting through designer shirts at the Polo Shop, one of this
community's high-priced shops.
   But Randle Stricklin, a salesman at Cartier Inc., where watches
range in price from $1,000 to $20,000, complained the tax burden
should fall evenly on all retailers.
   ``It hits hard,'' he said. ``Why single out luxury dealers, who
have suffered in the last 10 years - especially in Texas?''
   Elsewhere in the country, merchants who cater to the carriage
trade complain that the government proposal to raise taxes on
big-ticket items - including expensive cars, yachts, jewelry and
furs - discriminates against their wealthy clientele.
   Though they protest, many merchants are bracing for a flurry of
sales as customers rush to put an extra case of champagne or a pair
of sapphire earrings on their tab for the holidays, before the tax
takes effect.
   The 10 percent luxury tax, part of a $500 billion
deficit-reduction agreement unveiled Sunday, would apply to the
portion of the price of some luxury items over certain thresholds.
   For example, a $6,000 fur - priced $1,000 above the $5,000 tax
threshold - would cost $6,100, if the taxes are approved by
Congress. Cars would be taxed at 10 percent of the amount above
$30,000. The threshold for jewelry would be $5,000.
   ``If you can afford to pay $30,000 for a car, you sure can
afford to pay a few hundred dollars more,'' said Terri Jung of
Austin as she left a Neiman-Marcus store.
   ``My first answer as a luxury car dealer is, maybe it isn't
fair,'' said Todd Meier, president of Rodger Meier Cadillac, where
$55,000 cars are sold from a chandelier-lit showroom. ``But
overall, as a citizen, I think it makes sense to tax people who
theoretically can afford it.''
   Meier said virtually all of the more than 2,000 new Cadillacs he
sells each year would be affected by the tax.
   Highland Park, home of the billionaire Hunt brothers and tycoon
T. Boone Pickens, sits squarely in the middle of Dallas, a separate
world where nannies wheel their charges along streets lined with
Mercedes-Benzes, Cadillacs and BMWs.
   Highland Park shopper Billy McCarthy said the luxury tax was
unjust. ``It'll just be going for the wealthy,'' he said. ``We're
overtaxed as it is.''
   Most agreed the taxes might slow the economy by dissuading
middle-class shoppers but would not affect the rich.
   ``It might prevent people like us. We're going to think twice,''
said DeAnn Ralston, window-shopping with co-workers outside
Bachendorf's Jewelers.
   In any case, luxury is in the eye of the beholder.
   Roger Rock, manager of a Tiffany &amp; Co. store, said he didn't
think the taxes would slow business. Tiffany's catalog lists
jewelry ranging from under $200 to nearly $1 million.
   ``It depends on what you call luxuries,'' Rock said. ``From my
point of view, these are all necessities.''

   The backlog of patent applications for
inventions in the biotechnology field has grown to 8,213 and some
applicants are waiting almost four years for final action by the
Patent and Trademark Office, a study says.
   The General Accounting office, in a report released Tuesday,
said the inventory of unexamined biotechnology patent applications
increased by about 33 percent in 1989 and 1990 and that efforts to
accelerate the process ``have been less effective than
anticipated.''
   Waiting time for biotechnology patents, the study said, averaged
about 26 months last year, compared to a 19-month average wait in
other technology fields.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, who ordered the study by the GAO, the
investigative arm of Congress, called the finding ``very, very
disturbing.''
   ``These sorts of delays not only put struggling, young biotech
companies at risk, they may also hold up distribution of new,
lifesaving drugs, seed for supercrops or engineered organisms to
clean up pollution,'' the Oregon Democrat said.
   To obtain a patent, applicants must file descriptions of the new
technology. Patent examiners then determine if the proposal is new,
useful and significantly different from earlier patents. This
requires experts, who understand the science involved, to search
previous patent files.
   Among biotechnology patents issued in 1989, those for genetic
engineering inventions took the longest - an average of 47.4
months. Patents for immunology inventions took an average of 44.1
months and biochemicals 37.7 months.
   The GAO said the Patent Office increased its biotechnology
patent examiners from 91 to 112 from October 1988 to July 1990. It
said more examiners could not be hired because the Patent Office
lacked experienced senior staff to train the new employees.
   The report said the lack of experienced examiners in
biotechnology has caused the first examination of patent
applications to be delayed an average of 13.1 months, compared with
an average of 7.1 for all technologies.
   Patent Office officials once set a goal of reducing the
processing time for biotechnology applications to 18 months by
1992, but the report said the officials now believe they will be
unable to meet that goal.

   Wealthy Americans would bear the lightest
share of the burden imposed by the new $500 billion
deficit-reduction plan, while the poorest people would shoulder the
greatest costs, a congressional study says.
   The richest one-fifth of American families, with annual
after-tax income averaging $81,934, would lose 0.9 percent of their
earnings as a result of the plan. That would come to a $766 loss.
   But the poorest one-fifth of Americans would lose 2 percent of
their average $7,316 annual after-tax incomes, or $148, according
to the study by the House Ways and Means Committee.
   The average American family would suffer a 1.2 percent hit. Its
$33,401 average after-tax income would shrink by $394.
   The analysis seems to show that one of the priorities Democrats
touted during their four months of budget negotiations with the
Bush administration - a package that spreads the burden based on
peoples' ability to pay - was not achieved.
   The study analyzed the effects of the higher taxes and benefit
program cuts the package would impose. These include levies on
luxury items, tobacco, alcohol, fuel, airline tickets and the
incomes of people who earn more than $100,000 annually.
   The package also applies the 1.45 percent Medicare tax to people
with incomes of up to $73,000, rather than the current $51,300. It
increases the monthly $28.60 premium Medicare recipients pay for
doctors' care by about $5, and doubles the $75 deductible
beneficiaries themselves pay for physicians' bills.
   It provides a number of tax breaks for businesses and expands
the earned income tax credit for the poor.
   It also requires states to impose two-week waiting periods for
people waiting to collect unemployment benefits.
   The study also concluded that:
   -For families in the second-lowest fifth of annual income,
averaging $16,917, the loss would be 1.6 percent, or $272.
   -For families in the middle fifth, averaging $25,896, the loss
would be 1.3 percent, or $347.
   -For families in the second-highest fifth, or an average of
$36,481, the loss would be 1.1 percent, or $416.
   The study also made a pitch for the $14.5 billion expansion of
child care initiatives that the Ways and Means Committee is
pursuing.
   The analysis showed that if the child care measure is approved -
along with the extension of the 3 percent tax on telephone calls
intended to pay for it - the distribution of the budget package
would be spread more evenly.
   The poorest one-fifth of Americans would lose 0.9 percent of
their after-tax incomes, while the wealthiest one-fifth would lose
1 percent.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was mostly lower against other
major currencies in Europe late this morning. Gold prices were
higher.
   Traders said they expected quiet conditions for the rest of the
session because the German markets are closed for the unification
day celebrations.
   Traders said the dollar has settled in a narrow range between
1.5440 marks and 1.5570 marks and isn't likely to break outside
this range unless there are clear signals from the U.S. Federal
Reserve about its monetary policy.
   ``We are in a stand-by situation,'' one Milan trader said.
   Clues about the direction of U.S. interest rates might surface
later in the day when Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan testifies before
a congressional committee on the banking insurance system.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.08 yen to a closing 136.65 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted at 136.77 yen.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8905, compared
with $1.8890 late Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning in Europe, compared with late
Tuesday's rates included: 1.5515 German marks, down from 1.5540;
1.2915 Swiss francs, up from 1.2900; 5.1995 French francs, down
from 5.2050; 1.7480 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7502; 1,162.50
Italian lire, down from 1,162.75, and 1.1528 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1532.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$389.85 per ounce at midmorning, up from $388.75 bid an ounce late
Tuesday. In Zurich, the bid price was $388.80, up from $388.60.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.23 to close at a bid
$388.48.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.69 a troy ounce,
down from Tuesday's $4.72.

   Gasoline prices at the pump rose 3.6 cents last
week to an average of $1.346 per gallon of self-serve regular
unleaded, according to a nationwide survey.
   That puts gasoline 27.1 cents a gallon higher than on Aug. 1,
the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait and threw world oil markets into
chaos.
   The survey was released Tuesday by the American Automobile
Association.
   The average pump price remains below the highest ever recorded
by the AAA, which was $1.388 per gallon in 1981 after the Iranian
revolution.
   Gasoline prices were up in all regions of the country, with the
biggest increase in the Great Lakes region, the AAA survey said.

   Physicists at Princeton University say they
have developed a fusion reactor capable of producing as much energy
as it consumes, a step that brings them closer to harnessing the
energy of the H-bomb.
   Scientists said Tuesday the breakthrough allows them to move
ahead with developing fusion as an alternative to coal and nuclear
power.
   But they cautioned that the project, which has spanned 15 years
and cost $1 billion, faces several major hurdles - including
determining how to extract the energy from the reactor - and could
be decades away from commercial use.
   Scientists said their Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor at Princeton
can reach the break-even point.
   ``It's step one, the first real threshold you have to get across
to get an engineering device whose ultimate objective is to produce
much more energy than you put in,'' said Robert Sachs, a physics
professor at the University of Chicago.
   The researchers, at the Princeton Plasma Physics Research
Laboratory, have combined atoms of a heavy form of hydrogen called
deuterium to form helium and energy.
   The next step, which researchers hope to achieve in 1993, would
use a mixture of deuterium and a radioactive form of hydrogen
called tritium to generate large amounts of energy in the Tokamak
reactor.
   Dennis Manos, principal research physicist at the Princeton
labs, said that with modifications, the reactor will be capable of
generating 10 million watts of power a day.
   Manos said the Joint European TORUS laboratory in England is
working on a similar form of energy and is observing many of the
same findings as their Princeton counterparts.
   The process used at Princeton has nothing to do with the
so-called ``cold fusion'' claimed by scientists at the University
of Utah last year, Manos said. The Utah scientists said they had
produced energy from fusion at low temperature with simple
apparatus, possibly opening the way to an almost limitless supply
of cheap energy. But other scientists generally have rejected their
claims.
   Fusion, which powers the sun and the stars, creates energy by
combining, or fusing, two hydrogen atoms into a heavier helium
atom. By contrast, fission, which powers conventional nuclear
plants, releases energy by splitting atoms.
   The hydrogen bomb uses fusion to cause mass destruction.
   Proponents say fusion eliminates the danger of reactor
meltdowns, produces less radioactive waste than current nuclear
plants do, and is produced from a readily available source -
hydrogen.
   ``It is a potentially safer technology, but it has a long way to
go when you compare it with existing commercial fission
technology,'' Manos said.
   Manos described the Tokamak as a doughnut-shaped fireplace lit
by blowtorches. Deuterium is heated to the point where atoms break
into plasma, a mixture of free electrons and free nuclei.
Scientists then bombard the plasma with a high-tech blowtorch -
radio waves and high-energy particle beams.
   Tokamak has attained 50,000 watts and a world record temperature
of 400 million degrees Centigrade with the deuterium mixture, Manos
said.
   The next step, which is scheduled for 1993, is to see if a
deuterium-tritium mixture will burn in Tokamak. Manos compared it
to developing a way to ignite a wet log in a fireplace.
   After that, the trick will be to set up a controlled-fusion
reaction that will keep going without prodding by the particle
beam.
   ``You take the blowtorch away from the wet log and see if the
log still burns,'' Manos said, adding such a step is at least a
decade away.
   The Soviet Union, the United States, Japan and the European
Economic Community hope to develop a test reactor sometime after
the year 2000, he said.
   Manos and Sachs cautioned that even if a test reactor is built
researchers will still have to find a way to get at the power.
   ``How to extract the energy from the reactor in a useful way is
an engineering question no one has yet answered,'' Sachs said.

<HEAD>Murdoch Merges Australian Papers</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: All values in U.S. dollars</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International media mogul Rupert
Murdoch said Wednesday he will merge four of his Australian
newspapers into two around-the-clock productions.
   The head of News Corp. told a news conference that the morning
Melbourne Sun and afternoon Herald would become The Herald-Sun. In
Sydney, the afternoon Mirror and the morning Daily Telegraph will
operate as the Daily Telegraph Mirror. All but the Herald are
tabloids.
   ``These far-reaching changes are made as part of a commercial
decision to consolidate News Ltd.'s competitive positions in both
cities,'' he said.
   The moves come amidst a plunge in the value of News Corp.'s
stock. It was trading Wednesday at the equivalent of $5.56 a share,
$9.42 earlier this month.
   The fall has wiped out more than $1.66 billion of the company's
market capitalization and led the Australian Stock Exchange to
launch an inquiry. News Corp. told the exchange Tuesday it did not
know the reason for the decline.
   The new 24-hour editions, publishing Monday through Saturday,
are expected to start next Monday. While Murdoch said there would
be no cutbacks in editorial staff, other production areas will be
trimmed.
   He said the Sunday Sun and the Sunday Herald in Melbourne would
continue as separate publications.
   The new Sydney paper is projected to have a circulation of
480,000, compared with 600,000 for The Herald Sun.
   Murdoch said the move was one part of News Corp.'s goal to move
to high-tech color printing in Australia, which would see full
color printing on every second page.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke said he felt the mergers would be
beneficial overall. ``It will probably mean a loss of jobs for some
people, but as far as the community in general is concerned they
probably will get a better service,'' he said.
   Hawke said he did not foresee damage from a reduction in the
divergence of newspaper voices.
   ``If I look at the sort of opinions that come out of the
Telegraph and the Mirror and out of the Sun and the Herald and the
two city papers down there, I don't see an enormous divergence of
opinion,'' he said.

   Few things get Agriculture Department
officials as worked up as prospects of a demonstration in front of
their administration building.
   The building is where the secretary of agriculture has his
office, and it's convenient for tourists walking along the Mall as
they take in the museums and art galleries.
   It's also a great place for ceremonies, such as planting trees,
and for demonstrations against all sorts of injustices and
grievances.
   A bit of each was in store on Tuesday, a bright autumn day
scheduled by the Farm Animal Reform Movement, or FARM, to protest
what the group sees as the inhumane treatment of cattle, hogs,
sheep and poultry that farmers produce for consumer tables.
   On Monday, the office of Secretary Clayton Yeutter sent notices
to reporters that he would be participating in a tree-planting
ceremony on Tuesday, an hour before the scheduled demonstration by
FARM members.
   Yeutter, the notices said, would share the planting of three
trees with His Excellency, Major General Juvenal Habyarimana,
president of the Republic of Rwanda, in central Africa.
   ``Both the United States and Rwanda recognize the importance of
reforestation,'' the notice said. ``The (USDA) is the lead agency
in the National Tree Planting Initiative, with the goal of planting
one billion trees a year.''
   The notice added that President Habyarimana's reforestation
programs ``serve as models for other African nations hoping to
increase their agricultural production.''
   On Tuesday morning during a staff meeting, Yeutter's press
secretary, Kelly Shipp, was informed that the tree-planting had
been canceled.
   A bit later, another notice went to reporters, saying that
President Habyarimana ``has canceled his stay in the United States
and returned to Rawanda.''
   Habyarimana cut short his visit to deal with an invasion of his
nation by up to 10,000 Rwandan refugees living in Uganda. The
refugees returned to their homeland on Sunday and attacked several
villages, prompting U.S. Embassy officials to begin moving
Americans out of the region today.
   The troubles in Rwanda aside, Agriculture Department officials
were left with no ceremony and the question of what to do with
three unplanted dogwood trees.
   The Forest Service provided a partial answer: one tree already
was planted, so Yeutter and guest could throw a few shovels full of
dirt on it during the ceremony and picture-taking. The other two,
standing nearby, were to be taken to the National Arboretum.
   At 3 p.m., right on schedule, a handful of FARM protesters
gathered across the street from the administration building near
their exhibits, which included gory photographs of slaughtered
livestock and a wooden crate containing a dummy calf to portray
veal production.
   More demonstrators showed up with signs and banners condemning
animal cruelty on the farm. At the peak of the march, about two
dozen demonstrators traipsed back and forth for cameras and a few
reporters.
   Nearby, at least two dozen federal police officers and USDA
security people barred the way to the front doors of the
administration building.
   Sandra Behm, one of the organizers, said in an interview that it
was annual World Farm Animals Day - as proclaimed by her group -
and also the birthdate of Mohandas K. Gandhi, the late Indian
leader.
   Behm said FARM has about 13,000 members nationwide and that she
was ``surprised more of us didn't show up'' for the demonstration.
   What does she want? Legislation that would improve the
conditions of animals raised on ``factory'' farms where they are
confined and kept in conditions of ``horrible suffering'' during
their lifetimes.
   Does this mean pigs should wear boots and cows woolen bras to
protect their udders?
   ``No, I don't think they'd like that,'' she laughed. ``I don't
think that's natural.''
   But, in the end, Behm said, ``We'd like the whole world to wake
up and see that eating animals and animal products is killing us,
killing the environment.''
   Meanwhile, she said, until that happens, animals will be raised
and killed for food, but ``we should do it as humanely as
possible.''
   A short while later, five members of the protest group were
taken into custody as they tried to outrun guards and enter the
administration building. Two were released, but three were taken
away for booking as trespassers.
   There were no visible serious injuries.
   ``We'll take care of 'em,'' said Behm. ``We'll get 'em out.''
   Suddenly, it was all over. Protesters melted away and USDA
officials got over their jitters.

<HEAD>A Year After `Mini-Crash,' Markets Still Slump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On Oct. 13, 1989, Wall Street was suddenly faced
with a problem. A planned buyout of UAL Corp., the big airline
holding company, collapsed for want of financing, touching off a
``mini-crash'' in stock prices.
   Today, nearly a year later, Wall Street still has a UAL-buyout
problem - plus a long list of others that have since all but
overshadowed it.
   In the process, the acute selloff that struck the stock market
last fall has given way to a chronic case of malaise in just about
every major category of investment, including stocks, bonds and
real estate.
   Though the two ailments might look very different at first
glance, analysts have begun to diagnose them as symptoms of a
single phenomenon: The first full-blown bear market in nearly a
decade.
   ``We've moved from a time of euphoria to a period of financial
distress,'' said Hugh Johnson at the investment firm of First
Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y. ``Last year around this time is when
everything started to come unstuck.''
   As Johnson and a good many other observers see it, the big
problem then and now can be summarized in the same simple terms:
deteriorating credit conditions.
   As autumn 1989 arrived, would-be lenders were fleeing the market
for ``junk'' debt, such as the bonds and other loans used to
finance takeovers like the proposed UAL buyout. The flagship
junk-debt firm on Wall Street, Drexel Burnham Lambert, collapsed in
February 1990, and deals like the one for UAL still have not been
concluded.
   As autumn 1990 begins, the supply of money to lend is
contracting in many additional places, most notably at the big
multinational banks near the heart of the financial system.
   ``It started at the high-risk end of lending,'' Johnson said.
``Now it's much more broad-based.''
   Any talk of a year-old bear market might not seem to square with
recollections that the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
reached a record closing high of 2,999.75 less than three months
ago, on July 16.
   But broader market indexes, made up of hundreds of stocks rather
than a handful of blue chips, lagged behind in this year's trading,
and most have never equalled the peaks they reached around
September 1989. Indeed, the highs for a few stock-price yardsticks
still date back to before the Crash of 1987.
   The charts of bank stocks tell the story in most vivid terms.
For instance, Citicorp, parent of New York's biggest bank, sold for
as much as $35.50 a share last year. Lately it has been trading for
less than $15.
   ``The banking industry is the major worry,'' said Thom Brown, an
analyst at Rutherford, Brown &amp; Catherwood Inc. in Philadelphia.
   For most people, all this raises a bottom-line question: Must
trouble on Wall Street translate into equal travail on Main Street?
Does each drop in the prices of stocks or junk bonds portend a
recession of worsening proportions?
   No single, definitive answer to this question has yet emerged.
Most of the experts now are talking of a ``mild'' economic downturn
- perhaps two consecutive calendar quarters in which the nation's
gross national product, after adjustment for inflation, declines.
   Just what toll that might exact in jobs, reduced corporate
profits or lost tax revenues for federal, state and local
governments remains to be seen.
   Some analysts talk of a risk that recession, either already
under way or soon to begin, could prove a lot more severe than has
been predicted.
   Others, by contrast, argue that most of the damage can be
confined to a relatively few industries where money and credit
conditions are most pivotal - banking, investments, housing and
perhaps a few more.
   These observers argue that much of the country did not share in
the speculative credit boom of the 1980s, and thus might not feel
the full weight of its collapse in the early 1990s.
   For instance, businesses that sell significant amounts of goods
overseas could get a lift from the decline of the dollar in foreign
exchange over the past year. Energy-related businesses stand to
benefit from the same surge in oil prices that has heightened fears
of a recession since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   In addition, many analysts say, the bleaker the economic outlook
gets, the more likely interest rates are to start falling - sooner
or later cushioning the impact of the slump and, if all goes well,
helping to set the stage for a subsequent recovery.
   But hardly anybody sees such a recovery as a prospect for the
near future. Analysts at Wright Investors' Service in Bridgeport,
Conn., concluded: ``The question at issue, it seems to us, is no
longer whether the U.S. economy will sink into recession but how
deep that recession will be.''

<HEAD>AEA Reports August Traffic Up 10 Percent, But No Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Association of European Airlines
said Wednesday its 21 member carriers posted a 10 percent rise in
overall passenger traffic in August but called the growth
``profitless.''
   The rise kept pace with traffic growth over the past year, the
AEA said, adding that the Gulf crisis, higher fuel prices and other
cost increases ``have seriously eroded already thin (profit)
margins.
   ``Current growth could fairly be described as profitless,'' the
AEA said in a statement.
   AEA said fuel costs had been rising before the Gulf crisis began
and had not been offset by the relative weakness of the dollar.
   ``While depreciation in the dollar has ... softened the effect
of more expensive fuel, it has also reduced the value of the
European airlines' dollar earnings during the peak transatlantic
travel season,'' the AEA said.
   In August, AEA traffic to and from the Middle East was down, but
losses on Gulf routes were largely offset by gains in traffic to
and from Israel.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The semiconductor research consortium Sematech has
named a top Xerox Corp. executive as its president and chief
executive officer, officials announced today.
   William J. Spencer, a veteran microelectronics researcher, will
succeed Robert Noyce at Sematech's helm. Noyce died of a heart
attack this summer.
   ``I am honored to join the elite team at Sematech,'' Spencer
said in a prepared statement.
   Spencer is the former group vice president and senior technical
officer for Xerox Corp. in Stamford, Conn. He also previously
managed Xerox's worldwide research activity.
   Noyce, a pioneer in the semiconductor industry, died June 3. He
had headed the Austin-based chip manufacturing research center
since July 1988.
   Spencer, 60, will play an important role in guiding Sematech's
research. He also will serve as a key spokesman for the microchip
industry on issues such as federal funding and bolstering the
semiconductor industry and its support companies against foreign
competitors.
   Spencer joined Xerox in 1981, when he became manager of the
company's integrated circuit laboratory at its Palo Alto Research
Center. He formerly worked for the government-funded Sandia
National Laboratories in Livermore, Calif., and as a research
professor of medicine at the University of New Mexico.
   Sematech was created by 14 companies in 1988 to regain the world
lead in microchip manufacturing technology for the United States by
1993.
   The consortium employs 650 people in Austin. It has an annual
budget of $200 million, which is supported by member companies and
by matching funds from the Defense Advanced Projects Research
Agency.

<HEAD>Soybeans Surge On USSR Rumors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices surged in early trading
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade, leading the grain
markets higher amid expectations of new Soviet purchases of U.S.
agricultural products.
   Joel Karlin, a grains analyst with Chicago-based Research
Department Inc., said rumors abounded in the markets that the
United States will grant the Soviet Union most-favored trading
status within a month.
   Karlin said the Soviets also were rumored to be seeking credit
from U.S., European and Japanese lenders, partly for purchases of
foreign agricultural products.
   ``It's giving the market a boost on ideas they're probably going
to buy some meal and oil first,'' Karlin said. ``Corn and wheat are
being dragged up by the soy complex.''
   Rain-related harvest delays in the Midwest also contributed to
the buying sentiment, although warm, dry conditions were expected
to return to the region later in the week.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 3 cents to 4 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.68} a bushel; corn
was 2 cents to 2} cents higher with December at $2.27 a bushel;
oats were { cent to 1 cent higher with December at $1.24 a bushel;
soybeans were 3} cents to 10} cents higher with November at $6.17 a

   Live cattle were .03 cent lower to .13 cent higher with October
at 79.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent lower to .13

pork bellies were .88 cent to the permitted daily limit of 2 cents

<HEAD>Bush Calls for Passage of Budget Package</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Top 17 grafs new to raise Fitzwater saying not enough votes
yet, include Fitzwater, Brady remarks on possible changes; also on
general news wires.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today called on congressional
skeptics to support a $500 billion package of tax increases and
spending cuts. He said lawmakers will be ``courting disaster'' if
they do not pass it.
   Bush urged members of Congress to vote for the package and then
``blame the president'' when they talk to voters.
   Earlier, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We
don't have enough votes yet'' to pass the budget package. He said a
Senate vote will be close, but the House at this time would defeat
the plan worked out by administration and congressional
negotiators.
   Bush called the budget agreement balanced and fair, although he
acknowledged it will hit Americans in the wallet.
   ``There's nothing that is without pain,'' the president told a
group of journalists from around the country.
   However, he said, `` It is our last best chance to try to get
this federal deficit under control.''
   ``There comes a time when you have to make tough decisions, give
a little and do what is best for the country,'' Bush said.
   He said he, too, had to compromise to get the deficit-reduction
agreement. ``No one got everything he or she wanted,'' he said.
   Bush broke his ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge to get the
budget agreement.
   ``We linger along and don't get a deal, we are courting
disaster,'' he said.
   Looking to the congressional debate on the package this week, he
said, ``I call upon the Congress, both House and Senate, to cast
their vote for this plan, and to prove to the American people that
we can solve problems, that we can go out and get something done
and put this nation on the path to long-term economic growth.''
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today he supports
the deficit-reduction package, giving Bush a big boost in his
efforts to sell the compromise proposal to Congress.
   Greenspan's views were seen as crucial because supporters of the
package are looking to the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates
to offset any negative economic effects from cutting government
spending and raising taxes.
   Fitzwater and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who briefed the
visiting journalists, said Congress might make some changes in the
package, fashioned after months of wrangling by the negotiators.
   ``There will be some details that will be fleshed out,'' said
Fitzwater, but he insisted they would not be significant changes.
   If the major provisions do not remain, he said, ``you don't have
an agreement.''
   Brady discussed changes in the context of mistakes that might
have been made in the crush to finish the deal. ``I'm sure those
mistakes will be corrected,'' he said.
   Asked about the 12-cent tax increase on gasoline included in the
package, Bush said, ``I can't get enthusiastic about a tax on the
American people. We are not dealing with the best of all worlds.''
But, he added, ``we are trying to solve an enormous problem.''
   ``The tax is fair,'' he said, noting that gasoline tax in the
United States is ``still substantially below world markets.''
   While the spending cuts and tax increases will hurt different
people in different ways, Bush said, the $500 billion package is
``the medicine that a sluggish economy needs to go forward, to have
more growth.''
   He acknowledged there is hesitancy on the part of both Democrats
and Republicans who have to face the voters next month to accept a
plan that increases taxes.
   ``I have to understand the passions of people standing out there
for election,'' he said. He indicated he would not try to punish
Republicans who don't support him. ``I can't bring myself to be
recriminatory,'' he said.
   He acknowledged that ``every once in a while the going gets a
little tough. ... Nobody said it would be easy.''
   However, he insisted that even with some members of his own
party shunning the budget agreement, ``I don't feel embattled.''
   Bush in a television address to the nation Tuesday night urged
Americans to convince skittish lawmakers that backing the package
won't cost them re-election.
   Today he continued high pressure lobbying to bring House
Republicans on board. He met with 20 Republicans this morning, and
planned to contact as many later in the day.
   Bush also canceled political travel plans for Thursday and
Friday which would have taken him to New England to campaign for
several GOP candidates. He decided to stay in Washington to lobby
for a possible congressional vote on the budget package.
   Fitzwater said several lawmakers indicated today that Bush's TV
address gave them the justification they needed to back the
package.
   ``It fulfilled a part of their need which was to have an
explanation from the president to the voters,'' the spokesman said.
   ``I'm not, and I know you're not, a fan of tax increases,'' Bush
said in a nationally televised address Tuesday night.
   ``But if there have to be tax measures, they should allow the
economy to grow. They should not turn us back to higher income tax
rates, and they should be fair,'' he added, referring to the
proposed tax increases on gasoline, cigarettes, boats, liquor and
furs.
   Many lawmakers already are shunning the package because it will
hit Americans hard in the wallet, a fact that could reverberate
when voters go to the polls next month.
   The $500 billion budget accord, reached Sunday after months of
negotiation, shaves benefits to farmers and Medicare recipients and
reduces tax deductions for people who earn more than $100,000.
   A congressional study released Tuesday said the poor would be
hit hardest by the package and the rich would feel its increases
the least. The plan's increased taxes and reduced benefits would
take an average 2 percent of the earnings of one-fifth of Americans
with the lowest incomes, according to the survey by the House Ways
and Means Committee.
   Speaking for the Democratic leadership, Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell echoed the president, saying, ``This package is a
compromise. Neither side got what it wanted.''
   Democrats, he said in an equal-time TV address after Bush spoke,
joined a Republican president to get the agreement. Now, he said,
``We hope the Republican members of Congress will also set aside
partisan differences in doing what's right.''
   While it is expected to take a tough sell among many Democrats
as well as Bush's fellow Republicans who don't want to endorse tax
increases and spending cuts in an election year, some opponents
said the president had a good chance of getting the package through
Congress.
   One, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said that more than half the
House Republicans were opposed or leaning against the package but
that administration lobbying eventually would sell it.
   Support is considered stronger in the Senate, where only
one-third of the 100 members are up for re-election this year while
all 435 House seats are up for grabs.

<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund
has suspended payment of a $245 million loan to Argentina because
the government failed to achieve promised economic reforms during
the third quarter, according to a report published Wednesday.
   Argentina did not accomplish adequate cuts in its inflation
rate, which was in double digits each month from Juyy to September,
and the government's fiscal surplus for the period turned out to be
lower than promised, according to a daily financial newspaper, El
Cronista Comercial.
   Citing sources in Washington, the newspaper reported that
Argentina can reclaim the IMF standby loan if it cuts its
government deficit, its inflation rate and the size of the public
sector work force. That would require massive layoffs, the paper
reported.

<HEAD>Maxwell To Shed TV Interests To Concentrate On Papers, Printing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Maxwell's Mirror Group Newspapers said it
will sell its interests in television companies for $300 million in
an effort to concentrate on its newspaper and printing activities.
   Maxwell said in a statement Tuesday that the decision follows
investment in new technology, which has resulted in the successful
change from black-and-white printing to color printing for three of
the group's British newspapers. They include the Daily Mirror, the
group's national-circulation tabloid flagship, which has a daily
sale of 3.9 million.
   ``We have decided in the future the group should concentrate
purely on newspapers and printing,'' the statement said. ``We
intend to expand our newspaper activities both at home and abroad,
particularly in the USA where there are some excellent
opportunities for expansion.''
   It gave no other details.
   Included in the sale of Maxwell's television holdings are a 20
percent interest in Central TV in Britain, a 12.5 percent interest
in the TV1 channel in France and a 51 percent interest in Music TV.
The company also will dispose of its interests in British Cable TV.
   Czechoslovak-born Maxwell, who has business interests in eastern
Europe, also announced the group had taken advantage of new
opportunities there with the conclusion of various transactions.
   Among them:
   - The acquisition of a 50 percent stake in the Berliner Verlag,
a newspaper and magazine publisher in what was formerly East
Germany that publishes the Berliner Zeitung newspaper and its
evening stablemate BZ am Abend. The statement said Mirror Group
Newspapers had acquired the Berliner Verlag jointly with Gruner and
Jahr, a Bertlesmann subsidiary.
   - A 40 percent interest in a daily and evening newspaper in
Budapest.
   - Participation in two newspapers in the Soviet Union - Delovoy
Mir and Literaturnya Gazeta.
   - A 40 percent interest in a Bulgarian newspaper and printing
group.

<HEAD>Future of Disgraced Junk Bond Prince Milken Rests With Young Judge</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto NY301 of Oct. 3</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>

   She speaks softly, neutralizes adversarial
lawyers with grace and charm, and often wears a ribbon in her
flowing dark hair.
   The sweet gentility and stunning good looks of U.S. District
Judge Kimba M. Wood may belie the stiff discipline of her federal
courtroom, but acquaintances know better.
   Wood is strict, shrewd and exacting.
   She is about to make history as the judge to pronounce sentence
on Michael R. Milken, the billionaire junk-bond pioneer described
by prosecutors as Wall Street's most devious crok.
   ``She's a brilliant judge, careful, patient, considerate,
concerned about reaching the right decision,'' said Jeffrey
Mishkin, chairman of the New York City bar association's federal
courts committee, who has known Wood for years.
   But Wood's sentencing record, largely for minor drug offenses,
reveals nothing about how she may punish Milken, whose case may set
a standard for the future treatment of white-collar criminals.
   At 46, she is the youngest member of the 21-judge Manhattan
federal court, one of most active in the nation, where celebrity
defendants ranging from Imelda Marcos to John Mitchell have stood
trial. She was appointed two years ago and received Milken's case
by random assignment.
   The ex-Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. executive faces up to 28
years in prison for admitting to six felonies in a plea bargain
last April, most stemming from his relationship to inside trader
and government informant Ivan F. Boesky.
   Speculation over how Wood will decide Milken's fate has become a
hot topic, especially since she took the extraordinary step of
delaying a scheduled Oct. 1 sentencing to allow for a hearing into
other crimes Milken may have committed.
   She ordered the hearing, which begins next Tuesday, after
digesting mounds of documents from the prosecution and defense,
along with hundreds of letters, painting widely divergent pictures
of Milken.
   The prosecution's pre-sentencing memorandum alleged a range of
crimes well beyond those the financier admitted. The defense called
his crimes aberrations in an otherwise upstanding life.
   Wood opted for the hearing to get a better understanding of the
real Milken.
   ``From all I can see about how she's handling the case, she's
doing it very well,'' said Harry First, a New York University law
professor familiar with Wood's background.
   ``She's not going to give in wildly one way or the other on the
pressure,'' First said. ``I doubt she'll see him as this wonderful
man who's been railroaded by the government, nor someone who made
so much money that he should go to jail for a long time.''
   Still, it's conceivable she will spare Milken from prison, as
his lawyers have urged, and put the financial wizard's talents to
work in a community service program. She can't give him any more
than the maximum 28 years.
   The few nationally significant cases Wood has handled don't
provide a full picture of her overall views but suggest she's
willing to buck conventional thinking.
   In October 1988, for example, she reversed a ruling by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service that had denied refugee
status to a Ghanian soldier who helped plan an botched coup
attempt. Wood said in some circumstances, ``a coup may be the only
means by which political change can be effected.''
   In another instance last year, she upheld the right of a
76-year-old New York state judge to seek reappointment although he
had passed retirement age.
   ``She knew the answers to every argument that was made,
indicating she had done a great deal of preparation,'' said the
state judge, Isaac Rubin. ``She's capable of handling any matter no
matter how difficult it is.''
   If there's been any flaw in Wood's handling of the Milken case
so far, experts say, it was her decision to accept his plea
agreement in the first place. Its ambiguity played an important
role in the delay of Milken's sentence as lawyers haggled over the
relevancy of unproven crimes.
   ``It looks terrible for the defendant to plead guilty to so much
less than what the government says he did,'' said Albert Alschuler,
a University of Chicago law professor who studies plea bargains.
``This flap about whether the government can talk about these other
crimes should have been settled at the time of the plea
agreement.''
   Wood declined through her clerk to be interviewed to avoid even
the appearance of prejudice or conflict of interest in the Milken
case. His defense attorneys and prosecutors also declined to
discuss the judge for the same reason.
   Nonetheless, public information and interviews with others,
including her husband, reveal a portrait of a widely admired
jurist, working mother, fluent French speaker, registered Democrat,
avid cook, tennis buff and ballet aficionado.
   ``She's always had this very calm exterior and yet she's very
tough,'' said husband Michael Kramer, a Time magazine journalist
who first met Wood in 1981. ``I mean in the judicial sense, in a
steel-trap mind way.''
   Like other working parents, she struggles to balance time for
her 4-year-old son and the rigors of the judgeship, which often
means she gets home at 9 p.m. and works weekends. Still, friends
say, she has never been intimidated in what historically has been a
male-dominated profession.
   ``I view her as a great role model for women lawyers because she
has a style that asserts itself in a totally elegant way,'' said
Laura Handman, a friend and lawyer at the New York firm of Lankenau
&amp; Bickford. ``She's completely in control, but not at all in an
aggressive, obnoxious way.''
   Kimba Maureen Wood was born Jan. 2, 1944, in Port Townsend,
Wash. Her parents found the name by leafing through an atlas and
settling on Kimba, a small town on South Australia's Eyre
Peninsula.
   Wood's resume reads like a classic example of superlatives. She
attended the Sorbonne in Paris, got her B.A. from Connecticut
College, master's degree from the London School of Economics and
law degree from Harvard University.
   She specialized in antitrust law and spent more than 15 years at
the New York law firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby &amp; MacRae, where she
represented clients ranging from Lloyds of London to St. Regis
Paper Co. and eventually earned more than $200,000 a year.
   ``She was excellent to work with, much appreciated by clients
because she was quick to understand their problems,'' said Taylor
Briggs, a senior partner who was on the committee that hired Wood.
``She was the right combination of a good person and good lawyer,
softspoken but firm.''
   Her success prompted other judges to privately encourage her to
seek a seat on the bench, although it meant a 50 percent pay cut.
She was appointed by then-President Reagan in April 1988, on the
recommendation of Republican Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato.
   ``She presented us with a final decision on it,'' Briggs said.
``That was typical of her. She decides what she wants to do and
does it.''
   Although physical appearance has nothing to do with her work,
many say Wood's dark brown, gray-flecked hair, jade-green eyes and
high cheekbones are an integral part of the impression she leaves.
   ``She's a Girl Scout. Reverent, brave, honest, loyal, friendly,
helpful,'' said Lloyd Constantine, a friend, former adversary and
chief of antitrust enforcement for New York State.
   Constantine said he believed Wood's approach in the Milken
affair was typical of how she handled cases as a lawyer.
   ``She probably wishes she could do this in isolation, outside
the microscope,'' he said. ``Knowing that's impossible, she is
absolutely preparing herself to the teeth about this. Her hallmark
was being overprepared, coming into every discussion completely,
fully informed.''

<HEAD>Looking Back on Takeovers, One Year After The Campeau Disaster</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Junk Bonds, Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a stunning disclosure from Campeau Corp.
a year ago: The real estate developer who pulled off the biggest
retail takeovers of the 1980s couldn't meet interest payments on
billions of dollars in junk bonds used to finance the deals.
   No one knew at the time, but the heavy debt load from its
purchases of Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores
Inc. would set off a chain reaction that rippled through corporate
America.
   The junk bond market collapsed on the news, bringing the '80s
takeover boom to a sudden halt as financing for deals vanished.
   It didn't end there. A month after Campeau's announcement, an
attempt by United Airlines employees to buy parent company UAL
Corp. unraveled when bankers, fearful of another disaster, refused
to back the deal.
   The failure of the UAL buyout led in turn to a 190-point drop in
the Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 13. The turbulence in the
junk bond market ultimately contributed to the bankruptcy of Drexel
Burnham Lambert, the investment firm that pioneered the risky,
high-yield securities as a tool for financing buyouts.
   The Federated and Allied deals were not the only debt-financed
transactions to falter: So did the $4.9 billion leveraged buyout of
Southland Corp. and Doskocil Inc.'s $133 million takeover of Wilson
Foods Corp.
   But a year later, corporate finance is not in chaos. Last year's
turmoil brought about a more conservative attitude toward buying
and selling companies.
   The emphasis now is on buyouts undertaken not for investment but
for strategic reasons, such as expanding a company's business and
market share.
   Economists and analysts can look back over the past year and at
the buyout binge itself and find that despite some pockets of
trouble, takeovers accomplished a lot of good.
   ``It would be naive to say they didn't do damage . . .,'' said
Professor Alfred Rappaport, a mergers and acquisitions specialist
at Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management.
``But when you look at it holistically . . . there were
considerably greater benefits than costs.''
   Others agree. ``You've still got a very small number of highly
leveraged actions that hit rough waters . . .,'' said Gregg
Jarrell, a finance professor at the University of Rochester's
William E. Simon School of Business. ``It's an exaggeration to look
back and say `My goodness, what a terrible idea.' It's inconsistent
with the evidence.''
   During the takeover boom, critics complained about assets being
sold to finance buyouts, but analysts say these divisions and
subsidiaries often landed in good hands, those of entrepreneurs or
companies seeking strategic acquisitions.
   ``Something like 80 percent of the assets acquired in leveraged
deals end up being sold to strategic buyers,'' said Jarrell.
   Takeovers also turned some firms around. ``You needed some way
to change management or change direction in a company that's not
doing so well and in many cases we got that,'' said Bernard Black,
a corporate finance professor at Columbia University's School of
Law.
   Black cited Revlon Inc. as an example of a company that
benefited from a buyout.
   Takeover strategist Ronald Perelman won control of Revlon in
1985 and pared down all its businesses except for cosmetics.
   ``He sells off health care to people who run health care and
probably run it better,'' Black said. ``He keeps the cosmetics
business and buys more, building up the Revlon name.''
   Sometimes just the threat of a buyout kept managers on their
toes.
   After GAF Corp. dropped a takeover attempt of Union Carbide
Corp. in 1986, Carbide recapitalized, sold businesses including
Eveready batteries and Glad plastic bags and focused on chemicals.
It became a better company and its stock price rose, Black said.
   Without the takeover boom, ``We wouldn't have made the progress
in getting ahead into productivity in the way that we've begun to
do,'' said Rappaport. ``That was an important prod to management.''
   But does this mean that executives, now facing less of a threat
from outsiders, will let their companies become flabby?
   No, because takeovers helped create a force that isn't going
away: institutional investors who are becoming increasingly active
and forcing management to be more responsive to shareholders.
   ``They've had to step up to the plate now that Boone Pickens and
Carl Icahn and those folks have been hobbled,'' Jarrell said.
   The institutions, many of them big public employee pension
funds, were already gaining notoriety in the early '80s, but they
are ``more aggressive than they would have been had it not been for
the takeovers,'' said Jarrell.
   Institutions found that the large blocs of shareholder votes
they controlled gave them power even beyond takeover battles and
proxy fights where dissidents sought to unseat directors.
   Despite such achievements, analysts don't ignore the reality
that debt-financed takeovers damaged or destroyed some companies
and curtailed the profits and expansion ability of others.
   The problem was money was so easy to borrow that no one worried
about exorbitant prices and insurmountable debt.
   ``People lost sight of how to value a company,'' Rappaport said.
``The sin was not leverage - the sin was paying too much and
utilizing leverage in companies and times where it wasn't
warranted.''
   Black agreed, saying, ``The prices just got to points where
everything had to go right for anyone to make any money.''
   That was the exact problem in the buyouts of Federated and
Allied, which cost Campeau $10 billion.
   Today, the two retailers are mired in the Chapter 11
reorganization process. So is Ames Department Stores Inc., which
foundered after acquiring the Zayre discount store chain.
   Other companies went out of business after buyouts: most of the
B. Altman and Bonwit Teller stores owned by L. J. Hooker Corp. and
the Garfinckel's and Miller &amp; Rhoads store chains.
   Southland is walking a tightrope, trying to complete a planned
bailout by a Japanese retailer but also considering a Chapter 11
filing.
   These companies have a common thread: They are retailers. But
that's no coincidence - many buyouts that stumbled were in cyclical
industries, subject to the uncertainties of consumer spending or
seasonal factors.
   But even a food company like Doskocil was not immune from debt
problems, and it is also reorganizing in bankruptcy court.
   There's one silver lining amid the misfortunes of overburdened
companies - new opportunities for other businessmen.
   Companies and funds have been formed to rescue firms. GE Capital
Corporate Finance Group, for example, has established a specialty
operation providing debt and equity for restructurings,
reorganizations and turnarounds.
   Although the end of the takeover boom forced many Wall Street
firms to trim their investment banking staffs, today's strategic
transactions prompted some dealmakers to leave the big firms and
set up their own companies.

   The stock market declined slightly today in a
quiet, drifting session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.68 to 2,497.52
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 632 up, 833 down and
467 unchanged.
   Stock prices began to rally late last week from their lowest
levels in more than a year.
   The upswing has drawn support from a drop in oil prices and some
muted enthusiasm over the budget compromise reached by President
Bush and many members of Congress.
   But analysts said traders remained cautious about chances for
any major progress in shrinking the federal deficit, especially
given the recession fears that have swept the financial world of
late.
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, offered a bit
of reassurance on that score today, saying the budget plan held out
the prospect of ``what appears to be a credible, enforcable
reduction in the budget deficit.''
   Among the blue chips, Boeing rose &lsqb; to 43&rsqb;; International
Business Machines dropped { to 107}; General Electric lost 1 to

   Apple Computer dropped 2&lsqb; to 27{ in the over-the-counter market.

<HEAD>Soybeans Surge On Soviet Buying Talk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose sharply Wednesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, leading grain futures higher amid
unconfirmed rumors that the Soviet Union has been on an
international agricultural buying binge.
   Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain
trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., cited reports and
rumors that Moscow bought as much as 900,000 metric tons of soybean
meal from U.S., South American and European suppliers and 5 million
tons of grain from Canada.
   The Soviets also were said to have bought as much as 8 million
metric tons of various agricultural commodities from all over the
world since Tuesday, Lespinasse said.
   ``We don't know if it's true,'' he said. ``We certainly think
it's true in the case of the meal.''
   Soybean meal for October delivery rocketed up more than $8 a
ton, which gave the soybean market its strongest boost. All grain
and soybean markets closed below the day's highs, though, as
profit-taking cut the gains near the close.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 3 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.74 a bushel; corn was
2{ cents to 4 cents higher with December at $2.29\ a bushel; oats
were { cent to 1{ cents higher with December at $1.23} a bushel;
soybeans were 4 cents to 14\ cents higher with November at $6.20{ a

<HEAD>EC Wants Special Trade Arrangements with East</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community on Wednesday asked for
special exemptions from world trade rules while the Eastern part of
Germany is integrated into the 12-nation trading bloc.
   A senior EC official told the council of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade that the EC wants permission to make its own
arrangements with trading partners of former East Germany.
   The official, Tran Van Thinh, said although bilateral deals with
East Berlin violated GATT's international rules, the EC could not
ignore the legitimate interests of Eastern European countries.
   GATT's ``most favored nation'' principle stipulates that a
government should not give trading benefits to one country without
extending them to other members of the trade forum. East Germany
was not a member of the 99-nation GATT.
   East Germany's external trade was $59 billion in 1988.
Two-thirds was in bilateral deals with the Soviet Union and other
countries in COMECON, the East European trading group.
   A statement from the EC said an abrupt halt to this trade would
``lead to a number of additional factory closures, further loss of
production and higher unemployment'' in the countries affected.
   The EC said transitional arrangements would be limited both in
duration and scope. Countries affected would include the Soviet
Union, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and
Yugoslavia.
   Trade officials said the GATT council would discuss the request
at its meeting in November.

   Sales of the Big Three automakers' North
American-made cars and trucks dropped 8.9 percent in late September
and 10 percent for the 1990 model year, which ended with ominous
tones from the Mideast and Capitol Hill, automakers said Wednesday.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
their vehicle sales fell to an average daily rate of 38,648 during
the Sept. 21-30 period this year, compared with a rate of 42,408
during the same time last year.
   Car sales fell 5.1 percent and truck sales were off 15.1
percent.
   Each of the automakers said it still hasn't seen any dip in
sales volumes or move to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars tied
directly to rising oil prices in the wake of Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   But Ford sales Vice President Robert Rewey said the decline was
spurred by sagging consumer confidence.
   ``Accordingly, now that the deficit reduction agreement has been
reached, we hope that interest rates will be reduced,'' Rewey said,
referring to Sunday's proposal on new taxes and spending cuts to
shrink the deficit.
   Among the new taxes is a three-step proposal to boost the
federal gasoline tax to 21 cents a gallon after next July 1 from
the current 9 cents a gallon. Congress still must enact legislation
for such charges to be implemented.
   Such a tax increase, coupled with rising gasoline prices because
of the Mideast crisis, may push consumers into smaller cars,
analysts have speculated.
   For the 1990 model year, which ran from Oct. 1, 1989, through
Sept. 30, the Big Three's domestic car and truck sales dropped to
an average daily rate of 31,496 compared with 35,002 the year
before.
   Car sales fell 13 percent and truck sales dropped 5.4 percent.
   In late-September last year, automakers were winding up
end-of-model-year fire sales that included attractive cash rebates
and low-interest financing deals.
   When the 1990 model year began last October, the companies
pulled back on their incentives and their sales rates plummeted.
   Through the first nine months of the calendar year, the Big
Three said their vehicle sales were down 8.2 percent as car sales
fell 10.6 percent and truck sales declined 4.2 percent.
   Ford said its late-September domestic car sales rose 3.5 percent
but truck sales fell 3 percent for a combined 1.1 percent increase
in vehicle sales. So far this year, Ford's combined car and truck
sales were 8.6 percent behind last year's pace.
   Ford's model-year sales of domestic cars and trucks were down 10
percent from the 1989 model year.
   GM said its car and truck sales for late September were 16.1
percent behind last year, with car sales down 12.2 percent and
truck sales off a hefty 23.3 percent. Through the first nine months
of this year, GM's vehicle sales were down 5.4 percent.
   For the 1990 model year, sales of GM's domestically assembled
vehicles were off 8.8 percent.
   Chrysler has been in a sales slump since February, when
incentives expired on the company's popular minivans. It said its
late-September truck sales, which include minivans, fell 14.3
percent compared with the year-ago period and car sales were up 5.5
percent combining for a 4.7 percent decline in vehicle sales for
the period.
   Through the first nine months of 1990, Chrysler's combined car
and truck sales were down 14.6 percent and for the 1990 model year,
the sales rate was off 13.4 percent.

<TEXT>
   William J. Spencer, a microelectronics
researcher and Xerox Corp. vice president, Wednesday was chosen
president and chief executive of the Sematech semiconductor
research consortium.
   Spencer, 60, succeeds Robert Noyce, who died of a heart attack
June 3.
   Noyce, co-inventor of the integrated circuit and a pioneer in
the semiconductor industry, had headed the Austin-based chip
manufacturing research center since 1988.
   Spencer will play an important role in guiding Sematech's
research. He also will serve as a key spokesman for the microchip
industry on issues such as federal funding and bolstering the
semiconductor industry.
   ``The national mission we must accomplish is key to America's
competitiveness and key to preserving our standard of living for
our children and our grandchildren,'' Spencer told Sematech's
Austin workforce after his appointment Wednesday.
   ``I am honored to join the elite team at Sematech,'' he said.
   The nonprofit Sematech was created by 14 companies in 1988 to
regain the world lead in microchip manufacturing technology for the
United States by 1993.
   The consortium employs 650 people in Austin. It has an annual
budget of $200 million, which is supported by member companies and
matching funds from the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency.
   Spencer brings to his new post a lengthy background in
microelectronics research.
   He was group vice president and senior technical officer for
Xerox Corp. in Stamford, Conn. He also managed Xerox's worldwide
research activity.
   Spencer joined Xerox in 1981 as manager of the company's
integrated circuit laboratory at its Palo Alto Research Center. He
formerly worked for the government-funded Sandia National
Laboratories in Livermore, Calif., and Albuquerque, N.M., and was a
research professor of medicine at the University of New Mexico.
   Holder of a master's degree in mathematics and a doctorate in
physics from Kansas State University, Spencer began his career in
1959 with Bell Laboratories.
   ``Sematech and the semiconductor industry are extremely
fortunate to have Bill Spencer as a champion and leader,'' said
Charles Sporck, chairman of Sematech's board of directors and head
of the selection team which chose him.
   ``With his experience in key research positions at Bell
Laboratories, Sandia National Laboratories and Xerox Corp., Dr.
Spencer has the technical expertise to implement programs which
will enable this country to remain globally competitive,'' Sporck
said.
   Sematech is developing advanced semiconductor manufacturing
methods, equipment and materials. Research results are given to the
member companies and the federal government for commercial and
military applications.
   As CEO, Spencer will direct Sematech's advance semiconductor
manufacturing staff and will serve as the consortium's primary
liaison to its 14 member companies and the government.
   Member companies include Advanced Micro Devices, AT&amp;T, DEC,
Harris Corp., Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, LSI Logic, Micron
Technology, Motorola, NCR, National Semiconductor, Rockwell
International and Texas Instruments.

<HEAD>Junk Market Down, But Not Out Forever, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year since Campeau Corp. found itself buried
in takeover debt, the buyout business has regained much of its
vigor, but the junk bond market that fueled the 1980s merger boom
still lies battered and bruised.
   Analysts say the bonds will make a comeback someday because they
were too good an idea to give up.
   ``It's a legitimate financial tool and too many people made too
much money for something like that to be forgotten,'' said Gregg
Jarrell, a finance professor at the University of Rochester's
William E. Simon School of Business.
   Alfred Rappaport, a professor at Northwestern University's
Kellogg Graduate School of Management, agreed: ``Obviously there's
some stigma attached to it, but the broad idea of making capital
available at less than investment grade to companies is as
appealing now as in the '80s.''
   Campeau's $6.6 billion buyout of Federated Department Stores
Inc. and its earlier $3.6 billion takeover of Allied Stores Corp.
depended heavily on junk bonds. The company's announcement that it
could not meet interest payments on the high-yield securities
shocked the $200 billion junk bond market, sending prices sharply
lower.
   But that was just the first in a series of hits. The next one
came in October after a planned employee buyout of UAL Corp.
faltered. Bond prices were slammed again in January as Federated
and Allied filed for bankruptcy protection.
   January brought another cruel blow: lower-than-expected ratings
for bonds issued by RJR Nabisco Inc. The company's outstanding junk
bonds - once a rock of stability amid the market's turmoil - fell
10 percent in value in one day, and took other junk issues down
with them.
   This past summer brought a recovery of sorts to the market,
prompted in part by RJR Nabisco's plans to recapitalize and retire
some junk debt. The financial press began to talk about a comeback.
   But in August Iraq invaded Kuwait, triggering concerns about a
weakening economy. The junk market fell to new lows as it suffered
along with other bonds, stocks and the dollar.
   Investors lost billions of dollars as the junk bond market
collapsed. Some of them were savings and loans associations that
became insolvent and were forced to seek government assistance.
   Perhaps the biggest casualty of the junk bond troubles was
Drexel Burnham Lambert, the investment firm that pioneered their
use as a buyout tool. Drexel was forced to seek Chapter 11
bankruptcy court protection because of its own junk bond losses.
   With a track record like that, it's hard to imagine junk bonds
could make a comeback.
   But they were popular investments, not only because they helped
some people make a lot of money. They also helped companies that
couldn't get credit any other way. And they helped young companies
like MCI Communications Corp. expand.
   ``It is central to the growth of key industries and companies,''
said Rappaport of the junk market.
   Furthermore, ``people in the financial markets have very short
memories,'' he said.
   But just when the market will come back is hard to say,
especially with the economy's current malaise and with debt
increasingly becoming a four-letter word.
   ``At a time when the economy is slowing, you're better off
slowing an accumulation of corporate debt,'' said Alan Levinson,
director of financial services with Wefa Group, an economic
forecasting service in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   Furthermore, companies feel it's safer to secure bank loans at
several points above the current 10 percent prime rate than to sell
bonds carrying interest rates of 16 percent or 17 percent.
   Even when the market does revitalize, no one expects junk debt
to be issued at the pace of the 1980s.

<HEAD>Dollar Moves Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar declined on world currency markets
Wednesday amid expectations that interest rates are poised to move
lower.
   Gold prices bounced higher in a technical rally. On New York's
Commodity Exchange, bullion settled at $393.90, up $4.80 a troy
ounce. Later, Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of
$394.00 an ounce, up $5.
   The dollar slumped following Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's endorsement of the proposed budget agreement. He told
Congress that the $500 billion deficit-reduction package would
``lessen pressures in credit markets.'' Though he did not
specifically promise to lower interest rates, Greenspan said he
``most certainly'' believed an enacted budget agreement would exert
downward pressure on rates.
   Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less
attractive, thereby reducing investors' need for the U.S. currency.
   Greenspan's comments ``drove the dollar down . . . to new lows
for the week,'' said Marc Chandler, an analyst at the consulting
firm IDEA. Still, Chandler noted that the dollar did not pierce
``the bottom of a broad trading range.''
   Trading was relatively light, which exacerbated the dollar's
move downward.
   Chandler predicted traders will continue to sell dollars ahead
of Friday's release of unemployment data for September.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar eased to 136.65 Japanese yen, from
Tuesday's 136.73 yen. Later in London, the dollar fell to 135.15
yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 136.04, down from 136.72 yen
on Tuesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8990, more expensive for
buyers than Tuesday's late $1.8890. In New York, it cost $1.9025 to
buy one pound, more expensive for buyers than $1.8930 on Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates included: 1.5420 German marks, down from 1.5495;
1.2835 Swiss francs, down from 1.2885; 5.1660 French francs, down
from 5.1915; 1,155.75 Italian lire, down from 1,160.75, and 1.1516
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1527.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates included: 1.5435 German marks, down from 1.5540; 1.2845 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2900; 5.1747 French francs, down from 5.2050;
1.7410 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7502; 1,160.25 Italian lire,
down from 1,162.75, and 1.1516 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1532.
   Gold prices moved higher overseas. In London, the metal closed
at a bid $390.75 a troy ounce, up from $388.75 late Tuesday, and at
$390.50 bid in Zurich, up from $388.60. Earlier in Hong Kong gold
closed at $389.15 bid, up from $387.55.
   Silver prices were mixed On New York' Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $4.690 a troy ounce, up from $4.679 on
Tuesday. But in London the metal closed at $4.70 an ounce, down
from $4.725.

   The stock market retreated near the close of a
quiet session Wednesday, faced with revived upward pressure on oil
prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which spent much of the
session hovering near Tuesday's closing level, finished with a
15.84-point loss at 2,489.36.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
564 up, 972 down and 437 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 135.49 million
shares, against 188.32 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 165.41 million shares.
   Stock prices began to rally late last week from their lowest
levels in more than a year.
   The upswing drew support from an encouraged reaction to the
budget compromise reached by President Bush and many members of
Congress.
   But analysts said traders remained cautious about chances for
any major progress in shrinking the federal deficit, especially
given the recession fears that have swept the financial world of
late.
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, offered a bit
of reassurance on that score Wednesday, saying the budget plan held
out the prospect of ``what appears to be a credible, enforcable
reduction in the budget deficit.''
   The recent recovery in stocks also drew some impetus from a drop
in oil prices. But the oil market turned upward again Wednesday,
sending crude oil futures for November delivery more than $3 a
barrel higher to more than $37 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included International
Business Machines, down ~ at 107&rsqb;; General Electric, down 1\ at
54{; Eastman Kodak, down } at 37\, and General Motors, down 1| at
35&rsqb;.
   GM posted a 16.1 percent decline in domestic sales of cars and
light trucks for late September.
   Retailing stocks were broadly lower, weighed down by
increasingly gloomy expectations for holiday-season spending by
consumers. Wal-Mart Stores fell 1} to 27}; Sears Roebuck 1&lsqb; to 25&rsqb;;
J.C. Penney 1{ to 42}; K mart ~ to 25{, and The Limited 1\ to 13.
   Apple Computer dropped 2| to 27 in the over-the-counter market.
The company announced plans for lower-than-expected prices on three
personal computers it is introducing this month.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $30.34 billion, or 1.02
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.79 to 170.80.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 3.68 to 367.37, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 3.81 at 311.40.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
tumbled 4.94 to 351.45. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 309.25, down .38.

<BYLINE>By PETER VILES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colt's Manufacturing Co. announced
Wednesday the resignation of its president and chief executive,
Richard F. Gamble, who helped arrange a state-backed buyout in
March that ended a three-year strike at the gun maker.
   The company said Ronald E. Stilwell, an 18-year veteran of
Colt's who also participated in the management-led buyout, will
become the new president.
   Colt's, which makes the military's M-16 rifle, did not
immediately name a new CEO, but company Chairman Anthony D.
Autorino said Stilwell would be a candidate for that job as well.
   In March, Gamble, Autorino and Colt Firearms executives joined
with striking workers and the state to buy the gun maker from its
parent, Colt Industries. The buyout, which drew some criticism
because it brought the state into the gun making business, ended a
bitter, three-year strike at the company.
   Last week, a state financial report indicated the market value
of the state's $25 million investment of pension funds in Colt's
decreased by about 13 percent in the cmmpany's first three months.
   But officials said Wednesday the company is in good financial
health, thanks largely to Gamble's efforts during six months as
president and CEO.
   ``The state's investment in Colt's remains a fiscally prudent
one,'' state Treasurer Francisco L. Borges said in a prepared
statement.
   Autorino said Gamble had planned to return to retirement after
leading the new company through its first six months.
   Both Autorino and Kathleen Palm, an aide to Borges, said Colt's
has improved financially since June 30.
   Colt's makes handguns and rifles for sporting, law enforcement
and military use. Its products include the Colt 45 pistol, the
Sporter rifle and the M-16. ``We expect to see our military
business grow in the near future,'' Autorino said. ``With the
Mideast situation, there's a lot of things happening with the
M-16.''

<HEAD>American Express Trying to Recoup Charges from Tour by Unemployed
Mom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Express is trying to recoup over
$24,000 in charges from an unemployed woman who declared personal
bankruptcy shortly after a two-month European tour with multiple
cards.
   ``You gave this woman seven cards? That's appalling,'' Chief
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Alexander Paskay told Ira Axelrod, an
American Express representative during a hearing Tuesday.
   Last October, Dixie Lee Dorsey went on an eight-country European
tour and charged $24,227 on two of her seven American Express cards
although she had little income and has been without a job since
1978.
   ``You were just charging whatever you felt like charging?''
Larry Foyle, an attorney for American Express, asked Ms. Dorsey.
   ``I was having a good time,'' Ms. Dorsey replied.
   The 37-year-old Winter Haven woman declared personal bankruptcy
in January, shortly after she and her two daughters returned from
the trip.
   American Express Travel Related Services is trying to recover
the money she charged. The company maintained she obtained the
Green and Gold cards under pretexts and charged luxury goods and
services even though she knew she couldn't pay for them.
   Dorsey's number of accounts was unusual, Axelrod said, but not
unique. He said card holders can charge as long as their payment
history is good and Ms. Dorsey was current on all seven accounts
until she went to Europe.
   On her bankruptcy petition, she listed total debts of $193,577.
   Paskay didn't rule immediately, but said he would issue an order
on whether she should be held responsible for the American Express
charges even though she is in bankruptcy proceedings.
   Ms. Dorsey, who appeared without a lawyer, said she once had as
many as 25 credit cards.
   Even though she quit her last job 12 years ago, she said she was
able to meet her obligations until her boyfriend disappeared late
last year with much of her property. She said he had been giving
her between $3,200 and $6,000 a month.

<HEAD>Dispute On Heating Oil Tax Percolates on Hill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians from the Northeast are fighting a
proposed 2-cent per gallon tax on home heating oil, as ranking
officials disagree on whether the proposal could scuttle the budget
agreement.
   The regional dispute drew a call to Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen
from his 1988 presidential running mate, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis, the governor said Wednesday.
   Bentsen, who ran for vice president alongside Dukakis, said that
if taxes are raised on other petroleum products, heating oil should
be no exception.
   ``His goal was to ensure an equitable sharing of the tax
burden,'' spokesman Jack DeVore said.
   Bentsen argues that the gasoline tax is more burdensome to
residents of southwestern states who drive farther, on average,
than northeasterners.
   But northeasterners are particularly concerned about heating oil
because a cold snap last December caused prices to skyrocket and
the Middle East crisis is pushing prices up going into this year's
heating season.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said he is among those working
to eliminate the heating oil tax from a budget agreement hammered
out by congressional leaders and administration officials.
   On the House floor, Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., warned Wednesday
that the heating oil tax could lead to a mass defection by
northeastern lawmakers from a budget agreement. The budget
compromise had originally exempted heating oil from any new tax,
but it was changed at the last minute.
   ``Mr. Speaker, I hope you and the majority leader in the other
body (Senate) help me restore the home heating oil exemption,''
Conte said. ``Because without it, support for the budget package
among the Northeast and this member is shaky.''
   Conte's threatened defection is notable because, as ranking
Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, he was among the
participants in the closed-door negotiations that led to the budget
agreement between the Bush administration and congressional
leaders.
   Rep. Barbara Kennelly, D-Conn., joined in the anti-heating oil
tax effort by writing to Bentsen: ``I cannot accept the two-cent
tax on heating oil. This is a longtime traditional disagreement
between our regions, but I refuse to concede.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, in a Washington news
conference, acknowledged that the heating oil tax is politically
sensitive but rejected the suggestion that the issue alone could
sink an agreement on reducing the federal deficit by $40 billion.
   The heating oil tax raised concern and anger among northeastern
officials as much for how it happened as for the substance of the
proposal.
   According to Conte, the summit agreement made final on Sunday
contained a specific exemption protecting home heating oil from a
general 2-cent-per-gallon tax on other petroleum products. But
later, even as congressional leaders were gathering at the White
House for a news conference on the agreement, Bentsen had a White
House staffer use whiteout to erase the heating oil exemption.
   Dukakis told a news conference in Boston that Bentsen told him
the heating oil exemption was put in the agreement without his
knowledge.
   ``He was very upset and said it had to include heating oil or
nothing at all,'' Dukakis said.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Rally, Oil Soars in Chart-Based Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices rose sharply and oil futures soared
Wednesday in moves that analysts said were inspired more by
technical factors than developments in the Persian Gulf.
   On other commodity markets, copper futures rallied; grains and
soybeans advanced; and grains and soybeans were mostly higher.
   Gold futures settled $4.50 to $4.80 higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in October at
$393.90 a troy ounce; silver was 0.7 cent to 1.1 cents higher with
October at $4.69 a troy ounce.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil
settled 74 cents to $3.37 higher with November at $37.32 a barrel;
wholesale heating oil was 2.55 cents to 7.38 cents higher with
November at 99.41 cents a gallon; wholesale unleaded gasoline ended
1.59 cents to 6.21 cents higher with November at 93.14 cents a
gallon.
   The advances in both the precious metal and energy markets
resembled similar run-ups that have occurred whenever tensions
increased significantly in the 2-month-old U.S.-Iraqi confrontation
in the Middle East. But this time there was no news to trigger the
surge in prices.
   Instead, analysts linked the rise in prices mainly to bullish
chart patterns and perceptions that recent losses were overdone.
   ``It was more technical than anything else,'' said Tom Bentz,
director of petroleum trading for United Energy Inc.
   He said crude oil opened moderately higher in reaction to
Tuesday's American Petroleum Institute report of
lower-than-expected U.S. crude supplies, then held fairly steady
for several hours until the November price edged above $35.60 a
barrel, the opening price of the previous session.
   ``Then it seemed like it started to snowball,'' Bentz said.
``Buying started coming in and that started bringing more technical
buying back into the market.''
   Gold's advance also was a mostly technical affair, analysts
said, although signs of some large-scale bullion purchases lent
strength to futures.
   Peter Cardillo, director of commodity trading with Jesup,
Josephthal &amp; Co., said the rally reflected investor confidence in
the market after the December gold contract bounced off the $390
level Tuesday. December gold settled at $393.90 Tuesday and at
$398.50 Wednesday.
   Technical factors and concerns about near-term supply tightness
helped boost copper futures prices on the Commodity Exchange.
   Copper settled 1.25 cents to 3.45 cents higher with October at
$1.30 a pound.
   Soybean futures prices climbed sharply on the Chicago Board of
Trade, leading grain futures higher amid talk that the Soviet Union
was on an international agricultural buying binge.
   The rumors were partially confirmed after the close when the
Agriculture Department reported a sale of 150,000 metric tons of
U.S. soybean meal to the Soviets.
   Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain
trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said Moscow was
rumored to have bought as much as 900,000 metric tons of soybean
meal from U.S., South American and European suppliers and 5 million
tons of grain from Canada.
   The Soviets also were said to have bought as much as 8 million
metric tons of various agricultural commodities from all over the
world since Tuesday, Lespinasse said.
   Soybean meal for October delivery rocketed $8 to $183.50 a ton.
   Wheat futures settled 1{ cents to 3 cents higher with December
at $2.74\ a bushel; corn was 2\ cents to 3} cents higher with
December at $2.29 a bushel; oats were { cent to 1{ cents higher
with December at $1.23} a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 13}
cents higher with November at $6.20 a bushel.
   Most pork belly futures rose the permitted daily limit of 2
cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for the third
straight day, reflecting rising cash prices and heavy usage of
frozen stocks, analysts said.
   The belly market lent strength to hog futures but cattle futures
finished narrowly mixed after a day of choppy trading amid
conflicting perceptions about the cash market's future direction.
   Live cattle finished .15 cent lower to .30 cent higher with
October at 79.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower
to .28 cent higher with October at 87.75 cents a pound; live hogs
were unchanged to 1 cent higher with October at 56.60 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.93 cents to 2 cents higher with
February at 64.20 cents a pound.

   Oil shot up more than $3 per barrel Wednesday,
as war worries returned to the futures market in a rally that
proved surprising even to traders who have grown accustomed to wild
swings.
   ``It wasn't one headline,'' said Ron Caples, a broker with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``It wasn't one speech or one action
or one rumor. The easiest way to describe it is the war premium is
back, at least for today. I don't want to go out on a limb and
predict prices tomorrow.''
   Contracts for November delivery of light sweet crude oil closed
$3.37 higher at $37.32 per barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Later contract months all closed higher as oil made a
substantial rebound from back-to-back dives Monday and Tuesday that
totaled more than $5 a barrel.
   Oil had opened slightly stronger Wednesday on an industry report
showing the nation's crude supply went down by 9.4 million barrels
last week, as well as news that Secretary of State James A. Baker
III said he had found growing international support for a military
strike against Iraq.
   But after several hours of lackluster trading, oil suddenly
began surging ahead late in the afternoon, led by strong buying
from the large trading houses. The reason for the jump seemed to
elude professional traders.
   The rally may have been helped by news that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein had gone to Kuwait, the oil-rich nation he conquered
in August.
   ``A lot of people are feeling if he was down there, then maybe
he was planning new strategies with his generals or whatever,''
said Thomas Blakeslee, an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric
Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J.
   Others said Saddam's visit to the occupied territory could not
fully explain the rally.
   Home heating oil and unleaded gasoline contracts followed crude
futures, as they have throughout the volatile week.
   Heating oil rose 7.38 cents to 99.41 cents per gallon for
November delivery, with later months all closing higher.
   Unleaded gasoline went up 6.21 cents to 93.14 cents per gallon
fo November delivery, with later months closing higher.
   Natural gas contracts all traded higher, with November contracts
rising 3.5 cents to $1.915 per 1,000 cubic feet.

<HEAD>Collapse of High-Rise Bailout Deals FHA Largest Claim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will take over a luxury high-rise
development that borrowed almost $159 million in federally backed
money in what officials called the biggest federal mortgage
insurance program bailout.
   Federal housing officials and developers of the financially
troubled Presidential Towers apartments failed to meet an Oct. 1
deadline to agree on a proposed $16 million loan to help the
project stay solvent, both sides said Wednesday.
   The money would have forestalled a default on loans developers
obtained to build the 2,346-unit high-rise, which opened in 1985 on
the west edge of the city's downtown.
   The federal government now must repay the loans and take over as
lender, spokesmen for both sides indicated.
   The tab is the biggest in the history of the Federal Housing
Administration's mortgage insurance program, said Bill Glavin, a
spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
which oversees the FHA.
   Glavin said HUD hopes to foreclose on the project in six months.
When HUD takes over such a project, it generally sells the
property, he added.
   Douglas R. Woodworth, a spokesman for the developers, said they
would try to negotiate an arrangement ``we think would be less
costly to the government than a foreclosure.''
   Such a deal could occur under a special program that would allow
HUD's immediate payout to be limited to $40 million, reducing the
first mortgage by that amount. The developers would owe the $40
million to HUD as a second mortgage they would pay later, Woodworth
said.
   HUD would gain by not having to take a large loss at one time to
its insurance fund but could suffer greater losses in the future.
Developers Daniel E. Levin, James P. McHugh and Daniel J. Shannon
would gain by buying time until the project becomes
self-sustaining, which HUD said could take up to eight years.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp favored the $16 million bailout only if
the developers could raise $13 million of their own, which Glavin
said they could not or would not do.
   Kemp said in Chicago last month that ``there should never have
been this type of federally guaranteed investment'' as the one that
backed loans to Presidential Towers.
   The 48-story, four-building complex was built over the
objections of community activists who said it would displace many
poor and homeless people.
   It is about 90 percent occupied. Its 3,100 tenants are mostly
young professionals and should not be affected by the project's
latest financial troubles, Woodworth said.

<TEXT>
   Sen. John Glenn met privately with the Senate
Ethics Committee on Wednesday and said he thoroughly discussed all
aspects of his assistance for Charles H. Keating Jr. while the
businessman's savings and loan was collapsing.
   Glenn, one of five senators who intervened with regulators for
Keating and also accepted political donations from him, met with
the committee in private for 2{ hours. He later declined to reveal
the substance of the discussions.
   ``I survived,'' the Ohio Democrat told reporters. ``I
appreciated very much the fact that the committee would take the
time to discuss this whole issue with me, which we did. There was
adequate time to present everything.''
   The committee's vice chairman, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said
no decision on Glenn's case had been made.
   Glenn was the first of the five senators summoned to a committee
meeting to explain their help for Keating.
   Appearing individually at closed hearings this week and next,
the senators will explain their intervention with U.S. banking
regulators and their acceptance of a total of $1.3 million in
political donations from Keating and his associates.
   Congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have
said committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett recommended cases
be dismissed against Glenn and John McCain of Arizona, the only
Republican among the five. McCain is scheduled to appear Thursday.
   The six-member committee has not acted on Bennett's
recommendation, nor on his conclusion that cases proceed against
Democratic Sens. Alan Cranston of California, Dennis DeConcini of
Arizona and Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan.
   A decision to continue any of the cases could bring hearings in
which Bennett and defense lawyers would oppose each other in a
trial-like setting; the committee would sit as a jury.
   The panel has the authority to rebuke by letter any senator
found in violation of standards of conduct, or it could recommend
full Senate sanctions of censure or expulsion.
   Keating and his associates donated $200,000 in the fall of 1985
and spring of 1986 to the National Council on Public Policy, a
political action committee that promoted Glenn's issues and paid
for travel after his 1984 presidential bid collapsed.
   Glenn also received $34,000 in direct contributions for his
campaigns.
   Bennett's report, according to congressional sources, makes
connections between the timing of Keating's contributions and
actions taken by the senators.
   ``The conclusion was there was no connection between the
contributions and actions'' of Glenn and McCain, one source said
earlier this week.
   Federal regulators had already concluded that Keating's Lincoln
Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif., was heading toward failure when
the senators held two crucial meetings in April 1987.
   The thrift wasn't seized by the government until April 1989, by
which time the government was stuck with a bailout cost that could
exceed $2 billion.
   All the senators under investigation, except Riegle, met April
2, 1987, with Edwin J. Gray, then chairman of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board. Gray contended the senators offered a deal to aid
Keating, but each lawmaker vigorously denied that account.
   A week later, all five senators met with the San Francisco-based
examiners who were investigating Lincoln. And, according to a
regulator's transcript, the lawmakers were told that criminal
referrals would be made to the Justice Department.
   It was at the second meeting, according to the transcript, that
Glenn made the oft-quoted comment: ``To be blunt, you should charge
them or get off their backs.''
   Glenn has said previously that if he had learned earlier about
the potential criminality, ``there would have been no point in
holding either meeting, and I would not have attended. I attended
no further meetings on this subject, nor did I discuss the matter
further with any member of the FHLBB or its staff.''
   At another point, Glenn said that if Keating thought campaign
contributions would buy influence, then ``John Glenn must have been
the biggest disappointment to him than anybody he contributed to.''

<HEAD>Lewd Parties Lead Regulators To Study Possible Nynex Breakup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BELLAFIORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State utility regulators, concerned about
lewd parties for Nynex employees and vendors that included
prostitutes, authorized a study Wednesday into whether the
telephone holding company should be broken up.
   The study was recommended by the chief lawyer to the state
Public Service Commission, William Cowan, in part to try to prevent
future conventions such as the ones held in Florida by Nynex's
Materiel Enterprises Co.
   Materiel Enterprises was the purchasing subsidiary of Nynex, the
regional ``baby bell'' company that owns New York Telephone Co. and
New England Telephone Co. At the time of the parties, Materiel
Enterprises was not government regulated, as are the telephone
companies.
   The regulatory commission is investigating whether vendors who
attended the annual weeklng bashes may have received special
treatment when they later pursued business deals with Materiel
Enterprises.
   New York Telephone had been ordered to purchase supplies from
Materiel Enterprises at higher prices than the company would have
paid on the open market, state Attorney General Robert Abrams has
charged. Those higher costs may have been passed on to customers
through higher rates, he said.
   In February, the Federal Communications Commission ordered fines
totaling $1.4 million against New York Telephone and New England
Telephone because of $118.5 alleged overcharges made to the two
units by Materiel Enterprises.
   New York Telephone is asking for a $900 million rate increase.
The utility commission said Wednesday it would separate the
Materiel Enterprises case from the rate hike case because it might
take too long to complete its Materiel Enterprises investigation.
   Nynex, in a two-paragraph statement, said divestiture was ``not
an option'' it would consider. But the company said it would
cooperate with the commission in resolving the problems cited by
the report.
   Nynex stock fell 75 cents a share to close at $71.62{ in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday.
   Previously, Nynex spokesman Peter Goodale has said that an
analysis of the company's dealings with its vendors found no
correlation between the amount of business awarded and attendance
at the conventions.
   In his report to the utility commission, Cowan said he believed
that customers could be better served if New York Telephone was
split off from Nynex.
   ``The manner in which this corporation (Nynex) has handled
itself since divestiture in 1984 raises serious and troubling
questions about its management agenda, its business purposes and
the future direction in which it will lead the New York Telephone
Co., unless changes are made,'' Cowan said.
   It was unclear Wednesday whether the utility commission has the
authority to order Nynex to divest New York Telephone.
   However, Bradford said, there were structural changes besides
divestiture that could loosen the relationship between Nynex and
its two telephone companies.
   Aides to Abrams called the recommendation to study a Nynex
breakup a ``bombshell.'' They said it had not been tried in any
other states.
   Utility commissioner James McFarland, while not endorsing the
notion of divestiture, said the Nynex purchasing practices
involving Materiel Enterprises were full of ``chicanery and
venality, if not criminality.''
   The annual booze and sex blasts were arranged by Materiel
Enterprises executive Lawrence Friedman, who was fired in 1988 by
Nynex.
   Friedman later received a $1 million settlement from Nynex after
suing the company for alleged religious discrimination. Nynex said
it fired Friedman for misconduct while Friedman claimed it was
because he is Jewish.
   On Tuesday, Nynex said it merged Materiel Enterprises with
another unit, Nynex Services Co., to form a new subsidiary called
Telesector Resources Group Inc. Nynex said it will provide
centralized planning, marketing and purchasing to New York
Telephone and New England Telephone.

<HEAD>Chartwell Reps Resign From Special Avon Panel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chartwell Associates said Wednesday that its
representatives have quit a special Avon Products Inc. committee
because the panel seems unwilling to fulfill its mission of finding
ways to increase the value of the cosmetics company.
   Avon responded that its special committee will continue to
examine alternatives to enhance stockholder value despite the
resignation of the two Chartwell members.
   The announcements indicate a rift has occurred in the delicate
relations between the big beauty products marketer and the limited
partnership that has been stalking it.
   Formation of the panel was part of a truce worked out in the
spring under which Chartwell agreed not to wage a threatened proxy
fight against Avon. Under the settlement, Avon supported Chartwell
nominees to two of the four slots available on Avon's board. They
were elected at the May annual meetig.
   The news encouraged buying in Avon stock, which rose $1.25 to
$26.75 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday.
   Chartwell issued a news release Wednesday criticizing Avon's
senior management and the special committee for failing to show
``any desire or determination'' to fulfill the committee's original
charge.
   The Chartwell representatives said they could not ``sit idly by
and condone inaction'' so they decided to submit their
resignations.
   ``We will continue to work toward finding a means to fulfill our
obligation to all Avon shareholders - a means that will be
satisfactory to Avon's board and management,'' Chartwell's
representatives said.
   Joseph Rice, an Avon board member who is chairman of the special
committee, said in a news release that the remaining panel
participants would continue to look at a broad range of
alternatives. Nothing has been ruled out yet, he said.
   Among the alternatives under review are a recapitalization of
Avon, asset sales and sale of the entire company, Avon has said in
the past.
   Chartwell has exerted pressure on Avon on and off since last
November. A principal in Chartwell, John P. Rochon, who is vice
chairman of the makeup marketing company Mary Kay, has made several
takeover advances on Avon.
   Others in the limited partnership include the Fisher brothers of
New York and the Getty Family Trust.
   The partnership has periodically boosted its holdings of Avon
stock and is believed to have about 19.8 percent of Avon's voting
stock. Chartwell has said that its intends to be a long-term
investor in Avon and has not indicated that it plans to launch a
hostile bid for the company.

<HEAD>Worst Model Year Since '83, But Auto Sales Rate May Be
Strengthening</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Auto Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>

   Sales of North American-made cars and trucks
dropped 3.7 percent in late September, capping the worst model year
since 1983 when the industry was struggling back from the dark days
of the early '80s, automakers reported Wednesday.
   The Honda Accord was the best-selling car of the 1990 model
year, easily topping the No. 2 Ford Taurus.
   The 10 major domestic automakers reported selling an average of
44,443 cars and trucks during the Sept. 21-30 period this year,
compared with an average of 46,158 during the same time last year.
   Domestic car sales were nearly even and truck sales dropped 10.4
percent.
   Car sales by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. fell 5.1 percent during the period while sales of cars made
in Japanese plants in North America rose 40.4 percent.
   The Big Three held 84.3 percent of the domestic car market
during the period.
   The late-September sales came against a time last year when
automakers offered more attractive incentives than they did this
year.
   Auto analyst David Healy of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in New York
said the late-September sales rate was healthy.
   ``Cars for the 10 days were a good deal stronger than I
figured,'' he said. ``Truck sales look to be the weakest all year.
   ``Maybe there is a shift in (car and truck) mix going on because
of gasoline prices, but it's a little early to tell,'' he said.
   Automakers have been saying for more tan a month that they
haven't seen any effects on sales directly related to rising
gasoline prices stemming from the Mideast crisis.
   ``Nevertheless,'' Ford sales Vice President Robert Rewey said
Wednesday, ``consumer confidence has experienced its steepest
decline since 1981.''
   For the first nine months of this year, and with imported cars
and trucks counted in, automakers said their sales dropped 5.9
percent compared with the same period last year. Car sales were
down 6 percent and truck sales were off 5.7 percent.
   However, the underlying demand for cars and trucks has been
strengthening in recent months, Healy said.
   ``It looks like the sales rate may have bottomed out,'' he said.
``Even with the Middle East and scary gasoline prices and threat of
war and big drops in consumer confidence surveys, you get better
vehicle sales (now) than you had for the last 12 months.''
   Sales in the 1990 model year wound up 7.9 percent behind the
1989 model year. When heavy trucks are counted in later, it's
likely that about 14.2 million cars and trucks will have been sold
during the 12 months ending with September.
   About 11.7 million vehicles were sold in the 1983 model year,
just after the country emerged from a recession and before the
start of the selling boom of the mid- and late-1980s.
   ``I think that the American consumers' overbuying of cars in the
late-'80s has finally caught up to them,'' Healy said. ``I think a
lot of people were staying home paying for their old cars rather
than buying new ones.''
   Honda can be especially pleased with sales of its Accord. It
easily captured the honor of being the most popular car in the 1990
model year with sales of 418,177. That was 32 percent more than the
Ford Taurus with 316,906.
   Included in the Taurus figure is a sizeable number of sales to
fleet customers, such as rental car and taxi companies. Honda does
little fleet business, making the difference in retail sales
larger.
   The best-selling vehicle overall, though, was the Ford F-Series
full-size pickup truck at 538,040 for the model year. The Chevrolet
C-K Series of full-size pickups was second at 486,104.

<HEAD>Congressional Witnesses: Not Much Fruit In These `Roll-Ups'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee began an inquiry
Wednesday into whether a new version of limited partnerships that
can be publicly traded hurt small, often unsophisticated investors.
   Critics brand the investments, called ``roll-ups,'' as legalized
embezzlement and say they should be banned. Industry supporters,
meanwhile, concede more disclosure is needed in the often lengthy
and baffling documents that accompany a roll-up proposal.
   ``There isn't one broker on Wall Street who's been in the
business maybe two months, who owns a limited partnership. Not one!
It is a suicidal investment for idiots,'' Scott Miller told the
finance subcommitte of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Miller, a Houston, Texas, consultant and researcher on limited
partnerships, was among several witnesses who called for an
outright ban of roll-ups, which are often developed when a limited
partnership's earnings sour.
   Others, like Mark J. Sletten, president of the Real Estate
Investment Association, said there should be some modification of
the rules but opposed ``the outright prohibition of roll-ups.''
   Limited partnerships are investment vehicles, usually sold
through brokerage firms, in which investors known as limited
partners put up between $5,000 and $10,000. The money often goes
towards real estate or oil and natural gas drilling projects.
   In return they get income, capital gains and tax benefits.
   The partnerships are usually run by one or more general
partners, who bear all the responsibility for running the business
in return for management fees and a percentage of the profits.
   Through the late 1980s, however, many partnerships have been
losing propositions because of troubles in the real estate and
energy markets.
   As real estate values have fallen, general partners of several
limited partnerships have combined the businesses - the winners and
losers - into one entity that is then publicly traded. The move has
to be approved by the limited partners.
   ``Roll-ups may be the only recourse left to general partners in
the months ahead if the overall slide in real estate values
continues,'' said Christopher L. Davis, president of the Investment
Partnership Association.
   It frees the limited partners from the lengthy obligation to
stay in the partnership for five to 10 years. However, shares in
the new entity are often hard to sell and the value of the original
investment usually drops when they hit the public market.
   ``As a rule, roll-ups involve fraud, self-dealing, theft of
limited partnership assets, and all rolled together theft,'' said
economist and writer Benjamin J. Stein of Malibu, Calif.
   He and other opponents said when the term of the partnership
ends, the limited partners get their money back, but in a roll-up,
the investment vehicle becomes perpetual and the proceeds are
reinvested into the partnership.
   They also claimed that the deck is stacked against small
investors who may not know that the promotional materials and
prospectus for the roll-up is being paid for with their money; that
the ``independent'' investment banker who has reviewed the roll-up
is being paid by the general partner who also pays a commission to
brokers who obtain a `yes' vote for the roll-up.
   And all of this is legal.
   Davis, the Investment Partnership Association, said rather than
eliminate investment partnerships, limited partners should be given
all the information they need to make intelligent decisions when
voting on a proposed roll-up.
   That would include: an easilly understandable summary in the
first few pages; a comparison of compensation under the exisiting
partnership and under the proposed new entity and the ability to
sell partnership interest both before and after a roll-up.
   But in his opening remarks, Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., the
subcommittee's chairman, said current information available to
investors is hard to wade through.
   ``It's widely acknowledged on Wall Street and off that
disclosure documents have become so complex and convoluted as to
become incomprehensible to all but the most sophisticated
investors,'' he said.
   Markey said he and Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., have asked the
Securities and Exchange Commission to study the issue and report
back to Congress.

<TEXT>
   Salt Lake City, with its well-skilled workers,
convenient transportation and low taxes, was rated tops for
business in a Fortune Magazine survey released Wednesday.
   New York, plagued by troubled schools and sky-high wages, was
not included in the magazine's top-10 city list this year after
ranking No. 6 last year.
   The current top-10 list, published in Fortune's Oct. 22 issue,
will hit most newsstands on Oct. 8.
   The magazine said the survey was based partly on a poll
conducted by the relocation consulting firm of Moran Stahl &amp; Boyer,
which queried personnel executives in the 50 largest metropolitan
areas. Fortune also said the rankings were based on its own
interviews with hundreds of business and community leaders and
government officials.
   Fortune said it changed the criteria from last year to put
greater stress on education and the quality of the workforce. Last
year's broader quality-of-life criteria put Dallas, Atlanta and
Kansas City at the top of the list.
   This year's leader, Salt Lake City, was singled out for its high
literacy rate and overall quality of life. The survey added that
its sedate downtown should be invigorated soon by a planned $500
million redevelopment.
   Others in the top-ten, in order:
   - Minneapolis-St. Paul - ``among America's cleanest, safest
metropolitan areas'';
   - Atlanta - ``fine climate, affordable housing, first-class
international airport and rapid transit, scores of golf courses'';
   - Sacramento, Calif. - ``homes at half the price of San
Francisco and Los Angeles and generally better schools'';
   - Austin, Texas - ``better schools and lower labor costs than
its bigger sisters Dallas and Houston'';
   - Columbus, Ohio - ``affordable housing and good schools in an
ethnically diverse city'';
   - Dallas-Fort Worth - ``affordable homes, low state and local
taxes,andthe smell of economic recovery'';
   - Phoenix - ``schools excel, workers are well educated, and a
large community college system answers business's needs'';
   - Jacksonville, Fla. - ``schools aren't exceptional...but
Florida's generous job training programs and low taxes help
compensate'';
   - Oklahoma City - ``real estate markets are a buyer's
paradise...and city and state offer some of America's best job
training and adult education.''
   Seattle, which didn't make Fortune's list, was rated the best
place to locate in an annual survey of 400 business executives
released Tuesday by the commercial real estate firm of Cushman &amp;
Wakefield. Fortune's No. 1 choice didn't make the Cushman &amp;
Wakefield survey.

   Here are sales results for the 10 major U.S.
automakers for third period of September 1990.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were eight selling days in the period this year and nine
selling days last year.
   For the month, there were 24 selling days this year and 25
selling days last year, and for the year so far, 230 selling days
this year and 230 selling days last year.
   There were 306 selling days in the 1990 model year and 307
selling days in the 1989 model year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru, Isuzu and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic
and appear in this table separately and combined as transplant
cars.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign.

<TEXT>
   Beatrice Alexander Behrman, founder of an early
U.S. doll company whose handcrafted Madame Alexander dolls became
collector's items and were exhibited in museums around the world,
died Wednesday at age 95.
   Mrs. Behrman, who was widely known as Madame Alexander, died of
natural causes at her home in Palm Beach, Fla., said spokesman Beau
James. She founded the Alexander Doll Co. in 1923 and sold it to
two New York businessmen in 1988 but remained a consultant.
   Madame Alexander dolls take up to three weeks to craft by hand
and are the foremost collectible dolls in the world. The company
has introduced more than 5,000 different dolls.
   Her doll collections were based on fantasy, historic events,
literature, music art and movies. ``I made dolls for children to
play with and learn from of life and of art,'' she said in an
interview several years ago.
   Mrs. Behrman was the daughter of a Russian immigrant who moved
to New York and established his own toy shop and the country's
first doll hospital. During World War I, she designed and helped
make ``Red Cross Nurse'' rag dolls that were sold by her father's
company.
   She was inspired to start her own line of dolls after shipments
of European dolls to the United States virtually ceased during
World War I. Her husband, Philip Behrman, quit his job with a New
York hat company to run the business end of his wife's firm.
   Mrs. Behrman became known as Madame Alexander in the doll world
with the first of her dolls, rag dolls with mask-type features and
pressed features that she hand-painted. The emphasis on facial
features was a departure from old-fashioned rag dolls with flat
faces.
   By the 1930s, she started making dolls whose heads had painted
features and eyes that closed. Madame Alexander dolls emphasized
lifelike details, right down to the knuckles of fingers and
eyelashes. The dolls also were known for their rooted and
elaborately styled hair and stylish clothes.
   After World War II, she followed the trend to plastic, and made
dolls with vinyl heads and vinyl, hard plastic or cloth bodies.
   In the early 1950s, she won the Fashion Academy Award for her
doll clothing designs. Clothes of all sizes, not just miniatures,
compete for the award.
   The British government commissioned a special design of Madame
Alexander dolls representing Queen Elizabeth II before and after
her coronation in 1953, and her sister, Princess Margaret.
   In 1968, the Smithsonian Institution chose two dolls to include
in its doll collection: the ``Madame'' doll, based on the American
Revolution, and the ``Scarlett O'Hara'' doll from ``Gone With the
Wind.''
   Other well-known dolls were inspired by Alice in Wonderland, the
four sisters in ``Little Women,'' and characters from Charles
Dickens' books. Her line of ``Portrait Dolls'' began production in
the early 1940s. Up to 21 inches tall, the dolls included ``Orphan
Annie,'' ``Renoir Girl'' and ``Nancy Drew.''
   New dolls range in price from $40 to $500, while collector items
sell for as much as $5,000.
   The Alexander Doll Co., headquartered in Harlem, is that area's
largest private employer, with 650 employees.
   Survivors include Mrs. Behrman's daughter, Mildred, and a
grandson. Funeral services will be held Sunday at the Riverside
Memorial Chapel in Manhattan.

<HEAD>Matsushita To Send Executives to U.S. To Finalize MCA Buyout</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 6th graf to CLARIFY that Matsushita proposal does not
include television stations.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer electronics giant Matsushita Electric
Industries Co. said Thursday its executives begin meeting with MCA
Inc. officials as the Japanese firm pursues a buyout of the
entertainment conglomerate.
   ``Until now, we have been approached by MCA through a third
agent, but we finally reached the stage of direct negotiations,''
said Matsushita spokeswoman Toshiko Inui.
   She said Matsushita will send its executives to the United
States soon to negotiate with MCA representatives for a possible
agreement.
   Ms. Inui would not elaborate on the negotiations.
   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic journal,
reported Thursday that Matsushita wants to buy MCA's film and music
divisions for $6 billion. That leaves out MCA's theme-park
business.
   The Nihon Keizai said MCA has told Matsushita that it wants more
than $7.53 billion for all of its divisions except its television
stations.
   If realized, the deal would be the largest purchase of an
American firm by a Japanese company.
   Matsushita said in a press release it is possible that contacts
between the two companies may not lead to a merger or even another
form of business partnership.
   With its 163 consolidated subsidiaries, Matsushita Electric is
Japan's third largest corporation and the world's 16th largest in
1989, according to Fortune Magazine.
   The company's annual report forecasts total sales of more than
44 billion dollars this year.
   Last year, Sony Corp. acquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment,
in large part to gain control over the American movie studio's rich
library of old films and television shows.
   Analysts say purchases of film libraries allow consumer
electronics companies to release old movies and television shows in
the format for videotape recorders they manufacture, a key sales
strategy, and also provide material for future high-definition
television recordings.
   MCA's stock rose $3.87{ to $63.50 on the New York Stock Exchange
Wednesday. MCA was trading for about $34 per share before reports
of a possible deal surfaced Sept. 25. Matsushita's stock has risen
to 1,920 yen ($14) on Oct. 3 from 1,630 yen ($12) on Sept. 25 on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

<BYLINE>HIBERNATING INVESTORS: Analysts Diagnose Full-Blown Bear Market</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   NEW YORK - On Oct. 13, 1989, Wall Street was suddenly faced with
a problem. A planned buyout of UAL Corp., the big airline holding
company, collapsed for want of financing, touching off a
``mini-crash'' in stock prices. Today, nearly a year later, Wall
Street still has that problem - plus a long list of others that
have since all but overshadowed it. Together, they constitute what
analysts have diagnosed as the first full-blown bear market in
nearly a decade.

   NEW YORK - It was a year ago that the failure of the $6.7
billion buyout of Federated Department Stores Inc. brought the
1980s takeover boom to a halt, rocked the junk bond and stock
markets and led eventually to the collapse of the investment firm
Drexel Burnham Lambert. Today, not only has the merger business
recovered, but analysts find there was a lot of good among the
excesses of the buyout binge.

   NEW YORK - When things started looking bleak for Bloomingdale's
corporate parent last autumn, a Manhattan movie theater near the
famous department store proclaimed on its marquee ``Good Luck
Bloomies.'' Now, a photograph of that message hangs on the wall
outside the seventh floor board room at the Bloomingdale's
headquarters. Luck and a lot of good will by suppliers have helped
Bloomingdale's and its eight sister chains of U.S. department
stores cope well with life in bankruptcy court. Adaptations have
had to be made, but, to customers, nothing much has changed.

<BYLINE>BRANCHING OUT: Citibank Making Push For Japanese Consumers</BYLINE>

   TOKYO - When Citibank opened its 10th branch in Japan over the
summer, it handed out fliers reading, ``Best Bank Citibank,'' and
offered crisp $10 bills to the first 1,000 customers opening
foreign currency accounts. Such an aggressive marketing strategy is
unheard of in this country, where banks usually agree among
themselves what is permissible activity. But Citibank has been
challenging those rules lately - and shaking up the financial
community - as it makes its first major push into consumer banking
since establishing itself in Japan nearly a century ago.
