<HEAD>Ontario Indians Remove Rail Blockade; Armed Standoff Continues in
Oka</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRANTFORD, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indians dismantled their blockade of
railroad tracks near Brantford, Ontario, on Sunday after the
railway obtained a court injunction.
   Members of the Six Nations Indian Band blockaded the CN Rail
tracks running through their reserve about 12 miles southeast of
Brantford last Wednesday to press land claims and show support for
the Mohawks on the Kahnesatake settlement near Oka in Quebec.
   CN Rail obtained a court injunction ordering the removal of the
blockade late Saturday, and provincial police said the natives
removed a snow plow on the tracks without incident.
   ``We're not lawbreakers,'' said Bill Montour, a chief on the
reserve. ``It was an order by the Ontario court. We lost the
battle, but we're still fighting the war.''
   Other members of the Six Nations Band continued to block two
highways near Brantford and Caledonia, said police Sgt. Bob Adams.
Those blockades have been in place for a week, and police were
directing traffic around the area.
   At the Kahnesatake settlement, 18 miles west of Montreal, about
400 troops continued to surround a group of about 20 armed Mohawk
men and 30 women and children.
   The Mohawks retreated to a detoxification center in a small
wooded area after Quebec authorities ordered troops into the
settlement last weekend to dismantle barricades put up by the
Indians.
   On Saturday, a 51-year-old Mohawk, Tie Tiertakaron, was taken by
ambulance to a Montreal hospital after he was injured in a fight
with four soldiers. Tiertakaron was being kept under observation at
Montreal General Hospital after suffering head injuries, bruises
and lacerations, hospital spokeswoman Joan Lamontagne said.
   Mohawks said Tiertakaron was asleep when he was attacked and
beaten severely by soldiers inside Mohawk lines around the
detoxification center.
   The army said the soldiers acted in self-defense after the
Mohawk attacked them while they were on a reconnaissance mission.
Two soldiers suffered minor knife wounds in the incident.
   The Mohawks have said they won't lay down their arms without
assurances that they will be protected from reprisals by Quebec
provincial police.
   Indian leaders have proposed setting up a native peacekeeping
force for the settlement. Canadian authorities have rejected this
proposal.
   A Quebec police officer was killed July 11 when the provincial
police stormed a Mohawk barricade erected to protest a decision by
the town of Oka to expand a municipal golf course onto land claimed
by the Indians.
   The dispute over the golf course expansion was resolved when the
federal government purchased the land and said it would give it to
the Indians. But the Mohawks have raised a wider range of
grievances, including demands for sovereignty.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. employees of the Reuters news agency have
authorized their union leadership to call a strike against the
company, the Newspaper Guild of New York announced Monday.
   Guild members voted by a larger than 20-1 margin last week for
the authorization after contract talks that began nearly a year ago
failed to result in an agreement. The Guild represents nearly 500
employees, including 150 journalists.
   The Newspaper Guild, in a news release, blamed the failing talks
on ``Reuters' demands that it substantially raise the cost to
employees for their health insurance'' while cutting maternity
benefits and severance pay.
   Andrew Nibley, Reuters' editor responsible for North America and
Latin America, refused to discuss details of the negotiations while
they are in progress.
   ``I would say that all major U.S. corporations are dealing with
the whole issue of spiraling health care costs and how they can be
contained. We think that our salaries are quite competitive and
among the best in the industry,'' he said.
   ``I don't think a strike would be in anyone's interest and I
certainly hope it doesn't come to that,'' he added.
   Already, Reuters' employees have engaged in informational
picketing at the New York and American stock exchanges and at
Reuters offices.
   The Guild represents journalists, technicians, computer
operators, sales support staff, customer service and clerical
employees. The last contract expired in February.
   Salaries at Reuters range from $636 to $806 a week for
reporters. Correspondents can make up to $955. Office assistants
start at $258.42 per week while salaries for technicians range from
$617 to $697.

<HEAD>Professor Campaigns to Keep U.S. Cigarettes Out of Thailand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You can't buy American cigarettes in
Thailand, at least not legally. That has a lot to do with Ted Chen.
   The University of Massachusetts public health professor has
worked to prevent the U.S. tobacco industry from breaking into the
Thai market. Chen blasts efforts to promote American tobacco in
Asia as the ``new opium wars.''
   ``I feel strongly about the health effects of cigarette smoking
and I feel that if we just stop 1 percent of the increase, that
would mean millions of people's lives are saved,'' said Chen, who
emigrated from Taiwan 26 years ago.
   Thailand's ban on American cigarettes has been the focus of a
two-year battle between trade and tobacco industry officials and
public health groups.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills has threatened that unless
Thailand relaxes its ban by November, Thai imports will be banned
in an amount equal to the cigarettes that might have been sold _ an
estimated $166 million a year.
   ``On the one hand the United States is the champion of world
health for many years. ... On the other hand, now you're getting
this image of becoming the major pusher or the major dealer of
tobacco. It's really selling out the image of America,'' said Chen,
executive secretary for the Asian Pacific Association for Control
of Tobacco, which he founded.
   U.S. trade officials say they are merely trying to break a Thai
monopoly on cigarettes.
   ``We seek and try to root out trade barriers wherever we find
them,'' said Timothy O'Leary, a spokesman for Hills. ``I feel that
the opponents of what we're doing have their hearts in the right
place, but their energies are misdirected. We feel that we're doing
what the law says we need to do.''
   In his fight against tobacco, Chen has written papers and
testified before Congress. He likens the dispute to the
19th-century opium wars, in which Western powers forced China to
buy opium so they could pay for Chinese tea and silks.
   ``Ted Chen, of course, has been a marvelous leader because he
really has a foot in both worlds. He's both an American leader and
an Asian leader,'' said Mike Pertschuk, co-director of the
Washington-based Advocacy Institute, one of the health
organizations opposing the cigarette exports.
   John Dollisson, spokesman for the U.S. Cigarette Exporters
Association in New York, said Chen and others ``have been
hoodwinked into bringing in the health issue'' when the real issue
is trade.
   ``The fact is they're (Thais) going to smoke and whether they
smoke our product or whether they're going to smoke their product,
they're going to smoke,'' he said.
   Chen and his allies counter that Thai smoking rates _ about 49
percent of males and 4 percent of females _ are likely to increase
once U.S. advertisers get into the marketplace. Taiwan, which
dropped its strict tariffs in 1987, reported a 4 percent increase
in 1988, he said.
   Cigarette advertising is banned in Thailand, but Chen said he
expects that would fall once the trade barrier is hurdled.
Dollisson maintained advertising merely promotes brands and has no
effect on overall smoking rates.
   Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass., is co-sponsoring a bill that would
ban the government from imposing trade restrictions to open new
cigarette markets.
   ``Our position is that there are more worthy products that the
U.S. government can support and that it's time to dissolve the
200-year marriage between the tobacco industry and the American
government,'' said Atkins aide Jim Kessler.

   A Soviet Sukhoi 27, an advanced jet
fighter, has plunged to earth and crashed during an air show in
this northern Italian town, officials say. Two people were reported
killed, including the Soviet pilot.
   The Italian news agency ANSA identified the dead in Sunday's
crash as Rimas Stankiavicius, an employee of the Gromov aerospace
research institute in Moscow, and a member of the security forces
keeping order at the show.
   One adult and two children in the audience of more than 40,000
suffered minor injuries, the agency said.
   The Su-27 was at the end of a loop when it suddenly plunged to
the ground. Authorities did not immediately know the reason for the
crash.
   The plane is one of the Soviet Union's most advanced fighters,
and has only been seen in the West recently.

<HEAD>Slick Celine Styles in Early Summer Showings</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smooth, beautifully cut nautical cruise-wear and
pretty pastel safari styles fanned out at an early bird summer
showing by Celine.
   If Parisiennes are casting aside their bikinis looking forward
to tweedy autumn gear, the fashion world is already dipping into
summer 1991, with menswear in the avant-garde as well. A rack show
at Porte de Versailles underlines masculine summer trends shown
last July.
   The main summer ready-to-wear shows for women do not begin until
mid-October, but Celine was stealing a march.
   This carriage-trade house, well-known for quality shoes and
bags, has recently hyped its sporty fashions _ with a new design
team under Peggy Huynh-Kinh and management by glamorous,
fashion-conscious Nan Legeai, formerly of Dior.
   The main guru behind Celine's modernism is financier Bernard
Arnault, whose consortium, Agache, took over Celine in 1987 and is
also backing Christian Lacroix and Dior.
   ``I'm enthusiastic about Celine, but cannot talk about my future
plans for the fashion holdings,'' Arnault said at a reception after
the Celine show last week.
   While dedicated to the bounding main, the crisp Celine summer
wear won't make waves. But its snappy gold-buttoned blazers or
drawstring anoraks, shorts, peppy knife-pleated or polka-dotted
miniskirts and wide-bottomed flap-fly sailor trousers in
red-white-blue combinations have a fresh appeal, even for
Parisiennes tired of a long, hot summer.
   The multicolored, horizontally striped knit jerseys in mixes of
turquoise, mocha, carmine and navy, or in navy, tobacco and white
looked ideal for holidays. They came out in slit-skirt long
sheaths, long cardigan jackets or pullover tunics and shorts.
   Safari and Morocco-inspired wear with belted glen plaid jackets,
draped sarong skirts or straight pants were slickly made in linens,
whipcord, cottons and silks.
   Desert-jacket suits looked appealing in pastels like misty pink,
banana or linden green, and suede was used in combinations of soft
mocha brown or sky blue.
   ``The cut is classic, the fabrics are good, the styles
youthful,'' said French fashion critic Vera Faure.
   Celine fans will also be glad to see so many well-made
low-heeled pumps in various suede shades or with gold toes and
heels.
   The handbags emphasize Celine's logo, for those who love
prestige labels. The gold coin and brown leather series with
``astrolab'' motifs is more subtle than the flashy, but fun, canvas
and grosgrain sailor series. And everybody in the show clanked
around with Celine's bangle-charm bracelets.
   The menswear salon recently celebrated with a gala 30th
anniversary party at the Rothschild rent-a-chateau, Ferrieres,
outside Paris.
   This latest menswear show for summer _ after runway shows last
July in Paris _ just wound up at the Porte de Versailles with a
plethora of choices from wild to strictly conservative.
   For about 900 guests feasting on smoked salmon, champagne and
pigeon, the Ferrieres party offered a restrospective video pointing
out how menswear has evolved recently from stuffed shirt to hippie
and back to fanciful sportswear for the 1990s.
   Pierre Cardin gave a brief talk celebrating the ``birth'' of
luxury menswear from France, started by himself in 1960, along with
the first menswear salon. The field of luxury menswear was soon
taken up enthusiastically by everybody from Lanvin to Yves Saint
Laurent.
   ``Color is the important message today,'' said Jonathan
Joselove, a top menswear buyer for Nieman-Marcus, who was wearing
an unstructured black Claude Montana suit for the black-tie
occasion.
   But he admits that while color does sprout in sportswear _ rust,
gold, turquoise, robin's egg blue and pink are some of the hot
shades for next summer _ the conservative suit and tie are still
the norm for most workaday Paris executives, as all over the world.

<HEAD>Panel Would Admit Cameras, Mikes to Federal Courtrooms Cautiously</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A camera tapes the day's proceedings for a
federal court juror who is sick and unable to attend the trial.
   A closed circuit video system allows a marshal to maintain a
security surveillance of the courtroom.
   Highlights of testimony in a highly publicized civil trial are
aired on the evening news.
   Such are the visions of a five-judge study committee that is
recommending a three-year, carefully controlled experiment that
would allow cameras and radio equipment to record proceedings in
federal courtrooms.
   The U.S. Judicial Conference, the policy-making arm of the
federal courts, scheduled a meeting Wednesday to consider the
proposal. The conference has 27 federal judges as its members, and
is headed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
   There are signs of erosion in the solid opposition that has kept
cameras out of federal courts.
   Rehnquist said last May that he was ``by no means averse to the
idea'' of an experimental program. Rehnquist's predecessor, Warren
E. Burger, was dead set against the idea. ``Over my dead body,''
Burger reportedly said of a proposal to televise Supreme Court
proceedings.
   And while the study committee reported that most federal judges
oppose a blanket lifting of all restrictions on cameras in the
courtroom, it said the ``substantial majority favor the committee's
more cautious, deliberative approach.''
   The panel, headed by U.S. District Judge Robert F. Peckham of
San Francisco, called the current rules governing cameras ``unduly
restrictive'' and said they should be ``expanded somewhat'' to
include security and other areas of judicial administration.
   It also voted 4-1 to open some civil _ but not criminal _
proceedings to camera coverage and broadcast.
   ``Like the chief justice, a majority of your committee is not
averse to controlled experimentation on a voluntary basis and would
like to offer federal judges the opportunity to observe the effect
of camera coverage and broadcasting of proceedings in federal
court,'' the panel wrote.
   The experiment, to begin in July 1991 if approved, would be
limited to two federal appeals courts and six trial courts. Judges
would have to volunteer their courtrooms for the experiment, and
they would have broad discretion to ``refuse, limit or terminate
media coverage of an entire case, portions thereof or testimony of
particular witnesses,'' the panel suggested.
   It said 44 states permit, in varying degrees, camera coverage of
their judicial proceedings and that most began or are continuing on
an experimental basis.
   ``The nation is on the brink of a major victory for openness in
the federal court system,'' Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier, D-Wis.,
said after the committee report was made public last month.
Kastenmeier heads a House Judiciary subcommittee that helps oversee
the courts.
   ``The committee's recommendation is excellent,'' said Timothy
Dyk, a lawyer for news organizations lobbying for cameras in court.
``It really proposes a very significant experiment.''
   No serious problems have been reported in state courts that have
allowed cameras, say Dyk and other advocates. But until now that
has not been enough to overcome the resistance of federal judges.
   Some have said they worry about losing their anonymity, that
lawyers will engage in grandstanding or that television will
provide only snippets that will distort the proceedings.
   Whatever the outcome Wednesday when the Judicial Conference
studies the Peckham committee plan, Supreme Court proceedings are
not likely to be prime-time fare anytime soon.
   The conference has no control over what the high court does, and
the justices generally have been hostile to television cameras in
their courtroom.
   Sources at the high court say the justices were turned off to
the idea after watching Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork get
roughed up verbally at televised confirmation hearings before the
Senate Judiciary Committee in 1987. Bork subsequently was rejected
by the Senate.
   Still, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the court's newest member,
told a group of visiting high school students last spring that
televising high court proceedings is ``inevitable.''

   An infant asleep on a couch. A business
executive speaking on a pay phone. A tourist standing on a subway
platform. A 78-year-old man out for an evening walk. A prosecutor
buying doughnuts.
   In the violent summer of 1990, they were among hundreds of
murder victims in New York City. Memorial Day arrived with the
Zodiac killer; the Labor Day weekend ended with a tourist from Utah
stabbed to death in the subway while defending his mother from
muggers.
   The three months in between continued a five-year trend of
escalating summer violence, experts said. Killings continued at a
record pace as the city appeared headed for a new homicide record
of more than 2,000 for the year.
   ``Clearly, this is the worst of times. The numbers are higher
than ever for murders,'' said Thomas Reppetto, head of the watchdog
Citizens Crime Commission.
   ``This has got to be the worst summer since the Son of Sam'' in
1977, said James Deady, a New Yorker for 27 years. ``And that was a
serial killer. This is much more wanton.''
   Six out of 10 New Yorkers say they would live elsewhere if they
could, and three-quarters describe the city as dangerous and dirty,
according to a Time magazine-Cable News Network poll released
Sunday.
   New York, historically and statistically, is a violent place.
The average day sees five murders, nine rapes, 256 robberies, 332
burglaries and 367 auto thefts.
   Walt Whitman, writing 150 years ago, warned: ``New York is one
of the most crime-haunted and dangerous cities in Christendom.''
   But this summer, violence was as constant as the heat. Victims
were chosen by their birth signs or their clothes. Panhandlers
turned ugly if turned down. Children asleep in their homes or cars
became shooting victims. Muggers killed cab drivers at the rate of
nearly three a month.
   ``I get the sense it was a more violent summer that usual. I
think the fact that children were killed, that an assistant DA in
the Bronx was killed _ these are people you don't expect to get
caught in the crossfire,'' said Barbara Raffel Price, dean of
graduate studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
   The summer started with a cryptic note found beside a
78-year-old shooting victim. ``Zodiac _ time to die,'' it read.
Joseph Proce, who was out for a late night walk, died 24 days after
the May 31 shooting.
   The Zodiac also shot three people who survived. Then the
mysterious killer disappeared and headlines were taken over by the
Dartman. Between June 26 and a July 12 arrest of a suspect, an
assailant used a blowgun to fire small, homemade darts at 55 women
in midtown Manhattan.
   A rash of fatal shootings involving children had Mayor David
Dinkins on the defensive around the same time. Four children, age 9
months to 9 years, were shot to death in eight days at the end of
July.
   On Sunday, Dinkins spoke at St. Patrick's Cathedral to ask New
Yorkers to ``come out from behind locked doors'' to battle violence
in the city's streets.
   ``Come out and put your eyes and ears on the streets; come out
to help stop the violence,'' said Dinkins, who joined Cardinal John
O'Connor at Mass.
   On July 31, a television executive was shot to death while
making a call at a Greenwich Village pay phone. Authorities say he
was shot by a homeless man reportedly incensed by his rebuff of a
request for spare change.
   August concluded with a double shot of violence: A prosecutor
was killed by a stray bullet as he bought doughnuts in the Bronx
and a former state senator was shot to death in his Brooklyn office
on Aug. 30.
   Three days later, Brian Watkins, 22, of Provo, Utah, in town to
see the U.S. Open tennis tournament, was stabbed to death in a
Manhattan subway station while defending his mother from muggers.
That slaying reinforced the perception of out-of-towners that New
York is out of control.
   ``It's over for New York _ a fact that becomes clearer with each
passing year,'' wrote nationally syndicated columnist Bob Greene.
   ``The cranky cabdriver and the impatient waiter seem like
charming artifacts out of a 1950s musical about New York,'' he
wrote. ``They have been replaced by the gangs with the box cutters
and the crack addicts roaming the filthy streets.''
   Reppetto called the subway slaying an almost apocryphal tale of
New York's evils: ``A mid-American family comes to New York to
attend a great world sporting event. His mother is attacked, and
he's killed in the most brutal fashion defending her.''
   ``The DA getting shot, that tennis guy _ it's sick. I couldn't
believe it,'' said Andy Donnelly, a financial analyst who moved to
Manhattan in July. ``It's like the Wild West out there.''

   Sometimes, when the pain in her belly and
her toothpick-thin legs tears at her, Lissette Rodriguez thinks of
heaven.
   ``When mom dies, I die, everyone dies, I can walk in there,''
she says in her frail voice. ``No pain in my stomach, no pain in my
knee, and I walk again.''
   Sometimes, her chest feels so tight she can't breathe.
Sometimes, those who love her can't hold her because her 40-pound
body is so brittle that she bleeds inside.
   In these excruciating moments, Sandy, as she is nicknamed,
prays. She asks God to take the pain away.
   Barely 12 years old, Sandy is dying of AIDS. For her, death is
represented by the concept of heaven, where everything is beautiful.
   ``You close your eyes and your body is not working,'' she says.
``Then you go to God, go to Jesus in a big place where he lives. My
father is in there. Everyone who dies goes there.''
   Sandy's doctor, Dr. Laura Hoyt, said every part of the girl's
body, from her head to her toes, is not working properly: her
brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, blood, immune system.
   ``We've had her on hospice care at home since last spring,'' the
doctor said. ``We are keeping her as comfortable as possible for as
long as possible. She hates being in the hospital and doesn't want
to die in the hospital.''
   Sandy is among the nearly 2,500 children under 13 who have
contracted full-blown AIDS since the epidemic began. The Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta reported in August that more than
1,300 of those children have died in the United States and its
territories.
   Sandy was born four weeks prematurely in New York City. The
woman she knows as her mother, Carmen Candelaria, is really her
aunt. Mrs. Candelaria took Sandy and another child from her own
sister when they were born because the sister was unable to care
for them.
   Sandy contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion needed because
of her early birth, Mrs. Candelaria said. The girl's natural mother
died two years ago, at age 41, after mixing Valium and alcohol at a
party, she said.
   Mrs. Candelaria said she knows nothing about Sandy's father. Her
own husband, the man Sandy knew as her father, was killed when
Sandy was 7 in a holdup in the video store he owned in Puerto Rico,
where they lived for five years.
   ``I miss my father,'' Sandy says. ``I miss him every day, every
night.''
   Sandy hasn't walked since last December. She spent from
Christmas through March in the hospital, and watched her friend
Christina from Puerto Rico die of AIDS on New Year's Eve.
   ``I was scared,'' she says. ``Soon, her eyes were closed. Her
mother is crying. Her father is crying. I started crying. I said,
`I want to see her.' She was covered. Her hair was a mess, all
gone. I miss her. She's gone to heaven. She moved from the islands
to God.''
   Mrs. Candelaria threw a big barbecue May 1 for Sandy's 12th
birthday and invited the people at the hospital who care for her.
   Sandy, who weighed 60 pounds then, mustered the strength to blow
out the candles and got icing on her nose.
   She celebrated her first communion not in a church, but in the
hospital, where she returned at the end of May when her condition
worsened.
   For Mrs. Candelaria, it was bittersweet. She is tormented by the
picture in her mind. She is unable to shake the image of a little
girl with brown hair and eyes, white lace dress and stockings,
locket around her tiny neck, in a wheelchair surrounded by nurses,
a cake decorated with the sentiments, ``Jesus Loves Lissette. We
Do, Too.''
   ``I just got sad,'' said Mrs. Candelaria. ``I wanted it to be
not in the hospital, but a real normal communion. She told me not
to cry, if I cry, she'll cry.'' They both cried.
   Sandy is attached to Mrs. Candelaria, wanting her there every
moment, even sleeping with her. Mrs. Candelaria is her shadow and
has devoted much of her life to caring for her.
   She is Mrs. Candelaria's protector, never talking to her about
the inevitable.
   ``She knows,'' Mrs. Candelaria said. ``She never talks to me
about dying. She sees me cry too many times.''
   Each day brings a new onslaught of pain for Sandy: diarrhea,
coughing, fever, fungus, itching. Her black-and-blue body is
replenished with new blood every month, transfusions to keep her
alive and platelets to help stem the disease's tide.
   A hug, a kiss, a banged foot can start internal bleeding.
   ``I have a pain in here,'' Sandy says, rubbing her stomach.
``Sometimes I throw it up. Sometimes I get mad at Doreen.''
   Doreen Small, her devoted nurse, said Sandy always fights with
her:
   ``Then she says she's sorry. I'm the focus of her anger, which
is OK. When she's in a good mood, she'll paint pictures for me. I
have a bunch of pictures.''
   A luxury for Sandy is to have her feet rubbed. She asks anyone
who is handy to accommodate her. When her cousin Lues Rivera
jokingly threatened to stop one day, she teased him in Spanish, ``I
dare you.''
   Sandy is a prisoner of her bed, cared for at home by her mother
and the Center For Hope Hospice.
   ``Don't put me in there yet,'' she orders Ms. Small, afraid she
may never get back out to do all the things she wants.
   Her bedroom is filled with a cabinet of survival gear: sterile
water, saline, gauze, diapers, dressing kits, needles to flush her
IV.
   Her link to life is a catheter that enters her chest, nourishing
her with food, vitamins, minerals and dextrose. The thrush
infection from her mouth to her stomach and the medicine have
killed her appetite.
   ``Sometimes the food at the hospital I don't like it,'' she
says. A treat for her is pizza and french fries, but she can handle
only a few bites.
   Her constant companions are her friend, Poopy, who takes her
shopping, a doll called Baby Bubbles, whom she hugs and rocks, and
the telephone. She frequently calls Poopy to take her shopping and
to chitchat. ``I want to see my grandmother and cousin ... You see
the movie `Mermaid?' I like the sound.''
   ``When you think how limited her life is, that's her only
contact to the outside world,'' said Ms. Small.
   Her dreams are simple: to get out of her bed, to go to school,
to see her classmates and the New Kids on the Block, to have
another party, to fly to Puerto Rico to visit her grandmother, to
see the clouds from the plane.
   ``I don't want to die, never, never,'' she cries. ``I want to
live.''

   Here is the text of the joint statement
issued by President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
Sunday at the close of their summit.
   ``With regard to Iraq's invasion and continued military
occupation of Kuwait, President Bush and President Gorbachev issue
the following joint statement:
   ``We are united in the belief that Iraq's aggression must not be
tolerated. No peaceful international order is possible if larger
states can devour their smaller neighbors.
   ``We reaffirm the joint statement of our foreign ministers of
Aug. 3, 1990, and our support for United Nations Security Council
Resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664 and 665.
   ``Today, we once again call upon the government of Iraq to
withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait, to allow the restoration of
Kuwait's legitimate government, and to free all hostages now held
in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``Nothing short of the complete implementation of the United
Nations Security Council resolutions is acceptable.
   ``Nothing short of a return to the pre-August 2 status of Kuwait
can end Iraq's isolation.
   ``We call upon the entire world community to adhere to the
sanctions mandated by the United Nations, and we pledge to work,
individually and in concert, to insure full compliance with the
sanctions. At the same time, the United States and the Soviet Union
recognize that U.N. Security Council Resolution 661 permits, in
humanitarian circumstances, the importation into Iraq and Kuwait of
food. The Sanctions Committee will make recommendations to the
Security Council on what would constitute humanitarian
circumstances. The United States and the Soviet Union further agree
that any such imports must be strictly monitored by the appropriate
international agencies to ensure that food reaches only those for
whom it is intended, with special priority being given to meeting
the needs of children.
   ``Our preference is to resolve the crisis peacefully, and we
will be united against Iraq's aggression as long as the crisis
exists. However, we are determined to see this aggression end, and
if the current steps fail to end it, we are prepared to consider
additional ones consistent with the U.N. charter. We must
demonstrate beyond any doubt that aggression cannot and will not
pay.
   ``As soon as the objectives mandated by the U.N. Security
Council resolutions mentioned above have been achieved, and we have
demonstrated that aggression does not pay, the presidents direct
their foreign ministers to work with countries in the region and
outside it to develop regional security structures and measures to
promote peace and stability. It is essential to work actively to
resolve all remaining conflicts in the Middle East and Persian
Gulf. Both sides will continue to consult each other and initiate
measures to pursue these broader objectives at the proper time.''

   Here is the transcript of the news
conference by President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev after their summit meeting Sunday.
   Bush: Well, I've been advised that I'm to take the first
question, and if so, I would identify Helen Thomas of the U.P.
   Q: I'd like to ask both presidents whether we are going to have
a war in the Persian Gulf, and I'd like to follow up.
   Bush: Well, with your permission, Mr. President, I hope that we
can achieve a peaceful solution, and the way to do that is to have
Iraq comply with the United Nations resolutions. And I think that
part of our joint statement, two short lines, said it most clearly:
``Nothing short of the complete implementation of United Nations
Security Council resolutions is acceptable.'' As soon as Saddam
Hussein realizes that, then there certainly will be a peaceful
resolution to this question.
   Q: How about President Gorbachev? What do you think?
   Gorbachev: In replying to your question, I should like to say
that the whole of our seven hours of meeting today were devoted to
the quest for a political resolution of that conflict. And I
believe that we're on the right road.
   Q: Mr. President _ if I may follow up with you, President Bush.
You are indicating that hostilities could break out if this is not
resolved peacefully.
   Bush: The question is what?
   Q: I said, you are indicating that there could be hostilities.
   Bush: The United States is determined to see these resolutions
enforced, and I like to feel that they will be enforced and that
that will result in a peaceful resolution.
   Q: My question to Mr. President _ my name is Panyi. Do you
think, Mr. President, that the conflict of the Gulf gives the
opportunity to solve the Palestinian problem through an
international peace conference for the Middle East? And my second
question is if this problem was discussed today with Mr. Gorbachev?
   Bush: Well, let me say that I see the implementation of the
United Nations resolutions separate and apart from the need to
solve the other question. That question has been on the agenda of
many countries for many years, and it is very important that that
question be resolved. The secretary of state said the other day,
and I strongly support that, that under certain circumstances the
consideration of a conference of that nature would be acceptable _
indeed, it's been a part of our policy from time to time. But the
thing that I feel strongly about is that these issues are not
linked. And any effort to link them is an effort to dilute the
resolutions of the United Nations.
   Q: A question to President Bush from Soviet Radio and
Television. How long will United States be _ troops be present in
the Persian Gulf area?
   Bush: They will be present in the area until we are satisfied
that the security needs of the area have been met, and that these
resolutions have been complied with. And the sooner they are out of
there, as far as I am concerned, the better. I made very clear to
President Gorbachev, as I think he will confirm, that we have no
intention keeping them a day longer than is required. And so, I'd
leave it right there.
   Q: Tom Raum with the Associated Press _
   Gorbachev: I'd like to add something, and to confirm what the
President of the United States has just said to me in our
conversation, that the United States of America do not intend to
leave their forces in the zone. And in connection with the change
or the normalization of the situation, the United States
administration, and personally the President, will do everything
possible to ensure that the forces are withdrawn from the region _
from the zone. And that's a very important statement.
   Q: I have a question for both Presidents. The unity that you're
expressing today doesn't ignore the fact that there are still some
irritants between the two countries. President Bush, are you more
sympathetic now to suggestions of Western economic aid to the
Soviet Union? And President Gorbachev, would you be willing to
withdraw Soviet military advisers from Iraq?
   Bush: For my part, I am very much interested in assisting to be
sure that perestroika is successful. We indeed have a mission of
high-level businessmen on their way to the Soviet Union right now.
They happen to be in Helsinki. This is but one manifestation of the
fact that we are trying to encourage economic cooperation in as
many ways as possible. And we had a good, long discussion in our
expanded meeting this afternoon about that. And I _ I am given the
_ the common stand that the Soviet Union and the United States have
taken at the United Nations. It seems to me that we should be as
forthcoming as we possibly can in terms of economics, and I plan to
do that.
   There are certain constraints, as you say, there are certain
nuances of difference. There are certain differences, real
differences. But on the other hand, I have said before and I'll
repeat it here in front of all this -- journalists from all around
the world, we, of course, want perestroika to succeed. It is an
internal matter of the Soviet Union, but I think this remarkable
cooperation that has been demonstrated by the Soviet Union at the
United Nations gets me inclined to recommend as close cooperation
in the economic field as possible, and I will be saying this to the
Congress when I get back.
   We still have problems. Look, we've got some big problems
ourselves in our economy, and we are not in the position, operating
at the enormous deficits, to write out large checks. Having said
that, there are many ways that we can endeavor to be of assistance
to the emerging economy in the Soviet Union.

   Gorbachev: And there was a question also addressed to me. I
would like, nevertheless, on the question which did appear also to
be addressed to me _ the Western assistance to the Soviet _ I would
like to continue. The conversation with President Bush is
continuing on the Western assistance to the Soviet Union. I see
that there is an attempt being made to establish a link between
this and disagreements or the lack of disagreements. And in
response to that, I would say the following.
   We began our conversation today together by reviewing the
situation and realizing that the whole of world society and our two
great states are undergoing a trial. This is a test of the
durability of the new approach to resolving world problems.
   And as we enter upon a new peaceful period and as we emerge from
the Cold War, we see that no less (inaudible) are necessary in
order to find ways and means in this period of peace to meet the
new situation and to tackle all problems that may arise.
   I think if it hadn't been for Malta, it would have been very
difficult for us to act in the very difficult situation which arose
in Eastern Europe _ in Europe, and in the situation connected with
the unification of Germany. I think that if, following that, there
hadn't been Washington and Camp David and the other meetings on
this level with other partners in international relations, we would
now be in a difficult situation facing the crisis in the Persian
Gulf.
   And the fact that today we have taken a common approach to such
difficult problems, problems which may well have tragic
consequences for the whole world, not just for the peoples of that
region, demonstrates that we still are moving forward in the right
direction and that we are capable of resolving the most difficult
and the most acute problems and to find appropriate responses to
the challenges of our time. And the greater part of our
conversation together was devoted to this.
   And I believe that this is the most important point to bear in
mind. Differences, nuances in the differences of view, arguments _
these can be _ these are natural. It's natural that those should
arise. But what we have seen today is that we have confirmed the
most important progress of recent time. Now I should like to say
something about the Iraqi question, but in fact, I haven't quite
finished on the first subject.
   I wouldn't want President Bush's reply to give rise to the
opinion that the Soviet Union is going to align with a certain
behavior. We are acting in a difficult situation. We are finding a
solution _ we shall find a solution which will be satisfactory and,
above all, which will remove the danger of an explosion.
   And this is becoming a normal element of the new kind of
cooperation in trade, in technology and human exchange. All of
these elements characterize the new peaceful period upon which we
are just now embarked and which we have to get used to.
   It would be very over-simplified and very superficial to judge
that the Soviet Union could be bought for dollars, because although
we do look forward to cooperation in this very serious time of
far-reaching changes in our economy, and that's normal, let's
remember the reforms of recent years. In a number of states, they
always, in addition to the principal efforts made by the peoples
concerned themselves, they always involved also the participation
of the world community in one form of another. So if anybody wants
to try to impose a different view, that's unacceptable to us. It's
unacceptable to the United States. It's unacceptable to the Soviet
Union, and it would be unacceptable to any other state.
   Now, to move on to the second part of your question concerning
our experts in Iraq. They are not so much advisers as specialists
or experts who are working under contract, and their number is
being reduced. Whereas at the beginning of the conflict, I think
there were still 196 of them; there are now some 150 of them. And
the Iraqi leadership looks upon the matter thus, that if they
haven't completed their work _ their normal work under contract,
even though it may be a matter of weapons, then they are,
nevertheless, leaving Iraq and the process is going forward. So I
don't really think there's a problem.
   Q: Izvestia. Question to both presidents. Did you discuss any
possible military options for curbing Iraqi aggression? And what
would be the conditions, and what would be the point where you
would consider that the political options were exhausted and it was
time to go to the Security Council and talk about _ through the
Security Council demanding an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait?
   Bush: The answer to your question is no. We did not discuss
military options. And your question is too hypothetical.
   And I would like to see this matter peacefully resolved.
   Gorbachev: I would like to support what was said by President
Bush, and I stress once more that the whole of our time together
was spent on talking about this conflict in a mutual search for a
political solution. And I think we can look with optimism in the
final analysis on the efforts being taken by the international
community working together within the Security Council at the U.N.

   Q: Mikhail Sergeyevich, you were just saying that if Iraq
doesn't withdraw its forces peacefully, then it will be necessary
to take military steps. What kind of Soviet contribution will there
be to those military steps? And what will happen then to the Soviet
citizens who are in Iraq now? And what will the Arab factor be?
   Gorbachev: Firstly, I did not say that if Iraq does not withdraw
peacefully, we're going to have recourse to military methods. I did
not state that. I do not state that. And moreover, in my view, that
would draw us into consequences which we can't at this stage
forecast and therefore, our country and the United Nations as a
whole has a whole range of possibilities of finding a political
solution to this problem. Therefore, I would limit ourselves to
that and therefore the second part of your question is irrelevant.
   Q: If I could ask President Gorbachev, specifically, Iraq had
been your ally. What directly have you done in contact with Saddam
Hussein to reverse the situation there? And President Bush, what
specifically have you asked Mr. Gorbachev to do directly? Have you
asked him to make a direct contact with Saddam Hussein?
   Gorbachev: I should say that from the start of the crisis, we've
been actively exchanging views and carrying forth dialogue not only
within the Security Council, not only with the administration of
the USA. These types of contact have great importance to us, but we
are also holding active dialogue with leadership of China, of
India, of all the other European states, especially those which are
members of the Security Council. And in my view, it's this dialogue
which has helped us towards the Security Council resolution which
was passed.
   On top of that, we are also actively cooperating with the Arab
states, the countries of the Arab World. And here our dialogue is
no less intensive than with our partners in the countries I
previously mentioned, including dialogue with President Hussein.
   And I can state that what we have announced publicly is also
being said to President Hussein in our dialogue with him which all
means that the President and the leadership of Iraq are expected to
show a reasonable approach to stop and to understand what is
implied by the position taken by the Security Council on this issue.
   This is the dialogue which we have undertaken with him. And we
are trying to make sure that our arguments are convincing. We
discussed various options for ending the situation with him and we
are also attempting, as I already said, to make it quite clear to
Saddam Hussein that if Iraq were to provoke military action, then
the result would be a tragedy first and foremost for the Iraqi
people themselves, for the whole of the region and for the whole of
the world.
   You know, this is, of course, a dialogue in a very difficult
situation. But we consider it a very useful dialogue and we don't
exclude the possibility of establishing new contacts, of having new
meetings at various levels. And the type of communication which we
have had up until now with the Iraqis gives us hope that those
links we have with them can be used positively for the sake of all
of us, for the sake of finding a peaceful solution to this problem,
and especially of preventing the situation turning into aggression,
in this situation.
   Bush: My _ (inaudible) _ would simply be that there is no need
to ask Mr. Gorbachev to contact Saddam Hussein. Clearly, from his
answer you can see that they have been in contact _
   Interpreter: The President cannot be heard. The microphone
   seems to be off.
   Bush: _ not working?
   Interpreter: The President could not be heard for a few
   seconds there. The microphone was off.
   Bush: Is that better? Well _
   Gorbachev: It's a little better, but hit it again.
   Bush: (Chuckles.) President Gorbachev answered the question
about the contact with Saddam Hussein. And clearly your question to
me is, have I asked him to contact Saddam Hussein? The answer is
no. But the Soviet Union is in contact. He himself received the
foreign minister, Aziz. But I would just simply sum it up by saying
the best answer to Saddam Hussein, or the best contact is the
contact that took place at the United Nations when there was
worldwide condemnation of the aggression.
   And I happen to feel that this statement showing the Soviet
Union and the United States in essential agreement here is another
good statement for Saddam Hussein. And hopefully he will see that
he is not going to divide us and divide other countries and that he
will do what he should have done some time ago, and that is, comply
with the United Nations sanctions. So _ but I did not ask him to do
that, because they're way ahead of us on that. They are having
contacts and trying to be helpful in that regard.
   Q: Pravda. I have a question to Mr. Bush. Mr. President, what is
your position on the question of signing a treaty limiting
strategic offensive weapons?
   And when do you think that such a treaty will in fact be signed?
   Bush: We still remain committed to a strategic arms treaty. We
vowed that we would encourage our negotiators to move forward more
rapidly on both the strategic arms treaty and the conventional
force agreement. And I'm still hopeful that by the end of the year
we will have such an agreement.
   Interpreter: Microphone please for Mr. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev: Should I hit it again? I think it's working. I'd like
to confirm what President Bush has just said, that we really have
agreed to make fresh efforts to give further instructions, because
we see that there is a possibility successfully to complete the
negotiating process in those two fora and to come up with positive
results in the course of this year.

   Q: Good evening, Doris Akatarian from Palestine News Agency,
WAFA. My question is for President Bush, and I would also like to
hear President Gorbachev's comments on that. President Bush
mentioned that you failed to see the link between the Palestinian
question and the present situation. I would like to know how come
it is so important to implement U.N. resolutions in this particular
instance when other standing ones have been frozen and overlooked
and disregarded for so long? So, I'd like to know how come this
aggression is so different from other ones; and I would also like
to add that I personally feel that the Palestinian dilemma and
question need the attention of the superpowers more than ever.
Thank you very much.
   Bush: I agree that it needs it, and we are very much interested
in implementing Resolution 242 of the United Nations. We've been
zealously trying to do that as have many other powers for many
years. But the fact that that resolution hasn't been fulfilled when
it calls for withdrawal to secure and recognized boundaries, and it
should be, and hopefully we can be catalytic in seeing that happen,
does not mean that you sit idly by in the face of a naked
aggression against Kuwait.
   And the United Nations has moved, and the United Nations'
resolutions should be implemented on their face without trying to
tie it into some other unresolved dispute. But I couldn't agree
more that it is important, it is very important that that question
eventually, and hopefully sooner than later, be resolved.
   Gorbachev: I think that everything that is taking place in the
Middle East is a matter of concern to us, of equal concern. And
even more than in the case of the Persian Gulf, we need to act more
energetically in order to resolve the complex of problems in the
Middle East, and to come up with decisions and to devise a system,
to devise guarantees that would ensure the interests of all peoples
and of the whole world community, because it's a matter which is of
vital concern to all of us. And it seems to me that there is a link
here because the failure to find a solution in the Middle East at
large also has a bearing on the acuteness of the particular
conflict we've been talking about here.
   Q: A question for both presidents, please. In your statement,
you pledged to work individually and in concert to ensure full
compliance with the UN sanctions against Iraq. May I inquire what,
if any, specific and concrete steps you have agreed to take in
furtherance of that?
   Bush: We didn't agree to specific and concrete steps. I think
President Gorbachev in the contacts he's had with Saddam Hussein,
and if _ I mean, with the Iraqis _ and if they continue, will be a
step in that direction. Clearly, this message itself will be a step
in that direction. But we did not sit at this meeting and try to
assign each other or ask each other to undertake specific measures
in keeping with that particular paragraph.
   Gorbachev: I'd like to add to that that the emphasis here is on
the significance of the political fact that we feel necessary to
reflect in this statement, which testifies to our political will to
act jointly, or in parallel _ independently really _ in search of
these new steps towards a peaceful resolution of the problem. I
think that for the meeting and the document that we've just adopted
is more important than our enumerating various steps that might
have been taken here. That forms the basis for the further active
quest for solutions.
   Q: Soviet Tass Agency. I also have a question to the presidents
of both countries. Mr. President _ Mr. Gorbachev first of all.
Since the last meeting, it seems to be that you've had a good
mutual understanding. Have you succeeded in deepening that mutual
understanding in the course of today's meeting and how, in general,
what bearing in general is that factor having on the results of
your negotiations?
   Bush: Well, I think clearly there has been a developing mutual
understanding over the years. I like to feel, and I think President
Gorbachev agrees, that our meeting in Malta had something to do
with furthering that understanding. I'm convinced that our meeting
in the United States at Camp David particularly furthered that
understanding. But I'm not _ I think the world sees clearly that if
this had occurred 20 years ago, there wouldn't have been this
cooperative feeling at the United Nations. And I think it's very
important.
   So I don't know how one quantifies mutual understanding, but I
feel we're moving on the right track. Neither of us when we talk
try to hide our differences. Neither of us try to indicate that we
look at exactly every problem exactly the same way. But the very
fact we can talk with that degree of frankness, without rancor, I
think, enhances mutual understanding.

<HEAD>HELSINKI: mutual understanding.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   And then when we see us on a question of this nature, standing
shoulder to shoulder with many other countries at the United
Nations, I think it is obvious manifestation of this developing
mutual understanding. It's a very broad philosophical question, but
differences still remain. But the common ground, in my view, at
least, surges ahead of these differences. And we will continue to
cooperate with President Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev: I don't know if I would be allowed to tell you a
secret here. I haven't asked President Bush if he'll let me. But I
must admit that I'm dying to take the risk and tell you, but it's
too important to give you an answer to this particular question.
But that last sentence does really give me the hope that we'll get
by. In our talks, the President said, ``You know, there was a long
time when our view was that the Soviet Union had nothing to do in
the Middle East. There was _ had no business being there.'' This
was something that we had to talk through during this meeting here
in Helsinki, and what was said here is that it's very important for
us to cooperate in the Middle East, just as it is on other issues
of world politics. So that is an answer to your question.
   It is very important that at each meeting we move forward. We
enrich our relationship, and I think I should say that we increase
our trust. If trust is engendered between the leaders of two such
nations during meetings of this kind, then I'm sure you'll agree
with me that that is to the good of all of us. Whether we want it
or not, history dictates that a lot is going to depend on whether
the two countries can work together. That's not our ambition; it's
just the way that history has gone.
   So far from excluding such a possibility, we intend to cooperate
with all sorts of other countries as well, more and more. That's
how we see our role in the world developing.
   And my last comment is also very important. It seems to me that
the way the world is, the way the world is changing, in today's
world, no single country, however powerful, will be able to provide
the leadership which individual countries formerly tried to
provide, including some countries which are represented here. We
can only succeed if we work together and solve our problems
together. That is what is emerging from these negotiations, and
that we consider the most important aspect.
   Q: Mikhail Sergeyevich, from French television _ I'm going to
speak French if I may. Could I ask Mr. Gorbachev whether the Soviet
Union is still Iraq's friend as Minister Tariq Aziz declared in
Moscow last week? Are you still the friend of Saddam Hussein?
   And another question, also directed to Mr. Gorbachev: President
Saddam Hussein stated yesterday that the Soviet Union would
demonstrate that it is a great power by resisting George Bush's
pressure and by supporting the Baghdad regime. Could you indicate
to me, if you would, what your reply would be to Saddam Hussein?
   Gorbachev: I will reply to you, and so I don't have to repeat it
also to Saddam Hussein, the same reply that I've given to previous
questions. My position is unchanged. We see our role and our
responsibility, and within the framework of that responsibility we
shall act in cooperation with the other members of the Security
Council. And in this instance, I can once again say, since we are
sitting here, two presidents together, I shall interact and
cooperate with the President of the United States. I'd very much
like to express the hope that President Saddam Hussein will display
_ I really hope that he will _ will display sobriety, will look
carefully at the whole situation and will respond to the appeals
and the demands of the world community and that he will take steps
that are suitable to the situation, that are carefully weighed in
their worldwide implications and in their implications for the Arab
world too.
   No one has any intention of trying to exclude Iraq from the
community of nations, but what the present Iraqi leadership is
doing is driving into a dead end, and I hope that President Saddam
Hussein will heed this appeal to him.
   Q: I'd like to ask Mr. Gorbachev if you have ruled out the
possibility of a Soviet military participation in this effort in
any sense, either as part of the naval blockade or as part of some
future peacekeeping force in the region?
   And I would follow up with a question to Mr. Bush _ to what
degree that would be a disappointment to you if _ if that's Mr.
Gorbachev's position?
   Gorbachev: I don't see the point of doing that now, and we shall
continue to act in cooperation within the Security Council and in
strict compliance with all of its decisions.

<TEXT>
   Bush: I'm not disappointed in that answer. (Laughter.)
   Q: You said you're determined to see this aggression end, and
current steps are being considered. What does this mean? What comes
next?
   Bush: It's too hypothetical. We want to see the message get
through to Saddam Hussein. We want to see him do what the United
Nations calls on him to do. And that statement can be interpreted
any way you want to interpret it, but it's out there and I would
simply not go into any hypothetical questions that would lead me
beyond what that statement says.
   Gorbachev: Please, if you would excuse me, I'll add a couple of
words _ just to what Mr. Bush has already said.
   You know, in my view, I have the impression that both the press
and public opinion in some countries is in some ways saying that
there's a lack of decision on somebody's part, that we're
withdrawing in the face of those who are trampling on international
law. I cannot agree with that view. In fact, it's a view which
causes a certain amount of embarrassment to the leadership of
nations which are acting through the Security Council in this
respect.
   What has been done up till now in answer to Iraqi aggression is
very important because action has been taken not only within the
framework of the Security Council, but there has been unanimous
world opinion _ a kind of solidarity which has never been expressed
before in the history of the world. And we have prevented the
aggression going any further. We have preserved the functioning of
the structures which are of economic importance, which would affect
so many other countries as well. And finally, the resolution has
been taken on an embargo, which is a very stiff measure, in
reaction to the aggression.
   In my view, this is a strategic way of tackling the question,
which has been tackled successfully at the first stages. And we are
convinced that the next stage of a political solution, achieved
politically, to put an end to this acute international crisis and
make sure that a political settlement should be possible, that in
this situation decisiveness, willpower and responsibility and
political faith in the possibility of a political solution to this
very difficult issue shows that the political leaders of the world
are being responsible to their own nations and to the world. And we
do not want to get caught up in arguments about prestige and so on.
   Q: From the Finnish Television. Concerning the humanitarian aid,
does your joint statement mean in practice that you consider that
food should be now allowed to Iraq?
   Gorbachev: The presidents feel it necessary to reflect in our
joint declaration that we see the need to uphold what was decided
by the Security Council on this subject and the Security Council
was prepared to admit for humanitarian purposes the supply of
medicines and of foodstuffs required first and foremost for
children. We've actually stated this quite plainly in our
statement. And so we've taken a very clear-cut position on that.
But we've also made it clear this must take place within the
framework of certain international organizations and being
monitored by them at stages in the operation. So I think that this
has been stated in the correct terms.
   Bush: (Off mike) ... President Gorbachev on that point, and that
the language is very good because it does express the concern that
both countries feel in the event there actually are children and
others who are suffering because of lack of food.
   I hope that nobody around the world interprets this as our view
that now there should be wholesale food shipments to Iraq because I
can speak only here for the United States when I would call
attention to the fact that we need some kind of international
agencies to see that there is this humanitarian concern as
expressed, this exception in the United Nations embargo for
humanitarian purposes, and not only is it required for this
humanitarian circumstance, but that the food gets where it is
supposed to go.
   So this should not be from the U.S. standpoint interpreted as a
wholesale big hole in this embargo. It was not our intention and I
think the language is very clear on that point.
   Q: A few things if you could clear up for us. First of all, you
seem to disagree on the military option. And when you talk about
further steps being taken to implement the U.N. sanctions,
President Bush, you seem to be saying the military option is still
out there. President Gorbachev seems to disagree. Do you disagree
on that? Did you ask President Gorbachev to pull his experts out of
Iraq and did you ask him to send troops into the Gulf region?
   Bush: I did not ask him to send troops in. If the Soviets
decided to do that at the invitation of the Saudis, that would be
fine with us. But I did not ask him to do that. I believe there _
with the 23 countries that are participating on the ground or _ 23
countries that are participating on the ground and at sea that the
security of Saudi Arabia is close to safeguarded. What were the
other two points?

<HEAD>Humanitarian Aid to Iraq Seen Leading to Sanctions Violations</HEAD>

   Permitting humanitarian shipments of food to
Iraq and Kuwait may open the door to broader violations of a U.N.
trade embargo, but the leakage is likely to be small, U.S. analysts
and officials say.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed
at their Helsinki summit Sunday to allow food shipments to Iraq and
occupied Kuwait ``in humanitarian circumstances.''
   They said the United Nations, whose Security Council voted Aug.
6 to embargo all trade with Iraq because it had invaded Kuwait four
days earlier, would define the special circumstances. Shipments
would be monitored by international agencies.
   Bush, apparently worried that Sunday's announcement would be
seen as a weakening of U.S. resolve against Iraq, said, ``I hope
that nobody around the world interprets this as our view that now
there should be wholesale food shipments to Iraq.''
   He is banking on the embargo to force Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait.
   Bush previously had refused to publicly endorse humanitarian aid
to Iraq, although other nations have sought to force his hand on
this issue. China and Iran said in recent days that they were
willing to help arrange emergency shipments of food and medicine.
   Saddam in recent public statements has accused the president of
trying to starve Iraqi children and vowed that foreigners being
held in Iraq and Kuwait would share in any deprivations caused by
the U.N. sanctions.
   In Washington, initial reaction suggested Bush's move in
Helsinki would be seen as a concession, even though the U.N.
resolution specifically says that medical supplies, and ``in
humanitarian circumstances'' food, would be exempt from the embargo.
   ``That's a little crack in the embargo,'' Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, said on ABC-TV's ``This Week
With David Brinkley.''
   Private U.S. analysts said allowing certain food and medical
supplies into Iraq and Kuwait was likely to invite more widespread
cheating on the trade embargo.
   ``It obviously will be an excuse for a little bit more
leakage,'' said Judith Kipper, a Middle East scholar at the
Brookings Institution in Washington. She added, however, that
``it's the lack of cash and spare parts for machinery'' that are
more important in determining whether Saddam backs off.
   James A. Phillips, deputy director of foreign policy studies at
the Heritage Foundation, said cutting off Iraq's oil income by
prohibiting petroleum exports is the key to ensuring that Saddam is
unable to buy his way around the sanctions.
   ``Iraq would have a difficult time paying for enough food or
other supplies to improve appreciably its ability to hold out
against the embargo,'' Phillips said.
   In a joint statement issued at the close of their meeting, Bush
and Gorbachev said they were united in seeking to enforce the U.N.
embargo and pressure Saddam to withdraw from Kuwait and release all
foreign hostages.
   ``At the same time, the United States and the Soviet Union
recognize that U.N. Security Council Resolution 661 permits, in
humanitarian circumstances, the importation into Iraq and Kuwait of
food,'' the statement said.
   The two leaders said a U.N. committee would advise the Security
Council on what would constitute humanitarian circumstances. They
said any food shipments should be monitored by unspecified
international agencies ``to ensure that food reaches only those for
whom it is intended, with special priority being given to meeting
the needs of children.''
   It was not immediately clear which international organizations
might be involved.
   In Washington, a Red Cross official said that organization would
not help monitor humanitarian shipments until Iraq allows Red Cross
officials to meet with civilians there.
   Ann Stingle, a spokeswoman, said the International Committee of
the Red Cross last week was denied permission by Iraq to provide
assistance to several groups, including Western hostages,
non-Westerners authorized to leave Iraq but not able to do so,
Iraqi and Kuwaiti civilians and Kuwaiti prisoners of war.
   ``Until we have access we would not be able to'' participate in
a U.N.-sponsored humanitarian aid effort, Mrs. Stingle said.

<HEAD>HELSINKI: two points?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Did you ask him to pull the experts out of Iraq and do you
disagree on the use of military force? You seem to say it's still
an option; he seems to say it's not an option _ ever.
   Bush: We may have a difference on that. I'm just _ as I think
I've answered over and over again at home _ I'm not going to
discuss what I will or won't do. And President Gorbachev made an
eloquent appeal, with which I agree, that a peaceful solution is
the best. So I've left it open. He can comment on the other. But I
_ and again, John, I'm sorry _ the second point?
   Q: The experts, pulling the experts out?
   Bush: Well, I think it would facilitate things, but on the other
hand, he's given his answer here. And that is not a major irritant.
You've said that he's already _ I think he said that he is reducing
the numbers there, but I think I tried to make clear that this was
a question that was widely being raised in the United States, and
it would facilitate things if they were out of there in terms of
total understanding. But I heard his answer, listened to it very,
very carefully, and I must say that I would let it stand at that.
If I was just saying, ``Would I like to see them all out of
there?'' I think I'd say absolutely. But I'd let him add to that.
   Gorbachev: In answer to all these questions which you gave us
such a clear list of, I've already given answers. I really don't
have anything to add to the answers I've already given.
   Q: Al Ahram newspaper of Cairo, Egypt. Question to the two
presidents, please. You mentioned something about the security
arrangement. Is the Soviet Union going to participate in any kind
of security arrangement, and what is the role of the region and the
countries of that region of the Middle East?
   Gorbachev: On the first question, as we began, we intend to
continue to cooperate closely and actively in the framework of the
Security Council and on the basis of the decisions that have been
adopted, we shall act accordingly. That's the first point.
   Secondly, as concerns the role of the countries of the region,
yes, I think that generally speaking I would stress the importance
of the Arab factor, not yet really hadn't been brought to bear in
efforts to help resolve this crisis situation.
   I don't want to offer you our analysis right now as to why
that's the case, but nevertheless I am convinced that there is an
obvious activization of the quest on the part of Arab states to
find the response to the urgent situation which faces us _ faces us
all here. We cooperate with all the Arab countries and I might say
not unusefully. The outlines of possible steps are beginning to
emerge but it is too soon to be specific. We are continuing our
cooperation with Arab countries and at a certain stage, when the
situation has changed and has been somewhat _ when the tension has
been reduced, then perhaps we might carry this further.
   But we shall continue in the Security Council _ the permanent
members of the Security Council _ to guarantee security. I have no
doubt that we shall succeed in resolving the problem by political
means.
   Bush: May I comment on that one, please? I am very glad that the
Arab states, at the Arab League and in other ways, have stated
their condemnation of Saddam Hussein. He is trying to make this a
contest between the Arab world and the United States.
   And it is no such thing if you will look at how the United
Nations has overwhelming condemned him.
   So the Arab states have a very key role in this. Many Arab
states have responded in the defense of Saudi Arabia: Syria,
Morocco, Egypt, to say nothing of the GCC countries. So it is not
Saddam Hussein and the Arab world against the United States. It is
Saddam Hussein against the United Nations and against a majority of
the Arab League. And that is a very important point that I will
continue to make because the Arab League itself has stood up to him
and urged his compliance with the sanctions and condemned his
aggression.
   So in this case I see the Arab states as having a very important
role to play in the resolution of this question, and they have not
been taken in by his attempt to make this the Arab world versus the
United States of America, when it is nothing of the kind.
   Gorbachev: I wanted the President and myself to conclude this
press conference by expressing our deep sympathies and feelings for
the people of Finland, for the hospitality extended to us on this
soil, and to appreciate highly the contribution made by the
president of this country and his wife to have made these excellent
arrangements for this meeting.
   Bush: May I simply add that President Koivisto and Mrs. Koivisto
have been most hospitable and I agree with this. We owe them a
great debt of gratitude and the people of Finland. Thank you.

   No one likes the sergeant.
   Who could? It's his voice, always in your ear, like the Georgia
gnats that are in constant orbit around your head.
   The voice runs you sometimes from 5 in the morning to midnight.
Whenever you think you've caught a break and stretch out on your
bunk, here it comes again, dragging you out of a sweaty sleep.
   ``Damn! What's going on? You don't need to be laying down!''
Sgt. 1st Class Ronnie Jackson's shout comes through the barracks
screen door like a rocket. ``Get up! We got things to do!''
   The short, stocky commander of the 265th Quartermaster
Detachment has been haranguing his men since they were mobilized
for deployment to the Mideast two weeks ago. It's his job to
prepare the South Carolina National Guard water purification unit
for the hot and potentially hostile desert.
   The task is hard, and not just because of the crowded training
schedule or the exhausting heat the guardsmen face each day. It is
also complicated by personal histories. Jackson, a 40-year-old
probation officer and high school sports referee, has known nearly
all 14 of the unit's men for years.
   On the street, back in their hometown of Allendale, S.C., he's
just plain Ronnie waving hello to Henry or Earnie or Hullie. But
when the uniforms come on, he becomes Sgt. Jackson giving orders to
Spc. Harris and Sgts. Deloach and Cohen.
   Jackson has been the boss since 1982. He has been a member of
the unit for 17 years, a year less than three men he now orders
around.
   ``It took some getting used to, but it had to be done,'' said
Jackson. ``It's like refereeing basketball. When you walk on the
floor, you've got to take charge.''
   Jackson is in constant motion, going from planning meeting to
planning meeting wearing his combat equipment and carrying a
briefcase. A good percentage of his comments begin with, ``Damn
it!''
   He is, of course, a constant target for the men. Any mistake is
immediately and loudly corrected. When the 40-year-old Jackson runs
with the men in the morning, many tease him about his endurance.
   ``Can you feel it, Sarge? Can you feel it?'' asks 23-year-old
Ulysses Calhoun, spinning effortlessly in place as Jackson
determinedly keeps up with the pace.
   The men snicker when Jackson has to stand on a box to use a
computerized firing range. But the sergeant quickly squeezes off
round after round of hits. He makes sure all the men are aware of
his prowess.
   One evening Jackson joined the rest of the unit at the post's
gym for a game of basketball. The opposing side played a hard,
unrelenting game. They argued with Jackson over nearly every point.
When they won, they were exultant.
   But the sergeant knows when to back off.
   After spending an afternoon in the hot sun, the tired and
frustrated men seemed ready for mutiny, except they were too tired.
To make matters worse, the schedule called for an evening of
exhausting chemical warfare training.
   The sergeant stayed clear of the men, who were allowed to train
at first aid and navigation instead.
   ``You've got to know when to give them some room,'' he said.
   Jackson clearly likes the mantle of authority. Active for years
in the precinct's Democratic Party, he hopes to run for office when
he returns home, maybe for probate judge, maybe for state
representative.
   He also hopes to move up in the Guard. He was set to go to first
sergeant school before the unit was mobilized. Ultimately, he hopes
to become a sergeant major.
   ``Everybody respects you in that job,'' he said. ``I think I
deserve that.''

<HEAD>Public School Religious Classes Stir Debate in A Catholic Land</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public schools have begun teaching
religion in this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country, prompting
concern about the continued separation of church and state in
post-Communist Poland.
   In the term that began this month, the Catholic religion is
being taught two hours a week from kindergarten through high
school, replacing the former system of church-run catechism schools.
   Attendance is optional and some other religions also are
arranging classes, but the government's decision has left many
people uneasy. Non-Catholics express fears their children will
singled out and harassed by others because of their different
beliefs.
   ``Intolerance is one thing we fear,'' said Zdzislaw Slowinski, a
Wroclaw Polytechnic scientist. ``Second, as we experienced before
the war, the church will impose its doctrines on the overall
educational system.''
   Slowinski, who has four children, is rallying like-minded
parents against the classes. He rejects organized religion, and
said his children already encounter hostility because they do not
participate in church ceremonies.
   Newspaper letter columns have been filled with arguments for and
against the classes.
   Most people who telephoned two call-in radio shows on the first
day of school opposed them. Some complained that parishioners paid
to build church classrooms that will be unused because of the shift
to public schools.
   The Catholic church made religion in the public schools one of
its main goals after the Communists fell from power last year.
   Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the conservative head of the Polish
church, has vigorously defended the religion classes and his
priests promote them in their weekly homilies.
   Addressing 400,000 faithful on Aug. 15 at the Jasna Gora
monastery in Czestochowa, Glemp blamed the old regime for current
doubts about teaching religion in the schools.
   ``In its struggle against religion, the Communist system managed
to reduce it in the minds of many people to the rank of a private
matter,'' the cardinal said. ``In reality, religion is not a
private matter. Faith requires a community.''
   The Rev. Henryk Jankowski, pastor of St. Brygida's Church in
Gdansk, said in a recent interview: ``Should religious instruction
in schools be restored? The answer is definite. Schools are the
property of the nation. The Polish nation is over 90 percent
Catholic.''
   Jankowski's church is near the shipyard where Solidarity was
born in 1980, and became an unofficial headquarters of the union
movement during the years it was banned.
   An Education Ministry regulation providing for the classes,
issued Aug. 2, was drafted by a joint commission of the church and
the Solidarity-led government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki,
a former Catholic journalist.
   Priests, nuns and lay teachers appointed by local bishops
arrived at schools on opening day, Sept. 3.
   School principals and many other Poles were caught by surprise.
   There was no parliamentary debate and Education Ministry
officials previously had spoken against religion classes. Room
assignments and class schedules had been completed, so school
officials scrambled to find space and time for the extra sessions.
   Jacek Ambroziak, a government minister and co-chairman of the
joint commission, noted that the classes were voluntary and
declared: ``The instruction does not impose anything on anyone or
restrict anyone's freedom of beliefs,''
   A commission statement urged ``tolerance and respect for people
following a different philosophy.''
   About 36 million of Poland's 38 million people identify
themselves as Roman Catholic. The next largest group is Eastern
Orthodox, with about 1 million adherents concentrated in the
eastern provinces.
   Among many smaller religious minorities are Lutherans,
Evangelicals, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-Day Adventists, Mormons,
Jews and even Moslems, descended from Tatar invaders of the Middle
Ages.
   Opposition comes from severql quarters.
   Freedom and Peace, a pacifist-ecological group oriented to the
young, has urged high school students to boycott the classes.
   Government ombudsman Ewa Letowska asked the Constitutional
Tribunal, the highest court for constitutional questions, to
determine whether the religion classes are legal without
legislation. Her appeal is based in part on a 1961 law requiring
schools to be non-religious in character.
   A survey by state television in late August indicated Poles
preferred the system of church schools by a margin of 59 percent to
39. It involved 900 people nationwide, with a 3 percent margin of
error.
   At the kindergarten and elementary level, parents decide whether
their children will attend the classes. In high school, either the
student or parents can make the decision.
   Prayer is permitted at the beginning of the school day in the
presence of all children, including non-believers. Lay religious
teachers will be paid by the schools, but not members of the clergy.
   Leading non-Catholic denominations endorsed the classes, after
some hesitation. Orthodox and Protestant classes are being
organized, drawing pupils from several schools when necessary.
   The Catholic church argues that religion classes are merely a
return to the situation before the Communists. Religion was taught
in schools until the early 1950s, when the Communists felt strong
enough to clamp down on the church and imprisoned Cardinal Stefan
Wyszynski for three years.
   After hard-line Stalinists were ousted in 1956, religion
returned to the schools briefly until the education law of 1961.
The church then established its catechism schools, which met after
regular school or on weekends.
   Attendance at the church classes was nearly universal among
Catholics. Sending one's child was both an expression of faith and
a patriotic defiance of the Communists.

<HEAD>1988 Drought Effects Not as Bad as Feared</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years ago, it looked as if a vast part of
the nation's farm empire was burning up as drought and heat parched
crops and livestock.
   But the 1988 drought wasn't as bad as it might have been,
according to an Agriculture Department analysis. Crop yields
plummeted, but commodity prices rose. For those who eked out some
production, or had grain stored from previous years, it wasn't too
bad.
   The latest postmortem of the 1988 drought's effects was written
by Gerald W. Whittaker of the department's Economic Research
Service. It concentrated on the most severe drought region,
centered in nine states of the Midwest and upper Great Plains.
   All of the information used in the study was from USDA's annual
Farm Costs and Returns Survey, which includes detailed income and
expense information derived from personal interviews of farm
operators.
   Basic findings:
   _Net farm income decreased in 1988 in the drought region to an
average of $28,899 per farm from $38,122 in 1987. Income in
non-drought areas rose to $62,822 in 1988 from $50,967 in 1987.
   As used by the agency, net farm income includes gross income
from farming during the calendar year, including federal payments,
minus costs of production. It also includes allowances for changes
in the value of inventories and adjustments for depreciation and
other factors.
   _Despite drought, farms in all areas of the country continued to
improve their solvency position in 1988.
   _The number of farms considered financially vulnerable continued
to decrease in 1988 in both the drought and non-drought regions.
   _Farms in the drought region received lower direct government
payments in 1988, despite an infusion of federal disaster relief.
   _The average farm in the drought region survived financially by
selling off inventories and taking advantage of higher commodity
market prices to redeem price support loans made by USDA's
Commodity Credit Corp.
   No state-by-state breakdowns were included in the report. The
nine states studied as the ``drought region'' were Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South
Dakota and Wisconsin.
   In the category of net farm income, the report said the share of
farms in a ``favorable financial position'' in 1988 held fairly
steady at 68 percent in the non-drought region, compared with 69.1
percent in 1987.
   In the drought states, 62.2 percent of the farms were said to be
in favorable financial position, compared with 62.8 percent in 1987.
   ``Even with lower incomes, farmers in the drought region
continued to improve their debt position (in relation to assets),''
the report said. ``A major factor in their improvement was the
continued upward trend in land values.''
   The report noted that higher market prices helped reduce the
direct payments to farmers in 1988 under USDA's commodity programs.
Nationally, those payments dropped to $9.8 billion from $11.5
billion in 1987.
   But Congress also provided nearly $3.9 billion in emergency
drought aid to farmers in 1988. The nine states in the study
collected about $2.57 billion, or two-thirds of the total.

   Hunters and others returning to the United
States from Mexico with animal trophies might run into some
obstacles at the border.
   The Agriculture Department says inspectors are on guard against
items that can carry Boophilus ticks into the United States.
   ``This tick, which carries bovine babesiosis _ a serious cattle
disease often called Texas cattle fever _ was eradicated from the
United States in 1943,'' said James W. Glosser, administrator of
the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
   Strict measures are being taken to prevent the reintroduction of
the tick, he said.
   For example, animal carcasses with hides attached are not
eligible for importation into the United States. Hides that have
been tanned or soaked in a saltwater solution with mineral acid,
and dry antlers can be imported from Mexico without restriction,
provided they are certified to be of Mexican origin.
   Glosser said raw and untreated hides and antlers may qualify if
they are certified by the Mexican government to have been treated
for ticks. Alternately, they may be dipped at one of several
Mexican cattle export facilities along the border.

   The Agriculture Department is using tiny wheat
fields of one square foot each to monitor the spread of leaf and
stem rust in the Southeast. Results have been mixed.
   John Roberts, a scientist in the department's Agricultural
Research Service, said the tiny plots are planted in July about 20
miles apart along an interstate highway route through Georgia,
Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, then looping back into
Georgia.
   The pilot study was begun in 1986. That was a drought year in
the region, and so was 1987. Then in 1988, some of the wheat plots
on low ground near the Gulf Coast drowned out.
   Highway maintenance crews sometimes mow down the wheat, along
with the weeds, Roberts said. And deer and rabbits sometimes munch
on the plants.
   But Roberts, who works at the agency's research facility at
Griffin, Ga., said the small test plots show real promise as a
survey method.

   The Soviet Union has condemned the invasion of
Kuwait, but Soviet weapons and military experts helped make it
possible and many of the experts are still in Iraq.
   On Sunday, President Bush raised the issue of the experts with
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their summit in Helsinki. There
had been speculation the Soviet leader might agree to pull them out
quickly.
   He didn't. But he did say at a news conference that their
numbers had been reduced, from 193 to about 150, and that they
would continue to leave as their contracts expire.
   ``They are leaving Iraq and the process is moving forward, so I
don't think it's a problem,'' he said.
   Soviet officials have denied the experts played any direct role
in planning or executing the Aug. 2 invasion. But Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady Gerasimov has acknowledged a ``moral problem'' in
the military cooperation with Iraq.
   ``Our military experts were in Iraq to show how to deal with
Soviet military equipment, which was sold to Iraq for defensive
purposes,'' Gerasimov said Thursday.
   ``This military technology was used not for defensive purposes,
which gave way to this moral problem _ that is to say, we helped
the aggressor.''
   Throughout the past decade, including the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war,
Moscow was Iraq's main weapons supplier. It sold Baghdad more than
$13 billion worth of T-72 tanks; Scud and SAM missiles; MiG-29,
MiG-25 and Sukhoi fighters; helicopters; artillery; Kalashnikov
rifles, small arms and ammunition, according to the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute in Sweden.
   Technical experts _ certainly numbering in the hundreds, and
possibly in the thousands _ were sent to teach Iraq's army how to
use and maintain the sophisticated weapons.
   Today, the bulk of Iraq's arms are still Soviet, said Hans
Binnendijk, a weapons analyst at the International Institute for
Strategic Studies in London.
   Of Iraq's 5,500 tanks, all but about 30 are Soviet. Of its 500
planes, nearly 80 percent are Soviet, although the Iraqi air force
also has about 100 French Mirages. Of its surface-to-air missiles,
about 300 are Soviet; the remainder are 60 French-made Rolands,
Binnendijk said.
   After the invasion of Kuwait, the Kremlin abruptly shut down the
arms pipeline.
   So why has Moscow balked at yanking out the technical experts?
   Soviet officials say they are bound to honor their contracts
with Baghdad. But Western diplomats and analysts say the Soviets
have ample legal grounds to cancel the contracts, since Iraq
violated the terms by using the weapons for offensive purposes.
   Money could be a factor, but probably not a decisive one. The
Soviet Union already has shown it is willing to forgo hundreds of
millions of dollars in trade with Iraq to comply with a U.N.
embargo.
   Some Western observers suggested the Kremlin may view the
experts as a way to retain influence with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
   ``Pulling out the experts would be closing another door to
influence over the situation there, and it might also anger certain
conservatives in the Soviet military who feel Gorbachev has already
caved into the United States and made too many one-way
concessions,'' Mark Von Hagen, a specialist on the Soviet military,
said Sunday by telephone from Columbia University in New York.
   A senior Western military analyst in Moscow said he was
``somewhat skeptical'' of the Soviet claim that there were just 193
military experts left in Iraq at the time of the invasion.
   The analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the figure
could be in the thousands. He added that the discrepancy between
Soviet and Western figures could be partly a matter of definition,
with the Soviets choosing to count some advisers as civilians even
though they work on military-related equipment or construction
projects.
   The newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya reported Aug. 26 that about
7,000 Soviet civilian experts and their dependents were in Iraq,
most working on six large construction projects: a 1,680-megawatt
power plant, two oil fields, a 40,000-ton grain elevator, a
hydroelectric plant on the Euphrates River, and an irrigation
collector.
   Soviet officials say Moscow has stopped sending civilian experts
and has evacuated nearly 1,000 women and children on special
Aeroflot flights.
   Some Soviet newspaper columnists have urged the government to go
further and sever its longstanding ties with Saddam.
   ``In my view, there are every grounds to say that the (1972
Soviet-Iraqi Friendship) Treaty has been violated by Iraq, and its
continued existence ... does not increase our international
prestige,'' wrote Yuri Kornilov, a Tass commentator.
   He added other voices have been raised against continued
Soviet-Iraqi cooperation, but ``it seems they are not heard in the
tall building on Smolensk Square'' _ the Foreign Ministry
headquarters.

<HEAD>US Troubled By Continuing Sandinista Links to Salvadoran Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than four months after Nicaragua's
leftist government surrendered power, the State Department is
expressing concern over evidence of continuing military transfers
from Sandinista partisans to rebels in El Salvador.
   The latest sign was the recent discovery by Honduran authorities
of a shipment of weapons and documents aboard a Volkswagen minibus
alleged to be headed for El Salvador.
   The vehicle, intercepted near the Nicaraguan border, had a
hidden compartment containing explosive charges for mortar rounds,
pamphlets, false identification documents, training booklets and
blueprints of garrisons of the Salvadoran armed forces, Honduran
officials said. The driver was a French woman who lived in Mexico.
   The seizure on Aug. 27 followed the arrest a month earlier in
Nicaragua of two Salvadoran guerrillas with a truckload of weapons.
   In their final weeks in office, the Sandinistas granted
Nicaraguan citizenship to several hundred Salvadorans, many of whom
have been members of the FMLN rebel group for years and used
Nicaragua as a base of operations.
   The Sandinistas, defeated in February elections, turned power
over to President Violeta Chamorro in April. But as part of her
policy of national reconciliation, they have been allowed to
maintain effective control of the army and police.
   Her most significant gesture to the Sandinistas was to permit
Humberto Ortega, brother of former President Daniel Ortega, to
remain as head of the armed forces.
   Sandinista links with their rebel allies in El Salvador was the
overriding reason the Reagan administration offered military
backing to the Contra insurgents in Nicaragua during much of the
1980s.
   ``We are disturbed that Nicaraguan territory continues to be
used to provide military support to the FMLN,'' the State
Department said last week. It added that the shipment discovered in
Honduras was a ``blatant'' violation of the 1987 Central American
agreement which, among other provisions, forbids cross-border
weapons shipments to rebel groups.
   The department said it expects the United Nations agency that
monitors compliance with that agreement to investigate the matter
vigorously.
   ``We also expect that the government of Nicaragua will take
whatever measures are necessary to stop this pattern of activity,
which the Sandinistas have conducted for years,'' it said.
   The department is likely to cite the continuing links between
the Sandinistas and the Salvadoran rebels to reinforce its
contention that the Salvadoran armed forces need continued U.S.
support.
   Congressional Democrats have been lobbying hard for sharp cuts,
arguing that to do otherwise would only prolong the 10-year war
between the Salvadoran government and the rebels. Several rounds of
peace talks have been held in recent months and a new round is to
begin shortly.

<TEXT>
   Congress reconvenes this week in a changed,
more complicated and _ for its members _ a politically friendlier
world than the one it left at the start of the summer recess.
   Although Iraq invaded Kuwait a few days before the break began,
the extent of the U.S. military operation and the long-term nature
of the commitment wasn't apparent. Now that the troops have dug in
and the issue has sunk in, Congress is in its wartime mode.
   While the prospect of war threatens the lives of American
soldiers, it's life insurance for politicians. President Bush got a
jump in the polls by ordering the biggest military deployment since
Vietnam and incumbents in Congress also gained.
   Dozens of lawmakers from both chambers broke into their August
vacations to make sure they were seen visiting U.S. troops in the
Saudi Arabian desert. Vulnerable incumbents whose membership in the
Armed Services Committee or Foreign Affairs Committee seemed
irrelevant a few weeks ago used the opportunity to raise their
statesmanship quotient in front of the voters.
   That's just one reason Congress loves a military crisis, even if
members later turn against the war if it becomes unpopular.
   The current atmosphere is not just prevalent among Congress'
traditional hawks.
   Democrats of all stripes are praising Bush at every turn. In
part, at least, it is a shield to deflect criticism of themselves
by Republicans as somehow unpatriotic at a time when national unity
is demanded.
   And with the Middle East getting overriding public attention,
it's especially hard for Republicans to spell out their differences
with the Democrats who control Congress.
   Unfortunately, tough issues like taxes, clean air, the budget,
farm subsidies, campaign reform and the savings and loan scandal
remain unresolved and this Congress could be tagged a loser unless
it deals with most of them.
   The 101st Congress, which convened in January 1989, has left
most of its work for its final scheduled month. Lawmakers almost
surely will be kept in Washington past the scheduled Oct. 5
adjournment date, and there is widespread talk of a post-election
session.
   The cost of the Iraq standoff, both in $1 billion-a-month
military spending and higher oil prices, complicates not only the
budget but issues like the pending clean air bill and maybe even
the farm bill currently in final drafting. Farmers are heavy users
of petroleum products.
   It even has affected the debate over Bush's Supreme Court
nominee, David Souter, who faces Senate hearings later this week.
Opponents of the appointment had hoped to make their case to the
public during the August recess but they were drowned out.
   Still to be seen is whether the Mideast news will submerge other
issues through the election and become a viable excuse to the
voters for what so far has been a lackluster legislative
performance.
   Or will voters turn their attention elsewhere, to concerns like
the weakening economy or abortion or even the congressional pay
raise?

<HEAD>Aboard The Flying Sentry: `A Wake Up Call From Iraq'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OVER SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jay Cooper is rapping his fingers on
his surveillance console and glancing at a photograph of his wife
and daughters when the message comes from the mission crew
commander of the U.S. AWACS plane.
   ``We've finally got a wakeup call from Iraq,'' says the
commander, and the crew springs into action, tracking the blip that
suddenly appears on radar consoles showing Iraqi air space.
   Cooper is a surveillance specialist on one of several U.S. AWACS
planes involved in Operation Desert Shield. The planes and their
30-member crews keep a close eye on Iraqi air activity and serve as
traffic cops for the busy military patrols of American and Saudi
jets.
   Shortly after the blip appears, Cooper says, ``We've got him.''
Within minutes, the crew determines the plane is a large transport.
They track it until it lands, but this incident is routine.
   Soon the screens again show blank Iraqi and Kuwaiti air space.
   Ninety minutes later the voice calling the men into action is
more urgent _ the radar now shows an Iraqi fighter streaking toward
the Saudi border.
   ``It's a fast fighter, coming our way,'' Cooper says,
dispatching a radar technician to wake Kevin Lewis, another
surveillance officer who is napping.
   The jet accelerates to 1600 mph before suddenly disappearing
from the screen.
   ``We lost him,'' says Lewis. ``I don't know what happened. He
must have turned and screwed out of there.''
   This would prove the most dramatic incident during a more than
15-hour mission Saturday night and Sunday morning.
   The $180 million AWACS plane _ a converted Boeing 707 formally
known as the E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System _ is perhaps
the most important element of the U.S. Air Force presence in Saudi
Arabia.
   Its fuselage-mounted radar disc can `see' for more than 250
miles, picking up targets flying low or high. Several of the Iraqi
aircraft tracked Saturday night and early Sunday were helicopters.
   For now, the AWACS is playing defense, directing round-the-clock
patrols by American and Saudi jets over Saudi Arabia and the
Persian Gulf.
   But should war break out, the AWACS will shift to offense, using
its unrivaled view of the skies to direct friendly forces in combat.
   The AWACS would be essential not only because of its tracking
abilities but also because many fighter jets in northern Saudi
Arabia would be out of communication range of the U.S. ground
headquarters.
   ``We can use AWACS as an offensive or defensive mission,'' said
Col. Tom Bliss, commander of the U.S. AWACS fleet deployed in Saudi
Arabia. ``We're jacks of all trades.''
   During the overnight mission, each time air traffic was spotted
over Iraq and Kuwait the data was fed by AWACS weapons officers to
friendly aircraft, Navy ships, ground control posts and Patriot
ground-to-air missile batteries.
   It is often boring yet grueling duty, with hours on end spent
staring at the radar consoles, often jammed with green markers
showing friendly aircraft, red markers showing hostile airbases and
yellow markers that signify unknown aircraft.
   Of late, there have been nights when hours pass without any
Iraqi air activity. Saturday was one of those, with a handful of
spottings of fighter planes, cargo planes and helicopters.
   Sleep is at a premium during the slow hours. Some men slept face
down on their consoles, others got one of the coveted cots or just
found a spot on the flat, hard floor.
   The AWACS generally flies only with fighters in the area to
protect it, but still is extremely vulnerable to attack. Pilots say
they have little choice but to put their faith in their
surveillance and weapons crews and the nearby fighters.
   One of the more challenging _ and harrowing _ experiences for
AWACS pilots is in-flight refueling.
   The giant 707 has to be brought underneath and within 15 feet of
a KC-135 tanker, which drops a boom that initially appears as if it
will smash through the cockpit windshield but then catches a fuel
receptacle.
   During one refueling Sunday, the connection was lost twice,
forcing the pilot to repeatedly chase down the tanker and reconnect.
   After receiving thousands of pounds of jet fuel, the AWACS heads
back into its planned surveillance pattern for the rest of its
mission.
   The commanders face a formidable task in trying to keep the men
alert for the second half of the mission.
   ``We don't assume for a minute that war couldn't start,
tonight,'' said Bliss. ``So we have to keep them ready at all
times.''
   An exhausted Staff Sgt. Mike Rose celebrated his 43rd birthday
late Saturday in an AWACS high over Saudi Arabia.
   ``It gets so routine sometimes you have to pump yourself for
each mission,'' said Rose. ``But when it gets dull you just think
of the guys on the ground and on the ships and remember we've got
to give them as early a warning as possible.''

   Barbara Bush and Raisa Gorbachev
reached over the crowd of Finnish women, clasping outstretched
fingers and straining to understand shouts of good will.
   ``Good, good Barbara,'' one woman called in Finnish from the
back of the crowd that gathered before the two first ladies Sunday.
   ``Where are you?'' said Mrs. Bush, peering over a jumble of
faces.
   ``Looking nice, Raisa,'' said another woman, interrupting Mrs.
Gorbachev's attempts to make a formal statement through her
interpreter. She reached up and held the hand of the speaker.
   It was the only joint public appearance the two women made
during the brief summit of their husbands, President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   At the suggestion of Mrs. Gorbachev, an academic researcher,
they paged through antique books at the Helsinki University
Library. It holds one of the best collections of Slavic literature
in the West.
   They were surrounded by picture-snapping well-wishers outside
the library and pressed by reporters inside for predictions on the
chances for peace.
   ``Yes, there is a peaceful solution'' to the Persian Gulf
crisis, Mrs. Bush said. ``Otherwise we wouldn't be here.''
   ``I hope our husbands, along with the rest of the free world,
will work hard to make peace,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   Mrs. Gorbachev said, ``As people, as citizens of our
countries,'' the first ladies wanted ``a political, peaceful
solution to be found.''
   Asked whether she was worried about American soldiers sent to
Saudi Arabia, Mrs. Bush said: ``Of course we worry about the men
and the women. We worry.''
   Mrs. Bush wore a royal blue dress and pearls, then changed to a
blue jacket over red dress for the flight home.
   Mrs. Gorbachev wore a severe gray suit and a violet blouse
during the day, appearing less stylish than she has on previous
visits to the West. Mrs. Gorbachev has drawn criticism in the
Soviet Union for her fashionable attire and has made fewer public
appearances lately.
   The first ladies, along with Tellervo Koivisto, wife of the
Finnish president, examined ancient books, manuscripts and maps,
including the oldest known Moscow city map and an early American
map showing California as an island.
   Librarian Esko Hakli escorted the women through the domed,
neoclassical library, pointing out the rarest of its 3 million
books and 2 million other documents.
   Mrs. Gorbachev, a former university professor, repeatedly
prodded him for historical tidbits as they strolled past stacks of
books.
   She urged Mrs. Bush to prepare for a visit to Moscow by studying
the 1538 map. But Hakli told reporters that it shows only the
Moscow River and a few other details ``and you wouldn't find your
way with the help of that map.''

   When the dust settled in this Nordic
capital, Mikhail Gorbachev and George Bush remained pretty much
where they were before on the Persian Gulf crisis _ pledged to
political and commercial means to secure Iraq's withdrawal from
Kuwait.
   Bush repeated his pledge to withdraw U.S. troops from Saudi
Arabia when the Gulf crisis ends and to provide economic assistance
to bolster Soviet reforms.
   Gorbachev repeated that he did not plan to send warships or
troops to assist the U.S.-led effort to enforce United Nations
sanctions against Iraq.
   Acknowledging ``nuances'' and ``differences'' on some issues,
the two men were grinning as they left for home. Bush nodded
vigorously as Gorbachev said ``we have confirmed the most important
progress of recent times,'' a sharp reduction of tension between
the world's two most powerful states.
   But Bush feigned horror when Gorbachev told a joint news
conference he wanted to ``tell you a secret here.''
   ``I haven't asked President Bush if he'll let me, but I'm dying
to take the risk and tell you,'' Gorbachev said. He changed the
subject as Bush shook his head.
   Pending disclosure of their summit secret, the two leaders could
look forward to further cooperation in the Gulf crisis, and as many
as three possible further meetings this year: one to sign a
conventional arms control agreement at a European summit in
November; another when and if they conclude work a treaty to slash
strategic arsenals by up to half.
   They might also attend a ceremony in Berlin on Oct. 3 reuniting
the two Germanys, although neither has said he would go.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III later said ``there's
optimism that we will conclude a conventional forces treaty'' for
the Conference on Security and Cooperation In Europe to be attended
by leaders of 35 nations in Paris in November.
   Baker said they would sign a strategic arms treaty at ``the next
summit meeting between these two presidents to be held in Moscow at
some time as yet undetermined.''
   Gorbachev spent much of the news conference rebuffing
suggestions that he was following the U.S. lead in the Gulf crisis
to secure economic aid.
   ``It would be very oversimplified and very superficial to judge
that the Soviet Union could be bought for dollars,'' he said.
   Gorbachev was asked to respond to Iraq leader Saddam Hussein's
challenge for Moscow to defy U.S. will in the Middle East to prove
that it was still a superpower.
   ``We do not want to get caught up in a debate about prestige,''
the Soviet leader responded.
   ``No single country, however powerful, will be able to provide
the leadership which individual countries formerly tried to
provide, including some countries which are represented here,''
Gorbachev said.
   Bush did not spell out concrete steps he might take to prop up
the failing economy of the Soviet Union, where shortages of bread
and other staples were spreading. But he said he wanted to bolster
radical reforms in the Soviet Union.
   ``We, of course, want perestroika to succeed,'' Bush said. ``I
think that this remarkable cooperation that has been demonstrated
by the Soviet Union at the United Nations gets me inclined to
recommend as close cooperation in the economic field as possible,
and I will be saying this to the Congress when I get back.''
   Bush and Senate leaders say they will push for ratification of a
bilateral trade agreement and favorable tariffs for the Soviet
Union once that nation's parliament codifies recent liberalizations
in emigration policy.
   The president also noted that he was sending Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher to Moscow this week with a team of U.S. business
executives to ``encourage economic cooperation in as many ways as
possible.''
   White House chief of staff John Sununu told reporters that the
two leaders discussed cooperation in developing energy resources.
But he did not go as far as Bush did Saturday when the president
said he might be willing to trade U.S. technology for Soviet oil.
The Soviet Union is the world's largest oil producer.

   The economic and military
embargoes in place against Iraq could topple Saddam Hussein,
perhaps in two months, say congressmen returning from recess trips
to the Middle East.
   ``The officials we spoke with all felt that he had been weakened
by the long, costly Iran-Iraq war, the subsequent settlement with
Iran ... and his miscalculation in invading Kuwait,'' said Rep.
John Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee.
   Murtha and nine other lawmakers returned Sunday from visits with
Saudi Arabian King Fahd, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, some
exiled Kuwaiti officials, and U.S. military commanders and troops
in the field during their five-day trip.
   The consensus among the rulers they met with was that Saddam,
the Iraqi ruler, would remain in power for two more months, Murtha
said.
   ``In that part of the world, the insinuations were there are
other methods of removing dictators from their positions of power,
other than caving in,'' said Murtha, who would not elaborate.
   Murtha, whose subcommittee oversees military spending, said he
could not estimate how much the U.S. deployment in the gulf will
cost.
   He also said that military equipment was working surprisingly
well in the hot, sandy Saudi desert.
   ``You can't see 25 or 30 yards in front of you,'' Murtha said of
the dusty conditions at the front lines. ``Equipment has to be
maintained constantly. They sleep in the sand beside their
equipment. Yet even with those difficulties, morale is very high.''
   The congressman that he and his colleagues wore military
uniforms one day to test their comfort and found them acceptable.
   He did say, however, that a lot of sand penetrated the boots and
that officials have discussed sending different ones to the troops.

<HEAD>Israel Wins Ruling Stopping Publication of Book on Mossad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publisher of a book about the Israeli secret
service says Israel has won a court order barring the book from
being released and the author from discussing it.
   The order bans ``By Way of Deception,'' written by Ottawa
journalist Claire Hoy and Victor Ostrovsky, a former case officer
with the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence unit.
   The 300-page book, which was to be released in October, involves
Ostrovsky's experiences with the Mossad, said Angel Guerra, a
spokesman for Stoddart Publishing Co.
   The order barring publication or discussion of the book was
obtained Friday in the general division of the Ontario Court, said
Guerra and Larry Enfield, a lawyer for the Canadian publisher.
   The court said Ostrovsky had signed agreements stating he
wouldn't release information obtained from his work as a Mossad
agent.
   Ostrovsky, an Israeli native, has lived in Ottawa for three
years, where he works as a graphic artist, Guerra said. He began
working as a Mossad case officer in the early 1980s but later left
the service, Guerra said.

<TEXT>
   Food, water and a trip home are the
main concerns of Asian evacuees from Iraq and Kuwait, but they say
they've also been victimized by profiteers, Jordanian soldiers and
callous officials.
   One complaining Indian in the scorching Ruweishid refugee camp
thrust a long handwritten letter into a reporter's hands with the
plea: ``Please publish this _ let the world know how they treat
us.''
   P.P. Abdulrahman of Peringadi, India, said Indian diplomats and
other officials ``are showing cruel discrimination, favoritism and
are receiving bribes'' in picking people for repatriation.
   His letter said officials have ignored deserving cases of
pregnant women and aged people ``in an inhuman and cruel way,'' in
their selection of people for repatriation.
   He added that Jordanian soldiers in the camps ``are behaving
inhumanly and several Indians have been severely beaten.''
   Other evacuees also complained about soldiers molesting women,
and providing them with extra food and water in return for sexual
favors.
   The reports could not be confirmed.
   One prevalent complaint was that profiteers are selling bottled
drinking water in the camp for $3 instead of the usual price of 30
cents. A packet of 20 local cigarettes was fetching $7.50 compared
to the usual price of 75 cents.
   Evacuees said Jordanian money changers come into the camp at
night, evading the guards who bar them by day. They buy Kuwaiti
dinars in exchange for Iraqi dinars at a rate of 2-1 or 1-1,
compared to 8-1 before the invasion.
   The Iraqi dinar _ although frozen on world currency markets _ is
the quasi-official currency of the camp.
   The vast majority of evacuees are penniless laborers who say
they fled Kuwait with little more than the loincloths or saris they
are wearing.
   ``There's no embassy representative here. He came one day, then
left and never came back,'' said one Indian man who would not give
his name but said he had lived in Kuwait for 30 years and had been
a senior government official there.
   Other Indians said an Indian diplomat was stoned and forced to
leave the camp last week because people complained he was showing
favoritism in picking people for repatriation.
   India said it had for a time stopped sending diplomatic
officials to the camp because of ``security'' concerns.
   More than 110,000 mostly impoverished men, women and children
from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand
and other Third World nations have been stuck in Jordan since
fleeing Kuwait and Iraq.

   The sounds of people on the move echoed through
the cavernous halls of Ellis Island again as the gateway through
which 12 million immigrants passed into the land of opportunity
reopened as a museum.
   Six years and $156 million after work began on the biggest
restoration project in U.S. history, the 90-year-old brick building
was dedicated Sunday as the Ellis Island Immigration Museum and
turned over to the National Park Service.
   ``What we celebrate in Ellis Island is nothing less than the
triumph of the American spirit,'' said Vice President Dan Quayle,
who snipped a white ribbon to open the museum at what was once
America's busiest port of entry.
   ``We may all know in our minds that time and time again, it has
been the immigrant who has renewed and rekindled the American
spirit. But here in Ellis Island, we feel it in our hearts.''
   An audience of about 2,500 invited guests gathered outside the
huge, four-towered immigration building, which was renovated
entirely with private contributions to a foundation that also
repaired the Statue of Liberty nearby.
   After the ceremony, people poured inside the building, once
again filling the vast Registry Room with sound.
   Forty-nine new citizens were sworn in by Supreme Court Justice
Antonin Scalia, and six people who entered the nation through Ellis
Island in the first quarter of the century were singled out to
represent the 12 million immigrants who passed through from 1892
until 1954.
   They included Johanna Flaherty, 84, who said she left Ireland in
1923 because she ``didn't want to wake up and stare a cow in the
face every morning.''
   Another was Clara Larsen, who came from Russia in 1913 because
she wanted an education. ``In Russia, the Jewish kids didn't stand
a chance,'' she recalled. ``They didn't accept them in the public
schools.'' She went on to become an early leader of the
International Ladies Garment Workers Union.
   Contributions by Americans of immigrant stock were celebrated
throughout the program, down to the music; the Army band played
selections by George Gershwin, Scott Joplin and Irving Berlin, who
came through Ellis Island as a child.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca, who spearheaded the fund-raising
effort, unveiled the American Immigrant Wall of Honor. It bears the
names of about 200,000 immigrants whose descendants donated $100 or
more to the renovation.
   ``There are thousands of different names, thousands of different
stories, but you stitch all of them together and you have one huge
saga, and it's our saga,'' he said.
   One of the names belonged to Antonio Macchiarola, 80, of
Johnston, R.I., who arrived at age 11. ``I was just a little bit of
a kid and I had to go through these lines to be examined,'' he
said. ``Everybody was afraid they wouldn't make it.''
   Macchiarola did, like 98 percent of those who landed at Ellis
Island. But for those who were turned back _ including a little
girl who traveled with his family and was rejected because of eye
disease _ Ellis Island was called the Isle of Tears.
   Among the exhibits is one consisting of objects brought to the
New World by immigrants. Items ranged from the exotic, such as a
formal Aragonese dress fan from end-of-the-century Spain, to
passports and other travel documents, china, christening bonnets,
linens and a teddy bear.
   Oral histories help fill in the picture. The mother of Michael
Dukakis, for instance, recalls coming here not because of hunger or
war but because women in her native Greece could not go to college.
   Ellis Island was the gateway to the New World for the ancestors
of two out of five Americans. Between 1892 and 1924, an average of
5,000 people a day passed through. On the busiest day _ April 17,
1907 _ 11,747 immigrants were processed.
   The U.S. government opened the first immigration station on the
island in 1892, but the building burned down five years later.
   Its replacement was finished in 1900, a building designed to
impress immigrants with its ornate copper domes, vast windows and
vaulted ceilings.

   When Pvt. Michael Durnell began
basic Army training, the Persian Gulf was a faraway chapter from
geography lessons and Iraq hadn't invaded Kuwait.
   Eight weeks later, Durnell and his buddies say they can handle
fighting in the Gulf _ or whatever the Army hands them.
   ``Nobody looks forward to going into a possible war situation,
but I'm definitely ready to do the job,'' said Durnell, 21, of
Kansas City, Mo.
   He was among 560 new soldiers, all in their teens or early 20s,
who graduated last Thursday from basic training at Fort Leonard
Wood. The 64,000-acre post in the Ozarks has prepared soldiers for
a half-century.
   At seven other Army posts across the nation, Army recruits have
the same regimen _ up at 4:30 a.m., in bed by 8 p.m., six days a
week.
   Don Moore of Atlanta watched with other parents during the
graduation ceremony as the teen-agers turned young men marched with
heads held high and chests puffed out.
   ``I'd hate to lose him, but you take an oath to protect your
country. We have to protect ourselves. Freedom is not free,'' Moore
said.
   The prospect of war in the Middle East was not emphasized during
training. All recruits face months of specialized training before
getting their first assignment.
   But Lt. Col. Stephen Rasmussen, commander of the graduating
battalion, acknowledged the Persian Gulf crisis in his speech. ``If
I could ask an Iraqi general what these men have done, he would say
they've worried him a lot,'' he said.
   Army officials here say they won't change training to suit the
desert. That training includes three weeks of weapons training, 80
miles of marching, and millions of push-ups.
   Capt. Mike Presnell watched as 150 of his recruits crawled,
dodged and ran along a 400-yard tactical training course in
100-degree heat.
   ``My job is to prepare soldiers to serve in any type of combat,
to graduate combat-ready soldiers,'' said Presnell.
   Behind him, recruits in full combat gear trained to stay alive
with a sensor device on the helmet and chest. The device is
activated by an infrared beam fired by someone in hiding. The beam
sets off a beep to denote a kill.
   ``They love this. They like testing their skills. You provide
them exciting training and they'll be motivated,'' Presnell said.
``It's better they learn their lessons here when it's only a beep.''
   Gone are days of filling the ranks with high-school dropouts and
those in trouble with the law back home. Now, if you don't have a
high school diploma, forget it.
   ``The soldier of today is a hell of a lot better than the
soldier of 14 years ago. We're getting better men to begin with,''
said Maj. Harold Von Fischer-Benzon, a brigade training officer.
The failure rate in basic training is about 5 percent, he said.
   Gone, too, are the screaming, shouting drill sergeants training
by fear and intimidation.
   ``Profanity is out. Harassment is out. It's a modern Army. They
volunteered to come in. You don't need vulgar language anymore,''
said Staff Sgt. Gregory Wolf.

   The Iron Curtain has come down, but not
the wall around Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
   The changes in the Soviet Union have brought publication of
Solzhenitsyn's long-banned books and an offer to restore
citizenship to the exiled writer.
   But the Nobel laureate and chief chronicler of 20th century
Russian history remains in his Vermont compound deep in the woods
off a dirt road, his home surrounded by a fence with a TV monitor
at the gate.
   What has emanated from behind the fence in recent months has
been mostly silence. Only two brief statements have broken the
quiet, with Solzhenitsyn's characteristic anger and sarcasm.
   A Soviet official was quoted by the Tass news agency Aug. 16 as
saying the 71-year-old Solzhenitsyn had held high-level talks with
Soviet officials about restoring his citizenship.
   The response from the writer's wife, Natalia, who frequently
speaks for him: ``This is a lie.''
   Until Soviet authorities formally lift their charge of high
treason against her husband and admit they were wrong to expel him
in 1974, ``there can be no discussion about the reinstatement of
citizenship,'' Mrs. Solzhenitsyn said.
   In late August, Solzhenitsyn indicated he was preparing to speak
out at length. He wrote to the Soviet newspaper Komsomolskaya
Pravda that he had completed an article containing his views on
current Soviet affairs and the ``potential as well as necessary
measures that need to be taken.''
   But in what appeared to be an indication of his doubts about
Soviet changes, Solzhenitsyn sarcastically referred to past
official excuses about paper shortages preventing widespread
publication of his works:
   ``One only has to wonder whether there will be enough paper in
the U.S.S.R. to facilitate an inexpensive and mass publication of
this brochure.''
   Michael Scammell, Solzhenitsyn's biographer and former
translator, said that until the article appears, those wondering
about Solzhenitsyn's desires for his homeland have to rely on his
``Letter to the Leaders,'' written in 1973.
   In that letter, Solzhenitsyn said the Russian Orthodox Church
should be allowed to function freely; the Communist Party should
give up its monopoly on power; censorship should be abolished; the
republics should be given the option of independence, and a strong
authoritarian leader should head the government but also allow
strong debate within society.
   Scammell said the Soviet Union in recent years had moved ``well
past 50 percent'' toward meeting those goals. The Russian Orthodox
patriarch was shown on Soviet television last Christmas; Christmas
and Easter may become official holidays again.
   Rifts within the Communist Party have created power sharing,
Scammell added. Solzhenitsyn's ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' his
devastating critique of Communist repression, has been published,
and ``The Red Wheel,'' a series of historical works about the
Russian Revolution, is being serialized in literary magazines.
   Scammell said it's difficult to know whether the changes are
good enough for Solzhenitsyn.
   ``He's a romantic through and through,'' Scammell said.
Solzhenitsyn heard family stories in his youth about life before
the revolution, and Czarist Russia ``came to be somewhat idealized
in his mind,'' Scammell said.
   Unless he has had a major change of heart, Solzhenitsyn's dream
for Russia is not modeled on Western-style democracy. The author
lashed out at the West as too legalistic and materialistic in a
commencement address at Harvard in 1978.
   Scammell said Solzhenitsyn probably would like his Russian
Orthodox faith to become almost ``an established part of the
state.''
   Solzhenitsyn's terms for change in his homeland might contain
room for compromise. But his terms for his own return do not.
   He wrote to Komsomolskaya Pravda that ``it would be
inconceivable for me to be a guest or a tourist in my own homeland
... to return and then leave. When I do return home, it will be to
live and die there.''

   More than 300 weary U.S. evacuees,
including a man who hid in an air-conditioning duct for a week and
escaped Iraq by posing as a deaf-mute Arab, got a hero's welcome
after a 21-hour flight from Jordan.
   Cheering well-wishers met the evacuees Sunday evening with
yellow ribbons, yellow carnations, teddy bears and American flags.
   ``I was lucky enough and smart enough to get away,'' said Jimmy
Hawkins, an oil engineer from Dallas who worked in Kuwait and hid
in a ceiling duct after the Iraqi invasion. ``Americans can't go
out. No way. If you don't have Arab friends, you're stuck.''
   The 305 evacuees _ more than half of them children _ arrived at
Charleston Airport aboard a chartered jet from Amman, Jordan.
   The Boeing 747, which left Amman early Sunday, was delayed
several hours because of an unexpected stop in Halifax, Nova
Scotia, to let off several people for health reasons, Mike Brennan
of the State Department said.
   One woman was suffering chest pains and three children from
another family were feeling ill. All four, plus the children's
mother, got off in Halifax. The sick were taken to a hospital.
   British Airways said 163 more Americans arrived Sunday in London
from Iraq, part of a British contingent of evacuees. The Americans
were scheduled to leave for Baltimore this afternoon after spending
the night in a hotel at Gatwick Airport.
   Most of the evacuees who arrived here had left Kuwait earlier in
the week. Some had hidden from Iraqi soldiers after the Aug. 2
invasion. They told harrowing stories of narrow escapes.
   Hawkins said he hid for a week in the ceiling after Iraqi troops
occupied his apartment building. He said he was brought food and
water by a Jordanian friend.
   Realizing they would eventually be caught by the Iraqis, they
set out Tuesday in Hawkins' car but were arrested in Basra, Iraq.
They spent two days in jail before bribing their way out from
behind bars, Hawkins said.
   ``We went and caught a ride with an Iraqi Army lieutenant and
sergeant to Baghdad,'' Hawkins said in Dallas, after flying in from
Charleston. ``They took us on, never had an idea I was an American.
   ``I was in the back seat the whole way,'' he said. ``I was
dressed as an Arab, playing deaf and dumb.''
   Hawkins said he crossed into Jordan after walking about six
miles through the desert.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell, wearing a yellow ribbon, and a crowd of
more than 100 well-wishers met the evacuees, who sang ``God Bless
America'' as their plane touched down.
   Cheers rang out as mothers, their children clutching teddy bear
gifts, entered the airport terminal. One small boy in the crowd
held up a sign with the TV character Bart Simpson. The sign read,
``Welcome Home Dudes.''
   ``The American government has just taken care of us like we were
ambassadors,'' said Pat Nicholson of Boise, Idaho.
   ``Every place we've gone the American people have been so ...,''
she said as she fought back tears and a bystander put a flag in her
hand. ``I'm just so glad to be home.''
   Sandra Williams of Warren, Ohio, her voice choked with emotion,
said, ``We were invaded, but it's not over. Most of the husbands
and fathers are still there. Most of the women had three, four or
five kids and they did a hell of a job.''

   Share prices soared Monday on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, ending the day with the market's sixth largest single-day
gain. The dollar edged lower.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average posted 1,118.83 points, or
4.67 percent, closing at 25,080.90. The market's main barometer
rose 150.16 points on Friday.
   The dollar closed at 139.43 yen, down 0.82 yen from Friday's
140.25-yen finish, after ranging between 139.33 yen and 139.65 yen.
Monday's close was the lowest since Oct. 2, 1989, when the currency
closed at 139.30 yen.
   Stock traders said the Nikkei rose sharply beginning in the
early morning as investors made index-linked large-scale purchases
in a positive reaction to the weekend summit meeting between
President Bush and his Soviet counterpart, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The two leaders joined Sunday in an extraordinary condemnation
of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and said they agreed that
``aggression cannot and will not pay.''
   ``Share prices jumped as soon as the market opened today, and
the surge in the spot market prompted rises in the futures also,''
said Kazuo Horikoshi, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co.
   The stock market, which has been reacting tensely to
developments in the Persian Gulf since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug.
2, slid for four straight days last week and hit its lowest trading
level of the year before Friday's recovery.
   On the currency exchange, dealers said the dollar's slide was
due to widespread pessimism about the U.S. economy.
   ``Because the gulf situation is prolonged and is still going
nowhere, investors' concern is now focused more on a slowdown in
the U.S. economy,'' said Masato Hayashi, a customer dealer with the
Bank of Tokyo.
   He said investors are actively selling the dollar aiming at the
138.50-yen level, on expectations of possible relaxation of U.S.
monetary policy.
   ``But the question is how far the yen, which has no specific
factor to keep attracting investors, can remain stronger against
the dollar as well as the major European currencies,'' Hayashi
added.

<TEXT>
   Cooper Union is the best buy in higher
education, practically paying students for the right to attend the
private college.
   So says a survey by Money magazine in its annual list of
colleges offering ``the best education for the buck.''
   The top three schools _ Cooper Union, the California Institute
of Technology and Rice University _ were all private. The rest of
the top 10 were public universities.
   Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, a highly
selective college in Manhattan founded by real estate magnate Peter
Cooper 131 years ago, provides a $15,000-a-year subsidy to each of
its 1,000 students from its $100 million endowment and
contributions. Students pay only a $300 activities fee.
   ``We're thrilled and delighted and honored,'' said Jay Iselin,
president of Cooper Union. ``The truth is that Cooper Union has
always believed that education should be available to anyone of
talent regardless of their means.''
   ``The MONEY Guide to the Best Colleges in America'' went on sale
at newsstands today.
   The publication, produced in collaboration with Peterson's
Guides, lists 100 public and 100 private schools that emerged as
best values based on a computer analysis that weighed tuition
against 17 measures of academic performance.
   The list excluded all two-year colleges and narrowly specialized
or sectarian schools. It also omitted the three military academies,
which are free and provide excellent education but require at least
five years' military service, ``thereby masking their actual
cost,'' according to the guide.
   Public universities were judged on the basis of out-of-state
tuitions, and private colleges were judged at their full price
exclusive of any scholarships or financial aid.
   Besides Cooper Union, the top 10 were, in order:
   _ California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif., ranked
high despite its $13,495 price tag. The school has a teaching
faculty of 274 for its 799 undergraduates, and faculty and students
have won 21 Nobel Prizes;
   _ Rice University in Houston uses its $1 billion endowment to
keep tuitions at a low $7,160 while maintaining an academic
reputation rivaling the Ivy League schools;
   _ The New College of the University of South Florida in Sarasota
combines the small feel of a private school with a public college
price: $5,488 for out-of-staters, $1,515 for Floridians;
   _ State University of New York at Geneseo, a strong liberal arts
branch of the 64-campus SUNY system, charges out-of-staters $4,925,
New Yorkers $1,575;
   _ State University of New York at Binghamton, a highly
competitive ``public Ivy,'' features Harpur College, where liberal
arts reigns. It costs $4,914 for out-of-state students, $1,564 for
in-staters;
   _ Trenton State College in Trenton, N.J., offers a strong core
curriculum for liberal arts students, at a cost of $3,795 for
out-of-staters, $2,720 for New Jersey students;
   _ State University of New York at Albany, with strong programs
in public administration, criminal justice and other
government-related careers, costs $4,835 for out-of-state students,
$1,485 for New Yorkers;
   _ University of Virginia, long considered one of the top state
universities with particularly excellent English and economics
departments, charges Virginians $2,966 and out-of-staters $8,136;
   _ University of Florida, which boasts 114 majors in 52
disciplines, charges $4,630 for out-of-state students, $1,320 for
Florida residents.

<HEAD>British Women Weep After Leaving Men Behind</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British women arriving home from Kuwait and Iraq
wept as they told of having to leave fathers and husbands behind to
an uncertain fate.
   Briton Suzanne Turvey, 18, said she was persistently questioned
by Iraqi forces in Kuwait until she told them where her father, oil
company worker John Turvey, was hiding.
   She said her father was taken to Baghdad and she does not know
where he is now. Miss Turvey had been on vacation, staying with her
father, who worked in Kuwait for eight years.
   ``I was interrogated by the Iraqi soldiers and eventually I had
to tell them where he was.'' Otherwise, she added, ``they said I
wasn't going to be going anywhere. ''
   ``My poor husband is still there,'' said Bhavna Trivedi, 32.
``The last time I saw him was 10 days ago. He is in Kuwait hiding.''
   She held her baby son, Adarsh, after arriving at Gatwick Airport
late Sunday on a British government-chartered Iraqi Airways flight
from Baghdad with more than 400 other women and children.
   ``He cannot go out to buy food,'' Mrs. Trivedi said of her
husband. ``Friends are looking after him. There is a warning that
if you are found harboring British citizens you will be hanged for
treason. I am scared.''
   ``Everyone is tense,'' she added. ``There is a lot of
resistance. They are trying to blow up ammunition trucks. There is
a lot of shooting on the street. A lot of people are informing.''
   British Airways, the handling agent for Sunday's charter, said
163 Americans among the 438 passengers would leave for Baltimore
this afternoon. The Americans spent the night in a hotel at Gatwick.
   In Charleston, S.C., 305 weary U.S. evacuees _ mostly women and
children _ sang ``God Bless America'' when their chartered jet from
Jordan touched down late Sunday. They were greeted with applause by
those waiting at the airport after the Boeing 747 landed.
   An estimated 21,000 Westerners were in Iraq and Kuwait when Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, and U.S. officials estimate about 2,200
Americans remain. Some of the men in that group have been sent to
military installations to serve as human shields against possible
attack.
   Theresa Fannon, a 46-year-old nurse from Northern Ireland, and
other staff members of a Kuwait hospital decided to join a bus
convoy to Baghdad: ``It was 4 a.m. when we were stopped at a
checkpoint and taken to the police station which had been turned
into an Iraqi military base.
   ``There were young soldiers waving guns about and they kept us
outside in the boiling heat for eight hours.''
   The small party of Britons were then taken to a sorting center
and left out in the sun for another four hours.
   ``We nearly died that day, left 12 hours in the heat,'' Miss
Fannon said.
   Once in Baghdad the Iraqis split up families and couples at a
city hotel: ``It was tragic watching the husbands standing there on
the steps with the children crying and the wives getting ready to
leave,'' she said.
   ``Most of the men have lost a lot of weight and look pale as
they have been under house arrest for five weeks.
   ``We assumed they were being moved to military installations and
neither the British nor the Irish embassies seem to have much idea
where they were going.''

<HEAD>U.S. Pilots Defer Most Attack Decisions To Saudis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OVER SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American fighter pilots have been
ordered, except in the most threatening situations, to wait for a
go-ahead from Saudi commanders before firing at any Iraqi jets,
U.S. Air Force officers say.
   The restrained rules of engagement apply even in some cases in
which Iraqi jets are deemed hostile.
   The rules are designed to sigificantly cut the risk of an
American pilot firing the first shot in a war with Iraq and
upsetting the volatile regional politics that now have most Arab
nations behind the United States and Saudi Arabia, the officials
said Sunday.
   ``The one thing we don't want to do is start a war by someone
making a mistake,'' said Air Force Col. Tom Bliss, commander of
U.S. Airborne Warning and Control System _ or AWACS _ operations in
the Middle East.
   ``It's not one of those `shoot first and ask questions later'
situations,'' he said.
   Bliss said that if an AWACS plane were to detect a potentially
hostile Iraqi aircraft, it would relay the information to the
command post in Saudi Arabia's eastern province. There, the Saudis
are in control but an American is always on duty.
   It would be up to the Saudis to formally designate the aircraft
hostile and in most cases to decide whether to open fire, Bliss
said.
   ``Under almost all situations, we want the Saudis to make the
call,'' he said.
   However, the Saudis do not have permission to order U.S. forces
to attack Iraqi forces.
   Under the rules, the Saudis can tell American fighters to make a
risky visual identification of Iraqi jets _ even if the
sophisticated detection systems aboard U.S. aircraft already have
positively identified the jet, Bliss said.
   Exceptions to these rules could occur if communication between
the air and the Saudis on the ground were lost or if an individual
pilot determined his aircraft to be in imminent danger, Bliss said.
   If communications were lost, crew chiefs aboard the AWACS would
work with their weapons officers and could make the decision to
fire on Iraqi jets provided certain criteria were met, Air Force
officers said.
   A pilot acting alone could decide to fire at a hostile jet, but
he too would first have to follow a clear set of guidleines, the
officers said.
   For tactical and security reasons, the officers discussed the
rules of engagement on condition those guidelines were not
disclosed.
   ``We don't want the other guy to know how we would react to a
certain situation,'' Bliss said. But he added: ``We're taking every
precaution so somebody doesn't pull the trigger.''
   The rules for the U.S. pilots are not unlike those for American
ground troops.
   Although the American forces are spreading out in increasing
numbers in northern Saudi Arabia _ within striking distance of
Iraqi forces in Iraq and occupied Kuwait _ they are deliberately
being kept behind Arab forces led by the Saudi army.
   Ground commanders over the last two weeks have said the
deployment is designed to make it highly unlikely an American would
fire the first shot in a ground war or be the first casualty if
Iraq's Saddam Hussein ordered an attack.
   Bliss said another reason for the caution in the air is the
possibility of Iraqi defectors.
   He said U.S. and Saudi pilots assumed any Iraqi pilot trying to
defect would attempt to communicate his intentions and avoid any
maneuvers that could be interpreted as hostile.
   Monitoring of Iraqi air activity during a 15-hour AWACS mission
that began Saturday evening and ended Sunday morning confirmed
recent reports that the Iraqis generally fly few sorties at night.
   American and Saudi jets flying air patrols around the clock are
generally staying clear of airspace claimed by Baghdad, including
that over occupied Kuwait.
   ``I haven't seen provocative acts on either side,'' said a
senior American Air Force official in Saudi Arabia who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``But I wouldn't say they're going out of their way to avoid a
provocation.''
   Bliss and members of the AWACS crew interviewed during the AWACS
mission said the Iraqis were conducting frequent daytime missions,
some of which appeared to be combat air patrols and others routine
training flights.
   On occasion, the Iraqis fly close to the Saudi border _ once
within four miles, crew members said.

<TEXT>
   Sorry, sir, there are no plans for an
underwater shopping mall in the Inner Harbor. No, ma'am, a highway
is not coming through your living room. And no, pull tabs from soda
cans and empty cigarette packs do not pay for kidney dialysis.
   For 22 years, operators at the city's rumor control center have
been handing out facts and dispelling rumors for confused or
curious citizens.
   ``The rumor was it would be an underwater mall and they would
have a restaurant and you could pick out your dinner from behind
the glass,'' said Tom Saunders, who's worked for the hot line for
10 years. ``We had contractors calling up wanting to build it.''
   Rumor control hot lines were opened in several major cities in
the 1960s to ease tension in the wake of race riots. Although the
violence of that era has passed, Baltimore's hot line still has a
place, and some cities that dropped theirs are reviving the idea,
Saunders said.
   Philadelphia recently opened a rumor-control hot line after a
black man was shot to death by a Korean shopkeeper, he said.
   Besides handling the frivolous rumors, Baltimore officials say,
the hot line keeps the public informed about topics that could
affect health or safety _and helps the city to keep in touch with
its residents.
   ``It's a place people can call to get good information, but also
cast a straw vote, in effect, for things the city should be doing
to enhance the community,'' said City Council President Mary Pat
Clarke.
   ``We don't try to appease people. We give them the facts from a
creditable source,'' said Lillian Jones, head of the community
division of the city's community relations commission, which
operates the hot line.
   Calls from people expressing a desire to heal race relations
helped lead to the scheduled meeting of community leaders in
November. The calls followed several apparently racially motivated
incidents this summer.
   Each day one of the six workers in Baltimore's community
relations office takes a turn staffing the hot line, answering
questions and collecting rumors.
   ``Most of the rumors are in reference to news events. People
receive misinformation or bits and pieces and they call rumor
control,'' Saunders said.
   Workers try to keep abreast of current events, he said. A
bulletin board on the wall of the small downtown office is littered
with news articles, fliers and information about events that have
been brought to the staff's attention.
   Rumors called in by the public range from the far-fetched to the
mundane. Health, safety and neighborhood issues make up the
majority of calls.
   One of the most unusual rumors called in recently involved the
Ku Klux Klan's purported ownership of a popular line of sweatsuits.
   ``The rumor was the guy who owned it was on a television show
and he said blacks will overpay for anything,'' Saunders said. ``He
said he was a member of the Klan and decided to put out an
expensive sweatsuit.
   ``We found out a Jewish person owned the company, therefore he
wouldn't be a member of the Ku Klux Klan.''
   The hot line still gets calls from people wondering where to
send empty cigarette packs and pull tabs from soda cans to help pay
for kidney dialysis.
   ``People have trash bags of cigarette packs. I run into people
myself at the barber shop who ask for cigarette packages and pull
tabs,'' Saunders said. ``They swear to me they know what they are
talking about.''

<TEXT>
   A inmate convicted in the shotgun
slaying of an elderly man who walked in on a burglary was put to
death by injection early Monday in Oklahoma's first execution in 24
years.
   Charles Troy Coleman, 43, was pronounced dead at 12:35 a.m. at
Oklahoma State Penitentiary.
   ``Just tell everybody I love them and I have a peace and quiet
heart,'' Coleman, his voice quivering, said shortly before he died.
At one point, he turned toward his attorney, Mandy Welch, and said,
``I love you, Mandy.''
   As he died, candlelight vigils were held outside the prison and
at the Capitol in Oklahoma City.
   Oklahoma becomes the 15th state to execute someone since the
U.S. Supreme Court in 1976 allowed use of the death penalty to
resume. Coleman was the 138th person put to death in the United
States since the high court ruling.
   Coleman had been sentenced to die for the 1979 slaying of John
Seward in Muskogee. Seward, 68, and his wife, Roxie, 62, were
killed when they surprised a burglar at a relative's home. Coleman
was not tried in Mrs. Seward's death.
   Coleman's truck was seen at the home, and custom-cut meat and
other possessions from the house were found in his truck when he
was arrested.
   He had more than 25 appeals in his 11-year fight to escape
execution, coming within 36 hours of execution three years ago
before receiving a stay. The U.S. Supreme Court had turned down his
case seven times, twice on Sunday.
   His final request for a stay failed in a 6-1 vote, with Justice
Thurgood Marshall dissenting. Justice Harry Blackmun did not
participate.
   The defense had raised mental competency questions in seeking a
stay.
   The last person put to death in Oklahoma was James D. French,
electrocuted in 1966 for killing his cellmate. Oklahoma has 115
people on death row.
   Gov. Henry Bellmon, who also was governor in 1966, had denied
clemency to Coleman.
   ``There is obviously a sadistic streak of behavior in this
case,'' he said. ``The question is should a man like this ever be
placed back in society. I think the answer is no.''
   Coleman's wife, Lynda, said in a statement: ``Charles is in a
better place. He is with God and at peace now. I don't have to
worry about him suffering anymore.
   ``It is really sad that people are so bloodthirsty, but really I
don't condemn them. They think it is right but I don't believe it's
right with God. The 10 Commandments say, `Thou shalt not kill.' ''
   Coleman had been in and out of prison since he was a teen-ager
on charges including burglary, robbery, assault and murder. He was
acquitted in 1976 in California in the beating and stabbing death
of his girlfriend's father.
   Police said Coleman escaped from the jail while awaiting trial
in the Seward case, later slashing a policeman's throat and
stealing his gun.
   Police believe the officer's gun was used to kill a man in Tulsa.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
was expected today to announce he would go to Damascus later this
week to meet with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   The visit would surely boost Syria's standing, even though it
remains on a State Department list of seven terrorism-sponsoring
countries.
   Shattering old line-ups in the Middle East, the administration
since the Persian Gulf crisis began has been courting both Syria
and Iran to put pressure on Iraq to force it to relinquish control
of Kuwait.
   Assad, a bitter foe of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, has sent
troops to both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as part of
a U.S.-led Persian Gulf defense force.
   Iran, meanwhile, is said to be observing the economic boycott of
Iraq called for by the U.N. Security Council on Aug. 2.
   U.S. officials said Baker informed Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy of his schedule at a meeting last Thursday in Washington.
   The State Department in its annual human rights reports
consistently has criticized Syria's domestic practices while the
Office of Counter-terrorism has implicated Palestinian groups
operating out of the Syria-controlled Bekaa Valley of Lebanon in
attacks on Americans and Israelis.
   One such incident was the bombing of a Pan Am passenger plane
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, The Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine _ General Command, which is maintained
by Syria, is suspected of the attack.
   The group also faces charges in West Germany of attempting to
blow up troop trains carrying Americans.
   ``There is no evidence that Syrian officials were involved in
planning or executing terrorist attacks outside Lebanon since
1987,'' the department said in this year's ``Patterns of Global
Terrorism.''
   However, the report said, ``they continue to provide support and
safe haven to a number of groups that engaged in international
terrorism.''
   Also, the report said, despite Syrian statements abhoring
terrorism, Syria considers Palestinian terrorist incidents directed
against targets in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza ``to be part
of the legitimate Palestinian struggle for independence.''
   Baker flew to Brussels after attending President Bush's meeting
in Helsinki, Finland, with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Baker's two main tasks in the six-hour stop were to report to
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the summit and to solicit
contributions from the 12-nation European Community for the
campaign against Iraq.

<HEAD>Pageant Director: No Decision on Parks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bert Parks' flubbed return to the
Miss America pageant was blamed on two pages of his script sticking
together.
   Miss Illinois Marjorie Judith Vincent, a 25-year-old law student
from Oak Park, was crowned early Sunday as Miss America 1991.
   Parks, fired as emcee 10 years ago for being too old, got a
standing ovation at the start of the pageant Saturday night but
skipped the names of at least a dozen former Miss Americas during
the introduction of 29 past winners.
   At one point, the 75-year-old crooner also rambled and was
interrupted by master of ceremonies Gary Collins.
   Pageant director Leonard Horn said Sunday he has not decided
whether to invite Parks back next year but that the blunder would
not affect his decision.
   ``It's a shame for Bert because he was so excited. ... It's one
of the chances you take with live TV,'' Horn said.
   The mistake came when two pages in Park's script stuck together,
Horn said. ``I don't have a gut reaction to it,'' the pageant
director said. ``Apparently he went to card three and skipped card
two in his excitement.''
   Parks also rambled about raunchy comedians and a good place to
eat on the Boardwalk, and he asked America to refer to women as
``ladies'' rather than ``chicks.'' Collins took Parks by the arm
and said it was time to let the contestants speak.
   Horn said Parks did not ad-lib too long.
   ``It's very unfair of the press to think he was dragged off,''
Horn said. ``I thought he was wonderful. He brought an excitement
to the show and to this town.''
   Reached at home in Greenwich, Conn., Parks' wife, Annette, said
her husband was not available for comment Sunday.
   Miss Vincent, a third-year law student at Duke University who
wants to practice international law, credited her victory to
determination and a lifelong ambition to participate in the pageant.
   She spoke to reporters on the Boardwalk shortly after 7 a.m.
Sunday for the traditional ``frolicking in the surf'' picture.
   ``If you want to achieve a goal and work for it very hard, you
can achieve it,'' Miss Vincent said in French to the people of
Haiti, from which her parents immigrated.
   She chose the plight of battered women as the issue she will
emphasize during her reign.
   She said she was stunned that she won, finally falling asleep at
4 a.m., and wants to celebrate with the cheesecake that was
previously denied her.
   ``I still don't believe I'm here,'' said Miss Vincent, wearing
the pageant's rhinestone tiara and a sapphire blue dress with an
olive green, purple and black scarf. ``It still doesn't seem real.''

<HEAD>Stocks Soar in Tokyo, Dollar Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices soared in Tokyo today, with the Tokyo
Stock Exchange's main index posting its sixth-largest daily gain in
response to the U.S.-Soviet summit, traders said.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 139.43 yen
after ranging between 139.33 yen and 139.65 yen. Today's close _
down 0.82 yen from Friday _ was the lowest in Tokyo since Oct. 2,
when the U.S. currency finished trading at 139.30 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Index rose 1,118.83 points, or 4.67
percent, ending the day at 25,080.90. An estimated 330 million
shares traded hands on the market's first section.
   Today's sixth-largest single-day increase followed a
150.16-point rise Friday.
   Traders said the Nikkei index began rising sharply in response
to the outcome of the summit Sunday in Helsinki, Finland, where
President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed on
responses to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Kazuo Horikoshi, a dealer with New Japan Securities, said
large-scale buying contributed strongly to Monday's surge.
   ``Share prices jumped as soon as the market opened today, and
the surge in the spot market prompted rises in the futures also,''
he said.
   Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with Nomura Securities Co., said
the Nikkei's rise in part was a technical adjustment before the
final trading day for September futures, scheduled for Thursday.
   He said some bargain hunting also helped push up the index.
   The stock market, which has been reacting tensely to
developments in the gulf since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, slid
for four days last week and hit its lowest trading level of the
year before Friday's recovery.
   Dealers said cross-trading, in which investors bought the yen by
selling European currencies for profit-taking, weakened the dollar
against the yen.
   Masato Hayashi of the Bank of Tokyo attributed the dollar's
slide to widespread pessimism about the U.S. economy.
   ``Because the gulf situation is prolonged and seems to be going
nowhere, investors' concern is now focused more on a slowdown in
the U.S. economy,'' he said.
   Hayashi said investors were actively selling the dollar, aiming
at the 138.50-yen level, on expectations of a possible relaxation
of U.S. monetary policy.
   Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno told a news
conference today that Japan's recent discount rate increase and the
rise in oil prices to $30 a barrel do not pose a threat to Japan's
economy. But he noted the economic environment remains ``in a
serious state of flux.''
   Mieno said the effects of ``Iraq shock'' remain manageable at
the $30 a barrel level, compared to economic setbacks Japan
experienced in two previous oil shocks in the 1970s.
   The nation's central bank raised its official discount rate on
Aug. 30 from 5.25 percent to 6 percent in an effort to cool
inflationary pressure prompted by oil price increases resulting
from the Gulf crisis.
   On the bond market, the yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese bonds closed at 8.225 percent, down from Friday's 8.245
percent. Their price rose to 82.57 points from Friday's 82.48.

<HEAD>Iraqis Said To Caused Disaster In Kuwaiti Medical Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dead bodies stored in an ice rink,
mental patients roaming the streets and people dying due to a lack
of hospital care.
   That is the grim medical picture painted by a group of Kuwaiti
exiles gathering reports about life in their Iraqi-occupied country.
   ``There are no medical services except for scattered Kuwaiti
doctors running clinics from their homes,'' says Dr. Fawzia
al-Sayegh, a pediatrician who used to split her time between London
and Kuwait.
   ``If you have an emergency, you die,'' she said, adding that
Iraqi troops control the hospitals and have denied access to
Kuwaitis.
   Information received by the exiles comes from people fleeing
Kuwait and from short-wave or satellite radio transmissions from
the country.
   The information could not be independently verified because all
regular telephone and mail communication has been cut off by the
estimated 170,000 Iraqi troops who have occupied the country in the
wake of the Aug. 2 invasion.
   Up to 1 million people are estimated trapped in Kuwait.
   The exiles, some of them members of Kuwait's ruling al-Sabah
clan, relayed chilling tales of food shortages, killings, and
hospital patients dying after being deprived of life-sustaining
equipment.
   Some of the stories deal with medical care, the pride of Kuwait
until a month ago. Free care used to be given to citizens at
hospitals boasting some of the most advanced equipment in the world.
   Among the claims made by the Kuwaitis, gathered from numerous
interviews as well as from statements by Mohammed Abulhasan,
Kuwait's U.N. ambassador:
   _Twenty-two premature babies died shortly after the Iraqi
invasion when troops took away their oxygen supplies. Abulhasan
mentioned this is a letter to the U.N. Security Council. The deaths
were said to occur six days after the invasion.
   _Bodies of dead Kuwaitis are being stored in what used to be an
ice-skating rink, according Sheika Merian Al-Sabah, daughter of
Kuwait's crown prince.
   _Four cases of cholera, an often fatal disease that breeds in
unsanitary conditions, have been reported, Dr. al-Sayegh said.
Cholera is transmitted through contaminated food and water.
   _Iraqi troops have pillaged five regular hospitals, stealing
equipment and transferring plasma deposits from blood banks to
Baghdad. The hospitals were emptied of regular patients, some of
whom died, exiles said.
   ``They want to prepare the hospitals for Iraqi war injuries,''
Dr. al-Sayegh said.
   _Two Kuwaiti and one Egyptian woman were left to care for 130
handicapped and mentally disturbed children after the invasion.
Many of the former caregivers _ mostly expatriate Asians _ fled the
country after the invasion, Dr. al-Sayegh said.
   _Mental patients were let out of the psychiatric hospital to
roam the streets without medication or care. ``They don't know what
is happening. They are sick,'' the pediatrician said. It was her
understanding that most of the patients have been taken in to
private homes.
   _Ambulances no longer function because Iraqi troops shot out the
tires of many vehicles, Dr. al-Sayegh said.

<TEXT>
   New Kids on the Block are fast shedding their
squeaky-clean image as an All-American pop group as they make
headlines over an increasing number of scuffles.
   New Kids' lawyer, Len Lewin, planned a trip to the West Coast
today to talk to members of the group about their offstage behavior.
   ``Some program is going to be established to change things
around as to how they conduct themselves. I think something has to
be done,'' Lewin said. ``We're going to sit down with parents,
kids, management, the whole team.''
   The Boston Globe published an editorial suggesting that New Kids
on the Block, while ``craftily marketed as clean-cut, churchgoing
inner-city youths,'' are actually ``success-spoiled youths who
badly need disciplining.''
   In the past month, the quintet of teen-agers from a
working-class background in Boston's Dorchester section and their
retinue were involved in at least six violent incidents. No charges
have been filed against the group.
   In the most recent incident, New Kid Donnie Wahlberg, 20,
allegedly scuffled with a 20-year-old Harvard student over an
airline seat Sept. 2 on a flight from Salt Lake City to Atlanta.
Wahlberg allegedly punched Benjamin Dattner as some of the group's
entourage held him down.
   The two exchanged blows after Wahlberg poked Dattner in the eye,
witnesses said. Dattner was taken to a hospital for a scratched
cornea and bruises and was released.
   The group's tarnished image has left some of its legions of
young fans, or ``blockheads,'' a little disillusioned.
   ``I'm not sure I'm liking them anymore because they don't act
like they used to,'' Kristin Bothwell, 10, of the city's Roxbury
section, said last week. ``People are getting into fights and they
might start a big bad fight.''
   Wahlberg has been the group member most involved in the
incidents. Last month, he and his bodyguard allegedly tussled with
Georgia Tech students in Atlanta. The same night, group member
Jordan Knight was accused of hitting a 21-year-old woman in a bar,
and his bodyguard was accused of beating up two men.
   In Massachusetts, two of Wahlberg's brothers were arrested in
front of his home in suburban Braintree during a fight. A man from
Foxboro said last month he was beaten up by relatives of group
members at a Quincy nightclub.
   Lewin said he was still trying to gather facts about the latest
incident. He said some of the Kids' trouble ``may just come with
the territory.''
   ``Is there anything you can do about it? I'm not so sure,'' he
said.
   The group has been enormously popular, mainly with teen-agers
and pre-teens. Its tours have been marked by sellouts and pressing
throngs. Two April concerts in England led to the hospitalization
of several frenetic fans, and first-aid had to be administered to
hundreds of youngsters.
   At this year's American Music Awards, New Kids won the favorite
pop-rock album trophy for their ``Hangin' Tough'' LP and were named
favorite pop-rock group.

   A giant panda that was born via artificial
insemination has given birth to twins conceived through the same
method, according to an official report.
   The mother, Qingqing, gave birth to Guanguan, a female cub, and
Junjun, a male, last month in a zoo in the southwestern city of
Chengdu, the Xinhua News Agency said Sunday. The cubs, born last
month, are healthy, it said.
   Qingqing conceived the twins through artificial insemination
using frozen semen, the report said. It said Qingqing also was the
product of artificial insemination but did not say when she was
born.
   Fewer than 1,000 of the endangered giant pandas still live in
the wild, most of them in southwestern China near Chengdu.

   Here is a breakdown of the multinational
force in the Persian Gulf:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   UNITED STATES: Officials say more than 100,000 troops, including
those aboard ships, are in the gulf region or on the way.
Deployments could go as high as 250,000.
   The troops include elements of the 82nd and 101st Airborne
Divisions, the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division, the 11th Air
Defense Artillery Brigade and the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, and
other units. They also include a contingent of 45,000 Marines.
   The U.S. fleet in the region totals about 30 ships, including
three aircraft carriers, a battleship, more than a dozen missile
cruisers, destroyers, supply ships and an undisclosed number of
submarines. Two hospital ships are sailing for the gulf. Another
seven ships are expected in the Mediterranean.
   In the air, the Americans have sent 22 F-117 Stealth
fighter-bombers, as well as several squadrons of F-16s, F-15s, A-10
Thunderbolt ground-attack jets and dozens of other aircraft.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BRITAIN: A flotilla is permanently stationed in the gulf and has
contributed four warships: two destroyers and two frigates armed
with Exocet and Seawolf missiles.
   Also dispatched were two squadrons of Tornadoes and one squadron
of Jaguar fighter-bombers. The F3 Tornado interceptors are based in
Saudi Arabia. The Jaguars are in neighboring Oman. There are also
three Nimrod maritime reconnaisance aircraft stationed in Oman.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   FRANCE: Nine ships are either in the gulf or en route, including
the aircraft carrier Clemenceau with anti-tank helicopters, a
guided-missile cruiser and two destroyers equipped with anti-ship
Exocet missiles, two frigates and one corvette. The helicopters
will be sent to Saudi Arabia.
   France has deployed 7,000 men, most of whom are aboard ship. The
French force also includes 190 paratroopers sent to the United Arab
Emirates, equipped for chemical warfare.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WEST GERMANY: Five navy minesweepers and two supply ships have
been sent to replace U.S. ships pulled out of NATO duty in the
Mediterranean for the gulf. The West German constitution is being
interpreted as banning the stationing of troops in other than NATO
areas. Although all major parties favor dropping the ban, it is not
expected until after all-German elections set for Dec. 2.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, United
Arab Emirates, Qatar and until Aug. 2, Kuwait): A rapid deployment
force of up to 10,000 troops based in northeast Saudi Arabia. They
would be supported by Saudi Arabian forces.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOVIET UNION: Moscow has sent an Udaloy-class destroyer armed
with surface-to-air missiles and an anti-submarine ship. Further
deployments have not been ruled out.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ITALY: Two frigates and a support ship are in the gulf.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   JAPAN: Its postwar constitution bars it from sending troops
overseas. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has offered $1 billion,
medical personnel, transportation and supplies to the multinational
force but rejected any direct role for Japan's military. Under the
plan, Japan will use civilian airplanes and ships to transport
food, water and medical supplies to the gulf.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SPAIN: Sending one frigate and two corvettes. The frigate will
be based in the Gulf of Oman. The corvettes are en route to Bab El
Mandeb Strait at the entrance to the Red Sea.

<HEAD>Kohl Wants Troops from United Germany in U.N. Peacekeeping Forces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl says he wants a
constitutional change that would let troops from a united Germany
take part in U.N. peacekeeping missions.
   Such a change would come in December at the earliest, Kohl said
Sunday.
   Since the Persian Gulf crisis began, West German officials have
said a clause in their constitution bars them from sending troops
to back up U.S. soldiers and those from other nations.
   That stance has led to criticism in Washington.
   Kohl cited the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 as a clear
example of why a constitutional change is needed to permit German
soldiers in U.N. missions.
   ``As a member of the United Nations, we cannot stand to the side
when the U.N. asks us to take responsiblity,'' Kohl said in an
interview on Deutschlandfunk radio, repeating the stance his
government took last month.
   Kohl said he will seek such a change after the first joint
German elections Dec. 2.
   Although Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats are favored to
win the elections, a victory by the leftist Social Democrats would
make such a constitutional change much less likely.
   The chancellor referred to criticism that his country is not
doing enough to counter Iraq's current aggression.
   Kohl said many people in other countries say of the Germans:
``When it's a question of making money, they're right there. But
when it comes to taking responsibility, they slip away.''
   ``That's an opinion that you can already meet in many places
internationally,'' the chancellor said.
   West Germany has also been asked to provide money for the U.S.
soldiers in the gulf. Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
scheduled to discuss the issue during a visit Saturday to Bonn.

   An Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia would
collapse within two weeks, but Iraqi troops dug in at their
southern border and Kuwait could resist a U.S. offensive for months
and inflict heavy casualties, analysts say.
   ``War is always a political decision. But there's a less than 5
percent chance of war if that decision is made by logical military
thinking,'' said one high-ranking Western military officer in
Baghdad. ``Neither side has a viable military option now.''
   Western military analysts argued that as Iraq slowly crumbles
under U.N. economic sanctions imposed after it invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2, there is less and less reason for any attack to force
concessions from President Saddam Hussein.
   Iraq, they say, cannot afford to resort to a military strike.
   The analysts contended Iraqi aircraft are no match for the U.S.
warplanes and believe the Americans would quickly gain air
superiority. But some said Iraq, with its army of about 1 million
men, has some of the best ground forces in the world and that a
conventional war cannot be won by air power alone.
   In addition, Iraq's chances for battlefield success are hurt by
its leadership and its inability to take full advantage of the
sophisticated weapons it possesses, the analysts said.
   Saddam, who has no military training, gives the orders, and the
analysts said they were not impressed by his tactical decisions
during the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88.
   However, they said the lightning invasion of Kuwait indicated
that Saddam might be learning and heeding military advisers trained
abroad.
   ``It was well planned and well executed. But there was no real
opponent. We don't know how effectively they can overcome massive
resistance,'' one analyst said. Like the others, he spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Because of the international economic embargo ordered by the
United Nations, Iraq is now hobbled by supply line problems,
shortages of spare parts and a lack of foreign technicians to
maintain its sophisticated air force and highly mechanized army.
Under these conditions, an Iraqi attack into Saudi Arabia would
crumble within weeks, the analysts said.
   ``During an overall attack ... its operational status would fall
to 40-50 percent in two weeks,'' one said.
   But dug in behind the border with a month's supply of spare
parts, Iraq could hold out for two months, withstanding massive air
attacks and inflicting tens of thousands of casualties, the
analysts said.
   One said it would be possible to defeat Iraq, but any attack
would be costly and dangerous.
   ``If there's a war, it'll be a real war _ not limited war. So we
can expect lots of casualties,'' he said. ``You can be sure the
Iraqis would fight.''
   Even when the vast buildup of U.S. and multinational forces is
complete, the hasty alliance would be unable to strike Iraq with
any guarantee of success, the analysts said.
   ``Iraq has the third- or fourth-largest armed forces in the
world,'' said one. ``Iraqi equipment is comparable to almost any
Western army.''
   In addition to the 1 million men, Iraq has 2 million reservists.
It has 25 divisions _ 400,000 battle-seasoned troops _ in Kuwait
and southern Iraq.
   The infantry is supported by two armored divisions, 1,500 tanks
and 1,000 other armored vehicles, 700 artillery pieces and about
1,200 surface-to-surface missiles of various kinds, the analysts
said.
   In Kuwait alone, Iraq has massed 16 divisions comprising 170,000
to 180,000 men, they said.
   Conventional military wisdom holds that an attacking force needs
a 3-1 superiority, one analyst noted. That means that U.S. forces
attacking on a front 25 to 32 miles wide would need 350,000 men.
   At the moment, the United States has only about 100,000 troops
in Saudi Arabia.
   ``On the ground, Iraq's superior to almost any force the United
States can bring in,'' said the high-ranking Western officer.
``Iraq's air force is modern _ at least as modern as West
Germany's.''
   Iraq has more than 1,000 combat aircraft on 20 to 25 bases
heavily protected by Soviet-made surface-to-air missiles and
anti-aircraft guns, one Western analyst said.
   Iraq's deployment of its aircraft around so many well-defended
bases means the Americans will not be able to knock out the Iraqi
air force with a quick decisive first strike, one analyst said.
   Moreoever, Iraq is thought to have about 300 missiles capable of
hurling warheads 167 miles, about 400 with a range of 372 miles and
about 45 launchers for both types of missiles.
   The analysts believe Iraq has few, if any, chemical warheads for
their missiles, but said the threat of chemical warfare is very
real in battlefield areas within range of artillery gas shells.
   The analysts also said there are some morale problems among
Iraqi troops because the army cannot supply them with enough water
and good food.
   There are also signs of problems in the officer corps. Some
officers were executed for opposing the invasion of Kuwait, as many
as 120 by some unconfirmed reports.

<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 5th, 6th grafs to add first reference to HHS Secretary
Sullivan in 5th graf. Picks up 7th graf bgng The position</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardiologist Bernadine P. Healy, research
director of a Cleveland clinic and a former federal health
official, is in line to head the National Institutes of Health as
the first woman in that job, sources say.
   The 46-year-old physician, a former president of the American
Heart Association as well as the American Federation for Clinical
Research, would become the 13th director of the world renowned
research facility.
   Gary Weiland, a spokesman at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation,
said Sunday that Healy was traveling out of town and he did not
know how to contact her regarding accounts of her pending
appointment.
   Weiland said he was unaware of any notification to the clinic
that Healy had been chosen for the NIH post, which has remained
vacant during most of the Bush administration because of
controversy swirling around the potential positions on abortion of
the new chief.
   Initial word of Healy's selection by Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan came from Medicine and Health, a
Washington-based newsletter. The New York Times carried an account
in its Monday editions.
   It was understood that Healy was the choice of Sullivan, but
that her nomination has not been formally sent to the White House
for approval by President Bush.
   The position also is subject to Senate confirmation.
   Healy, who well known within the government health
establishments, was a member of an NIH advisory committee that
recommended government approval of fetal tissue research to see
cures to various illnesses _ a recommendation that was overruled by
both the Reagan and Bush administrations.
   While members of that panel generally refrained from stating a
direct position on abortion, Healy forcefully stated her view that
it was demeaning to women to argue that the acceptance of fetal
research as a federal policy would prompt someone to have an
abortion who was otherwise opposed to the practice.
   As word of her pending appointment began circulating, the
National Right to Life Committee said it could not support her for
the job, but stopped short of outright opposition.
   ``We fear that Dr. Healy may for the moment agree to `support'
the administration policies on these (abortion) issues, but then
work with pro-abortion members of congress to open loopholes big
enough for truckloads of fetal tissue and abortion pill,'' said
Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the anti-abortion group.
   He said that the NRLC ``cannot support this nomination, but we
do not currently intend to oppose Dr. Healy's confirmation in the
Senate.''
   His mention of an ``abortion pill'' was in reference to calls
for federal approval of a French-approved so-called ``morning
after'' abortion pill.
   At least four previous candidates reportedly have turned down
the NIH appointment rather than adhere to the anti-abortion
position in general and the question of fetal tissue research in
particular.
   Among them was Dr. William Danforth, chancellor of Washington
University in St. Louis and the brother of Sen. John Danforth,
R-Mo., who complained of being subjected to a ``litmus test'' on
abortion.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater subsequently told
reporters that candidates for ``jobs that are essentially technical
or below the assistant secretary'' of health and human services
level would not be held to the same standard on abortion as higher
level political appointees.
   Healy was an assistant director of the White House's Office of
Science and Technology Policy during the Reagan administration from
1984 to 1986 and began her medical career as a fellow in pathology
in the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in 1972 after
receiving her medical degree from Harvard Medical School and
interning at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
   The National Institutes of Health, consisting of 14 separate
branches that investigate the causes and treatments of illnesses
such as cancer, heart disease and AIDS, is part of the Department
of Health and Human Services.

   A whole nation breathes easier today.
   Americans came this close to having Bart Simpson with a tennis
racket masquerading as their national champion. Instead, they got a
well-groomed, sometimes painfully polite kid who is a throwback to
the courtly gentlemen of a byone era and still lives with his
parents.
   ``I'm just a normal 19-year-old,'' Pete Sampras said, ``growing
up with a very unusual job.''
   If only Andre Agassi's life were that simple. Because the
neon-green outfits and the Vegas showgirl hair, the endorsements,
the entourage and the on-court emotions cannot hide the fact that
Agassi is still without the one thing he needs and wants most _ a
Grand Slam title to validate his talent.
   ``If you convinced me that he was that cool on the inside, then
I would be amazed,'' the 20-year-old Agassi said, still smarting
from the 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 spanking Sampras administered in the U.S.
Open final Sunday.
   ``But I don't believe that, and I don't think that even he
admits to being that cool on the inside,'' Agassi continued. ``It's
amazing that he could play so solidly and not show it.''
   Believe it, Andre. Pete does. And he just may be.
   Because just like that, Sampras became the youngest champion is
U.S. Open history and in the bargain delivered what Agassi and
nearly everyone else in the suddenly resurgent American brat pack _
23-year-olds Aaron Krickstein and Jay Berger, 21-year-old David
Wheaton and 20-year-old Jim Courier _ have only promised.
   With a serve like a siege gun and a few hundred swings on an
overcast day in cool New York, he joined 1989 French Open winner
Michael Chang in proving that excellence is what the game is about,
and that being ranked among the top two dozen players in the world
should mean more than a spot in line at the payroll window.
   Until Sampras turned the trick on the stadium court Sunday at
the National Tennis Center, no Yank, man or woman, had hoisted the
silver trophy since John McEnroe in 1984.
   Sure, it was tempting during the lean years to try to count the
transplanted Czechs Ivan Lendl (1985-87) and Martina Navratilova
(1983-84, 1986-87) as American champions. Yet anyone so easily
suckered was quickly reminded that the best hope of American tennis
was supposed to be its junior development programs and not the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   But no more.
   Here, where the melting pot boils over on occasion, five of the
quarterfinalists and three of the semifinalists were American brat
packers _ counting the resilient McEnroe, who at 31 may not be
young but is still most certainly a brat.
   Of the foreign contingent still around by the final eight, No. 3
seed Lendl was ousted by Sampras, and unseeded Soviet Andrei
Cherkasov and defending champion and No. 2 Boris Becker of West
Germany were dumped in succession by Agassi.
   It should have come as little surprise, then, that the strains
of ``I'm Proud to be an American'' were piped over the loudspeakers
when Sampras, of Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., and Agassi, of Las
Vegas (which, for these purposes, counts as part of the United
States) made their way onto the court Sunday.
   And even less surprise that Sampras, who had gunned down the
stubborn McEnroe a day earlier, was as cool as he claimed to be
afterward.
   ``From the first point, I felt really good,'' he said. And who
is going to argue? After drilling his first serve of the match into
the net, Sampras reared back again and dealt the first of 13 aces
with his second serve.
   ``I think that when I serve as well as I did this week, it puts
(fear) in the mind of my opponents,'' he said. ``When they're
serving, they might get tight or something because I'm serving so
well. That plants the seed in their mind that if they play one bad
game, then the set may be over.''
   That actually may be understating the case. Against seven
opponents, Sampras played a total of 238 games. He served in 117 of
those and held all but 12, or roughly nine games out of every 10.
By contrast, Sampras' opponents served 121 times, and he broke
through 38 times, or better than three out of every 10 service
games.
   No wonder he looked so cool.
   ``If you looked at the tape, you'd see all his aces are on the
line. That's just rough. The chance of returning serves hit at 100
mph when it hits the line are slim,'' Agassi said, ``not to mention
when he blasts one at 120 mph.''
   Despite the high-tech racket those rockets issue from, Sampras
is actually a throwback to the classic tennis player, with his
serve-and-volley style, one-handed backhand and (in sharp contrast
to the often-sullen, occasionally obscene and
sometimes-spit-spewing Agassi) even temperament.
   The serve came suddenly _ ``I just got bigger, stronger,
taller,'' Sampras recalled _ but he took one hand off the racket
while playing in the junior ranks after being convinced it offered
more versatility.
   And though he grew up as a player during a time when ugly
Americans Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe had their way with the
game and its officials, Sampras took his cues on how to behave from
Australian greats Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall, whose matches he saw
only on film.
   ``I have tremendous respect for those guys. I really do,''
Sampras said. ``All those guys were class individuals and I'd like
to be thought of in that category.''
   Incredibly (talk about bad intelligence information), when No. 1
tennis buff George Bush wanted to jump on the American bandwagon by
calling one of the three homegrown semifinalists while en route to
the summit in Helsinki, he chose Agassi.
   When first informed of the call, Sampras asked, incredulously,
``The president? I didn't even know that.''
   And was he bothered by it?
   ``No, no, no,'' Sampras replied, recovering in time to prove
just how cool he really is. ``My phone was off the hook.''

<HEAD>Dollar Strengthens in Europe: Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar, bolstered by superpower accord on the
Persian Gulf, rose against most major currencies in early European
trading today. Gold prices fell.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's strength to the united position
on the gulf crisis taken by the U.S. and Soviet leaders at their
weekend meeting in Helsinki. They predicted further gains against
major European currencies in later trading.
   In Frankfurt, traders said the German mark was weakened by news
that Germany will not gain sovereignty immediately on the Oct. 3
unification date because the four World War II allies are unlikely
to have ratified the accord by then.
   ``It's looking bad for the D-mark,'' said Claus Wagner, chief
trader at Citibank in Frankfurt. ``I really believe we've seen the
worst for the dollar. If a currency is going to weaken, it's the
mark.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 139.43 Japanese yen, down
from 140.25 at Friday's close. Later in London, the yen fell to
139.20 yen.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. A pound
cost $1.8700, cheaper than $1.8933 late Friday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.5760 German marks, up from 1.5665
   _1.3105 Swiss francs, up from 1.3055
   _5.2782 French francs, up from 5.2465
   _1.7695 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7653
   _1,175.50 Italian lire, up from 1,168.50
   _1.1640 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1633
   Gold dealers in London put the metal's early weakness down to a
more relaxed outlook on the Middle East crisis following the
superpower summit and the stronger dollar.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$382.50 at midmorning, down from $386.75 late Friday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $382.250, down from $387 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.45 an ounce to close at a
bid $384.56.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price $4.75 a troy ounce, from
Friday's $4.80.

   Police firing tear gas clashed
today with rock-hurling blacks after 49 people were killed in
weekend battles in black townships between rival factions that
fought with guns and knives.
   In Katlehong township today, police backed by soldiers fought
with local youths, police said. The independent South African Press
Association said at least seven people were shot and two stabbed,
but gave no further details.
   The weekend unrest began in Soweto when armed men attacked a
squatter camp Saturday night, killing at least 13 people, and
residents later battled police.
   A police spokesman said today that 33 people had been killed in
Soweto, the sprawling black township southwest of Johannesburg.
   The officers said that in township violence since Saturday seven
people were killed in Vosloorus, five in Tokoza, two in Katlehong
and one each in Everton and Tembiza.
   In addition to the 49 people killed near Johannesburg, police
said four people were killed in weekend factional violence in Natal
and three in Orange Free State.
   Police said they had no reports of police killing any protesters
and all the dead appeared to have been killed in factional fighting.
   The dead in Vosloorus included a municipal police officer who
was gunned down Saturday night, the spokesman said.
   Police commanders said today that police and army reinforcements
had been moved into the townships to help restore order. Soldiers
were deployed in the townships late last month to aid police.
   The latest fighting raised the death toll from a month of
violence in black townships around Johannesburg to at least 650
killed.
   The fighting has largely pitted Xhosas and other blacks loyal to
the African National Congress to Zulus tied to the conservative
Inkatha party. The two sides oppose apartheid, but differ over
leadership and plans for a future South Africa.
   Witnesses said the fighting began Saturday night when Inkatha
fighters attacked the Tladi squatter camp in Soweto.
   Johannesburg newspapers reported today that residents in Soweto
claimed whites armed with guns aided Inkatha fighters in the attack
on the Tladi camp. Similar claims have been made during fighting
over the past week.
   Police said they were investigating the charges.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela told a meeting of the Organization of
African Unity in Uganda that South Africa would be ``drowned in
blood'' unless the government took steps to end the violence.
   Mandela told the meeting Saturday that police had played a role
in starting violence. He also said the growing violence threatened
to derail talks between the ANC and the government on ending white
minority rule.
   The ANC and President F.W. de Klerk's government are preparing
for talks, expected early next year, on sharing political power
with the black majority. De Klerk has promised to end apartheid.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two Germanys are increasingly preoccupied
with the skeletons in their closets just three weeks before they
move into the same house.
   East Germany's interior minister said in an interview that both
nations are still spying on each other, and West German lawmakers
are split over a plan to grant amnesty to former East German spies.
   A top West German official was quoted today as saying 3,800 East
German spies are still active in West Germany, with many eluding
detection and some going to work for the Soviet KGB.
   Meanwhile, activists and politicians are trying to keep secret
files maintained by the East German intelligence service from being
turned over to the West German intelligence service.
   The hand-wringing over espionage has been increasing as the Oct.
3 date of German unification moves closer. German media generate
stories daily about double agents, infiltrations and the notorious
deeds of East Germany's former Communist secret police.
   The two nations that were once the front line of the Cold War
also comprised perhaps the biggest arena for East-West espionage.
   East German Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel raised the
debate another notch Sunday when he was quoted as saying that West
Germany still has moles in East German ministries.
   Diestel also said there are ``quite a lot'' of East German spies
in Bonn, the West German capital, and that it was time for both
countries to ``switch off their surveillance.''
   Lutz Stavenhagen, who coordinates anti-espionage policy for
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, denied that West Germany was still spying
on East Germany, the Cologne newspaper ``Express'' reported today.
   But Stavenhagen said the Soviet Union had been trying to recruit
East German intelligence agents working in West Germany. He
characterized most of the estimated 3,800 agents as unimportant,
according to the paper.
   Diestel, meanwhile, has come under renewed fire by East German
activists for keeping scores of former Communist secret police
agents on his payroll.
   Some of the activists who helped oust the Communist government
last year have occupied the former headquarters of the East German
secret police.
   They are demanding that former agents be purged from the
democratic government and that ordinary East Germans get to see the
files that were kept on them by the once-feared domestic
intelligence unit.
   They also are demanding that the records not be turned over to
the West German intelligence agency.
   ``The one thing we don't need is the records going from one
secret agency to another secret agency,'' said Hans Schenke, one of
about 22 activists who have been occupying the headquarters of the
secret police since Tuesday.
   Two weeks ago, the East German Parliament threatened to reject a
treaty laying the foundation for German unity unless West Germany
allowed the files to remain in what is now East Germany. The
all-German parliament that takes over after unification will decide
what should be done with them.
   In West Germany, political parties are feuding over a plan to
grant amnesty to many of the East German spies in West Germany.
   Lawmakers in the past several days have been debating a proposal
by the West German Justice Ministry that would grant amnesty as
long as the operatives were not involved in murder, blackmail or
other nefarious activities.
   But politicians have been unable to decide how broad the plan
should be, whether it should include West Germans charged with
treason or West German peace disarmanent activists who may have
been East German secret police operatives.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
briefed NATO allies today on the superpower summit in Helsinki,
seeking greater assistance in the international campaign against
Iraq.
   Baker and other foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization nations met for about two hours to discuss the summit
between President George Bush and his Soviet counterpart Mikhail
Gorbachev on Sunday in the Finnish capital.
   Greater allied assistance in the campaign against Iraq was on
today's agenda.
   The 12 European Community nations said in Rome on Friday that
they would not help pay for the U.S. military presence. But the EC
did agree to provide economic aid to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey,
three frontline states hit hardest by the crisis.
   Baker was to meet with EC Commission President Jacques Delors at
the trade bloc's Brussels headquarters following the NATO briefing.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Baker
would ask the NATO allies for more money for Egypt, Jordan and
Turkey, not to fund the American military effort.
   ``We have not made a request for financial aid to the U.S. and
we are not going to make that request,'' the official said in
Brussels. ``We had a request for financial aid to the frontline
states and of course, the Europeans dealt with that in Rome.''
   The Iraqi sanctions and refugee aid could cost the three
frontline states some $3.5 billion by the end of this year, U.S.
officials have said, and the costs could climb by an additional $7
billion in 1991.
   The added U.S. costs in military operations in the Persian Gulf
are expected to stand at $6 billion at the end of the year.
   The American official said he expected Baker to repeat his call
for cargo ships and planes from the NATO allies to beef up the
military presence in the Gulf.
   ``I am sure that he will reinforce the earlier request of last
week for sealift and airlift capability,'' he said. NATO observers
said the United States was disappointed with the initial response
of some of its allies to the appeal.
   Britain, Italy and Portugal already have offered planes and
vessels to take U.S. troops to the Gulf.
   Britain and France have built up their military presence in the
Gulf region and smaller allies like the Netherlands and Belgium
also have warships on the way to help enforce a U.N. trade embargo
against Iraq.
   Bush and Gorbachev said after their summit Sunday that they were
``united in the belief that Iraq's aggression must not be
tolerated.''
   Gorbachev said his former ally, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
is headed ``into a dead end'' in struggling to hold occupied Kuwait
against the insistence of the United Nations that his forces
withdraw.

<TEXT>
   Liberian President Samuel K. Doe took power in a violent coup a
decade ago and left power in the same manner.
   His capture Sunday by fighters loyal to rebel leader Prince
Johnson comes 8{ months after insurgents began their battle to
unseat him. The civil war has claimed more than 5,000 lives and
re-opened the ethnic divisions that Doe used to take power.
   Sixty-four people, including many of Doe's bodyguards, were
killed in the battle Sunday, the British Broadcasting Corp. said.
Doe was reported wounded in both legs. The fight took place outside
the headquarters of the West African task force sent to end the
country's civil war.
   Doe claimed he had thwarted 30 attempts to topple him since
April 12, 1980, when he led a band of 17 sergeants who ended
domination of this West African nation by the descendants of freed
American slaves.
   Doe, son of an army private, personally led the charge into the
executive mansion of President William Tolbert, who was killed. The
sergeants publicly executed 13 other prominent Americo-Liberians
several days later.
   Born in blood, Doe's rule was characterized by numerous murders
and detentions of opposition leaders and suppression of the
country's press.
   In August 1981 he had five of his closest associates shot for
allegedly planning a coup against him. Later a president guard
commander was executed in similar circumstances.
   After more than five years of military rule Doe permitted
elections in 1985. The election rules Doe had approved required
presidential candidates to be at least 35 years old.
   His official biography listed his birthdate as May 6, 1952. The
year was scratched out, 1950 written in, and the biography handed
out to reporters.
   When opposition parties appeared to have won the Oct. 15, 1985
voting, Doe's men burned and destroyed ballots. The election
commission Doe had appointed declared him the winner.
   On Nov. 12, 1985, another former close associate, a sergeant who
like Doe had been named a general after the revolution, attacked
Monrovia. His men took over local radio stations and appeared to
control the city before Doe counterattacked.
   At least 1,500 people were estimated to have died. Brig. Gen.
Thomas Quiwonkpa, who led the coup attempt, reportedly was
disemboweled after being captured.
   Quiwonkpa had been a popular commander from Nimba County and his
killing made his home area a fertile base for the Dec. 24, 1989
invasion of Liberia by rebel leader Charles Taylor.
   Doe, in announcing he would not seek another term as president,
said he has survived 35 or 36 coup attempts and would be happy to
leave the ``burden of leading a country ... the political
harassment'' to someone else.
   The former master sergeant, described by foes as impulsive and
by friends as brave, visited the scene of a bloody assault by his
own troops on refugees in Monrovia. He met with victims and
promised to help them, and vowed to executed the masked soldiers
who had committed the attack.
   ``Remember that tough times don't last, only tough people do,''
Doe once said at a news conference.
   By all economic standards the country has declined sharply since
Doe took power. But it was already broke when he arrived. It had
huge budget deficit and a foreign debt of $800 million.
   The goal of his revolution had largely been simply to end the
rule of the elite descendants of American slaves. He also wanted
better pay and conditions for soldiers.
   Doe worked hard, taking college classes, speech tutoring, and
shifting from army fatigues to a three-piece suit.
   Since July, Doe had been holed up in his mansion as street
fighting raged in the capital. His troops _ many of them members of
his Krahn tribe _ reportedly refused to let him flee without
obtaining assurances for their own safety.
   The rebels have accused Doe of nepotism and stealing millions of
dollars of state money. They also hold him responsible for the
deaths of thousands of civilians killed during the civil war.

   Opening night at the San Francisco Opera
was rescheduled for Saturday after the opera's management and its
orchestra union reached a tentative contract agreement, a spokesman
said today.
   ``The opera association is delighted that there is this
agreement and we look forward to doing what we do best, which is
providing opera,'' spokesman Jon Finck said.
   The settlement was reached late Sunday, two days after the
season's opening night had been scrubbed because of the labor
dispute.
   The orchestra was due back in rehearsal today for the first time
since its contract expired Aug. 20 and the opera locked the
69-musician ensemble out of the War Memorial Opera House.
   Orchestra union officials, however, weren't so pleased as opera
officials with the settlement, reached after three days of intense
negotiations. Talks had stalled Sept. 2 but were renewed Friday at
the urging of Mayor Art Agnos.
   The tentative settlement provides musicians with a 4.5 percent
raise the first two years of the contract and a 5 percent raise in
the third year, said Joanne Eisler, a clarinetist and chairwoman of
the union's negotiating committee.
   ``We are sad,'' she said. ``We had to fight hard to get so
little.''
   Musicians had sought a raise of 4 percent the first year, 8
percent the second and 10 percent the third.
   The tentative contract agreement will be put to a vote Tuesday.
   The postponed season will begin with a performance of
``Rigoletto.''

<HEAD>Bomb Explodes At Army Recruiting Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DERBY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb ripped through the roof of a
military recruiting center in the main shopping precinct of this
northwest England city today, badly damaging an adjacent building,
police reported.
   No one was seriously injured in the explosion, police said. One
woman was taken to a hospital suffering from shock.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But suspicion
fell on the Irish Republican Army, which has attacked at least
seven military establishments in England this year, killing one
sergeant and injuring a dozen people.
   ``It felt like an earthquake going off,'' said Barbara
Beresford, manager of a shop near the recruiting center. ``There
was glass raining down and I saw people thrown to the ground.''
   Police said seven staff were employed in the building in Derby's
shopping precinct.
   The worst damage, witnesses said, was at the back of the
recruiting center and to a seven-storey building adjoining it.
   Anti-terrorist officers were called to Derby, 130 miles from
London, and bomb disposal experts picked through debris and the
scoured the building for a possible second device.
   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
bomb contained two to five pounds of explosives.
   In their most serious recent attack, IRA guerrillas killed
legislator Ian Gow, a close associate of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and chairman of the Northern Ireland Committee in the
House of Commons. He died in a car bomb blast July 30.
   The overwhelmingly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British
rule in Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite it with the
Republic of Ireland.

<TEXT>
   Michigan Democrats embraced their new
nominee for lieutenant governor and honored the party's departing
candidate in the hopes of ending a bitter dispute.
   Chanting ``Libby, Libby, Libby,'' delegates at the state party
convention Sunday nominated Olivia Maynard, 54, of Flint as their
candidate to succeed two-term Lt. Gov. Martha Griffiths.
   The 78-year-old former congresswoman was booted from the ticket
last month by Gov. James Blanchard, 48, who said he feared
Griffiths was no longer able to step in as governor at a moment's
notice.
   Griffiths skipped Sunday's convention. She had asked that a
tribute to her be canceled, saying she said did not want to listen
to hypocrites honoring her.
   Delegates hugged and kissed Maynard, a former chairwoman of the
state's Democratic Party, as she made her way to the platform.
   ``Libby Maynard is a person who meets Jim Blanchard's primary
test of being someone who can assume the office of governor,'' said
Macomb County Prosecutor Carl Marlinga.
   ``Her career is a model of competence and caring,'' he said.
   Maynard said she wanted to campaign about good-paying jobs,
abortion rights, better schools and care for the elderly.
   Though Griffiths stayed away, delegates stood and applauded when
Sen. Don Riegle of Michigan said she would be a tough act to follow.
   ``Our party and our country owes a great debt to Martha
Griffiths for her many decades of extraordinary leadership and
accomplishment,'' he said.
   ``I don't believe that a single other national leader has done
more to advance the cause of women's rights in this country, and
every man and every woman and every child in this country owes much
to her.''
   As a U.S. representative, Griffiths was instrumental in adding
provisions barring sex discrimination to the civil rights laws and
in prying the Equal Rights Amendment from a balky House committee.
The amendment failed to be ratified by enough states.
   Griffiths had questioned Maynard's qualifications, saying she
had never served in elective office and had no government
experience except running a state office for the aging office.
   Griffiths later said she meant Maynard had no parliamentary
experience and predicted Maynard would do a wonderful job.
   Maynard said she prefers to believe Griffiths' later comments
were her true feelings.
   Blanchard declined to comment on Griffiths' remarks about
Maynard when he appeared at a post-convention news conference.
   ``That's all behind us,'' he said.

   Fourteen runaway rail cars from a
Southern Pacific switching yard rolled eight miles and collided
with four locomotives, knocking train cars into a neighborhood and
damaging a home, officials said.
   No one was injured Sunday, but nine of the cars jumped the track
and one landed inches from a home where a couple and their two
children were having breakfast, Los Angeles County Fire Chief
Michael Freeman said.
   ``Luck was on Pico Rivera's side today,'' said Los Angeles
County sheriff's Sgt. Shirley Sherman. Pico Rivera is about 13
miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
   The accident started a brief fire and knocked out power in the
area, officials said. Two dozen families were evacuated while
workers inspected gas lines.
   The cars broke free after they were apparently improperly
connected to a locomotive in a switching yard in the nearby city of
Industry, and rolled onto a Union Pacific track, said Andy
Anderson, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Southern Pacific.
   John Jenkins, a Southern Pacific field superintendent, declined
to comment on how the freight cars came loose.

   Nordstrom, a Seattle-based department store chain, gave Love a

<TEXT>
   A $250,000 contract has been ordered to kill a
terminally ill woman scheduled to testify for the prosecution at a
heroin and cocaine trial that begins this week, according to a
published report today.
   Law enforcement authorities last week discovered the plot
against Susan Chang, a witness in a case against seven people
accused of running a Lower East Side drug operation that brought in
$4.5 million a year, New York Newsday said.
   ``They want Susan dead and they want her 7-year-old son dead,
too,'' Newsday quoted one unidentified law enforcement official as
saying.
   Chang, 39, is an informant in a case against members of the
``Stanton Street'' drug ring of which she once was a member,
according to court documents.
   She was arrested in February 1989 and turned against fellow gang
members after spending two weeks in jail. She agreed to be a
confidential informant after she learned she had breast cancer and
had less than two years to live, she told Newsday last month.
   Prosecutors offered her five years' probation in exchange for
information and her promise to testify against other members of the
gang. The state has also agreed to pay for her funeral arrangements.
   The fact that she had become an informant against her former
colleagues was revealed in open court March 16.
   The seven defendants are all charged with conspiracy to sell
drugs.

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Nicolae Ceausescu's
despised Securitate secret police went on trial before three
military judges today on a charge of complicity in mass murder.
   A 28-page indictment read out at the opening of the court
session charged that 52-year-old Iulian Vlad had ``assisted
genocide in his position as head of the security department.''
   ``All the orders regarding the activity of the troops of
Securitate were given by him,'' the indictment said.
   Vlad, who has been in custody since March, faces 20 years in
prison if found guilty. The trial likely will last for months.
   But the trial was adjourned until Tuesday shortly after the
proceedings began to give Vlad more time to acquaint himself with
the charges.
   The military court presided over by Gen. Adrian Nitoiu also
rejected a bid to have Vlad's case joined to that of 23 former
officials of Ceausescu's administration, top aides and members of
his Politburo.
   Vlad held the position of chief of six directorates of
Securitate from 1987 until the December 1989 revolution and
commanded about 25,000 troops.
   According to the latest official statistics, at least 1,038
people were killed and 2,198 injured in the revolution that ended
with the execution of Ceausescu and his wife Elena on Christmas Day.
   The indictment quoted Vlad as telling Ceausescu in two Politburo
teleconferences preceding the dictator's ouster: ``I assure you,
comrade general secretary, that I will do my best to be worthy of
your faithfulness.''
   It also charged that Vlad ordered troops into the western city
of Timisoara, where the demonstrations that led to the revolution
first broke out, with the intent of ``suppressing the revolutionary
movement.''
   The request to join Vlad's trial to that of the 23 other
officials was made by defense lawyers for former Vice Premier
Gheorghe Oprea, who said that Vlad could not be judged separately
from the officials charged with forming the policies he allegedly
carried out.
   Dressed in a dark-gray suit, and guarded by two white-helmeted
police, Vlad occasionally exchanged glances with two of his defense
lawyers.
   He currently is being held in the hospital of Jilava jail south
of Bucharest, recovering from a gall bladder operation he underwent
three months ago. But defense lawyer Gheorghe Vilcu said his client
had recovered from surgery.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
today asked NATO allies to send ground troops into the Persian Gulf
region to boost the military buildup and heighten pressure on Iraq
to withdraw from Kuwait.
   ``He made this request for additional ground forces'' at a
meeting of NATO foreign ministers to discuss the weekend
U.S.-Soviet summit, said NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner.
   ``There was no decision reached on that but obviously that was
not the intention,'' he said after the two-hour meeting.
   A British official, who asked not to be named, said his
government would ``give active consideration'' to the U.S. request.
   Other allies appeared more hesitant to make a commitment.
   The 12 European Community nations said in Rome on Friday that
they would not help pay for the U.S. military presence. But the EC
did agree to provide economic aid to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey,
three frontline states hit hardest by the crisis.
   Baker was to meet with EC Commission President Jacques Delors at
the trade bloc's Brussels headquarters following the NATO briefing.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Baker
would ask the NATO allies for more money for Egypt, Jordan and
Turkey, not to fund the American military effort.
   ``We have not made a request for financial aid to the U.S. and
we are not going to make that request,'' the official said in
Brussels. ``We had a request for financial aid to the frontline
states and of course, the Europeans dealt with that in Rome.''
   The Iraqi sanctions and refugee aid could cost the three
frontline states some $3.5 billion by the end of this year, U.S.
officials have said, and the costs could climb by an additional $7
billion in 1991.
   The added U.S. costs in military operations in the Persian Gulf
are expected to stand at $6 billion at the end of the year.
   The American official said he expected Baker to repeat his call
for cargo ships and planes from the NATO allies to beef up the
military presence in the Gulf.
   ``I am sure that he will reinforce the earlier request of last
week for sealift and airlift capability,'' he said. NATO observers
said the United States was disappointed with the initial response
of some of its allies to the appeal.
   Britain, Italy and Portugal already have offered planes and
vessels to take U.S. troops to the Gulf.
   Britain and France have built up their military presence in the
Gulf region and smaller allies like the Netherlands and Belgium
also have warships on the way to help enforce a U.N. trade embargo
against Iraq.
   Bush and Gorbachev said after their summit Sunday that they were
``united in the belief that Iraq's aggression must not be
tolerated.''
   Gorbachev said his former ally, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
is headed ``into a dead end'' in struggling to hold occupied Kuwait
against the insistence of the United Nations that his forces
withdraw.

   President Bush, back from his brief summit
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, hailed their ``loud and
clear'' condemnation of Iraq's Saddam Hussein and prepared to
address the American people for the first time since sending troops
to the Middle East.
   Bush brushed aside lingering differences with the Soviet leader,
including Gorbachev's reluctance to go along with the U.S. threat
of force if sanctions fail to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
Gorbachev also set aside U.S. concerns about the presence in Iraq
of Soviet military advisers.
   ``Nobody said that the United States and the Soviet Union agreed
with every nuance or every question,'' Bush said. ``But on this one
it is loud and clear, and if you missed that, you are missing
something really important.''
   Bush spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One as he made the
eight-hour flight back to Washington Sunday night from Helsinki,
Finland, and his third meeting as president with the Soviet leader.
   The president's next step is an address Tuesday night to a
televised joint session of Congress to discuss his Persian Gulf
policy and the summit. Bush has dispatched more than 100,000 U.S.
forces to Saudi Arabia in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium today, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, asked the allies to send ground troops to
the Persian Gulf area to add pressure on Iraq, but the alliance
made no decision, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said.
   ``He made this request for additional ground forces,'' Woerner
said. A British official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
his government would ``give active consideration'' to the U.S.
request. Other allies seemed more reluctant to make a commitment.
   Also in Brussels today, Baker announced he will visit Syria on
Thursday to meet with President Hafez Assad to discuss the U.S.
drive against Iraq. Baker also told reporters that Saudi Arabia,
the United Arab Emirates and the government of Kuwait would
contribute a combined $12 billion to help defray the cost of the
U.S. buildup in the gulf and to assist poorer nations hurt by the
UN boycott of Iraq.
   In Britain, meanwhile, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher hailed
the outcome of the Helsinki summit, saying Saddam must ``now feel
very isolated indeed.'' Also, Kuwait's displaced prime minister,
Saad al-Abdallah al-Sabah, said in Paris, ``The whole world's
happy'' that the superpowers are united in condemning Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait.
   Gorbachev returned to Moscow after the summit, which included
six hours of talks between the two leaders at the Finnish
Presidential Palace followed by a joint hour-long press conference.
About half the meeting time was spent between just the two
presidents, joined only by note-takers and translators.
   The two released a joint statement criticizing the invasion of
Kuwait by Iraq, declaring, ``No peaceful international order is
possible if larger states can devour their smaller neighbors.''
   ``We are determined to see this aggression end, and if the
current steps fail to end it, we are prepared to consider
additional ones consistent with the U.N. charter,'' the statement
said. ``We must demonstrate beyond any doubt that aggression cannot
and will not pay.''
   The statement did not describe those additional steps.
   Sections of the U.N. charter authorize force in extreme cases.
But Gorbachev made it clear that a military response was not what
he had in mind and asserted there was ``a whole range of
possibilities of finding a political solution.''
   Though the potential use of force remained a difference, Bush
said their agreement opposing Iraq's invasion and endorsing the
economic sanctions against Iraq was the key element.
   ``There are some differences, but not on the fundamental
point,'' Bush said on his way home. ``The fundamental point is
there is a clarion call for compliance with these sanctions.''
   The joint statement, he said, ``is going to send a very strong
statement around the world, and I couldn't be more pleased.''
   He said he hoped to see Gorbachev again later this year or
``early next year,'' whenever treaties on reducing conventional
forces in Europe and on limiting strategic arms are ready to be
signed.
   Bush seemed to imply he was less than optimistic about chances
of getting either treaty signed this year. Asked about the
prospects of treaty signings, he said: ``Well, I hope so. I don't
know. I can't guarantee it.''
   Although Bush declared the two countries were ``standing
shoulder to shoulder'' in demanding the unconditional end of the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, clear differences remained on several
issues:
   _ Gorbachev said he did not plan to remove the remaining 150
Soviet military advisers from Iraq. Bush said their removal ``would
facilitate things.''
   _ Bush said that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was unrelated
to the Iraqi crisis even though it was one that must ``eventually
be resolved.'' Gorbachev suggested there was a link and that ``we
need to act more energetically'' to resolve both Middle East
problems.
   Still, Bush said, ``common ground surges ahead of these
differences.''
   At their news conference in Helsinki's Finlandia Hall, both
leaders said they hoped their solidarity would help persuade Saddam
to end the occupation of his smaller neighbor.
   Although the Soviets have been leery of the massive buildup of
U.S. troops in the region and have declined to send forces to Saudi
Arabia, the final summit statement sidestepped a direct stand on an
increased military response.
   White House aides were delighted with Gorbachev's direct
criticism of Saddam.
   Gorbachev told the news conference he had criticized the Iraqi
leader in private just as he had done in public. Saddam's actions
are driving Iraq ``into a dead end,'' the Soviet leader declared.
   The Soviet Union and Iraq have long been allies. Until the
crisis, Moscow had been Baghdad's principal arms supplier.
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union did not plan to send ground
forces to Saudi Arabia to join the U.S.-led multinational force.
Bush said he had not made such a request.
   In a conciliatory gesture, Bush said the United States was ready
to explore ways to help the hard-pressed Soviet economy. Last July
at the economic summit of the world's seven largest industrial
democracies in Houston, the administration opposed such help.
   Bush said later on the plane there were ``no secret agreements''
at the summit, and that other issues _ such as arms limitation
negotiations _ were barely mentioned.
   ``I couldn't ask for any more out of a statement than what we
got,'' Bush said.
   It was the first time the two superpowers had spoken in tandem
on a major international issue since World War II. ``It was very
successful for what we were trying to do,'' Bush said.
   The joint statement called on Iraq to ``withdraw unconditionally
from Kuwait, to allow the restoration of Kuwait's legitimate
government, and to free all hostages now held in Iraq and Kuwait.''
   It also said shipments of food and medical supplies for
humanitarian purposes into Iraq should be closely monitored by the
U.N. and other appropriate international agencies ``to ensure that
food reaches only those for whom it is intended.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
announced today he will visit Syria to coordinate the U.S. drive
against Iraq with President Hafez Assad, despite differences with
the Syrian government over human rights and terrorism.
   Baker also reported that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
and the overthrown government of Kuwait would contribute $12
billion to help pay for the U.S. defense of the Persian Gulf and
assist nations hurt financially by their adherence to a boycott of
Iraq.
   Baker said President Bush had directed him to go to Damascus
Thursday night after he winds up talks in Moscow with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze.
   ``The president felt it was an important time to have a
face-to-face dialogue,'' Baker said.
   Syria, in a makeshift alliance with the United States, has sent
troops to Saudi Arabia and to the United Arab Emirates to guard
their oil fields against an Iraqi attack.
   ``We continue to have some differences with Syria and we expect
to discuss those differences,'' Baker said.
   Over the years, the State Department has sharply condemned
Syria's domestic human rights record and accused it of sponsoring
terrorism against American and Israeli civilians.
   Meanwhile, Baker told a news conference, he spoke by telephone
with the ambassadors of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
and received word that they, along with the overthrown Kuwait
monarchy, will contribute $12 billion to the economic and military
campaign against Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   While touring the Persian Gulf last week, Baker received
commitments of aid _ without specific amounts _ from King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia and President Zayid of the United Arab Emirates. Emir
Jabir al Sabah of the displaced Kuwaiti government offered $6
billion.
   Baker said roughly half of the $12 billion total would go to
offset American efforts in the gulf, which include the presence of
U.S. troops. The other half would assist poorer nations observing
the boycott of Iraq.
   The Bush administration reached out to both Syria and Iran to
join the campaign against Iraq, relying on their bitter differences
with Saddam Hussein.
   However, the official Iranian news agency reported today that
Iran has agreed to establish diplomatic relations with Iraq, ending
a decade-old conflict with Saddam.
   A U.S. official said Baker had no plans to meet with Iranian
representatives.
   Baker held the news conference after briefing foreign ministers
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the summit Bush and
Gorbachev held Sunday in Helsinki, Finland. Baker asked the NATO
ministers to send ground troops to Saudi Arabia and to assist
Turkey and front-line Arab states.
   ``We will not be embracing Syria and everything Syria has done
with which we disagree,'' Baker said. Pressed further on why he was
going to Damascus, Baker replied, ``They are there.''
   He said it was important to show the extent to which Iraq is
isolated. He made no mention of Iraq's reported resumption of
diplomatic ties with Iran. The two countries had a bloody
eight-year war in the Persian Gulf.
   Asked if the United States would welcome Iranian help, Baker
said: ``You bet we would.''
   The United States has no relations with Iran while maintaining
ties with Syria.
   The estimated U.S. cost of defending the Gulf this year is $6
billion.
   Of the 16 NATO nations only the United States, Turkey, Britain
and France have troops in the region.
   Others have contributed ships to move troops. Eight countries,
meanwhile, are holding exercises in the Mediterranean.
   Baker said he suggested they extend their operations eastward _
closer to the crisis area.
   Manfred Woerner, the NATO secretary-general, said ``there was a
unanimous conviction more can and should be done'' by the allies to
support the United States. But Woerner stressed it would be up to
each nation to decide what to do.
   The State Department in its annual human rights reports
consistently has criticized Syria's domestic practices while the
Office of Counter-terrorism has implicated Palestinian groups
operating out of the Syria-controlled Bekaa Valley of Lebanon in
attacks on Americans and Israelis.
   One such incident was the bombing of a Pan Am passenger plane
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, The Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine _ General Command, which is maintained
by Syria, is suspected of the attack.
   The group also faces charges in West Germany of attempting to
blow up troop trains carrying Americans.

   Her opponents are determined to have
Benazir Bhutto remembered as the disgraced leader of Pakistan's
most corrupt and incompetent government, not as a martyr for
democracy.
   When she was dismissed after 20 months in office, they set out
to destroy what some called ``the myth'' _ that only a Bhutto could
govern Pakistan.
   In removing the prime minister and her democratically elected
government Aug. 6, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan cited a long list of
complaints ranging from corruption and ineptitude to abuse of power.
   Ms. Bhutto called it ``a constitutional coup'' by the
Establishment, a reference to the generals who formerly ruled
Pakistan and still have enormous influence.
   A caretaker government made up largely of defected allies and
bitter critics of Ms. Bhutto has hurled charge after charge to an
effort to discredit her Pakistan People's Party, which was founded
by her father. Some say her enemies are trying to force her out of
politics.
   Three former Cabinet ministers have been charged in special
courts set up to handle corruption cases and to disqualify
candidates from elections called for Oct. 24, three years ahead of
schedule.
   Today, the army-backed caretaker government charged Ms. Bhutto
with corruption, the first step toward possibly barring her from
next month's election. She was charged before a special one-judge
court set up in Karachi to try cases of official graft and
disqualify candidates from the scheduled Oct. 24 elections.
   Judge Wajihuddin Ahmed will decide later this week whether to
accept the charges and serve formal notice to Ms. Bhutto.
   Many Pakistanis see the tribunals as ``kangaroo courts'' evoking
memories of the process her father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, underwent 13 years ago after Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq
overthrew him. Bhutto was hanged two years later.
   ``There are glaring similarities with 1977, but there also are
differences,'' Ms. Bhutto said in a recent interview at her
fortress-like home in Karachi. ``The wind of democracy has come
across the world. There is a new future ahead, and it will not be
easy for them to drag Pakistan backward.''
   Opponents have not presented concrete evidence to support their
charges, and the family name still carries much of its old magic
for many. Wherever she goes, Ms. Bhutto draws large crowds that
chant ``Benazir, Benazir is innocent!''
   Pakistanis have become increasingly cynical about the future of
their stop-and-start democracy.
   Since its creation as a Moslem homeland 43 years ago, when the
Indian subcontinent became independent of Britain, Pakistan has
endured three wars, three internal insurgencies and three military
dictators.
   Two prime ministers, a president, several high-ranking generals
and countless politicians and religious leaders have been
assassinated. Thirteen governments have been dismissed and three
constitutions written.
   ``Many are wondering whether there is something sick, something
terminal festering deep down in the political soul of Pakistan,''
said political analyst Akbar Ahmed. ``It is a cycle of despair,
military rule and terror, civilian rule and anarchy.''
   Nobody said it would be easy to lead this volatile country of
110 million out of the social and economic problems a decade of
martial law created, but never was such a legacy of admiration and
goodwill squandered so swiftly.
   Ms. Bhutto _ just 37 years old, inexperienced and
Western-educated _ pursued a policy of confrontation rather than
compromise. Opponents considered her arrogant and vindictive, and
spared no effort to bring her down.
   In her eagerness to become prime minister, she promised to share
power with the president and the army chief of staff, Gen. Mirza
Aslam Beg. She tried to play one against the other, but they united
against her.
   She infuriated Beg by meddling in army promotions, something she
promised not to do. Her policy on Kashmir was unclear and her
public statements of support for militant Moslems in the disputed
territory antagonized India, Pakistan's hostile neighbor.
   She displayed only nominal interest in finding a peaceful
settlement to the 12-year-old civil war in neighboring Afghanistan
and helping nearly 4 million Afghan refugees return home from
Pakistan.
   She appears to have tolerated corruption and greed among senior
ministers and allegedly allowed her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, to
plunder state-run banks, dole out public jobs and demand
commissions on lucrative government contracts.
   The last straw was a breakdown of law and order, especially in
southern Sindh province, Ms. Bhutto's home and power base.
   ``People in the villages expect corruption and arrogance from
the rich and powerful, but they also expect security and
sympathy,'' said Ahmed, the political analyst. ``When social order
is disrupted and kidnappings and senseless killings become
commonplace, the equation is disturbed.''
   When warfare broke out between rival ethnic groups in late May,
taking hundreds of lives, Ms. Bhutto showed little reaction. The
army, called in to restore order, was greeted as a savior.
   Close friends and associates warned Ms. Bhutto that the
president was going to use his constitutional power and dismiss her
government, but she did not believe them.
   Ms. Bhutto acknowledges her former ministers ``are not all
angels'' but makes no apologies. She denies wrongdoing and paints a
picture of an administration that improved the nation's lot.
   ``I have no regrets; I was not betrayed by the people,'' she
said. ``Given half the chance, I am sure the people will elect us.''

   The Iraqi government has denied requests by
the International Committee of the Red Cross to aid foreign
hostages and other foreigners in Iraq and occupied Kuwait, the
committee said today.
   Cornelio Sommaruga, ICRC president, expressed regret that the
Red Cross was not being allowed to carry out its humanitarian
mandate, spokeswoman Ann Stingle said.
   She said Sommaruga met Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and other
Iraqi officials during a three-day visit to Baghdad last week.
   The Red Cross sought access to foreign nationals being held
against their will in Iraq or Kuwait and permission to assist
foreigners allowed to leave who lack the means to do so. No reason
was given for Iraq's rejection of the Red Cross requests.
   ``We support the neutral role of the ICRC in protecting and
assisting victims of conflict within the framework of the Geneva
conventions and hope that they will soon be allowed to carry out
their mandate,'' said Stephen H. Richards, executive vice president
of the American Red Cross.
   Under the Geneva conventions, the Red Cross has the right to
assist foreign nationals displaced by international conflicts and
to ensure that prisoners of war are not being mistreated.
   Ms. Stingle said, ``Kuwait is definitely a fourth Geneva
Convention situation because it is an occupied country.''
   Sommaruga also traveled to Amman, Jordan, and Tehran to
coordinate Red Cross operations to aid foreign refugees in Jordan.
He also discussed the repatriation of Iranian and Iraqi prisoners
of war.

   Florida's Lotto jackpot should hit a
record $75 million, and perhaps even more, by the time of the next
drawing Saturday, officials said.
   ``We've set this week's jackpot estimate at $75 million, but the
sky's the limit,'' Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul said in a
statement Sunday.
   There were no lines at some Tallahassee lottery outlets Sunday,
but clerks said there were seeing more Lotto players than normal
for a typical Sunday.
   ``It's been pretty constant, pretty steady all day,'' said Jimmy
Henry, at one Sing Food Store.
   ``A $75 million jackpot probably has something to do with it,''
he added dryly.
   Florida's lottery holds the record for the largest jackpot won
by a single person. Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs, Fla., won
$55.16 million in a lottery drawing in September 1988.
   The $75 million estimated total, however, is nowhere near the
national record for a lottery prize. In April 1989, a $115 million
jackpot was awarded in Pennsylvania; there were 14 winning tickets,
some held by individuals, others by groups.
   The Lottery Department expects record sales this week and may
raise the estimated size of the grand prize before Saturday's
drawing, Mrs. Paul said.
   ``The Florida Lottery is heading into unchartered territory,''
she said.
   Saturday's drawing was worth $50 million, up $22 million from
the previous week. No player has picked the winning six numbers for
several weeks.
   Roughly 40 million tickets, or more than three for each of
Florida's 12.8 million residents, were sold last week.

   A small plane crashed in flames on a highway about
a mile from an airport, and three people aboard including a state
legislator were injured.
   Republican state Rep. Sam Johnson, 59, suffered burns over 16
percent of his body when the single-engine Piper PA-32 six-seater
crashed late Sunday on the Dallas North Tollway, authorities said.
   Johnson, who was flying the plane, was listed in fair condition
today at Parkland Memorial Hospital, said spokeswoman Sue Mundell.
He had been admitted in critical condition.
   There were no injuries on the ground.
   The plane was trying to return to Addison Airport, about 15
miles from downtown Dallas, said Department of Public Safety Sgt.
Hank Sibley.
   ``He reported that he was having mechanical problems and was
trying to re-land,'' Sibley said. ``I think they were going on a
hunting trip. They had rifles and shotguns in there.''
   Co-pilot James Melton, 55, originally was listed in serious
condition at Parkland with burns over 22 percent of his body. He
was later transferred to Zale Lipshy University Hospital in Dallas;
that hospital declined to release his condition today.
   The other victims were identified as passengers Jack Pittman of
Plano, 42, listed as fair condition today at Parkland with burns
over 12 percent of his body; and Norman Dobrich, 57, who was not
admitted.

<TEXT>
   The warring factions in Cambodia
agreed today to share power in a transitional ruling council in an
effort to end the long civil war in their country.
   The question of temporary rule has stalled the peace process in
the past.
   A joint statement issued at the end of two days of negotiations
in the Indonesian capital identified six members of Premier Hun
Sen's Cambodian government as members of the 12-seat Supreme
National Council.
   The remaining six seats are to come from the guerrilla
resistance coalition, with each faction allowed two members.
   The parties also agreed that a peace plan recently adopted by
the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council would serve
``in its entirety as the basis for settling the Cambodian
conflict.''
   The warring factions met today to discuss who will rule their
country until elections can be held. A day earlier, Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas had said that the four factions had
indicated they could accept the U.N. peace plan as a negotiating
framework.
   The plan was drawn up by the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council _ the United States, the Soviet Union, China,
France and Britain. Negotiations are now aimed at forming an
interim administration, Alatas said.
   The talks have been a series of meetings between the factions
and mediators Alatas and Edwige Avice, the French deputy foreign
minister.
   The Vietnam-installed Phnom Penh government was represented by
Premier Hun Sen. For the three rebel factions, Khieu Samphan
represented the Communist Khmer Rouge; former Premier Son Sann the
anti-Communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front; and Prince
Norodom Ranariddh the followers of his father, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk.
   Sihanouk, the head of the guerrilla coalition, said he was ill
and could not travel from Beijing for the meeting.
   In a written statement today from Beijing, Sihanouk, 67, said
his health was forcing him to take a six-month leave from politics
but he supported all decisions being made in Jakarta. The notice
did not explain the nature of Sihanouk's illness.
   Alatas said he was encouraged by the progress of the opening
session, and aksed the Cambodians to set aside their mistrust and
enmity.
   ``Anyone or any party seen to be blocking the path to peace will
have to assume an awesome responsibility before history,'' he said.
   Alatas has mediated a series of meetings since July 1988. Those
talks ended inconclusively when the four factions disagreed on how
to share power in the period before elections.
   Under the U.N. plan, Cambodian sovereignty would rest with an
interim government formed by the warring factions for the
pre-election period. But some vital powers would be held by a U.N.
peacekeeping force, which would ``supervise and control ... if
necessary'' the ministries of defense, foreign affairs, finance,
public security and information.
   The U.N. force also would verify a cease-fire and supervise
disarmament of the four factions. In a complicated disarmament
procedure, armies of the four would be regrouped in camps and
gradually relinquish their weapons to the United Nations.
   The Cambodian factions must decide the makeup of the interim
government and under what circumstances it would cede power to the
United Nations.
   Hun Sen has resisted the idea of his government giving up its
power before elections. Hun Sen conferred during a break in the
talks Sunday with John Monjo, the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia.
   It was believed to be the first high-level meeting between the
United States and Cambodia since Washington withdrew its
recognition from the resistance coalition in July.
   The resistance coalition is battling the government Vietnam
installed in Phnom Penh after it invaded in late 1978 and toppled
the Khmer Rouge.
   The Khmer Rouge had during nearly four years of rule tried to
transform Cambodia into a radical agrarian society, causing the
deaths of nearly 1 million people due mostly to starvation and
executions.

<HEAD>Abbas Hints At Terrorism In Support of Saddam Hussein</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinian terrorist leader Abul Abbas said he
welcomes a Persian Gulf war, and hinted that he might undertake
terrorist strikes on Iraq's behalf.
   In a rare interview from his Baghdad hideout, Abbas told The
Wall Street Journal that he lives only for his dream of a
Palestinian homeland and that the Persian Gulf conflict is vital to
the progress of his mission.
   ``We see this as a battle for Palestine,'' he said in the
interview, published today. ``Winning it will get us closer to
home. Losing it will put us further away.''
   Abbas, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Front, did not
explicitly threaten terrorist strikes. But when asked if terrorism
was a necessary part of Iraqi President Sadaam Hussein's struggle,
he responded, ``We use many ways to reach our aim.''
   He also quoted an Arabic saying that revenge takes 40 years.
``If not my son, then the son of my son will kill you,'' he said.
``Some day, we will have missiles that can reach New York.''
   The 41-year-old Abbas was unapologetic about his past, which
includes leadership of the 1985 Achille Lauro cruise ship hijacking
and this year's attack on a Tel Aviv beach.
   As he has before, he shrugged off the deaths of innocent
victims. ``Accidents happen,'' he said.
   He bristled at the name of Leon Klinghoffer, the American
hostage in a wheelchair who was shot in the head and pushed off the
Achille Lauro.
   ``Klinghoffer, always I hear about this Klinghoffer,'' Abbas
said. ``Nobody knows all the people who die in Palestine. But this
Klinghoffer is like Jesus Christ.''
   The Journal interview was conducted at a heavily guarded villa
in what was described as ``an anonymous neighborhood'' in Baghdad,
where Abbas has lived for several years.
   ``This is my life,'' he said at one point. ``I live only for my
dream.''
   Abbas said he still would welcome a settlement to the
Arab-Israeli conflict. But when asked if he is ready to recognize
Israel, as Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat
has done, Abbas said, ``For me, for our organization, we will not.
We want our land now and to build our state. After that we will
say.''
   As for the standoff over Iraq's takeover of Kuwait, he said, ``I
think Saddam will win, and we will win as Arabs. When we support
Iraq, we support our case as Palestinians.''

<HEAD>Politicians Claim Massacre of Tamils in Eastern District</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tamil politicians said today that at
least 15 villagers were killed by men in army uniforms in an
eastern district, but the military said it had found no evidence of
the killings.
   Kandiah Premachandran, a member of Parliament, said at least 15
Tamils were killed in the eastern Batticaloa district on Sunday. He
said the attackers were either soldiers or Moslems dressed in army
uniforms.
   Other Tamil politicians put the toll at between 30 and 35 and
said the bodies of the victims were burned by the attackers.
   Brig. Upali Seneviratne, the top army officer in the district,
said he had visisted the site of the alleged killings but had
``found nothing.''
   ``The matter is being further investigated,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Batticaloa town, 100 miles east of Colombo.
   The Batticaloa district has been the scene of reprisal killings
by Tamil rebels and Moslem militants. Scores of civilians from both
communities have been killed.
   Tamil rebels accuse Moslems of siding with the army in the civil
war for an independent Tamil homeland. Moslems claim neutrality,
but militants in the community have said they will take up arms to
defend themselves.
   At least 3,000 combatants have been killed since Tamil rebels
resumed their war against the government on June 11. Hundreds of
civilians also have died, but there are no precise estimates.
   The fighting resumed after a 13-month cease-fire in the
7-year-old war for Tamil independence.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, and
claim they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up
75 percent of the population and control the army and the
government.
   Moslems make up 7 percent of the people, and mainly live in
areas which the Tamils claim as their homeland.

<TEXT>
   Why wasn't the summit held in a sauna?
For Finns, sitting naked in a room full of hot rocks and steam is
the best way to relax and reach agreement.
   Babies have been born in saunas and old people have been taken
there to die. Finns often invite special foreign guests to their
home saunas.
   Businessmen regularly make deals in temperatures that top 125
degrees Celsius (257 degrees Fahrenheit). And President Mauno
Koivisto holds sauna evenings with politicians, journalists and
members of high society.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev held
their summit in the President's Palace here. But if the discussions
had involved only the Soviets and Finns, they might well have taken
place in a sauna.
   Bush took a sauna at the Kalastajatorppa Hotel where he spent
the night. He had planned to go jogging but a light rain persuaded
him to stay inside and take a sauna instead, aides said.
   Koivisto's predecessor, Urho Kekkonen, was famous for
entertaining Soviet leaders in the dry steam bath that originated
in Finland.
   More than 2,000 years ago, ancient Finns used saunas made of
sticks, moss and mud.
   Today's sauna can range from the small, electrically heated
cubicles in many modern apartments to the wood-heated ``smoke
sauna,'' a hot black room with no chimney, that is preferred by
connoisseurs.
   The sauna is heated by warming a stove with stones that steam
when water is thrown on them. The water is heated in a big,
brick-insulated cauldron.
   Some people spend only 10 minutes sweating in the relatively dry
steam. Others take hours in a ritual that includes washing, beating
oneself with soft birch switches and swimming in a lake.
   In winter, daredevils cool off by rolling naked in the snow or
swimming in a hole in the ice.
   For many Finns, especially in the country, the sauna was until
recently the only source of hot water. Laundry was always washed in
the sauna and no haymaking was complete without a sweat in the hot
room.
   Saunas are ubiquitous in Finnish life _ they are regular
fixtures at large corporate headquarters and lake-shore summer
homes. On the weekend, Finns spend hours warming their saunas and
wisps of smoke above the horizon are a common sight on a Saturday
evening.
   Most apartment blocks have saunas and families take turns going
to the communal bathing rooms. Scrubbing one another's backs is a
major part of the ritual.
   Babies only a few weeks old are taken into saunas and they seem
to thrive in the heat. Physicians say it resembles being in the
womb.
   Finns get angry when the sauna they so treasure is linked abroad
with sleazy ``sauna parlors'' and ``steam baths'' that have more to
do with sex than washing.
   ``The sauna is a piece of summer in the middle of winter, a
place for getting clean, but above all, it is cult place,'' opera
singer Martti Talvela said in an interview shortly before he died
last year.
   Talvela, who regularly entertained foreign guests in one of his
five saunas, felt the ritual was an integral part of being a Finn.
   ``It is the cleanest, purest place.'' he said. ``For Finns it is
the holy origin.''

   A National Guardsman was critically
injured and another was missing after something went wrong when
they jumped from a helicopter into a lake during routine training,
authorities said.
   Four other guardsmen were slightly injured in Sunday's accident,
Lt. Col. Bob Harper, a National Guard spokesman, said today.
Military and law enforcement teams resumed their search of Grenada
Lake this morning for the missing man, authorities said.
   ``This is a fairly routine operation and the men were wearing
swim trunks and inflatable life preservers,'' Harper said. ``We're
not sure what went wrong and an accident investigation team is on
the scene.'' He added that the men had checked the depth of the
water before making the jump.
   The training exercise had nothing to do with the Persian Gulf
crisis, Harper said. The team was participating in an exercise
called ``helicasting,'' where a helicopter comes in very low over
the lake and the people jump into the water.
   The missing guardsman is Sgt. Chet May of Fulton, assigned to a
Columbus-based second battalion, 20th special forces group, Harper
said.
   He identified the critically injured man as Cpl. Ronald S. Kelly
of Jackson. Kelly was taken to a hospital in Memphis, Tenn.,
following the accident, while the four other guardsmen were treated
at a Grenada hospital and released.

<HEAD>Former S.C. State Senator Pleads Guilty In Bribery Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former state senator who admits taking
cash for his support of a pari-mutuel betting bill today become the
third South Carolina legislator to plead guilty to bribery charges
stemming from a federal probe.
   Rick Lee entered his guilty plea before a federal judge this
morning, as he had said he would last month.
   Lee, a Republican from Boiling Springs, resigned his seat two
weeks ago after being indicted on charges he had violated the Hobbs
Act, a federal law banning acceptance of money or gifts in return
for votes or favors.
   The 37-year-old Lee is one of five legislators accused of
trading their votes for cash. Two of them, former Reps. Robert
Brown, D-Marion, and Daniel Winstead, R-Charleston, pleaded guilty
last week. They are awaiting sentencing.
   Reps. Robert Kohn, R-Charleston, and Rep. Luther Taylor,
D-Columbia, have pleaded innocent and are suspended from the House
pending the resolution of the charges. Kohn has withdrawn from his
re-election bid.
   Lee's indictment accused him of agreeing to support, for $2,000,
a bill that would have allowed citizens to vote on whether to
permit betting on horses and greyhounds in South Carolina. The bill
was eventually approved in the Senate Judiciary Committee this
spring but was never acted upon by the full Senate.
   Lee faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   When Lee resigned Aug. 27, he admitted taking money but called
his role in the scandal ``minor.'' Lee's seat will be filled by a
special election in early January.
   The indictments stemmed from a 16-month investigation of
corruption at the Statehouse and more indictments may follow,
federal authorities have said.
   The FBI sting, code-named ``Operation Lost Trust,'' employed a
former House member-turned-lobbyist, Ron Cobb, and an undercover
FBI agent who went by the name Joe Williams.

<HEAD>Delegate Candidate Says Her Integrity `Intact' Despite Tax Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, running for the
District of Columbia's non-voting delegate seat in Congress, says
her ``integrity is intact'' although she filed no D.C. income tax
returns for eight years.
   The former Carter administration official said about $49,000 was
withheld from her salary and paid to the city government between
1982 and 1989, which should cover her city income tax obligations.
   She admitted over the weekend that she and her husband failed to
file D.C. income tax returns for 1982-1989 and also had an
outstanding bill of about $25,000 for a tax dispute stemming from
1982. Norton said a check was mailed to the city over the weekend
to cover that amount.
   Norton, a Georgetown University law professor, has been the
front-runner in the campaign for the Democratic nomination to
succeed Walter E. Fauntroy, who is seeking the party's nomination
for mayor in Tuesday's primary.
   Norton said her husband, Edward, always handled the family's
finances and repeatedly assured her that the tax returns had been
filed. ``I always asked whether the taxes had been filed,'' Norton
said. ``He always said yes.''
   Norton said Sunday she still has a good chance of winning the
party's nomination in Tuesday's primary.
   ``My credibility and integrity is intact because I had no idea
of any personal tax liability,'' said Norton.
   The Washington Post today endorsed D.C. Council member Betty Ann
Kane for the post. The newspaper said Norton's failure to file
income tax returns is ``not just disabling, it is disqualifying.''
   Norton said Sunday she had considered withdrawing from the race,
but decided that she owed it to her followers to remain a candidate.

<TEXT>
   The executive committee of the
Olympic Council of Asia has unanimously recommended that Iraq be
banned from this month's Asian Games and expelled from the council
over its invasion of Kuwait.
   Several Arab nations have threatened to boycott the games, to be
held in Beijing, if Iraq is allowed to take part, officials said.
   The council's Secretary-General C.L. Mehta said the
recommendation was based on a ballot of the 11 nations on the Asian
executive committee and would be voted on by all 38 council members.
   The vote will be held in Beijing Sept. 20, two days before the
games begin. A majority would be needed to bar Iraq from the games.
   However, the International Olympic Council will decide whether
to bar Iraq from all International sporting events during its
congress in Tokyo Sept. 16 to 19, said Hamzah Abu Samah, president
of the Olympic Council Of Malaysia.
   The International Council's resolution would pre-empt the Asian
group's decision in Beijing, said Samah, who is also vice-president
of the international council.
   He said the Arab Olympic Committee has pressed the international
group to suspend Iraq.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and subsequently annexed its
oil-rich neighbor, declaring it part of Iraq territory. The moves
have been condemned by the United Nations Security Council, which
imposed an economic embargo on Baghdad.

<HEAD>Officials Predict Adequate Gasoline and Fuel Oil Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Department officials cautiously
predicted adequate gasoline and fuel oil supplies for the rest of
the year, but said today that could change if there is an unusually
cold winter or war erupts in the Mideast.
   Calvin A. Kent, head of the Energy Information Administration,
told a congressional hearing that the supply of refined petroleum
products from gasoline and heating oil to jet fuel is tight and
refineries are producing at near-maximum capacity.
   But he said U.S. petroleum stocks ``appear adequate'' and that
while the supply of crude oil is expected to be cut by 1 million
barrels a day during the last three months of the year, ``this
shortage can be handled.''
   But Kent preceded his optimistic assessment by listing in
testimony before the House energy and power subcommittee a string
of conditions that he said could cause the situation to change for
the worse.
   Serious supply problems could develop, he said, if there is a
further cut in foreign oil supplies, if fighting erupts in the
Middle East, if the country is hit by a colder-than-normal winter,
if major refinery problems develop or if there is widespread
hoarding of heating oil.
   Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., the subcommittee chairman, said he
was not reassured by the testimony.
   ``With over 90 percent of U.S. refining capacity in constant
use, there is now a very small `margin of safety','' he said,
noting that any unforeseen problem could cause energy shortages.
   Rep. Terry Bruce, D-Ill., said he was ``nervous'' about the slim
margin in refining capacity. ``I fear we will run out of heating
oil, gasoline and jet fuel,'' said Bruce.
   Kent said that current supplies of heating oil on the East
Coast, which heavily depends on oil for heating, are 16 percent
above last year and that ``fuel stocks appear to be adequate
barring any unusually cold weather or refinery breakdowns.''
   As for gasoline, inventories were described as being at their
lowest level since July 1988 _ 5.9 million barrels above the
minimum operating inventory required to prevent a scattering of
shortages.
   ``Gasoline stocks, while tight, should be adequate to see us
through the fourth quarter,'' Kent told the subcommittee. But he
said he would not rule out ``the possibility of some localized
shortages.''
   U.S. refineries were described as operating at better than 96
percent capacity in both July and August, well above the operating
levels of previous summers. But Kent said U.S. refineries should be
able to make up for losses in refined products from Kuwait and Iraq.
   Dewey Mark, speaking for the National Petroleum Refiners Assn.,
said he wasn't as certain that lost imports of refined products
could be made up by increased U.S. production.
   ``As a refinery, when you're operating at 90 percent you're
effectively running wide open,'' he told the subcommittee.
   ``If there is no major disruptive event in the market, the
refining industry will be capable of meeting near-term demands,''
said Mark. ``But the supply balance is tight.''

   A 30-year-old woman was stabbed to death,
becoming the ninth woman linked to one neighborhood to be murdered
in five years and renewing fears that a serial killer may be on the
loose.
   A man has been jailed without bond since May in one of the
previous deaths.
   All the victims were women who had been repeatedly stabbed or
bludgeoned. Several had been sexually assaulted.
   The partially clad body of the latest victim, identified as
Michelle Martin, was found about 1 p.m. Saturday in her apartment
in the city's Frankford section, police said.
   She had been stabbed numerous times. No weapon was found and
there was no sign of forced entry.
   Detective Warren Rosen declined to comment Sunday on whether the
woman's death was believed to be related to the others or whether
she had been sexually assaulted. The investigation continued, he
said.
   Five of the previous victims were killed in Frankford and the
others were killed nearby or frequented bars in Frankford, a
working-class neighborhood on the city's east side.
   Leonard Christopher, 38, of the Frankford section, has been
ordered to stand trial on charges of murder, robbery, possession of
an instrument of crime and abuse of corpse.
   He is charged in the death of Carol Dowd, 46, whose body was
found April 28 behind a fish market three blocks from the scene of
the latest killing. She had been stabbed 36 times and mutilated.
Christopher has been accused only in that case, police stressed.
   The victims ranged in age from 28 to 68.

<TEXT>
   Yasser Arafat's guerrillas controlled the
largest Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon today after crushing
followers of the notorious terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal in three
days of savage combat.
   Police said at least 80 people have been killed and 250 wounded
since Friday, when Arafat's mainstream guerrillas cracked down on
the Fatah-Revolutionary Council in the Ein El-Hilweh shantytown.
   The fighting reached its peak Sunday when the Palestine
Liberation Organization fighters fought hand-to-hand to root out
the last of Abu Nidal's followers hiding in a tunnel network under
the camp.
   The guns fell silent after the 12-hour battle on the
southeastern flank of the port city of Sidon, 25 miles south of
Beirut.
   Arafat's political representative here, Zeid Wehbe, said today
that Abu Nidal followers who sought refugee in Sidon should be
removed because ``their presence in the city is an explosive
destabilization factor.''
   In a press conference at his Ein el-Hilweh residence, Wehbe
accused Abu Nidal's men of triggering Friday's fighting by
kidnapping five Fatah activists.
   Other PLO officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
dozens of Abu Nidal's dissidents were being sheltered by Sunni
Moslem fundamentalist leaders in Sidon.
   The city's 350,000 predominantly Sunni Moslem population was on
strike for a second day today to protest the violence. Mortar and
artillery rounds crashed into residential districts in Sidon during
the fighting.
   Angry youths barricaded the highway entrances to Lebanon's third
largest city with burning car tires as schools, shops, banks, cafes
and restaurants remained closed.
   Traffic ebbed to a trickle and hundreds of fishermen called off
their daily excursions in the Mediterranean waters.
   Posters reading ``Hands off Sidon, Palestinian brethren'' and
``Spare us your wrath'' spanned the empty streets.
   Reporters and photographers touring the battle-scarred camp
found Fatah-Revolutionary Council bases sealed off and guarded by
fighters from the mainstream PLO Fatah faction.
   Unlike Sidon, all shops and businesses were open in the
shantytown that houses nearly 32,000 U.N.-registered refugees. It
is the largest among the 13 refugee camps in Lebanon.
   Police said Fatah has taken prisoner more than 100 of Abu
Nidal's 300 fighters in Ein el-Hilweh, about 40 were killed and the
rest fled to Majdalyoun, five miles east of Sidon.
   Younis Awad, an aide to Arafat, called the outcome of the
fighting a ``final victory'' that brought all refugee camps in
south Lebanon under undisputed PLO control.
   Fatah crushed a 200-man Abu Nidal unit in the Rashidiyeh refugee
camp near the port of Tyre, 25 miles south of Sidon, in June.
   Police officials expressed fears that Arafat's victory will
trigger retaliation by the remnants of Abu Nidal's organization.
   ``We're going to see a wave of assassinations, bombings and
kidnappings against Arafat's men,'' said one official, who declined
to be named.
   Abu Nidal whose real name is Sabri Al-Banna, is now based in
Libya.
   He broke away from Fatah in 1973, and Arafat sentenced him to
death in absentia for killing several PLO officials.
   Abu Nidal tops the most wanted lists in the United States and
Europe. He is suspected of being responsible for scores of
terrorist atrocities, including the December, 1985 bombing attacks
on Rome and Vienna airports in which 20 people were killed.

<HEAD>East Germany Announces Farm Deal With Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's troubled farmers got a break
today when the government announced a $636 million deal to sell
food and coveted cigarettes to the shortage-plagued Soviet Union.
   The deal will allow farmers to get rid of some of the unsold
produce and meat that have been jamming storerooms and
slaughterhouses in the past several months.
   East German stores have been spurning homegrown goods in favor
of Western products.
   About 255,000 tons of meat, 60,000 tons of butter, 5,000 tons of
fish and more than 1 million eggs are included in the contract with
the Soviet Union estimated at $636 million, officials said.
   Also included in the deal is sales of 1 billion cigarettes. The
Soviet Union has been plagued by unrest over mass shortages of
tobacco.
   The contract was announced by government officials and West
German Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle, who will be in charge of
East Germany's crubmling farm economy after the two nations unify
on Oct. 3.
   Officials said deliveries will begin in the next few days and
continue through June.
   Guenther Krause, East Germany's state secretary and top
unification negotiator, called the deal a ``spectacular contract.''
   East German farms, Soviet-style collectives that are typically
overstaffed, have been unable to sell enough goods to cover their
payrolls and operating costs since the nation switched to a free
market on July 1.
   West German food chains made deals with East German stores in
March requiring them to stock many Western products, nudging East
German goods off the shelves.
   Farmers have been slaughtering cows and pigs prematurely because
they could not find places to sell them or afford to feed them, and
some economists say perhaps half of a record grain harvest has been
unsold.

   Illinois prison officials today denied
parole for the seventh time to mass murderer Richard Speck, who has
spent half his life in prison for killing eight student nurses in
1966.
   The Illinois Prisoner Review Board said Speck would continue
serving his sentence of up to 1,200 years, according to board
spokesman Joel Volpe.
   The board denied parole without comment and set Speck's next
hearing for September 1993, Volpe said.
   Speck, 48, didn't attend his seventh parole hearing Thursday at
Stateville Correctional Center near Joliet, where he is serving his
term. But about two dozen friends and relatives of the victims went
to the emotional hearing and asked that Speck not be set free.
   He stabbed and strangled the young women in their townhouse
dormitory near the South Chicago Community Hospital nursing school
in what newspapers later dubbed ``the crime of the century.'' A
ninth woman survived by hiding under a bed.
   Speck originally was sentenced to death. But the U.S. Supreme
Court overturned the sentence and he was resentenced to eight
consecutive prison terms of 50 to 150 years.

   A 77-year-old grandmother was imprisoned
indefinitely today for contempt of court because she has not told a
judge where her daughter has taken her two young granddaughters.
   Mary Pigeon said nothing as she stood before Superior Court
Judge Mark A. Pfieffer during the five-minute hearing.
   The girls were taken from their Warwick home five years ago by
their mother, Elaine Yates, who is Mrs. Pigeon's daughter. Ms.
Yates' estranged husband, Russel M. Yates Jr., has custody and has
been trying to find them.
   Mrs. Pigeon contends she doesn't know where her daughter and
granddaughters are. Outside the courtroom, she exclaimed, ``Elaine,
please come home,'' as she and her attorney, Daniel Schrock, pushed
their way through reporters. They said little else.
   Last month, Pfeiffer gave Mrs. Pigeon until today to talk or
face prison, indicating he was skeptical about her claim not to
know where her daughter is.
   He already ruled that Mrs. Pigeon participated in the abduction
of her granddaughters and conspired with her daughter to keep them
from their father.
   Pfeiffer said he did not like sentencing her to prison until she
talked, ``But we want compliance with the court's order.''
   The girls, Kimberly Ann and Kelly Ann, were respectively 3 years
and 10 months old when they disappeared.
   Mrs. Yates fled within weeks of finding her husband with another
woman on the family boat. Yates since has said that during an
argument over the incident, he hit his wife and cut her forehead
with a diamond ring.
   The Yateses have not yet divorced, but Yates has legal custody
of the children. He has said he doesn't want to divorce her in
absentia because ``I won't let it be easy for her to change her
name or the children's.''
   At this morning's hearing, the judge said he would allow Schrock
to drive Mrs. Pigeon to the Adult Correctional Institutions in
Cranston instead of having her taken there by state marshals. She
arrived there at late morning, prison spokesman Joseph DiNitto said.
   Neil Philbin, Yates' attorney, accused the vanished Ms. Yates of
being ``so ruthless that she would allow her mother to stay in
prison rather than return the children.''
   Yates said he remained optimistic Mrs. Pigeon would reveal the
location of his daughters.

<TEXT>
   Storm Isidore regained enough strength in the
mid-Atlantic today to regain the hurricane status it once had, but
remained a threat only to shipping in the area, forecasters said.
   Isidore, the ninth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season,
posed no threat to land as it continued on a its northwesterly
course at near 8 mph, forecasters said. The system's top sustained
winds, clocked at 60 mph late Sunday, were up to 75 mph, just
barely enough to qualify for hurrican status, at midday today.
   The storm was expected to maintain its course for the next 24
hours with little change in strength likely, according to an
advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral
Gables.
   At noon EDT, Isidore was centered about 1,070 miles southwest of
the Azores, near 30.2 degrees north latitude and 46.7 degrees west
longitude.
   Isidore reached hurricane strength late Thursday and dropped
back to tropical storm strength on Saturday.
   The threshold for tropical storms is 39 mph, while a hurricane
has sustained winds of at least 74 mph. The hurricane season ends
in November.

<TEXT>
   The Constitution Court ruled Monday
that the country's prohibition of adultery is constitutional,
putting an end to heated debate on the legality of extramarital
affairs.
   Six justices of the court, which rules on the constitutionality
of laws, supported the ruling. Three others dissented.
   The court was acting on a complaint by a man in the southern
city of Pusan, who was convicted of adultery and sentenced to two
years in prison. The court said the law banning adultery does not
violate the constitutional clauses governing the right to seek
human dignity, value and happiness and guaranteeing equality.
   The law prohibiting adultery restricts the right to determine
one's own sexual affairs, but such rights can be limited in
accordance with social ethics and public morality, welfare and
interest, the court said.
   ``It is imperative that adultery remain outlawed to protect the
existing marital system and harmonious family life and prevent
social harms that might be caused by it,'' the ruling said.

   Dutch soccer fans hurled a small

   The 55-year-old victim was being treated in a hospital for

   The man was waiting on the platform of this city's railway

the bomb out of a train window for no apparent reason.
   A group of 48 Feyenoord fans was taken off the train, but Van
Haaften said police were unable to determine who threw the bomb.
The fans, who were on their way to a match, were released later
Sunday, he said.
   Feyenoord fans are considered especially violence-prone by
police. The match in the Honor Division, the nation's most senior
soccer league, ended in a scoreless draw.

   Precha said Somsak asked her parents to allow him to marry the
girl, but they replied that she was too young.
   On Sunday, while the parents were collecting rubber sap behind
their house, Somsak shot the girl and then shot himself. Police
said Somsak left behind a diary expressing his love for Laddawan.

<TEXT>
   For the past year, a young thief struck
only on Wednesdays, convinced that no one could catch him on his
``lucky day.''
   Then he tried his hand on Thursday and promptly got caught.
   The Indian Express newspaper said Monday the man identified as
Bhim Singh was caught last week in New Delhi when he tried one of
his favorite scams.
   According to the newspaper, the man often waited outside a bank
until he saw a customer emerge carrying a bag. He would then
approach the victim, tell him he had a big mud spot on the back of
his shirt and offer to help him wash it at a nearby water tap.
   When the intended victim set down the bag to remove his shirt,
the thief would grab the bag full of money and run, the Indian
Express said.
   The newspaper said police had logged a series of such thefts _
always on Wednesdays and always by a perpetrator dressed
immaculately in white.
   When the white-clad thief was caught in the act Thursday, he
told police his mistake was not operating on his lucky day _
Wednesday, the newspaper said.

   The Lithuanian soccer team Zalgiris has been
ordered not to tour South Africa in accordance with an
international ban on sports ties with the racially segregated
nation.
   Vytautas Dirmeikis, secretary of the Lithuanian soccer union,
announced the decision Monday.
   ``The Zalgiris team will not go to the South African tour,'' he
said. ``The final decision to ban its trip was made by the
Lithuanian Soccer Union, the Lithuanian National Olympic Committee
and the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry on Monday.''
   He said the Lithuanian officials' decision was in accordance
with the rules of the international soccer federation, FIFA, and
the Soviet Soccer Federation, which forbid sports ties with South
Africa until apartheid ends.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 30 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the government
and economy. President F.W. de Klerk has said he wants to negotiate
a new constitution to end apartheid.

<HEAD>Candidates Wrap Up Primary Campaigns Amid Predictions of Low Voter
Turnout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Candidates across the nation closed their campaigns with a
blizzard of last-minute television ads in an effort to grab voters'
attention before Tuesday primaries often overshadowed by events in
the Persian Gulf.
   Ten states and the District of Columbia will nominate candidates
for hundreds of offices, but only a handful of contests have
attracted much attention.
   Election officials generally were predicting a low voter
turnout. The predictions ranged from under 40 percent in Arizona to
not much more than 15 percent in Wisconsin, where there were no
tight statewide races.
   ``The Mideast conflict is overshadowing everything,'' said
Robert Frankel, the Democratic leader of the Connecticut House.
``The feeling I get from knocking on doors and talking to people is
that there is a very low perception that there even is a primary.''
   In Connecticut, the major statewide contest is for the
Democratic nomination for governor. Rep. Bruce Morrison campaigned
as ``the guy who doesn't want to raise taxes.'' His opponent, state
legislator William J. Cibes Jr., has called for a tax increase and
an overhaul of the state tax system.
   ``People who don't like tax reform nevertheless like the fact
that I don't shrink from the issue,'' said Cibes.
   Rep. John Rowland already has the Republican nomination for
governor. The front-runner in the race is former Sen. Lowell
Weicker, who is running as an independent.
   A different sort of tax controversy grabbed attention in the
contest for non-voting congressional delegate from the District of
Columbia. Former Carter administration official Eleanor Holmes
Norton was favored to win the Democratic nomination until it was
disclosed that she and her husband failed to file city tax returns
over an eight-year period.
   Norton said her husband, Edward, always handled the family's
finances and repeatedly assured her that the taxes had been paid.
``I always asked whether the taxes had been filed,'' Norton said.
``He always said yes.''
   The Washington Post on Monday endorsed D.C. Council member Betty
Ann Kane for the post and said Norton's failure to file income tax
returns is ``not just disabling, it is disqualifying.''
   In Minnesota, where Gov. Rudy Perpich faces a strong primary
challenge from Mike Hatch, his former commerce commissioner, the
secretary of state's office forecast a Democratic turnout of less
than 25 percent.
   Another endangered officeholder is Rep. Roy Dyson of Maryland,
who is being challenged in the Democratic primary by state
legislator Barbara Kreamer. Dyson has been under investigation for
his relations with defense contractors and was hurt recently by the
disclosure that despite his hawkish record in Congress, he was a
conscientious objector during the Vietnam War.
   In Arizona, where former Gov. Evan Mecham is bidding for the GOP
nomination to regain the office he lost through impeachment,
election officials predicted fewer than 40 percent of Republicans
would turn out for the primary.
   Other states holding primaries are New Hampshire, New York,
Rhode Island, Utah, and Vermont.
   In New Hampshire, where there are primary contests for governor,
Senate and an open congressional seat, candidates scrambled over
the weekend to buy up the remaining available time on WMUR, the
state's only television station.
   Former Sen. John Durkin and Nashua Mayor James Donchess agreed
to allow their competing ads to run during the same commercial
break Sunday evening because that was the only prime time
available. Durkin, Donchess, and businessman John Rauh are
competing for the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat being
vacated by Republican Gordon Humphrey.
   Rep. Bob Smith and lawyer Tom Christo are vying for the GOP
nomination for Humphrey's seat. Eight Republicans and two Democrats
are seeking to replace Smith in the House.
   Bill Zeliff, one of the GOP contenders for the House seat, got a
boost over the weekend when he was endorsed by John Sununu, the
former governor who now is White House chief of staff. The
candidate was airing radio commercials in which Sununu says, ``I've
known Bill Zeliff for a long time. Nobody will work harder to get
the job done.''
   Republican Gov. Judd Gregg had only token opposition for
renomination. The front-runner for the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination is former state party chairman Joseph Grandmaison.
   Hatch was running ads in Minnesota that accused Perpich of
abandoning state development projects that didn't offer ``glitz.''
   ``When the glitz is gone, so is Rudy Perpich,'' a narrator says.
``Can we afford four more years? We need guts, not glitz.''
   Hatch said he decided to run the ad after Perpich began airing
commercials in which he takes credit for creating 350,000 jobs in
Minnesota since 1983.
   ``As long as he's personally claiming that, then it's my
obligation to say, `Look, that's baloney,''' Hatch said.
   On the GOP side, state Auditor Arne Carlson was the subject of
attacks from both his major opponents.
   With a poll showing Carlson 18 points ahead of his closest
opponent, both businessman Jon Grunseth and former federal
prosecutor Doug Kelley turned their sights on the leader.
   ``The choice: liberal Arne Carlson or Jon Grunseth, the
officially endorsed Republican candidate for governor,'' says a
Grunseth ad that tries to paint Carlson as too liberal for GOP
voters on the issues of crime, taxes and abortion.
   The prospect of a low turnout in Arizona was regarded as a
factor that could help Mecham in the GOP primary against
front-runner Fife Symington, a Phoenix developer, and three other
candidates.
   ``If the turnout is under 35 percent, Mecham could win it,''
said Bruce Merrill, director of the Media Research Center at
Arizona State University.

   A lawyer for a disturbed young man
under suspicion in the stabbing deaths of five college students
disputed the importance of a knife reportedly found in a milk
carton at the suspect's grandmother's home.
   J.R. Russo, Edward Lewis Humphrey's lawyer, said Sunday he could
not confirm reports of the knife. But he said, ``An emotionally
disturbed individual might keep his toothbrush under the pillow and
his shoes in the oven.''
   The Gainesville Sun reported Sunday that police found the knife
in a carton during a search of the home in Indialantic, about 180
miles southeast of Gainesville, exactly where Humphrey told
investigators it would be.
   Lab tests will be performed to determine if the knife is linked
to the slayings, the newspaper said.
   Police in Gainesville have said only that ``promising evidence''
has been found in searches.
   Steve Platt of the state department of law enforcement crime lab
in Jacksonville said today that 17 to 20 people are working around
the clock to analyze evidence taken from the three crime scenes and
from Humphrey's Gainesville apartment, his grandmother's
Indiatlantic home, and his car.
   ``We are faced with what can be likened to three very complex
puzzles that we are trying to put together one piece at a time,''
he said. ``It's a slow, painstaking effort.''
   Neither police spokesmen or Platt would confirm news reports
about the knife found at the Indialantic home.
   Humphrey has been identified as one of eight suspects but has
not been charged in the slayings last month. He is being held on $1
million bail on charges of beating up his grandmother.
   Published reports have said that Humphrey may have a multiple
personality and has referred to himself as ``John'' and by other
names, including `Henry.'' The Sun also reported he sometimes makes
references to a female personality.
   The Florida Times-Union reported Saturday that Humphrey had told
investigators he knew who killed the first two victims. They
believe that he was talking about one of his other personalities,
the newspaper said.
   Police have refused to comment on the report.
   Experts said the slayings were committed by a meticulous killer
who may also be a sexual sadist because of the way three bodies
were mutilated.
   Humphrey's grandmother, Elna Hlavaty, 79, has said she wants to
drop the charges and defended her grandson, who suffers from
psychiatric problems and takes Lithium to control mood swings.
   ``They want to crucify my grandson,'' she said Sunday. ``They
are drumming up a case. He will do anything to sleep when he needs
his medication. He will say anything.''
   Officials say the cost of hunting for the killer has been almost
$750,000 so far, or about $50,000 a day, for the Alachua County
Sheriff's Office, the Gainesville Police Department and the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement. Other agencies have not yet added up
their costs.
   The only other suspect publicly identified is Stephen Michael
Bates, 30, a Lakeland short-order cook jailed on an unrelated
assault charge.

<BYLINE>Kremlin Advisers Struggle to Win Gorbachev's OK on New Soviet
Structure
^By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kremlin advisers struggled today to persuade
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to endorse a sweeping
economic reform plan backed by rival Boris Yeltsin and a high-level
task force.
   The plan would transfer enormous authority from the national
parliament to the legislatures of the 15 Soviet republics,
according to a draft obtained by The Associated Press.
   Gorbachev's economic adviser Stanislav Shatalin, author of the
proposal, said the draft was an early version but included the
basics of his plan for an economic union.
   It calls for Gorbachev's central government to accept two
controversial claims by the republics: control of their own natural
resources, and the superiority of their laws over national ones.
However, it is not clear whether the veto power extends to all
issues or only economic ones.
   Although billed as an economic reform plan, it amounts to a new
political blueprint for the country. If signed by Gorbachev and
representatives of the 15 republics, it would amount to an
agreement on the principles of a new union treaty _ the basic
unifying document of the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev's advisers were racing against a Tuesday deadline,
when the Soviet government is scheduled to present parliament with
some plan for economic reform.
   Shatalin told reporters at the Soviet parliament today that he
believed Gorbachev generally supported his radical proposal. But he
said he still did not know whether his plan would be the one
presented to parliament on Tuesday.
   Many legislators said they feared they would be offered only the
much more conservative proposal of Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov.
It calls for continued central planning and strong central
government, with a slow transition to a partial market economy.
   Ryzhkov and his staff believe that swift transition to a market
would be ``like an overdose for an exhausted patient,'' the
official Soviet news agency Tass said in its report on the session.
   The Shatalin plan calls for creation of a voluntary economic
union of the 15 republics of the Soviet Union. Each republic would
control its own finances and natural resources, and each would be
entitled to a share of the national gold and hard currency
reserves, according to the early draft.
   ``The implementation of all functions and authority of the
members of the union is based on the principle of superiority of
the legislation of the sovereign republics, and effective
distribution of functions between the republic and national
governments,'' the draft said. However, it did not say if this
referred to all issues or only economic ones.
   The national government would retain control of defense,
economic forecasting, money supply, customs, and restoration of the
environment. It would run national scientific research and space
programs, atomic energy, railroads and communications. It would be
allowed to control only those prices the republics allowed it to
regulate.
   The national government would have no power to tax citizens and
companies. Instead, the republics would pay dues based on their
share of national income, the draft says.
   Currently, bureaucrats in Moscow set prices and divvy up factory
production among many customers. As a result, the market is in
permanent disarray, with every factory short of critical supplies.
   The Shatalin plan allows republic governments to make their own
decisions on trade with other republics, with prices and volume of
trade set in contracts.

<HEAD>Illinois Governor Refuses to Commute Death Penalty For Charles
Walker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. James R. Thompson refused today to commute
the death sentence of convicted murderer Charles Walker, removing
one of the last possible barriers to Walker's scheduled execution
this week.
   ``The imposition of the death penalty in this case is
appropriate,'' Thompson said in a news conference at the State of
Illinois Center.
   ``I made the decision myself in my office this morning,'' the
governor said. ``In the end it was not a difficult decision, except
for knowing that there's nothing that stands between him and the
sentence, except me.''
   Walker, 50, has repeatedly requested that no further steps be
taken to prevent or delay his execution by injection early
Wednesday. He was sentenced for the 1983 murder of a young
Mascoutah couple in a $40 robbery.
   If the sentence is carried out this week, Illinois would become
the 16th state to execute someone since the U.S. Supreme Court in
1976 allowed use of the death penalty to resume. No one has been
executed in Illinois since 1962.
   ``I think Mr. Walker has put himself to death; I'm simply not
standing in the way,'' Thompson said.
   The governor added that Walker might still have a chance to save
himself, if he changes his mind about not appealing the sentence.
   Several groups had asked Thompson to commute Walker's sentence,
including the state's Roman Catholic bishops. They wrote to
Thompson saying the death penalty undermines the sacredness of
human life.
   Some lawyers believe that if Walker were to pursue his appeals,
he could probably could get his death sentence reversed.
   At Walker's 1983 death-sentence hearing, prosecutors offered
testimony about the victims' lives from the grandfather of the
slain youth and the sister of his girlfriend. Walker's lawyer
didn't object, but four years later the U.S. Supreme Court barred
the use of such testimony in capital cases.
   A prosecutor told jurors that if they didn't sentence Walker to
death, he could receive as little as 20 years in prison and might
eventually be paroled.
   In fact, state law then provided a minimum sentence of life in
prison without parole. But again no objections were raised, and a
juror later gave a sworn statement saying the prosecutor's
misstatement figured in the jury's decision to sentence Walker to
death.

<HEAD>Trend to Private Ownership is Worldwide, but Changes Come Slowly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trend to private enterprise is worldwide,
but significant changes will take time, especially in Eastern
Europe, says an international finance official in the forefront of
the transition.
   ``The process of privatization in Eastern Europe is going to be
slow, and one should not expect results too quickly,'' said Sir
William Ryrie, executive vice president of the International
Finance Corporation.
   After the dramatic collapse of communist governments last year,
the countries of Central and Eastern Europe that decided to shift
from state to private enterprise are finding it a complex process,
involving the selection of capital sources and the introduction of
modern management, Ryrie said.
   He appeared at a news conference marking Monday's release of the
annual report of the 135-nation IFC, the World Bank affiliate that
is the leading source of investment for private companies in the
developing world.
   The corporation approved the investment of $2.2 billion in
fiscal 1990 for 122 projects in 38 countries, demonstrating, Ryrie
said, ``the growing opportunities for profitable private investment
in developing countries.'' Overall costs of IFC-financed projects
totaled nearly $9.4 billion, reflecting the attraction to other
investors of IFC participation.
   Eastern Europe, along with Africa, represents special challenges
for IFC, he said. ``These countries are trying to make a very rapid
move from socialist to market economy and need assistance of an
organization like ours.''
   The IFC is very actively providing both investment and technical
services to Poland and Hungary, Ryrie said. Soon after
Czechoslovakia's forthcoming admission to membership, the IFC will
hold talks in Prague on possible joint ventures with
Czechoslovakia. Bulgaria and Romania are expected to join IFC later.

   The birthday of Ferdinand Marcos, the ousted

two days early with songs, a Mass and a potluck luncheon at the
cemetery where he is entombed.
   Marcos' widow, Imelda, told reporters after Sunday's three-hour
celebration that she still hopes President Corazon Aquino will
permit Marcos to be buried in his homeland.
   The Marcoses fled to Hawaii in February 1986 when a revolt
propelled Mrs. Aquino to power. She has cited national security in
consistently refusing to let Mrs. Marcos return to the Philippines.
She also has refused to let Marcos be buried in the Philippines.
   About 700 people attended the memorial. Marcos died Sept. 28,
1989, at age 72.
   Mrs. Marcos was acquitted in June of federal racketeering and
fraud charges in New York. On Sept. 25, she is to appear before a
grand jury in Pittsburgh investigating the construction of a
nuclear power plant in the Philippines.

<TEXT>
   After she ignited a firestorm by staging a
Statehouse coup against Gov. Michael S. Dukakis last week, Lt. Gov.
Evelyn Murphy reportedly has decided to drop out of the race for
governor.
   Murphy scheduled a news conference this afternoon to make a
``major statement,'' her campaign said.
   WCVB-TV, WHDH-TV and WBZ-TV in Boston as well as The Patriot
Ledger of Quincy, citing unnamed sources, were reporting that
Murphy had decided to withdraw.
   After Dukakis left last week on a trade mission in West Germany,
Murphy seized the crown of acting governor, unveiling proposals to
slash state spending to help overcome the state budget crunch.
   The plans, which Murphy predicted would save the state up to
$150 million, included executive orders to fire an estimated 1,000
workers and cut salaries for some others. Murphy also asked
agencies to cut their 1992 budgets 10 percent below spending levels
for the current fiscal year.
   She was running behind two other candidates in the polls for the
race for the Democratic nomination to succeed Dukakis, who is not
running for another term. The primary is next week.

<HEAD>Panel Considers Trial Run at Cameras in Federal Courtrooms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans soon could be getting their first
televised glimpse of federal court proceedings.
   A five-judge study committee is recommending a three-year,
carefully controlled experiment that would allow cameras and radio
equipment to record civil trials in federal courtrooms.
   The U.S. Judicial Conference, the policy-making arm of the
federal courts, will meet Wednesday to consider the proposal. If
the conference agrees, a handful of courtrooms could be open to
cameras by July.
   The plan envisions a variety of uses for the cameras, including
airing the highlights of testimony on the evening news or the full
trial on cable TV.
   The cameras also could tape the day's proceedings for a federal
court juror who is sick and unable to attend the trial.
   And closed circuit video systems would allow officials to
maintain security surveillance of the courtroom.
   Until last month, the opposition to cameras in court by federal
judges appeared unwavering.
   But on the eve of the Judicial Conference's semiannual meeting,
that appears to be changing.
   The conference is composed of 27 federal judges and is headed by
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
   Rehnquist said last May that he was ``by no means averse to the
idea'' of an experimental program permitting cameras in court.
Rehnquist's predecessor, Warren E. Burger, was dead set against the
idea. ``Over my dead body,'' Burger reportedly said of a proposal
to televise Supreme Court proceedings.
   And while the study committee said most federal judges oppose
lifting all restrictions on cameras in the courtroom, it said most
support the proposed experiment.
   The panel, headed by U.S. District Judge Robert F. Peckham of
San Francisco, voted 4-1 to open civil _ but not criminal _
proceedings to photographic and broadcast coverage.
   ``Like the chief justice, a majority of your committee is not
averse to controlled experimentation on a voluntary basis and would
like to offer federal judges the opportunity to observe the effect
of camera coverage and broadcasting of proceedings in federal
court,'' the panel wrote.
   The experiment would be limited to two federal appeals courts
and six trial courts. Judges who volunteer their courtrooms for the
experiment would have broad control over what the public sees.
   Forty-four states have allowed some camera coverage of their
judicial proceedings. But the federal court system, a separate
entity, has been reluctant to go along.
   ``The committee's recommendation is excellent,'' said Timothy
Dyk, a lawyer for news organizations lobbying for cameras in court.
``It really proposes a very significant experiment.''
   No serious problems have been reported in state courts that have
allowed cameras, say Dyk and other advocates.
   Federal judges who have resisted the idea give various reasons.
   Some have said they worry about losing their anonymity, that
lawyers will engage in grandstanding or that television will
provide only snippets that will distort the proceedings.
   Whatever the outcome Wednesday when the Judicial Conference
studies the Peckham committee plan, Supreme Court proceedings are
not likely to be prime-time fare anytime soon.
   The conference has no control over what the high court does, and
the justices generally have been hostile to television cameras in
their courtroom.
   Sources at the high court say the justices were turned off to
the idea after watching Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork get
roughed up verbally at televised confirmation hearings before the
Senate Judiciary Committee in 1987. Bork subsequently was rejected
by the Senate.

   The man, who was not identified, was handcuffed to a chain-link
fence near the main gate at Brainerd International Raceway on
Saturday despite his pleas to be set free or turned over to police,
the Duluth News-Tribune reported.
   The newspaper said dozens of people saw the man chained to the
fence around 2 a.m. by guards after he drove an all-terrain vehicle
recklessly through the track's pit and infield area.
   Other witnesses said the man screamed during the night and was
released to go to the bathroom and to sleep awhile, but then was
chained to the fence again until around 9 a.m.
   Track President David Ames said the man was chained to the fence
for only a short time. He said the man was very drunk and
threatened the safety of several people and vehicles in the area.
   ``He was handcuffed and tied to the fence twice, but it wasn't
for nearly as long as these people are saying,'' Ames said.
   Ames said the guards' decision not to contact the sheriff's
department was a ``judgment call.''
   ``The guy isn't making a big deal out of this. I don't know why
everybody else is,'' Ames said.

   The dough is rising, the tomato sauce is simmering
and deep pans are being oiled at Pizza Hut's first two Soviet
restaurants, which are set to open Tuesday in Moscow.
   After three years of negotiations and seven months of
construction, 300 young workers are ready to serve up
American-style pizza, garlic bread, salad and apple pies for both
dollars and rubles.
   The opening comes one day after Pizza Hut's first restaurant
opened in Beijing. The Beijing restaurant served 200 pizzas to an
invitation-only crowd of Chinese and foreigners before running out
of dough. By mid-afternoon, it was turning away disappointed people.
   Pepsico Inc., which owns Pizza Hut, says the invitation to set
up business in Moscow was initiated by the former Soviet ambassador
to the United States, Anatoly Dobrinyn, who frequently ate with his
family at Pizza Hut in Washington, D.C.
   The restaurants are technically owned by Moscow Pizza, a $10
million joint venture between Moscow's restaurant department and
Pepsico's European branch.
   The Soviet workers were selected from more than 3,000 applicants
and received weeks of training here and in London in more than just
the cooking and serving of pizza. Andy Rafalet, regional operations
director, said they had to learn to smile, not snarl like many
Soviet restaurant workers, and recognize the body language of
hungry or impatient customers.
   Similar training was given when McDonald's introduced fast food
to the Soviet Union eight months ago.
   One of the new pizzerias is on Gorky Street, a main thoroughfare
minutes from the Kremlin. It seats 120 people and features a
take-out window selling slices of pizza for rubles only.
   The bigger of the two restaurants, near a large foreigners'
compound on Kutuzovsky Prospekt, will have a take-out service and
separate dining rooms for ruble- and dollar-paying customers.
   The decor is like any other Pizza Hut, down to the red-and-white
checked tabletops, red chrome chairs, fake tropical plants and red
roof logo. But in a concession to the long Soviet winters, dozens
of brass coatracks have been installed to accommodate bulky coats,
scarves and hats.
   A special Moscow pizza topped with salmon, smoked sardines and
onions has been added to a menu listing only nine combinations. No
substitutions are allowed. Soviets are not accustomed to large
menus because most restaurants here offer limited choices, and many
of those are unavailable on any given day.
   The salad bars in the Moscow Pizza Huts are short on lettuce and
heavy on the coleslaw;, the coffee hasn't arrived yet; and the
Kutuzovsky restaurant ran out of Pepsi one hour into a pre-opening
press bash.
   But Moscow's Communist Party youth newspaper had a sneak preview
and gave it the thumbs up: ``The first thing you are treated to is
a smile. And at once you start feeling easy and at home.''
   ``In less than a minute, a pretty waitress came up to us and
smiled,'' Moskovskaya Komsomolets said. ``(She) asked us what we
would like to order, but we looked blank, salivating and asking her
what each dish she mentioned was.''
   Pizza Hut has imported basic supplies but is relying on local
flour and vegetables. It commissioned its own beer from a local
brewery and is involved in a Soviet joint venture to make
mozzarella cheese.
   Pizza Hut says the four ovens in its bigger restaurant can
produce 5,000 pizzas daily, and it expects to serve 50,000
customers a week, about seven times the turnover of any Pizza Hut
in the United States. McDonald's Moscow outlet still sells 5,000
burgers an hour and the lunchtime lineup is 90 minutes long.
   The restaurants are part of a $3 billion trade pact in which the
Soviet Union will build at least 10 ships, mostly oil tankers, to
be sold or leased by Pepsico in return for foreign credits.
   The two-story, 180-seat Beijing restaurant expects to serve
about 285 pizzas daily, mainly to foreign tourists and foreign
residents of Beijing.
   For some Chinese, the $4.60 price of a pizza was enough to turn
them away from Monday's grand opening. ``That's almost one-sixth of
my salary. I have to save before I can bring my 3-year-old son here
to have a meal,'' said one man outside.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House said today that Iraq is
showing signs of desperation by trying to mend relations with its
former enemy, Iran, and by offering free supplies of oil to Third
World nations.
   ``The desperation attempts, reaching out to Iran and this free
oil for the Third World, indicates that the pressure (from
international sanctions) is pinching them someplace,'' White House
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``Such maneuvers have not worked in the past and will not work
this time,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said Iran had pledged to abide by the global
embargo against Iraq, and would be expected to honor that
commitment.
   ``They've been enemies for so long. It's hard to believe Iran's
going to be too supportive in this effort,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``It shows (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein's reaching to a
country where he murdered millions of their people,'' Fitzwater
added. `So, he's grasping at any straw he can find.''
   Despite the bloody eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, Iran
announced it was establishing diplomatic relations with Iraq.
   The official Iranian news agency said the agreement between Iran
and Iraq was reached in a meeting between Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati and his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz, who ended
a 24-hour visit to Iran today.
   Separately, Saddam offered to supply oil free of charge to Third
World countries in what he said was a gesture of solidarity.
   Fitzwater predicted the offer would be spurned.
   ``It is an affront to all countries for Saddam to think that
they would sacrifice the principles of freedom and non-aggression
for the Iraqi oil or the oil that he has taken through his naked
aggression against Kuwait,'' the press spokesman said.
   Dismissing Saddam's offer, Fitzwater said, ``It means nothing.
The sanctions (approved by the United Nations) clearly cover the
oil, at any cost.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of former governors announced Monday
the foundation of a national research and information center to
help business understand the impact of lawmaking and regulation in
all 50 states.
   The National Resource Center for State Laws and Regulation is
intended to be ``the most complete clearing house available on what
is happening in state capitals,'' said former Minnesota Gov.
Wendell Anderson, one of 17 ex-governors serving as advisers to the
new center.
   Founded with a $150,000 grant from a network of private law
firms operating in state capitals, the center will have a
membership open to corporations, professional groups, trade
associations, public officials and the news media.
   J. Phil Carlton, a former associate justice of the North
Carolina Supreme court, will serve as the chairman of the center,
which has its headquarters in Raleigh, N.C.
   Carlton said the center will become a valuable resource as
states take the lead from the federal government on such issues as
taxes, environmental regulation, health care insurance, antitrust
law, employment law and consumer protection.
   He said the center will offer practical information, including
an assessment of whether bills are likely to pass or whether they
will be vetoed if they do.

<HEAD>Federal Report Probably Means End to Blood-Heating: AIDS
Researcher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One month ago Dr. William Logan told Georgia's
AIDS Task Force that two medical schools wanted to duplicate his
blood-heating approach to fighting the disease and said 50 patients
could be treated by year's end.
   Now, Logan admits bluntly, his research is almost certainly
finished, because of a scathing report by federal investigators.
   ``As far as I can tell, at this point in time, it's dead,''
Logan said.
   Logan and another Atlanta physician, Dr. Kenneth Alonso,
announced earlier this year that they had treated two AIDS patients
with hyperthermia _ heating a patient's blood to raise his body
temperature.
   The first patient, Carl Crawford, 33, disclosed the treatment to
reporters, pointing to visible improvements and pronouncing himself
cured of the deadly and so far incurable disease. A second patient,
who kept his identity confidential, was largely unchanged.
   Skepticism was widespread.
   But Logan, a heart surgeon, felt confident in his research when
he appeared by invitation before the Georgia AIDS Task Force in
August. He and Alonso had dissolved their collaboration _ Alonso
went on to Mexico and treated a third patient, who died _ but Logan
promised to press on with careful work at U.S. research
institutions.
   Critics wanted someone else to duplicate the experiments, and
Logan told the task force that two university medical centers were
in negotiation to do just that. Regulatory problems unrelated to
the hyperthermia treatments had cropped up at Atlanta Hospital, the
small medical center where the experiments were performed, but
Logan said another hospital would soon take on the project.
   Logan was careful not to claim he'd invented a cure for AIDS.
``I feel like we've opened a little crack in the door,'' he said.
   But two weeks earlier, several investigators from the National
Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases _ a leading
government AIDS research agency _ had visited Atlanta at Alonso's
invitation to check out hyperthermia.
   On Aug. 4, the institute's report came out.
   The investigators said hyperthermia ``appears to have offered no
clinical, immunologic or virologic benefits.'' They said Crawford's
skin lesions weren't the rare AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma; they
were cat scratch fever.
   There was no reason ``for further human experimentation in this
area at this time,'' they concluded.
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the institute, accused the
hyperthermia team of having ``led to a lot of confusion,
frustration and false hope on the part of HIV-infected
individuals.''
   ``This is another example of why we've got to be careful before
we jump on claims ... of a new treatment or cure,'' Fauci said.
   In an interview last week, Logan could scarcely hide his anger.
   ``I am totally flabbergasted,'' he said, adding that the report,
carrying the weight of the institute and its parent National
Institutes of Health, would almost certainly scare off any research
institution or hospital from doing hyperthermia tests.
   ``This is why I am so terribly upset. ... I'm going to fight
this every way that I can, but I don't know what we're going to
do,'' he said.
   One medical school mentioned as a site for Logan's hyperthermia
trials was Mercer University in Macon. The plan never got past the
informal talking stage and now it probably never will, said the
medical school's dean, Dr. Douglas Skelton.
   Logan suggested that Fauci should be fired.
   ``He does not have an open mind,'' Logan said. ``He really has
betrayed an awful lot of people. ... You know what they say about
NIH: Nothing Invented Here. I don't think he's doing a damned thing
up there.''
   Press representatives at NIAID did not return calls Monday
seeking comment from Fauci regarding Logan's criticism.
   Logan thinks somebody will carry on his work.
   ``The medical community is not going to buy this,'' he said of
the report.
   That could still be under the auspices of Alonso, who said last
week he ``most likely'' would perform hyperthermia treatments for
AIDS again.
   On Monday, Alonso's wife, Carmen Alonso, who has served as
spokeswoman through the publicity surrounding the procedure, said
he has five new sites, ``major hospitals'' in Miami, Dallas, Los
Angeles, Italy and Costa Rica. She did not further identify the
hospitals.
   The report by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious
Diseases also appears to have dampened the hopes of some AIDS
patients and advocates _ although few AIDS groups had embraced the
hyperthermia theory to start with.
   Dr. Melanie Thompson, president of the Atlanta AIDS Research
Consortium, a physician who treats AIDS patients, told reporters
she was disappointed.
   ``But I am thankful someone has finally reviewed the information
in depth and given us the answers we have been waiting for,'' she
said.

   The mayor of Omaha, accomplished in political
races, gave the dirt-track variety a spin and finished last despite
a promising start.
   Mayor P.J. Morgan drove a 1977 Camaro stock car in an eight-lap
event Sunday before a crowd estimated at 3,000 at Omaha's Sunset
Speedway.
   ``It was really great out there,'' Morgan said after finishing
last in the field of eight.
   He roared to the lead after the first lap and held the top spot
until he was passed by Omahan Rob Walker on the eighth lap.
   Then Morgan spun out about 50 feet from the checkered flag.
   ``I was really trying to catch up to him but I just lost it
coming out of the corner,'' Morgan said later.
   It's not as though Morgan was a complete innocent in the world
of hot cars.
   He owned a Ferrari or two and a few other exotic sports cars
before taking office. And he had aspirations of becoming a race-car
driver when he was younger and attended a racing school at Ontario
(Calif.) Motor Speedway about 20 years ago.

an unusually realistic portrayal of daily life in the mob.
   Italian critics were enthusiastic, and are predicting that the
movie will be in the running for an award when the festival closes

   ``Goodfellas,'' starring Robert De Niro in his sixth Scorsese

biographical account of a New York mobster.
   ``I wanted to reject clearly the stereotypical idea we have of
gangsters,'' Scorsese said. ``I didn't want to make one of the
usual films about `godfathers.'''

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unconfirmed reports said today that
President Samuel Doe has been killed by rebels from a breakaway
faction who captured him in a battle in Monrovia this weekend.
   In Washington, State Department officials said they were aware
of the reports coming from a camp outside Monrovia of rebel leader
Prince Johnson, but could not confirm them.
   The British Broadcasting Corp., quoting witnesses who came to
the Liberian capital from the camp, reported that Doe's mutilated
body is on display there.
   Johnson had telephoned the BBC to say he had captured Doe in a
battle Sunday because Liberia's leader of 10 years was trying to
flee the country, possibly on a ship of a West African task force
sent to end the 8{-month-old war.
   Meanwhile, Liberia's main rebel fighters demanded today that
West African troops withdraw from Monrovia, and said they would
keep fighting despite the capture of Doe by a rival rebel faction.
   Tom Woewiyu, chief spokesman of Charles Taylor's National
Patriotic Front, dashed hopes for an early end to the tribal
conflict in which three warring parties have killed more than 5,000
civilians.
   Woewiyu's announcement that Taylor's rebels would keep fighting
despite the capture of Doe came in a telephone interview from
Burkina Faso, one of eight West African nations he has visited in
an effort to get the West African force to withdraw from Monrovia.
   ``Their mission has failed, and a prime example is thahe capture
of Doe by the Prince Johnson group right in their headquarters,''
Woewiyu said.
   Prince Johnson, whose men captured Doe in a battle at the
headquarters of the West African task force in Monrovia port,
declared he would run Liberia until elections are held. He said he
would court-martial Doe, who was reportedly shot in both legs in
the fighting.
   Johnson controls Monrovia, but Taylor's 10,000-strong army has
overrun much of the rest of Liberia.
   In Harare, Zimbabwe, the chairman of the Economic Community of
West African Nations, which sent a five-nation task force to end
the fighting, said today Doe's overthrow may bring peace to Liberia.
   Taylor began the struggle to topple Doe, accusing him of
corruption and human rights abuses. Doe, a former army sergeant,
seized power in a bloody 1980 coup and claimed to have thwarted
more than 30 attempts to topple him since.
   More than 5,000 people have been killed since Taylor crossed
into Liberia from the Ivory Coast in December, and the 3,000-member
West African task force was dispatched Aug. 24 to end bloodletting
that has followed ethnic lines.
   Sixty-four people, including dozens of Doe's bodyguards, were
killed in Sunday's fighting between Doe loyalists and Johnson's
fighters, witnesses said. Doe had left his fortified seaside
mansion to pay an unscheduled visit to the commander of the task
force, Lt. Gen Arnold Quainoo of Ghana at the headquarters of the
West African task force in Monrovia.
   Johnson and some of his fighters followed Doe and his
bodyguards, and a quarrel erupted outside the headquarters. The two
sides then started battling with rifles, machine guns and grenades.
   The rebels hunted down Doe and his followers from room to room
of the headquarters, slaughtering most of them. Then they seized
Doe, who had been shot in both legs, and carried him off to their
base camp.
   Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara, who leads the West African
group, said today Doe's ouster might help the peace process in
Liberia.
   ``All the factions that were involved in the fighting, including
other interest groups, were insisting that Doe must go,'' Jawara
said.
   He said the West African community would try to consult both
rebel leaders about an interim government. He made no reference to
Johnson's declaring himself president.
   Johnson seized control of most of Monrovia after a split with
Taylor.
   The West African task force said today that Doe's aides were
trying to negotiate the evacuation by ship of the president's
relatives who remain holed up in his mansion.
   Meanwhile, Doe loyalists named Brig. Gen. David Nimley acting
president following Doe's capture.
   Liberia has been without effective government for months and
Monrovia has been besieged by the three armies since mid-July.
   When the West African task force sailed into Monrovia two weeks
ago Doe and Johnson agreed to an informal cease-fire. But Taylor's
forces claimed the West African task force supported Doe, and
continued fighting.
   The war has left Monrovia without running water and telephone
communications and the West African task force had been working to
try to create secure enough conditions to bring in international
relief workers.
   Very little food has made it to the capital, a city of 400,000
people, for about two months.
   About 2,100 U.S. Marines are based on ships off Monrovia and
assigned to guard the U.S. Embassy and residential compound. They
have evacuated hundreds of foreigners from the city but have orders
not to intervene in the war.
   Liberia, a nation of about 2 million people, has strategic
importance for the United States. It is the base for all diplomatic
messages to and from U.S. missions in Africa.
   In addition, there is a huge Voice of America transmission
station a few miles from Monrovia, and the country has a powerful
marine transmitter responsible for guiding all U.S. shipping in the
Atlantic Ocean.
   Liberia was founded by freed American slaves in 1847.

   In three months, 5-year-old Nicolette
Folsom has lost her mother and father because of AIDS, and her
little sister also is battling the disease.
   On Sunday, Nicolette was one of 300 attending a memorial service
for her mother, Jennifer, who died last week of AIDS.
   Her father, Doug, shot himself in June, unable to continue
watching his wife and 3-year-old daughter, Angela, waste away with
the disease. Nicolette was not infected.
   The girls now live with Folsom's parents, Don and June Kenney,
in Fayston.
   The memorial service brought together in the small wooden
Waitsfield Federated Church a community in mourning.
   ``I wish this could be the closing chapter in the story about
AIDS for Don and June and their family,'' said the Rev. Paul Martz.
``But until a medical treatment is found, AIDS will be part of this
community's landscape.''
   Mrs. Folsom believed she contracted the disease through a blood
transfusion during an emergency appendectomy in a Massachusetts
hospital in 1979 _ before blood supplies were tested and purged of
the virus.
   She told her story publicly in July, saying she wanted people to
know that the AIDS epidemic exists in rural areas, and to educate
people about the need to fight its spread.
   She acknowledged at that time that her own death was inevitable.
   ``I think about it more lately, that death is reality, this is
reality. You can't wash it off in the shower. It's here and it's
real and there's no light at the end of that tunnel,'' she said.
``I just wish it would go away and I know it's not going to go
away.''
   Leith said Sunday that Mrs. Folsom's story prompted telephone
calls, letters and donations from around the country. As of last
week, more than $32,000 had been collected for the family _ most to
be used for Jennifer's and Angela's medical bills and a college
trust fund for Nicolette.

   The State Department has received confirmation
that Liberian President Samuel Doe has been killed, sources said
today.
   The department said it had been informed by various sources that
Doe died after a weekend shootout with rebel forces.
   State Department sources, who asked not to be identified, said
U.S. officials regard the reports as reliable and consider them
confirmation of Doe's death.
   Department spokesman Mark Dillen said the department had reports
from several sources, including representatives of rebel forces led
by Prince Johnson that Doe ``died from the gunshot wounds he
suffered in the shootout with Prince Johnson.''

   Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy dropped out of the race for
governor today, days after igniting a firestorm by staging a
Statehouse coup against Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   ``This is no time for business as usual and it is no time for
politics as usual. Therefore today I am withdrawing as a
candidate,'' Murphy told a news conference this afternoon.
   `This is not a political ploy,'' she said. ``It is an honest and
necessary act of leadership.''
   For the Sept. 18 Democratic primary, she threw her support
behind former state Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti, who she
said ``represents the best hope for change in the Statehouse.''
   Last week, after Dukakis left on a trade mission in West
Germany, Murphy seized the crown of acting governor, unveiling
proposals to slash state spending to help overcome the state budget
crunch.
   The plans, which Murphy predicted would save the state up to
$150 million, included executive orders to fire an estimated 1,000
workers and cut salaries for some others.
   Murphy acknowledged Dukakis could simply undo her work once he
returns Friday, but insisted she was trying to save the state from
sinking further in its fiscal mess.
   Critics called her move an act of desperation because of her
standing in the polls that would be rejected by voters.
   She was running behind both Bellotti and Boston University
President John Silber for the Democratic nomination to succeed
Dukakis, who is not running for another term.
   Along with many Democrats, she was an avid Dukakis supporter
during his 1988 presidential bid. But the state's fiscal woes have
made Dukakis the source of public disdain, and Murphy has joined
the politicians treating the governor like a pariah.
   Because of the lateness of her withdrawal, Murphy will remain on
the ballot next week.

<HEAD>German Leaders Announce Deal to Help Farmers, Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   German officials on Monday announced a
``spectacular'' deal to help troubled East German farmers supply
shortage-plagued Soviets with food and precious cigarettes.
   The contract, estimated at $636 million, will allow East Germans
to rid their packed storehouses and processing plants of millions
of tons in unsold fish, livestock, butter, milk and flour.
   East German stores for the past several months have been
spurning homegrown goods in favor of Western products, and the
nation's farm sector has been reeling to the point of collapse.
Farmers have been the most restive section of the workforce.
   About 255,000 tons of meat, 60,000 tons of butter, 5,000 tons of
fish and more than 1 million eggs are included in the contract,
officials said.
   Also included in the deal is the sale of 1 billion cigarettes.
The Soviet Union has been plagued by unrest over shortages of
tobacco.
   The contract was announced by government officials and West
German Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle, who will be in charge of
East Germany's crumbling farm economy after the two nations unify
Oct. 3.
   Officials said deliveries will begin in the next few days and
continue through June.
   Guenther Krause, East Germany's state secretary, called the deal
a ``spectacular contract.''
   East German farms _ Soviet-style collectives that are typically
overstaffed _ have been unable to sell enough goods to cover their
payrolls and operating costs since the nation switched to a free
market July 1.
   West German food chains made deals with East German stores in
March requiring them to stock many Western products, nudging East
German goods off the shelves.
   Farmers have been slaughtering cows and pigs prematurely because
they could not find places to sell them or afford to feed them, and
some economists say perhaps half of a record grain harvest has been
unsold.
   Officials also announced that West German would give about $950
million in aid to the East German agriculture sector.

   The State Department has received confirmation
that Liberian President Samuel Doe has been killed, sources said
today.
   The department said it had been informed by various sources that
Doe died after a weekend shootout with rebel forces.
   State Department sources, who asked not to be identified, said
U.S. officials regard the reports as reliable and consider them
confirmation of Doe's death.
   Department spokesman Mark Dillen said the department had reports
from several sources, including representatives of rebel forces led
by Prince Johnson that Doe ``died from the gunshot wounds he
suffered in the shootout with Prince Johnson.''
   Dillen said he had no further information.

   Two small planes collided and both pilots
were killed, apparently because they were watching a moose on the
ground, investigators and witnesses said Monday.
   The bodies of Richard Halstead, 39, and Lawrence Schneider, 52,
both of Fairbanks, were recovered Sunday, a day after the crash 13
miles east of the Parks Highway near Denali National Park, said
Roger Ellis of the Alaska State Troopers.
   Schneider had relatives hunting moose near the site, but
investigators did not know why Halstead was flying in the area,
Ellis said.
   A party of hunters saw the crash and rode on horseback to notify
troopers in Healy.
   Witnesses said both pilots were circling, seemed to be looking
at the moose and apparently failed to notice each other. Weather
conditions at the time included light winds and visibility of 35
miles.
   ``We could tell from the wreckage that it was almost a head-on
(collision),'' Ellis said. ``Schneider's plane lost a wing and
spiraled into the ground. Halstead's plane was upside down in a
stream and had Schneider's wing attached to it.''

<TEXT>
   In a major step toward ending its
decade-long conflict with Saddam Hussein, Iran has agreed to
formally establish diplomatic relations with Iraq, the official
Iranian news agency said today.
   Also today, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein offered to supply oil
free of charge to Third World countries in what he said was a
gesture of solidarity. However, he said the countries would have to
supply their own tankers, and his statement appeared to be an
attempt to circumvent the U.N. embargo on trade with Iraq.
   Saddam addressed his message to Third World governments, but did
not specify the countries. He said he was making the offer
regardless of the various governments' stands in the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   ``We hereby declare that we are prepared to supply all Third
World countries with oil free of charge in accordance with the
needs of each country,'' Saddam said in his latest televised
message, read by an announcer.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus,
said the agreement between Iran and Iraq on diplomatic tieswas
reached in a meeting between Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati and his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz, who ended a 24-hour
visit to Iran today.
   Diplomatic relations between Iran and Iraq were never officially
severed even though the two countries were at war from 1980 to
1988. They closed their embassies in 1986 and their respective
diplomats returned home, but there was no formal declaration that
relations were broken.
   Diplomats described Aziz' visit as an attempt by Baghdad to get
help beating international trade sanctions imposed on Iraq after it
invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   There were unconfirmed reports that shipments of rice and flour
already were being sent to Iraq via Iran. Such shipments would end
the economic isolation Iraq has suffered under the U.N.-ordered
trade embargo.
   Iran's leaders have said they will honor the embargo, although
they object to the U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia.
   Also today, the Syrian government said it was sending more
troops to Saudi Arabia at the request of the desert kingdom.
   Diplomatic sources estimate that Syria has already sent 4-5,000
elite combat troops to the kingdom, and they expected this figure
to almost double in the near future.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III announced today he will
visit Syria to coordinate the U.S. drive against Iraq with
President Hafez Assad. Syria and the United States have formed a
makeshift alliance during the Persian Gulf crisis despite
differences over human rights and terrorism.
   The official Iraqi News Agency (INA) questioned President Bush's
motives in meeting Sunday with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in Helsinki, Finland. After seven hours of talks, the two
leaders stood firm in demanding an immediate and unconditional
Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, and did not rule out the use of force
if a peaceful solution is not found.
   INA said the summit showed Bush's ``evil tendencies and his
spite for the Arab nation and its central issues, primarily the
tragedy of the Palestinian people, who are suffering under the
Zionist occupation enforced by U.S. support.''
   The United States has led the military and diplomatic effort to
force Iraq to return Kuwait to its former rulers.
   Kuwait Radio, run by the emirate's government-in-exile, reported
Sunday that three member of Saddam's elite Presidential Guard were
executed for plotting to kill him.
   The radio gave no details and did not say when they men were
allegedly shot. Western diplomats in Saudi Arabia said they had
heard similar reports, but were not able to confirm them. Two
Egyptian state newspapers, quoting Western diplomats, said five
officers had been ordered executed.
   In another development, Syria's official news agency reported
that 46 explosions were heard Sunday in the Iraqi town of Al-Qaim
near the boredr between the two countries, resulting in an
undetermined number of casualties. ABC News identified the site of
the blasts as a chemical plant. INA denied the reports.
   Polish workers returning home from Iraq had said about 35
Americans were taken to the chemical plant in Al-Qaim on Aug. 17
under guard. It was not known whether any Westerners were still
being held at the plant.
   Saddam has placed hundreds of Westerners at industrial and
military installations to serve as human shields against possible
attack.
   At the United Nations today, Kuwait's ambassador said Iraqi
occupation forces have intensified their crackdown on Kuwaitis,
killing civilians in the streets and rounding up others in mass
arrests.
   The Iranian news agency, quoting a what it said was a reliable
source, said that ``Aziz, in his talks with Ali Akbar Velayati
called for the restoration of bilateral relations and reopening of
embassies in the two countries.
   ``Officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran gave a positive
response to the Iraqi foreign minister's call and announced their
consent in this connection,'' IRNA said in an English-language
dispatch.
   It quoted the source as saying preparation for the exchange of
diplomatic missions will begin ``in the near future,'' but gave no
other details.
   Aziz flew home today after meeting Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani and Velayati, IRNA reported.
   It was the first visit to Iran by an Iraqi official since the
Islamic revolution seized power in 1979. A year later, the Persian
Gulf war broke out between the two countries.
   An August 1988 cease-fire halted fighting.
   Baghdad began its campaign to improve relations with Tehran
shortly after the U.N. sanctions were ordered.
   Iraq withdrew its troops from Iranian territory it had held
since the cease-fire, began prisoner exchanges and agreed to abide
by a 1975 treaty splitting the Shatt al-Arab waterway with Iran.
   The Shatt-al-Arab is a key outlet to the sea for Iraq.

   The call to duty because of the crisis in the
Middle East means extra anguish for single-parent soldiers, who
must prepare themselves and their children for the worst while
hoping for the best.
   Gary D. Dow, a chief warrant officer with the 94th U.S. Army
Reserve in Massachusetts, has been making those preparations ever
since Iraqi troops marched into neighboring Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Dow, 37, who is divorced and has custody of his 12-year-old son,
Jamie, recalls the day last month when his beeper went off, ruining
a day at the beach.
   It was a call to readiness, not arms, but left Jamie shaken.
   ``We were in a panic, he was very upset,'' Dow said. ``He was
very nervous.''
   Now Jamie watches the television news religiously and peppers
Dow with questions. He waits and watches for a signal that his
father might be sent overseas.
   ``He talks about it daily, asks me what's going on,'' Dow said.
``One night he said, `Dad, I don't want you to get shot.' I told
him that was pretty remote. But he lives with that all the time.''
   Jamie will stay with Dow's parents if his father is sent away.
He will be cared for, clothed and fed, even if the worst happens.
   ``I'm not raising my hand and volunteering,'' Dow said. ``I have
my son. He's my priority. I have a mission and a duty. I'll go if
I'm asked to go. But I'd rather be a last resort.''
   Maj. Doug Hart, a Defense Department spokesman, said there are
55,093 ``sole parent sponsors'' in the U.S. armed forces _ 37,257
men and 17,836 women.
   Though he did not have figures for past years, Hart said ``it
would be a fair assumption that that number has risen. You could
parallel the increase in single parents in the civilian population
with the military population.''
   Hart said all single-parent soldiers must designate a legal
guardian for their children in the event the parents are called to
active duty. Such arrangements are made on a base-by-base level.
Day care and counseling services are also sometimes available.
   But, Army Capt. Barbara Goodno points out, the military isn't a
nursery school _ or the Boy Scouts.
   ``The most important thing to remember is single parents along
with everyone else in the military volunteered for service,''
Goodno said. ``They indicated that they would be prepared for
worldwide missions.''
   In at least one case, a soldier is accused of failing to
properly provide for his children before reporting for duty.
   Staff Sgt. Faagalo Savaiki, called up Aug. 29 with his Fort
Campbell, Ky., unit, is accused of leaving his three children
without food but with a note taped to the wall telling the two boys
and a girl how to use an automatic teller card to withdraw money
from a bank.
   Savaiki, divorced from his wife who now lives in Hawaii, pleaded
innocent last week in Clarksville, Tenn., to three misdemeanor
child abuse charges. Authorities said the children might be
reunited with their mother or other family members.
   Sgt. Christina Rosales, with the Fresno, Calif.-based National
Guard's 2668th Transportation Co., waits each day for the call to
take up arms, and each day she ponders the fate of her two small
children.
   If called to fight, Rosales' 8-year-old daughter will be left
with her ex-husband and her 14-month-old son will stay with her
boyfriend.
   Rosales, 30, has been sequestered at the guard armory the last
two weeks getting ready for active duty. She said her daughter
``cries a lot now. She's used to being told when mommy's coming
home. But I can't tell her that, because I don't know.''
   ``I've tried to explain some of this to her, but I'm afraid of
saying too much because it will just make her more afraid.''
   Of her son, she said, ``He's just a baby. That really scares
me.''

<TEXT>
   Presidents Bush and Gorbachev may not be on a
``George'' and ``Mikhail'' basis, but their relationship seems to
be evolving into a comfortable one _ especially now that they've
ended a summit as allies.
   Bush's personal encounters with Gorbachev remain a little on the
staid side by Bush's usual standards for palling around with world
leaders, associates of the president suggest.
   But the two leaders seem to be settling in and getting used to
each other. And, by their own accounts, the presidents of the
world's two superpowers say they trust each other more and more.
   ``At each meeting we move forward, we enrich our relationship,''
Mikhail S. Gorbachev said after the two leaders ended their Sunday
summit in Helsinki with a statement of unity condemning Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait.
   ``And I think I should say that we increased our trust,''
Gorbachev added.
   Bush, who voiced skepticism toward the Soviet leader's motives
early in his term and whose press spokesman once called Gorbachev a
``drugstore cowboy,'' now says the two have reached a level of
``mutual understanding.''
   ``Neither of us, when we talk, try to hide our differences,''
Bush said at Sunday's concluding news conference with Gorbachev.
``Neither of us try to indicate that we look at exactly every
problem exactly the same way. But the very fact that we can talk
with that degree of frankness without rancor, I think, enhances
mutual understanding.''
   Later, Bush told reporters aboard Air Force One that Gorbachev
``felt confident, he projected a certain confidence.''
   Even in discussing economic problems within the Soviet Union,
Gorbachev ``felt very open about doing it,'' Bush said.
   The informality of last December's shipboard summit at Malta and
pitching horseshoes together at Camp David in June helped nurture
their developing relationship, the president suggested.
   Even so, there's little hint that the two presidents are
developing into fast friends or that they are able to wile away
their hours in small talk. It's just not that kind of relationship.
   In fact, personal relations between the two men remain a bit on
the formal side, largely because Gorbachev is inclined to want to
get right down to work, say aides who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   Don't expect to see Gorbachev out on the golf course or on a
tennis court with Bush, or riding the waves in the U.S. president's
speedboat.
   White House insiders said that, when Bush and Gorbachev meet,
there is little banter between the two about family, sports or the
myriad other subjects that Bush enjoys discussing with other world
leaders.
   Gorbachev reportedly showed little interest in visiting Bush's
vacation home on the Maine coast during his visit here earlier this
year.
   They did pitch horseshoes together, but the game was brief _ and
perhaps partly arranged for the photo it produced, which for a
while Bush hung on the wall of the presidential jet.
   When the two greet each other, it's not by first names but as
``Mr. President.''
   Bush's predecessor, Ronald Reagan, started off referring to the
Soviet Union as the ``evil empire'' and wound up with a
relationship with Gorbachev that even Bush has hinted was a bit too
cozy.
   Reagan told the Soviet leader he wanted to be on a ``Ron'' and
``Mikhail'' basis. But it never caught on with Gorbachev, who
continued to address Reagan as ``Mr. President.''
   Bush and Gorbachev seem to be growing more comfortable in each
other's presence, both on camera and off.
   When they met Sunday at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki to
begin seven hours of Persian Gulf summitry, Gorbachev presented
Bush with a framed copy of a Soviet cartoon depicting the two
leaders as boxing champs, arms uplifted, standing over a supine
figure labelled ``Cold War'' in Russian. ``That's wonderful,'' Bush
said.
   Later, at their news conference, Bush hit the side of his
microphone at one point when it seemed to fail. ``Hit it again,''
Gorbachev to him.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that
worldwide support for the unity expressed by Gorbachev and Bush at
the weekend summit ``has been overwhelmingly supportive and almost
euphoric.''
   ``It's a very important source of strength for many countries
around the world who have had ties in both countries or had
relationships one way or another to have this happen,'' Fitzwater
said.
   And, while Bush seems cautious in expressing too much
satisfaction with his blooming relationship with the Soviet leader,
he says, ``I don't know how one quantifies mutual understanding,
but I feel we're moving on the right track.''

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Environmentalists' Bid to Block Home Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FLIPPEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Monday ruled that the sale of
homes in the Love Canal chemical dump neighborhood may go ahead,
rejecting a bid by environmental and community groups to block the
sales.
   State Justice Joseph Mintz lifted an injunction he imposed four
years ago to block the sales. He said the environmental groups had
no standing to intervene.
   The injunction, which Mintz had imposed at the request of the
state attorney general's office, forbade the Love Canal Area
Revitalization Agency from selling homes near the notorious toxic
waste site until the state Health Department had studied whether
the area was habitable.
   Love Canal became a symbol of the nation's toxic waste problems
in the late 1970s when chemicals dumped there 30 years earlier
began leaking into yards and basements. Hooker Chemical Co. had
dumped 22,000 tons of chemical wastes that included toxic dioxins
and PCBs into the former Love Canal before it was filled in and the
town grew over the site.
   An estimated 2,500 people fled their homes.
   The Health Department study, which was finished last year, said
chemical contamination in a part of the Love Canal area was no
worse than in other parts of Niagara Falls.
   That was meaningless without measuring toxicity in those other
parts of the city, environmentalists protested. ``They never
determined that those comparative areas were safe,'' argued Richard
J. Lippes, a lawyer for the environmental groups.
   Paul H. Reid, the revitalization agency's lawyer, said there was
no way to make an absolute determination that any area was safe.
   ``There actually do not exist the kinds of standards that Mr.
Lippes would like us to supply,'' Reid said.
   Lippes also argued that the revitalization agency had not
complied with other environmental studies required by state law.
   Mintz said those other studies were irrelevant to his original
restraining order.
   ``I decided some four years ago that this was an issue of health
and welfare of prospective inhabitants,'' the judge said. ``I have
papers before me that raise issues of fauna and animal life, and
architectural integrity, that have nothing to do with this lawsuit.
Nothing whatever.''
   William L. Broderick, the revitalization agency's executive
director, said the ruling was gratifying but not unexpected.
   The agency last month put 10 houses near the canal on the
market, the first of about 250 that it plans to renovate and sell.
   Agency officials said last week they had received offers on five
of the 10 so far, and Broderick said the agency hopes to start
closing on those houses soon.
   Lippes said after the hearing there was no way to appeal Mintz'
ruling, but that it left open the option of filing a separate
lawsuit on the same issues. He said the groups, including the
Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and local
community organizations, also would seek a federal court injunction
to stop the resettlement.

   ``Godfather'' co-star James Caan
has married a third time, to a woman who grew up a few blocks from
his home in New York City.
   But she wasn't even born when Caan was attending PS 150, the
high school where they both graduated 20 years apart.
   Caan, 49, and Ingrid Hajek, 29, were married Sunday aboard the
yacht Regentsea in Marina Del Rey, said Paul Bloch, a spokesman for
the actor.
   Bloch said Caan and Mrs. Hajek, who were raised in the same
Sunnyside neighborhood in Queens, met two years ago when they were
introduced by mutual friends. It is her second marriage.
   Caan was nominated for an Academy Award in 1972 for best
supporting actor for his role as Sonny Corleone in ``The
Godfather.'' His next film, ``Misery,'' is scheduled for release in
November.
   Rob Reiner, director of ``Misery,'' and actor Elliot Gould were

<TEXT>
   More Americans know their cholesterol
level, but fewer know their blood pressure and some doctors are
concerned that people don't understand the whole picture, according
to a survey released Monday.
   ``With all the attention given to cholesterol, blood pressure,
diet, smoking and exercise, there is a chance that consumers will
become confused,'' said Dr. Edward Frohlich, vice president for
academic affairs at Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation in New Orleans.
   ``Consumers should realize that it's not only the person with
elevated cholesterol, or the person with high blood pressure, or
the individual who smokes or has hereditary predisposition,''
Frohlich said. ``All are risk factors, and frequently they all
coexist in the same person.''
   The survey, commissioned by Voluntary Hospitals of America Inc.,
found that 40 percent of Americans age 20 and older know their
cholesterol level, an increase of 8 percent from a similar survey
last year. The new survey found 59 percent know their blood
pressure, a decline of 5 percentage points from last year.
   Voluntary Hospitals commissioned the Gallup survey to evaluate
Americans' awareness of heart disease risk factors. The alliance of
not-for-profit hospitals sponsors Thursday's scheduled ``Countdown
USA: The National Heart Check,'' a one-day nationwide screening and
educational program.
   The third-annual screening will be conducted by the group's 430
member hospitals at various sites around the country. The screening
will include questionnaires on family history, and tests for blood
pressure and total blood cholesterol.
   The Gallup organization questioned 967 adults above age 20
between May 14 and May 20. The survey's margin of error is plus or
minus 4 percentage points.
   Other findings include:
   _ Only 22 percent of adult Americans believe they are at high
risk for heart disease, although 41 percent say a family member has
been diagnosed with heart disease. Family history of heart disease
is an important risk factor, the association noted.
   _ Younger Americans, between ages 20 and 34, are even less
concerned, as only 16 percent of that age group believe they are at
high risk. The association said nearly half of all Americans die of
heart disease or stroke.
   _ Forty-five percent of adults said they have changed their
eating habits within the past two years to lower their cholesterol
level.
   _ Seven of 10 adults say they have had their cholesterol level
checked, an increase of 4 points since last year.
   _ Twenty-four percent said they have been told they have high
blood pressure or hypertension, with 11 percent being treated for
it.
   _ And 27 percent of Americans said they smoke, while 65 percent
exercise at least twice a week.

   Energy Department officials cautiously
predicted Monday that fuel oil supplies will be adequate this
winter _ but only if the weather isn't severe, if refineries avoid
operating problems and if Mideast developments don't disrupt oil
shipments further.
   Several congressmen complained that the assessment was based on
``rosy assumptions'' and suggested that it provides little comfort
to Americans relying on oil to heat homes and factories.
   ``There now is a very small margin of safety,'' said Rep. Philip
Sharp, D-Ind. and chairman of the House energy and power
subcommittee. The Energy Department ``tends to underestimate what
can go wrong,'' he complained.
   Calvin A. Kent, head of the department's Energy Information
Administration, told Sharp's subcommittee that the supply of
refined petroleum products _ gasoline, heating oil and jet fuel _
will be tight with refineries producing near their capacities.
   But he said U.S. petroleum stocks ``appear adequate.'' The
agency estimated that while the worldwide crude oil shortage is
expected to still be about 1 million barrels a day during the last
three months of the year ``the shortage can be handled'' as higher
prices dampen demand.
   But Kent said significant supply problems could emerge if
developments in the Mideast further reduce supplies or if the
winter is abnormally cold. Operational problems at refineries,
which have been running at better than 96 percent of capacity, and
extensive hoarding could cause localized shortages, he suggested.
   The agency collects and analyzes world energy data.
   Sharp and several other congressmen reiterated their call for
President Bush to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
The president should consider ``at least a modest'' drawdown of the
590-million barrel reserve ``to get confidence up and hopefully
force prices down,'' Sharp said.
   The Bush administration has said tapping the reserve is not
needed at this time. Energy Department officials said last week the
reserves will be used if there are ``significant supply
interruptions.''
   Rep. Terry Bruce, D-Ill., said he was ``nervous'' about the slim
margin in refining capacity. ``I fear we will run out of heating
oil, gasoline and jet fuel,'' said Bruce.
   But Kent said the capacity to refine crude both in the United
States and elsewhere ``appears to be adequate ... and will remain
so over the next three to six months.''
   He said Kuwait's refining capacity could be replaced by
increases elsewhere and rejected suggestions by some energy experts
that the heavier crude that will replace the oil lost from Iraq and
Kuwait might cause refinery operating problems.
   Dewey Mark, speaking for the National Petroleum Refiners
Association, said he wasn't as certain that lost imports of refined
products could be made up. ``The supply balance is tight.''
   ``As a refinery, when you're operating at 90 percent you're
effectively running wide open,'' he told the subcommittee.
   Kent gave these assessments on the expected supply of various
refined crude oil products:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Heating Oil</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Current stocks are ``well above normal'' and rising. Supplies in
the Northeast, which relies heavily on oil to heat homes and
factories, are 16 percent above last year. The stocks ``appear to
be adequate barring any unusually cold weather or refinery
breakdowns.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Gasoline</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Localized supply problems could develop. Inventories are at the
lowest level since July 1988 _ 5.9 million barrels above the
operating inventory required to prevent shortages. But the stocks,
while tight, ``should be adequate to see us through the fourth
quarter.'' His assessment did not extend into 1991.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Jet Fuel</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Supply is above last year's levels but still tight and problems
could develop late in the winter. Demand from the military is
300,000 barrels a day greater than normal because of the Persian
Gulf deployment.

<TEXT>
   Miss America 1991, Marjorie Judith Vincent, said
Monday she is most concerned about problems affecting battered
women and that as a lawyer she would offer free legal advice to
women who need her help.
   Speaking at a news conference, the former Miss Illinois said the
problem of battered women is not receiving enough attention.
   ``We need more organizations to help these women, more shelters
and better rehabilitation programs for abusers because the problem
won't be solved by just giving women a place to live. We have to
get at the root of the problem and find a way to help the abusers,
too,'' she said.
   Vincent, 25, of Oak Park, Ill., a tree-lined Chicago suburb,
said she became involved in the issue after talking to a woman
staying at a Chicago shelter for abused women.
   ``She told horrible stories about women who just can't get out
of these situations,'' she said.
   A third-year law student at Duke University and a concert
pianist, Vincent will take a year off from school to fulfill her
duties as Miss America.
   She was crowned Saturday night in a nationally televised pageant
that was notable, in part, for the return of host Bert Parks, who
flubbed his lines when two pages of his script stuck together.
   Vincent, whose parents fled poverty in Haiti 27 years ago,
defended the pageant, which handed her a crown and a $36,500
scholarship. ``I don't see this as a beauty pageant. It's an
educational program,'' she said.
   She said pageant directors no longer stifle Miss Americas from
speaking out on issues that were once taboo, such as premarital
sex, homosexuality or abortion. She strongly supports freedom of
choice on both topics.

for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.74
percent last week, down from 7.85 percent the previous week.

   Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy dropped out of the
governor's race Monday after her mutiny against Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis ignited rebellion in her own camp.
   The stunning reversal came less than a week after Murphy tried
to prove she could lead state government, seizing the crown of
acting governor when Dukakis went to Europe on a week-long trade
mission.
   Murphy proposed various steps to slash state spending and solve
the government's fiscal woes. But those maneuvers, which were
blasted as a political stunt designed to rescue her campaign,
caused a wave of defections from within her ranks.
   Announcing her withdrawal from the Democratic race at the same
podium where she revealed the budget proposals Friday, Murphy said:
``Now there can be no confusion. This is not a political ploy. It
is an honest and necessary act of leadership.''
   But Murphy campaign staffers said the main reason for the
withdrawal was the simple fact that she could not win.
   Michael Goldman, a campaign strategist, said surveys conducted
over the weekend showed Murphy's support growing, but not enough to
land her the nomination in the Sept. 18 primary.
   He said Murphy made the decision Monday morning, and aides
relayed it to one of her rivals, former state Attorney General
Francis Bellotti, who has been leading in opinion polls.
   Murphy said she would support Bellotti, adding ``he comes
closest to the values that are important to me.''
   There was no discussion about giving Murphy a job if Bellotti
should win, Goldman said.
   The third Democratic candidate is Boston University
president-on-leave John Silber, who has staked out the conservative
wing of the Democratic Party along with independent voters.
   Mruphy's announcement came on the same day that Boston Mayor
Raymond Flynn, along with other leading liberals, said he would
back Bellotti.
   Murphy had portrayed herself as a champion of the liberal wing
of the party. But her support had begun disintegrating even before
last week's revolt.
   Murphy took command of state government when Dukakis left on a
trade mission to Europe. Before his departure, she said she was
waiting for him to leave so she could seize control of the state's
ailing finances. Dukakis postponed the trip briefly, then decided
to leave after warning that he would return if Murphy took any
drastic actions.
   Murphy's budget-cutting plans, which she predicted would save up
to $150 million, included executive orders to fire an estimated
1,000 workers and cut salaries for others. Murphy also asked
agencies to cut their 1992 budgets 10 percent below spending levels
for the current fiscal year.
   Murphy reviewed those plans Monday with L. Edward Lashman, the
state secretary of administration and finance.
   Last week, Lashman said the projected savings under Murphy's
proposals were highly inflated. Administration officials also said
the orders requiring personnel cuts could not take effect before
Dukakis returns Friday, and the governor could undo those orders.
   Dukakis had issued his own budget-cutting orders before the
revolt, and administration officials said during the weekend they
were still following the governor's instructions.

   Federal health officials on Monday formed an
office to monitor, coordinate and enhance research on women's
health, responding to pressure from members of Congress.
   Announcement of the new office at the National Institutes of
Health came on the heels of word that a woman, Cleveland
cardiologist Dr. Bernadine P. Healy, is the leading candidate to
head NIH.
   At a meeting of NIH officials and members of the Congressional
Caucus for Women's Issues, NIH acting Director William Raub said
researchers ``recognize the need to include women in clinical
studies and to be attentive to women's health concerns.''
   ``NIH will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that
appropriate numbers of women are included in research projects''
funded by the institutes, he said.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., co-chairwoman of the caucus,
said NIH officials have been ``very responsive of late'' to
concerns about a lack of women included in experimental drug tests
and their call for more attention to women's health issues.
   But she sought guarantees that the politics of such
controversial health issues as abortion won't impede NIH efforts to
address women's health concerns.
   ``The huge, raging political debate over reproduction'' has been
a major obstacle to contraceptive research.
   ``I can understand why a lot of researchers would just as soon
not walk out into that area,'' she said. ``It's affected research
across the board dealing with women.''
   With the new Office of Women's Health Research in place and
stronger requirements that NIH-funded research projects include
more women, ``we're going to be able to move forward,'' Schroeder
said.
   Raub acknowledged the political dilemma and said, ``we will have
to be prepared to wrestle with ethics ... and we're prepared to
confront that.''
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., pressed Raub and Dr. James Mason,
assistant secretary of health in the Department of Health and Human
Services, about a timetable for getting the new office running and
making the other efforts.
   ``We're looking for action plans,'' she said.
   When Mason assured her that NIH officials were committed to
carrying through with their plans, she said: ``I don't think that's
good enough,'' and pressed for a timetable.
   Mason said he wanted officials to take the time necessary to
come up with the best possible plan. ``We want quality,'' he said.
Mikulski shot back: ``We want action.''
   One of the reasons researchers have been reluctant to include
women in clinical trials of new drug therapies is concern that if
they became pregnant, their fetus could be harmed.
   ``I think there has been timidity in the past, perhaps related
to the Thalidomide disaster and its effect on women during
pregnancy,'' Mason said, referring to birth defects caused by the
drug.
   However, he added, ``that doesn't mean it shouldn't be done. I
think it's clear it must be done.''
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute on Allergy
and Infectious Disease, the lead institute on AIDS research, said
one hindrance to including women in tests of experimental AIDS
drugs is the lack of access to health care by the bulk of women who
are getting the disease. Many of the women becoming infected are
intravenous drug abusers or the sexual partners of drug abusers,
who are at high risk of contracting AIDS.
   With no connection to the health care system, researchers have a
difficult time finding infected women to participate in clinical
trials, he said.
   Dr. Ruth Kirschstein, director of the National Institute of
General Medical Sciences, was appointed acting head of the Office
of Women's Health Research.
   Dr. Bernadine P. Healy, 46, research director of the Cleveland
Clinic Foundation, is Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan's choice to head NIH, according to HHS sources who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
   Her name has not been sent to the White House, but it was
expected to be, the sources said. If confirmed by the Senate, she
would become the first woman in that post.
   Healy was a member of an NIH advisory committee that recommended
government approval of fetal tissue transplantation research. The
recommendation was rejected by the Reagan and Bush administrations.

   Eleanor Holmes Norton said Monday she won't be
chased from the race for the District of Columbia's non-voting
House seat by revelations that she filed no local income tax
returns for eight years.
   ``I am in this race to stay,'' Norton said at a campaign rally
on the eve of the district's Democratic primary.
   ``Those that think they could chase this woman out of this race
... don't know a fighter when they see one.''
   Norton, a Georgetown University law professor, had been the
front-runner in the campaign for the Democratic nomination to
succeed Walter E. Fauntroy, who is seeking the party's nomination
for mayor in Tuesday's primary.
   But her campaign for the last three days has been trying to
explain why she filed no local tax returns from 1982 through 1989.
   On Monday, The Washington Post endorsed veteran city council
member Betty Ann Kane for the Democratic nomination. The paper said
it had been prepared to endorse Norton until her tax problems
became public.
   Norton's failure to file returns is ``not just disabling, it is
disqualifying,'' the newspaper said.
   Jesse Jackson, who is running for an unpaid ``shadow'' Senate
seat to lobby Congress for D.C. statehood, also had been set to
endorse Norton but changed his mind in light of the weekend
developments, Jackson aides said.
   ``He just couldn't do it now,'' said one Jackson aide who asked
not to be identified. ``They are old colleagues, but there are too
many unanswered questions.''
   Norton, who headed the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission during the Carter administration, has said that she
signed tax returns prepared by her husband, Edward, for the years
1982 through 1987. She said she was unaware that he had not mailed
them to the city government.
   Norton said she even asked her husband, ``Are the taxes in, and
he said, `Yes.' If I had knowingly done this, why would I be
running?''
   Norton also said she has overpaid her taxes, and that the city
owes her a refund for an unspecified portion of the nearly $50,000
in local income taxes that was withheld from her pay during that
eight-year period. This weekend, she sent the city a check for the
more than $25,000 she owed in connection with a 1982 tax dispute.

   Terry Waite, the Anglican Church envoy held
hostage in Beirut for more than 3{ years, has been ill but is
alive, released Irish hostage Brian Keenan said Monday.
   ``He was in the same apartment as I was being held in,'' Keenan
said in an interview with Britain's Independent Television News.
Waite's cousin, John Waite, said this was the first confirmation in
more than three years that Terry was alive. ``It is wonderful
news,'' he said.
   Keenan, 39, was released last month after 4{ years in captivity.
ITN said Keenan had not previously revealed information about Waite
because the hostages had a pact to tell hostages' families of their
conditions first.
   Keenan said he heard the guards calling Waite by his first name.
He said he is sure they were talking to Waite, and not Terry
Anderson, because he heard Waite speak and recognized his English
accent.
   ``I know Terry Waite is alive. I know he has been ill and the
illness I do not think is serious,'' Keenan said.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie said the news would ``put
fresh heart'' into attempts to free the 13 remaining hostages in
Beirut. They include six Americans, among them Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985 and is the longest-held captive.
   Waite, 51, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west
Beirut hotel to negotiate with the Moslem extremist group Islamic
Jihad for the release of hostages. No group has claimed to hold
Waite, but he is widely believed held by Islamic Jihad.
   Keenan, from Northern Ireland, was interviewed at a retreat in
Ireland's County Donegal, Keenan said he believed that during his
illness, Waite had ``frequent visits from the captors and from
senior officers.''
   Waite, he said, ``had been kept for a long time in a room in
which there was a small generator to generate electricity because
the power situation in Lebanon ... they don't have any.
   ``So he was sitting listening to this for nearly six hours a
day, pounding, pounding, pounding in his ear.''
   Keenan said he knew Waite had been ill because ``I heard him
coughing very heavily at night. I heard him being addressed by the
guards as `Terry.'
   ``We always counted the number of people being taken to the
toilet. We knew there was another hostage. They called him Terry
and we knew it wasn't Terry Anderson.
   ``Although we didn't visually see him, we heard and I could hear
under the door. His door was adjacent to mine.
   ``In the room he was being kept I heard his English accent. It
sounds to me like it's Terry Waite's voice. I know he is a
soft-spoken man.''
   Keenan said he knew Waite's voice and accent because before he
left to take a university teaching post in Beirut, he saw Waite
interviewed on television.
   Keenan said his captors told him that the British hostages could
be free within months. ``The door is wide open,'' he said. ``There
is something happening, there is a change in the organization that
is holding (the hostages).''
   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., John Waite
urged the British government to ``redouble'' its efforts to free
hostages.
   John Lyttle, a spokesman for the archbishop of Canterbury, said
Keenan's statement was ``very plain evidence'' that Terry Waite is
alive.
   ``I think there are considerable indications from Tehran that
they are anxious now to dispose of this problem altogether, to use
their influence to bring about the release of the remaining
hostages and I think there are reasonable hopes of progress fairly
soon,'' Lyttle said.

   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos called
Monday for close scrutiny of operations at 60 schools with high
student loan default rates, as well as the policies of seven
agencies overseeing the troubled institutions.
   Cavazos said a new analysis of student loan data showed more
than 30 percent of all defaulted loans _ $365 million _ was owed by
borrowers who attended less than 1 percent of the nation's 10,000
postsecondary institutions. The borrowers were to begin repaying
their guaranteed student loans two years ago.
   The majority of the 60 schools are technical trade or vocational
institutions that are accredited by seven of the nation's more than
100 accrediting agencies.
   Cavazos originally targeted 89 institutions but 28 have closed
and one, the USA Training Academy, Home Study of Delaware, is
inactive because it no longer receives federal funds.
   Cavazos said the federal advisory committee that oversees
accrediting agencies has been directed to scrutinize the policies
of the seven agencies.
   The secretary's latest action comes as the Education Department
struggles to keep afloat the Higher Education Assistance
Foundation, a private, non-profit agency based in Overland Park,
Kan., which is the guarantor of $8.8 billion in students loans, or
more than 17 percent of the $51 billion student loans outstanding
nationally.
   The total of student loan defaults is $7.8 billion, of which
$1.9 billion was added last year. An estimated $12 billion will be
loaned to some 5 million students during the 1990 fiscal year.
   The federal advisory panel, the National Advisory Committee on
Accreditation and Institutional Eligibility, recommends to the
secretary which accrediting agencies should be recognized. The
agencies in turn accredit schools so they can participate in
federal student aid programs.
   Cavazos directed Leonard Haynes III, assistant secretary for
postsecondary education, to meet with heads of the accrediting
agencies and urge them to review their policies and procedures for
institutional accreditation.
   ``It is reasonable to expect that the level of student loan
defaults at a school is related to the quality of its program,''
said Cavazos. ``I am convinced that any accrediting agency that
takes its role seriously must focus on educational effectiveness
and must be concerned that institutions with high default rates are
held accountable.''
   The accrediting agencies are The Accrediting Bureau of Health
Education Schools; The Accrediting Council for Continuing Education
and Training; The Association of Independent Colleges and Schools,
Accrediting Commission; The National Accrediting Commission of
Cosmetology Arts and Sciences; The National Association of Trade
and Technical Schools, Accrediting Commission; The National Home
Study Council, Accrediting Council; and the Southern Association of
Colleges and Schools, Commission on Occupational Education
Institutions.
   Cavazos said the department is conducting program or
administration review of the 89 institutions that remain open.
   The highest default institutions included Cambridge Technical
Institute, Dayton, Ohio, with an 81.5 percent default rate
amounting to $8.3 million; and Sawyer College, Cleveland Heights,
Ohio, with a 79.9 percent default rate amounting to $1.8 million.
   Also Metils Welding School, Houston, Texas, with a 69 percent
rate at $4.1 million; the Vocational Training Center, St. Louis,
Mo., with a 68 percent rate at $3.7 million, and Tarkio College in
Tarkio, Mo., with a 67.3 percent rate totaling $4.3 million.

   Homesick U.S. troops in the Middle East would
be able to send letters to relatives and friends for no charge
under legislation proposed Monday.
   Rep. William Ford, D-Mich., chairman of the House Post Office
and Civil Service Committee, introduced the bill and scheduled a
hearing for Wednesday. He said he hoped for a House vote early next
week.
   Lawmakers who visited the troops in Saudi Arabia last month
heard frequent pleas for less red tape in sending mail, Ford said.
   ``Our men and women are getting their mail OK,'' he said. ``But
they're having a problem sending letters home because they can't
get postage anywhere. We're going to solve that problem with this
bill.''
   The legislation would apply only to mail sent from the Middle
East to the United States. It would cover letters, post cards, and
audio and video cassettes but not other parcels.
   Under current law that dates from World War I, troops get free
mailing privileges only during combat.
   The Postal Service's preliminary estimate is that the free
mailing would cost taxpayers $500,000 a month, Ford's office said.

   Arab intelligence reports indicate Iraq's plan
of attack was ``far more ambitious'' than taking Kuwait and that
Saddam Hussein talked with other Arab leaders about ``splitting the
spoils,'' Rep. Les AuCoin, said Monday.
   AuCoin, D-Ore., a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on
Defense who returned Sunday night from a trip to the Persian Gulf,
said Arab officials told the delegation of ``conversations Saddam
Hussein had with other Arab leaders outside Saudi Arabia to buy
into this'' plan of attack.
   He said the other leaders ``rebuffed'' Hussein's offers.
   ``They were talking about splitting the spoils. ... It was an
operation far more ambitious than Kuwait. I can't say any more,''
AuCoin said.
   He said he and other members of a congressional delegation to
the gulf area concluded that the attack on Kuwait ``was a precursor
to a move on the Saudi oil fields.''
   ``His ends are very clear,'' he said of Saddam. ``I am convinced
if it had not been for the early military buildup ... the Iraqis
would have marched right beyond the Saudi border and seized the
Saudi Arabian oil fields.''
   ``What threw Hussein off guard was that he could not believe the
Saudis would ever allow U.S. deployment of forces there,'' he said.
   AuCoin also said that U.S. and Arab intelligence reports
indicate the trade embargo may well knock Saddam from power by the
end of the year.
   ``It is not absolutely inevitable, but there is a strong
possibility that increased sanctions could put enough heat on this
guy to cause him to be toppled,'' the congressman said at a news
conference.
   AuCoin said before he arrived in the Persian Gulf he was under
the impression that Saudi Arabia wanted U.S. troops there to direct
a pre-emptive strike on Iraq.
   ``But I was encouraged by the consensus there of every one of
the Arab nations... that the embargo ought to be allowed to play
out before a military strike,'' he said.

   Allowing humanitarian food aid into Iraq may
lead to enough illicit trade with the Persian Gulf nation to help
Saddam Hussein hang on longer in Kuwait, U.S. analysts Monday.
   But it also relieves Iraq's critics of the moral dilemma of
threatening innocent civilians with starvation in order to put
pressure on Saddam, they said.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed
at their summit meeting Sunday in Helsinki, Finland, that a
month-old U.N. embargo against Iraq permits food shipments ``in
humanitarian circumstances,'' especially to feed children.
   The United Nations Security Council must define ``humanitarian
circumstances,'' but in the meantime some nations are likely to act
on their own, analysts said.
   ``Countries for one reason or another may use the cover of this
humanitarian aid to break the embargo,'' said Shireen Hunter, a
Middle East scholar at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a private research group.
   ``This is indeed a dilemma'' for Bush as he seeks to keep a
tight economic noose around Iraq in order to compel Saddam to
withdraw his occupying army from Kuwait, she said. Iraq invaded on
Aug. 2 and annexed the tiny kingdom six days later.
   More than a month after the U.N. Security Council voted to ban
trade with Iraq, it is unclear how long it might take for the
embargo to cause substantial hardship for Iraq.
   Judith Kipper, a Middle East expert at the Brookings
Institution, a research group, said she sees ``less than a 50
percent chance'' the embargo will work. But Rep. John Murtha,
D-Pa., said Sunday after returning with other lawmakers from a
visit to Saudi Arabia that the sanctions could topple Saddam within
two months.
   Iraq imported about 80 percent of its food last year.
   Analysts said leakage in the embargo as a result of a
humanitarian ``loophole'' is likely to be small, but it may be
enough to extend Saddam's grip on power. That, in turn, may mean a
longer stay in the Saudi Arabian desert for the tens of thousands
of American troops that Bush dispatched last month.
   Unconfirmed reports from the Middle East on Monday said some
shipments of rice and flour already were flowing into Iraq from
Iran. The two countries, which were at war from 1980-88, announced
they were restoring diplomatic relations.
   In Brussels, Belgium on Monday, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III told reporters that Arab governments consulted by
Washington in recent days believe ``Iran will continue to abide by
the international consensus and respect the embargo.''
   Bush, apparently worried that Sunday's summit announcement would
be seen as a weakening of U.S. resolve against Iraq, said, ``I hope
that nobody around the world interprets this as our view that now
there should be wholesale food shipments to Iraq.''
   Last week, China and Iran indicated they might begin sending
food and medicine to Iraq. Several other countries, including
Tunisia, Yugoslavia, Romania and India, have said they might send
emergency food to their citizens trapped in Kuwait.
   Bush and Gorbachev stressed that any shipments must be monitored
by international agencies in order to ensure that the food gets to
the intended people.
   Saddam has repeatedly attacked Bush for spearheading the U.N.
embargo, saying the cutoff of food was endangering the lives of
children. By agreeing that limited food shipments can go forward,
the U.S. and Soviet leaders took away a propaganda tool and averted
a possible moral problem.
   A Red Cross official said Monday that the Geneva-based relief
organization saw no evidence that people in Iraq or Kuwait were
starving or being deprived of medicines.
   ``It is not at a critical stage,'' said Ann Stingle, a
spokeswoman for the American Red Cross in Washington. She said the
organization's assessment was based on the firsthand observations
of a delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
which spent three days in Baghdad last week in an unsuccessful
attempt to win Iraqi government approval for a Red Cross relief
role there.
   Mrs. Stingle said the Red Cross will not participate in
monitoring deliveries of U.N.-sponsored humanitarian food shipments
to Iraq until the government agrees to permit the Red Cross to help
all segments of the civilian population there.

   The mayors of Moscow and Leningrad called Monday
for abandoning the traditional celebration of Revolution Day on
Nov. 7, saying shortages and long lines give Russians nothing to
celebrate this year.
   The anniversary of the 1917 revolution is one of the major
holidays on the Soviet calendar, a day usually devoted to praising
the glories of communism.
   But this year, instead of plastering cities with propaganda
posters and carrying giant portraits of Marx, Engels and Lenin
through the streets, the mayors suggested that Russians spend the
day planting bushes and insulating buildings for winter.
   ``It's obvious to us that in 1990, the traditional celebration
and traditional decorating of cities for Nov. 7 is unacceptable,''
Gavriil Popov of Moscow and Anatoly Sobchak of Leningrad said in an
open letter to city councils throughout Russia.
   ``The entire current situation _ crisis in the economy,
difficulties in gathering the harvest, shortages and lines _ does
not lend itself to any sort of exultation,'' they wrote.
   Moscow, Leningrad, Volgograd, Tula, Archangel and other cities
across the Soviet Union are suffering bread shortages for the first
time in decades. Although a record grain harvest of 215 million
tons is expected, poor transportation and lack of fuel have slowed
the process of getting the grain to market.
   Supplies of meat, paper and gasoline have also grown tight,
causing long lines and sending black market prices soaring. A
shortage of tobacco this summer led to street protests in several
cities and rationing in Moscow.
   Popov and Sobchak added that they were calling on Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to limit the festivities in Moscow
to a military parade. There was no immediate response from the
president's office.
   In the past, Revolution Day has been marked in the capital by a
parade of military equipment, including tanks and rockets, followed
by a vast ``people's demonstration'' in which hundreds of thousands
of Moscow residents streamed through the city's main avenues and
across Red Square.
   There, at the heart of Soviet power, members of the Communist
Party's ruling Politburo and top generals stood on Lenin's tomb.
   A few years ago, the mayors' proposal to skip the celebration in
favor of a utilitarian effort to prepare for winter would have been
considered sacrilege.
   But in the atmosphere of Gorbachev's reforms, many Soviet
citizens have become openly irreverent toward symbols and
celebrations of communist power.
   Since they blame communism for economic backwardness and decades
of political repression, they feel little inclination to celebrate
the day the Bolsheviks seized power _ Oct. 25 by the old Czarist
calendar, Nov. 7 by the new one introduced after the revolution.
   May Day, another major Soviet holiday, was marked this year by
counter-demonstrations involving tens of thousands of people in
Moscow. As they passed through Red Square, many shouted ``Resign!''
and jeered at Gorbachev. He stood stoically for 20 minutes and then
left the reviewing stand.
   Popov and Sobchak, who are considered leading proponents of
reform, called on ``all political parties, both those supporting
the October revolution and those categorically opposed to it _ to
restrain themselves from any political acts'' on Nov. 6, 7 and 8
this year.
   The mayors said that whether Nov. 7 remains a national holiday
will be decided by a new treaty defining the relationship between
the 15 Soviet republics and the central government.
   But for this year at least, they said they would prefer to skip
the merrymaking and ``remember 1941, when the holiday was
transformed into saying goodbye to troops leaving Red Square to go
into battle.''

   The White House on Monday said Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein was ``grasping at any straw he can find'' in mending
relations with Iran, once a bitter enemy, and offering free oil to
Third World nations.
   ``The man is desperate, reaching out wherever he can,'' White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   As his spokesman belittled Saddam, President Bush worked on the
speech he will deliver Tuesday night before a joint session of
Congress on the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``He's going to be very candid with them about exactly what
we're doing there and why and what our purposes are,'' Fitzwater
said. He said there would be no surprises or new initiatives.
   The president also will use the gulf crisis to prod Congress to
reach a budget agreement, Fitzwater said.
   Bush, meanwhile, asked Congress for $14.2 million so that the
government-financed Voice of America can broadcast its radio
programs 24 hours a day in the Persian Gulf and throughout the
Middle East.
   Currently, VOA broadcasts only 7{ hours a day. To pay for
increasing the Arabic service, Bush proposed cutbacks in radio
programs beamed to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   Also on Monday, Bush called the leaders of France, Egypt,
Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Canada to brief them on his weekend summit
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Bush and Gorbachev said
they were prepared to take additional steps against Iraq if the
sanctions fail to force Baghdad to withdraw from Kuwait.
   Reporting on Bush's conversations, Fitzwater said, ``The
response has been overwhelmingly supportive and almost euphoric in
many cases in terms of the Soviet Union and the United States being
able to come together this way.
   ``It's a very important source of strength for many countries
around the world who have had ties in both countries or had
relationships one way or another to have this happen,'' he said,
referring to the summit accord.
   Iraq, meanwhile, sought to break the trade embargo imposed on it
by the U.N. by offering free oil supplies to Third World nations.
In another development, Iran agreed to restore diplomatic relations
with Iraq, its bitter enemy in a bloody eight-year war.
   Fitzwater predicted Iraq would not benefit much from improved
relations with Iran. ``They've been enemies for so long. It's hard
to believe Iran's going to be too supportive in this effort.''
   ``It shows Saddam Hussein is reaching out to a country where he
murdered millions of their people,'' Fitzwater added. ``So, he's
grasping at any straw he can find.''
   He noted that Iran has said it will abide by the U.N. sanctions,
and will be expected to honor that commitment.
   As for Saddam's offer of free oil for developing countries,
Fitzwater said, ``It means nothing. The sanctions clearly cover the
oil _ at any cost.''
   In a written statement, Fitzwater said, ``Saddam Hussein's
latest statement is a transparent attempt to deflect the focus of
world attention from his blatant aggression against another
country. Such maneuvers have not worked in the past and will not
work this time.''
   ``It is an affront to all countries for Saddam to think that
they would sacrifice the principles of freedom and non-aggression
for the Iraqi oil or the oil that he has taken through his naked
aggression,'' the statement said.

   Americans took out a seasonally adjusted $4.47
billion more in consumer credit than they paid off in July, the
biggest increase in debt in eight months, the government said
Monday.
   The Federal Reserve said consumer credit rose 7.4 percent at an
annual rate following a revised 0.2 percent gain, or $116 million,
in June. The central bank originally had reported the June increase
at 0.8 percent.
   The July advance was the largest since a 7.8 percent jump in
November and approximated the $4.42 billion monthly average of 1988
and 1989. The Fed said consumer credit growth slowed to an average
of $1.78 billion a month during the first seven months of 1990.
   ``There are two explanations'' for the sharp increase, said Sung
Won Sohn, chief economist for Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. ``One
is that it simply is a statistical aberration'' and will decline in
coming months to $1 billion to $2 billion a month.
   ``The other, more important possibility is that consumers are
getting pinched right now,'' he added. ``Prices were going up in
general even before the oil crisis. Wages were not keeping up with
prices, so consumers were relying more and more on revolving
credit.''
   Nearly 75 percent of the July gain was in revolving, or credit
card, debt. It was up 21.7 percent at a annual rate, or $3.77
billion, after rising 7.0 percent in June. Such debt had increased
18.8 percent in May.
   The sluggish automobile sector, on the other hand, declined 2.2
percent, or $534 million, on top of a 7.3 percent drop a month
earlier. It was unchanged in May.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose 7.0
percent, or $1.20 billion, after gains of 4.4 percent in June and
2.1 percent in May.
   Borrowing for mobile homes edged up 1.7 percent, or $33 million,
after falling 4.3 percent in June. It had risen 6.0 percent in May.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of July
at $729.1 billion.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said Monday he would go to Syria to coordinate anti-Iraq efforts
with President Hafez Assad, despite major differences that include
U.S. listing of Syria as a sponsor of international terrorism.
   ``We share the same goals,'' Baker said, referring to the U.S.
drive to isolate Iraqi President Saddam Hussein with a strict
economic boycott and to confront him with an international ground
and sea force.
   However, the United States considers Assad one of the more
radical Arab leaders in the Middle East, and Baker acknowledged,
``We continue to have some differences with Syria and we expect to
discuss those differences.''
   In a news conference at NATO headquarters, Baker also reported
that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the overthrown
government of Kuwait would contribute $12 billion to help pay for
the U.S. defense of the Persian Gulf and to assist nations hurt
financially by their adherence to the boycott of Iraq authorized
last month by the U.N. Security Council.
   Barring unforeseen expenses, the contributions would cover the
estimated $6 billion the United States planned to spend in
defending Saudi oil fields this year.
   Baker said President Bush had directed him to go to Damascus to
meet with Assad Thursday night after talks in Moscow with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze.
   ``The president felt it was an important time to have a
face-to-face dialogue,'' Baker said.
   He then flew to Moscow where he will pursue with the Soviets a
new approach to limiting non-nuclear troops, tanks and artillery in
Europe.
   The two superpowers had agreed in February in Ottawa to limit
U.S. and Soviet troops in Central Europe to 195,000. An additional
30,000 U.S. troops could be stationed elsewhere in Western Europe.
   But the planned withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe
has caused a reappraisal. Baker said the Ottawa goals had been
``overtaken by events'' and ``no longer pertain.''
   Besides considering lower levels, which would mean a withdrawal
of even more U.S. troops, Baker will meet with Shevardnadze and the
foreign ministers of Britain, France, West Germany and East Germny
on the emerging unification of the two Germanys.
   Syria, in a makeshift alliance with the United States, has sent
troops to Saudi Arabia and to the United Arab Emirates to guard
their oil fields against an Iraqi attack.
   Over the years, the State Department has sharply condemned
Syria's domestic human rights record and accused it of sponsoring
terrorism against American and Israeli civilians.
   Syria is one of the seven countries on the department's
terrorism list, making it ineligible for U.S. military equipment,
sophisticated technology and U.S. assistance in acquiring
international bank loans. After an eight-year lapse Iraq was put
back on the list Sept. 1.
   Baker said he spoke by telephone with the ambassadors of Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates Monday morning and received
word that they, along with the overthrown Kuwait monarchy, will
contribute a total of $12 billion to the economic and military
campaign against Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   While touring the Persian Gulf last week, Baker received
commitments of aid _ without specific amounts _ from King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia and President Zayid of the United Arab Emirates. Emir
Jabir al Sabah of the displaced Kuwaiti government offered $6
billion.
   Baker said roughly half of the $12 billion would go to offset
costs of American efforts in the gulf, including U.S. forces. The
other half would assist poorer nations observing the boycott of
Iraq.
   After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, the Bush
administration reached out to both Syria and Iran to join the
campaign against Saddam, relying on their longstanding differences
with Baghdad.
   Assad and Saddam head rival factions of the Baathist party while
Iran fought an eight-year war with Iraq.
   As Baker briefed NATO foreign ministers on the summit Bush and
Gorbachev held Sunday in Helsinki, Finland, the Iranian news agency
reported Iran has agreed to restore diplomatic relations with Iraq.
   A U.S. official said Baker had no plans to meet with Iranian
representatives, while Baker said he would not go to Tehran.
   ``The United States has not had good relations with Syria,''
Baker said. ``We would like to see an improvement in those
relations.''
   Pressed why he was going to Damascus, Baker replied: ``They are
there.''
   He made no mention of Iraq's reported diplomatic reconciliation
with Iran When asked if the United States would welcome Iranian
help, Baker said: ``You bet we would.''
   The United States has no relations with Iran while maintaining
ties with Syria.
   As for NATO participation in the anti-Iraq effort, of the 16
nations in the alliance only the United States, Turkey, Britain and
France have troops in the Persian Gulf region.
   Others have contributed ships to move troops, and eight
countries are holding exercises in the Mediterranean.
   Baker said he suggested they extend their operations eastward _
closer to the crisis area.
   Manfred Woerner, the NATO secretary-general, said, ``There was a
unanimous conviction more can and should be done'' by the allies to
support the United States. But Woerner stressed it would be up to
each nation to decide what to do.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronological look at key events in the 11-year-old
Cambodian civil war:
   _On Christmas Day 1978, Vietnamese tanks roll in to start
Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and war with its former Communist
ally, the Khmer Rouge.
   _On Jan. 7, 1979, the Vietnamese march into the Cambodian
capital, Phnom Penh. The strike is so swift the Khmer Rouge leaves
behind half-eaten meals and tons of arms as they flee.
   
   _On Jan. 10, 1979, a new Communist government is proclaimed. It
is led by Heng Samrin and other Khmer Rouge defectors who had fled
to Vietnam, fearing the previous government's bloody purges. But
sanctuary from Thailand and arms from China soon raise the Khmer
Rouge into a potent guerrilla insurgency.
   _In January-February 1979, China wages a border war against
Vietnam to ``punish'' it for the invasion of Cambodia.
   
   _In June 1982, the Khmer Rouge, the forces of Prince Norodom
Sihanouk and those of former Premier Son Sann form a resistance
coalition. The United Nations recognizes it as Cambodia's
government. _In March 1985, Vietnamese forces, allied to the
government in Phnom Penh, overrun every major border camp in their
greatest victory of the war.
   _In July 1987, Sihanouk holds peace talks in France with Phnom
Penh's Prime Minister Hun Sen.
   
   _On Dec. 19, 1988, Premier Li Peng says China will decrease its
aid to the resistance as Vietnam withdraws from Cambodia. He says
China will halt all aid when the troops are gone.
   
   _In December 1988, Vietnam begins its pullout of an estimated
50,000 troops.
   _In January 1989, Vietnam sends a senior official to Beijing to
discuss the conflict. The two sides agree that Vietnam will
withdraw its troops by September in exchange for an end to Chinese
aid to the guerrillas.
   _In July 1989, a 19-nation conference on Cambodia opens in
Paris. Sihanouk calls for an interim government with Khmer Rouge
participation. Hun Sen opposes the idea.
   _In September 1989, Vietnam says it has withdrawn its last
troops. Guerrillas call it a sham and begin a general offensive.
China calls the pullout a fraud and indicates it will continue
arming the guerrillas until there is a political settlement.
   _On Sept. 30, 1989, non-communist guerrillas seize the district
seat of Thmar Puok near the Thai border. They make their greatest
gains in the war in the coming months.
   _On Feb. 11-13, 1990, the U.N. Security Council's permanent
members say regrouping the Cambodian armies into designated areas
is essential to the peace process. But they fail to agree on
proposals to disarm the factions. Sihanouk and Hun Sen hold talks
in Bangkok, Thailand. They agree on the need for a U.N. presence in
Cambodia and a ``supreme national body'' to government the country.
   _In April, Sihanouk urges an immediate cease-fire. He says the
U.N. Security Council should deploy peacekeeping troops to enforce
it.
   _In June, Cambodian guerrillas launch major attacks and seize
areas of several provinces as Cambodia's warring factions prepare
to meet to discuss a cease-fire. Chinese, Thai and U.S. officials
join attempts to foster progress in peace talks stalled by the
Khmer Rouge's refusal to attend.
   _In July, U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker announces that
Washington is withdrawing diplomatic recognition of the resistance
coalition because it includes the Khmer Rouge.
   _On Sept. 5, Baker announces the United States will open direct
talks for the first time with Hun Sen's government. The first talks
are held the next day.
   _On Sept. 10, warring parties agree to a U.N. peace plan to end
the 11-year-old war. They agree to share power on an interim
Supreme National Council until elections can be held. A cease-fire
remains to be worked out.

   Americans took out a seasonally adjusted $4.47
billion more in consumer credit than they paid off in July, the
biggest increase in debt in eight months, the government said
Monday.
   The Federal Reserve said consumer credit rose 7.4 percent at an
annual rate following a revised 0.2 percent gain, or $116 million,
in June. The central bank originally had reported the June increase
at 0.8 percent.
   The July advance was the largest since a 7.8 percent jump in
November and approximated the $4.42 billion monthly average of 1988
and 1989. The Fed said consumer credit growth slowed to an average
of $1.78 billion a month during the first seven months of 1990.
   ``There are two explanations'' for the sharp increase, said Sung
Won Sohn, chief economist for Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. ``One
is that it simply is a statistical aberration'' and will decline in
coming months to $1 billion to $2 billion a month.
   ``The other, more important possibility is that consumers are
getting pinched right now,'' he added. ``Prices were going up in
general even before the oil crisis. Wages were not keeping up with
prices, so consumers were relying more and more on revolving
credit.''
   Nearly 75 percent of the July gain was in revolving, or credit
card, debt. It was up 21.7 percent at a annual rate, or $3.77
billion, after rising 7.0 percent in June. Such debt had increased
18.8 percent in May.
   The sluggish automobile sector, on the other hand, declined 2.2
percent, or $534 million, on top of a 7.3 percent drop a month
earlier. It was unchanged in May.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose 7.0
percent, or $1.20 billion, after gains of 4.4 percent in June and
2.1 percent in May.
   Borrowing for mobile homes edged up 1.7 percent, or $33 million,
after falling 4.3 percent in June. It had risen 6.0 percent in May.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of July
at $729.1 billion.

<HEAD>Peace Accord Reached in Cambodian Struggle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cambodia's Vietnamese-backed
government and leaders of rebel factions agreed Monday to a U.N.
peace plan that calls for power-sharing and free elections.
   Cambodia Premier Hun Sen said a date for a cease-fire had not
been worked out, but all sides appeared optimistic following two
days of talks to end the 11-year-old civil war.
   ``We have not reached peace yet ... but we have the framework,''
said Son Sann, former Cambodian premier and leader of the Khmer
People's National Liberation Front, part of the three-party
guerrilla force.
   Efforts to reach a peace accord since July 1988 had failed when
the factions disagreed about power-sharing issues. Under the
approved U.N. plan, each of the four factions would be represented
in a governing council.
   A joint statement said Hun Sen's government would get six seats
on the so-called Supreme National Council. Six others seats would
be shared by the resistance coalition. A 13th seat is reserved for
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of the rebel coalition.
   The council is expected to make its first formal appearance
Sept. 18 at the U.N. General Assembly seat now held by the rebel
coalition.
   The council would cede much of its authority to the United
Nations, which would administer the country until free elections.
U.N. officials have said up to 10,000 troops and 10,000 civilian
personnel could be sent to Cambodia to administer the peace plan
and oversee elections.
   The plan, which also calls for disarming the four armies, was
adopted last month by the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council: the United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain
and France.
   ``We are very pleased with the document ... and we accept it
without reservation,'' said Khieu Samphan, head of the Communist
Khmer Rouge, which rejected the plan in June because each faction
did not have an equal number of seats on the council.
   ``If I can summarize it in one word _ success,'' said Edwige
Avice, French deputy foreign minister, who led the peace talk
effort along with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.
   The rebel coalition includes the non-Communist forces of
Sihanouk and Son Sann, who are backed by Washington, and the
Chinese-backed Communist Khmer Rouge.
   The rebels have been battling to oust the Vietnamese-backed
Phnom Penh government, which seized power in late 1978 after its
forces toppled the Khmer Rouge.
   During nearly four years in power, the Khmer Rouge tried to
transform Cambodia into a radical agrarian society, resulting in
the deaths of nearly 1 million people.
   In a statement issued in Beijing on Monday, Sihanouk said he
would take a six-month leave from politics because of ill health.
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Sihanouk's son and leader of his faction
in Jakarta, said his father suffered from kidney stones.
   The five Security Council nations said they ``would welcome''
Sihanouk as head of the council, but the factions will be able to
decide its makeup and the arrangements to transfer power to the U.N.
   In a message from Beijing on Saturday, Sihanouk quoted Chinese
Prime Minister Li Peng as saying ``the time is ripe to solve the
Cambodian problem.''
   The peace talk process sped up after the United States withdrew
diplomatic recognition of the rebel coalition because it included
the Khmer Rouge.
   On Sept. 6, the Bush administration opened its first talks with
Hun Sen's government.

   Iraq's Foreign Ministry has informed U.S.
officials that the remains of James L. Worthington, who died of a
heart attack last month while in Iraqi custody, soon will be
returned to the United States, the State Department said Monday.
   Worthington had been working as a bank consultant in Kuwait at
the time of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Family members reported
that Iraqi authorities took him hostage in Kuwait and transferred
him to the Iraqi port city of Basra where he suffered a heart
attack and died.
   A State Department spokesman said U.S. officials have been
informed that a clearance had been issued for the release of
Worthington's remains. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad has been
pressing for the repatriation of his remains since his death was
confirmed late last month.
   Worthington, 53, was a native of Marathon, Tex. When not
overseas, he lived with his family in Woodstock, N.Y.
   The spokesman, asking not to be identified, also said that Iraqi
authorities still have not granted U.S. consular officials
permission to visit an unidentified American who was shot last week
by an Iraqi soldier. The incident took place while the American was
trying to escape out of a window of his apartment in Kuwait.
   U.S. officials complained about the lack of consular access with
Iraqi officials in Baghdad over the weekend. A complaint also was
lodged on Monday with Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed al-Mashat.

<HEAD>Poll Shows Incumbent Levin Leading Schuette in Michigan Senate
Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Carl Levin is leading his Republican
challenger, Rep. Bill Schuette, by a 63 percent to 26 percent
margin, according to a poll published Monday.
   ``Things can change in a minute, but this is very encouraging,''
said Gordon Kerr, Levin's campaign manager.
   But Douglas McAuliffe, Schuette's campaign manager, said the gap
will shrink as Schuette's advertising increases and voters focus
more on the Nov. 6 general election. ``We have a lot of work to
do,'' McAuliffe said.
   The Detroit News survey of 800 registered voters, conducted
Tuesday to Thursday by Gannett Corporate Research Department, had a
margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.
   The survey showed Levin leading in every region of the state. In
Levin's hometown of Detroit, the senator was favored by 88 percent
of those surveyed, compared to 3 percent for Schuette. Elsewhere,
the poll showed, Levin had 57 percent of voter support, to 31
percent for Schuette.
   About 49 percent of those surveyed said they were unfamiliar
with Schuette, a four-term congressman.

<HEAD>Report Says Deceased Among the Registered Voters in East St. Louis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chronic financial problems have kept
this Mississippi River city from updating voter rolls, leaving
hundreds of dead and untraceable people registered for the Nov. 6
election, according to a published report.
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said in a copyright story that at
least 270 dead people and at least 113 people with addresses in
vacant lots or abandoned buildings are registered to vote in
November.
   Two people who died out of state didn't start voting until after
their deaths. Another man has voted six times since he died in
1987, the paper said.
   The newspaper's Sunday report said East St. Louis has not purged
its rolls since 1987 despite a state law requiring such action
every two years.
   But a state official is promising to have the registration list
purged by Election Day.
   ``The reason one wasn't done in 1989 was because of the
financial situation,'' said James Lewis, executive director of the
city election board. ``The aim was that we would do it sometime in
1990, which we haven't done.''
   East St. Louis has an estimated debt of $47 million and has had
trouble paying its employees and keeping up city services.
   The city purges its rolls of voters who die in St. Clair County,
but people who die out of state often remain on the voting rolls
for years, the newspaper found.
   Ronald Michaelson, executive director of the Illinois State
Board of Elections, called the situation ``intolerable.''
   ``We're going to view this with the utmost of concern,'' he
said. ``Whether we undertake this or have someone else, we're going
to have a cleansing of the rolls'' by Nov. 6.

<HEAD>Quayle's Campaign Stop A Thrill For Bystander _ But Not The

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle's unscheduled
campaign stop Monday at a fast-food restaurant was a thrill for
Kearney's Mary Weddle _ but not her biggest.
   Quayle, en route to a fund-raising luncheon for GOP Gov. Kay
Orr, wolfed down fast food as he and Mrs. Orr chatted with the
41-year-old Mrs. Weddle.
   ``This was the most exciting thing that ever happened to me,
almost,'' said Mrs. Weddle.
   Asked what could have been more exciting, she replied, ``I had
two daughters.''
   The stop at the McDonald's restaurant came moments after Quayle
had addressed nearly 2,000 students at Kearney High School, asking
them to join him in the war against drugs and claiming that America
will excel in education before the turn of the century.
   It was Quayle's second trip to Nebraska in five months to help
campaign for Mrs. Orr, the nation's first Republican woman elected
governor. Polls show her trailing Democratic nominee Ben Nelson.

<HEAD>Iran Restores Full Relations with Former Enemy Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONA ZIADE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Iran said Monday it has agreed to restore
full diplomatic relations with its former adversary Iraq, which is
hoping to break out of its international isolation and coax support
from other countries.
   But it was not clear whether Tehran, by reopening embassies and
exchanging diplomats with Baghdad for the first time since the
Iran-Iraq war, has agreed to allow Iraq to ship in food and
medicine through Iran to bypass U.N.-imposed economic sanctions for
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Middle East analyst Hans-Heino Kopietz noted diplomatic
relations between Iran and Iraq never officially were severed
despite the two countries' bloody 1980-88 war. They closed their
embassies in 1986 and their diplomats returned home, but there was
no formal declaration breaking relations.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, reported
the agreement was reached during talks in Tehran between Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and his Iraqi counterpart,
Tariq Aziz.
   Aziz returned to Baghdad on Monday after a 24-hour visit to
Tehran, the first by an Iraqi official since the Islamic
revolutionary government seized power in Iran in 1979.
   Quoting a reliable source, IRNA said that ``Aziz, in his talks
with Ali Akbar Velayati, called for the restoration of bilateral
relations and reopening of embassies in the two countries.
   ``Officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran gave a positive
response to the Iraqi foreign minister's call and announced their
consent in this connection,'' IRNA said.
   There was no immediate comment from Baghdad.
   Kopietz, a former specialist with London's International
Institute for Strategic Studies who is now a consultant, said it
was too early to say if Iran, its relations with the West marred by
a decade-long hostility, would go as far as rescinding its
commitment to the U.N. embargo.
   ``What it means is simply that they agreed to revive the
diplomatic relations, possibly at ambassadorial level, to establish
a direct channel of communication'' that would speed up a formal
border demarcation,'' Kopietz said in a telephone interview.
   IRNA said preparations for reactivating the diplomatic missions
will begin ``in the near future,'' but gave no other details.
   Aziz flew home Monday after a meeting with Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, which also was attended by Velayati, IRNA
reported.
   He had met alone with Valayati for 2{ hours immediately after
his arrival Sunday in Iran.
   IRNA quoted Aziz as saying before his departure that his talks
in Tehran were ``positive, serious, practical and friendly.''
   It said Aziz called for speeding up the ``the trend of
improvement of ties between Iran and Iraq and an exchange of
diplomatic delegations.''
   He said Iran and Iraq should join in confronting ``imperialist
trends to sow discord among the people of the region,'' adding that
he has invited Velayati to Baghdad and hoped to see him there soon.
   IRNA reported too that Aziz explained Baghdad's position in the
gulf to Rafsanjani and Velayati, who reiterated Iranian
condemnation of the annexation of Kuwait as well as the deployment
of foreign forces in the region.
   Aziz had been expected to ask Iraq to allow shipments of food
and medicine across their 730-mile border. The Tehran Times, an
English-language daily said to be close to Rafsanjani, hinted two
days ago that Iran might allow ``humanitarian shipments'' into its
onetime archenemy.
   Iran has declared it will abide by the U.N. sanctions. But it
has strongly condemned the U.S. presence in the region and there
was speculation that by hinting at aiding Iraq was aimed at
securing financial aid from the West.
   There were unconfirmed reports from Baghdad that the Iranians
already have allowed rice, flour and wheat consignments across the
northern border.
   ``The aid in food and medicines that Iran could provide could be
of crucial important at this stage,'' said a diplomat in Tehran,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Under the sanctions, Iraq's vital oil exports have been blocked,
cutting off its main source of revenue.
   The Tehran Times hinted that Iran could decide to allow Iraqi
oil out through its pipelines to its big Kharg Island terminal in
the northern Gulf.
   Analyst Charles Snow commented in the respected Middle East
Economic Survey newsletter Monday that such a move ``would be a
massive and flagrant violation of sanctions and the question is
what the Iranians hope to gain by even suggesting such a scenario.''
   Iraq has been desperately seeking that kind of support to help
it circumvent the sanctions, because its tiny coastline is
effectively blocked by the U.S.-led multinational fleet in the gulf.
   Baghdad's campaign to improve relations with Tehran began
shortly after imposition of the U.N. sanctions, when Iraq found
itself confrontating the West while its eastern border with Iran
remained highly vulnerable.
   President Saddam Hussein agreed to withdraw his troops from
Iranian territory held since the 1988 cease-fire, exchange all
prisoners-of-war and abide by a 1975 treaty splitting the vital
Shatt al-Arab waterway with Iran.
   The waterway, just north of the Kuwaiti border, is Iraq's key
outlet to the gulf.
   The withdrawal from Iranian territory freed tens of thousands of
soldiers for deployment in Kuwait, where Saddam's troops face more
than 100,000 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.

   More than 500 pieces of evidence are
being examined in the killings of five college students, but
investigators refused to say Monday if they are closer to an arrest.
   ``We're not going to let time dictate this investigation,'' said
Lt. Spencer Mann, spokesman for the Alachua County Sheriff's
Office. ``We have to be right. We can't guess. We can't take
chances.''
   Only about half the evidence, which authorities last week
characterized as ``promising,'' have been processed at the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement's Jacksonville crime lab, said Steve
Platt, who heads the lab.
   The evidence was gathered from the three slaying scenes, as well
as during searches of suspect Edward Lewis Humphrey's Gainesville
apartment, Indialantic home and his car, authorities said. The
evidence also includes bodily fluids and fingerprints taken from
Humphrey at the Brevard County Jail in Sharpes.
   He is being held in lieu of $1.1 million bond on unrelated
assault charges.
   ``It's a slow, painstaking effort,'' Platt said of the crime
scene evidence. ``We are faced with what can be likened to three
very complex puzzles that we are trying to put together one piece
at a time.''
   He said he could not give a timetable for completing the
examination.
   DNA testing of blood and semen are in progress, Platt said,
although investigators refused to say whether that evidence was
obtained from the scene or from Humphrey.
   Police refused to comment on published reports that a pubic hair
resembling Humphrey's was found at one of the slaying scenes, or
that he had told investigators where to find a knife hidden in a
milk carton.
   Investigators have described the killer as shrewd and
methodical. They have said he left taunting ``messages'' to them
and arranged body parts at the slaying scene for maximum shock
value.
   Humphrey is one of eight slaying suspects, police said. The only
other publicly identified is Stephen Michael Bates, 30, a Lakeland
short-order cook, also jailed on an unrelated assault charge.
   Humphrey faces one count of assaulting his grandmother, and is
charged with the October 1988 armed burglary and attempted rape of
an Indian River County woman, and an Aug. 25 assault on two male
University of Florida students.
   Meanwhile, life around this college town appeared to carry on
normally, with landlords making plans to rent the apartments where
students were slain. Investigators finished their searches of the
apartments over the weekend.
   ``There's still blood on the walls,'' said Carol Hyde, manager
of the Gatorwood Apartments, where the bodies of Manny Taboada and
Tracy Paules, both 23, were found Aug. 28.
   The other victims were Christina Powell, 17, Sonya Larson, and
Christa Hoyt, both 18.

   An earthquake shook the Pacific resort

   The 9:45 a.m. (11:45 a.m. EDT) quake registered 4.9 on the
Richter scale, the National University of Mexico's Tacubaya
seismological station in Mexico City reported. It placed the center
of the quake just east of Acapulco, a popular beach resort with
about 500,000 yearround residents.
   Some tourists were stranded briefly in elevators that stopped
when the electricity went off, the Excelsior news service said, and
some schoolchildren also panicked for a few moments during the
tremor, the report said.

   Saddam Hussein offered free oil to developing nations Monday in
a bid to win their support and circumvent a U.N. trade embargo, and
he got a boost from a former enemy when Iran agreed to restore full
diplomatic ties.
   The White House characterized both developments as signs the
Iraqi president is growing desperate and ``grasping at any straw he
can find.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, briefing NATO ministers
on the weekend U.S.-Soviet summit, asked the allies to send ground
troops into the Persian Gulf region _ even as a symbolic presence _
to increase pressure on Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. There were no
immediate offers.
   Baker also announced he would visit Syria to coordinate
opposition to Iraq with President Hafez Assad. The United States
and Syria have longstanding differences over human rights and
terrorism but have formed a makeshift alliance during the gulf
crisis.
   Syria beefed up its contribution to the multinational force
facing Iraq, saying it was sending more troops to Saudi Arabia at
the desert kingdom's request. Diplomatic sources estimate that
Syria has already sent 4-5,000 combat troops to the kingdom.
   In other developments Monday:
   _Baker told reporters Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
the exiled government of Kuwait would contribute a combined $12
billion to help defray the cost of the U.S. buildup in the gulf and
to assist poorer nations hurt by the U.N. trade embargo on Iraqi
goods.
   _The official Iraqi News Agency criticized President Bush's
motives in meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
Helsinki, Finland. It said the summit showed Bush's ``evil
tendencies and his spite for the Arab nation.''
   After seven hours of talks Sunday, the two leaders reiterated
their demand that Iraq withdraw immediately and unconditionally
from Kuwait. They did not rule out the use of force if a peaceful
solution is not found.
   _There were reports Saddam has executed members of his elite
Presidential Guard who allegedly were planning to assasinate him.
Two Egyptian state newspapers, quoting Western diplomats, said five
officers were ordered executed. Kuwait Radio, run by the emirate's
government-in-exile, reported Sunday that three members of the
guard already had been killed. It gave no details.
   _Kuwait's ambassador to the United Nations said Iraqi occupation
forces have intensified their crackdown on Kuwaitis, killing
civilians in the streets and rounding up others in mass arrests.
   In his latest televised message, Saddam addressed Third World
countries but did not name them. He said he was making his offer as
a gesture of solidarity, regardless of the various governments'
stands in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``We hereby declare that we are prepared to supply all Third
World countries with oil free of charge in accordance with the
needs of each country,'' Saddam said.
   ``We are brothers to you. We share the same destiny,'' he told
the developing nations in what appeared a clear attempt to gain
their support in his faceoff against the West.
   The offer is ``in appreciation for your evenhanded policies
toward Arab causes, the foremost of which is the Palestinian
cause,'' Saddam said.
   His statement was read by a broadcaster on Iraqi state radio and
TV and monitored and translated in Nicosia, Cyprus by The
Associated Press.
   Saddam said Iraq could not transport the oil because of the U.N.
embargo, so interested countries would have to arrange transport
themselves. That would require tankers to dock in Iraq and load the
oil in violation of the embargo.
   Saddam claimed his offer would not violate the U.N. sanctions
because no buying or selling would be involved. The embargo was
imposed shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater disagreed with Saddam's
claim picking up free oil would not violate the embargo. ``The
sanctions clearly cover the oil _ at any cost,'' he said in a
written statement.
   The United Nations has approved the use of force to enforce the
anti-Iraqi sanctions.
   Scores of developing nations have suffered as a result of the
prohibition on trade with Iraq. Among those hit hard have been
Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
   In Tehran, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
that Iran and Iraq had agreed to restore full diplomatic ties and
open embassies in the two countries.
   It said the agreement was reached in a meeting between Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and his Iraqi counterpart,
Tariq Aziz.
   Aziz left Tehran Monday after a 24-hour visit in which he sought
Iranian help in beating the U.N. trade sanctions. It was not clear
whether Tehran had agreed to allow Iraq to receive food and
medicine through Iran, but there were unconfirmed reports that
shipments of rice and flour already were being sent to Iraq via
Iran.
   Iran's leaders have said they will honor the embargo, although
they object to the U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia.
   IRNA, quoting what it called a reliable source, said that
``Aziz, in his talks with Ali Akbar Velayati, called for the
restoration of bilateral relations and reopening of embassies in
the two countries.
   ``Officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran gave a positive
response to the Iraqi foreign minister's call and announced their
consent,'' IRNA said in an English-language dispatch.
   It quoted the source as saying the exchange of diplomatic
missions will begin ``in the near future,'' but gave no other
details.
   Diplomatic relations between Iran and Iraq were never officially
severed even though the two countries were at war from 1980 to
1988. They closed their embassies in 1986 and their diplomats
returned home.
   Aziz's visit to Iran was the first by an Iraqi official since
the Islamic revolution in 1979. A year later, the Persian Gulf war
broke out. An August 1988 cease-fire halted fighting.
   Baghdad began its campaign to improve relations with Tehran
shortly after the U.N. sanctions were ordered. It withdrew its
troops from Iranian territory it had held since the cease-fire,
began prisoner exchanges, and agreed to abide by a 1975 treaty
splitting the Shatt al-Arab waterway with Iran. Previously, Iraq
had demanded full control of the waterway.
   In Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that
both Iraq's overtures to Iran and its offer of free oil were
``desperation attempts.''
   ``Such maneuvers have not worked in the past and will not work
this time,'' Fitzwater said.

   A balloon carrying a crew of three on a test
flight to study the ozone layer made an unscheduled landing in a
remote spot after the wind shifted, a spokeswoman for the
Earthwinds project said Monday.
   The balloon was carrying an international crew that included the
Soviet Union's chief of cosmonaut training and the inventor of the
ultralight aircraft.
   The craft landed about 4 a.m. after the wind shifted, carrying
it north toward Canada instead of east toward Montana, said Lori
Levin of Virgin Atlantic Airways in New York, speaking for
Earthwinds.
   ``They were concerned that they were headed into the Canadian
Rockies,'' Levin said.
   She said the balloon landed on a mountain or mesa about 9 miles
south of Omak this north-central Washington town. No one was
injured.
   The crew called Levin from their cellular phone, but she
couldn't get back in touch with them.
   The helium balloon and gondola left Tillamook on Saturday night
after a four-day delay, during which scientists tinkered with the
craft and waited for winds to calm.
   The balloon, riding the jet stream at 25,000 feet, had been
expected to arrive in Wisconsin on Wednesday.
   Scientists said earlier that if the test flight were successful,
a larger version of the craft would lift off from Akron, Ohio, this
winter in the first attempt to circle the Earth by helium balloon.
The international mission would study atmospheric turbulence and
ozone levels.
   Aboard the balloon were:
   _ Larry Newman, inventor of the ultralight aircraft, the captain
and project leader. He is the only surviving member of crews that
traversed the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in helium balloons. In
1978, his Double Eagle II was the first helium balloon to cross the
Atlantic. He crossed the Pacific in another balloon three years
later.
   _ Gen. Vladimir Dzhanibekov, the pilot, is chief of cosmonaut
training in the Soviet Union. He has logged a total of 146 days in
space.

   President Bush asked Congress on Monday for
$14.2 million for around-the-clock radio broadcasts in the Persian
Gulf and Middle East by the government's Voice of America.
   The money would be more than offset by cutting $24 million from
the budget of the Board for International Broadcasting, which
provides the funding for broadcasts into Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union by Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty.
   Before Iraq invaded Kuwait, VOA broadcast 7{ hours a day in the

Arabic-language programs and 11 hours of English-language programs
each day.

<HEAD>Nader Demands Retraction for Forbes Magazine Article</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer activist Ralph Nader objected
strongly Monday to a Forbes magazine cover story depicting him as
overseer of a vast network of organizations financed in part by
rich lawyers and other special interest groups.
   ``It is really reckless stuff,'' Nader said in a telephone
interview. ``If they don't retract I will take them to court.''
   Forbes Editor James W. Michael said the article was carefully
researched and checked and ``we stand by it.''
   The Sept. 17 edition of the business biweekly said the
56-year-old Nader controlled to varying degrees 29 organizations
with combined revenues of $75 million to $80 million.
   It said Nader had an ``umbilical'' connection with rich
plaintiff attorneys who make huge sums in Nader-backed suits
against industry and in return contribute to his consumer
organizations.
   The article, titled ``St. Ralph And His Web of Interests'' and
written by Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer, said Nader has
consistently opposed changes in the damage-suit system.
   It also said Nader has shown little interest in health problems
related to smoking because of donations from tobacco fortunes, and
has said little about the cost to consumers of protectionism
because of his ties to organized labor.
   Forbes also said Nader's claims that he leads an austere life
were a myth. It said he rides in limousines and stays in the best
hotels when traveling, earns up to $1 million a year in speaking
fees and lives in a luxurious town house in Washington D.C.
   In reaction, Nader said he earns about $300,000 annually for
speaking engagements, and donates all but $15,000 to various
research groups and charities. He said the town house Forbes refers
to belongs to his sister.
   ``This is a really sleazy invasion of privacy,'' he said.
   Nader said he will go to court if Forbes does not retract
statements that his Center for Study of Responsive Law has not
filed disclosure forms obligatory for non-profit organizations
since its 1968 founding.
   He said the reason the Internal Revenue Service reported no
documents from the center was that Forbes gave the IRS the wrong
name, putting ``the'' in front of the title.
   Nader said he will also demand that Forbes retract statements
that he owns Citizens Television Systems, Inc., which he said is a
non-profit corporation. He said he found more than two dozen other
mistakes in the article, which he will take up in a rebuttal he
will ask Forbes to publish.
   Nader said his organizations had received less than 1 percent of
their funds from the legal profession over the past 30 years.
   He said Forbes had attacked him because the business magazine
``is ideologically affiliated with the corporations we're
fighting,'' particularly big insurance companies hit by Nader's
consumer campaigns.
   Forbes Editor Michaels said Nader was ``obviously very
thin-skinned.''
   He said the main purpose of the article was to show Nader's deep
connections with trial lawyers. ``Mr. Nader has successfully
fostered the view that he stands above special interests, and in
fact we have established that he doesn't stand above special
interests at all.''

   More rain fell Monday over already saturated Texas, and a heat
wave reached a record duration in the deep South.
   Showers and thunderstorms associated with an upper-level weather
disturbance extended over much of the eastern half of Texas during
the afternoon.
   It was a second day of rain for parts of Texas. Heavy rain fell
Sunday over the Hill Country, with up to 8 inches near Palmetto
Bend State Park, about 40 miles east of San Antonio.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended over Louisiana and the
central Gulf Coast region.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT
included 1.70 inches at Shreveport, La.
   Rain in Texas during the six hours up to 8 a.m. included 2.62
inches at Waco and 1.44 inches at Galveston.
   Parts of Alaska also had heavy rain, with a threat of flooding.
Chulitna Pass in the Alaska Mountain range reported 2.22 inches of
rain during the 24 hours up to 8 p.m. ADT Sunday. And 2.5 to 3.5
inches had fallen across the southern and western Talkeetna
Mountains and the Matanuska Basin since Saturday.
   Showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered from
southwestern Texas through Kansas to western Nebraska, and a few
showers and thunderstorms were over southern Michigan.
   Showers and thunderstorms also spread from Arkansas into the
southern Ohio Valley and the southern Appalachians, and a few
showers and thunderstorms passed over southern Florida.
   Warm weather continued across much of the West and temperatures
were already above 100 in the Southwest deserts at midday, with 108
at Palm Springs, Calif.
   Temperatures were generally in the upper 80s and lower 90s from
the southern and central Plains to the southern and middle Atlantic
Coast states. Birmingham, Ala., had already hit 95 by midday,
making it a record 33 days in a row of 90-degree heat for
Birmingham; on Sunday, the city hit 99.
   Overnight temperatures dipped into the 40s in North Dakota and
northern Minnesota, and the Rockies had lows in the 30s and 40s.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 31 at Gunnison, Colo.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Master Sgt. Samuel Kanyon Doe
seized power, his people hailed him as a hero redeeming them from
serfdom imposed by descendants of freed American slaves who founded
Liberia.
   He clung to power for 10 years the way he gained it: with brutal
killings of challengers that shocked the world and left many
Liberians ashamed to admit their nationality.
   ``He and his bank accounts have grown fat, literally, on the
blood and flesh of our people,'' said a Liberian university
professor.
   President Doe, 38, refused repeated demands that he resign and
leave the country, and U.S. State Department said he had died of
wounds suffered in a gun and grenade battle with rebels of a small
faction led by Prince Johnson, who used to fight in Doe's army.
   The rebels quarreled with Doe when he turned up unexpectedly at
the headquarters of a West African regional force Sunday in
Monrovia's port. The regional troops came to Liberia in the hopes
of restoring peace. Rebels claimed Doe had finally decided to flee
the country, wracked by war since Dec. 24.
   More than 60 people, most of them Doe's bodyguards, died in the
fighting that left Doe wounded in both legs. He reportedly died
Sunday in a rebel camp where Johnson was interrogating him about
millions of dollars that disappeared from state coffers.
   Witnesses said Doe's mutilated body was put on display,
according to the British Broadcasting Corp..
   Doe started his political career as a semiliterate career
soldier who sneered at education. He became a portly, dictatorial
despot proud of the masters degree in political science he was
awarded by the University of Liberia.
   ``They got all their Ph.D.s in their books, I got a Ph.D. in M16
(guns),'' he once said. Books is a Liberian pidgeon word for
education.
   But Doe's arrogance masked what sometimes seemed to be an
inferiority complex. When he was forced by mounting opposition to
announce he would not stand for reelection next year, Doe said he
wanted to devote time to his family and get a doctorate.
   In his private life, he was said to be fond of football and
adopted the style of an African potentate, having six children from
his two wives and at least five from his mistresses. His senior
wife left him after the coup.
   Doe once declared he wanted someone else to carry the burden of
leading the nation to end ``political harassment'' that included
about 36 coup attempts. His detractors say many were conjured up as
excuses to kill opponents.
   The most serious of the coup attempts, in 1985, was led by Doe's
former army chief of staff, Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa. He had returned
from exile in the United States to try to oust Doe after blatantly
rigged elections.
   Quiwonkpa got to the gates of Doe's Israeli-built fortified
mansion before his troops were stopped.
   Doe boasted he disemboweled Quiwonkpa, his friend from
childhood. What was left of the general was paraded down Monrovia's
Tubman Boulevard on the back of a jeep by soldiers who stripped
flesh from the body and ate it publicly.
   ``I saw it, hundreds of Liberians saw it. The stories of
cannibalism at the mansion are not fairy tales,'' said a Liberian
clerk.
   An orgy of killings followed as Doe repressed a rebellion. He
sent troops to Quiwonkpa's home county of Nimba. They murdered
thousands of civilians from the Gio and Mano tribes to which the
coup plotters belonged.
   Five years later, the Gio and Mano took their revenge, rallying
to the call of rebel leader Charles Taylor. His rebel army invaded
from neighboring Ivory Coast last December, and Doe sent troops who
again killed hundreds of civilians.
   ``He has doomed us with a legacy of tribal hatred that may never
end, as each side seeks to avenge the killings of the others,''
said a lawyer.
   Doe is a Krahn, a tribe making up 2 percent of Liberia's 2.3
million people. Krahns are despised by most of the other 13 ethnic
groups.
   As for Doe's foreign policy, many Liberians said it was dictated
by greed.
   Liberia became the first African country after Egypt to resume
diplomatic relations with Israel after the Camp David agreement.
Doe then visited Israel and returned with commitments for
cooperation, including training of his feared Special
Anti-Terrorist Unit. Many personal favors were included, critics
claim.
   At the same time, his government is accused of extorting
hundreds of thousands of dollars from Lebanese businessmen who
smuggle diamonds from Liberia, depriving the nation of desperately
needed revenue.
   Libya was the first country to recognize Doe after his coup.
Other African leaders shunned the master sergeant and denounced the
assassination of 68-year-old President William Tolbert in his bed
and the killings of 16 Tolbert aides. The aides were given a
kangaroo trial, fastened to stakes on Monrovia's Atlantic beach,
and shot by a drunken firing squad.
   Doe had said at one point that he had no regrets, though he had
to make some difficult decisions.
   ``It is especially difficult when it comes to signing death
warrants,'' he said in 1985. ``In my lonely moments at night, I
said to myself, `Why should these people be executed?''

<HEAD>Dissident Rebel Struggled Against Government, Rival Insurgent</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Liberia, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Yealu Johnson, the dissident
rebel leader whose forces are said to have killed Liberia's
president, has fought on two fronts: to overthrow the government
and to overshadow a rival insurgent.
   Johnson, 31, was one of the original group that invaded Liberia
from the Ivory Coast on Dec. 24, rebel sources and friends say.
Johnson took command when the first commander, Paul Harris, was
killed in an early firefight with government troops.
   Rebel leader Charles Taylor later eclipsed Johnson, cultivating
foreign journalists and some friendly African governments, the
sources said.
   Johnson finally broke with Taylor this year, perhaps over the
issue of who would lead the movement. Since then, the two groups
have been at odds.
   Taylor has accused Johnson's forces of killing an elite combat
unit of Taylor's men. ``If we find him, we will kill him. He
assassinated seven of our special forces,'' Taylor reportedly said.
   Taylor has been accused by some rebel supporters of having
rivals executed.
   Johnson, whose forces have been described by U.S. officials as
more disciplined than Taylor's and perhaps stronger, is entirely of
African descent. Taylor is of mixed Americo-Liberian, African
ancestry. Americo-Liberians are the descendants of American slaves
who founded Liberia in 1847.
   It was Johnson's forces who moved into Monrovia, the capital, in
early August and took control of the port. Taylor's men remained
stalled on the outskirts after seizing most of Liberia.
   Son of a hunter from the Gio tribe, Johnson was born in
Yorcomplay in eastern Nimba County. Rebels launched their attack by
invading Nimba from the Ivory Coast last year.
   Johnson grew up with an uncle in Monrovia, where he was
befriended by an American family attached to the U.S. Agency for
International Development. They helped him finish high school.
   He joined the army in 1981 and quickly became a lieutenant
assigned to intelligence. He also received some military training
from U.S. advisers.
   He was arrested during an unsuccessful 1985 coup led by Gen.
Thomas Quiwonkpa but escaped and rejoined other exiles in Ivory
Coast.
   There has been speculation in some regional magazines that the
United States prefers Johnson to Taylor. The U.S. State Department
says Libya supports Taylor.

   The Senate approved a resolution Monday
threatening a deterioration in U.S. relations with nations that
don't contribute enough to the effort against Saddam Hussein. Japan
and West Germany were among countries singled out by irate senators.
   The resolution, attached to a spending bill for the Postal
Service, Treasury Department and other government agencies,
directed President Bush to present Congress a detailed report on
the administration's cost-sharing efforts by Nov. 30.
   ``During his consultations with other international leaders,''
Bush ``should consider stressing ... that failure by any country to
actively contribute in the most appropriate manner for that country
could have a detrimental impact on its bilateral relationship with
the United States,'' the resolution said.
   Passed by voice vote in the first such congressional action
since Bush ordered U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia, the resolution
reflected lawmakers' sensitivity to complaints from voters that the
United States is shouldering too much of the burden in the war of
nerves with Iraq.
   With 100,000 U.S. servicemen and women now deployed in the
Persian Gulf, the Defense Department estimates that its Desert
Shield operation to deter further Iraqi aggression will cost about
$11.3 billion over the next year.
   The European Community voted last week to contribute $2 billion
of economic aid to Egypt, Turkey and other countries who have
contributed troops to the buildup.
   Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the exiled government
of Kuwait have pledged $12 billion to help pay for the U.S.
military buildup and to assist poor nations hurt by adherence to
the trade embargo against Iraq.
   However, Japan, which gets about half of its oil from the
Persian Gulf region, so far has pledged only $1 billion despite
pleas from Treasury Secretary Nicholas S. Brady for more.
   ``If combat arises, it will not be Japanese boys whose lives are
at risk, it will be American boys,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
``The contemptible tokenism of the actions of the Japanese
government to date merit nothing but the world's contempt and
American hostility.''
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., the primary author of the
resolution, said the United States, with a $170 billion budget
deficit, ``cannot play Uncle Sugar to the World.''
   ``This time the burden must be shared,'' he said. ``Germany can
send more ships to the Mediterranean to offset the many U.S. naval
vessels now in the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.
South Korea, which imports 25 percent of its oil from the Persian
Gulf, can send some troops.''
   Both Germany and Japan contend that their constitutions adopted
after losing World War II forbid them from sending troops to the
Persian Gulf.
   DeConcini also singled out Japan's delay of a week in sending
800 four-wheel-drive vehicles for use in the Saudi desert because
its merchant marine balked at sending a ship into the region.
   ``There does not seem to be this same hesitation, however, when
four-wheel-drive vehicles are sent to U.S. ports in this country,''
he said.
   Also as part of the bill, the Senate approved by voice vote an
amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., that would allow troops in
the Desert Shield operation to mail letters home at no charge.
   Helms, who was among the lawmakers who visited with troops in
the region over the past two weeks, said a repeated complaint was
being unable to find stamps.
   ``No one needs to be told that mail is the crucial link between
the fighting man or woman and his family and friends back home,''
he said. ``They did not have stamps, they could not get stamps and,
if by some chance stamps came their way, they were soon stuck
together by the humidity and the sweat.''
   A similar free mailing provision was introduced Monday in the
House by Rep. William Ford, D-Mich., chairman of the House Post
Office and Civil Service Committee.

<HEAD>Gorbachev's Compromise Economic Reform Plan Dismays Radicals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dismaying radical reformers, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov have agreed on a
compromise economic reform plan that tries to unite two
contradictory proposals, officials said Monday.
   Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin has likened any such
attempt to combine the radical reform that he favors with Ryzhkov's
conservative economic plan to ``mating a hedgehog and a snake.''
   One radical legislator called for a vote of no confidence in
Ryzhkov's government.
   Radicals at the session of the Supreme Soviet that opened Monday
had been expecting Gorbachev himself to present the sweeping
economic reform plan devised by his adviser, Stanislav Shatalin.
   But Shatalin was left shaking his finger with fury in the
parliament's lobby as he told Gorbachev confidante Alexander
Yakovlev the compromise was impossible.
   Ryzhkov said Monday evening he would explain the compromise to
the Supreme Soviet national legislature on Tuesday. Gorbachev backs
the plan, parliamentary chairman Anatoly Lukyanov told the Tass
news agency.
   A joint economic task force set up by Yeltsin and Gorbachev
favors a plan to fundamentally change the structure of the country.
It would transfer enormous authority from the national parliament
to the legislatures of the 15 Soviet republics, according to a
draft obtained by The Associated Press.
   The republics then would have the power to pursue their own
reforms, including a rapid transfer to a market economy and
legalization of private land ownership.
   But Ryzhkov's government refuses to accept ``what it considers a
`rebellion' by the republics,'' Tass said.
   Ryzhkov's original plan, which the Supreme Soviet last spring
returned to him to be reworked, called for continued central
planning with a slow transition to a partial market economy. It
also urged doubling and tripling many state-controlled prices,
which set off a wave of panic-buying.
   At Monday's Supreme Soviet session, Leningrad Mayor and
Parliament member Anatoly Sobchak, one of the leading radicals,
urged a no-confidence vote in Ryzhkov for his failure to produce a
viable reform program.
   ``We don't have the right to keep preserving the power of the
government that showed its inability to lead the country out of a
crisis,'' Sobchak said.
   There was no immediate decision on whether to take a
no-confidence vote. Radicals have tried this twice in the past
year; it went to a vote once _ in December _ and Ryzhkov won easily.
   ``Ryzhkov is going to try to unite the different concepts'' of
central planning and a market economy, said legislator Alexei
Yablokov. ``I am convinced that it is impossible.''
   Ryzhkov and his staff believe a swift transition to a market
economy would be ``like an overdose for an exhausted patient,''
Tass said.
   Opponents of a rapid economic transition say it would lead to
popular discontent by causing widespread unemployment and steep
price rises.
   Shatalin's plan calls for Gorbachev's central government to
accept two controversial claims by the republics: control of their
own natural resources, and the supremacy of their laws over
national ones.
   Although billed as an economic reform plan, it amounts to a new
political structure for the nation. If signed by Gorbachev and the
republics, it would amount to an agreement on the principles of a
new union treaty _ the basic unifying document of the Soviet Union.
   But Gorbachev's refusal to accept the entire Shatalin plan puts
his national government once again on a collision course with the
government of the Russian republic, headed by Yeltsin. The Russian
parliament is expected to approve the Shatalin plan, possibly this
week.
   Shatalin told reporters Monday he believed Gorbachev generally
supported his radical proposal, and he was surprised to hear
Ryzhkov would offer a compromise. He said he expected to meet with
Gorbachev later Monday to discuss the situation.
   Shatalin said the Ryzhkov plan contradicted his own and the two
could not be merged.
   Tass said the parliamentary session amounted to ``the end of the
preparatory stage of perestroika, which resulted in the
disintegration of the old political and economic system.''
   Shatalin's plan calls for creation of an economic union of the
15 republics of the Soviet Union, with each republic controlling
its own finances and natural resources, and each entitled to a
share of the national gold and hard currency reserves, according to
an early draft.
   The national government would retain control of defense,
economic forecasting, money supply, customs and environmental
protection. It would run national scientific research and space
programs, atomic energy, railroads and communications. It would
control only those prices the republics allowed it to regulate.
   The national government would have no power to tax. Instead,
republics would pay dues based on their share of national income,
the draft said.
   Under the existing central planning system, Moscow bureaucrats
now set prices and divvy up factory production among many
customers, throwing the market into disarray with factories short
of supplies.

   ``Look at this! Think how frightened she must
have been,'' Rita Lowe exclaimed, trying to imagine her Italian
immigrant mother's awe on entering the cavernous registry room on
Ellis Island in 1907.
   ``Can you imagine, coming from a small village?'' she commented.
   Mrs. Lowe, 67, of Long Beach, Calif., was among the 371 people
who took the first ferry from Battery Park on lower Manhattan
across the harbor Monday for the first day that the ``portal to the
New World'' was reopened to the public as a museum celebrating
American immigrants.
   ``We came to be sure we were here this first day,'' said Mrs.
Lowe, who walked the halls of the restored building with relatives,
remembering her mother's tales.
   ``Coming from a small town, women were modest and the physical
embarrassed her. I can understand but she couldn't. She often spoke
of those first days here and would say to me: `I was healthy, not
sick. Why did they have to examine me that way?' ''
   ``We have to keep this place alive,'' Mrs. Lowe said. ``In
memory of her and for all those reasons why she came here, her and
all the others.''
   Laima Silaikis Hood, 50, of New York, came to the United States
from Lithuania in 1949. She didn't enter through Ellis Island, but
an uncle of hers had in 1910.
   ``The significance for me, being an immigrant _ a refugee _ is
that I can identify with those who came before,'' she said,
standing before photo murals and a display of century-old
immigrants' trunks, valises and baskets in the Baggage Room, a
great hall at the front entrance of the museum.
   The building contains a variety of exhibits on three levels,
many depicting what the incoming millions and their adopted country
were like when they got here.
   Patricia Sandler was enthralled with the display of immigrant
artifacts and said she wished she had thought to contribute an
heirloom from her grandparents, John and Maria DeSimone. They
passed through Ellis Island from Naples, Italy, in 1907.
   ``They had lived near Mount Vesuvius, and when it erupted they
had copper pots they put over their heads to protect them from
falling stones.
   ``We've had those pots all these years, things they kept in
steamer trunks as mementos,'' Mrs. Sandler said.
   Theodore Heretakis, 55, went straight from the ferry to the
island's seawall to scan the Wall of Honor. Among the 200,000 names
inscribed in copper he found the name of his father, Stavros, and
his father-in-law, Pantelis Gigourtakis, who came from Crete in the
1920s.
   ``I marvel at the achievement of all the immigrants,'' said
Heretakis, an engineer who lives in Commack. ``They all demonstrate
what our parents had, the hard work and aspiration.''
   Jerry Khlumsky, 48, of New York, said his grandfather, Joseph,
settled in Chicago in the 1890s after arriving in New York from
Prague, in what is now Czechoslovakia.
   ``I feel very close and yet there's a gap,'' Khlumsky said. ``I
feel a kinship with eastern Europe and this is sort of a meeting
place between here and there.''
   ``I can't believe people had the guts to leave and come where
they had no idea what they were coming to,'' said Jennifer
Wechsler, 18, of Los Angeles, who took in the museum with her
mother Judy on the last day of a visit in the city.
   Barbara Viborka, 54, of New York, reminiscing at the seawall,
said her parents came from Czechoslovakia, arriving in separate
ships.
   ``Growing up I heard about the trip all the time,'' she said.
``They never told me about the bad. They made a joke of it.
   ``Mother was just coming for a visit to see a cousin and go back
home. She was 16. But she was seasick 14 days and she said she
decided when she got here, `God put me on land and that's where I'm
staying.' ''

<HEAD>Midwestern Universities, Black Colleges Form Alliance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen historically black colleges and
universities are affiliating in pairs with seven midwestern
research universities to improve the research capabilities of the
black institutions, the Education Department said Monday.
   The new coalition, known as the University Consortium for
Research and Development, was unveiled at a conference where Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins announced an ``academic partnership''
between his department and a Hazardous Materials and Waste
Management Consortium formed by the historically black colleges.
   The Midwest consortium will try to win more research grants and
contracts from private sources and federal agencies, particularly
the Defense Department. The Energy Department's partnership will
seek to increase the production of specialists in waste management,
officials said.
   The nation has 107 colleges and universities that traditionally
have attracted black students, sometimes in the past being reserved
for them by law when blacks were excluded from white institutions.
   Today those institutions serve more than 228,000 students. The
Education Department said the institutions have provided
undergraduate education for three-fourths of all blacks holding a
doctorate degree; three-fourths of all black officers in the armed
forces and four-fifths of all black federal judges.
   Xavier University President Norman Francis added, ``too often
our youngsters have not had the opportunity in undergraduate school
to do research and we are very concerned about increasing the
number of our graduates in graduate school so they will become the
researchers of the future, as well as the faculty members of the
future.''
   Edward Fort, chancellor at North Carolina A&amp;T State University,
noted that of the 30 top producing research institutions during the
1988-89 school year, none was a historically black instituion.
   He said it is imperative that greater resources be channeled to
historically black institutions because of statistics that show
members of minority groups constituting 35 percent of the U.S.
population by the year 2020.
   There have been some predictions the nation will be short
700,000 science and technology professionals by the year 2000.
   The seven Midwest universities and their affiliates in the new
grouping are:
   _Indiana University and Xavier and Texas Southern universities.
   _Iowa State University and Tuskegee and Clark Atlanta
universities.
   _The University of Minnesota and Florida A&amp;M and Jackson State
universities.
   _The University of Missouri and University of Arkansas at Pine
Bluff and Delaware State College.
   _Ohio State University and Hampton and North Carolina A&amp;T
universities.
   _Purdue University and Prairie View A&amp;M and Tennessee State
universities.
   _The University of Wisconsin with Alabama A&amp;M and Howard
universities.
   Watkins said his department's effort will receive $4.3 million
to develop curriculum, train students and faculty and recruit
students.
   ``I strongly believe that waste management will be one of the
fastest growing areas of career opportunity during this decade,''
Watkins said. ``And not just at the Ph.D. level or even
baccalaureate level. We need technicians from our two-year
colleges, and we need them badly.''
   The department's partners are Alabama A&amp;M, Clark Atlanta,
Florida A&amp;M, Hampton, Howard, Jackson State, North Carolina A&amp;T,
Xavier, Tuskegee and Prairie View A&amp;M and the universities of New
Mexico Highlands, Northern Arizona, Southern at Baton Rouge, Texas
A&amp;I and Texas at El Paso.

   President Bush presented the National Medal of
Arts on Monday to 13 American artists and patrons whom he credited
with helping define America and make it ``a cultural giant.''
   The recipients at the East Room ceremony included legendary
Broadway director George Abbott, a frail 103-year-old, and dapper
Hume Cronyn, who took a bow when the president revealed that
Barbara Bush was ``secretly in love'' with the 79-year-old actor.
   Among the other medal winners were painter Jasper Johns, soprano
Beverly Sills, blues guitarist B.B. King, choreographer Merce
Cunningham and actress Jessica Tandy, Cronyn's wife, who missed the
event.
   Also, landscape architect Ian McHarg and painter Jacob Lawrence,
as well as art patrons David Lloyd Kreeger of Washington and Harris
and Carroll Masterson of Houston. The Southwestern Bell Corp. was
honored for its corporate sponsorship of the arts.
   Mrs. Bush helped present the silver medals, nestled in walnut
boxes, to each artist and patron. It was the sixth year the White
House has bestowed the honors, which are organized by the National
Endowment for the Arts.
   ``Embracing an era that reaches back as far as George Abbott's
birth in 1887 and representing many generations of American talent,
our artists stand alongside the artists who helped define America,
no longer just another sprawling industrial nation, but one of the
cultural giants of the world,'' he said.
   ``Most had humble beginnings. I think of Jessica Tandy sewing
her own costumes in a backroom theater in Soho. B.B. King touring
backstreet bars and dance halls ... and on the road for over 20
years before most Americans would ever even hear his name,'' the
president said.
   ``Even their hometown names read like the very tapestry of
America itself: Forestville, N.Y., Centralia, Wash., Itta Bena,
Miss., Brooklyn and Atlantic City,'' said Bush, referring to the
birthplaces of Abbott, Cunningham, King, Sills and Lawrence
respectively.
   Three recipients were foreign born: Cronyn in Canada, Tandy in
England and McHarg in Scotland.
   Bush recalled his wife's advice to Wellesley College graduates
last June to ``go out and seek their own true colors'' and said
that's ``exactly what our honorees have done.''
   ``You've created sights and sounds and characters crafted anew
within the human imagination, and in doing so, enriched the colors
on the canvass on our national life,'' he said.
   Abbott was the first called to the stage to accept the medal.
Leaning on a cane, he got up with an assist from a Marine escort
and Cronyn.
   ``Congratulations, sir,'' said the president.
   ``It is indeed an hono ... I shall value it,'' said Abbott, an
actor and a playwright as well as a director of more than 100
shows, including ``Pal Joey'' and ``A Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum.''
   The Bushes hosted a luncheon for their guests in the State
Dining Room afterwards.
   Bush recalled that he gave out last year's awards to such
``artistic giants'' as Alfred Eisenstaedt, John Updike and Dizzie
Gillespie at a luncheon on the same day he received the national
turkey for Thanksgiving.
   ``With all of that assembled talent, guess which one was
pictured standing next to the president on the national news that
night? The national turkey,'' Bush recalled to laughter. ``We've
done a little better on the scheduling this year, Helsinki
notwithstanding.''

   United Press International is closing its
bureaus in New Mexico, Wyoming and Montana, a spokesman for the
news service said Monday.
   Spokesman Milt Capps confirmed a report on the closures in The
Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune, but declined to specify how many
layoffs were involved.
   The Tribune said UPI's single-person bureau in Santa Fe was
closing on Sept. 21 as part of shutdowns in the three states. Capps
said the newspaper's account was ``essentially correct as far as it
goes.'' He said UPI would not, however, be leaving the three states
uncovered.
   ``We are expanding our stringer network in those states and
exploring a number of joint ventures at the state and regional
level,'' Capps said.
   Last month Capps confirmed a Washington Post report that 31 UPI
reporters and editors were being laid off, but he declined Monday
to provide an up-to-date account of how many have lost their jobs
nationwide.

<HEAD>Russian Orthodox Clergyman Killed En Route to Church</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent Russian Orthodox priest and writer who
had once been persecuted by authorities was killed with an ax while
on his way to church, Tass reported Monday.
   The body of Father Alexander Menn was found Sunday near his
house in Zagorsk north of Moscow, the official news agency said.
Zagorsk is the site of an ancient monastery that is a showplace for
the Russian Orthodox Church.
   Doctors said Menn bled to death on the forest path after being
struck on the head, it said. The report said he was on his way to
church.
   An investigation into the slaying has begun, Tass said. It did
not provide any motive in the killing.
   The news agency described Menn as a human rights campaigner and
ardent opponent of anti-Semitism. It also said he was a ``dissident
in the years of stagnation'' _ a reference to the administration of
former Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, who ruled from 1964-82.
   But Michael Rowe, a spokesman for Keston College in Britain,
which studies religion in communist countries, said Menn kept a low
profile on matters considered to be political and, for that reason,
should not be considered a rights activist.
   ``As a priest, he was more active in getting people to commit
themselves to the church,'' Rowe said. ``In a strictly orthodox
sense, he was an evangelical.''
   Menn was detained by the authorities for questioning on at least
one occasion but he was never held for long, Rowe said.
   Ordained a priest in 1961, Menn was a theologian and church
historian. He wrote several books and articles, including a
children's book. His history of comparative religion was published
in several volumes in Belgium.
   In 1988, with the easing of restrictions on religious
activities, Menn was one of the first priests to be invited to
visit schools and talk to children about the church.

   U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato criticized Japan
on Monday as ``greedy'' for not sending more aid to the Persian
Gulf to help multinational forces aligned against Iraq.
   ``They are acting totally within the character that they usually
do,'' D'Amato, a New York Republican, said of the Japanese. ``They
are motivated by profit, greed and avarice. For them not to step
forward and make a substantial financial contribution to this
mission is unconscionable.
   ``Theirs is an attitude that I think really is repugnant,''
D'Amato said of the Japanese.
   D'Amato said he thought the Japanese ``could find a way to swing
a deal, to make some money to keep people from starving or from
thirst.''
   Officials at the Japanese Consulate in Washington said their
country has pledged $1 billion in aid, mostly through transporting
equipment to Saudi Arabia. They also said Japan stands ready with
further economic help to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey.
   ``Instead of criticizing other countries, it is more important
to strengthen our cooperation and Japan is prepared to cooperate
further with the United States,'' said spokesman Noriyuki Shikata.
   Japan's constitution restricts the military's role to self
defense.
   D'Amato also criticized West Germany for not offering more
economic help and Egypt for not sending more troops.
   ``At times we have had more congressmen in the sands of the
desert visiting than some of our allies have troops,'' D'Amato
said. ``We shouldn't be the lone ranger.''

   Congressional negotiators agreed Monday to
toughen industrial air pollution controls in smoggy areas, bringing
many small businesses under control requirements for the first time.
   The agreement raised hopes that differences between House and
Senate versions of the complex clean air bill could be resolved in
the current session, thus giving the nation the first major
revision of federal air pollution laws in 13 years.
   The sources, who spoke on condition that they not be identified,
said that staff negotiators agreed to accept the tough House
provisions that would require even small polluters to install new
control equipment.
   The agreement, which was expected to be approved by the House
and Senate members of the conference committee, represented the
most significant progress in working out a final clean air bill
since the discussions began in June, environmentalists said.
   ``This is one of the major hurdles,'' said Daniel Weiss, who has
followed the clean air debates for the Sierra Club.
   Different version of the legislation, both of which impose
far-reaching pollution control requirements on automakers, industry
and electric utilities, were approved by the House and Senate early
this year. Progress in resolving differences has been slow.
   The Bush administration had opposed the stronger House
provisions agreed to in the accord Monday, saying that requirements
on small companies to install smog-reducing control devices would
make the legislation too expensive.
   The Senate bill would have required new controls on smog-forming
chemicals from industrial installations releasing more than 100
tons a year of those chemicals in smoggy areas.
   The House bill would lower the cutoff to 50 tons or 25 tons a
year, depending upon the severity of the local smog problem _ and
to 10 tons a year in greater Los Angeles.
   That could bring some dry cleaning plants, bakeries and auto
paint shops under the control requirements.
   The clean air bill, even with the Senate's industrial smog
provisions, has been estimated to cost $25 billion a year when all
its requirements go into effect toward the end of the decade.
   Industry lobbyists have argued in recent weeks that tough new
pollution controls should not be imposed by the government at a
time when the Middle East crisis is causing oil prices to skyrocket
and the economy is on the verge of a recession.
   Congressional sources who have been close to the clean air talks
acknowledged that several controversial parts of the bill have yet
to be tackled, including whether to provide financial assistance to
workers who lose their jobs because of tougher pollution controls.
   Some lawmakers have also suggested that parts of the bill should
be re-examined in light of the Mideast crisis.
   ``We may have to begin to reassess what is realistic,'' said
Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla. He suggested Monday that some pollution
control requirements on the petroleum industry and a mandate for
cleaner fuels might have to be postponed.
   The compromise accepted by the staff negotiators Monday
generally accepted all the House provisions in the sections of the
bill dealing with industrial sources of smog and failure by cities
to meet federal clean air standards.
   The compromise included a House provision that the federal
government may continue to impose air pollution control plans on
cities that do not have satisfactory plans. The Senate version
would have ended that authority.

   American relief agencies are gearing up
to help thousands of Asians stranded in squalid, ill-equipped
refugee camps in the desert of Jordan after fleeing from Iraq and
Kuwait.
   ``We're anticipating a great expansion of our relief work in
Jordan,'' said Jeffrey M. Sellers, spokesman for Monrovia,
Calif.-based World Vision. ``The situation is very bad, and it
looks like it's not going to get better any time soon.''
   The Jordanian government is desperate for whatever help it can
get, Stephen M. Johnson, president of AmeriCares, said hours after
returning from the Jordan airlift.
   ``They're faced with this situation that looks like 3,000 coming
in every hour, certainly tens of thousands a day, and they're
trying to keep them fed and in reasonable health and get them
home,'' he said.
   Desert camps in Jordan have become temporary homes for tens of
thousands of Asians who fled Iraq and Kuwait after Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion.
   Most of the evacuees arrived in Jordan without food, water or
money. They have been living in the desert camps, many in makeshift
tents, lining up for hours each day for their shares of inadequate
supplies of water and food.
   Technical and bureaucratic problems have slowed their home
governments' efforts to feed them and transport them home.
   AmeriCares, a private relief organization based in New Canaan,
during the weekend sent the first private shipment of food and
medical supplies to the camps, and Westport-based Save the
Children, a child assistance agency, is coordinating food and water
distribution in the largest camp, officials said.
   AmeriCares sent 75,000 pounds of canned tuna fish, rice,
packaged cheese, powdered milk, peanut butter, dried soup, aspirin
and blankets, Johnson said. The airlift left Saturday from Bradley
International Airport in Windsor Locks and returned Monday.
   The group plans another airlift later this week, Johnson said.
``We have 89,000 pounds of stuff that didn't get on our first
plane,'' he said.
   Save the Children is the only organization with workers in the
largest evacuee camp, called Sha'alan No. 1, said Wendy Christian,
the group's spokeswoman. At least 50,000 people are in that camp,
she said.
   But Christian said workers have found it difficult to keep up
with orderly distribution of food and water because so many new
people arrive each day.
   World Vision was organizing an airlift of cookware, water
containers, tarpaulins, bandages, rope, blankets and water
purification tablets, Sellers said. The airlift would probably
leave Tuesday night, he said.
   Santa Barbara, Calif.-based Direct Relief International, which
donates medicine and medical supplies, planned to send 4,000 pounds
of supplies Tuesday or Wednesday, including antibiotics, bandages,
and surgical instruments, among other items, said program officer
Jerrel Sorensen.
   The Washington-based American Red Cross donated more than
$75,000 to the International Red Cross relief effort, said
spokeswoman Ann Stingle.
   But Stingle said private donations were just trickling in, with
just $4,293 sent from the American public so far and just $3,732
pledged.
   ``Disasters and relief efforts vary from one to the other,'' she
said, adding also that because the relief effort wasn't heavily
publicized until last week, it may take more time to get donations.

   Federal parole officers recommended Monday
that impeached federal judge Walter L. Nixon be sent back to prison
for breaking parole by carrying a gun on a turkey hunt.
   Two parole officers decided on that recommendation after a
parole revocation hearing at which an investigator said Nixon had
asked him to pretend he wasn't carrying two guns _ a rifle and a
shotgun _ when he was arrested on hunting violations April 25.
   Chester Diaz, a state Department of Wildlife special
investigator, also testified that, after Nixon was arrested, he
asked to switch the guns for an old-fashioned muzzleloader.
   Nixon said ``he was liable to be in serious trouble with those
guns. He asked me to switch them,'' Diaz said.
   ``He asked me to swap them out. I told him `No sir,' '' said
Diaz.
   Nixon, 61, had been on parole since November 1989, the same
month the U.S. Senate stripped him of his $89,500-a-year judgeship.
Nixon was convicted in 1986 of lying to a federal grand jury.
   Nixon testified Monday that he didn't hunt or take his guns from
their cases the day he was arrested.
   Nixon apologized: ``I ask for your compassion and mercy. I know
that I did wrong and I regret it with all my heart.''
   Parole officer Herb Lepchenske said he will recommend that Nixon
serve 10 months of the remaining three years on his five-year
prison sentence.
   ``You basically admitted to possession of firearms,'' Lepchenske
said.
   Nixon and former state game warden Austin Shattles were
convicted two months ago in Jackson County of conspiracy to hunt
over a baited field. Nixon also was convicted of hunting wild
turkey over a baited field.
   Both men are appealing.
   The officers will forward their recommendation to the
seven-member Parole Commission in Atlanta, which will review the
case and then vote on whether to revoke Nixon's parole.
   A decision is expected within three weeks, the parole officers
said.

   Thirty-two railroads received no federal
inspections last year, the General Accounting Office said Monday in
a report criticizing the Transportation Department's safety
regulation.
   The GAO report, prepared at the request of the heads of House
and Senate commerce committees, said the Federal Railroad
Administration, a part of the Transportation Department, ``has not
established inspection coverage standards for the various types of
inspections.''
   The agency ``generally agreed with GAO's findings,'' the report
said, noting that officials had agreed to create a new position of
director of training and communication.
   The agency has safety responsibility for the nation's
approximately 500 railroads. The report released Monday said that
32 had no inspections whatsoever in 1989. Only operating practices,
not track and equipment, was inspected at 168 others.
   Because there are no uniform monitoring standards, the
congressional investigative agency said, federal rail inspectors
``do not have guidance on how often railroads' equipment, track,
signals or operating practices need to be inspected.''
   The GAO said that the uninspected railroads typically ``were the
smaller, short-line railroads which have higher accident and injury
rates than overall industry averages.''
   Reacting to the report, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of
the House Energy and Commerce Committee said that ``for the third
time in the last 15 months, the GAO has demonstrated that the
Federal Railroad Administration's past claims of an effective rail
safety program are suspect or hollow.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly 100 women could get out of prison
in Ohio because they were convicted before a court ruling that said
battered-woman syndrome can be used as a defense in killings or
assaults.
   The Ohio Parole Board has held hearings in 86 cases, and at
least 11 more are planned.
   The board is deciding whether to recommend clemency, Mary Helen
Van Dyke, spokeswoman for the Department of Rehabilitation and
Correction, said Monday.
   No recommendations have yet been sent to Gov. Richard Celeste,
who has the authority to reduce sentences or issue pardons.
Recommendations were expected to be sent to the governor in about
two weeks, Ms. Van Dyke said.
   There were 2,026 women in the state's penal system as of Monday.
Ms. Van Dyke said the Ohio Supreme Court decision in March would
not affect the vast majority of them.
   Celeste supported the court decision, and a new law permitting
expert testimony on battered woman syndrome, a psychological state
brought on by longterm abusive relationships.
   The decision and the new law made Ohio the last state in the
nation to allow such testimony, said state Rep. Joseph Koziura,
whose bill becomes law Nov. 5.
   The court said an expert could testify against misconceptions
that women enjoy the beatings and that they intentionally provoke
their husbands into rage.
   Ms. Van Dyke said officials reviewed records and made a list of
women who might be eligible for consideration because courts
refused to allow testimony on battered-woman sydrome. Others who
have attorneys have come forward, Ms. Van Dyke said.

   Mass murderer Richard Speck, who's
serving up to 1,200 years for the 1966 murders of eight student
nurses in Chicago, was denied parole Monday for the seventh time.
   The Illinois Prison Review Board made the decision without
comment and set his next hearing for September 1993, board
spokesman Joel Volpe said.
   Speck didn't attend his parole hearing Thursday at Stateville
Correctional Center near Joliet, where he is jailed. But about two
dozen friends and relatives of the victims went to the hearing and
asked that Speck be kept in prison.
   In a crime that drew national attention and was dubbed at the
time ``the crime of the century,'' Speck stabbed and strangled the
young women in their townhouse dormitory near the South Chicago
Community Hospital nursing school.
   He originally was sentenced to death. But the U.S. Supreme Court
overturned the sentence, and he was re-sentenced to eight
consecutive prison terms of 50 to 150 years.

<HEAD>Pope Ends African Tour by Blessing Big `Basilica in the Bush'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>YAMOUSSOUKRO, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II ended a tour
of four African nations Monday by blessing a huge basilica
criticized as needlessly opulent in this land of economic scarcity.
   The consecration of the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in the
birthplace of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny was one of the high
points of the pope's 10-day trip to Africa. Later in the day, the
pontiff flew on to Rome, arriving in his Air Afrique DC-10 at 11:50
p.m.
   In Yamoussoukro, Houphouet-Boigny's hometown, tight security was
in place to prevent anti-government demonstrations by recently
legalized opposition parties during the papal visit.
   Houphouet-Boigny, who has ruled the country as a one-party state
since independence from France in 1960, offered the basilica as a
gift to the pope during a private audience last year at the Vatican.
   Cost estimates range from $140 million to $300 million for the
basilica, which was packed to capacity for the consecration Mass.
In the plaza outside, tens of thousands of pilgrims followed the
service on television monitors and loudspeakers.
   Organizers had indicated they expected up to 350,000 people, but
some may have been discouraged by the armed soldiers stationed in
and around the city.
   There were no major incidents. But police clubbed some people in
the crush of worshipers pushing out of the basilica after the pope
left, news photographers said.
   The cost of the basilica, which was completed last year, has
been a source of controversy in this once-prosperous West African
nation now suffering its worst economic crisis in 30 years of
independence.
   At the start of the consecration Mass, a senior Vatican official
delivered a strong defense of the basilica.
   ``Africa rejoices to have such a place to worship God,'' said
Cardinal Francis Arinze, a Nigerian who heads the Vatican office on
inter-religous dialogue.
   In his homily, the Polish-born pope, too, appeared to defend the
right of Africans to their own basilica. ``During all ages and on
all continents, the sons of the church have dedicated the best of
their art'' to their faith, he said.
   The colossal church, rising out of a former cocoa plantation
owned by the president in this town of 70,000, bears a striking
resemblance to St. Peter's in Rome with its imposing dome and long
arms of marble columns surrounding a plaza.
   The basilica, set on a 320-acre site, is 525 feet high at its
tip, compared with 452 feet at the top of the cross on the dome of
St. Peter's. The basilica has 15,000 panels of hand-blown French
stained glass.
   The basilica seats 7,000 people and another 11,000 standing. The
entire grounds can accommodate more than 350,000 worshipers.
   Its architect, Pierre Fakhoury, has described the new basilica
as the biggest church in Christendom. Vatican officials, however,
said they believed St. Peter's is larger.
   Houphouet-Boigny says the basilica cost $140 million, was built
on his own land and was paid for with his family's money.
   But published reports have said the price tag could be as high
as $300 million, and the president's opponents accused him of
misappropriating state money for the project.
   Whatever the cost, critics have said the money would have been
better spent on education and health care for the poor.
   The Vatican issued a written statement that appeared aimed at
deflecting the criticism and underlining the social benefits of the
church. At the pope's request, a hospital and other assistance
projects will be built on the grounds.
   The statement said Houphouet-Boigny had made available money for
the maintenance of the complex, which will also include a radio
station and university offices.
   The site will be managed by the Our Lady of Peace International
Foundation, under Vatican control.
   ``In accepting the donation and in establishing the Our Lady of
Peace Foundation, the Holy Father wishes to contribute to the good
of Ivorians and other Africans,'' the Vatican statement said.
   During the Mass, the pope sat on a throne-like chair under a
brocaded canopy rising nine stories above the altar.
   Houphouet-Boigny, who converted to Catholicism in his youth,
hopes the basilica will become a pilgrimage center for Africa's 75
million faithful. About 10 percent of Ivory Coast's 10 million
residents are Catholics, with one-fourth Moslems and most of the
rest animists.
   The pope's seventh trip to Africa also included stops in
Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda.

   The military-backed caretaker
government Monday charged ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto with
corruption, escalating its campaign against her in the weeks
leading up to national elections.
   Ms. Bhutto called the charges an act of desperation and
declared, ``We will not take this lying down.'' She said the
government was trying to disqualify her and her party from the Oct.
24 elections.
   She was charged before a special, one-judge court set up in
Karachi to try cases of official graft and possibly bar candidates
from the voting.
   Judge Wajihuddin Ahmed will decide this week whether to accept
the charges and serve formal notice to Ms. Bhutto. She has
previously said she will not appear. If she refuses, legal experts
say she could be arrested.
   In addition, the caretaker government said it plans to file
criminal charges against her.
   Ms. Bhutto on Monday went to file her nomination papers as a
candidate representing Lyari, the sprawling slum in central Karachi
that is home to 1 million people. But after hearing of the charges,
she postponed filing until Tuesday.
   Ms. Bhutto won the Lyari seat in parliament in the November 1988
election that installed her as the first woman to lead a modern
Moslem nation.
   Later Monday, she told a crowded news conference at her home on
the Arabian Sea that the caretaker government and the man who
ousted her, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, were trying to disqualify
her and her Pakistan People's Party from the elections.
   ``We want to take part in the election, and we won't give in,''
she said. ``We will not take this lying down, and we won't leave
the field.''
   She said the People's Party had formed an alliance with three
smaller centrist parties to fight the election under the banner of
the People's Democratic Alliance.
   ``We might not have been the perfect government, and we might
have made mistakes,'' she said. ``But compared with the caretaker
government and the previous government, we were much more honest
and competent.''
   According to the charges, the 37-year-old former prime minister
abused her power by appointing a consulting firm to oversee a power
project financed by the Asian Development Bank. She is also charged
with awarding a lucrative contract to a British company to export
cotton at prices substantially below the international market rate.
No other details were given.
   If convicted, she could be barred not only from next month's
election but from politics for seven years.
   Ms. Bhutto's lawyer, former Interior Minister Aitzaz Ahsan, said
the charges were ``a political vendetta'' and would be challenged
in court.
   ``Ishaq Khan is frightened of her popular support and fearful of
victory. He is desperately seeking to disqualify her to prevent her
return.''
   Ishaq Khan dismissed Ms. Bhutto's 20-month-old government on
Aug. 6, citing widespread corruption, abuse of power and political
incompetence.
   The caretaker government, comprised largely of Ms. Bhutto's
opponents, has spent much of the past month trying to portray her
administration as the most corrupt in Pakistan's 43-year history
and to weaken her party's electoral chances. At least five former
Cabinet ministers and Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, have
been charged with corruption.
   Despite allegations made daily in Pakistani newspapers, the
government has provided no solid proof to back up the claims.
   Western diplomats have said Pakistan could lose hundreds of
millions of dollars in economic and military aid if Ms. Bhutto is
victimized or if the elections are rigged.
   Even though she now has been charged, many people are skeptical
about the government's willingness to actually put her on trial.
   Although most Pakistanis showed little sympathy when she was
dismissed, a trial could bring back memories of the events
following the 1977 military overthrow of her father, Prime Minister
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and his hanging two years later.

   A Cuban exile who had been a fugitive for 12
years until his arrest last spring pleaded guilty Monday to
conspiring to kill a former Chilean diplomat who died in a 1976 car
bombing on Washington's Embassy Row.
   Jose Dionisio Suarez Esquivel, who had been a fugitive until his
arrest last spring, admitted participating in the conspiracy to
murder Orlando Letelier, who died with associate Ronni Moffitt when
a bomb exploded beneath their car on Sept. 21, 1976.
   Two top-ranking officials of the Chilean military junta in power
at the time of the killing are also charged with participating in
the conspiracy. But the Chilean government has refused to extradite
the former officials.
   Two other men have pleaded guilty in the case.
   Suarez, 51, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to murder an
internationally protected person.
   The offense carries a possible life sentence but in a deal
accepted by U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr., Suarez will
not receive more than a 12-year prison term. No date was set for
sentencing.
   Under the plea agreement, prosecutors agreed to dismiss four
other charges against Suarez. The government also promised not to
prosecute Suarez's wife, Elizabeth Gongora Suarez, for concealing a
fugitive.
   Mrs. Suarez sobbed softly as her husband entered the guilty plea
in federal court.
   Suarez was arrested April 11 in St. Petersburg, Fla., where he
had been living with his wife and son, who is now 20 months old.
   Letelier was an outspoken critic of the military regime of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, which deposed Allende in a bloody coup in 1973.
He had served Allende's government as foreign minister and as
ambassador to the United States.
   Pinochet's government surrendered power to an elected civilian
government earlier this year. But so far, the civilian government
has refused to extradite retired Gen. Juan Manuel Contreras
Sepulveda and Lt. Col. Pedro Espinoza Bravo, former chief of the
Chilean security agency DINA.
   Michael Vernon Townley, an American-born DINA agent, pleaded
guilty in 1978 to planting the bomb beneath Letelier's car and
served a 40-month prison term.
   In 1987, a Chilean army major, Armando Fernandez Larios, fled
his country and pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact
of the killing.
   Fernandez told investigators that he believed that Pinochet had
ordered the killing, but offered no direct evidence.
   Both Townley and Fernandez had been expected to testify against
Suarez, who was scheduled to go on trial next week.
   Suarez, a member of the Cuban Nationalist Movement, admitted
that in Sept. 1976 he met in New Jersey with Townley and others to
discuss the murder of Letelier, according to a statement of facts
filed by prosecutors.
   Suarez traveled to Washington three days before the bombing and
gave Townley a blasting cap he knew would be used to make the bomb,
the statement said. Suarez, Townley and others went to Letelier's
home the next day and planted the bomb on the former diplomat's
automobile.
   The bomb was detonated two days later as Letelier's car was
rounding Sheridan Circle, killing both him and Ms. Moffitt.
   Ms. Moffitt was a colleague at the Institute for Policy Studies,
a liberal think-tank where Letelier worked. Moffitt's husband,
Michael, who was in the back seat, was injured by the blast.
   Investigators believe that Suarez may have detonated the bomb
with an electronic device from an automobile that he and Virgilio
Paz Romero, who is still a fugitive, used to follow Letelier's car,
said a source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Defense attorney Paul Goldberger said Suarez's main concern in
pleading guilty was to enable his wife to avoid prosecution.

   Iraq cannot be allowed to get away with its
occupation of Kuwait, first lady Barbara Bush said Monday.
   To Saddam Hussein's complaint that the United Nations embargo is
threatening the lives of Iraq's children, Mrs. Bush said, ``He went
into a country and attacked it. We can't forget that.''
   Asked what she would tell the Iraqi president if she could send
a message to him, the first lady said, ``I'd rather send a message
to our soldiers and tell them we want them home and that we're
doing everything we can for peace.''
   Near tears, she added that she hoped the Iraqi leader will
``take into consideration these children, and that you just can't
go into a country and just take it over and expect people who are
in a league with them, as we are at the United Nations, to sit back
and say, `Oh, too bad.'
   ``It just doesn't work that way in our world. And if it works
that way, there's something wrong with us as there was in World War
II when we sat back and let country after country go, saying, `This
isn't happening,''' said Mrs. Bush in an extensive interview with
news agency reporters.
   She said the president is handling the crisis with equanimity
and keeping a ``wonderful'' disposition.
   ``I don't think it's ever off his mind, but does he dwell on it?
No,'' she said.
   On other matters, Mrs. Bush:
   _Revealed her pet dog Millie has a case of lupus but ``she's in
complete remission.'' Millie's rambunctious year-old pup Ranger has
taken up permanent residence in the White House, having outgrown
the suburban yard of son Marvin Bush and family.
   _Complained that Neil Bush has been singled out for scrutiny in
the savings and loan scandal only because he is the president's
son. ``It's darn unfair that they're only doing it to hurt George
Bush ... and they have succeeded,'' she said.
   _Advised American women soldiers in Saudi Arabia chafing under
Saudi restrictions to ``stick with the customs of the country.''
   _Said Raisa Gorbachev was ``very concerned about the problems in
her country.'' The Soviet president's wife is also having troubles
with winning acceptance as the first wife of a Soviet leader's wife
to seek a public role.
   Mrs. Bush said the standoff in the Middle East is the worst
crisis Bush has faced in the 20 months of his presidency.
   She said ``I'm not a prophet,'' but expressed hope that a way
will be found to avert war.
   Asked if she had been offering the president advice on the
crisis, she said ``No.''
   ``I think wives in my case, under our system, do very well to
aid and comfort their husband and keep trying to make life as
peaceful as you can at home _ not needle, not give suggestions,''
she said.
   ``Of course, if I had a good idea I'd say, `Would this work?'
and they said `We've done it' usually,'' she added.
   Mrs. Bush, sitting by a picture window overlooking the Rose
Garden and Oval Office on the second floor of the White House,
patted her three-year-old English springer spaniel as she spoke.
   Millie is the star of a new as-told-to ``autobiography'' about
life in the White House. Mrs. Bush, the ghostwriter of ``Millie's
Book,'' undertook the project to raise funds for her literacy
foundation, which last Friday awarded its first $500,000 in grants.
   ``I think it's very easy reading,'' said Mrs. Bush of the $17.95
hardcover book, replete with scores of pictures of Millie with her
pups, the president, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and other VIPs.
   On Ranger's move from Alexandria, Va., she said, ``Marvin and
Margaret didn't really have room for Ranger and George loved him
so. And I said to Geroge, `How come you like Ranger so much?' And
he said, 'Never had a dog all my own before.'
   ``Well, it isn't all his own. It belongs to Marshall Bush,'' she
said, referring to her 4-year-old granddaughter.
   ``Millie has not been supplanted,'' she said. And despite George
Bush's fondness for Ranger, the first lady noted that the job of
walking Ranger ``at five in the morning'' falls to her.
   On the federal probe of her son Neil's role as an outside
director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association in
Denver _ whose collapse has been estimated to cost the taxpayers $1
billion _ Mrs. Bush said he is under investigation solely ``because
he's Neil Bush. He's the only outside director I've ever heard of
.... who has been investigated like this.''
   ``He's going to be innocent, but it's going to cost him a lot of
time and money and grief and business to find out he's innocent and
I just think it's darn unfair that they're only doing it to hurt
George Bush, not to hurt Neil Bush. And they have succeeded,'' she
said.
   At their weekend meeting in Helsinki, Mrs. Gorbachev pressed her
for information on how much things cost, from lipstick to caviar.
``I'm the worst person to talk to. I don't go to a grocery store,''
she confessed.
   ``She's the first wife of a leader that (the Soviet people) have
ever seen,'' Mrs. Bush said. She ``doesn't have any staff at all.
And yet she's trying to do somewhat the same things as we do.''
   ``That's the one thing we really have in common. She loves her
husband and she is trying to help him as hard as she can.''

   A group of former Middle East hostages reached
the United States Monday, and one woman among the 164 on the
freedom flight stopped to kiss the ground as she got off the
jetliner that brought her home.
   ``It's good to be home,'' said an exhausted Philadelphia woman,
who had been in Kuwait to visit to her brother and was trapped
after Iraq invaded last month.
   ``It's a ghost town. Everything is broken down. They (the
Iraqis) stole everything. Supermarkets, there is no food,'' she
said.
   The woman identified herself by her first name, Angel, saying
she wanted to protect her brother and his family, whom she left
behind in Kuwait.
   The plane carried 164 former hostages, most of them women and
children, who went to customs on their way to a red-white-and blue
welcome set up by state officials in a hangar at at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport.
   State officials wore yellow ribbons and decorated tables in red,
white and blue to create a festive atmosphere.
   ``We have customs and immigration officers, child care,
counselors, and psychologists ready to help. There's the Red Cross
and the Salvation Army, and hostess stations with beverages and
food,'' said Helen Szablya, director of public information of the
state Department of Human Resources.
   Angel said Kuwait resident are afraid the Iraqis will cut off
their water and electricity, and hope the United States will take
some action.
   The former hostage said she went into hiding for five weeks
following the invasion.
   ``I could not even go to the window,'' she said.
   The 164 were part of a group of 438 former hostages who arrived
at London late Sunday after a flight from Baghdad. About 20 aren't
U.S. citizens, Ms. Szablya said.
   Others evacuated or escaped from Iraq and Kuwait reached their
destinations around the nation, telling tales of evading Iraqi
soldiers. A Texas man said he hid for a week in a ceiling air
conditioning duct before escaping in disguise.
   At Baltimore-Washington International Airport, four computer
terminals were set up to help the weary passengers make further
travel arrangements. A bank established a desk to provide loans.
   Elsewhere, Holly Van Rossum of Bremerton, Wash., arrived at
Seattle early Monday with her two daughters, but left her husband
behind in a hideout in Kuwait City.
   ``It wasn't an easy choice,'' said Mrs. Van Rossum, 35. ``If we
had an opportunity to get the children out we had to do that. My
husband said it was easier for him if he knew they were safe.
   ``Things were starting to get tense. They had started rounding
up civilians.''
   Rhonda Mased, 32, her husband, Zuhair, and their three small
children also arrived at Seattle.
   ``All she could do was shake, the relief was so great,'' said
Rhonda's mother, Elizabeth Cox. She said her daughter taught school
in Kuwait for the past 10 years.
   Cox said the family drove 11 hours through the desert from
Kuwait to Baghdad. The family was held for two days at the
Iraq-Jordan border because of their car's Kuwaiti license plates,
Cox said.
   One returnee disputed stories of some returning hostages who
told of mistreatment by Iraqi soldiers.
   ``I was there for five weeks,'' Mrs. Hoffman said. ``I have
encountered Iraqi soldiers a number of times. ... They have been
extremely courteous,'' said Barbara Hoffman, who returned home
Monday to McKinney, Texas.
   Petroleum engineer Jimmy Hawkins of Dallas told of his long,
complicated route out of Kuwait. He was among the more than 300
U.S. evacuees who landed Sunday at Charleston, S.C.
   After Iraqi troops occupied his Kuwait City apartment building,
Hawkins said he hid in a ceiling duct for a week and a Jordanian
friend in the Kuwaiti resistance took him food and water.
   The two tried to escape Sept. 4 by car. They were arrested in
Basra, Iraq, and spent two days in jail before bribing a police
officer for their release, he said.
   ``I was dressed as an Arab, playing deaf and dumb,'' Hawkins
said.
   They hitched a ride to Baghdad with unsuspecting Iraqi army
soldiers.
   Hawkins said he obtained fake Lebanese papers and took a taxi to
the Jordanian border. After being turned back, Hawkins said he
crossed into Jordan on foot.
   ``I ran through the desert about 10 kilometers (six miles),''
Hawkins said, before coming across Jordanian desert police.
   In the days after the Aug. 2 invasion, Hawkins said, ``There was
resistance. There's fighting nightly. There were bullets flying and
bombs going off every day. ... (The resistance) is very brave and
well organized but they're low on equipment and badly outnumbered.''

<TEXT>
   Jack Nicholson on Monday was named Commander of
Arts and Letters, France's top award for excellence in the arts.
   Culture Minister Jack Lang presented the 53-year-old star of
``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and ``Chinatown'' with the
green-and-white-striped ribbon before a crush of photographers.
   ``Your angular eyebrows, your ironic smile, your taste for
exaggeration have etched out characters who are memorable,
sometimes satanic,'' Lang said at the ceremony. ``The French public
and I share a great fondness for you.''
   Nicholson was in France to promote his most recent movie, ``The
Two Jakes,'' a sequel to ``Chinatown,'' for which he is both star
and director.
   Accepting the honor, Nicholson said in halting French, reading
from a note, ``I hope that the quality of my French will not make
you take back this decoration, which I consider a great treasure.
... Thank you, my friends, for coming.''
   In an interview with the television network La Cinq, Nicholson
called France his ``second country'' and said, ``I've had such
wonderful luck here. I don't think that happens too often. I had
been working for a long time as an actor befor I went to Cannes the
first time officially.''
   That was in 1968, when the film ``Easy Rider'' was first shown
publicly, he said.
   Asked which directors' work he admired most, he cited Orson
Welles, John Huston and Akira Kurosawa.
   ``You have to borrow somewhat the techniques of the people who
know how to make this kind of material stand up, and Welles of
course is one of the greats,'' Nicholson said.
   ``I think John and Kurosawa have a lot in common about how they
handle action: not too many points of view. I remember how after
John had made `The Dead,' he said, `You know, Jack, I'm very
interested to see how the American public will react to a film in
which the most dramatic thing that happens is the breaking of a
wishbone.' I thought this guy was very big.''
   Nicholson, who played the villain Joker in the blockbuster
``Batman,'' said he had developed a new rapport with children since
that film, which spawned an entire industry of spinoff goods from
lunch boxes to bed sheets.
   ``I worked in the theater in Grand Guignol (productions designed
to shock and horrify audiences), so I understand the mixture of the
children and the adult audience,'' he said.
   ``For instance, a lot more children talk to me since Batman, and
they all love the Joker, they're crazy over the Joker, which might
worry someone _ he's after all not really a nice man,'' he said.
   ``But if you ask the same child who they want to be, they want
to be Batman, which I think is the way that form works.''
   Attending the ceremony with Nicholson, who also starred in such
movies as ``The Shining'' and ``The Border,'' was his American
companion Rebecca Broussard.

<TEXT>
   Three years after challenging the Soviets to
topple the Berlin Wall, Ronald Reagan has returned to stroll across
the old ``death strip'' where chunks of the wall are now peddled as
tourist souvenirs.
   Reagan, 79, accompanied by his wife Nancy, arrived in West
Berlin at 12:20 a.m. Tuesday aboard the late publisher Malcolm
Forbes' private Boeing 727 with the jaunty slogan ``Capitalist
Tool'' painted on its tail.
   The former president is beginning a 10-day trip that will
include stops in Poland, the Soviet Union and Italy.
   Reagan has come back to a city vastly changed since 1987 when he
stood near the infamous Cold War barrier andchallenged Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to ``tear down this wall.''
   The Berlin Wall has come down, and East and West Germans mingle
freely on the streets. Their governments have agreed to unify on
Oct. 3 into one German nation which will be a member of NATO.
   Ulrich Abshagen, a West Berliner active in U.S.-German
friendship programs, said he heard Reagan's speech at the wall in
June 1987 but doubted the barrier would open in his lifetime. Yet
the 60-year-old businessman went ahead and bet a case of champagne
the wall would soon be opened.
   On Wednesday, Reagan is scheduled to visit the area where he
spoke at a celebration of Berlin's 750th anniversary.
   ``There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be
unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom
and peace,'' Reagan said during the speech directed at Gorbachev.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate,'' Reagan said. ``Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this wall.''
   The first sections of the wall opened in November after the
pro-democracy revolution swept out East Germany's communist rulers
and Gorbachev indicated the Soviets would not stop moves toward
German reunification.
   ``Everyone knew the Russian troops would not interfere,'' said
Gerhard Behrendt, an environmental official in the new East German
government. ``Gorbachev spoke on a Friday, and on Tuesday the old
system was finished.''
   Reagan, 79, plans to walk through the landmark Brandenburg Gate,
which is now surrounded by tourists and vendors selling pieces of
the wall, bits of East Bloc army uniforms and postcards showing the
celebrations last November.
   Reagan is scheduled to meet for dinner Tuesday with Berlin
community leaders.
   In Warsaw, he will meet leaders of Poland's Solidarity-led
government and give a speech to Parliament.
   He is also scheduled to address the Supreme Soviet in Moscow and
meet with Gorbachev.
   The BZ daily of the Springer group of newspapers, a partial
sponsor of Reagan's visit to Berlin, praised Reagan for his
``beautiful prophecy'' of 1987.

   The oil-rich Middle Eastern countries are
coming forward quickly with multibillion-dollar pledges of support
for the campaign against Saddam Hussein, but the United States is
having a tougher time with its European and Asian allies, a fact
that hasn't gone unnoticed in Congress.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III announced Monday that
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the exiled government of
Kuwait had pledged $12 billion to help pay for the U.S. defense of
the Persian Gulf and to assist poor nations hurt by their adherence
to the trade embargo against Iraq.
   But Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who heading up a second
high-level fund raising mission, had far less success in obtaining
additional support from France, Britain, South Korea and Japan.
   The European Community did vote Friday to supply $2 billion in
economic assistance to Egypt, Turkey and Jordan _ the three
frontline states which have been hardest hit by the crisis.
   However, the 12-nation European Community said they would not
pay to support the U.S. military presence in the region.
   With the exception of Britain and France, which are already
involved in the military effort, European nations have been leery
of making military contributions, preferring the
less-confrontational approach of supporting poor nations hurt by
the embargo.
   Brady also came away essentially empty-handed following stops in
South Korea and Japan.
   South Korea, which has benefited from U.S. military backing for
more than four decades, pledged to continue funding a few airline
transport flights to Saudi Arabia while Japan said it needed
further time to decide how much it can do beyond the $1 billion in
assistance it has already offered.
   To express displeasure with the level of support, the Senate on
Monday aproved a resolution directing President Bush to submit a
complete accounting of the burden-sharing effort by Nov. 30.
   The resolution warned that countries that failure to do their
fair share could mean a ``detrimental impact'' on their relations
with the United States.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called Japan's $1 billion pledge only
a ``few token shillings.'' He contended that a more adequate
response given Japan's economic standing would be an $8 billion
pledge.
   ``The contemptible tokenism of the actions of the Japanese
government to date merit nothing but the world's contempt and
American hostility,'' McCain said. ``If combat arises, it will not
be Japanese boys whose lives are at risk, it will be American
boys.''
   Even the $12 billion contribution being made by the oil rich
states did not impress some U.S. consumer groups, who charged that
consumers from America and other countries were in reality footing
the bill through higher energy prices.
   According to an early breakdown on costs, the United States was
looking for the Saudis to supply $4 billion for an economic
assistance package which will total $10.5 billion and an additional
$500 million a month to offset U.S. military costs.
   But Edwin Rothschild, head of Citizen Action, said the Saudis
stood to make an extra $3.2 billion monthly from the crisis based
on a $10-a-barrel rise in oil costs from the $18 per barrel average
in July before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and a 2-million-barrel per
day increase in Saudi production.
   ``The king of Saudi Arabia isn't digging into his own pockets to
compensate the United States,'' Rothschild said. ``In reality it is
American and other consumers around the world who are footing the
bill for the military. It is simply a transfer of money.''
   Both West Germany and Japan face internal domestic debates over
how deeply the two defeated World War II nations should get
embroiled in military operations.
   Baker's delegation will not stop in West Germany until later
this week, but the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl has already
let it be known that while it is willing to offer planes and ships
to transport U.S. troops to the region it is not willing to offset
the huge financial costs of keeping American troops in the region.
   The Bush administration has been stressing the need for a united
allied front to convince Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that the
trade embargo against his country will not waiver, something
analysts say is not helped by the lukewarm reception by some allied
countries.
   ``The appearance of disagreement and disunity undermines the
effectiveness of the sanctions,'' said Kimberly Elliott, a research
associate for the Institute for International Economics in
Washington.
   But one official who made the 18,500-mile odyssey with Brady
insisted that the internal wrangling over details of the
compensation package was only a temporary setback to the unity
effort.
   ``It's where you come out a month or two from now that counts,''
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We want
Saddam Hussein to look out and see a blank wall around him.''

<TEXT>
   A 77-year-old grandmother went to jail
Monday because she refuses to tell a judge where her daughter and
granddaughters have been for five years in a child-custody dispute.
   Mary Pigeon said nothing as she stood before Superior Court
Judge Mark A. Pfeiffer for the five-minute hearing.
   In previous hearings she has remained silent or has denied
knowing the trio's whereabouts, angering Pfeiffer, who has accused
her of lying.
   By noon, she was being processed through prison security, headed
for the minimum-security section of the Adult Correctional
Institutions in Cranston, said prison spokesman Joseph DiNitto.
   Pfeiffer, who had given Mrs. Pigeon until Monday to tell him
where her daughter, Elaine Yates, and the girls were hiding, said
she would remain in prison until she talked.
   ``I feel very sad about it, and I wish Elaine would come home,''
Mrs. Pigeon said later as she and her lawyer pushed through a mob
of reporters outside the courthouse. ``Please come home, darling,
with your children. We all love you.''
   But Neil Philbin, attorney for Russell M. Yates Jr., the girls'
father, put little stock in Mrs. Pigeon's denials of knowing where
her daughter and granddaughters are.
   ``I believe Elaine will know within the hour what has happened
this morning. She is so ruthless that she would allow her mother to
stay in prison rather than return the children,'' Philbin said.
   Mrs. Yates and the children, Kimberly Ann, then 3, and Kelly
Ann, then 10 months, left their Warwick home in August 1985 after
Mrs. Yates found her husband with another woman on the family boat.
   Yates later acknowledged hitting his wife and cutting her
forehead with a diamond ring when they argued about the incident.
After she left, he sued for the children's custody and won it when
Mrs. Yates did not contest it. He then sued Mrs. Pigeon, seeking
the girls' return.
   The couple has not divorced because Yates says he does not want
to give his wife the legal opportunity to change her and the girls'
names.
   Sending his mother-in-law to prison ``doesn't faze me,'' Yates
said. ``Why should it? She's going there by her own volition.''
   Pfeiffer already has ruled that Mrs. Pigeon participated in the
abduction of her granddaughters and conspired with her daughter to
keep them from their father.
   The judge said he disliked sentencing her to prison until she
talked, ``But we want compliance with the court's order.''
   When Mrs. Pigeon again refused to talk, her lawyer, Daniel
Schrock, immediately requested that she be placed in the
minimum-security prison and that he be allowed to drive her there
instead of having her taken by state marshals. Pfeiffer granted
both requests.
   Yates said he remained optimistic Mrs. Pigeon would reveal the
location of his daughters. Schrock said he might ask the judge to
review the case in a month or two.
   Mrs. Pigeon also has been ordered to pay Yates $23,000 in
damages, but has yet to do so. Beginning in May, she also performed
about 150 hours of community service at the Society For Young
Victims in Newport.
   ``Enough is enough. I think she knows. I think no one thought
this would happen, that she would end up in jail,'' said June
Vlasaty, director of the society. ``It's terrible. I don't want to
see anyone's mother end up in jail.''
   Pfeiffer had said he hoped working with the child-finding agency
would make Mrs. Pigeon sympathetic to Yates' plight, but later
conceded it wasn't working.

   Musicians practiced Verdi's ``Rigoletto''
Monday after settling a contract dispute with the San Francisco
Opera that canceled the opera's opening night for the first time in
the company's 67-year history.
   Opera officials rescheduled the season's start for Saturday,
more than two weeks late.
   The orchestra union tentatively approved a settlement late
Sunday night.
   ``It was a vote so we could get back to work today,'' said
Joanne Eisler, head of the musicians' negotiating committee. ``The
orchestra wants to show the public we're really committed to
putting on the opera in San Francisco.''
   She expected the players to formally ratify the three-year
contract Wednesday, even though its pay increases were less than
what the union sought.
   ``We're delighted to have the orchestra back and beginning
rehearsals. We look forward to doing what we do best _ putting on
opera,'' said opera spokesman Jon Finck.
   The opera's board of directors was expected to approve the
contract Tuesday.
   Opening night, traditionally the glittering start to the city's
social season, originally was set for Aug. 31. But the performance
_ a double bill of Leoncavallo's ``Pagliacci'' and Puccini's ``Suor
Angelica'' was canceled because of the labor dispute.
   The season will start belatedly Saturday with a performance of
``Rigoletto.'' All subsequent performances will go on as scheduled.
   The orchestra's contract expired Aug. 20, and after talks bogged
down the opera called off rehearsals, a move the union termed a
lockout. The opening-night ball and performances through Sept. 14
were also canceled.
   On Sunday, after three days of intense negotiations, the
orchestra tentatively accepted a three-year contract including a
4.5 percent raise in each of the first two years and a 5 percent
raise in the final year, Eisler said.
   Base pay, about $40,000 under the old contract, would rise to
about $46,000 in the third year.
   Musicians originally sought raises of 10, 8 and 8 percent but
eventaully dropped their demand to 4, 5 and 6 percent, she said.
The opera had offered 4 percent each year for three years.
   ``We're very sad we had to fight so hard to get so little,''
said Eisler, a clarinetist.
   The pay still lags behind that of New York's Metropolitan Opera
and other major orchestras, she said.

   The armed forces press office also said a Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front guerrilla was wounded in Sunday's
fighting in San Felipe, a village 45 miles southeast of San
Salvador.
   In another incident, the bodies of five guerrillas were found by
patrols in the northern province of Cabanas, 55 miles northeast of
San Salvador, in an area where troops and rebels have battled the
past few days, the communique said.
   About 72,000 people have been killed in the nearly 11-year-old

   A wildfire torched five
million-dollar homes Monday as it swept out of control across 1,500
acres of coastal brushland north of San Diego.
   Hundreds of firefighters attacked on the ground and aerial
tankers and helicopters dropped fire retardant and water from the
air.
   More than 100 people were evacuated to Del Dios Middle School,
said Tom Custer of the American Red Cross office in San Diego.
   Flames leapt near hillside homes as a huge gray column of smoke
rose so high it was visible 30 miles south in downtown San Diego
and to the northeast in Escondido.
   Charles Renshaw, who works in Escondido, said the fire closed
Del Dios Highway, his main route home to seaside Del Mar.
   ``That smoke was so high and so thick it was like an eclipse,''
said Renshaw. ``The sun just turned out. It was totally shrouded.''
   Five homes were destroyed, said Carold Stein, a spokeswoman for
the California Department of Forestry.
   ``They are 5,000 square-foot homes, million-dollar plus homes,''
she said. Several vehicles also burned.
   The fire started shortly after noon near this exclusive enclave
30 miles north of downtown San Diego, and moved northeast through
shrub-covered hills. One firefighter suffered a knee injury,
officials said.
   More than 600 firefighters on the ground, four air tankers and
three helicopters battled the blaze, said Forestry Capt. Jim Van
Meter.

   A slaying bearing similarities to eight
others has renewed fears a serial killer is stalking a neighborhood
where residents thought a suspect was already in custody.
   ``I don't fit the profile, but what if the guy gets tired of
looking for somebody who fits the profile and wants to kill
anyway?'' asked Pat Monte, who has lived in the Frankford section
five years. ``We're all scared.''
   Police said the death of Michelle Martin, 30, resembled the
others, but said they believed it was unrelated.
   ``We're not looking at it as a serial killer,'' Police
Commissioner Willie Williams said at a press conference Monday
evening. ``We feel there's more than one person involved.''
   Williams said police were looking for a man with whom Ms. Martin
was last seen.
   The victims were women, ages 28 to 68, who were repeatedly
stabbed or bludgeoned. Several had been sexually assaulted. Six
victims died in Frankford, a working-class neighborhood, and the
others were killed nearby or frequented seedy bars in the shadow of
an elevated railway.
   Ms. Martin's partially clothed body was found Saturday in her
apartment. She had been stabbed repeatedly. Police on Monday
declined to comment on whether she had been sexually assaulted.
   She was described as a large, unkempt blonde who wandered from
bar to bar and sometimes sold soft pretzels on the streets.
   ``She hung out everywhere,'' homicide Lt. James Ferguson said.
``She was a bad drinker.''
   She had lived in the $250-a-month apartment where her body was
found about two years, said a building manager who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Leonard Christopher, 38, has been ordered to stand trial on
charges of murder, robbery, possession of an instrument of crime
and abuse of corpse.
   He is charged only in the death of Carol Dowd, 46, whose body
was found April 28 behind a fish market three blocks from the scene
of the latest killing. She had been stabbed 36 times and mutilated.
   Christopher's court-appointed lawyer, Jack McMahon Jr., said
Monday he would seek to have Christopher released on bail.
   ``One of the reasons, obviously, that he's been held without
bail is that he's a suspect in these other killings,'' McMahon
said. ``Unless he dug his way out of the prison, and went down to
Frankford, and dug his way back in, he's not the person that police
have tried to intimate he is.''

<TEXT>
   Gov. James R. Thompson refused to commute the
death sentence Monday of a convicted murderer, paving the way for
Illinois' first execution in 28 years.
   His decision came a day after Oklahoma carried out its first
execution in 24 years.
   Death penalty opponents kept fighting the sentence, even though
Charles Walker himself has said he wants to die rather than stay
behind bars for the 1983 murders of a southern Illinois couple who
he tied to a tree, shot and robbed of $40 and some fishing gear.
   On Monday, lawyers representing two other Illinois death row
inmates filed an emergency application asking the Supreme Court to
stall Walker's death until their case can be heard. They are
seeking class-action status for a lawsuit challenging the state's
lethal injection system.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago last week
declined to hear the case before Walker's scheduled execution date.
   ``We're basically asking the Supreme Court to hold the status
quo until we can present the merits of the case,'' said lawyer
James Bailinson.
   The governor said people from around the world have asked him to
stay or commute the execution.
   ``Significantly, none of these groups include Charles Walker,''
he said. ``If Walker is to change his mind, and he comes back to
me, then I will be available to consider it, and I will consider
it.''
   If Walker's execution by injection is carried out on schedule at
12:01 a.m. Wednesday, it will have taken him nearly five years to
halt his appeals and bring on his death.
   Some legal experts have said that flaws in Walker's sentencing
hearing make it likely his sentence would be overturned if he chose
to appeal it.
   If the Supreme Court decided against granting a stay, Walker,
50, would become the 139th person executed in the United States
since the court's 1976 ruling allowing states to resume use of the
death sentence, and the first in Illinois since 1962.
   Two other states recently resumed executions. Early Monday,
Oklahoma executed Charles Troy Coleman for the shotgun slaying of
someone who walked in on a burglary, the first death sentence
carried out there since 1966. And in June, Arkansas executed John
Edward Swindler for the murder of a Fort Smith, Ark. policeman. It
was the first Arkansas execution since 1964.
   Illinois would be the 16th state to resume executions since 1976.
   Several groups had asked Thompson to commute Walker's sentence,
including the state's Roman Catholic bishops. They wrote to
Thompson saying the death penalty undermines the sanctity of human
life.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Samuel Doe was reported
Monday to have died of gunshot wounds suffered in fighting with
rebels who captured him a day earlier.
   On Sunday, breakaway rebel leader Prince Johnson named himself
president until elections can be held. Shortly after Doe's capture,
however, loyalists named a successor to the former Liberian leader.
   Liberia's main rebel group said Monday it would intensify the
fighting, dashing hopes for an early end to the 8{-month-old civil
war that has left more than 5,000 civilians dead.
   The National Patriotic Front led by Charles Taylor on Monday
demanded withdrawal of the 3,000-member West African force in
Monrovia to quell the fighting, which has often been tribal. The
rebels have also accused Doe of corruption and human rights abuses.
   Although fighters loyal to Johnson control the capital, Taylor's
10,000-member army has overrun most of the rest of Liberia.
   In Washington, the State Department said it had been told by
reliable sources that Doe had died from gunshot wounds suffered in
his legs during a shootout Sunday with rebels loyal to Johnson.
   A State Department spokesman, who asked not to be identified,
said U.S. officials considered the reports confirmation of the
Liberian leader's death.
   ``We have been informed by various sources, including
representatives of rebel forces, that President Doe died ... (from
wounds) that he suffered in the shootout with Johnson's forces over
the weekend,'' the spokesman said.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. quoted witnesses who visited a
Johnson camp near Monrovia as saying Doe's mutilated body was on
display there.
   The witnesses quoted by the BBC did not say how Doe had died.
They said, however, they watched Johnson interrogating Doe about
the disappearance of millions of dollars of state funds during his
10-year rule.
   Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara, chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States, said Monday: ``Now that Doe has
been toppled by Prince Johnson ... it might help the peace process
in Liberia.''
   Both Johnson and Taylor had demanded Doe step down.
   The civil war began after Taylor crossed into the West African
nation of 2.3 million residents from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24. The
task force was dispatched Aug. 24 to end bloodletting that has
often followed tribal lines.
   Taylor declared Monday that his movement would ``intensify its
efforts to bring this crisis to an end by moving into Monrovia at
any expense.'' He spoke in a broadcast over the state radio, which
is behind his lines.
   He has repeatedly claimed to be on the verge of seizing the
capital but has been bogged down in the city's eastern suburbs for
nearly three months. At one point, he claimed his forces killed
Johnson.
   Taylor spokesman Tom Woewiyu said his group will fight until the
regional army pulls out.
   He accused the West Africans of seeking to install ``a puppet
government.''
   ``They have failed to be a peace force,'' Woewiyu told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview from Burkina Faso.
``Their mission has failed, and a prime example is the capture of
Doe by the Prince Johnson group right in their headquarters.''
   Doe was captured outside the headquarters of the West African
task force where he had gone to pay an unscheduled visit to the
force's commander, Lt. Gen. Arnold Quainoo.
   Doe met with Johnson and some of his fighters outside the task
force headquarters in Monrovia, and they quarreled.
   Rebels battled the government troops with guns and grenades,
chasing Doe and his entourage from room to room of the
headquarters. The fighters captured Doe, shooting him in both legs,
and carried him off to their camp.
   In all, 64 people, mostly Doe loyalists, died in the fighting.
   On Monday, Johnson's men continued the hunt for Doe supporters,
killing an unknown number of people, witnesses said. Meanwhile, Doe
loyalists named Brig. Gen. David Nimley acting president.
   Liberia has been without effective government for months. Since
mid-July, Monrovia has been torn by fighting involving the two
rebel armies and Doe loyalists.
   Johnson said Sunday he would run Liberia until an interim
government can be installed under a peace plan proposed by the West
African nations.
   Taylor has said he would honor the results of elections but
would want to head Liberia before holding elections.
   About 2,100 U.S. Marines are based on ships off Monrovia and
assigned to guard the U.S. Embassy and residential compound. They
have evacuated hundreds of foreigners from the city but have orders
not to intervene in the war.
   Doe took power in a bloody 1980 coup that ousted elitist
descendants of freed American slaves who had discriminated against
Liberian natives.
   He is from the Krahn tribe, one of 14 small tribes in Liberia.
Johnson is the son of a Gio, and Taylor is of mixed
Americo-Liberian and native ancestry.

   Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Mad Dads
Inc., an anti-drug and anti-gang group, decided Monday they aren't
mad at each other any more.
   MADD and Mad Dads agreed to settle a federal trademark lawsuit
brought by MADD in November.
   They subitted a document to Chief U.S. District Judge Lyle Strom
of Omaha saying they agreed the suit should be dismissed. Each side
will pay its own legal costs, the document said.
   The judge was expected to sign an order dismissing the lawsuit.
   ``We're just happy,'' said Mad Dads spokesman Eddie Staton.
   MADD and Mad Dads released a brief joint statement saying the
agreement reduced the risk of confusion between the two
organizations in the public mind, but didn't specify how that would
be accomplished.
   Dallas-based MADD was formed to fight drunken driving. The
lawsuit said the name was registered Sept. 6, 1983. MADD also said
it owns the rights to the slogan ``I'm a MADD Dad.''
   Mad Dads was formed in 1989 to discourage use of alcohol and
illegal drugs by young people and to prevent gang crime in the
Omaha area.

<HEAD>Private Visit by Sharon Causes Stir in Moscow</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS three grafs with details of PLO protest.

   Soviet Jews rejoiced and a Palestinian diplomat
protested Monday as Ariel Sharon, the former Israeli general and
defense minister, made an unofficial visit to Moscow.
   Sharon, now Israel's housing minister and head of a Cabinet
committee on immigration, is discussing the possibility of buying
prefabricated housing from a Soviet cooperative and sending fruit
and vegetables to Moscow in return, according to media reports.
   On Monday, Sharon made an unannounced public appearance, shaking
hands and talking with Jews waiting in line for visa applications
outside the Dutch Embassy. Israel maintains an interests section in
the embassy, its only permanent diplomatic representation in Moscow.
   People in the line said later they were overjoyed to meet Sharon
and receive his assurances that the Israeli government would not
abandon them.
   Sharon arrived Friday night for a week-long visit and made his
first public appearance Saturday at the city's main synagogue,
where he was warmly greeted by a surprised crowd of about 100 Jews,
witnesses said.
   There had been no advance notice in the Soviet press of his
visit to Moscow.
   Sharon told the crowd at the synagogue that Israel would build
500,000 more housing units, enough for all the Soviet Jews who
emigrate.
   Israeli officials expect a total of 150,000 Soviet Jews to
immigrate by the end of the year and say the influx does not appear
to be affected by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   According to an American newspaper reporter and others who were
present, Sharon called the current wave of emigration, which has
brought a record 80,000 Soviet Jews to Israel so far this year,
``the most important thing to happen to the Jewish people in the
past 40 years.''
   The burly, 62-year-old former general encouraged Jews to
continue to emigrate, despite a housing and job shortage in Israel,
and said they will make the country stronger.
   ``Peace depends upon the number of Jews who come to Israel,'' he
said.
   Sharon is only the second Israeli Cabinet minister to visit the
Soviet Union in recent years. The first was Science Minister and
former Defense Minister Ezer Weizman, who was in Moscow in January
and met with Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Relations between Israel and the Soviet Union have warmed since
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985. Gorbachev has
loosened emigration regulations, allowing a record number of Soviet
Jews to leave.
   There has been speculation that the two countries may restore
diplomatic relations, which the Soviet Union severed after the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
   Tass meanwhile said it had received a letter of protest from
Nabil M. Amr, the Palestine Liberation Organization's diplomatic
representative in Moscow.
   Amr's letter called Sharon ``the key figure responsible for the
massacre in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila'' in
Lebanon in 1982, according to Tass. Lebanese Christian militiamen,
allied with Israel, committed the massacre.
   Amr also blamed Sharon for ``the destruction of thousands of
Palestinian and Lebanese houses,'' Tass said.

   New episodes of ``The Simpsons'' will finally
begin Oct. 11, the Fox Broadcasting Co. announced Monday.
   The cartoon family that moved to Thursdays this summer to battle
NBC's top-rated ``The Cosby Show,'' is currently in a second round
of repeats.
   Since moving to the 8 p.m. slot dominated by Cosby, ``The
Simpsons'' have been trounced in the ratings.
   Original episodes will see Homer Simpson getting a new, male
secretary who makes a pass at his boss. Dad Simpson also will
experiment with a hair-growing tonic.
   Because of the complicated animation process, each installment
of the series takes six months to complete.
   New episodes of Fox's ``In Living Color,'' a black-produced and
directed comedy program, will begin Sept. 23 at 8 p.m.
``Married...With Children'' enters its fifth season the same night
at 9.

<HEAD>U.S. Issues Travel Advisory as Base Talks Set to Resume</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By OLIVER TEVES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Washington and Manila prepare to
resume talks on a treaty to keep U.S. military bases in the
Philippines, the U.S. government issued a travel advisory Monday
warning of increased threats to Americans.
   A Filipino lawmaker denounced the State Department advisory on
Monday, saying it was part of a plan to move the site of the talks,
expected to begin next week, from the Philippine capital to
Washington.
   An agreement to maintain the six U.S. military bases in the
Philippines is due to expire Sept. 16, 1991, and a new treaty is
required to keep them open.
   Last week, U.S. authorities at the Clark Air Base and Subic Bay
Naval Base banned non-essential travel outside the facilities
because of threats from the Communist New People's Army.
   Two U.S. airmen were killed by the rebels on the eve of the
first round of the talks last May. The rebels have warned of more
such attacks to demonstrate their opposition to the bases.
   Opponents of the bases say their presence compromises Philippine
sovereignty.
   In its travel advisory, the State Department warned of
``continuing threats to U.S. citizens in the Philippines.''
   ``These threats are heightened in the period surrounding the
Philippine-U.S. base negotitiations,'' it said.
   The U.S. Embassy estimates there are about 140,000 Americans in
the Philippines, including 40,000 affiliated with the U.S. military.
   The advisory said those at risk include Americans who are
employed by the U.S. government or private firms, those living near
U.S. military or diplomatic facilities and those who visit places
patronized by other Americans.
   The State Department noted that the U.S. government suspended
the Peace Corps program in the Philippines earlier this year
because of rebel threats. It said Americans should not travel to at
least 11 provinces in which Communist guerrilla, Moslem
secessionists or criminals are active. It also warned that the
security situation could change in major tourist destinations and
other relatively peaceful areas.
   Philippine Sen. Aquilino Pimentel said the travel advisory was
meant to show that the Philippines has falled into ``anarchy and
chaos'' to justify moving the talks outside the country.
   Pimentel said a change of venue for talks would put Filipino
negotiators under ``a lot of pressure.''
   ``Considering all these efforts to destabilize the Philippines
and the Filipino people by the U.S. itself, I do not think our
negotiators will have any chance at all to ... articulate what is
to the best of our national interest,'' Pimentel said.
   A new treaty to keep the U.S. bases open will require the
approval of two-thirds of the 23-member Senate, where there is
strong anti-base sentiment.

<HEAD>Black and White Masons Meet For First Time in Connecticut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Connecticut's two Masonic lodges,
traditionally racially segregated Christian organizations, met in
an unprecedented joint service that band leader Lionel Hampton
hailed as a blow to prejudice.
   ``This is the first time I've witnessed it, and I'm so happy to
be here,'' said Hampton, who was keynote speaker at the joint
service Sunday.
   Hampton said the meeting of black and white Masons symbolized
what the group was long meant to stand for.
   ``Brothers are supposed to work together and meet together, and
have strength and unity,'' he said. ``This is love, peace and
harmony _ breaking down prejudice and kicking it in the pants,'' he
said. ``I've finally seen it come to pass that the black and white
brothers can meet together.''
   The two lodges, one with 28,000 whites and the other with 2,000
blacks, last year became the first masons' lodges in the United
States to grant mutual recognition and certain membership
privileges to each other. Recognition allows a Mason to attend
services or participate in activities in another jurisdiction.
   The Masons are a Christian, non-denominational group with 3
million members in the United States and 6 million worldwide.
   St. John's Lodge No. 6 in Norwalk was the site of the gathering
Sunday, which brought together members of the white Grand Lodge of
Ancient Free and Accepted Masons with members of the black Prince
Hall Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons.
   Connecticut is one of only four states with a policy of joint
recognition, Mason officials said Sunday. The others are Nebraska,
Washington and Wisconsin.
   ``We got criticized for it,'' said Grand Chaplain Ervin L. Betts
of Connecticut's Grand Lodge. ``For instance, the state of
Louisiana will not recognize any of our Masons now.''
   Betts said Masonic lodges in several states are planning to
abolish racial divisions and extend recognition to one another.
   Although racially mixed lodges are virtually non-existent, Betts
said Sunday's service was a good first step in that direction.
   ``I think it's marvelous,'' he said. ``What was so beautiful
about this was that both blacks and whites helped bring this
about.''
   Hampton said the event highlighted his 52 years as a Mason.
   ``This means so much,'' he said. ``I applaud these people _ it's
so good when people like this get together. We've never had this in
Masonry before.''

   Officials decided Monday that yoga isn't so
devilish after all.
   During a special meeting Monday night that drew about 100
spectators, members of the Toccoa City Commission, the Stephens
County Commission and the county recreation board decided they
would allow yoga enthusiasts to practice their exercises in a
county recreation center.
   But in an attempt to appease those in this small northeast
Georgia town who believe yoga is a form of devil worship, the yoga
classes will won't be sponsored by the county or funded with tax
dollars.
   The move reversed a decision last week to cancel a class after
some residents complained.
   Phillip Lawrence, a local chiropractor who has led the fight
against yoga, said last week those who practice it are opening the
door to the devil.
   ``The people who are signed up for the class are just walking
into to it like cattle to a slaughter,'' he said last week. ``Half
of yoga is a branch of Eastern mysticism, and it has strong occult
influences.''

<HEAD>Hard-liner Returns From Exile to Head New Yugoslav Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A champion of hard-line communism
has returned from self-imposed exile and will probably head a newly
formed Yugoslav Communist Party, newspapers reported Monday.
   The old nationwide Yugoslav Communist Party, which had ruled
Yugoslavia since World War II, unraveled this year over deep
differences between its reformist and orthodox factions. Communists
still rule, but their power has dissipated because of defections by
reformers.
   In earlier interviews, Vlado Dapcevic, the hard-liner who
reportedly returned to Yugoslavia last week, said he had remained
faithful to Stalinist concepts of a powerful Communist Party and a
Socialist society.
   The Belgrade Borba daily said Dapcevic, who has spent much of
his life in Yugoslav jails for his pro-Soviet political views,
returned from Brussels, Belgium, on Saturday.
   Other newspaper reports said he is likely to assume the position
of president of the new Communist Party recently formed in the
southern Adriatic port of Bar.
   Most of the members of the new party are former political
prisoners who were jailed after 1948 for their pro-Soviet views.
   Dapcevic, now a Belgian citizen, opposed Yugoslavia's break with
the Soviet Union in 1948. He was jailed after attempting to defect
to the Soviets in 1949. He later fled the country.
   In 1975, Dapcevic was abducted in Romania by Yugoslav secret
agents and brought to Belgrade, where he was sentenced to life
imprisonment. However, he was released in 1988 and went to Brussels.

   A New Hampshire company is moving to buy
Rancho Rajneesh, the 64,000-acre ranch that once housed Indian guru
Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and thousands of his followers.
   Hanover Investment Corp. has paid a deposit on the purchase, the
company's attorney, William Clauson, said Monday. He refused to
reveal how much the company will pay Connecticut General Life
Insurance, which bought the ranch at a sheriff's foreclosure
auction two years ago for $4.5 million.
   Connecticut General was asking for $5 million to $6 million for
the property in Eastern Oregon and set a closing date of Jan. 10.
   A number of options are being considered for the land, including
a private minimum-security prison, Clauson said.
   The only idea that's been rejected: a religious commune.
   The commune disbanded in 1985 after the guru pleaded guilty to
federal immigration charges. Under a plea agreement, he received a
suspended 10-year sentence, paid a $400,000 fine and agreed not to
return to the United States for five years without the written
permission of the U.S. attorney general.
   He has since died in India.
   The property includes a sewage treatment plant, an electric
power substation, an airport with a paved 4,500-foot landing strip,
farm land, an 88,000-square-foot meeting hall and a six miles of
frontage on the John Day River.

<HEAD>20 Palestinians Injured in Factional Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem fundamentalists and pro-PLO activists,
allies in the struggle against Israel, have been fighting each
other in the streets of the occupied West Bank, the army and Arab
reports said Monday.
   Twenty people have been injured, hospital officials said.
   The fighting pits members of the fundamentalist Hamas movement
and rival Palestine Liberation Organization factions.
   The groups, while allied in the 34-month-old uprising against
Israeli occupation, have argued in the past over tactics and
control. But the latest outbreak of internecine warfare was among
the most violent, Arab reports said.
   The trouble in the West Bank began Friday, when a Hamas preacher
was blocked from participating in prayer services in the village of
Bala by pro-PLO activists, Arab reports and the army said.
   The following day, Hamas retaliated in the nearby town of
Tulkarem by beating up a man suspected of participating in the Bala
incident, the sources said.
   Clashes broke out in several towns and villages Sunday, pitting
Hamas against members of Fatah, the PLO's largest faction, and
other allied groups.
   In street battles Sunday in the Tulkarem refugee camp, 17
Palestinians were injured, including seven hospitalized with stab
wounds, doctors at Tulkarem hospital said. Three more Palestinians
were admitted with injuries Monday, they said.
   The army clamped a curfew on the camp Monday, the military
spokesman's office said. Army radio said a Fatah enforcement squad
that calls itself the Black Panthers was trying to negotiate a
truce.
   In 1989, there were fistfights and knifings in the West Bank
between Hamas activists, who advocate an Islamic state, and pro-PLO
factions, who traditionally have been secular in their approach.
   Hamas, one of the groups that started the uprising, has argued
for the overthrow of Israel, while the PLO factions have backed PLO
leader Yasser Arafat's call for negotiations.

   Stalled budget talks between
Bush administration officials and congressional leaders reached the
negotiators' self-imposed deadline Monday and participants began
complaining publicly about the lack of progress.
   ``I would say the talks are going nowhere fast,'' Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady declared.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., called Brady's remarks
``inappropriate and not helpful.'' Yet he conceded that work has
gone slowly, and began lessening expectations by predicting
agreement by the end of the month.
   ``While some progress has been made, there was a hope that we
would make more by this time,'' he said.
   For a fourth day, bargainers haggled in the privacy of the
officers' club of Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, 10 miles from
the capital. With little progress to report, House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the Democrats' chief negotiator, canceled
a scheduled White House meeting with President Bush.
   Late Monday, the sessions took a turn for the contentious when
Republicans rejected a new Democratic proposal, said a source
familiar with the talks.
   Democrats offered to accept $100 billion in cuts over five years
in their cherished domestic spending programs, the official said.
The first Democratic offer on those programs called for overall
increases of $41 billion.
   They also eased their demands for slashes in the Pentagon's
budget from $260 billion over five years to $200 billion. And they
said they would settle for $130 billion in new taxes and fees over
five years, rather than $200 billion.
   But the official said that Republicans labeled the offer
inadequate, a reaction that angered Democrats and caused them to
question the good faith of the Republicans, said the source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In addition to Brady's comment, on ABC's ``Good Morning
America,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said chief of
staff John Sununu had indicated there was wide disagreement on most
areas: taxes, spending cuts and the military budget.
   ``So we're still hopeful but it's looking less and less
optimistic'' for a quick agreement, Fitzwater said.
   The negotiators want to devise a package of tax increases and
spending cuts that would slice $50 billion from next year's budget
deficit and save $500 billion over five years. Next year's
shortfall will be at least $250 billion _ a record _ unless savings
are found, a level that would trigger automatic spending cuts.
   Before the talks began, bargainers said they had to shake hands
on a deal by Monday to give Congress time to enact it by the Oct. 1
start of the coming fiscal year.
   With the sessions producing little progress, participants have
begun to talk about perhaps finishing in time for Bush's scheduled
speech Tuesday night to a joint session of Congress.
   But some negotiators are beginning to fear that the talks won't
produce fruit until after Oct. 1.
   If there is no deficit-reduction plan in force by that day, the
Gramm-Rudman law will automatically pare government spending by
$100 billion. Democrats and Republicans agree that a cut of that
depth out of the $1.2 trillion federal budget would be intolerably
harsh.
   ``I'm optimistic that we'll get a deal at some point,'' Brady
said. ``I'm not optimistic that these particular talks will produce
it in time.''
   The frustration was spreading to lawmakers left behind on
Capitol Hill, some of whom began urging Bush to turn up the heat.
   ``He's reaching the point where he really needs to go over the
head of Congress to the American people, and sock it to the
Congress for not being serious about reaching an agreement,'' Sen.
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said on the Senate floor.
   Participants said fundamental disagreements remained over how
deep to cut defense and domestic programs and whose taxes should be
raised.
   Democrats want to pare at least $13 billion from the $303
billion defense budget, about $8 billion more than Republicans.
   Democrats were also trying to limit reductions in benefit
programs such as Medicare, although officials have said the two
sides were trying to complete a package that would cut those
programs by about $10 billion.
   The two sides agree that about $25 billion in new revenues is
needed, but are clashing over how to raise the money.
   Democratic proposals have focused on raising taxes for the
wealthy and imposing new energy, gasoline and alcohol levies.
   GOP tax offers have included higher rates for beer and alcohol
and reducing the federal income tax break for state and local taxes.
   One major dispute has been over the administration's insistence
that the capital gains tax rate be cut.
   Republicans say cutting the rate at which profits on the sale of
property is taxed would raise government revenues by encouraging
more transactions. But Democrats, who say the proposal would
disproportionately help the wealthy, are insisting on a tradeoff.

   Interior Minister Aryeh Deri said Monday that a
ruling body of his ultra-Orthodox Shas party will meet this week to
consider its political future, raising fears the party may bring
down the governing coalition.
   The upcoming meeting of the Council of Torah Sages is linked to
the widening Deri affair, known as Israel's ``Watergate.''
   The affair has eclipsed the Persian Gulf crisis in the Israeli
media and threatened Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing
coalition that needs Shas' support to govern.
   Shamir's coalition enjoys the backing of 62 legislators in the
120-member Knesset, or parliament, and is likely to collapse
without Shas' five lawmakers.
   Deri is under investigation for allegedly channeling public
funds through local government councils to religious insitutions
run by Shas. Deri, who was questioned by police last week, denies
these allegations.
   The case also involves wiretapping and police are investigating
reports that Deri supporters allegedly bugged the telephones of
more than 20 journalists and potential witnesses to block
prosecution.
   On Monday, Deri said Shas backers wanted the party to quit the
government and that Shas was losing control.
   ``The Council of Torah Sages, which determines what Shas does,
will meet in the next two days, since there are very strong
reactions from the public,'' Deri said on Israel Television.
   ``I receive hundreds of telephone calls at my home and office.
People don't understand. You are in the government, the police
belong to the government, and the press, all this slander campaign.
And nobody comes out and says, stop, enough. ... And they are
rebellious.''
   Deri's implicit threat was the most serious so far to Shamir's
government, installed in June after a political crisis engineered
by the center-left Labor party, now Israel's main opposition group.
   Justice Minister Dan Meridor, of Shamir's Likud bloc, said in a
speech in Jerusalem on Monday that Israel's legal system will
oppose any attempts at political interference.
   ``The legal system acts and will act without external influence,
not in order to please political personalities or
organizations...but to maintain the rule of the law. One law for
all,'' Meridor said.
   In the latest development in the Deri case, a Tel Aviv court on
Monday ordered the top aide to the minister, Zvi Yaakobson, held
for a week on suspicion that he misappropriated government funds.
   Judge Yitzhak Baraz said police had substantial suspicion that
Yaakobson, Deri's spokesman, either pocketed the money or funneled
it into religious institutions for the minister, according to the
report carried by Israel radio and armed forces radio.
   National Police spokesman Ron Ishayahu refused comment.
   Yaakobson was detained Sunday with five other Deri aides who
were released later that day. On Monday, three of the aides,
including Deri's communications adviser Yossi Shvinger, were called
back. Two of them were later released.
   Some politicians have called for Deri to step aside until the
probe is completed. Attorney General Yosef Harish could order Deri
to step down, but has said he would wait with the decision until
being briefed by investigators.
   ``At this point we don't know if the evidence points to the
guilt of the suspect ... or the innocence,'' Harish said on Israel
radio.
   Deri said he had no plans to step aside.
   ``I fully trust the judicial system,'' Deri said.

   A former state senator pleaded guilty
Monday to charges of trading his vote for cash and joined two other
former South Carolina legislators awaiting sentencing after similar
pleas.
   ``I made a very bad mistake and I'm going to have to suffer the
consequences,'' Rick Lee said after U.S. District Court Judge
Falcon B. Hawkins accepted his plea. ``We're looking for the best,
but preparing for the worst.''
   Meanwhile, court papers filed Monday by U.S. Attorney Bart
Daniel allege that state Rep. Luther Taylor took $2,800 from
lobbyist Ron Cobb in exchange for voting to uphold a computer
contract.
   A computer company Cobb worked for had won the contract from
Clemson University. Taylor sat on a panel reviewing the contract.
   Taylor hasn't been charged in connection with the computer
contract, but he has been charged with taking $4,300 from Cobb to
vote for a pari-mutuel betting bill. Taylor has pleaded innocent in
that case.
   The allegation concerning the computer contract was included in
the prosecution's court papers in response to a request by Taylor's
attorney that the government detail all the evidence it has against
him.
   Former Reps. Robert Brown and Daniel Winstead, entered guilty
pleas last week in federal court.
   The lawmakers will be sentenced in about 30 days after a
presentencing report has been completed by the U.S. Probation
Office.
   Lee faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Lee's laywer, Mike Spears, said he doubts Lee knows anything
which would help the FBI, but federal authorities have said more
indictments may follow.
   A Republican from Boiling Springs, Lee resigned his Senate seat
two weeks ago after being charged in August with violating the
Hobbs Act, a federal law banning acceptance of money or gifts in
return for votes or favors.
   Cobb, a former House member, was working undercover for the FBI
in the 16-month investigation of Statehouse corruption, code-named
``Operation Lost Trust.''
   He told legislators he was paid by the Alpha Group, investors
with headquarters in Atlanta, and made it clear he was paying cash
for votes and support.
   FBI Special Agent Michael Clemens told the court Monday that, in
early May, Rep. Robert Kohn told Lee that Cobb would pay him $1,000
for his efforts in getting the pari-mutuel betting bill voted out
of the Senate Judiciary Committee and $2,000 if it was actually
voted out.
   Lee then met with Cobb and indicated his willingness to accept
the money and on May 11, Cobb paid Lee $1,000, Clemens said.
   Lee contacted the members of the committee asking their support
for the bill. When he determined a majority would vote in favor of
it, he had the committee ``polled,'' a procedure in which the
members vote without the committee meeting as a whole.
   The committee voted the bill out May 23. The next day, Cobb and
Lee met in Cobb's office in the AT&amp;T Building in Columbia and Lee
took $2,000 from Cobb. A videotape of that meeting was played for
the court Monday.
   The pari-mutuel bill would have allowed citizens to vote on
whether to permit betting on horse and greyhound races. The bill
was never acted upon by the full Senate.
   When Lee resigned Aug. 27, he admitted taking money, but called
his role in the scandal ``minor.''
   Kohn and Taylor have pleaded innocent pending the resolution of
the charges, and Kohn has withdrawn from his re-election bid. House
Speaker Bob Sheheen has suspended both Kohn and Taylor.

<TEXT>
   Animal rights activists asked a federal judge
Monday to stop the New England Aquarium from trading a dolphin to
the Navy, alleging the aqyarium has no legal permit to possess the
mammal.
   ``Whether we get it (a stop to the trade) by agreement or
whether we get it by injunction we don't care,'' said Steven Wise,
a lawyer for the group Citizens to End Animal Suffering and
Exploitation.
   Wise, who filed the suit in U.S. District Court in Boston, said
an informal letter of agreement between the Navy and New England
Aquarium would not be a legal transaction for the dolphin. He said
the trade requires a formal permit from the National Marine
Fisheries Service.
   Aquarium spokeswoman Audrey Conley said the aquarium followed
Fisheries Services procedures and received appropriate documents
for the dolphin.
   Roddy Moscoso of the fisheries service in Washington said: ``We
consider the dolphin Rainbow to be legally residing at the
aquarium.''
   Over the weekend, the coalition and other animal rights groups
protested outside the aquarium after learning of a proposed deal to
trade a male dolphin named Rainbow to the Naval Ocean Systems
Center in San Diego, Calif., for a partly deaf female dolphin.
   The aquarium said Rainbow must be moved because it has become
too agressive to get along with other dolphins.
   John H. Prescott, the aquarium's executive director, said
Saturday that public interest led him to rethink the swap. But the
aquarium spokeswoman said Monday that no decision has been reached.
   Opposition to the trade stems from reports that the Navy trains
dolphins to kill enemy frogmen. The Navy says it trains and studies
142 marine mammals in classified underwater surveillance and
detecting and marking objects for recovery.

   Three armed men tossed gasoline bombs into a
crowded mahjong parlor early Tuesday, setting it ablaze and killing
six people, police said.
   Another 23 people suffered burn injuries, police said.
   They said the incident appeared related to growing rivalry among
Hong Kong's organized crime syndicates, the Triads.
   The men, wielding knives, burst into the club and dining hall in
the crowded Hung Hom section at 2:45 a.m., subdued a staff member
and then set the place ablaze by tossing firebombs on the floor,
police said.
   They escaped in a car, which had been waiting outside the first
floor club, one of hundreds in this British colony that features
mahjong, a Chinese game of dice and dominoes.
   The blaze spread rapidly through the wood-foundation building,
and was quickly upgraded to a three-alarm fire.
   Firefighters extinguished the fire at 4:11 a.m. Inside, police
found six bodies. Another 23 people, 19 men and four women, were
taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital for treatment.
   In all, 40 people were in the club at the time of the attack.
   The attack was the latest incident in Hong Kong's current crime
wave, fueled by guns, drugs and criminals from Communist China and
the apparently growing power of local criminal gangs.
   In the past two weeks, four gangs have robbed a total of $2
million worth of jewelry and gold. During one robbery, an innocent
bystander was killed and a 16-year-old girl taken hostage.
   According to police figures, homicide is up 42 percent so far
this year, rape has jumped 24 percent and armed robbery has more
than doubled.
   The growing crime rate is occurring against a backdrop of
anxieties about the future of this British crown colony after 1997,
when Communist China resumes control of the territory.
   China has promised to maintain Hong Kong's capitalist economic
and social system for 50 years after the takeover, but few Hong
Kong residents have faith in China's promises.
   Social workers report a marked increase in young people using
``soft drugs,'' such as marijuana and an amphetamine called
Mandrax, which are easily smuggled in from China.
   The influence of the Triads, loosely knit criminal
organizations, is also growing, possibly fueled by a sense of
helplessness among Hong Kong's poorer youth about the colony's
future.

<HEAD>Charles Rothenberg in San Quentin as Parole Violator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who tried to kill his son by
setting him on fire was returned to prison Monday after allegedly
violating terms of the parole that freed him after he served six
years, officials said.
   Charles Rothenberg was taken to the state prison at San Quentin
after he briefly eluded a parole agent assigned to watch him, said
Tipton Kindel, assistant director of the state Corrections
Department.
   Rothenberg, 50, was missing for about four hours before turning
up at a scheduled job interview in Oakland just before noon, Kindel
said.
   ``He's always been under surveillance and he knows that. It's
part of the program,'' Kindel said. ``He deliberately violated his
parole.''
   Rothenberg was convicted of attempted murder and arson for
setting his son, David, on fire in a Southern California motel room
in 1983.
   The boy, 6 at the time, was rescued by other guests at the
motel, but was badly burned over 90 percent of his body.
   Rothenberg had taken the boy from New York, where he was living
with Rothenberg's estranged wife, to Southern California for a
vacation.
   The boy was set on fire after Rothenberg's wife told him in a
telephone call that she wouldn't allow him to see his son again.
   David Rothenberg said just before his father was paroled Jan. 24
that he was frightened and kept a BB gun by his bed.
   ``I'd shoot his eye out if he ever came over. I'd blind him,''
the boy said.
   Rothenberg lived in Alameda County, across the bay from San
Francisco, since being paroled after serving six years and five
months of a 13-year sentence. He was freed early for good behavior
and put on three years' parole.
   The Board of Prison Terms will hold a hearing within 60 days on
the alleged parole violation, Kindel said.
   The terms of the parole called for Rothenberg to be watched
constantly by parole agents.

   A man shot and killed his father, sister
and two other relatives Sunday, then traded gunfire with police
before surrendering about two hours later, authorities said.
   Two deputies were wounded in the standoff.
   Thomas Wilson Sillman, 41, was booked into the Grant Parish Jail
on four counts of first-degree murder and six counts of attempted
murder, stemming from the shots fired at police.
   Grant Parish deputies were called shortly before noon by a
neighbor who heard gunshots at the home in this small central
Louisiana town where the alleged gunman lived with his parents.
   Sillman, armed with several guns, barricaded himself inside the
house and traded gunfire with authorities before surrendering about
two hours later, deputies said.
   The dead were identified as Sillman's father, Thomas H. Sillman,
80; his sister, Carolyn Lewis, 33; Mrs. Lewis' husband, James D.
Lewis Jr., 40; and Conley K. Allen, 67, the alleged gunman's uncle.
   Deputy Town Marshal Dan Fletcher of Montgomery was in stable
condition and Grant Parish Deputy John Rollins was in good
condition at Rapides General Hospital in Alexandria. Details of
their injuries were not released.

<HEAD>Unions Agree To Negotiate Concessions With N.Y. Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The unions at the New York Post agreed to talks
aimed at finding $17 million in concessions that the Post says it
needs in order to remain in business past Sept. 15.
   The unions said Sept. 7 they believed the Post needed
concessions. While they agreed in principle to negotiate, they got
the Post to agree to an outside audit of the papers books. They
also are seeking stock in the Post and at least one seat on the
board of directors.
   ``We are going to do everything possible to help the Post stay
in business,'' said George McDonald, president of the Allied
Printing Trades Council, an umbrella group for unions at the
newspaper.
   On Sept. 4, Publisher Peter S. Kalikow said that the newspaper
was running an annual deficit of $25 million to $27 million and
that he needed the unions to provide $17 million in concessions or
the paper would close.
   If the unions are satisfied with an audit by Peat Marwick Main &amp;
Co., round-the-clock negotiations could begin. The cuts would be
effective for the life of the current contracts, which expire March
30.
   The Newspaper Guild, which represents 337 reporters, editors,
sales and clerical workers, was asked to take a 30 percent pay cut,
union members said. Their work week also would be increased 2{
hours and payments for health care increased 5 percent, members
said.
   Michael Alvino, president of the drivers union, said the Post
asked his group for personnel cuts and reduced overtime totaling $8
million.

<HEAD>Daily News Unions Campaign To Dry Up Advertising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News' unions began a long-threatened
drive to gain leverage at the bargaining table by asking
advertisers to boycott the newspaper.
   George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades
Council, announced Sept. 4 that letters had been sent to hundreds
of advertisers and ad agencies asking them to stop buying space.
   McDonald said display advertisers were the first target. Later
the unions might make the same request of classified advertisers
and finally ask readers and subscribers to boycott the News'
advertisers, he said.
   The Allied is an umbrella organization of 10 unions that have
been without a contract at the News since March 30.
   The newspaper had no response to the announcement.
   The News has said it must have new agreements that give
management control of work rules and staff sizes.
   One union, the printers, opposes the boycott. And an estimated
70 to 90 of the 600 Newspaper Guild members at the News objected to
the idea as counterproductive.

<HEAD>Peoria Journal Star Completes Closes Purchase of Galesburg Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALESBURG, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Peoria Journal Star's $15 million
purchase of the Register-Mail of Galesburg and two weekly
newspapers is final after 18 months of bitter bidding wars and
lawsuits, officials said.
   The closing took place Sept. 5 in Chicago, more than a year
after a federal judge ended a bidding war and legal battle between
the Journal Star and Thomson Newspapers of Toronto.
   ``I'm very . . . gratified that the sale has gone through,''
said John McConnell, president and publisher of the Journal Star.
   He said the Register-Mail will be ``operated as an independent
entity, serving its own community as only a local newspaper can.''
   McConnell said Donald W. Cooper would assume the position of
publisher once the transfer of stock from the newspaper's parent
company, Galesburg Printing and Publishing Co., is complete. Cooper
has been general manager since July 1.
   The sale had split the family that owned the Register-Mail, a
Monday-through-Saturday afternoon publication with a circulation of
18,700.
   Three trustees _ brothers Lester T. and John Pritchard and
cousin Sally Custer Day _ owned 54 percent of the Register-Mail
stock. Lester Pritchard was president of Galesburg Printing and
Publishing and John Pritchard was publisher of the Register-Mail,
which traces its roots to 1866 and founder Omer N. Custer.
   The trustees, all descendants of Custer, announced in April 1989
they intended to sell the paper to Thomson for $14.7 million.
   John Pritchard, fired as publisher, filed a federal lawsuit to
halt the sale. He was joined in the lawsuit by the Journal Star,
which had submitted a bid for the Register-Mail.
   In his lawsuit, John Pritchard accused the other trustees of
breaching their fiduciary responsibilities by failing to consider
other offers.
   U.S. District Judge Michael Mihm issued an injunction blocking
the sale. Mihm also voided the tendering to Thomson of about 91
percent of Register-Mail stock.
   Mihm ordered the appointment of investment bankers to evaluate
new bids.
   Thomson and the Journal Star each resubmitted bids for the
Register-Mail and the weeklies Wrova Reporter and Galva News, which
serve parts of Henry and Knox counties.
   In January, the Journal Star's $15 million offer, which includes
plans to form an employee stock ownership plan, was named the
winning bid.
   The Journal Star is the fourth largest newspaper in Illinois,
with a circulation of 91,000 daily and 115,000 on Sunday. It became
an employee-owned newspaper in 1982, with workers holding 82
percent of its stock.
   Galesburg, population 35,300, is about 40 miles west of Peoria.

<HEAD>School Bills Newspaper After Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northern Arizona University billed The
Arizona Republic more than $5,500 for expenses and the time
university officials spent during a recent newspaper investigation
of the school's athletic program.
   An attorney for the Republic said the Phoenix newspaper will not
pay.
   Steve Smith, a lawyer for the university, billed the Phoenix
newspaper $160.50 for photocopies and an additional $5,388.90 for
the time of 19 employees of the school, including Smith, according
to the Republic's attorney, Dan Barr.
   University President Eugene Hughes said he asked Smith to send
the bill.
   ``I just think when we're asked to do a lot of work, somebody
should pay,'' Hughes said. ``It takes a lot of manpower,
person-power.''
   University employees spent time with reporters during the
Republic's investigation of the relationship between the athletic
department and Grand Canyon Travel Agency. The newspaper contended
in an Aug. 12 article that athletic director Tom Jurich and
department employee Rick Smith might have violated Arizona
conflict-of-interest laws by booking school trips with Grand Canyon
Travel, which they owned.
   Barr said the school has ``a legal obligation to process those
records and has the right to charge only for the copies.''
   Hughes said, ``Our attorneys have told us we can charge what it
cost us to gather those records.''
   The conflict stems from the two sides' disagreement on
interpretations of the state open records law. The debate is
whether the Republic's use of public files from the university was
for a commercial or non-commercial purpose.

<HEAD>Former Clovis Publisher Pleads Guilty to Embezzlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLOVIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Clovis News Journal publisher James Griffin
pleaded guilty to embezzlement Sept. 6 in the questioned
expenditure of more than $500,000 at the newspaper.
   Under a plea agreement, Griffin is to disclose all financial
dealings with the News Journal and attempt to repay at least
$250,000. He could be ordered to pay more if recommended by a
parole office.
   Griffin was charged with embezzling more than $20,000 from the
News Journal and its parent company, Freedom Newspapers Inc., a
second-degree felony. He has been free on a $10,000 appearance bond.
   District Judge David W. Bonem accepted Griffin's plea agreement
and said he would be sentenced after the Adult Probation and Parole
Office compiles a pre-sentence report.
   Second-degree felonies carry a penalty of nine years in prison
and a maximum fine of $10,000.
   One of Griffin's lawyers, Vern Payne of Albuquerque, said the
spirit of the agreement is that Griffin will pay based on his
ability.
   ``We cannot commit to the court that we have the ability to pay
restitution, based on the activity of taxation officials,'' Payne
said.
   The Internal Revenue Service has filed liens against Griffin and
his wife, Faunette, totaling $144,471 for unpaid personal income
taxes in 1987, 1988 and 1989.
   ``Griffin is employed driving a truck,'' Payne told the judge.
``We'll do what we can.''
   Griffin, 60, resigned March 26 after having worked at the News
Journal since 1960.

   The newsstand price of the Sunday edition of The
New York Times is going up in the metropolitan area and the price
of the daily Times is going up in the Southeast, the Times said
Sept. 10.
   The Sunday Times will cost $1.50, up from $1.25, beginning Sept.
16 at newsstands and vending machines in New York City, the suburbs
within 75 miles and all of Long Island, spokesman William Adler
said.
   It is the first price increase for the Sunday Times since
January 1985. Higher production and distribution costs prompted the
increase, Adler said.
   The newsstand price of the daily Times remains at 40 cents in
the metropolitan area.
   In the Southeast, the price for the daily national edition went
to 75 cents from 50 cents. The increase affects all areas served by
Times printing plants in Atlanta and Sarasota, Fla., Adler said.
   Elsewhere, the national edition costs 50 cents, except in the
Southwest, where it is 60 cents.

<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State District Judge Art Encinias rejected
arguments by the Albuquerque Journal and ordered the newspaper to
produce photographic negatives for parties in a lawsuit stemming
from a 1985 fatal car accident.
   Encinias said after a brief hearing Sept. 4 that the Journal's
constitutional privilege to protect its newsgathering materials
``does not outweigh the resolution of this case.''
   ``It's simply a question of who has the information,'' said
Encinias.
   He ordered the negatives of photographs taken of the car crash
to be turned over within 10 days.
   Journal lawyer Jim Dines declined to say what his next move
would be until he has spoken with the Journal's editors.
   Eleanor Barton was killed in the Nov. 12, 1985, crash on U.S.
285 just north of Santa Fe. Her husband, John Barton, sued Ford
Motor Co., alleging a vehicle defect led to the head-on collision.
   Ford and Barton both sought the pictures in hopes of pinpointing
the location of the crash and determining the relationship of the
vehicles to one another immediately after the collision, Ford
attorney Charles Peifer said.
   The parties said in court documents that they had been unable to
find any other photographs of the scene.
   Dines told Encinias the newspaper believes its photographs are
irrelevant in light of the extensive investigation conducted in the
case, including the complete disassembly of the Ford Topaz.

despite California's ``shield law'' for reporters.
   The shield law protects reporters from being held in contempt of
court, and potentially jailed, for refusing to disclose sources or
unpublished material. But a lawyer for Volkswagen of America,
seeking pictures of an auto accident from a newspaper photographer,
said journalists should be compelled to surrender evidence that is
vital to a private lawsuit.
   ``If a recalcitrant reporter who has photographs cannot be
sanctioned by contempt, the right to a fair trial is not
protected,'' attorney Michael Zuk told the court.
   He contended someone who sues or is sued in a civil case has the
same constitutional right to a fair trial as a criminal defendant.
The court ruled in May that a reporter can be required to testify,
or provide unpublished notes or other material, in a criminal case
if there is a reasonable possibility the information would help the
defendant.
   C. Michael Cooney, lawyer for the Santa Barbara News-Press,
argued that the state's voters had settled the issue when they
added the shield law to the California Constitution in 1980.
   ``Reporters are out there in communities witnessing the kind of
events that end up in courts,'' he said. That newsgathering
function is ``one that our society, the voters, have chosen to
protect'' with a shield against contempt orders, Cooney said.
   He said the exception the court recognized in May for criminal
cases should not apply to civil suits, where the constitutional
right to a fair trial, if it exists, has a lesser status than
rights against the state in criminal cases.
   The case stems from a June 1984 crash on a U.S. 101 on-ramp.
News-Press photographer Robert Ponce took pictures of the accident
scene, two of which ran in the paper; Volkswagen of America, sued
by an injured passenger, sought Ponce's unpublished photos as
evidence.
   Santa Barbara County Superior Court Judge Patrick McMahon
ordered the newspaper to release the photos, saying they showed
public events and were not confidential. The 2nd District Court of
Appeal disagreed, saying the shield law lets a reporter or
photographer withhold all unpublished material in suits between
other parties.
   In its May ruling the state Supreme Court said the shield law
applied to non-confidential material but did not say whether a
criminal defendant's ability to compel needed evidence from
journalists would also cover civil damage suits.

<HEAD>City Hall Bureau Chief Mugged on Subway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Hall bureau chief for the New York Post
was mugged in the subway, just two hours after he wrote a story on
the mayor's response to an increase in crime.
   David Seifman was robbed by two men who took $200 and a watch at
about 9 p.m. Sept. 7 in the Park Place station near City Hall, the
Daily News reported Sept. 9.
   The robbery happened two days after his news analysis critical
of Mayor David Dinkins' response to a recent wave of crime,
including the fatal subway stabbing of a Utah tourist who was
trying to defend his parents.
   Seifman had written that Dinkins' response was ``lacking on
almost every count.''
   One of the robbers applied a choke hold on Seifman while the
other took the money and watch, the News said.
   Dinkins heard about the attack and visited Seifman at the
hospital before Seifman was released.
   The attack occurred about two hours after the mayor had defended
his response to the crime wave at a news conference that Seifman
covered for the Post.

<HEAD>Solidarity Denies Newspaper's Right To Use Union Logo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leaders decided Sept. 5 to bar
Poland's biggest daily newspaper from displaying the union's logo,
further reflecting the deepening split in the labor movement's
ranks.
   The trade union's National Commission at its weekly meeting in
Gdansk voted to take away the union logo from the Gazeta Wyborcza
newspaper. A newspaper spokeswoman later said it would comply.
   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa was not present for the vote.
   Walesa in June questioned the use of the logo by Gazeta
Wyborcza, which is published by a private company. The newspaper
was the first independent daily to be published legally in Poland
after decades of Communist rule.
   The editor-in-chief, Adam Michnik, defended the daily's right to
use the logo at that time.
   Michnik, a historian and longtime adviser to Walesa, stressed in
a June 6 editorial that the daily was a direct continuation of the
union's underground press.
   Gazeta Wyborcza was founded in May 1989 as a result of the
agreements that restored Solidarity's legal status. The union was
banned by Communist authorities after the December 1981 martial law
crackdown.
   Early editions of the newspaper focused on elections to
parliament in which Solidarity scored easy victories.
   Although generally supportive of Solidarity, the daily has
ceased to be a union mouthpiece since the creation of a
non-Communist government a year ago.

<HEAD>Turkish Columnist Who Criticized Islam Is Slain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent columnist for a leftist
weekly who wrote critically about Islam was shot to death Sept. 4,
police said.
   Turan Dursun, 56, who wrote for the popular publication Yuzyil,
was slain shortly after he left his house, Police chief Hamdi
Ardali said.
   Ardali said there were no witnesses. There were no claims of
responsibility.
   Dursun's colleagues at the magazine said he had been receiving
death threats because of his columns, which criticized Islam.
   His column titled ``Religion Education'' harshly criticized
Islam and its holy book, the Koran. Dursun was a mufti, an
interpreter of Islam, by education and he was also the author of a
book titled ``This is Religion.''
   Dursun's killing was similar to the death of the daily
Hurriyet's columnist Cetin Emec in March. Emec was killed by gunmen
in front of his house. A group calling itself the Union of Turkish
Islamic Commandos claimed responsibility.
   Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey, established a secular
state in place of Islamic law more than six decades ago in this
predominantly Moslem country. Many Turks have been increasingly
concerned by the recent spread of Islamic fundamentalism.

<HEAD>Mother Seeks Special Probe of Journalist's Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>

   The mother of a murdered journalist
has asked President Ranasinghe Premadasa to order a special
inquiry, claiming a previous police investigation was improper, her
lawyer said Sept. 9.
   ``We are sure the earlier investigation was a cover-up,'' said
Batty Weerakoon, the attorney representing Manorani Saravanamuttu.
   Mrs. Saravanamuttu's son, Richard De Zoysa, was taken from his
Colombo home on Feb. 18 by six armed men in a vehicle similar to
that used by police. His body washed ashore the next day on the
beach at Moratuwa, 10 miles south of the capital. He had been shot
several times.
   Weerakoon claimed the murder was a political killing. De Zoysa,
the Colombo correspondent for the Rome-based Inter Press Service,
had written several articles about killings and alleged human
rights abuses in Sri Lanka.
   The government denied the military or the police were involved
and ordered a police investigation into the incident.
   On June 1, Mrs. Saravanamuttu, who witnessed the abduction,
submitted affidavits in a local court accusing four policemen,
including senior superintendent Ronnie Gunasinghe, of being
involved in the murder.
   But the court discontinued the case Aug. 29 after the attorney
general's counsel dropped charges, citing insufficient evidence.

<HEAD>Polish TV Chief Says Nation's Broadcasters Experiencing Growing
Pains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's broadcasters, having won some
long-sought liberties as Communist control withered away, are
experiencing growing pains as it enters the free flow of
information, the nation's chief of television and radio said.
   Polish media formerly were hampered by government controls on
the content of broadcasts. Now they contend with such problems as
angry politicians complaining they don't get enough air time,
bureaucratic obstacles to the search for information and potential
competition from other news outlets.
   ``It is normal in the school of democracy . . . we are in a
transitive period,'' Andrzej Drawicz, president of the Committee of
Polish Radio and Television, said Sept. 4.
   Drawicz, a high-ranking member of Solidarity who was jailed
during his nation's period of martial law, told a conference of
Cable News Network's international contributors in Atlanta that the
newfound freedom in his nation has been exhilarating.
   He described a news system, prior to the fall of Polish
communism, that was based on ironclad government control.
   ``The media were first of all not to shape the people's
comprehensive attitudes, not to teach how to live and how to help
living, but to provide a primitive and simplified consolidation of
the mono-party Communist rule,'' Drawicz said.
   For example, he recalled one evening in 1982 when the start of a
national news broadcast was delayed 20 minutes because officials
decided the announcer's sideburns were too long. The man was
whisked from the studio, shaved and brought back.
   The challenges are different now, he said.
   ``The leaders of the new parties watch us with mistrust,''
Drawicz said, explaining that each one wants to be on TV as often
as possible to air his views. ``They accuse us of manipulation when
they are not.''

<HEAD>Producer Says Iraqi TV Censored Warning from Jackson Interview</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iraqi officials cut from a taped TV interview
Saddam Hussein's warning to the Rev. Jesse Jackson that foreigners
hiding from Iraqi forces in Kuwait could be treated as spies, a TV
producer said.
   But Saddam made no threats of harm to them, said Ken Walker, a
former ABC News correspondent who accompanied Jackson on his
90-minute interview Aug. 31.
   The censorship wasn't discovered until later when the staff of
the syndicated ``Inside Edition'' was editing Jackson's interview,
Av Westin, executive producer of the series, said Sept. 4. Jackson
went to Baghdad as a journalist for ``Inside Edition.''
   Westin said about eight to 10 minutes was found cut.
   The interview was taped by three camera crews from state-run
Iraqi television and the tapes were given to Jackson's entourage
the day after, Walker said.
   There had been no conditions set for the interview, nor was
there any warning that censorship would occur, he said.
   The deleted portions included a ``dire threat'' by Saddam about
foreigners in Kuwait, including Americans, who have been hiding
from Iraqi forces there ever since his Aug. 2 takeover of the
country, Westin said.
   ``The dire threat was that anybody who did not turn themselves
in within 10 days would be treated as a spy,'' Westin said. ``It
was that they would be treated as spies and dealt with as spies . .
. that was eliminated from the tape.''
   Walker said the warning came in the context of Jackson's
questions about foreign women and children in Kuwait.

<HEAD>Union Plans NBC Boycott</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union at NBC said 10 of its members were laid
off because of a new contract the network put into effect last
month, so now it plans a boycott against NBC and sponsors of its
shows.
   NBC denied the accusations of the National Association of
Broadcast Employees and Technicians and characterized the
threatened boycott as an effort to harass the network.
   The skirmish was the latest since NBC's Aug. 15 implementation
of a new four-year contract that the union's members rejected
twice. They struck NBC in 1987 in a bitter walkout lasting 17 weeks.
   No strike is imminent this time because the union says it has
decided to employ what it calls ``the inside game'' _ keep its
members on the job as its lawyers fight NBC's action.
   The 10 union members being laid off work at NBC-owned WMAQ-TV in
Chicago and include Mike Cunningham, a member of the union's
negotiating committee and secretary of the union's local there,
NABET spokesman John Krieger said.
   Krieger, whose union says it represents more than 2,300 people
in NBC's 5,800-member work force, attributed the layoffs to NBC's
new contract.
   NBC spokesman Joe Rutledge said the 10 layoffs had been planned
for late last year and early this year, but were delayed ``to
assist with vacation relief needs during the summer.''
   The layoffs ``have absolutely nothing to do with the new
contract,'' he said. Asked if more layoffs are planned, he replied:
``Not to my knowledge.''
   Krieger made public an Aug. 28 letter from NABET to Lane
Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO. The letter said a boycott
against NBC is part of the union's strategy to fight the contract
that the network put into effect.
   In addition to NBC, the boycott will be against the company's
owner, General Electric Co., and sponsors who advertise on
NBC-owned television stations and NBC's more than 200 affiliated
stations, Krieger said.
   Rutledge responded that a boycott ``would certainly qualify as
harassment. It's regrettable. . . . A boycott serves no one's
interest and will gain NABET members absolutely nothing.''

<HEAD>Radio, TV Audit Finds Overcharges for Political Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surprise audit of 30 radio and TV stations
indicates most apparently were overcharging for political
advertising, a Federal Communications Commission official said
Sept. 7.
   Roy J. Stewart, chief of the FCC's mass media bureau, said that
the charges were not necessarily deliberate and that the commission
would not impose sanctions pending further investigation.
   ``I would prefer to think they (broadcasters) are not aware of
their full range of responsibilities . . . in carrying out the
law,'' Stewart said. He said no more audits were planned and no
final determinations had been made regarding any violations by
individual stations.
   Instead, the FCC will increase its efforts to educate station
executives in the intricacies of political advertising laws,
Stewart said.
   Broadcasters said they were making good-faith efforts to comply
with complicated rules.
   ``Historically, the commission has not done a good job of
educating broadcasters to the various nuances in this important
area,'' said Edward O. Fritts, president of the National
Association of Broadcasters.
   The FCC can impose sanctions ranging from a letter of admonition
to fines totaling $250,000.
   The July 16-17 audit indicated widespread overcharging at 16 of
20 TV stations and four of eight radio stations. Two other radio
stations sold no political ads during the time audited.
   Stewart would not identify any of the stations that may have
been in violation. He said they first would be given a chance to
respond to the commission's inquiries.
   The inspections were carried out in Cincinnati, Dallas-Fort
Worth, Philadelphia, Portland, Ore., and San Francisco. The
commission said the stations were chosen because of their diverse
locations and because they serve large areas.

vice president for newspapers Sept. 4. He'll run the media
company's Eastern dailies.
   Schlosberg had been responsible for circulation, advertising,
production, operations and other business functions at the Times.
The newspaper this year became the nation's largest metropolitan
daily, with a circulation of more than 1.2 million daily and 1.5
million Sunday.
   Times Mirror also announced that the duties of Donald F. Wright,
senior vice president, will be expanded to include supervision of
budget and planning processes, public policy issues and multimedia
efforts. He currently is responsible for the company's broadcast

   Advertising revenue at Times Mirror's Eastern papers has fallen
sharply this year, largely because of the weak Northeastern
economy, Times Mirror chief executive Robert F. Erburu said July

profits dropped 40 percent, to $93 million.
   Times Mirror said it was too early to say when or whether
Schlosberg will be replaced as president of the Times. He will
assume his new duties by the end of September, when he also will

   Schlosberg joined Times Mirror in 1983. He served as publisher
and chief executive of the Denver Post for four years. Then he
moved to the Times. From 1980 to 1983, he was senior vice president
of Harte-Hanks Communications and president of Harte-Hanks'

   Permitting humanitarian shipments of food to
Iraq and Kuwait may open the door to broader violations of a U.N.
trade embargo, but the leakage is likely to be small, U.S. analysts
and officials say.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed
at their Helsinki summit Sunday to allow food shipments to Iraq and
occupied Kuwait ``in humanitarian circumstances.''
   They said the United Nations, whose Security Council voted Aug.
6 to embargo all trade with Iraq because it had invaded Kuwait four
days earlier, would define the special circumstances. Shipments
would be monitored by international agencies.
   Bush, apparently worried that Sunday's announcement would be
seen as a weakening of U.S. resolve against Iraq, said, ``I hope
that nobody around the world interprets this as our view that now
there should be wholesale food shipments to Iraq.''

possible and many of the experts are still in Iraq.
   On Sunday, President Bush raised the issue of the experts with
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their summit in Helsinki. There
had been speculation the Soviet leader might agree to pull them out
quickly.
   He didn't. But he did say at a news conference that their
numbers had been reduced, from 193 to about 150, and that they
would continue to leave as their contracts expire.
   ``They are leaving Iraq and the process is moving forward, so I

   Public schools have begun teaching
religion in this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country, prompting
concern about the continued separation of church and state in
post-Communist Poland.
   In the term that began this month, the Catholic religion is
being taught two hours a week from kindergarten through high
school, replacing the former system of church-run catechism schools.
   Attendance is optional and some other religions also are
arranging classes, but the government's decision has left many
people uneasy. Non-Catholics express fears their children will
singled out and harassed by others because of their different
beliefs.
   ``Intolerance is one thing we fear,'' said Zdzislaw Slowinski, a

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said Monday he would go to Syria to coordinate anti-Iraq efforts
with President Hafez Assad, despite major differences that include
U.S. listing of Syria as a sponsor of international terrorism.
   ``We share the same goals,'' Baker said, referring to the U.S.
drive to isolate Iraqi President Saddam Hussein with a strict
economic boycott and to confront him with an international ground
and sea force.
   However, the United States considers Assad one of the more
radical Arab leaders in the Middle East, and Baker acknowledged,
``We continue to have some differences with Syria and we expect to
discuss those differences.''
   In a news conference at NATO headquarters, Baker also reported
that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the overthrown
government of Kuwait would contribute $12 billion to help pay for
the U.S. defense of the Persian Gulf and to assist nations hurt
financially by their adherence to the boycott of Iraq authorized
last month by the U.N. Security Council.

   Allowing humanitarian food aid into Iraq may
lead to enough illicit trade with the Persian Gulf nation to help
Saddam Hussein hang on longer in Kuwait, U.S. analysts Monday.
   But it also relieves Iraq's critics of the moral dilemma of
threatening innocent civilians with starvation in order to put
pressure on Saddam, they said.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed
at their summit meeting Sunday in Helsinki, Finland, that a
month-old U.N. embargo against Iraq permits food shipments ``in
humanitarian circumstances,'' especially to feed children.
   The United Nations Security Council must define ``humanitarian
circumstances,'' but in the meantime some nations are likely to act
on their own, analysts said.

<HEAD>Brazil's Ailing Arms Industry Sees Hope in Persian Gulf Crisis
^By STAN LEHMAN
^Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Times have been hard for the Brazilian
arms industry, largest in the Third World, but industry sources say
the Persian Gulf crisis may whet the international appetite for
weapons once again.
   ``The Iraqi offensive helped illustrate just how vulnerable the
Saudis are to a similar invasion, and this should help our sales in
the medium and long term,'' said a source at the Engesa tank
factory in Sao Paulo.
   ``There are also excellent sales perspectives in other Middle
Eastern nations, which in view of the current situation will want
to build up their defenses,'' he said, on condition of anonymity.
   ``It's obvious that a crisis such as the one in the Persian Gulf
could help our business.''
   Earlier this year, Engesa and Avibras, Brazil's two largest arms
manufacturers, requested protection from creditors for debts of
about $200 million.
   Both traced their financial problems to money owed by Iraq,
their biggest customer for years during its war with Iran. Arms
sales are secret, but a much-reported figure put Iraq's purchases
at $3 billion.
   The demand for weapons in the 8-year war, when Brazil's arms
industry sold to both sides, helped make it the Third World leader.
   Knowledgeable sources said Iraq, which occupied Kuwait on Aug.
2, still owes Engesa $80 million to $90 million for hundreds of
Urutu armored personnel carriers, Cascavel reconnaissance and
anti-aircraft vehicles and Jararaca troop carriers.
   A source at Avibras, who also spoke anonymously, said Iraq owed
$45 million for several Astros II computer- and radar-controlled
multiple rocket launchers delivered more than three years ago. He
said it canceled orders for $100 million worth of Astros II
launchers after they were produced.
   Other customers in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa,
the most important markets, reduced or suspended arms purchases in
the late 1980s, making matters worse for Brazilian arms makers.
   Because exports provide 90 percent of the arms industry's
revenue, it went from high profitability to insolvency in a few
years.
   Industry experts predict weapons sales will pick up when the
Persian Gulf crisis ends, as Middle Eastern countries seek to
bolster their military strength.
   Engesa is negotiating to sell Saudi Arabia the 42-ton Osorio
battle tank, hoping to obtain a $2.2 billion order for 320 of them.
   The Avibras source described his company's expectations as
``moderate,'' but added: ``We would imagine that the countries of
the region, especially Saudi Arabia, will want to improve their
defenses in the near future, and . . . the Astros II would be
ideal.''
   He said Avibras was seeking other buyers for the systems
originally destined for Iraq.
   Rene Dreifuss of the Fluminense Federal University in Rio de
Janeiro, a political scientist and military analyst, said the
weapons industry should not expect a bonanza.
   ``The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has completely changed the weapon
requirements of the region's countries,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``From now on, they will want highly sophisticated
armaments Brazil does not and cannot produce.
   ``On a sophistication scale of 1 to 10, Brazilian weapons rate a
3. Our arms industry is defintely in the minor leagues.''
   Manufacturers attribute the success of Brazilian weapons in
Third World markets to their simplicity, durability and low price.
   ``After the current crisis is over, Middle Eastern countries
will want the sophistication of the F-15, F-111 and B-52 warplanes
and of the M-1 Abrams tanks,'' Dreifuss said.
   Geraldo Lesbat Cavagnari of the University of Campinas Strategic
Studies Center, said any increase in sales would be short-lived.
   He told the news magazine IstoE Senhor: ``With the end of the
Cold War and as a result of the greater understanding between the
two superpowers, the general worldwide trend is to be more
concerned with economic than with military matters.''
   Cavagnari said the weapons makers should switch to products for
civilian use. Some are doing so.
   Avibras has increased production of parabolic antennas and other
communication equipment. Engesa is making more jeeps, trucks and
tractors.
   Embraer, the government-controlled aircraft manufacturer,
produces more commuter planes than military aircraft.
   Its most sophisticated military plane is the AMX subsonic
tactical jet fighter, produced jointly with Italy's Aeritalia and
Aermacchi.
   ``The AMX is the perfect tactical support fighter for the kind
of conflict now under way in the Middle East, but so far we don't
foresee any major sales in that part of the world,'' a source at
the company said.
   Iraq, Iran and Egypt use Embraer's Tucano turboprob trainer, he
said.

<HEAD>Journey to Israel Becomes Harder for Fleeing Ethiopians</HEAD>

   Ayala Reta traveled thousands of miles to
reach the land of her biblical forefathers, but her journey has
ended with sleepless nights and frequent bouts of tears.
   ``I want my parents to be here with me,'' she said in Amharic,
her native language, eyes fixed on the concrete steps in front of
her.
   Ayala, 17, is a member of the ancient Ethiopian Jewish
community, which was isolated from world Jewry for 2,000 years. She
is one of many whose families have been divided by Israel's
often-interrupted effort to gather in the exiles.
   Lately, the journey has become even more difficult. Ethiopia's
Gondar province, where the Jews live, is torn by civil war. Their
departure is said to be obstructed by diplomatic maneuvering and
questions about their Jewishness.
   The Ethiopians feel their entry into Israeli society, always
difficult because of their primitive background, has been made
worse by Israel's need to absorb thousands of Soviet immigrants.
   Ayala lives at a girls' boarding school near Gedera, a small
town south of Tel Aviv. Social worker Ayelet Hammer said the
Ethiopian girls are frightened and disoriented by the abrupt
transfer to a society centuries removed from their villages.
   ``These girls are so alone here, so frightened their parents
won't make it,'' Ms. Hammer said. ``I have never seen so many
tears.''
   Ayala said she had not been able to sleep or concentrate on her
Hebrew lessons since receiving reports that her parents in Ethiopia
believed she was dead.
   Ms. Hammer tried to calm her and said: ``We will send them a
picture of her to convince them she still exists.''
   Several months ago, Ayala and her brother left the family in
Ethiopia and walked into neighboring Sudan after hearing they could
reach Israel from there. She flew to Israel via a third country,
which she refused to name for fear of compromising the secret route.
   ``My brother walked out with me, but never made it here from
Sudan,'' she said quietly. Ayala would not say how they were
separated.
   ``They are taught to keep all these personal things deep
inside,'' Ms. Hammer explained.
   About 15,000 Jews remain in Ethiopia. Approximately 8,000 were
flown to Israel in 1984 after going to Sudan in a secret,
U.S.-supported airlift known as Operation Moses.
   The airlift was ended after three months when leaks to the press
embarassed the Ethiopian and Sudanese governments.
   About 12,000 of those remaining have abandoned their homes and
gone to Addis Ababa, the capital, hoping to get on the direct
flights to Israel that began when the two nations resumed relations
in October.
   Only about 500 made it each month, however, and Israeli
officials announced recently that the flow had stopped altogether
in July.
   Fears for those in Addis Ababa increased as separatist rebels
advanced to within 100 miles of the capital. Israeli newspapers say
several hundred may have died of malnutrition or disease.
   Some reports say President Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia is
demanding Israeli arms as a condition for letting the Jews go, but
Israeli officials deny it. The Soviet Union, Mengistu's main ally
and arms supplier for years, recently began reducing weapons
shipments.
   Ethiopians in Israel claim Israeli officials use doubts that
some of the Ethiopians are Jewish as an excuse for slowing the
immigration.
   ``Because of all the problems here with the thousands of Soviet
Jewish immigrants, the government doesn't want more arrivals right
now,'' said Rahamim Elazar, chairman of the Public Council for
Ethiopian Affairs.
   Israeli officials say verification of applicants' Jewishness is
``standard practice'' and has not caused the halt in immigration.
   Even when children and parents are reunited, the modern pace of
Israeli society often changes relationships that existed back home.
   Ofira Taka, 20, came to Israel five years ago without her
parents and. THey finally arrived a few months ago, but she still
lives alone in a hostel for single Ethiopians.
   ``I only go to visit them once every few weeks,'' she said. ``I
couldn't live with them like we used to in Ethiopia. They don't
understand me, what I have to face in this country. They are no
help at all.''
   Ms. Taka looked around at her small room and said: ``We had a
big mud house in Ethiopia, with everyone around all the time. I
would prefer to be there now.''
   Disruption of family structures is not the only hardship.
Ethiopians settled in outlying areas suffer far more joblessness
than Israel's 10 percent unemployment rate would suggest.
   Many train to be mechanics or welders but cannot get jobs in
those fields, said Zalmon Perlmutter, head of a government-run
absorption center for Ethiopians.
   ``Most wind up working in factories as unskilled laborers, so of
course they want to live in places where there is work, in the
center of the country,'' Perlmutter said.
   An acute housing shortage caused by the influx of Soviet Jews,
which could reach 150,000 this year, has kept the Ethiopians in
outlying towns and low-income areas.
   Ethiopians say they are discriminated against in favor of the
Soviets.
   Shabtai Metuka, 28, arrived in 1983, but still lives with his

<HEAD>Bush and Gorbachev: Finding Ways to Reach Mutual Goals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Yesterday's adversaries can become today's
allies when they find that they need one another, as Washington and
Moscow do now.
   President Bush needed and got Soviet backing for the U.S.-led
effort to force Iraq's Saddam Hussein out of conquered Kuwait. He
needs Soviet cooperation for the creation of a new East-West
security system in Europe, and for arms control deals that may yet
spare some military spending and produce the elusive peace dividend.
   The latter aims mesh with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's goals,
including his urgent need to revive a collapsing Soviet economy
with Western support and, perhaps, with U.S. economic assistance.
   Sunday's summit at Helsinki served all those aims. It produced
no further steps to be taken against Iraq in case United
Nations-approved economic sanctions don't suffice. Both sides said
they were satisfied.
   Bush and Gorbachev repeated in person the demand their
governments had made before, that Iraq obey the United Nations and
withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait. That didn't alter the
position of the two powers, but dramatized it, and Brent Scowcroft,
Bush's national security adviser, said their solidarity had to be
terrible news for Saddam Hussein.
   There were points of difference.
   The Soviet Union, long the major arms supplier to Iraq, still
has military advisers there. Gorbachev said they were gradually
withdrawing and about 150 were left. Bush said he would prefer that
they all got out, but didn't regard it as a major problem.
   Gorbachev stressed the summit quest for a political solution in
the Persian Gulf; Bush said that would be best, but did not rule
out the use of force if the embargo and other measures do not work.
   Bush said that might reflect a difference with Gorbachev. But he
also said that one of the keys to their personal diplomacy is that
they don't try to hide differences, but discuss them without rancor
and concentrate on common ground.
   Bush said if this crisis had occurred 20 years ago, cooperation
with Moscow would have been impossible.
   Indeed, a large scale military move into the area by either side
would have prompted the other to war talk.
   Now Moscow has accepted the deployment, though it wanted
reassurances that it is temporary _ that U.S. forces in Saudi
Arabia and warships in the Persian Gulf are there for the crisis,
not for good. Bush told him the U.S. forces won't stay a day longer
than necessary.
   On the other side, U.S. policy for more than 40 years has been
to keep Soviet forces out of the region. Bush said that if Moscow
decided to send in troops at Saudi Arabia's invitation, it would be
fine with him. Gorbachev said he had no such plans.
   The summit emphasized _ perhaps inflated _ Gorbachev's role in
dealing with the crisis. That could help strengthen him at home,
where his government is struggling with severe economic hardship.
   Such a development would be fine with the White House. Bush
asked Gorbachev to tell him about the economic situation in the
Soviet Union and later said that he wants to help improve it.
   He said Soviet cooperation on the Middle East ``gets me inclined
to recommend as close cooperation in the economic field as
possible.''
   That sounded a little like a cash-and-carry deal, and Gorbachev
said Soviet support can't be bought for dollars, ``although we do
look forward to cooperation in this very serious time of
far-reaching changes in our economy ...''
   The summit also serves a domestic purpose for Bush, who
addressed a joint session of Congress tonight on the Middle East
crisis. The solid front with Gorbachev is both a buttress for
administration policy and a prototype for what could be a different
way of handling future international emergencies.
   For the first time since World War II, the United States and the
Soviet Union are allied in dealing with a crisis, offering a sample
of the new world order the administration has been talking about.
   ``This is a test of the durability of the new approach to
resolving world problems,'' Gorbachev said. ``...History dictates
that a lot is going to depend on whether the two countries can work
together.''
   Their World War II alliance ended when the war threat did, and
the enmity that followed shaped the Cold War generations.
   Should the new way of doing business succeed in settling this
crisis without war, and survive to be applied to the ones that
follow, the Helsinki summit really will symbolize a remodeling of
history.

   ``The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer'' is
roughly equivalent to ``Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm'' on a four-year
bender.
   If ``Twin Peaks'' the television series seemed dark, violent and
just plain confusing, don't pick up the musings of its dead
homecoming queen.
   This girl imbibed more controlled substances and indulged in
more sexual dalliances than the entire cast of a porno movie on
location at a crack house.
   Released this week by Pocket Books, ``The Secret Diary of Laura
Palmer'' is one of several marketing spinoffs (including a cassette
tape, pie and coffee) from the mind-boggling ABC series created by
eclectic film maker David Lynch and former ``Hill Street Blues''
writer Mark Frost.
   The diary actually is written by Lynch's 22-year-old daughter,
Jennifer, and is living proof that the apple does not fall far from
the tree.
   Jennifer Lynch's first novel is a twisted slice of Americana in
which nothing is quite what it seems and sex is never quite making
love.
   It is vaguely reminiscent of her father's chilling depiction of
sexual blackmail in ``Blue Velvet.''
   But Laura Palmer's diary is not cloned from David Lynch films.
Rather, it is 184 pages of ruminations about life in a fictional
Northwest lumber town as seen by its homecoming queen.
   It is written, of course, before her murder, which only further
unsettled an already unsettling place to live.
   Peaks freaks, grab a pencil. Though the book is billed as
containing definitive clues that identify Laura's killer, it's not
easy going.
   Like the TV series, which ended its first season without
disclosing the murderer, the book is crammed with red herrings,
confusing twists, oblique references and everything but a simple,
declarative sentence that states ``Laura Palmer was killed by
(whoever it was who dumped her body in that lake).''
   And talking to Jennifer Lynch about how to decipher the book is
exactly like talking to her father or Frost about the show's
reeling plot lines.
   Which means you never get a direct answer.
   Yes, says Jennifer Lynch with a smile, smoking cigarettes in her
publicist's West Hollywood office, she knows who the killer is.
   Will readers of the book?
   ``The careful reader will know the clues and who the killer
is,'' she replies.
   What about this BOB character in the book and why is every
mention of his named spelled in capital letters?
   ``That's the way it needed to be,'' she answers.
   Have we seen BOB thus far in ``Twin Peaks'' episodes?
   ``I should probably let that slide,'' she replies.
   On the subject of herself and on the inner workings of Laura
Palmer, the author is, thankfully, less enigmatic.
   Jennifer Lynch carries herself with a self-possession that
belies her age. In conversation, she refers to her father as
``David'' and in a clear, but undefensive, way patiently stresses
that she alone is responsible for the book.
   ``I had a job to do and I did it,'' she says. ``It was a tricky
situation at first. I wanted to keep my career different from his.''
   What was the directive from Lynch-Frost Productions when she sat
down to write the book?
   ``Be Laura Palmer,'' she answers. ``I had to basically become
her. Laura was a very troubled, very dark girl.''
   And while the TV series alluded to Laura's darker side,
permeated by sex, violence and drugs, there is nothing equivocal in
her diary: If it were made into a movie, ``The Secret Life of Laura
Palmer'' would carry an X rating.
   Beginning with her 12th birthday and ending days before her
death at age 16, the diary chronicles a young girl's descent into
cocaine addiction, orgies, prostitution and near insanity.
   But sex, drugs and murder clues aside, the book also manages to
capture the mindset of a teen-age girl caught in the netherworld of
puberty.
   Laura alternately worships her mother and thinks her uncool,
worries about the onset of menstruation and, with a heartfelt
conviction available only to teenagers, believes she is the world's
sole possessor of such confusing feelings.
   ``This is about some of the dreams, hopes and fears of any young
girl's life,'' says Jennifer Lynch. ``We've all been there. We've
all been 12.''
   But Lynch stresses that the book is not an autobiography,
although having David Lynch as a father did make for a somewhat
untraditional childhood.
   Her parents were divorced when she was a youngster, but she
spent much time with her father, who once had a paper route in
between making early films such as ``Eraserhead.''
   ``I used to have very few people who liked me because my father
was strange and we were poor and we lived the art life,'' Lynch
says.
   To her, hanging out on movie sets and spending most of her
childhood surrounded by adults was a completely normal upbringing.
   ``It was traditional to me because it was the only one I had,''
she says.
   Lynch makes her directorial debut this year with a feature film
titled ``Boxing Helena.'' She wrote the screenplay when she was 19.
   The story, which she calls ``an obsessive modern-day love
story,'' is about a woman whose boyfriend cuts off her arms and
legs and keeps her in a box.

<TEXT>
   One of the relatively unpublicized tragedies of
the lending institution fiasco is that some of the best young
companies in America may be getting short-changed.
   These are well-run and innovative businesses. They may have
excellent management, fine credit records, good products and a
bright future, but they can't convince their banker to give them a
loan.
   The alternative for some of them is to seek money from friends,
mortgage the house, go out of business or, short of that, lay off
their staffs and go into hibernation until banking's mean mood
passes.
   It is an odd turn of events, but its existence can be documented
in talks with small-business people and by reading the newspapers
and magazines that report on small-business matters. Sometimes
bankers offer the evidence.
   What has occurred might not glare out from any of the usual
statistics, but the anecdotal evidence is sufficient to suggest the
problem is there. And many of the companies being hurt had nothing
at all to do with it.
   The problem had its beginnings during the mid-1980s when certain
lenders, freed of some of the more onerous regulatory restraints
and eager to prove something to themselves, shoveled money at
anyone with a business plan.
   The economy was bustling, and bankers were eager to participate,
and that meant making loans, or investments. Some of those business
plans were read with less discernment than one applies to the
comics.
   As a result, a lot of bad loans were made, many lenders got into
trouble, and regulatory officials cracked down. No lender wanted to
remain constantly under the eye of supervisory officials, so they
slowed their lending.
   As economic growth ebbed and regulators cracked down, officials
of lending institutions became alarmed at their earlier ways and
vowed to mend them. They imposed a harsh discipline on themselves.
No loans beat poor loans, they said.
   A rather popular way of demonstrating the new conservatism was
to replace the chief lending officer with an individual whose one
overriding goal was to improve the loan portfolio. He or she would
be evaluated solely on that basis.
   The head of a soundly managed small company tells how it
affected him, and his experience quite likely is shared by many
others.
   His banker asked him to drop by. Having experienced an increase
in sales, he approached the bank expecting an improvement in his
credit line. He left with a smaller one. ``I know you'll
understand,'' the banker said.
   Another small-business person explains how he got caught in the
middle of the attitudinal change at another bank.
   He had purchased an existing but failing business and had saved
it with a large infusion of capital. In the process, he had also
saved the bank's loan to the company, which had been non-performing.
   At first the bank was thankful, but as negotiations proceeded
for a new loan the businessman detected a cooling of interest. It
culminated with the suggestion that ``we'd be happy if you took
your business elsewhere.''
   Many of the companies being hurt are very small, rather new and
perhaps operating on a shoestring. But small-business organizations
point out that small is how the biggest began, and that tomorrow's
giants are today's babes.
   Not all the companies being denied credit are risky
developmental types. Some are tomorrow's leaders, or they would
have been.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He was a 22-year-old college senior on his way
to Ireland to marry the farmer's daughter he had met in Germany at
the end of World War II. He discovered that one of his shipmates
was a famous playwright who had made a streetcar equally famous.
Associated Press Special Correspondent Hugh A. Mulligan recalls
that memorable voyage and his warm meeting with Tennessee Williams.

   Seven years have gone by since Broadway theaters
dimmed their marquees at the death of Tennessee Williams, but his
poetic genius burns brightly as ever along the Great White Way.
   This past season was illuminated by stunning revivals of ``Cat
On a Hot Tin Roof,'' starring Kathleen Turner, and ``Orpheus
Descending,'' with Vanessa Redgrave.
   Now ``Five O'Clock Angel,'' his letters to Maria St. Just, the
Russian emigre actress who held his quaking hand many an opening
night and whose unquenchable vitality inspired Maggie the Cat, is
stirring a kindlier look at this melancholy dreamer whose sad
descent into alcohol, drugs and what he called his ``deviant
satyriasis'' _ pathetic homosexual cruising _ led to the violent
ward and threatened his co-billing with Eugene O'Neill as America's
greatest playwright.
   Reading those touching, candid letters, I was reminded of my own
chance meeting with Tennessee Williams six months before the then
Maria Britneva mistook for an understudy the ``unassuming,
vulnerable little man'' in mismatched socks sitting alone on a sofa
at a party in John Gielgud's London house.
   I encountered him on a ship, the S.S. America, which sailed from
New York on Dec., 30, l947, bound out for Cobh, Cherbourg and
Southampton, leaving behind the greatest recorded snowstorm in the
city's history. On the day after Christmas, 25.8 inches had fallen
in 12 hours.
   I wasn't even a cub reporter then. I was a 22-year-old college
senior and ex-GI on my way to Ireland to marry a farmer's daughter
I met on the steps of a church in Hochst, Germany, just after the
war.
   The name Tennessee Williams appeared on the passenger list
slipped under the door of the steerage class cabin, deep in the
bowels of the ship, that I shared with three elderly strangers.
Only one of them, a refugee piano craftsman from Hitler's Germany
going back to hunt for a lost love in the rubble of Hamburg, had
ever heard of the playwright. He encouraged my youthful, idolatrous
whim to seek an audience with the occupant of the suite on the Boat
Deck whose ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' had opened to thunderous
applause and 20 curtain calls just three weeks before.
   On a loose-leaf page from a lecture notebook, I begged an
interview on behalf of the Marlboro College Citizen, a mimeograped
campus publication that came out whenever English majors like me at
that brand-new college in Vermont could be coaxed from the ski
slopes. The surly cabin boy who finally answered the call bell
seemed indifferent to the message entrusted to his care and even
less unimpressed with the quarter I pressed into his palm. But in
less than an hour down came an answer, inquiring ``if 2 p.m.
tomorrow would be convenient?''
   That was New Year's Eve. As the appointed hour approached, an
assistant purser dangling an enormous set of keys passed me through
the locked wooden gates, resembling rodeo corral dividers, leading
from Tourist Class through the better-lit corridors of Cabin Class
on up to the art-deco splendor of First Class. There a tiny
elevator attended by a midget in a commodore's uniform made the
final ascent to the boat deck. While I tried to review the
questions I intended to ask, my gate keeper prattled on about the
two blue-ribbon steers from the Chicago livestock fair that would
make their bow as beef Wellington at the captain's midnight gala
ushering in 1948.
   Tennessee Williams was the first celebrity I ever met, and still
lingers in memory as the kindest.
   Although snow could be seen streaming past the porthole and the
boat deck echoed with the clank of seamen scraping icicles from the
lifeboat davits, the playwright was wearing a white Palm Beach
suit, a flowered sports shirt and leather-thonged sandals over
argyle socks that matched. As we shook hands, a waiter arrived with
champagne in a silver bucket and an enormous tub of glistening
black caviar.
   In the intervening four decades, no interview subject has shown
such hospitality. Yet my host was touchingly apologetic.
   ``I hope you don't find this too pretentious,'' he said in the
soft Southern drawl that imprinted those opening words indelibly in
memory, ``but I just can't help living it up. Four years ago
tonight I was an usher at the Strand Theater, making $17 a week.''
   With deep musical laughter punctuated by a hacking cough, he
signed the bar chit and peeled off a $20 bill for the delighted
steward. ``Success is wonderful,'' he said, proffering a toast. ``I
wish you buckets of it. You are going to be a writer, aren't you,
and not an English professor?''
   His anxious tone and the sudden narrowing of those clear blue
eyes conveyed great compassion for budding authors but dark
suspicion of future academics who might degenerate into
 Fri.'s open int 58,037, up 531.

   The cabin steward arriving with fresh towels was invited to join
me in inspecting the array of bon voyage telegrams plastered on his
dresser mirror, and his ``Christmas toys,'' good luck charms
treasured from the Dec. 3 opening night party for ``A Streetcar
Named Desire.''
   ``That tiny trolley is from Marlon, and Jessica sent the
Southern belle doll,'' he said, indicating the gifts from the
show's stars, Marlon Brando and Jessica Tandy.
   The toy trolley reminded him that another streetcar named
``Cemeteries'' passed by his French Quarter apartment in New
Orleans. ``Quite appropriate,'' he said, more to himself in the
mirror than to me. Suddenly his mood became grave and melancholy.
   He asked if I had read ``The Glass Menagerie.'' I told him I had
seen it with a free ticket from the Stagedoor Canteen on an army
furlough.
   ``Then you saw the incomparable Laurette Taylor,'' he sighed,
almost on the verge of tears. ``I owe everything to her.'' He was
still mourning the death over a year ago of the alcoholic has-been
shunned for a decade by Broadway producers before bringing to
luminous life Amanda Wingdale, alias Edwina Williams, Tennessee's
dreamy, doting mother.
   Staring out the porthole, he murmured something about
``Streetcar'' being his last play, his ``swan song.'' This didn't
seem to make much sense, because I had read about another play,
``Summer and Smoke,'' trying out at a theater-in-the-round in
Dallas.
   Many years later Gore Vidal, who became his friend on that
European trip, told me Williams was convinced then, against all
medical evidence, that he was dying of pancreatic cancer.
   Seven chiming bells in the passageway, signifying 3:30, abruptly
dispelled his despondency.
   Soon he was laughing again and stroking his mustache at what
even then must have been the sine qua non query of all Williams
interviews: How did someone born in Columbus, Miss., raised in St.
Louis and in love ever after with New Orleans, come to be called
Tennessee?
   As he has explained so many times since, he was ``merely
indulging the old Southern weakness for going out on a limb of the
family tree.'' Grandsires a couple of greats back on his father's
side had been chancellor of the territory that became Tennessee and
the state's first senator and governor.
   Next morning the mood of the North Atlantic changed just as
abruptly. Soft Grandma Moses snowflakes gave way to churning seas,
flying spume beaded with ice and an eerie keening wind that made
doors leading to the decks almost impossible to push open.
   Even on the calmest sea, the 33,500-ton S.S. America rolled
relentlessly. No wonder in her wartime interlude as the troop
transport West Point she had been chosen for ``Operation Seasick,''
a controlled test of a new maritime palliative called Dramamine.
   Now the piano in the lounge had to be lashed down, and
``fiddles'' _ little wooden guard rails _ were raised on the tables
in the nearly deserted dining salons to keep crockery and glassware
from careening to bits.
   To escape the retching sounds and odors of my stricken mates in
that airless inside cabin, I set about exploring the ship. I
lurched and grabbed my way down endless staircases, past the engine
room and the coiled anchor chain, to the swimming pool. The only
one in the water, which rose and fell like a giant indoor wave, was
Tennessee Williams. Doing sit-ups beside the pool were several
young men whose sweat shirts identified them as members of the U.S.
bobsled team, keeping in shape for the Winter Olympics at St.
Moritz.
   Waving me over, the playwright climbed out, toweled off and
groped through the pocket of his paisley robe for an envelope. It
was an invitation for the following evening to his ``delayed New
Year's Party,'' which had to be delayed again because of the storm.
   When the gale finally subsided, my uniformed gatekeeper with the
bandolier of keys escorted me up to the First Class suite. Only a
few guests, including the captain and the ship's doctor, who looked
a bit queasy, gathered around the punch bowl. I remember a very
pretty French girl whose father was a well-known Paris publisher
and some members of a U.S. trade delegation who weren't sure who
was our host. The Olympics were represented by Gus Lussi, the
coach, and George Button, the father of figure skater Dick Button,
who had caught the Queen Mary and would go on to win a gold medal
at St. Moritz.
   Also there was a coquettish, aging actress in peroxide bangs who
threatened to audition there and then for the role of Blanche
DuBois.
   For once the shipboard conversation consisted of more than
blizzard horror stories. There was much speculation about Henry
Wallace's announced Third Party bid for the presidency, which had
just caught up with the ship's newspaper. Williams, who professed
little interest in politics, spent most of the time handing around
canapes and topping off drinks. Somehow he reminded me then of Jay
Gatsby: quite the loneliest person at his own party.
   The last time I saw him, dawn was stage-lighting the green
bluffs and gray storage sheds of Cork Harbor. Seagulls were
screaming around our twin smokestacks and the carillon of St.
Colman's Cathedral was summoning the faithful to early Mass.
Descending the gangplank to the tender taking departing passengers
to the customs wharf, I heard a voice drawl down from the boat deck:
   ``Blessings on your Irish bride.''
   Tennessee Williams was alone at the rail, wearing the ``good
luck topcoat'' he had bought on the strength of favorable notices
for Streetcar's Philadelphia tryout.

   NEW YORK (AP) _ Tennessee Williams loved the ocean and he loved
ships.
   He first sailed for Europe at age 17 on the Homeric with his
grandfather, Rev. Walter Edwin Dakin, who led a tour group from his
Episcopal parish in Clarksdale, Miss.
   Young Thomas Lanier Williams, not yet known as Tennessee, lost
his wallet and $160 to a pickpocket on the Eiffel Tower,
accompanied the reverend gentleman to the Follies Bergere and was
``thrilled by the gothic grandeur'' of Cologne's cathedral, which
he first viewed from a steamer on the Rhine.
   Beginning with a stormy crossing on the S.S. America as the year
1947 ended, Williams sailed for Europe almost every year and
sometimes crossed the Pacific on ships to Bangkok or Singapore. He
was a passenger on the Queen Mary, Ile de France, Liberte, Andrea
Doria, Queen Elizabeth, United States, President Cleveland, the
QE2, the Oronsay and the Vulcania, which he said was his favorite
ship.
   To him, leisurely ocean crossings were essential to ``the
freedom of a writer,'' which he defined in his ``Memoirs'' as:
   ``The freedom to stop when you please, to go where and when you
please. It means to be a voyager here and there: one who flees many
hotels, sad and happy, without obstruction and without much
regret.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He's one of the nation's top physicists, a
white-haired genius who won the Nobel Prize for his work with
subatomic particles. Now Leon Lederman is back in the classroom,
teaching students who have no desire to pursue science as a
profession. Why? It's vital that ordinary citizens understand
science, he says, because scientific developments are shaping the
world.

   In the class they call Physics for Poets, the
professor has just finished explaining nuclear fusion.
   A hand shoots up. ``Can you describe it without using numbers?''
the student asks.
   That's the kind of question Nobel Prize-winner Leon Lederman
gets frequently these days, since he began teaching a physics
course designed for liberal arts majors.
   And he loves it.
   Here's the man who shared a Nobel Prize in physics two years ago
for his work with subatomic particles, a man whose previous job
gave him the power to choose which experiments would be carried out
on the world's most powerful atom-smashing machine.
   A man who helped find a quark.
   Now, the 68-year-old physicist is lecturing students more
comfortable with quatrains than quarks and who probably never heard
of him until they got to the University of Chicago.
   Lederman asked for the job. He has a passion for teaching.
   ``I think the progress of civilization is very much dependent on
increasing the literacy of the general public,'' Lederman says.
``This is a democracy. We have votes.''
   President Bush set a goal in his State of the Union address this
year of making U.S. students first in the world in math and science
by the year 2000.
   But the most recent international ranking, in 1988, found U.S.
high school seniors ninth out of 13 countries in physics, 11th in
chemistry and last in biology, according to the National Center for
Education Statistics.
   And the most recent Science Report Card produced for Congress,
released in 1988, showed that just 7 percent of 17-year-olds had
the knowledge and skills to perform well in college-level science
courses. More than half were deemed to have too little scientific
knowledge to participate in the nation's civic affairs.
   Lederman is attacking that record. When he joined the University
of Chicago faculty, he specifically asked to teach Physics for
Poets.
   Among undergraduates, Lederman is viewed as something of a hero
and something of a curiosity.
   ``You wouldn't expect a Nobel laureate to do something like
that,'' says William Wolf, a physics student.
   With a head of curly white hair, Lederman looks the part of a
college professor. But unlike some of his colleagues, he has a
sense of humor, constantly cracking jokes in his New York accent.
He says he's driven to teach as much by his need for a stage as his
will to educate.
   His successor as director of Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory, John Peoples, says Lederman is probably the only Nobel
Prize-winning physicist who could make a living as a stand-up comic.
   ``This is a very serious subject,'' Lederman says, ``but I don't
have to take myself seriously.''
   So he begins his class by clanging a shiny red bell and
punctuates his lectures with one-liners and puns _ like ``Freeze a
jolly good fellow'' in an explanation of cold fusion.
   ``He can be a little corny,'' says freshman Anne Tuttle, who
took the course to fulfill a science requirement. But even so, she
says, ``He makes physics more interesting, more appealing.''
   Lederman began his career in 1951 on the physics faculty at
Columbia University. In 1979 he took the directorship at Fermilab
in Batavia, Ill., the U.S. Department of Energy's high-energy
physics lab. There, he oversaw construction and operation of the
world's most powerful particle accelerator.
   He helped discover two of the 12 smallest subatomic particles
that comprise the Standard Model of the structure of matter _ the
beauty quark and the muon neutrino. It was the 1961 discovery of
the muon neutrino that earned Lederman and two collaborators the
Nobel Prize in 1988.
   Last year he left Fermilab to return to teaching, after deciding
that of all his accomplishments, education had been the most
important.
   Evidence of his drive to improve science education shows up well
beyond the classrooms where he lectures.
   _In Aurora, Ill., southwest of Chicago, the nation's only
three-year public, residential high school for exceptional math and
science students has graduated its first two classes. Lederman
founded the school, the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy.
   _On Saturday mornings, 100 high school students converge on
Fermilab for ``Saturday Morning Physics,'' created by Lederman his
first year there. Physicists who work at the lab volunteer their
weekend mornings to teach gifted Illinois teen-agers. Saturday
Morning Physics was the first of about 20 programs for students and
teachers now running at Fermilab _ all attributable to Lederman's
initiative. The programs will occupy a new $1 million building
funded by the Department of Energy.

   _In Chicago this summer, a multimillion-dollar academy opened
for the city's 15,000 teachers to improve science and math
education in the public school system. Lederman chaired the
steering committee and envisions it as the first of 25 such schools
around the country. It will hold its first class for teachers on
Oct. 15.
   ``We don't have enough scientists like him,'' says U.S.
Secretary of Energy James D. Watkins, who has named Lederman to his
new, 28-member Secretary of Energy Advisory Board. Watkins calls it
a collection of ``the brightest minds in the nation.''
   ``His mind is so superior that he can go well beyond just
science and technology,'' Watkins says. ``He can go into the whole
field of human endeavors. We all cling to him when we want to
accomplish something.''
   Lederman next plans to reform the basic undergraduate curriculum
to give more emphasis to science.
   If redefining college education seems an impossible dream,
Lederman's colleagues will tell you that's not a problem.
   ``He has this optimism to go places that other people say are
hopeless,'' says Henry Frisch, a physics professor at the
University of Chicago.
   Frisch recalls Lederman's moxie at a meeting several months ago
of presidents of universities sponsoring the teachers' academy.
   ``He said, `We don't have a building, we don't have a director,
we don't have money, and we're going to open Sept. 1,''' Frisch
said. ``Any reasonable person would say, `No way.'''
   Said Lederman: ``It's very optimistic, but why not? Until you
fail, you're a success.''
   Leon Max Lederman was the second son of immigrants from Odessa
and Kiev who ``revered education but didn't have any of their own.''
   He grew up in Manhattan and the Bronx and entered City College
of New York, a school that in the 1930s and '40s was, in Lederman's
words, ``converting first-generation, second-generation immigrant
students into the American dream.''
   His interest in science grew out of watching his older brother
experiment in the basement with chemistry, carpentry and
``electrical things that sparked and made zaps.''
   At City College and as a graduate student at Columbia University
under the GI Bill, he gravitated to the physics students.
   ``There were many very bright guys, and I liked the way they
talked, and I liked the way they thought about things,'' he says.
   In Physics for Poets, Lederman faces a different kind of
student, a student whom he watches ``glaze over'' when he begins
working equations.
   Lederman responds with comedy. During one lecture, he showed a
cartoon by Gary Larson picturing a student who asks his teacher,
``May I be excused? My brain is full.''
   He provides his students with lecture notes illustrated with
stick figures and cartoons. In one set, a diagram of a proton
colliding with a lithium atom is illustrated with a Batman-like
burst captioned, ``POW!'' ``ouch!'' ``smash!''
   ``His attitude is pretty confident that we'll like physics,''
says freshman Naomi Swinton, whose interests lie in urban
anthropology. ``His attitude is everybody can learn physics and
everybody should because there's so much happening.''
   When composing his course outline, Lederman asks himself, ``What
do I want them to remember 10 years from now when they're
congressmen or TV anchorpersons or newspaper journalists?''
   Lederman says it's vital for citizens to understand science
because scientific developments are shaping the world.
   ``Look at this political wave sweeping Europe,'' he says in an
interview. ``It comes from communications _ it comes from the fact
that a citizens' protest in Outer Mongolia is read about in a
village in the Amazon. It's the result of communications, which
comes from quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics invented the
transistor. And that changes politics.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Bill Huggins, born in London, is a photographer
and picture editor who retired from The Associated Press earlier
this year. He was just starting to work when the German blitz on
London began 50 years ago. Here are his recollections of those
terrible days in a city under siege.

   In 1938, in case war came, we were issued gas
masks. Air-raid shelters were dug in the London parks.
   In 1939, war came. In 1940, the bombing began.
   We were never gassed but bombs fell all over London in the blitz
of 1940-41, and in our streets in Forest Gate. That's part of the
East End that got the worst of the bombing because the docks along
the Thames River in that district were vital to the country's
survival.
   After a night of bombing, we went to work through streets where
houses, shops and offices had been reduced to rubble overnight.
   The ruins were still smoking. The people who had lived and
worked in the buildings were searching for anything that could be
saved. The streets were crisscrossed with firemen's hoses.
   I had just left school at 14 and was a messenger boy with
Barratt's photo press agency, delivering pictures to all the
newspapers in Fleet Street.
   At first, it had been a peaceful war. Our photos of the British
army in France showed the soldiers doing nothing, apart from
digging holes.
   In April 1940, the Germans invaded Denmark and Norway and in May
they overran Holland, Belgium and France. The German air force
started to attack us and the air fighting in the Battle of Britain
took place over our heads.
   We went to an air-raid shelter near the office two or three
times. But we soon began ignoring the warning sirens and carried on
work as usual. People get used to things and it was exciting to
look up at the trails in the sky and try to identify ``ours'' and
``theirs.''
   The docks were first bombed on a Saturday afternoon, Sept. 7. I
stood in our garden and saw a mass of black smoke to the south. By
the time it got dark, the sky was red with the glow of the fires, a
fantastic sight.
   In October and for the next six months in the winter of 1940-41,
the bombers came almost every night.
   So many men were away in the military that anyone from about the
age of 14 could be called on for duty as fire watchers. We put on
tin hats and stood in doorways and on roofs watching for
incendiaries, small bombs that started fires.
   I was outside our house when an incendiary hit the wall and
bounced into the road, showering flaming phosphorus.
   It was the only time in the war when I was really scared. I got
as far as picking up a sandbag but I felt helpless. Then a man ran
up, took it from me and threw it on the burning bomb.
   That was the nearest I came to being hurt, although bombs fell
as close to us as 60 yards and broke our windows. A cap from one of
our own anti-aircraft shells came through our roof but we weren't
hurt.
   A boy named Percy, who was a friend of mine and lived near us,
came out of his garden shelter as a bomb fell. Nothing was ever
found of him. All of his family died in the shelter.
   The City, London's financial district, was heavily bombed on
Dec. 29, 1940. The AP office, then in Tudor Street, was burned and
our agency was damaged, mainly by sparks flying off St. Bride's
Church, which was gutted.
   London burned well that night because it was low tide in the
Thames and the firemen couldn't get water.
   When I got to the office the water tanks on the roof were
leaking through the ceiling. Alfred Barratt, our boss, bellowed at
me to get a broom to ``get rid of this water.''
   I was cleaning up the water when another staffer said, ``Don't
bother with that, go out and get some tea.'' The jug we used was
the one in which we made up the photo developer.
   Everything was blacked out at night and there were no street
lights, but I found you can see in the dark better than you think.
   What impressed me, going home at night in the blitz, was the
cheerfulness of the people who slept on the subway platforms
seeking shelter from the raids.
   Thousands would go down at dusk when the Underground trains were
still running and hold sing-songs. When the blitz eased off, people
continued to sleep in the subway because it had become a kind of
club. People liked the feeling of being together.
   The blitz on London and other cities killed 40,000 people,
injured 86,000 and destroyed 2 million homes, 60 percent of them in
London. But people took it in their stride. We grew up only a few
years after World War I and as boys we used to play at Britons
against Germans. By the time the war began, we were already
conditioned to it.
   Like thousands of other families, we had a government-issued,
Anderson air-raid shelter half buried in our garden, but we didn't
like it. So my brother, George, who was still at school, and our
sister, Maisie, who was older and worked in an office, slept
together under the dining table.
   When Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, the bombing
slacked off. It resumed again in 1944 after the Allies invaded
France and the Germans began sending over flying bombs and rockets.
   I was in a church parade in 1944 in Putney in South London when
we were asked to help out at some houses hit by a flying bomb. We
formed a human chain to remove the debris and look for survivors.
Then the guy next to me passed on the crushed body of a baby.
   I can see it now.

   Judd Hirsch, best known in good-guy roles,
plays a crafty rapist in the NBC movie ``She Said No.'' He hopes
the audience doesn't get the wrong idea about the character.
   ``Oh, yeah, they cast me against type,'' says Hirsch, the star
of NBC's ``Dear John,'' and two earlier series, ``Taxi'' and
``Delvecchio.''
   In ``She Said No,'' Hirsch portrays a successful lawyer who is
accused of raping a woman, played by Veronica Hamel. He is freed
when a deadlocked jury results in a mistrial. Taking the offensive,
he files a multimillion-dollar slander suit against his accuser.
   ``I play a rapist, but he's a lawyer, he's older, he looks like
he doesn't need to do this,'' Hirsch says. ``I played him like a
nice guy because that's the way he saw himself. The American public
might find this guy lovable.
   ``People tend to view an actor as the character. I've played a
lot of nice guys in a string of parts.''
   In ``She Said No,'' Hirsch's Martin Knapek plays to the press,
the jury and the public for maximum sympathy. He casts himself as
the victim who has been falsely accused by a vindictive and
mentally ill woman. ``You'll find the real person buried beneath
all the words,'' Hirsch says.
   Lee Grant also stars as the prosecutor, who resigns to become
Hamel's defense lawyer in the second trial. John Patterson directed
from a screenplay by Michael O'Hara.
   ``This is really the woman's story,'' Hirsch says. ``It tells
how it affects her. I think what Michael wrote is how the legal
system re-rapes her. She carries the emotional burden. She worries
that people will think she's as sick as he says she is. She has a
problem with her lawyer. She has a problem with the legal system.
Evidence that would vindicate her is inadmissible.
   ``We know there are people who can get away with murder. I think
Michael was fascinated with that. The loopholes that people can
escape through. So, when I took the part I couldn't play to the
results. You can't take away his self-esteem. You have to play the
character not only as he wants other people to see him but as he
sees himself.''
   During an interview in his office, Hirsch is eating tiny slivers
of kosher pastrami at his desk. On the desk is a teapot shaped like
a taxicab. Nearby is a piano and a huge, stuffed toy African lion
in the sunlight by the window.
   Hirsch, back for a third season of ``Dear John,'' divides his
time between television, motion pictures and the stage. He won two
Emmys for ``Taxi,'' an Oscar nomination for ``Ordinary People'' and
a Tony Award for ``I'm Not Rappaport.''
   ``I don't think you'll see a lot of change in `Dear John' this
year,'' he says. ``The characters are pretty much set and will get
larger. This is not vignette or sight comedy or humor that comes
out of lifelike things. We're smack in the middle. We want to be as
funny as we can be this year. We're going to take the characters to
the limits. Kirk will get more insulting, I'll get more outraged.''
   Hirsch says comedy helps him cope with his own life.
   ``I don't think I'd be as mature if I didn't do comedy,'' he
says. ``I'll screw up terribly. I can scream and yell. Comedy
teaches you another outlook. I think how John can be silly or
hopeless and yet be invincible. He falls on his face but he always
comes out right.''
   Hirsch's movies include ``Without a Trace,'' ``Teachers,'' ``The
Goodbye People'' and ``Running on Empty.'' His plays include
``Scuba Duba,'' ``Barefoot in the Park,'' ``Chapter Two,'' ``Hot'l
Baltimore'' and ``Knock Knock.''
   He made his television debut at the age of 40 in ``The Law'' in
1974, portraying a public defender. An attempt was made to turn it
into a series, but it didn't work.
   Two years later, he was detective Dominick Delvecchio in
``Delvecchio.'' That lasted only a year, and in 1978 he did
``Taxi.'' He also starred in a short-lived series, ``Detective in
the House.''
   Through it all, Hirsch has developed a philosophy about an
actor's odyssey from job to job.
   ``A friend once told me I was a successful failure,'' he says.
``He said, `You're negatively inspired.' I know more what I don't
want to do than what I do want to do. There's too much pride in
this country. People don't know how to accept failure. When they do
fail they have to lie about it.''

   ``The Vegetarians of Love'' (Atlantic) _ Bob Geldof
   
   Despite a more admirable second try, Americans are still more
likely to admire Bob Geldof for his philanthropy than his music.
   Geldof, whose role as the leader of the Irish band Boomtown Rats
during the punk explosion was overshadowed by his work putting
together the Live Aid concerts for famine relief, is attempting to
recover from ``Deep in the Heart of Nowhere.'' That unfortunately
named 1986 album was a stylistic and commercial failure.
   Geldof was propped up by superstar guests on ``Nowhere'' and he
sounds much more comfortable fronting an eight-piece band on ``The
Vegetarians of Love.'' The sound is strikingly new, also. For the
first time, Geldof's Irish heritage shows in his music, which is
driven by instruments like the accordion, penny whistles and a
ukelele.
   There's a certain low-key charm to it all. Geldof's world-weary,
almost defeated sound is perfect for the tale of lost love in ``A
Gospel Song'' and his reaching out on ``Love or Something.''
   ``Love is like your clothes,'' he sings on the latter song,
co-written by Dave Stewart. ``It's only useful while it lasts.''
   Geldof's not a very distinctive writer, but he adeptly weaves
stories. Even his uneventful date on ``No Small Wonder'' comes
alive.
   Two things will prevent this album from significantly expanding
Geldof's audience. For one, it's relentlessly depressing, from the
ugly cover to the last song, ``The End of the World.'' He builds up
little sympathy for the audience to wallow with him.
   Second, Geldof can't sing. Never could, really, and it's
probably why his music is so little known here. If anything, his
voice is getting worse, lowering into a growl that often sounds
like Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits. Unfortunately, he can't play
guitar like Knopfler.
   Musically, Sir Bob is destined to remain a footnote.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Comeback? Bruce Dern Says He's Never Left</HEAD>

   To the critics' trumpet call that ``Bruce
Dern is back!'' Dern himself replies in his reedy voice, ``Where've
I been?''
   The 54-year-old actor has been gratefully reading the reviews
for ``After Dark, My Sweet,'' a hard-edged thriller based on a
novel by the long-neglected pulp writer Jim Thompson.
   ``A guy in Vanity Fair gave me glowing remarks, but in the
middle of it he said, `Mr. Dern has been absent from the mainstream
movie scene for over a decade.'
   ``That almost paralyzed me,'' Dern said. ``I just couldn't
believe it. I did almost a movie a year for the last 10 years. `The
`Burbs' may not have worked on the level everyone wanted it to, but
it was fun. `On the Edge,' `That Championship Season' _ those are
not lightweight experiences.''
   Such comments are minor annoyances.
   ``The nice thing about this film is that it's not an unsimilar
venture to what got me going 20 years ago at BBS, a small company
that made million-dollar films (`Easy Rider,' `Five Easy Pieces,'
`Drive, He Said'). Now Avenue is another small company that makes
the 1990 million-dollar film, which is now a $5 million film. Last
year it was `Drugstore Cowboy,' this year it's `After Dark, My
Sweet,' '' he said.
   The film casts Dern as a scruffy ex-cop adrift in the California
desert. A boozy widow (Rachel Ward) introduces him to a former
boxer and mental patient (Jason Patric) who is conned by Dern into
kidnaping the son of a rich Palm Springs family.
   ``One of the things that people seem to be appreciating,'' Dern
observed, ``is that I'm not too far from the well. Uncle Bud has a
lot of sleaze on him, a lot of little moves on him.
   ``If there is a `Bruce Dern role,' this might be the ultimate.
He's not overtly savage, not an overt bad man. But he's lurking in
the area. I'd definitely ask for his driver's license right away if
I saw him.''
   How did Dern get this way? He appears to be an upright citizen;
his only addiction seems to be running, which he does for 15 miles,
day in, day out.
   ``I began in television as an actor who worked,'' he said by way
of explanation. ``I didn't have a strong, individual, leading-man
persona. The jobs I took in order to maintain any semblance of a
career were roles in this (villainous) area.
   ``When you're introduced into the movie business, they remember
you in the first strong images they have of you. The images of me
were always as bad guys in television shows or movies.''
   And what bad guys! He was the man who shot John Wayne in ``The
Cowboys,'' the crazy who attacked the Super Bowl in a blimp in
``Black Sunday,'' Jane Fonda's war-crazed husband in ``Coming
Home,'' the polo-playing cad in ``The Great Gatsby.''
   Dern is quick to cite some of his non-villainous movies: ``They
Shoot Horses, Don't They?'' ``Smile,'' ``Middle Age Crazy.''
   ``But I don't fight (type-casting) anymore,'' he sighed.
   Dern grew up a rebel in a distinguished Illinois family; his
father was statesman Adlai Stevenson's law partner, a grandfather
was Secretary of War under Franklin Roosevelt, a great-uncle was
the poet Archibald MacLeish. An exclusive prep school failed to
calm his wild spirit, nor did the University of Pennsylvania where
he was expelled from the track team for refusing to shave sideburns
grown for a college play.
   His studies at the Actors Studio brought Dern to the attention
of Elia Kazan, who cast him in the play ``Sweet Bird of Youth'' and
the movie ``Wild River.'' In Hollywood, Dern found his first steady
work as Jack Lord's sidekick in the TV series ``Stony Burke.''
   Dern is doubly celebrating these days, for his own success in
``After Dark, My Sweet,'' and daughter Laura's in ``Wild at Heart.''
   ``It's amazing,'' he said with fatherly pride. ``You have a
daughter who suddenly explodes on the scene even though she's been
around for 10 years. It appears she just arrived in June.
   ``She's what I call a `townie.' Even though she grew up in the
Valley instead of Beverly Hills or Hollywood, all of the kids who
grew up here are townies,'' he said. ``Most of the actors in my
generation didn't come from L.A.; they came from other lands. Laura
and her generation were around (films) all their lives.
   ``What's surprising to me is the magnitude of stardom they
achieve at such an early age. And the ability they have to handle
it, the kind of professionalism that Laura and Jason Patric and
Nicolas Cage have. These kids have a whole persona, they can do
this, they can do that. Nothing fazes them. It was all kind of
flustering and flattering when we started out. It took us well into
our forties before we got any kind of recognition that they get
now.''
   Does he give Laura any career advice? It's not necessary, says
Dern.
   ``She knows it's a marathon. She got in knowing that in the
marathon the race doesn't start until you've done 16 miles. It's
what you do with the last 10 that counts.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Europeans Discover American Impressionism</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUGANO, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>

   His first encounter with
impressionism came as a culture shock for Julian Alden Weir.
   He had been in a ``chamber of horrors,'' he wrote his family in
Connecticut after visiting a show of French impressionists in 1877.
   Weir was only a late convert to the movement that left a deep
impact on American art, as is demonstrated in a new exhibition
attracting rave reviews and fascinating European and American
crowds.
   ``American Impressionism,'' on view at the lakeside Villa
Favorita gallery, is billed as the most important show of its kind
ever held outside the United States.
   The exhibition features 66 works by 26 artists temporarily
joining the collection of Baron Heinrich von Thyssen-Bornemisza,
the Swiss industrialist. It is one of the world's most important
private collections of masterpieces from five centuries.
   For Europeans, the new show marks a discovery. Except perhaps
for Mary Cassatt, Childe Hassam, John Singer Sargent and John
Twachtman, most of the artists whose works are on view here are
virtually unknown even to specialists in the Old World.
   Prestigious European encyclopedias make only passing reference
to the American movement that ``produced compositions of
extraordinary vitality,'' according to Baron Thyssen.
   The movement was pioneered by Cassatt, an expatriate who settled
in Paris in 1877, became a student and close friend of Edgar Degas,
and remained in France until her death. Some of her works hang in
the Louvre. Her refreshing ``Mother About to Wash Her Sleepy
Child,'' painted in 1880, is the earliest dated exhibit here.
   The works displayed in Lugano by all the other artists were done
only after 1886, described by guest curator William Gerdts as the
``crucial year for American awareness'' of the impressionist
movement.
   In that year a Paris dealer staged a large exhibit in New York
of Claude Monet, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Degas and other leading
French impressionists. ``By and large, most Americans were
oblivious to impressionism before 1886,'' Gerdts, a professor at
City University of New York, notes in the exhibition catalog.
   Gerdts says that early in the 19th century, landscape had been
recognized as the most important American pictorial theme, ``one
that embodied the natural history of a nation that had no
appreciable human past.''
   He says that this explains that it was Monet, the pure
landscapist, ``who received the greatest adulation'' among American
collectors during the next decade. The Lugano show suggests that
Monet's influence also was predominant on the American artists.
   Singer Sargent, who first met Monet as a student in 1876,
Theodore Robinson and several others whose works are on view, were
plainly under his spell.
   Scenes painted at Giverny, Monet's home, and shown here tell of
an almost steady flow there of American artists. ``Bird's Eye View
of Giverny'' recalls Robinson's repeated long stays in the French
village. Also on view are Giverny scenes by John Leslie Breck and
Dawson Dawson-Watson.
   ``The Poppy Garden'' by Massachusetts-born William Metcalf,
believed to have been one of the first Americans to visit Giverny,
makes the cover of the exhibition catalog.
   There is no record of such visits by Childe Hassam, although he
also studied in France, like most other American impressionists.
His oeuvre is represented here by 10 canvases, spanning a period of
30 years. Most of them are cityscapes, including one from his
popular ``Flag series.''
   Twachtman's shimmering winter scenes and Ferdinand Frieseke's
painting of women vie for attention as well.
   Alden Weir's renowned ``Red Bridge,'' depicting an iron span
over the Shetucket River near his Connecticut home, is presented as
a rare impressionist example of concern with work and industry.
   ``A feast for the eye,'' was how the reviewer of the influential
Neue Zuercher Zeitung summed up his feelings.
   Irene Martin, curator of Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, said it
took 18 months to organize the relatively small show. Works were
lent by 36 major American museums and 9 private collectors. Four
are from Baron Thyssen's own collection.
   ``I think he is really the only European collector,'' she said
in an interview with The Associated Press. Martin, an American
specialist who moved here from Dallas three years ago, says the
Lugano exhibition is unique because of its comprehensive approach,
including regional artists not even known to most Americans so far.
   ``This is the first time a show like this has happened,'' she
said, explaining that exhibitions in the United States focus on
individual artists or regions. The number of visitors has been
growing steadily since it opened last month.
   ``It is going well and I am hoping it will even get better,''
Martin said. ``We have also had already a lot of American tourists
here. And they are just thrilled.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: The Spirit of Oneness</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With his new album, ``Spirits Dancing in the
Flesh,'' Carlos Santana wanted the same feeling of ``oneness''
experienced at the finale of the Olympic games.
   ``Every four years at the Olympics, you see people from all
walks of life joining hands, dancing, laughing together, crying. I
wanted to do the kind of album to create that spirit every day,''
he said in an interview at Columbia Records, where he has been
since his first album in 1969.
   As word spreads that Santana's in the building, it seems that
every employee comes by to say hello and ask for an autograph.
   The first video, for ``Peace on Earth . . Mother Earth . . Third
Stone from the Sun,'' he says, ``shows the Earth is the womb and we
are the babies. Forget about national anthems, flags and passports
and get into one-family consciousness. That turns me on.
   ``The first part of that piece was composed by John Coltrane,
the second by me and the third by Jimi Hendrix.
   ``I met Hendrix at a concert. He mentioned about joining my
band. Musically, he knew the band was embracing something different
than show business, that he was being put into. We were just kids,
but he knew. I think he had enough of show business. He wanted to
seriously play some music.''
   Tramaine Hawkins, for whom Santana predicts big things, and
Bobby Womack sing on ``Spirits Dancing in the Flesh.'' Santana
plays guitar.
   This is the last album under his present Columbia contract and
his thoughts are full of what he wants in a new contract _ the
chance to advise the company about non-mainstream records. ``I
don't want a big juicy contract with a lot of money. I would like
to create a new branch in the company that deals with people in a
different way than the predictable.'' Only college radio is open to
experimenting with music programming, says the man of whom it has
been declared, ``He IS Latin rock.''
   ``This company needs a branch of rebels and renegades,'' he
says. ``I want to work with them. There are a lot of bands not that
predictable, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Tracy Chapman, Bonnie
Raitt, John Lee Hooker. Turn on the radio, it is very insulting. A
lot of people don't want the same formula of canned soup. They want
the real gumbo.
   ``I would like to bring my first-hand experiences with the
streets. I'm trying for music you and I can be revitalized from
spiritually. A lot of people aren't dealing with the heart. 2 Live
Crew and Madonna have to do everything controversial to sell
something. I'm a lover. My sound penetrates deeper than a surgeon's
knife because I go all the way to your subconscious.
   ``I'm not Beethoven or Mozart but my music is going to last
longer than the people who service my records. They're like
generals who make phone calls; I'm in the trenches every day. I
have more first-hand experience with people's needs than these
people. I have to deal every day to make sure nobody walks out on
my show after two hours. They stay.
   ``I see children and grandparents, hip and square, black and
white. People tell me how my music consciously or unconsciously
helped them find their own identity in this world.''
   Outspoken and never at a loss for words, Santana says that
Columbia Records would like him to repeat ``Black Magic Woman'' of
1970. ``They treat you as a legend and don't put your new records
in the stores. Every time I go on the road for the last five years,
it's been sold out. People are waiting for the new thing we're
going to play.''
   Santana found it frustrating to take ``The Healer,'' which he
composed, and the soundtrack to ``La Bamba'' to Columbia and have
them rejected. ``La Bamba'' came out on Warner Bros. and ``The
Healer'' on Chameleon Records. ``I did a jazz album with Wayne
Shorter two years ago. They haven't put it out.''
   He hasn't done music for a film since ``La Bamba.''
   ``All the scripts they send me are demeaning to women. If I
can't play music in front of my four sisters, Mom, wife and
daughters, I won't play it. Thank God I'm in a position where I
don't need to do it,'' Santana said.
   ``Musicians respect me. I have a lot of confidence and peace of
mind because of what I do and how I do it. I feel confident about
my future. Very few bands can go to Jerusalem and make Hebrews and
Palestinians dance together or play at San Quentin and see blacks,
Latinos and whites dancing together. For the duration of the
concert they forget about their hate. That's what my band does.''
   Santana is touring the United States. Next year he plans to go
to South Africa and South America. ``I promised my wife some
domestic rhythm time. The Lord gave us a daughter eight months ago.
I need to watch her grow. I've tried all my life to balance my
life. Salvador is 7, Estella 5 and Angelica Faith 8 months. I'm
very grateful.''
   Santana left Mexcio for San Francisco at 14, and has only played
in his native country twice. ``Next March I'm invited by the
president of Mexico to perform in Mexico City. I'm banned from
Mexico. All I said was they have to stop imitating the worst of
American music and get into their own thing.
   ``In 1973, they let me play for rich people in a small bullfight
ring. I wanted to play in a coliseum and have a ceiling on ticket
prices. They said I couldn't because I play rock 'n' roll. In 1988,
they let me play in a town kind of like Fresno (Calif.).
   ``Now the president says I'm an international musician and
invited me to come to Mexico through the front door, with Linda
Ronstadt and Los Lobos. If we do seven concerts, I want the money
from three to stay in San Diego and collect interest and the money
to go to a hospital in Mexico to take care of children.''

   When Robert Penn Warren died of cancer last
year, only his wife and doctor were by his side.
   His death was peaceful, at his summer home in Stratton, Vt.
There were no family feuds coming to a head, no journalists or
disciples rushing to catch the last words of the Poet Laureate, no
hysterical mobs sobbing in the streets.
   He had his admirers, but they were respectful, quietly
worshipful, like Jay Parini, a poet and novelist who lived nearby.
   At the time Warren fell ill, Parini was at work on a historical
novel about the last year of Leo Tolstoy, who attracted worldwide
attention in 1910 by running away from home and dying near a small
railroad station. The book is called ``The Last Station'' (Henry
Holt, $22.95). The story is about an aging author _ more than one
aging author.
   ``Every book has a kind of secret origin, something connected to
the author's own life,'' said Parini, a teacher at Middlebury
College whose previous works include the novel ``The Patch Boys''
and ``Town Life,'' a collection of poems.
   ``One of my attractions has always been to mentor figures, older
people in particular, people I can stake my life on. That's why I'm
interested in writers like Tolstoy and Thoreau and Warren, writers
who are ethical in some way, having a way of life I can follow,''
he said.

   In 1879, Tolstoy was 51 years old, and in the past decade had
published his two greatest novels, ``War and Peace'' and ``Anna
Karenina.'' He had a happy marriage, several children and an
enormous estate. He was one of the most celebrated writers in the
world.
   And he wanted to kill himself.
   ``I would say to myself, `Well fine, so you will be more famous
than Gogol, Pushkin, Shakespeare, Moliere,'' Tolstoy wrote of his
midlife crisis, ``more famous than all the writers in the world,
and so what?' And I had absolutely no answer.''
   Drawing on his own interpretation of Christ's teachings, the
author devoted himself to self-perfection. He called for universal
brotherhood, advocating chastity, non-violent resistance and the
abolishment of private property, and denounced the authority of
Church and State.
   His views led to police surveillance and excommunication from
the Russian Holly Synod, but also earned him a devoted, sometimes
fanatical following, with peasants and intellectuals alike shouting
his name in the streets, calling for a ``Tolstoyan'' way of life.
   ``I think Tolstoy was vividly and probably painfully aware of
the fact he was playing a role,'' Parini said.
   ``This `Mother Teresa' Tolstoy was an act. He knew in his heart
of hearts he had been sleeping with all vhese servants, that he had
this tremendously immoral history. Probably 60 years of corrupt
actual life. If people out there really knew who Tolstoy was, they
wouldn't accept him and it terrified him.''

   ``Human life in its totality advances and cannot help moving
towards the eternal ideal of perfection, only if each individual
person advances towards his own, personal and unrestricted
perfection.''

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Parini began ``The Last Station'' in 1985 after stumbling upon
the diary of Valentin Bulgakov, a Tolstoy disciple who lived at the
author's home in his final years.
   The novel is structured like a series of diaries woven together.
Tolstoy's world was torn by feuds, love affairs and the author's
own dilemma over whether he should flee his comfortable
surroundings and live among the poor.
   Chapters are rotated among the members of the household, with
family members and admirers disputing who was acting in Tolstoy's
best interests and the writer secluded in his room, expounding his
views in letters and diaries.
   ``The one thing I was amazed about Tolstoy is he never lost
himself in the swirl of this center,'' Parini said. ``You look at
his diaries and his letters. The comments he makes to people. The
message becomes even when your life is crashing around you, there's
no reason for you to crash.''
   With everyone getting in their side of the story, the author
agonized over who should have the last word. Logically, it should
have been Tolstoy, the book's moral center. But Parini had his own
ideas. He wanted the final voice to be his own.
   Parini concluded the book with an original poem. His friends
objected. What right did he have to upstage the hero of his story?
How many journalists would show up if Parini ran away from home?
His editor was so angry she deleted the poem. The writer put it
back.
   ``I thought it was important to put it before the reader that
this is fiction, and there is an author here controlling all these
voices,'' he explained. ``It's an act of ventriloquism. By putting
my voice last, it's calling attention to the fact that it is me
presenting the characters.''
   ``Maybe that was a mistake, it could have been.''

   ``That man was both of us,
   my gentle reader.
   He was fine, they say. No worse
   than you are when you leave your bed
   unmade, unfilled.''
   _ Jay Parini, ``Elegy.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Parini interviewed Warren many times during the poet's final
years. They would take long walks in the woods, go swimming, joking
about Warren's advancing years and earnestly discussing the meaning
of life. The grand laureate and his gentle admirer. Tolstoy and
Bulgakov.
   Warren's great gift was his ability to understand his own
imperfections, Parini said. In ``The Last Station,'' no one is
perfect, not Tolstoy, not his family, not the man who juggled the
voices. The novel is Parini's bridge between two great mentors, the
dying Russian begging for forgiveness as he gasped for breath, and
the high-spirited Southerner whose final poems so nearly uncovered
his own hidden story.
   ``Warren comes as close to a perfect human being as I ever
noticed. He was totally selfless, yet had a firm ego. He was able
to live a whole life with no pretension. He was able to master his
art and help people,'' Parini said.
   ``Warren's poetry came to a head in his last 10 years, when he
wrote his most magnificent work. He was going to be dead soon and
wondered what his life was all about. I think Tolstoy also wondered
what his life was all about. I think he and Warren would have had a
lot to say to each other.''

   The Happy Goodman Family was rehearsing
for ``The Dinah Shore'' TV show some 20 years ago when a lighting
technician descended from a catwalk and stood near them to hear
better.
   As the four singers belted out their famous gospel music, the
stagehand remarked, ``I haven't ever heard anything like that. I
couldn't set them lights until I came down and heard this.''
   The four members of the pioneering gospel music family can now
be heard singing together again. After 10 years of concentrating on
their individual careers, the Goodmans have reunited on an album
appropriately titled ``The Reunion.''
   A 40-city concert series is planned for 1991. Howard ``Happy''
Goodman, wife Vestal and Happy's brothers, Sam and Rusty, will be
back on stage together reaffirming their title ``the first family
of gospel music.''
   ``It's exciting, wonderful,'' 68-year-old Happy Goodman said
about the reunion and the forthcoming tour. ``We went into the
studio with more vitality and vigor than ever.''
   There has been a Goodman family in gospel music since the
mid-1940s, but the four in their best known configuration got
together in 1963.
   Few gospel music performers have been such trailblazers.
   In 1968, the Happy Goodman Family won just the second Grammy
award in gospel music. They have performed more than 3,000
concerts, including one on the White House lawn for Jimmy Carter
when he was president.
   They have sold more than 12 million records and were among the
first in spiritual music to use drums, steel guitar, bass and lead
guitar.
   Their ``Gospel Singing Jubilee'' was among the first syndicated
TV shows featuring gospel music. It aired from 1965 through 71.
   Rusty Goodman has been a prolific gospel music songwriter,
composing sacred standards such as ``I Wouldn't Take Nothing for My
Journey Now,'' ``Had It Not Been'' and ``Who Am I.''
   Happy and Vestal, who are Pentecostals, appeared regularly on
the PTL TV program in the 1980s.
   Happy, nicknamed by his mother because of his cheerfulness as a
child, looks back on his long career and summarizes his
achievements simply: ``I'm proudest that I've been singing with my
family and with my wife of 40 years, singing songs we love to do
and seeing people rejoice at our music around the country.''
   Along the way, Happy and his family were never afraid to take
chances. They added the drums, steel guitar and other instruments
when only a piano was standard practice for gospel bands.
   They began wearing tuxedos and evening gowns and they demanded a
decent salary from promoters when other acts were afraid to speak
up.
   ``Rebels? Sort of, we were,'' says 60-year-old Vestal Goodman.
``If we felt like it would make it better, we weren't afraid to try
it. I guess we were pioneers in a lot of things. We opened doors
for others to do things that were not the norm.''
   Adds the white-haired, rotund Happy, ``The main thing was our
public; the public had to like it. If the people liked it, we could
care less what our peers thought about it.
   ``We had a lot of repercussions about things, but the others
came right along and followed us.''
   In the early years of their career, the Goodmans moved to any
city that offered a radio station with a strong signal to broadcast
their gospel songs. They lived in Evansville, Ind., Swainsboro,
Ga., Asheville, N.C., and Madisonville, Ky. After living in
Charlotte, N.C., for several years, they moved to suburban
Nashville three years ago.
   There were hard times. ``We traveled in anything anybody would
sell us on credit,'' Goodman said.
   They launched their recording career by hooking up with
Nashville song producer Russell Sims, ``who would take a chance on
a three-legged horse,'' Happy says.
   The recording contract led to the Grammy in 1968, and a second
Grammy in 1978. By Happy's math, figuring the awards come 10 years
apart, they are two years overdue for their third.
   Happy and Vestal have few if any regrets about their career.
   ``Gospel music speaks to the heart and soul of people. It makes
you laugh or cry. It lifts the soul of man,'' Vestal says.
   Adds her husband, ``I've been going good for 50 years. I've
never drawn a salary or been on a payroll except for gospel music.
There's no use quitting now.''

   The nation's civilian unemployment rate hit a
two-year high of 5.6 percent last month, the government said,
reviving worries that the economy is on the brink of a recession _
if not already sliding in.
   The 0.1 percentage point rise, which followed a 0.3 percentage
point increase in July, showed widespread sluggishness. Over the
last two months, the ranks of the jobless have swelled by 550,000,
according to the report issued Friday.

   Even minor disruptions of gasoline supply
channels could cause shortages at gas pumps this winter, industry
leaders and analysts warn.
   The problem isn't just that the cutoff of Iraqi and Kuwaiti
supplies has cut the flow of crude oil. It's that replacement oil,
mainly from stepped-up Saudi Arabian production, is heavier and
contains more sulfur, making it less usable in U.S. refineries,
experts said Friday.

   Buying a home is supposed to be the American
dream. For many people, that dream has been dampened by the effects
of the savings and loan crisis, which has made victims of both
buyers and sellers. This, the second of a three-part series, ``S&amp;Ls
on Main Street,'' examines how the crisis has battered one
mid-sized city.

<TEXT>
   In many places, the savings and
loan crisis seems a far-off fury: unknown people swindling faceless
institutions in complicated ways with vague consequences.
   But in Colorado Springs, as in many cities across the country,
the consequences have undermined everyday life by exacerbating an
already depressed economy.
   Three of the six local S&amp;Ls went under this year; a surviving
thrift seeks to reassure listeners in its radio ads that ``we've
been in business over 70 years.'' Sale signs in suburban yards
proclaim ``bank-owned.'' Headlines in the real estate section
scream ``REPO!''
   Some people can't get out of their homes. Some can't get into
homes. Sellers have to swallow bigger losses because prices are
depressed by the huge inventory of government-owned homes hanging
over the market. Buyers have trouble getting mortgages because
money is tight, qualifying is harder and rules are much stricter.
   The S&amp;L crisis, says National Association of Home Builders
economist Dean Crist, is ``hitting Main Street now.''
   In the mid-1980s, Colorado Springs exploded as a high tech, high
rollin' military mecca that grew from 214,000 residents in 1980 to
about 300,000 before the energy and defense booms went bust in the
late '80s.
   Overbuilt and over-appraised, commercial and residential real
estate prices dropped through the basement. Developers simply
walked away from their debts. So did homeowners caught in the
squeeze between lost jobs and high mortgages. Their houses were
repossessed by banks, S&amp;Ls or the federal government.
   This year, three S&amp;Ls were taken over by government regulators.
Two were sold; one simply was shut down when no one offered to buy
it. And the repossessed properties settled into government hands.
   Today, government agencies estimate they are offering for sale
as many as 2,200 single-family houses in the area. That's almost
half the 4,620 single-family homes listed for sale by the Pike's
Peak Association of Realtors Multiple-Listing Service at the end of
August.
   Steve Barron, a local realtor, said the S&amp;L crisis didn't cause
the depressed market in Colorado Springs _ but it added to it.
   ``What the S&amp;Ls did was make money available for building on a
speculative basis,'' said Barron. ``They loaned money at 100
percent rather than force a down payment. All that overbuilding is
what you see now.''
   ``The S&amp;L crisis has lowered market values throughout the
city,'' said realtor Cliff Snyder.
   Barron views it as an opportunity for some people who were shut
out of the housing market because of inflated prices during the
1980s heyday.
   ``The S&amp;L collapse has created a window of opportunity for
people who couldn't buy in back in '87,'' he said. ``Houses are as
low now as they're ever going to get. This chance will never come
again.''
   But the veteran realtor acknowledges that the S&amp;L crisis,
coupled with a sluggish national economy and Colorado Springs'
overdevelopment, has changed the way he and his colleagues approach
clients.
   ``The real estate community as a whole is much more cautious
about the way they do business. When they represent the seller,
they insist on a job history and a credit report on the buyer,''
Barron said.
   ``Heck, in the 1980s, if a buyer had a pulse he qualified. Now
it's gone to the other extreme,'' he said.
   ``We're looking at a lot of retrenching. It's much tighter now,
much tougher to buy a home,'' said Charles Grayson, a banker in
Colorado Springs.
   Judy and Dave Crenshaw can testify to that. They had to go to
three different mortgage companies and deal with two government
agencies before they finally were able to buy a home here.
   ``The government has tightened their belts so extremely that it
has made it very difficult for people like us,'' said Mrs.
Crenshaw. ``We got caught in the squeeze.''
   The Crenshaws lost out on one home because an appraisal fell
more than $11,000 short of the loan they were seeking. ``That
appraisal really did us in,'' she said, with disgust. ``It was very
stressful for us.''
   Two months later, they bought a new two-story home with a full
basement for $80,000. Even that wasn't easy.
   ``It took us three or four weeks longer to get the house than we
expected, and cost us more money because of the delay,'' said Mrs.
Crenshaw, a civil service employee at the Fort Carson Army hospital.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency established to
sell properties acquired through failed S&amp;Ls, requires buyers in
Colorado Springs to spend an extra $25 for credit counseling.
   With such fierce competition in the marketplace, Barron said,
that extra fee might make the difference between selling an RTC
home and one just like it down the block, offered by a private
buyer and financed by a mortgage lender who doesn't charge for
advice.
   ``We're talking about buyers without a lot of disposable
income,'' said Barron. ``Why should they have to pay $25 to RTC for
something they can get free someplace else?''
   Barron will not take his buyers to any S&amp;L for financial
assistance. Too unstable, too many hassles, too risky, he said.
   ``Why add to the trauma and stress with a technically
incompetent or unstable lender? It's a question of confidence. Will
they still be there next week?'' said Barron. ``I don't know
anybody in my office using a savings and loan regularly today.''
   Kerry Wanner concurs.
   ``Word is spreading among brokers and agents,'' said Wanner, a
broker. ``We're bottom-line people. When you go to an S&amp;L and you
can't get the job done, you don't go there anymore.''

   English tea is served under ceilings
decorated with gold leaf. Marble bathrooms have speakers for
television sound. A pool is lined with mother-of-pearl tile.
Five-foot-tall rare porcelain vases stand guard at the entrance to
a French restaurant. Employees stand in hallways just to answer any
questions that might happen by.
   To some, the Phoenician resort epitomizes excellence. To others,
it is a monument to excess and extravagance paid for by the
now-insolvent Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.
   But for anyone who spends a night there, it's hard to believe
this $275 million desert oasis actually is a government-owned and
operated property.
   ``If the government's running it, they're doing a wonderful job.
I'd say this is one of their more successful ventures,'' Frederick
Shaw, a Westfield, N.J., physician, said with a chuckle. ``It's the
nicest resort I've ever stayed in.''
   ``Club Fed,'' as it is called locally, was seized by FBI agents
last November after federal regulators took over Lincoln from
Charles Keating, the Phoenix developer blamed for one of the
costliest of all S&amp;L failures.
   As if the Phoenician's ownership wasn't troublesome enough,
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait created some figurative ripples through
the seven swimming pools here, too.
   Lincoln Savings owned 55 percent of the resort _ the share now
in the hands of the federal Resolution Trust Corp. The London-based
Kuwait Investment Office owns the remaining 45 percent.
   ``They assured us the investment is secure,'' Phoenician
spokeswoman Sally Cooper said of the Kuwaitis.
   The U.S. government continues to run the palm-filled oasis,
hiring an Austrian hotelier to manage the 130-acre resort until a
buyer can be found.
   No attempt has been made to sell the hotel because of pending
litigation, and the Kuwaitis have the first right of refusal, RTC
spokesman Kevin Shields said.
   The Phoenician is one of the best-known of all the thousands of
properties now in the hands of the federal government, acquired
through failed S&amp;Ls.
   It became both a symbol of the S&amp;L excess, and a battleground
for Keating, who claims S&amp;L regulators didn't understand his
business and conspired to ruin his deals.
   Regulators, for their part, claim Keating looted Lincoln
Savings, using it as his own piggy bank to finance a lavish
lifestyle for his family and build speculative ``white elephant''
projects like the resort, which they say has lost millions since
its October 1988 opening.
   ``It's very opulent and extravagant,'' Shields said. ``This is
not something S&amp;Ls should go around building.''
   So heated is the feud between Keating and regulators that when
the government ousted Keating's management of the Phoenician, FBI
agents confiscated documents and changed the locks on the doors.
   Phoenician management now says the resort is breaking even on a
cash-flow basis. But that's not a true picture, the RTC says,
because the Phoenician's balance sheet carries no debt _ Lincoln
footed the $275 million bill for building the resort.
   ``The question is, can it really make a profit?'' Shields said.
``What price will we be able to sell it in order for the buyer to
make it profitable?''
   While all the wrangling has gone on, few if any reservations
have been canceled because of the mess.
   ``Really, all of this has not had any adverse effect. If
anything, curiosity was piqued,'' said Ms. Cooper.
   Dennis Beljan was curious. He and his wife came from nearby
Mesa, Ariz., for a golf holiday because ``I knew it was supposed to
be a super property.''
   ``It exceeds some of the higher quality resorts in the area,''
Beljan said. ``You don't feel any government presence at all.''

<TEXT>
   The Ladies Home Journal plans to publish a
Russian language supplement that will be inserted in 10,000 copies
of its November issue for distribution in the Soviet Union,
magazine executives said.
   Myrna Blyth, publishing director and editor in chief, said the
one-time special will make the Meredith Corp. publication the first
American women's magazine with a Russian-language section available
in the Soviet Union.
   The 32-page section, announced Sunday, will include an interview
with First Lady Barbara Bush, a beauty layout with model Cindy
Crawford, food and fashion features and a marriage counseling
column.
   Dare Fragrance by Quintessence is the sole sponsor of the
special supplement, and its ads will feature the Soviet aerialist
Lena Golovko.
   The Soviet press agency Novosti has agreed to distribute the
10,000 copies that will include the supplement tucked inside the
regular English-language November issue at kiosks and bookstores in
several Soviet cities.
   The magazine is expected to go on sale in Moscow for about 5
rubles per copy in early October.
   Blyth said Ladies Home Journal had no plans to publish any more
Russian-language sections after this one.
   She said the special issue was designed to kick off the
magazine's celebration of the 50th anniversary of its trademarked
slogan, ``Never Underestimate the Power of a Woman.''
   Blyth declined to say how much the fragrance company was paying
to be the sole sponsor of the supplement. The perfume is not
available in the Soviet Union, she said, but its manufacturers said
they felt the Russian market ``has potential for the future.''
   The Ladies Home Journal has a circulation in the United States
of just over 5 million, making it one of the 10 largest circulation
magazines here.

<TEXT>
   The hiring plans of U.S. businesses for the last
three months of 1990 are down from the previous quarter and a year
earlier, reflecting the nation's stagnant economy, according to a
survey released today.
   In a survey of more than 15,000 businesses by Manpower Inc., 23
percent said they plan to increase hiring activity in the fourth
quarter of 1990 while 11 percent plan to reduce the size of their
work force.
   That is down from 26 percent and 9 percent, respectively, in the
same 1989 period. The figures also are below the 27 percent planned
hiring and 8 percent planned staff reductions in this year's third
quarter.
   Manpower, a temporary employment firm, attributed the
pessimistic hiring plans in large part to declining economic
conditions in the Northeast that began early last year.
   Manpower said its latest quarterly survey was conducted before
the Middle East crisis began. Manpower President Mitchell Fromstein
said the call-up of military reserves could alter hiring practices
if it lasts an extended time. Jobs of activated reservists are
guaranteed upon return.
   Construction industry hiring expectations were especially weak,
with 17 percent of firms planning additional hiring but 20 percent
expecting employment declines. Manpower said that marked the first
negative year-end outlook for the industry in eight years.
   In other fields, 17 percent of transportation and public
utilities said they planned to hire workers, with 10 percent
anticipating staff declines. Government employer plans were their
weakest since mid-1983, the survey said, with 18 percent planning
additions and 13 percent declines.
   Bulking up for the holiday season, 32 percent of wholesale and
retail employers plan to add workers, while 9 percent plan
cutbacks. Still, manpower said the hiring activity is below
seasonal expectations in other years.
   The survey measures employers' intentions to increase or
decrease the permanent work force. It is based on telephone
interviews with more than 15,000 businesses in 475 U.S. cities.

   Like nearly all domestic carriers, it had announced a 5.3
percent increase Aug. 30, prompted by fuel prices that have soared
since Iraq invaded oil-rich Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Pan Am Corp., one of the industry giants, was the first to take
the plunge with a second-round fare boost, but its increase is
smaller _ 4.4 percent.
   The New York-based parent of Pan American Airways announced the
additional increase for domestic service Aug. 31, one day after the
first-round rise. The increase, which goes into effect Sept. 18,
will not affect international fares.
   Alaska Air is taking a chance with its second-round jump.
   ``It's very out of character for Alaska to take the lead in fare
increases in national terms,'' Alaska Air spokesman Greg Witter
said Friday.
   ``We're simply trying to get the ball rolling here,'' he said,
noting Alaska Air's fuel bill has jumped 53 percent since late
July, from an average 64 cents a gallon to 98 cents by Friday.
   The initial increase simply wasn't big enough to cover costs, he
said.
   Alaska Airlines, which serves 37 cities in eight western states
and Mexico, and Horizon, which flies to 34 cities in five Pacific
Northwest states and British Columbia, are prepared to back off.
   ``We will scuttle the fare increase if the competition doesn't
follow suit,'' Witter said. ``We refuse to put ourselves in a
position where we're non-competitive.''
   Rising fuel prices may not be the only issue for Alaska Air.
   The carrier has been embroiled for months in reduced-fare
battles on the lucrative West Coast corridor, where it is one of
the last regional carriers, said industry analyst Robert Decker
with the Chicago-based Duff &amp; Phelps investment research firm.
   ``Alaska's fare increase may be related to fare-cutting as much
as anything else, and to get their fares up to economic levels,''
Decker said. ``Alaska Airlines is really a niche player, and
getting fares back up is very important to them.''
   Alaska Airlines, with a reputation for excellent passenger
service and premium meals, has about a 1 percent share of the
overall domestic market. It dominates air traffic between Alaska
and the Lower 48 with a 52 percent share.
   The industry's first-round increase was slow in coming, and
``the 5.3 percent increase wasn't enough,'' Witter said.
   Several major carriers, including American Airlines and Delta
Airlines, delayed increases planned to counter rising fuel prices
because some competitors refused to budge from pre-invasion prices.
   And even the 5.3 percent jump isn't expected to fully compensate
airlines for the effects of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Some airlines had considered 10 percent boosts, but the industry
finally settled on the smaller increase.
   Industry analyst Bill Whitlow with Dain, Bosworth in Seattle,
said Alaska Air needs the second-round increase to survive the
soaring fuel prices.
   Larger carriers have the financial resources to swallow the
losses if they prove to be short-term, Whitlow said.
   Witter said Alaska Air's 101-plane fleet _ Alaska Airlines' 55
jetliners and Horizon's 46 propeller planes _ burns about 18
million gallons of fuel a month.
   The fuel-price increases cost the carrier about $6 million in
the first month after the invasion, he said.
   That's significant for a carrier with reported profits of $9.6
million during the second quarter of 1990 and operating revenues of
$263.3 million.

<HEAD>China's First Pizza Hut Opens in Beijing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's first Pizza Hut opened Monday in Beijing
and served 200 pizzas to an invitation-only crowd of Chinese and
foreigners before running out of dough.
   By mid-afternoon, the restaurant was turning away guests.
   ``We have to wait for the dough to rise so it'll take about an
hour,'' one waitress said. Other waitresses said there would be a
two-hour wait.
   Henry Foo, general manager of Beijing Pizza Corp. Ltd., which
operates the outlet, said more guests turned up than expected.
   In the future, the two-story, 180-seat restaurant expects to
serve about 285 pizzas daily, mainly to foreign tourists and
foreign residents of Beijing. Most Chinese have never eaten pizza
and many don't like cheese, which is alien to the Chinese diet.
   Until now, pizza has been available only in a few joint-venture
hotels in China, which do not allow ordinary Chinese free access.
   But company chairman Jiang Tinzhi said the new Pizza Hut also
hopes to attract Chinese customers.
   ``Pizzas have been accepted by other Asian communities, and they
will be accepted in China as well,'' Jiang said.
   ``It's terrific. It's delicious,'' was the assessment of
16-year-old Liu Mei, one of the first customers, who said she had
never eaten a pizza before.
   But some Chinese standing outside, looking at the price, said it
was too expensive. The cost of a pizza is the equivalent of about
$4.60.
   ``That's almost one sixth of my (monthly) salary. I have to save
before I can bring my 3-year-old son here to have a meal,'' said
one man.
   Beijing Pizza Corp Ltd. is a $1 million joint venture between
the Hong Kong-based AMIT Ltd., which holds 60 percent, and the
Beijing International Business Services Corp. It holds a 15-year
franchise from the U.S.-based Pizza Hut chain, a subsidiary of
PepsiCo Inc.
   William Heinecke, vice chairman of the joint-venture company,
predicted the restaurant will become profitable after three years.
   Cheese, spices and tomato paste are being imported and other
ingredients will be purchased locally, he said.

<TEXT>
   Congressional leaders and
White House negotiators raced the clock Sunday, trying to narrow
their differences over the budget and reach an agreement for fiscal
1991.
   The two sides worked for a third straight day at Andrews Air
Force Base in Maryland, 20 minutes from the capital, spending much
of their time discussing taxes. Lawmakers have said they want to
finish work by Monday to give Congress time to enact a package of
savings by the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year.
   There had been talk of a meeting at the White House Monday
morning, but those tentative plans were scuttled as the bargainers
broke for the night with still too much preliminary work to do when
they resume talks Monday. President Bush returned to Washington
late Sunday after his Helsinki summit meeting with Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Returning with Bush aboard Air Force One, White House chief of
staff John Sununu told reporters he had been told by administration
budget director Richard Darman that ``not much progress has been
made at the talks.''
   Congress and the Bush administration have been deadlocked all
year over how to reduce the deficit.
   The bargainers have been searching for a combination of new
taxes and spending cuts producing $50 billion in savings for next
year and $500 billion over the next five years. Inaction could mean
a record $250 billion deficit next year.
   Democrats and Republicans have clashed all year over how to
achieve budget savings. Democrats have tried to emphasize defense
reductions and new taxes while Republicans have sought to pare
domestic programs.
   An official said the two sides were considering about $10
billion in cuts in benefit programs such as Medicare and aid to
farmers. When the talks began Friday, Democrats offered reductions
of $7.2 billion, while Republicans pressed for $15.5 billion.
   Republicans were hoping to limit cuts in the $303 billion
defense budget to about $4 billion. Democrats, after initially
demanding about $15 billion in reductions, eased their proposal by
$2 billion.
   Each side was seeking about $25 billion in new taxes and federal
fees, but their components varied.
   Democrats wanted to raise income taxes paid by the wealthy and
impose new levies on energy, gasoline, alcoholic products and
luxury items such as boats and jewelry.
   Republicans were pressing for new taxes on beer and wine,
eliminating some income-tax deductions for the rich and cutting the
capital gains tax rate.
   The bargainers, who had come to Andrews to avoid distractions,
had their talks interrupted unexpectedly Saturday night, officials
said.
   The negotiations have been held in the base's officers' club, a
sprawling building that has continued to be used for wedding
receptions.
   Shortly after 10 p.m. Saturday, a fire alarm was set off,
supposedly by a musician who inadvertently hung a coat on it. Like
everyone else in the building, the bargainers had to evacuate. That
ended the negotiations for the evening.

<HEAD>Rig Count Finally Feels Effects of Oil Prices As it Soars to 1,039</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States soared by 27 this week to 1,039 _ an indication that
the domestic oil patch finally is feeling the effects of the Middle
East crisis, Baker Hughes Inc. reported today.
   ``This is the second highest this year,'' said Ike Kerridge, who
keeps track of the count for Baker Hughes. ``It's the highest since
Jan. 2 when the count was 1,042.''
   Although the count traditionally increases this time of year,
Kerridge said the jump was clearly larger than he expected.
   ``I think this is the beginning of the reflection of the higher
(oil) prices,'' he said.
   Kerridge has said he expected it to take several weeks for the
rig count to increase in response to rising oil prices.
   Last week, the count increased by 10 to 1,012. A year ago this
week, the count increased by 14 to 950.
   Baker Hughes, a Houston-based oil toolmaker company, has kept
track of the rig count since 1940. The count _ the widely watched
index of drilling activity _ represents the number of rigs actively
exploring for oil, not those producing oil.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Texas was the big winner this week, with its count climbing by
11. Among other major oil-producing states, New Mexico's count was
up five, Colorado was up by four and Louisiana gained three rigs.
   Wyoming, Oklahoma and Michigan each gained two more rigs, while
Ohio's count was up by one.
   The only state to lose this week was California, where the rig
count was down by 12.

   Union leaders of Greyhound Lines' striking bus
drivers are discussing with investment bankers a possible buyout
offer for the Dallas-based company, which filed for bankruptcy in
June.
   Local presidents and officials of the Amalgamated Transit Union
met Sunday in Washington with the general partner of the Blackstone
Group, a New York firm with an $800 million investment fund.
   Richard Ravitch, Blackstone's general partner, said the session
was intended to be ``an opportunity to meet members of the union.''
   The Blackstone Group's affiliation with the striking union
places a new twist on the ATU's effort to gain control of Greyhound
from chairman Fred Currey.
   Currey led a 1987 leveraged buyout of Greyhound, a unit of GLI
Holding Inc. Greyhound filed for Chapter 11 reorganization last
June, citing costs incurred by the drivers strike that began in
March.
   ``Our reorganization doesn't include plans for the sale of the
company,'' Greyhound spokesman George Gravley told The Dallas
Morning News on Sunday.
   The company is preparing its plan of reorganization and expects
to submit it to federal bankruptcy court in early November, Gravley
said. If that plan is approved by its creditors, Greyhound expects
to emerge from Chapter 11 by mid-1991.

   Oil prices fell sharply early today, then
rebounded a bit after Iran and Iraq restored diplomatic ties in
what was viewed as a move by Iraq to try busting international
trade sanctions.
   Light sweet crude opened $1.49 lower at $28.55 per barrel for
October contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange following the
weekend summit between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev in Helsinki, Finland. The superpowers called for the
restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty, calming traders who had been
nervous about the Middle East standoff.
   But oil regained some ground late in the morning, moving up to
$29.10 per barrel on news that Iran and Iraq were becoming friendly
for the first time since their war of the 1980s.
   ``The big move down was on the open,'' said Brian Tagler, a
trader with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``That was pretty much
based on what happened over the weekend in Helsinki. The solidarity
between the United States and the Soviet Union appeared to give the
impression that the markets were under control.''
   Oil prices moved back up following the news from Iran and Iraq.
Iraq's oil has been boycotted by crude-purchasing nations since it
invaded neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Traders were also responding to reports that Iraq would be
moving some of its troops away from the Iranian border and sending
them toward the Saudi Arabian border, Tagler said. The U.S.
military force is positioned along the border to keep Iraqis out of
Saudi Arabia.
   Later in the morning, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced
his country would provide Third World countries with free oil in
what he called a gesture of solidarity. The oil markets did not
immediatley make any large swings following his statement.
   Other petroleum futures were trading lower around midday.
   Unleaded gasoline was down 1.81 cents to 91.25 cents per gallon
for October delivery. Home heating oil was down 2.68 cents to 81.30
cents per gallon for October delivery.
   Natural gas was unchanged at $1.510 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   Contracts for all of the petroleum futures were trading lower
for delivery in later months.

   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq today
offered to provide Third World countries with oil free of charge in
what he described as a gesture of solidarity.
   But the Iraqi leader did not say how the oil would be
transported. A U.N.-ordered embargo bans trade with Iraq.
   ``We hereby declare that we are prepared to supply all Third
World countries with oil free of charge in accordance with the
needs of each country,'' Saddam said in his latest televised
message.
   The statement was read by a broadcaster on Iraqi state radio and
television, monitored in Nicosia via satellite and translated from
the Arabic by The Associated Press.
   Saddam addressed his message to Third World governments, but did
not specify the countries. He said he was making the offer
regardless of the various governments' stands in the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   The initiative is ``in appreciation for your evenhanded policies
toward Arab causes, the foremost of which is the Palestinian
cause,'' Saddam said.
   ``We are brothers to you. We share the same destiny,'' he told
the Third World countries.
   Saddam said that since Iraq would not be able to transport the
oil because of the U.N. embargo, the countries who want the oil
should arrange transport themselves.
   He claimed his offer should not violate the U.N. embargo,
because no buying or selling was involved. The embargo was imposed
shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell moderately
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting a lack of
significant new export demand and perceptions that the corn and
soybean crops are improving.
   Sharp early declines in the energy and precious metal markets
also contributed to weakness in the crop markets, said Walter
Spilka, a grains analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in
New York.
   The soybean complex led today's early retreat amid
disappointment that the Bush administration did not announce plans
to grant agricultural export credits to the Soviet Union, analysts
said.
   Good rainfall over the weekend in the Mississippi Delta region
also weighed on the soybean market, while forecasts for the Midwest
predicted mild conditions as the corn harvest nears.
   ``Sunshine and warm, mild temperatures is all they need,''
Spilka said of both the corn and soybean crops.
   ``It seems like we're heading toward a perfect finish here if we
don't get an early frost,''
   Prices also were pressured by expectations that the government
will increase its corn and soybean harvest estimates in a crop
report due out on Wednesday.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1\ cents to 2{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.61{ a bushel;
corn futures were 1{ cents to 3{ cents lower with September at
$2.36 a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2\ cents lower with September
bid at $1.06{ a bushel; soybeans were 1\ cents to 6\ cents lower

   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .20 cent higher with October at
78.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .32 cent higher
with September at 87.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent to
.60 cent higher with October at 49.80 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .83 cent to .88 cent higher with February at 52.95

   Cattle futures advanced on Friday; pork futures were mixed.

<TEXT>
   Congressional leaders and
administration officials say they still have a wide gulf between
them after three days of intensive talks that have yet to produce a
deficit-cutting deal for next year.
   The two sides began a fourth day of bargaining today at Andrews
Air Force Base, 20 minutes from Washington. One official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said there was still ``no movement''
toward completing a pact.
   White House and Democratic bargainers said they were frustrated
the talks have not progressed further.
   ``I would say the talks are going nowhere fast,'' Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady said today on ABC's ``Good Morning
America.'' ``I'm not heartened by progress in the talks. It's
disappointing.''
   Brady said he doubted the negotiations would achieve agreement
in time to avoid mandatory budget reductions in most federal
programs at the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1.
   ``I'm optimistic that we'll get a deal at some point. I'm not
optimistic that these particular talks will produce it in time,''
Brady said.
   The chief Democratic negotiator, House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., had tentatively planned to discuss the standoff
with President Bush at the White House today.
   But Brady denied a meeting was planned.
   ``I can't see the purpose of a White House meeting,'' he said.
Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the session was
canceled because so much work remained. Instead, they said,
bargaining would continue today and perhaps Tuesday as well.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu, returning from Finland
with Bush aboard Air Force One, told reporters late Sunday that he
had learned that ``not much progress'' has been made at the budget
talks.
   Asked about that remark, one Democratic participant said, ``I
think that's a fair description.''
   The bargainers' goal has been to shake hands on a package-saving
$50 billion next year and $500 billion over the next five years.
Many had said they wanted to complete their bargaining by today to
give Congress time to enact the plan by Oct. 1, the start of the
new fiscal year.
   But participants said they still had much work to do. They spent
much of Sunday discussing taxes and benefit programs.
   Both sides are seeking about $25 billion in new taxes and fees.
Democrats have proposed raising income tax rates for the wealthy,
and placing new levies on energy, gasoline, alcohol and luxury
items such as furs and private planes.
   Republicans have suggested reducing the capital gains tax rate,
which they say will raise money, limiting the deductibility of
state and local income taxes and boosting alcohol levies.
   A major gulf remained over Pentagon spending. Democrats wanted
to slash Bush's $303 billion defense request by $15 billion, while
Republicans wanted to limit the reduction to $4 billion. Officials
said each side had eased its position somewhat but that
disagreement remained.
   Republicans began the talks seeking deeper cuts than Democrats
in benefit programs such as Medicare. By Sunday, the two sides were
considering about $10 billion in reductions in those programs,
about midway between their opening positions.
   The negotiators met at the Air Force base officers' club,
keeping reporters confined to a press center about two miles away.
   Their justification for the unusual site of the sessions _
eliminating distractions _ was shattered Saturday evening when a
fire alarm clanged in the building at about 10 o'clock.
   Officials said a musician at a wedding reception being held
elsewhere in the club accidentally placed a coat on the alarm. The
bargaining recessed for the evening.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   H.J. Heinz Co.'s first-quarter earnings
increased 13.2 percent because of higher food prices and favorable
exchange rates for foreign currency, the food maker said Monday.
   Heinz posted earnings of $143.2 million in the company's first
quarter which ended Aug. 1, up from $126.6 million in the same 1989
period.
   Per-share earnings were 54 cents, up from 48 cents in the
year-ago period. The 12.5 percent increase reflected a two-for-one
stock split in the form of distribution of shares, Heinz said.
   Sales increased 7.4 percent to $1.56 billion from $1.45 billion,
Heinz said.

   The dough is rising, the tomato sauce is simmering
and deep pans are being oiled at Pizza Hut's first two Soviet
restaurants, which are set to open Tuesday in Moscow.
   After three years of negotiations and seven months of
construction, 300 young workers are ready to serve up
American-style pizza, garlic bread, salad and apple pies for both
dollars and rubles.
   The opening comes one day after Pizza Hut's first restaurant
opened in Beijing. The Beijing restaurant served 200 pizzas to an
invitation-only crowd of Chinese and foreigners before running out
of dough. By mid-afternoon, it was turning away disappointed people.
   Pepsico Inc., which owns Pizza Hut, says the invitation to set
up business in Moscow was initiated by the former Soviet ambassador
to the United States, Anatoly Dobrinyn, who frequently ate with his
family at Pizza Hut in Washington, D.C.
   The restaurants are technically owned by Moscow Pizza, a $10
million joint venture between Moscow's restaurant department and
Pepsico's European branch.
   The Soviet workers were selected from more than 3,000 applicants
and received weeks of training here and in London in more than just
the cooking and serving of pizza. Andy Rafalet, regional operations
director, said they had to learn to smile, not snarl like many
Soviet restaurant workers, and recognize the body language of
hungry or impatient customers.
   Similar training was given when McDonald's introduced fast food
to the Soviet Union eight months ago.
   One of the new pizzerias is on Gorky Street, a main thoroughfare
minutes from the Kremlin. It seats 120 people and features a
take-out window selling slices of pizza for rubles only.
   The bigger of the two restaurants, near a large foreigners'
compound on Kutuzovsky Prospekt, will have a take-out service and
separate dining rooms for ruble- and dollar-paying customers.
   The decor is like any other Pizza Hut, down to the red-and-white
checked tabletops, red chrome chairs, fake tropical plants and red
roof logo. But in a concession to the long Soviet winters, dozens
of brass coatracks have been installed to accommodate bulky coats,
scarves and hats.
   A special Moscow pizza topped with salmon, smoked sardines and
onions has been added to a menu listing only nine combinations. No
substitutions are allowed. Soviets are not accustomed to large
menus because most restaurants here offer limited choices, and many
of those are unavailable on any given day.
   The salad bars in the Moscow Pizza Huts are short on lettuce and
heavy on the coleslaw;, the coffee hasn't arrived yet; and the
Kutuzovsky restaurant ran out of Pepsi one hour into a pre-opening
press bash.
   But Moscow's Communist Party youth newspaper had a sneak preview
and gave it the thumbs up: ``The first thing you are treated to is
a smile. And at once you start feeling easy and at home.''
   ``In less than a minute, a pretty waitress came up to us and
smiled,'' Moskovskaya Komsomolets said. ``(She) asked us what we
would like to order, but we looked blank, salivating and asking her
what each dish she mentioned was.''
   Pizza Hut has imported basic supplies but is relying on local
flour and vegetables. It commissioned its own beer from a local
brewery and is involved in a Soviet joint venture to make
mozzarella cheese.
   Pizza Hut says the four ovens in its bigger restaurant can
produce 5,000 pizzas daily, and it expects to serve 50,000
customers a week, about seven times the turnover of any Pizza Hut
in the United States. McDonald's Moscow outlet still sells 5,000
burgers an hour and the lunchtime lineup is 90 minutes long.
   The restaurants are part of a $3 billion trade pact in which the
Soviet Union will build at least 10 ships, mostly oil tankers, to
be sold or leased by Pepsico in return for foreign credits.
   The two-story, 180-seat Beijing restaurant expects to serve
about 285 pizzas daily, mainly to foreign tourists and foreign
residents of Beijing.
   For some Chinese, the $4.60 price of a pizza was enough to turn
them away from Monday's grand opening. ``That's almost one-sixth of
my salary. I have to save before I can bring my 3-year-old son here
to have a meal,'' said one man outside.

   Anheuser-Busch Inc. announced Monday it will
donate 22,000 cases of O'Doul's non-alcoholic beer to U.S. military
personnel serving in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf.
   A spokesman for the U.S. armed services welcomed the gift. The
shipment will give each serviceman or woman on duty an average of a
six-pack.
   The troop supply of O'Doul's is expected to arrive in about two
weeks, said Mike Roarty, executive vice president of the brewery.
It is being brewed and packaged at the company's plant in Tampa,
Fla., before being trucked to Charleston, S.C., for loading aboard
a ship.
   Army and Air Force supply officials contacted Anheuser-Busch
last week to check on the availability of a non-alcoholic beer for
American troops in the desert.
   Real beer could not be shipped because of religious and
governmental restrictions forbidding alcohol consumption in Saudi
Arabia.

   A drop in oil prices helped the stock market
start off a new week with a broad advance today.
   Trading was light, however.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 27.73 points to
2,647.28 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 974 up, 427
down and 491 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were encouraged by accounts of the weekend
meeting between President Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet
president.
   The two heads of state warned Iraq that new measures would be
taken against it unless it withdrew from Kuwait, which it seized in
an Aug. 2 invasion.
   The meeting was seen as a victory for Bush in his effort to
increase pressure for a settlement of the crisis in the Persian
Gulf on favorable terms for the United States.
   World oil prices fell below $30 a barrel today, and interest
rates declined in the credit markets.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric rose 1\ to

   Energizer's pounding, pink bunny, who hawks
batteries on TV when you least expect it, is back. Only this year
he's planning to barge into movie theatres around the nation.
   The battery-operated, drum-beating rabbit, who bursts into what
appears to be commercials for other products, will make his movie
debut Sept. 21. As usual, he'll be touting the long-lasting
qualities of Energizer batteries.
   Moviegoers in 52 markets will see a convincing, 60-second
preview for a romantic French film called ``Dance With Your Feet''
complete with comments from fictional critics and picturesque views.
   But just as the two main characters are shown in a romantic
interlude, the intruding lagomorph wanders across the screen and
wrecks the mood.
   Three new television spots will also be aired Sept. 17 featuring
the Energizer bunny, E.B., who first began surprising American
television watchers late last year.
   The new TV spots show the bunny intruding on parody commercials
for long-distance telephone service, ``Airdale'' air freshener and
``Chug-A-Cherry'' soda.
   The Eveready Battery Co., a subsidiary of Ralston Purina Co., is

   Soybean futures prices closed moderately higher
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade, rebounding sharply from the
day's lows after a private meteorologist forecast a freeze this
weekend in the Midwest.
   Wheat futures also advanced while corn futures were narrowly
mixed and oats retreated.
   Freezing temperatures would pose a greater threat to the still
maturing soybean crop than to the corn crop, which is nearly ready
for harvest.
   Sources on the trading floor said Central Weather Service, an
Illinois-based forecasting firm headed by Earl Finckle, predicted
temperatures would drop below 32 degrees during the weekend as far
south as the northern edges of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
   Finckle would not confirm the reports, saying his firm provided
commodity weather forecasts only to its subscribers.
   The crop markets opened lower, led by the soybean complex, amid
disappointment that the Bush administration announced no grain
export credits to the Soviet Union after Sunday's summit meeting.
   At the close, wheat futures were 3\ cents to 5 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $2.67} a bushel; corn was

<HEAD>Middle East Crisis Finally Hits Oil Patch, Rig Count Soars to
1,039</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stands for BC-Rig Count</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Middle East crisis finally has made its way
to the domestic oil patch, according to a widely watched index of
drilling activity reported Monday.
   The rig count _ the number of working oil and natural gas rigs
in the United States _ soared by 27 this week to 1,039, the second
highest total this year, Baker Hughes Inc.
   ``I think this is the beginning of the reflection of the higher
(oil) prices,'' said Ike Kerridge, a vice president at
Houston-based Baker Hughes, an oil toolmaker that has tracked the
count since 1940.
   ``This is up more than I would have expected for the seasonal
pattern. I probably would have expected an increase of about 12,''
Kerridge said. The same week last year, the count rose 14 to 950.
   The count reflects the number of rotary rigs exploring for oil
or gas. It has shown some gains since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
last month and the resulting boost in oil prices. Last week, the
count increased by 10 to 1,012.
   But until Monday, Kerridge had attributed most of improvement to
traditional seasonal increases. The oil patch has been suspicious
of the Persian Gulf crisis, and some drilling companies stung by
the oil bust in the 1980s have been hesitant about adding dollars
for oil exploration, fearing any price increase is only temporary.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices tumbled, and the rig count
followed _ hitting a low of 663 in the summer of 1986.
   ``Some of us remember the pain we had to go through in 1986,''
said Don Covey, president of the exploration and production
division of Mitchell Energy &amp; Development Corp., an independent oil
company near Houston. ``We don't want to get caught in that trap
again.''
   But rising oil prices have had some positive impact on
Mitchell's drilling plans, Covey said. The additional revenue from
production has allowed Mitchell to finance two drilling projects on
its own, rather than with a partner as previously planned.
   ``I think you've got to be cautious,'' Covey said. ``It's only
one week.''
   Kerridge said some of the delay in higher rig counts can also be
attributed to the amount of time it takes to gather the permits,
contracts, equipment and crews for a new drilling project.
   ``Some may have started the process immediately, but I think
some probably waited to see if (price increases) were just a
temporary spike,'' he said.
   Whether increases in the rig count are higher than normal the
rest of the year will depend on what happens to oil prices,
Kerridge said.
   ``If people think this is temporary, I don't think you'll see a
prolonged increase,'' he said.
   If higher oil prices persist, Covey said his company probably
will have more money budgeted next year for drilling.
   If drilling continues to increase, some industry executives
believe there may be problems in restoring rigs that have sat idle
during the downturn in the oil industry.
   ``There are a lot of rigs mothballed,'' Covey said, adding he
doesn't know how many can be put back into operation easily.
   But Dale Steffes, an independent oil analyst in Houston,
disagrees.
   ``If the money is there, the people and the rigs will be right
there behind it,'' Steffes said. ``In 1981, we added 1,000 rigs to
the fleet.''
   Steffes said he expects the rig count to show
better-than-average gains because he believes oil prices will
remain in the upper $20s per barrel for the rest of the year.
   ``So the producers will have extra cash flow. A lot of the
majors (oil companies) will not be as quick to put it back in
drilling,'' Steffes said. ``But the independents, the minute they
get their bank notes caught up, they're going to pump the extra
back into drilling _ that's their nature. You give them some extra
money, and that's what they're going to do.''
   According to Monday's rig count, Texas was the big winner this
week, with its count climbing by 11. Among other major
oil-producing states, New Mexico's count was up five, Colorado was
up by four and Louisiana gained three rigs.
   Wyoming, Oklahoma and Michigan each gained two more rigs, while
Ohio's count was up by one.
   The only state to lose this week was California, where the rig
count was down by 12.

   The French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group
Rhone-Poulenc SA will further divest of peripheral assets to help
defray the cost of its $2 billion acquisition of Rorer Inc., the
firm said Monday.
   Assets sales for all of 1990 could bring between 1 billion and
1.5 billion francs, or about $192 million to $288 million in fresh
cash, Rhone-Poulenc chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou told a press
conference.
   He declined to identify which of the group's non-core sectors
would be affected by the new asset sales.
   Rhone-Poulenc announced last week that it is selling off its
Spanish PVC operations to a unit of the Elf Aquitaine oil group for
an undisclosed amount.
   Fourtou said his group will be in better financial shape in the
coming years once it digests the loans it raised to finance its 40
billion franc ($7.7 billion) acquisition binge over the past four
years.
   He also reiterated his hope that Rhone-Poulenc's net profit
would return to its 1989 level of 4.1 billion francs, or $788
million.

   An investment banking firm interested in buying
the financially troubled Greyhound Lines is courting the company's
creditors and asking for release of private financial information,
a spokesman said Monday.
   Richard Ravitch, a partner of the New York-based Blackstone
Group, said the firm is contacting Greyhound's creditors ``one at a
time'' to ask their help in obtaining information needed for a
buyout offer.
   ``We don't have access to the data, confidential information
about the company, and we won't have unless the creditor can ask
the company to (release it),'' Ravitch said.
   He and members of the striking bus drivers' union met Sunday in
Washington to discuss a possible buyout offer, which Ravitch said
could include partial employee ownership.
   Greyhound has until Oct. 2 to exclusively present to creditors
its reorganization plan under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   ``It's in (creditors') best interest to have another proposal
than the one they're going to get from the company,'' Ravitch said.
   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said the company is forging a
reorganization plan and expects to present it in November, if the
federal bankruptcy court allows an extension.
   ``The plan does not include sale of the company,'' Gravley said.
If the company's plan is approved by creditors, Greyhound expects
to emerge from Chapter 11 by mid-1991.
   The striking Amalgamated Transit Union has tried to gain control
of Greyhound from chairman Fred Currey, who led a 1987 leveraged
buyout of Greyhound, a unit of GLI Holding Inc. Greyhound filed for
Chapter 11 reorganization in June, citing costs incurred by the
drivers strike that began in March.
   Union local presidents and other labor officials met Sunday in
Washington with the general partner of Blackstone, which has an
$800 million investment fund.
   ``Mr. Ravitch came before the council to indicate that he
continued to be interested in buying the company, and in doing that
under terms that would bring about an end to the labor dispute with
the union,'' said Earle Putnam, the union's general counsel.
   Ravitch also said ``he was hoping to be able to get more
information from the company about his financial condition and its
operating condition that would enable him to put a value on the
company and understand what would be required to restore it to full
operation,'' Putnam said.
   Putnam said Blackstone ``would deal with union at arm's
length.'' He said a buyout ``would result in new collective
bargaining agreement.''
   As far as partial worker-ownership, Putnam said, ``The most the
union would have would be a minority stock interest that would be
created through a profit-sharing plan.
   ``It's never been our intention to own the company in the terms
of putting in cash or dominating the board or management,'' he said.
   Also figuring in the company's future is a pivotal trial before
the National Labor Relations Board on alleged unfair labor
practices brought against Greyhound in Milwaukee. The trial, set
for this month, was rescheduled to November.
   The NLRB is deciding whether to pursue other such charges filed
against the company by the union. Should the Milwaukee complaint be
upheld, Greyhound could be forced to rehire striking drivers and
give them millions of dollars in back pay.
   The drivers' union had considered its own buyout offer before
the company filed bankruptcy, negotiating with a New Jersey
investment firm to represent the ATU. However, no offer was made
nor were any meetings held.

<HEAD>Foxboro Co. Announces 1,600 Layoffs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCIS HOPKINS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foxboro Co., a multimillion-dollar company
recently bought by a British firm, announced Monday it would lay
off 1,600 employees worldwide as part of a restructuring.
   ``While the path we have chosen is ambitious and initially
painful, especially for the people directly impacted, the results
of these actions will be improved prosperity and growth,'' said E.
Barrie Stephens, chairman of Siebe PLC.
   Siebe is a private manufacturer of electrical equipment
headquartered in Windsor, England. It purchased Foxboro three
months ago for $656.4 million, or $52 a share.
   The firm now controls 98 percent of Foxboro stock, and has made
arrangements to buy the final 2 percent of the Foxboro, Mass.-based
company.
   The British company said it would be laying off 1,600 people
over the next two quarters from Foxboro, which makes process
control instruments and systems.
   John C. Fuller, a spokesman for Foxboro, said about 800 of the
layoffs will be from four plants in Massachusetts, and the rest
from its European facilities.
   Fuller said Siebe was streamlining Foxboro and planned to
restructure the company by increasing its global market and
improving its manufacturing abilities and technology.
   ``I don't think any of it is directly related to how much
(Siebe) paid or didn't pay. I think it is related to restoring the
profitability level,'' Fuller said.
   He said Foxboro had not made money in three of the last five
years. ``This is looked more on as refocusing primarily on
financial operations and sales and customer service and engineering
operations,'' he said. ``In other words, focusing on the core of
the business.''
   Siebe completed the purchase of the company a week ago. On
Friday, Gary K. Willis, president and chief executive officer of
Foxboro, was fired and 300 employees at a plant in Foxboro were
laid off. Fuller said the layoffs were across the board, with few
departments remaining untouched.
   Willis, whose firing was not announced until Monday, was not
removed as part of the streamlining and will be replaced soon,
Fuller said.
   ``I think the cutbacks over the past few years indicated the
buck stops somewhere and someone had to take responsibility for
it,'' Fuller said of Willis.
   He said the restructuring was expected to take six months to
complete.
   Stephens said in a written statement the new headquarters for
Foxboro Europe will be based in Germany, and will be the center of
its sales and service organizations in the United Kingdom, France,
Italy and the Netherlands.

<HEAD>New Toyota Plant to be Announced in 2 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp., which plans to boost its U.S.
vehicle sales by a third by the mid-1990s, plans to announce the
site of a new U.S. assembly plant within two months, a spokesman
said Monday.
   Spokesman John McCandless said several sites are being
considered for the new factory.
   Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, operates its own car assembly
plant in Georgetown, Ky., and is a partner with General Motors
Corp. in the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. plant in Fremont,
Calif., near San Francisco.
   Toyota also has a carmaking plant in Cambridge, Ontario.
   Toyota executives have said the company wants to boost its U.S.
sales to 1.5 million cars and trucks by the mid-1990s and a new
plant is needed to accomplish that goal.
   For the first eight months of this year, Toyota sold 729,272
cars and trucks in the United States. That works out to an annual
rate of about 1.1 million vehicles.
   Toyota has an opportunity in 1996 to further boost its U.S.
production by buying out GM's interest in the NUMMI project in
California. Last month, Gary Convis, NUMMI's manufacturing vice
president, said Toyota planned to exercise that option.
   Other Japanese companies operating manufacturing plants in the
United States include Honda Motor Co. Ltd. at Marysville and East
Liberty, Ohio; Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. at Smyrna, Tenn.; and Mazda
Motor Corp. at Flat Rock, Mich.
   Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. jointly operate a
plant in Normal, Ill.; as do Fuji Heavy Industries Inc. and Isuzu
Motors Ltd., in Lafayette, Ind.

   Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. and Electronic

on a previously announced partnership involving a new computer
reservations system.
   The transaction, originally announced in February, involves
formation of the CRS computer reservations system partnership and
the sale of Continental's System One telecommunications, technology
and airline services units to EDS for $250 million.
   The agreement makes Dallas-based EDS, a subsidiary of General
Motors Corp., the first non-airline company to participate in an
airline reservation system.
   EDS, which provides information technology services to customers
worldwide, also will provide Continental Airlines and Eastern Air
Lines all of its data processing and telecommunications
requirements.
   ``The transaction will bring $7 million to $10 million in cost
savings to the airlines in the first year alone, while enhancing a
critical distribution system for their travel product,'' said
System One Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard E. Murray.
   The agreements that involve Eastern have been forwarded to the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, which has jurisdiction over the Eastern's
bankruptcy proceedings, for approval.
   System One, a subsidiary of Continental, is a computer
automation company, providing worldwide information management,
data processing and telecommunications services to the airlines and
travel-related industries.
   The system enables travel agents to book reservations for
airlines, hotels, car rentals and other traveler needs.

<HEAD>U.S. Considering More Technology Transfers to USSR, Mosbacher Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union, seeking to make oil production
its top foreign currency earner, has asked for a second meeting
with visiting heads of American energy firms, U.S. Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher said Monday.
   Mosbacher is leading a delegation of 15 chief executives to the
Soviet Union, which at Moscow's request includes the heads of seven
energy companies. On Monday, they met with Foreign Economic
Relations Minister Konstantin Katushev before having pizza and beer
at one of two Pizza Hut restaurants to open Tuesday.
   ``Minister Katushev particularly asked that there be another
meeting with the energy people to expedite the energy opportunities
and developments in exploration and refining and other things that
might be pursued and moved faster,'' Mosbacher told a news
conference.
   ``With oil at a higher prices, and their flow of oil decreasing,
they're very anxious to build up their production as the No. 1
source of hard currency for them.''
   The Soviet Union's antiquated and long-mismanaged oil industry
produced about 12.1 billion barrels of oil a day last year,
one-sixth of the world's total.
   It exported 3.7 million barrels a day, about half of it to the
West. Oil analysts estimated that netted the Soviets $20 billion,
about 40 percent of its badly needed hard currency.
   Mosbacher's delegation includes chief executives of Atlantic
Richfield Co., Chevron Corp., Pruet Oil Co., Texaco Inc., Archer
Daniels Midland Co., Dresser Industries Inc., and The Louisiana
Land and Exploration Co.
   Mosbacher said Monday's talks about extending American know-how
in the energy, agricultural and home-building industries were
general, ``but under the right conditions, I think they could move
from there to (concrete actions) actually being accomplished quite
quickly.''
   He said the U.S. administration is looking at increasing the
level of permitted technology transfers to the Soviet Union,
``always precluding at this point that technology which could be
used directly militarily.''
   ``The technology that is being sent to the Soviet Union is of a
higher nature than it has been and we are examining and
re-examining the possibility of even raising the level further,''
he said.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in a television
interview Sunday night that he discussed increased technology
transfers during his Helsinki summit with President Bush.
   ``Today we mine our natural resources but we don't use them
effectively enough, and they (the United States) have the
techonology and they proposed and named something in order to
secure the better use of our raw materials and protect the
environment,'' Gorbachev said.
   He said Bush also promised to remove all obstacles preventing
the Soviet Union and the United States from jointly developing a
new civilian aircraft.
   ``It's a very big business deal, on a big scale,'' he said.
   The Bush administration said last week it would take a fresh
look at economic aid to the Soviet Union in light of Moscow's
support and cooperation in trying to resolve the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   But it said it remains hamstrung by the Jackson-Vanik amendment
enacted to punish the Soviets for preventing free emigration. The
amendment also prevents the Soviets from obtaining
most-favored-nation trading status.
   ``So the economic help we're talking about is the private sector
coming in and investing and helping develop and helping train,''
Mosbacher said.
   The Soviet Union introduced legislation last year lifting most
travel restrictions on its citizens, but the measures have not yet
been passed.
   ``We hope they'll move quickly now,'' Mosbacher said. ``If they
don't, we'll have to re-examine it, but at this point there are no
plans in the short term to do that.''

   The stock market closed narrowly mixed Monday
after a volatile session influenced by wide swings in oil prices.
   Trading was light.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 30 points at
its best level of the day, finished with a 3.96 loss at 2,615.59.
   Advancing issues held a narrow edge on declde
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 777 up, 739
down and 465 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 119.73 million
shares, against 123.80 million in the previous session. Nationines in nationwiwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 143.89 million shares.
   Stock prices rose sharply at the opening in buying encouraged by
accounts of the weekend meeting between President Bush and Mikhail
Gorbachev, the Soviet president.
   The two heads of state warned Iraq that new measures would be
taken against it unless it withdrew from Kuwait, which it seized in
an Aug. 2 invasion.
   The meeting was seen as a victory for Bush in his effort to
increase pressure for a settlement of the crisis in the Persian
Gulf on favorable terms for the United States.
   But world oil prices, after taking a sharp drop at ctively traded stocks,
the market lost $10.55 billion, or 0.34
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slumped .81 to 176.70.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.08 to 380.57, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.77 at 321.63.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Plunge with Oil but Close Too Soon to Share in
Rebound</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metal futures prices tumbled Monday, reflecting a
stronger dollar and pronounced weakness in the oil market for most
of the day.
   Oil prices staged an abrupt reversal late in the session, after
the metal markets closed, and ended with sharp gains.
   On other commodity markets, copper futures sank; grains and
soybeans were mixed; and livestock and meat futures advanced.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled $10.90 to
$12.60 lower with the contract for delivery in September down
$10.90 at $378.60 a troy ounce; silver finished 4.5 cents to 5.2
cents lower with September at $4.755 a troy ounce.
   Platinum futures ended $24.30 to $24.80 lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with September at $455.40 a troy ounce.
   Light sweet crude oil for October delivery opened at $28.55 a
barrel on the New York Merc, down nearly $1.50 from Friday's
settlement. The opening drop largely reflected perceptions that the
joint U.S.-Soviet condemnation of Iraqi hostility in the Persian
Gulf region had further reduced the likelihood of an all-out Middle
East war, said Peter Cardillo, commodity trading adviser with
Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York.
   Gasoline and heating oil futures also opened sharply lower in
New York, which eased inflation fears and reduced investor interest
in gold as an inflation hedge, analysts said.
   Precious metals also were pressed by the stronger dollar and by
heavy trade selling of platinum, which scraped the bottom of its
$25-an-ounce daily price limit at one point.
   Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the biggest factor in the precious metals'
decline was a perception that the Persian Gulf standoff will not
lead to a shooting war.
   ``That's today's perception,'' she said. ``Tomorrow's perception
may change _ and I suspect it will.''
   Analysts were at a loss to explain the oil market's sudden
rebound, which occurred very late in the session after trading in
the precious metals had ceased.
   Stephen Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said some players
fear the resumption of diplomatic relations between Iraq and its
former enemy Iran may signal the beginning of a military alliance.
   Cardillo said oil's rally was inspired by crude's failure to
fall very far below its opening level.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 91 cents to $1.26 higher with
October at $31.30 a barrel; heating oil was 1.48 cents to 2.63
cents higher with October at 85.89 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .74 cent to 1.96 cents higher with October at 94.56
cents a gallon.
   Copper futures followed gold and silver lower on the Commodity
Exchange. Copper gave back more than a quarter of Friday's gains,
which had pushed the market to its highest level in nearly a year.
   Copper settled 1.65 cents to 2.95 cents higher with September at
$1.338 a pound.
   Soybean futures rose moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade
after a private meteorologist forecast a freeze this weekend in the
Midwest.
   Wheat futures also advanced while corn futures were narrowly
mixed and oats retreated.
   A weekly Agriculture Department report released after the close
showed 17 percent of the corn crop mature as of Sunday and 11
percent of the soybean crop dropping leaves.
   The crops remained well behind the normal pace due to late
plantings.
   Wheat futures settled 3{ cents to 5 cents higher with September
at $2.67} a bushel; corn was { cent lower to } cent higher with
September at $2.39{ a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 1} cents lower
with September at $1.07\ a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 7\
cents higher with September at $6.19{ a bushel.
   Stronger cash markets supported livestock and meat futures on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures settled .25 cent to .58 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in October at 78.55 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .33 cent to .55 cent higher with September at 87.70
cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent to .82 cent higher with
October at 50.17 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .72 cent
to 1.2 cents higher with February at 53.17 cents a pound.

   The dollar rose against most major currencies
Monday, but it was the Japanese yen that dominated foreign exchange
trading.
   Gold prices fell sharply in New York as traders perceived an
easing of the crisis in the Middle East after the weekend summit
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Analysts said the yen, which fell sharply in recent weeks as
tensions continued in the Persian Gulf, regained strength following
the Bank of Japan's decision Aug. 30 to raise its discount rate.
   A recovery on the Tokyo Stock Exchange has raised interest in
Japanese investments, and traders who had placed their money into
currencies such as the British pound recently were now turning to
the yen, said James T. McGroarty, a senior vice president with
Greenwich Capital Markets Inc.
   Investors also believed that interest rates in Britain, which
have supported the pound, would begin to decline from their current
high levels, McGroarty said. Such a development would make sterling
a less attractive investment.
   The dollar was higher against all major currencies except the
yen Monday, but ``it's more of an individual currency assessment
rather than an overall dollar view,'' McGroarty said.
   In New York, the dollar fell to 139.52 yen from late Friday's
140.10. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell to a closing 139.43
Japanese yen from 140.25 Friday, and in London, it fell to 139.20
yen.
   The pound fell sharply against the dollar, closing at $1.8580 in
New York, compared with late Friday's $1.8930. In London earlier,
sterling fell to $1.8565 from $1.8933 dollars late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.5820 German marks, up from 1.5680; 1.3175 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3055; 5.3005 French francs, up from 5.2530;
1,180.00 Italian lire, up from 1,170.50; and 1.16675 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.16335.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
levels, included: 1.5808 German marks, up from 1.5665; 1.3197 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3055; 5.2985 French francs, up from 5.2465;
1.7822 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7653; 1,180.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,168.50; and 1.1703 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1633.
   In gold dealings, analysts said the weekend summit meeting
heartened New York traders. Gold is seen as a hedge during times of
political uncertainty, so the metal fell as the markets felt
reassured.
   David Ryan, chief trader and vice president for bullion trading
at Dean Witter, said gold prices continued to fall as they reached
several technical support levels Monday.
   On the Commodity Exchange, gold for September fell $10.90 to
$378.60 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of
$379.90, down $10.10.
   Gold fell by smaller amounts overseas. In London, it slipped to
a late bid of $384.75 a troy ounce from $386.75 late Friday, and in
Zurich, the metal was unchanged at a closing bid of $387.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.45 an ounce to close at
$384.56.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $4.78 a
troy ounce from $4.80 late Friday. On the Commodity Exchange,
silver fell 4.5 cents to $4.755 a troy ounce.

   Oil prices shot up Monday in a late rally fueled
by rumors of hostilities in the Persian Gulf, after falling in the
morning on the belief that the Bush-Gorbachev summit made Mideast
war less imminent.
   ``This is such a strange market,'' said Stephen Smith, an
analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co. ``You're down a dollar and a half,
and then you're up a dollar and a half.''
   Light sweet crude closed up $1.26 at $31.30 per barrel for
October contracts in light trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Oil had opened down $1.49 as traders were calmed by the weekend
summit in Helsinki, Finland. President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed that Iraq should get out of Kuwait, but
Gorbachev indicated an unwillingness to resort to a military
solution to the crisis.
   Crude fell another 20 cents before beginning a steady climb in
all contract months.
   Unleaded gasoline and home heating oil also fell in the morning
and rose across the board in the afternoon.
   On October contracts, gasoline closed up 1.50 cents at 94.56
cents per gallon, while home heating oil closed up 1.91 cents at
85.89 cents per gallon
   Natural gas futures were mixed.
   The swings in oil prices sent stocks moving in opposite
directions. The stock market opened higher and closed lower. The
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 30 points at its peak
of the day, finished with a 3.96 loss at 2,615.59.
   After oil opened with its sharp decline, the price began
rebounding on news that Iraq and Iran were re-establishing
diplomatic ties for the first time since their extended war of the
1980s. The conciliatory move was viewed as a bid by Iraq to try
busting the international embargo of its oil that was put in place
after it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The markets paid brief attention to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's announcement that he would provide free oil to Third
World countries as a gesture of good will. But Saddam said the
recipients would have to pick up the oil themselves, which would
force them to get past the U.S. Navy.
   ``When he came out with his statements, they were construed as
bearish,'' said Ed Kevelson, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. ``Initially, he came out with `free oil,' so people said,
`Sell it.' Then they started thinking you had to transport it. That
was pretty much discounted throughout the day as Hussein
gibberish.''
   The late afternoon rally was spurred by rumors that did not turn
out to be valid, according to Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil
analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   ``Some people were trading on a rumor that Iraq had moved troops
into Jordan,'' Hittle said. ``Another rumor was some Saudi rigs
were hit. Another one was some shots were fired.''
   Officials in Washington said there was no information to confirm
any of the rumors.

   A shortage of cash could threaten the
International Cocoa Organization work program proposed Monday by
its chairman, officials from producing and consuming countries said.
   In presenting his program, West Germany's Peter Baron
acknowledged the possible cash shortage by saying the organization
could sell off some of its stockpiled cocoa to finance it.
   Baron's proposal calls for the 41-nation cocoa organization to
concentrate over the next two years on research and development in
cocoa, improving quality and promoting consumption.
   These tasks would give the organization a new role, now that its
old market regulatory powers conferred by the international cocoa
agreement have been officially suspended, he said.
   Members of the organization agreed in March to extend the
international cocoa agreement for two years from Oct. 1, but with a
suspension during this period of its powers to intervene in the
market to regulate supplies and prices.
   The cocoa organization is short of cash because its producing
member countries owe just over $153 million raised from a levy
charged on internationally traded cocoa. The Ivory Coast, the
world's largest producer, is the biggest debtor, owing $87 million.
   The levy of $30 per ton, the organization's only source of
direct funding, was abolished in April.
   According to official calculations, the organization expects to
have $22 million in hand Oct. 1, but will face ordinary
administrative expenses over the next two years of up to $30
million.
   The bulk of the cash is required to finance its stockpile of
250,000 tons of cocoa.
   Member governments agreed in March that if producers did not pay
their debts a limited amount of stockpiled cocoa could be sold to
prevent the organization going into the red in 1990-1992.
   Probably no more than 20,000 tons would have to be sold to fill
any gap in the budget, and that would be too small an amount to
destabilize the market, traders said.
   Baron said no more than 2,000 to 3,000 tons would have to be
sold to finance his proposed work program.
   Cocoa is currently priced at around $1,250 a ton on the world
market.
   Producers and consumers are meeting separately to consider
Baron's plan.
   A decision on whether to endorse it is not expected until
Friday, the final day of the cocoa organization talks here.

   Greyhound Dial Corp. announced Monday it has
purchased the Breck Hair Care Products business from American
Cyanamid Co. of Wayne, N.J.
   The purchase was announced in a news release, but few details
were available beyond a statement that Dial is acquiring more than
300 trademark registrations in 91 countries, approximately 20
patents, inventories and some equipment.
   Breck had 1989 revenues of approximately $60 million and
integrating Breck into Dial will give Phoenix-based Dial annual
sales of more than $1 billion, according to the company.
   ``Breck has been a household name for 60 years,'' said John W.
Teets, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Dial.
   Since 1946, a number of movie stars and models have begun their
careers as ``Breck Girls'' in advertisements, including Brooke
Shields, Jaclyn Smith, Kim Basinger and Cybill Shepherd, the
statement said.
   Breck products are manufactured in seven plants in the United
States, Mexico, Canada and Europe. Dial markets soaps, deodorants,
microwave dinners, canned meats, laundry detergent and other home
cleaning items.

   By the end of the year, Champlin Refining and
Chemicals Inc. will be combined with Tulsa-based Citgo Petroleum
Corp. with total annual revenues of more than $7 billion, their
parent company said.
   The merger, under a restructuring plan to cut costs, should also
produce a refining capacity of 480,000 barrels of oil per day,
according to Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., the national oil company
of Venezuela, which owns the two firms.
   Ronald E. Hall, president and chief executive of Citgo, said in
a statement last week that Citgo's headquarters will remain in
Tulsa.
   Officials of Petroleos de Venezuela said the refining operations
of the national oil company will continue under the Citgo name.
   It isn't clear what effect the move will have on Champlin, based
in Irving, and its 150 employees, a Citgo spokesman said Sunday.
   Citgo has 900 workers in Tulsa and employs about 3,300, with
most workers located at its Lake Charles, La. refinery. The
facility can produce 320,000 barrels per day.
   Champlin employs more than 800 people. Its Corpus Christi
refinery can produce 160,000 barrels per day.
   OPEC members, led by Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, have agreed to
increase oil production to make up the lost oil supplies resulting
from the Persian Gulf crisis.
