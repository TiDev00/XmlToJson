   Columbia's astronauts got a balky
observatory running Tuesday, but missed important targets and had
to revert to manual operations when the star-tracking system failed
to work automatically.
   Astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman did manage to spot the Soviet Mir
space station through binoculars and said it appeared as a small
point of light. Mir was orbiting with five men 32 miles above
Columbia, which is 218 miles above Earth.
   Mission specialist Mike Lounge saw the spacecraft on the next
orbit when Mir was closer. Horizontally, the two spacecrafts came
within about 44 miles of each other Tuesday.
   ``It's extremely frustrating,'' Arthur Davidsen of Johns Hopkins
University, said of the latest problems.
   ``We've got this wonderful instrument ready to go and we're not
getting it pointed at any scientific targets except for brief
glimpses - brief enough to show how great it would be once it locks
on but not long enough to get the science we want to get,'' said
Davidsen, principal investigator for one of the observatory's three
ultraviolet telescopes.
   Earlier Tuesday, NASA officials said the $150 million Astro
observatory aboard the shuttle had been repaired but needed more
adjustments. The instrument pointing system is not expected to be
``100 percent'' for another few days, said mission scientist Ted
Gull.
   ``We're really in a stage where the observatory is starting to
come alive,'' Gull said. ``It's a lot later than where we wanted to
be. But I see no major show-stoppers.''
   More than 10 percent of the approximately 230 telescope
pointings was expected to be lost because of the interruptions in
Astro's round-the-clock observing. Astro was supposed to study
about 250 high-energy objects, including galaxies, quasars, a
supernova and a comet.
   Astronomers, braced for the worst, began the painful process of
removing low-priority targets from the viewing lineup because of
the malfunctions that delayed the 10-day mission's star-gazing.
There was no guarantee, however, that even the most important
objects would be studied in depth.
   The Johns Hopkins telescope, for example, missed two chances
Tuesday to study binary stars in the midst of rare cataclysmic
outbursts because of pointing system problems.
   ``We're tense about progress at the moment,'' Davidsen said.
   NASA had intended to start using the Astro observatory late
Sunday, less than 24 hours into the flight. Those plans were dashed
when the pointing system's star trackers experienced problems
shortly after liftoff.
   The trouble was almost resolved when an on-board computer
crashed Monday night, sending the astronauts and ground teams
``back to square zero,'' said mission manager Jack Jones. It wasn't
until Tuesday morning that the crew reported all three star
trackers seemed to be in good working order.
   Astronaut Ron Parise radioed down that the pointing system
``looks like it's steady as a rock.''
   ``It doesn't mean we can find the fields, but it's a step in the
right direction,'' Parise told ground controllers.
   The astronauts focused Astro's ultraviolet telescopes on the
nearby star Capella in the constellation Auriga, using the pointing
system's automatic mode. But they later had to return to manual
operations - a slow, awkward process - when the system failed to
lock onto a star. Other attempts followed, both manual and
automatic.
   The X-ray observatory, which is operated from the ground and has
its own pointing system, also focused on Capella. It was the first
time the instrument had received X-rays.
   ``The instrument is performing as expected if not better,'' said
NASA scientist Peter Serlemitsos, principal investigator of the
X-ray telescope.
   But later Tuesday night, an axis on the X-ray telescope fell out
of alignment, said NASA spokesman Bob Lessels. Ground controllers
hoped to correct the alignment and get the telescope working again
by early Wednesday.
   Lessels said he did not know what caused the alignment problem.
   Astro is nearly five years late in studying celestial sources of
ultraviolet light and X-rays, which cannot penetrate the atmosphere
and thus are invisible from Earth. The mission was scheduled for
March 1986, but was delayed by the Challenger accident early that
year.
   Four countdowns were halted this year because of shuttle fuel
leaks and a telescope problem before Columbia finally lifted off
Sunday. A Soviet Soyuz rocket blasted into orbit 1{ hours later
with two cosmonauts and a Japanese television reporter, bound for
space station Mir.
   The seven astronauts plan to contact the Mir cosmonauts via ham
radio toward the end of Columbia's mission. Parise, a licensed ham
radio operator, already has communicated with his father in Ohio
and other amateur radio operators.
   On a light note, Mission Control got its first glimpse of a new
trash compactor being used aboard the shuttle. Pilot Guy Gardner
put in a large bag of trash, pumped two handles back and forth, and
then pulled out a smashed bag.
   ``Ta-da,'' Gardner said, displaying the compressed bag before
middeck TV cameras.
   ``It's a little bit different from a household masher, but it's
doing us a lot of good up here,'' said Columbia's commander Vance
Brand.

<HEAD>Airline Comics Get No Mileage Out of Bankruptcy Coincidence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>

   It was natural comedy material, but five
high-flying comics couldn't get any mileage out of it.
   The comedians started entertaining Continental Express
passengers during East Coast flights Monday, the same day
Continental Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection. The comics
shied away from the issue on company orders.
   The comedians working the Newark-to-New Haven, Conn., commuter
flights were told the news of the day and reminded to ``stay away
from inappropriate material,'' Continental spokeswoman Nancy Compel
said Tuesday.
   The promotion was hatched two months ago and will continue
despite the bankruptcy proceedings, she said.
   The comedians were advised last week to keep the cabin humor
clean and not make jokes about airplanes.
   Continental, the nation's fifth-largest airline, said a $2.2
billion debt and higher jet fuel costs because of the Persian Gulf
crisis forced the bankruptcy move.
   Peter Bales of Northport, N.Y., one of comics performing during
the one-week promotion, said the airline's financial troubles were
the least of his worries.
   Turbulence forced the stand-up comedian to deliver his 10-minute
monologue sitting down.
   ``It's difficult to be funny when you're trying not to vomit,''
Bales said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
   He began by warning hecklers they would be asked to leave. Then
he griped about the gig, saying there were ``two guys with
headphones'' in his dressing room.
   The jokes were delivered while he was strapped into his seat. He
craned his head down the aisle to catch a glimmer of response over
the noisy engines.
   ``I thought at one point I got applause,'' he said. ``But I
think my ears were just popping from the pressure.''

<TEXT>
   ``Cheers'' - a rerun, no less - was the most
watched show on television for the eighth time of the 11-week-old
season.
   The barroom comedy, going strong in its ninth season, helped NBC
to an overall rating last week of 13.1. ABC had a 12.4, and CBS a
12.3, the A.C. Nielsen Co. reported Tuesday. Each ratings point
represents 931,000 homes.
   NBC's victory was aided by Sunday's Hallmark Hall of Fame
presentation of ``Decoration Day'' starring James Garner. It
finished seventh.
   CBS' ``60 Minutes'' was No. 2, followed by NBC's ``A Different
World.''
   NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' which suffered its first loss last
week to the animated antics of Fox Broadcasting's ``The Simpsons,''
was back on top.
   Cosby finished fifth, behind ABC's ``ooseanne,'' while a
``Simpsons'' rerun plummeted the cartoon series to 44th place.
   In the prime-time news, ABC and Peter Jennings ranked first with
an 11.7. NBC and Tom Brokaw received a 10.1, and CBS and Dan Rather
a 10.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``Cheers,''
NBC, 20.4; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 19.8; ``A Different World,'' NBC,
18.6; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 18.3; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC, 18.1;
``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS, 18; ``Hallmark Hall of Fame: Decoration
Day,'' NBC, 17.9; ``Murphy Brown,'' CBS, 17.8; ``Empty Nest,'' NBC,

<HEAD>British Author Sends Tennessee Children Offbeat Christmas Poem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roald Dahl, the author of children's
tales and macabre stories, dashed off a humorous poem about that
``good-for-nothing knave'' Santa Claus for a group of Tennessee
schoolchildren not long before he died.
   Dahl, whose stories including ``Charlie and the Chocolate
Factory,'' died Nov. 23 at age 74 at a hospital near his home in
Oxford, England.
   Earlier, teacher Dorothy Hallman's fourth-grade students at
Thrasher Elementary School on Signal Mountain sent him a package of
poems and pictures as a class project.
   In a reply dated November 1990, Dahl wrote:
   ``Hello gorgeous Dorothy and all the clever children at Thrasher
Elementary School who wrote to me. Thank you so much for the lovely
letters and wonderful drawings. There is now only one more shopping
month till Christmas.''
   Dahl then followed with a poem about Christmas that took a
characteristically skewed look at things:
   
   ``Where art thou, Mother Christmas?
   I really wish I knew
   Why Father shouldget all the praise
   And no one mentions you.
   
   ``I'll bet you buy all the presents
   And wrap them large and small
   While all the time the dirty swine
   Pretends he's done it all.
   
   ``So hail to Mother Christmas
   The uncomplaining slave
   And down with Father Christmas
   That good-for-nothing knave.''

<HEAD>165 U.N. Workers Missing or Detained, 10 Killed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONNA BRYSON</BYLINE>

   One day in 1979, Bismillah Kamkai was
taken from his U.N. Development Program office in Kabul,
Afghanistan, under armed guard. He was never heard from again.
   Belay Melake, an Ethiopian statistician working for a U.N.
economic agncy in Addis Ababa, disappeared more than 11 years ago.
His colleagues believe his government tortured and killed him.
   British journalist Alec Collett was abducted south of Beirut in
1985 while on assignment for the United Nations Relief and Works
Agency, which aids Palestinian refugees. In 1986, his kidnappers
claimed to have killed him in retaliation for the U.S. air raid on
Libya, but no body was found.
   U.N. staff members say 10 of their colleagues have been killed,
including Kamkai and Melake. Collett is among 165 listed as missing
or detained around the world.
   Ninety-nine of those detained are Arab relief workers held by
Israeli authorities in the occupied Gaza Strip or West Bank,
according to the U.N. employee union.
   Much attention has focused on Western hostages in the Middle
East, but little has been paid to the scores of detained U.N.
employees. Most are low-level employees of relief and development
agencies who are citizens of the countries where they work.
   ``These people are working for the world community and it's
surprising that there's not more compassion,'' said Lori Berliner,
who for a decade has led a committee of international civil
servants pressing for the release of those detained. ``We worry
about staff being forgotten.''
   Israel accuses the Arab U.N. workers it holds of ``subversive
activities,'' said Lowell Flanders, president of the U.N. staff
union. But he added, ``They're not terrorists.'' Many were
teachers, guards or drivers in Palestinian refugee camps.
   About 20 governments or organizations have been accused of
killing U.N. employees or detaining them illegally. Flanders
described Ethiopia as one of the most serious offenders because of
reports the government has tortured and killed prisoners.
   He said he had independent reports that Ghennet Mebrahtu, a
widow with two children employed by the World Health Organization
in Addis Ababa, had been tortured since her arrest in August.
   An Ethiopian delegate told a U.N. committee in November that
Mrs. Mebrahtu was arrested for activities ``not consistent'' with
her U.N. duties and would be tried soon. He did not elaborate.
   The U.N. staff union insists U.N. workers be afforded due
process: open hearings, written charges and the right to legal
counsel, as provided for in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has demanded
repeatedly that the rights of U.N. staff members be respected.
   ``At a time when the organization is being called upon to
undertake greater responsibilities in various parts of the world,
it is totally unacceptable that ... staff members are subjected to
arbitrary or unexplained detention, abduction, or even have their
lives placed at risk,'' he said recently.
   U.N. committees and member states also have said the matter is
urgent, but the staff union wants action.
   It has demanded a halt to all U.N. activities, except for
humanitarian aid, in any country that illegally detains U.N.
workers. U.N. officials and delegates say there is little chance of
that.
   Mahmoud Tarjouman, a Syrian arrested by his government in 1976
before he could begin work for a U.N. economic commission in
Lebanon, said the United Nations did not work for his release
during nine years of imprisonment.
   No U.N. official ever contacted his wife, and his salary was
stopped after 1{ years, Tarjouman said.
   He said his support for multiparty democracy may have caused his
arrest by President Hafez Assad's government.
   Tarjouman was neither charged or tried, and returned to the
United Nations after his release. He now works as an editor in New
York and U.N. officials are considering his request for ack pay.
   U.N. workers accept that their duties involve risk, Flanders
said, ``but at the same time, they expect that if they do encounter
difficulties, the organization would support them.''
   Reasons for detentions are many.
   Some U.N. workers simply were caught up in unrest. Among the 10
believed slain are Fernando Olivares-Mori and Carmelo Soria
Espinosa, seized in the 1970s in Chile under the military regime of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
   Some may have been victims of attempts to frustrate U.N.
activity. In 1987-1989, the communist government of Nicolai
Ceausescu refused to let a professor working for the United Nations
leave Romania to report on human rights.

<HEAD>EPA Opening Meeting on Health Effects of Passive Smoking</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Hearing begins 9 a.m. EST.</NOTE>

   A tobacco industry spokeswoman defended
cigarette manufacturers' efforts to influence an Environmental
Protection Agency draft report concluding that second-hand smoke
causes cancer in non-smokers.
   ``There has been a lot of involvement by the anti-smoking
community that we don't think should be there,'' said Brennan
Dawson, spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute. ``If you're going to
pursue science, it ought to be without advocacy.''
   An EPA advisory panel today was to hear testimony from the
industry and public health advocates as it begins reviewing the EPA
draft report.
   For three years, the industry and its allies in Congress have
lobbied the EPA at every opportunity to soften or delay that draft
report and two others on passive smoking.
   Documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show
that the industry sent the EPA a mountain of technical information
that dwarfs the EPA's reports and met repeatedly with EPA
scientists and administrators.
   ``They clearly were privy to stuff that was going on that we had
no idea about,'' said Mark Pertschuk, executive director of
Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights in Berkeley, Calif.
   The EPA at the industry's request twice extended the time
allowed for outside comment on draft reports.
   ``No one else was as active in conveying their concerns and
interests,'' said Robert Axelrad, director of the EPA's indoor air
division. He said the agency received ``boxloads'' of material from
the industry.
   Two of the three EPA reports were to be considered: a report
assessing the lung cancer risks associated with passive smoking,
and a workplace policy guide on environmental smoke. The risk
assessment recommends that environmental tobacco smoke be declared
a class A carcinogen - a known cause of human cancer.
   A third EPA report, a compendium of related technical
information on passive smoking, is being revised.
   The stakes for the tobacco industry are enormous.
   ``If second-hand smoke is officially listed as a class A
carcinogen, it is the end of smoking in any public place,'' said
Julia Carol, associate director of Americans for Nonsmokers'
Rights.
   Ms. Dawson of the Tobacco Institute defended the industry's
involvement in the review process. ``What we have tried to do is
stay in the process and do it appropriately and through
conversations with EPA staff,'' she said.
   Two Republicans from the tobacco state of Virginia - Rep. Thomas
Bliley and Sen. John Warner - have written to the EPA expressing
concerns shared by the industry.
   Bliley has repeatedly sought clarification of EPA procedures and
protested the agency's reliance on certain scientists whose work
has found large risks associated with passive smoking.
   Most of the EPA's correspondence with industry representatives
makes clear the industry's comments are welcome.
   In a June 30, 1989, letter, however, an EPA official criticized
the industry for its continued refusal to admit that smoking causes
cancer and other diseases in smokers.
   The industry's argument on passive smoking ``would be more
credible if it were not so similar to the tobacco industry's
position on direct smoking, despite the estimated 50,000 studies
linking smoking with disease in humans,'' wrote William Rosenberg,
an EPA assistant administrator.
   The Tobacco Institute and the two largest tobacco companies,
Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, also have formed a ``media
subcommittee'' to get their message out.
   Three R.J. Reynolds scientists, a company spokeswoman and an
adviser from the public relations firm Hill and Knowlton have been
on the road nearly full-time since Labor Day talking to reporters
and newspaper editorial boards about the EPA reports.

   At last, the purr-fect Christmas stocking
stuffer for indoor cats who have everything. It's their very own
videotape, featuring a mouth-watering parade of live birds,
squirrels and chipmunks cavorting on the TV screen.
   The 25-minute, full-color video, taped in a wooded backyard of
this Washington suburb, is sure to delight all those latchkey
kitties who are bored with napping, scratching the furniture and
swatting ornaments off the Christmas tree.
   Just slip a $19.95 copy of ``Video Catnip'' into the VCR and
watch them turn into regular couch furballs. But heed the warning
at the start of the tape:
   ``While watching this video, your cat may become excited and
attempt to get inside your television set to get at the birds. ...
We strongly suggest that you remove all breakables from on top or
around your TV set. No kitting.''
   Creator Steve Malarkey promises ``some cat-a-clysmic fun with no
paws in the action.'' His satisfied customers, speaking for their
pampered pussycats, say his video really delivers the goods.
   The live action is divided into segments titled ``Cheep
Thrills,'' ``Mews and Feather Report'' and ``A Stalk in the Park.''
Voyeuristic feline viewers will enjoy lots of juicy close-ups of
their favorite outdoor creatures, feasting noisily on birdseed and
popcorn.
   Malarkey was a disgruntled computer technician searching for a
career change when he decided to ``get into the cat business.'' He
tried making heated ``cat houses'' and tree-shaped scratching
posts, but both were flops.
   Then one night, he said, ``I was sitting in front of the TV with
my wife, watching a National Geographic special on birds of the
Cayman Islands or somewhere,'' he said. ```Our cat Stick, who never
even glanced at TV before, came out of his box like a shot and sat
right in front of the screen, growling and meowing.''
   Malarkey borrowed a friend's video camera and tripod, seeded his
backyard with treats and let the tape run for an hour.
   ``When I brought the tape back to the house and showed it to
Stick, he went ballistic,'' Malarkey said. ``He was in front of the
TV, behind the TV, on top of the TV, knocking things over and
swiping at the screen.
   ``My friend showed the tape to his cat, Tigger, who also never
watches TV, and Tigger went absolutely nuts.''
   Bingo!
   Malarkey hired a professional camera crew and doused his
backyard with 200 pounds of birdseed and popcorn. ``It was
springtime, and things were really hopping out there,'' he said.
``By the time the crew arrived, you couldn't see the ground for all
the birds.''
   Can cats really ``see'' a TV video?
   Veterinarians agree with Malarkey that although cats don't
discern shapes and colors as distinctly as humans, they are acutely
aware of moving figures and sounds that excite them.
   Malarkey has sold 7,000 tapes since ``Video Catnip'' appeared on
pet store shelves a little more than a year ago. He's already
planning sequels, with ``bigger birds, bigger squirrels, maybe some
sea gulls thrown in.''
   Human viewers might find ``Video Catnip'' boring after a while.
After all, what's thrilling about watching a pair of blue jays
squabbling? Or a squirrel snitching a peanut from a bowl?
   ``Steven Spielberg it ain't,'' said Malarkey, who now lives in
Morgantown, W.Va., ``but we haven't gotten any complaints yet from
the cats.''

   Iranian veterans of the 1980-88 war with
Iraq say the Americans and their allies cannot expect a short,
quick war if they attack to liberate Kuwait.
   ``The Iraqis can take a great number of casualties and continue
to fight over the corpses of their dead,'' said Col. Amir, an
infantryman who fought in most of the major battles of the gulf
war. Amir refused to be further identified.
   ``If they want to fight the Iraqis, the Americans are going to
have to stomach death,'' he said in an interview.
   ``Most Iraqi soldiers have eight years of real war experience.
The young Americans sent to fight have never seen a battle front,
never killed or been near death,'' he said.
   Some U.S. soldiers in the gulf fought in Panama and Grenada,
both quick campaigns.
   By conservative Western count, there were 1 million casualties
on both sides during the Iran-Iraq war.
   The war ended with a cease-fire in 1988. But peace talks dragged
on until Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, apparently eager to pacify
one front as multinational troops were deployed in response to his
invasion of Kuwait, suddenly acceded to Iranian demands.
   Iran has condemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, but it has
been equally harsh in its criticism of the U.S.-led deployment of
foreign soldiers to the gulf region.
   The Iranians, hard hit by an arms embargo throughout the gulf
war, had to rely on massed infantry attacks with little armor and
artillery and virtually no air cover.
   The Americans and their allies would wage a different kind of
war, pitting their firepower and electronic expertise against
Saddam's numerical strength.
   The United States plans to have 430,000 troops in the Gulf by
January. A total of about 150,000 troops were sent by 27 other
nations.
   Iraq has an estimated 220,000 troops in Kuwait and another
230,000 in southern Iraq near the Kuwait border. Saddam has said
250,000 more men will be sent to Kuwait, a deployment U.S. experts
say could take a month.
   Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati said,
``The Americans will lose on the ground because they don't have
enough troops. I doubt they'll be able to push Iraq out of
Kuwait.''
   Besharati, chief of intelligence for the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps during the war with Iraq, acknowledged that the
Americans will control the skies.
   ``But air power can be used only to support ground forces,'' he
said. ``It doesn't win wars on its own.''
   Alireza, a wartime intelligence officer who refused to be
identified further, said the Iraqis' chemical weapons were ``their
cutting edge.''
   ``They could wipe out large numbers of troops at a time,'' he
said.
   The Americans ``have some elite units who've practiced desert
warfare. Iraq has tens of thousands of soldiers who've actually
fought under those conditions,'' Alireza said.
   ``If the Americans think they can fight a short, quick war,
they're wrong.''

   The Gatlin Brothers - Larry, Steve and Rudy -
are hankering to entertain the troops in the Persian Gulf. But the
country singers found out a lot of other entertainers had the same
idea, and the next available slot is February.
   So the Gatlins are doing the next best thing: sending over a
Christmas special taped in Las Vegas and backed up by an 80-voice
high school choir.
   Larry Gatlin has a soft spot for the thousands of soldiers sent
to Saudi Arabia after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2. His voice broke
as he talked about the possibility that, come February, there may
be no need to entertain the troops.
   ``I hope to God we're out of there by then,'' he said. ``I hope
to God our people don't have to shoot or be shot.
   ``I pray on a daily basis this Saddam fella will come to his
senses. He can make the blood run in the streets if he wans. I
hope he doesn't.''
   But Gatlin isn't all soft spot, as he made clear on the taped
special.
   ``I hope Saddam Hussein does the right thing so we don't have to
open up a shoe store in his rear end,'' he told the audience.

   LONDON (AP) - Just because she lost her job doesn't mean
Margaret Thatcher has lost a friend in Ronald Reagan. And vice
versa.
   The former president and his wife, Nancy, landed at Heathrow
Airport on Monday for a five-day visit to Britain. The Reagans will
lunch on Thursday with Queen Elizabeth II. Later they'll pop in to
see Mrs. Thatcher, who until last week was prime minister.
   Mrs. Thatcher quit as support in her Conservative Party slipped
away. The new prime minister is her protege, John Major.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 65, came to power in 1979. The prime minister and
the president were close allies in their parallel political lives.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Pierce Brosnan, the suave detective in the TV
series ``Remington Steele,'' turned the quill on Hollywood critics
and panned an article that jokingly dismissed his new film.
   Brosnan defended the movie, ``Mr. Johnson,'' in a Los Angeles
Times column Monday, saying his yet-to-be released film directed by
Bruce Beresford should be given a chance.
   ``If any art form ever required an open mind and a closed mouth
until the work had a chance to prove or disprove itself, it is the
motion picture,'' Brosnan wrote.
   He was responding to a recent Times article that reported: ``No
word at all on Bruce Beresfords' `Mr. Johnson' ... but referring to
its setting of road building in West Africa in the 1920s, one
producer quipped: `They ought to put speed bumps in the aisle ...
to prevent people from leaving in droves.'''
   Brosnan said that remark virtually wrote the film's obituary.
   Brosnan noted that Beresford directed such distinguished films
as ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' ``Tender Mercies'' and ``Breaker
Morant.''
   ``Mr. Johnson'' was originally scheduled for a Christmas
release. It will now open in February.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - C.C. DeVille of the rock group Poison was
arrested and jailed for seven hours before giving a concert,
appropriately, at Freedom Hall.
   DeVille, 28, was arrested Saturday at a lounge after jumping on
the hood of a car, police said. The musician was jailed on charges
of alcohol intoxication and criminal mischief.
   The band is on tour promoting their album ``Flesh and Blood.''
   The band will pay for damage to the car, said Scotty Ross,
Poison road manager.
   Dennis Fischer, the lounge's security manager, said DeVille left
the building with the video cameras rolling and sprawled across the
car hood. Then he ``ate some roses'' and ``two or three things got
out of hand,'' Fischer said.
   ``It wasn't nothing you don't see anywhere else in town,''
Fischer said.

<TEXT>
   Two governments made German unity possible this
year, but the united nation's newly elected leadership faces
perhaps an even more daunting task: making it work.
   In the rush to unify, East and West Germany left some of the
most pressing questions for the government that would replace them,
including:
   -How to use, dispose of, analyze or make public the secret files
on 6 million people kept by East Germany's former secret police.
   -How to find and whether to prosecute Communist party
functionaries and police agents blamed for crimes ranging from
corruption to murder.
   -How to sift through the morass of 1 million claims on eastern
German property made by western Germans who used to live in the
region.
   -Whether to move the seat of government to Berlin, the new
capital, or leave it in Bonn.
   The most immediate concern, however, will be dealing with the
mounting costs of unification and the cash drain that former East
Germany has become.
   A day after Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his Christian Democrats
were elected Sunday to lead the united nation, officials of
Germany's central bank gave comments seen as early warning signs
that the costs of unification could hurt the strong German economy.
   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, perhaps the most powerful
man in Germany behind Kohl, said in a Stern magazine interview that
the government's borrowing plans to rebuild the eastern lands could
hurt the economy.
   Poehl said drastic spending cuts were needed to offset the
borrowing.
   The government plans to borrow up to $100 billion in 1991.
   Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank director responsible for
eastern Germany, said officials hadn't understood warnings about
the danger of high government borrowing.
   ``When I look at the planned growth rates of the public budgets
for 1991, I have doubts whether the message has been understood,''
Gaddum said in an interview on Germany's ARD television.
   He said there are worries about ``the ability to finance the
public budgets not only next year but also in the following year.''
   Eastern Germany's teetering economy is expected to crash and
burn in the first three months of next year.
   East Germany was a principal exporter of industrial goods to
other East bloc nations, but many of those contracts expire in
January.
   Economists say some may not be renewed by struggling nations
that find it cheaper to use their nonconvertible currency to buy
goods from Hungary, for example, rather than Germany.
   Likewise, many enterprises are operating on credit that will run
out in the first quarter of next year.
   Joblessness is officially only about 573,000, about 6.1 percent
of the work force. But economists say up to 1 million people now
are carrying around layoff notices that won't kick in until January
or March.
   Joblessness next year may eventually reach 4 million, roughly
half of the work force in the former nation, officials said.
   The new Germany also needs to mesh two sharply different school
systems, apply Western environmental safeguards to one of the
world's most polluted regions, and repair a communications and
transportation system considered crucial to luring new investment
into the east.
   The questions already are beginning to create dissent among the
politicians likely to comprise Kohl's new government.
   The centrist Free Democrats, the junior partner in Kohl's old
government, demanded Monday that eastern German companies pay lower
taxes than their western counterparts.
   Kohl has previously said he opposes such a move, but on Monday
he refused to talk about it to reporters. Kohl needs the Free
Democrats to get a majority in Parliament.
   Kohl, who put a sunny spin on economic questions during the
campaign, was more frank during his first post-election news
conference Monday.
   He said that ``important decisions'' need to be made on ways to
slash government spending and raise further revenues for eastern
Germany.
   Reiterating he would not raise taxes, he did not spell out how
additional revenues would be raised. He called pollution in eastern
Germany an ``especially grave'' problem.
   ``There is a lot to do here,'' he said, a comment that could
refer to German unity in general.

   Several hundred youths set fires, looted businesses
and hurled rocks and bottles at police Monday night after six
police officers were acquitted of most federal civil rights charges
in the beating death of a small-time drug dealer.
   Police said hundreds of people, many wearing masks or paper bags
on their heads, chased after police, looted and set fire to cars,
several stores and an abandoned home in the largely Puerto Rican
neighborhood where Leonardo Mercado was fatally beaten by police in
1988.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries, although several
news photographers said they were roughed up and had their cameras
stolen by bands of youths.
   The riot began at the scene of a rally called to protest the
acquittal of the officers, including blacks, Hispanics and
non-Hispanic whites. Many Puerto Ricans say killing of Mercado, a
Puerto Rican, and later developments demonstrate that mainstream
Miami ignores their problems.
   One youth ran down a street waving a Puerto Rican flag as others
rioted, leaving piles of broken televisions, burned furniture,
shards of glass and about 10 torched or damaged cars in their wake.
   ``This is such hate. Look around. This is hate,'' said Daisy
Perez, 55, the Cuban owner of La Reina Shoe Store and Catholic
Church, where rioters stole shoes, bibles and wooden pews.
``Everything I've got, they've destroyed.''
   By late Monday, police said about 10 arrests had been made.
Asked why police waited for some time before moving in, Miami
police spokesman George Law said, ``It caught us off guard. We had
to assess the situation first.''
   About 200 officers in riot gear and with police dogs closed off
about 10 city blocks and gradually took control of the area as
helicopters flew overhead and smoke billowed from the torched
buildings.
   ``Since we've been bringing in more officers we expect to bring
it under control,'' said Miami Police spokesman Bobby Navarro.
   Mayor Xavier Suarez and Police Chief Perry Anderson met
privately with community leaders to discuss a response to the
violence.
   ``It seems to be some people are upset about the neglect of this
community,'' Suarez said. ``There are many many things we can do.''
   That anger could be heard repeatedly on the streets.
   ``We're looking for justice,'' said 17-year-old Yvette Diaz, a
Puerto Rican. ``We want justice. The other people, the black people
... this is how they did it, and it worked.''
   Earlier Monday, the jury found the officers, members of the
city's elite drug squad, innocent of 17 of the 24 counts, and
reported itself hung on the remaining charges after four days of
deliberations.
   ``This is just what I've been predicting in this case since day
one - that the people would back us,'' said Officer Pablo Camacho,
42, one of the squad's leaders.
   The other defendants were Charlie Haynes, 31, Ronald Sinclair
47, Thomas Trujillo, 33, Nathaniel Veal Jr., 32, and Andy Watson,
33.
   All six were undercover officers with the Street Narcotics Unit,
often called the ``jump-out squad,'' which is charged with cleaning
up drugs in Miami.
   The officers were charged in the Dec. 16, 1988, beating death of
the 35-year-old Mercado. They were accused of stomping on him,
pummeling him, smashing him in the head with a flashlight or
nightstick and then lying about it to investigators.
   Acquittals in police killings have touched off five riots in
Miami in the last decade, most recently in 1989 when a Hispanic
police officer's shooting of a black motorcyclist set off three
days of rioting.
   The violence Monday night did not appear to be race-related
since blacks, Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites were among the
officers on trial; the victim also was Hispanic.
   The government has until Jan. 17 to decide whether to refile the
charges, but Anderson said the six would be allowed to return to
their jobs.
   ``We feel the officers have done what was necessary under the
system,'' Anderson said. ``We plan on bringing them back to work as
expeditiously as possible.''
   The men faced charges of civil rights murder and conspiracy in
Mercado's death. They also were charged with civil rights
violations by causing bodily harm to two teen-age boys who regarded
the slain drug dealer as their stepfather.
   The officers were cleared of the conspiracy charge and one of
the two assault charges against the boys, and all but Veal were
acquitted on the other assault count. The jury was hung on that
count for Veal, as well as in the actual murder count for all six
defendants.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said after the verdict that the
civil-rights murder count ``was the core of the indictment,'' but
added his office had not yet determined if it will pursue that
count.
   One of Mercado's stepsons, Pedro Soto, was angry as he emerged
from the federal courthouse.
   ``I expected justice to be done here this afternoon, and I see
there wasn't no justice,'' said Soto, whose family has filed a $10
million damage suit against the officers.
   The officer's lawyers argued that they were just doing their
jobs and protecting themselves. Attorney Milt Hirsch said during
the trial that it was ``kill or be killed.''
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Dan Gelber argued that police cannot
use the drug war to excuse criminal behavior.
   The prosecution maintained in the case that the police went
looking for Mercado, a crack dealer, after hearing of a threat
against Camacho's life. The police confronted Mercado outside his
apartment, marched him inside and beat him to death, authorities
said.
   Among the witnesses were Mercado's 15-year-old girlfriend and
Mercado's two stepsons. All three testified about alleged assaults
on Mercado. One of the boys said an officer hurled him through a
window.

<HEAD>Agriculture Researchers Test New Weapon in War Against Weevils</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Take one broomstick, one ordinary aluminum pan
and a few drops of what Agriculture Department researchers call
``sex attractant.''
   What have you got? Well, just add insecticide, a plastic cap and
a lime-green coating and you come out with what researchers call a
lethal new weapon in agriculture's long-running war against the
boll weevil.
   It may not look like much, but developers say their new
broomhandle bait stick will deliver a lopsided kill ratio in the
fight against the hated arch-enemy of America's cotton producers.
   ``It's a simple concept, really, but represents putting together
findings from 30 years of research on boll weevil behavior,'' says
USDA research scientist Gerald H. McKibben.
   In Mississippi fields where the device is being tested for the
second year, scientists are finding 70 percent fewer weevils, he
says.
   And one of the glories being claimed is that the homely looking
implement uses just one gram of insecticide an acre, 100 times less
than usual. Backers say it could gain support from consumerists who
wince at hosing down farm fields with chemicals in the fight
against insects and other pests.
   ``It's possible that the bait stick idea could be used for other
insect pests on other crops in the future,'' McKibben says. ``But
we have to test that further.''
   McKibben developed the stick at the Agricultural Research
Service Boll Weevil Laboratory in Starkville, Miss. Testing is also
in progress in Texas.
   McKibben says his agency has signed contracts with two private
firms to improve the device for commercial use.
   It is made by thrusting the broomstick through the center of a
foil-like aluminum pie pan and driving one end of the stick into
the ground. The pan, with its interior facing up, rides halfway up
the stick.
   The stick is topped with a lime-green plastic cap covered with
insecticide, a feeding stimulant and a chemical called grandlure.
   Scientists say grandlure is highly effective as a sex attractant
for weevils. And for some reason lime green seems to be their
favorite color. But when the critters pay a visit to the cap they
get a nasty dose of insecticide and fall dead into the pan.
   Since the insecticide is on the cap, it stays out of the soil
and ground water.
    lime-green compound that kills weevils has also been painted
on the side of the stick. A patent has been filed for both the
coating and the cap.
   Before he was through last year, McKibben was finding 200 to 300
dead weevils a day in his pans, agriculture officials say.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Agriculture Department forecasters say final
figures will show strong vegetable production in 1990, exceeding
the trend of the last decade and a half for the second straight
year.
   Processing tomato and fresh onion crops appear destined to set
production records while the dry edible bean crop is likely to come
in just short of a record, according to latest figures from USDA's
Economic Research Service.
   Fall potato and sweet potato output also are on their way to
posting increases, forecasters say. They say increases in these
crops account for the bulk of the gain in overall vegetable
production over last year's level.
   Farmers expanded acreage planted in potatoes this year and thus
boosted the crop 6 percent over last year's level of 370.4 million
hundredweight.
   Dry edible bean production should end the year at 32 million
hundredweight, 33 percent above the 1990 level but 1 percent below
1981.
   Vegetable growers were hammered by a hard freeze early in the
1990 season. It was especially tough on Florida's tomato crop.
Growers replanted, though, and by spring ideal conditions were
hurrying an unusually abundant crop to market. That sent prices
down, at times below the costs of picking and packing, and there
were reports of tomatoes left in fields.
   The outlook for next season is for stronger supplies and prices
generally below a year earlier for the crops.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Supermarkets continue to have the largest
share of the nation's retail food sales, new Agriculture Department
figures show.
   Supermarkets constitute only about 10 percent of the stores
selling food around the country but have 70 percent of the sales,
said a report from USDA's Economic Research Service.
   The reason for the dominance of supermarkets is that they deal
in high volume, the report says. It also says supermarkets are
unlikely to remain unchanged as consumer trends already evident
intensify.
   Forecasters say the supermarket will become provide an
increasing number of goods and services to meet consumer demand for
speed and convenience and soon may be serving dinner right at the
store.

<HEAD>Ruling Seen a Deterrent to Police Coercion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court ruling reinforcing the right
of criminal suspects to legal representation is an important
deterrent to police coercion, the lawyer who won the case says.
   ``I view the opinion as a significant reaffirmation of the
rights'' of the accused, said attorney Floyd Abrams, who handled
the appeal of Mississippi death row inmate Robert S. Minnick.
   ``I'm not surprised the court has determined that after someone
in custody requests counsel that counsel must be present at all
subsequent interrogations,'' Abrams said.
   By a 6-2 vote Monday, the justices overturned Minnick's murder
conviction because police questioned the suspect without his lawyer
present.
   The court said that unless a previously questioned suspect asks
to talk to police, they may not renew questioning in the absence of
his lawyer - even after the suspect and attorney have conferred.
   The high court previously had barred police from resuming the
questioning of a suspect who asks to see a lawyer for the first
time, unless the suspect initiates the conversation.
   The court's dissenters said the ruling protects the guilty and
unduly hamstrings police.
   The Justice Department, which had urged the court to uphold
Minnick's conviction, declined comment on the ruling.
   In other actions Monday, the Supreme Court:
   -Agreed to use a case from Florida to decide whether police who
have an owner's permission to search a car must get a court warrant
before opening any containers inside the vehicle.
   -Shielded businesses from some big-money lawsuits filed by
employees claiming they were fired so their employers would not
have to pay pension benefits. The court ruled unanimously that
fired employees may sue in federal court, but not in state courts
for potentially larger punitive damages.
   -Ruled by a 5-3 vote in a case from Pennsylvania and Virginia
that a federal anti-counterfeiting law may be used to crack down on
the sale of used cars with phony mileage readings.
   The Mississippi confession case provided at least a mild
surprise in that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the court's
opinion.
   Kennedy dissented in 1988 when the court threw out a burglary
conviction because police questioned a suspect who had invoked his
right to a lawyer. The issue in that case was whether the suspect
could be quizzed about a crime other than the one for which he was
arrested.
   But on Monday, Kennedy said, ``Whatever the ambiguities of our
earlier cases on this point, we now hold that when counsel is
requested, interrogation must cease, and officials may not
reinitiate interrogation without counsel present, whether or not
the accused has consulted with his attorney.''
   The decision relied largely on a 1981 high court ruling that
barred police from reinitiating questioning of a suspect who has
asked for but not yet talked to a lawyer. Monday's ruling extends
that protection to instances in which a suspect already has
conferred with an attorney.
   Kennedy said the purpose of both rulings is to discourage police
from badgering a defendant into giving up the right to a lawyer
provided by the court's landmark Miranda ruling in 1966.
   But Justice Antonin Scalia, in a dissenting opinion joined by
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, called the ruling a
``misguided'' expansion of constitutional rights that will
discourage ``an honest confession.''
   The ruling produces ``a veritable fairyland castle of imagined
constitutional restriction upon law enforcement,'' Scalia said.
   Justice David H. Souter did not take part in the case.

<HEAD>Cheney Increases Reservist Callup Authorizations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is raising the
ceiling on the number of military reservists who can be ordered
into uniform for the Persian Gulf crisis to near the current legal
limit of 200,000.
   The Pentagon announced Monday that Cheney increased by 63,000
the maximum number of Army, Navy and Marine Corps reservists who
can be ordered to active duty for Operation Desert Shield. It said
he signed the order on Saturday.
   The new limit is 188,000 for all services, although the Air
Force and Coast Guard totals were not changed. On Nov. 14, Cheney
had raised the overall ceiling from 50,000 to 125,000.
   A total of 96,834 members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine
Corps and Coast Guard reserves and National Guard are on active
duty under call-up authority granted by President Bush on Aug. 23.
Thousands more have been alerted to prepare to mobilize.
   The Pentagon gave no reason for increasing the callup limit.
Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made a
pitch for the reservists in congressional testimony Monday. He said
their participation in Desert Shield ``has been a significant
factor in affording us flexibility and balance.''
   The current callup of reserves is the first since the Vietnam
war and the largest since the 1961 crisis triggered by East
Germany's construction of the Berlin Wall.
   Cheney's latest order means the Pentagon may approach the legal
limit for reserve activations. Short of declaring war or a national
emergency the president is limited to authorizing the callup of
200,000 reservists.
   The secretary's move also indicates that the services are
relying much more on reserve manpower to fill out a second wave of
troop deployments to the Persian Gulf than they did in an initial
deployment of 240,000 air, ground and sea forces.
   When Bush announced Nov. 8 that he had ordered large
reinforcements sent to the gulf to augment the approximately
230,000 personnel then in the area, fewer than 50,000 reservists
had been put on active duty. Most were in support roles to provide
sealift and airlift of troops and supplies, as well as medical
service.
   Of the increases in authorized callups for the four services,
the biggest is for the Army. Cheney raised its limit to 115,000
from 80,000. But the largest proportional increase is for the Navy,
whose limit triples from 10,000 to 30,000. Up to now the Navy has
put 6,182 reservists on active duty for Desert Shield.
   The Navy public affairs office said it could not immediately
explain the reason for the large increase.
   The limit for the Marines was raised from 15,000 to 23,000. The
Air Force ceiling remains at 20,000 and there is no change in the
Coast Guard limit of 1,250.

   The deteriorating economy is hitting consumers
in Northeastern states hardest, according to loan delinquency data
for the July-September quarter.
   Nationally, the percentage of consumer loans 30 or more days
delinquent was a seasonally adjusted 2.56 percent at the end of the
third quarter, virtually unchanged from the 2.55 percent rate at
the end of the April-June period, the American Bankers Association
said Monday.
   The rate was 2.46 percent at the end of the first quarter of
1990 and 2.64 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 1989.
   However, the lack of movement masked sharp variations among
regions.
   The top five delinquency rates were New Hampshire, 6.12 percent;
Connecticut, 5.53 percent; Puerto Rico, 5.18 percent;
Massachusetts, 4.85 percent; and West Virginia, 4.34 percent.
Rounding out the top 10 were New York, Rhode Island, Maine, Alabama
and New Jersey.
   Delinquency rates were lowest in Arizona, 1.27 percent;
Nebraska, 1.33 percent; South Dakota, 1.34 percent; Colorado, 1.56
percent; and Minnesota, 1.62 percent. The rest of the bottom 10
were Tennessee, Washington, North Carolina, California and Idaho.
   Robert H. Dugger, chief economist of the banker's group, said
the survey, combined with other data, indicates consumers
nationally continued to pay their bills in the third quarter but
were scaling back borrowing as the economy headed into what many
analysts say is a recession.
   ``Consumers are well aware of the slowing economy and are making
efforts to consolidate and repay debts, rather than take on new
ones,'' Dugger said.
   Government data shows consumers are taking fewer loans, he said,
while anecdotal evidence from bankers indicates that financially
stronger households may be taking out less expensive and
longer-term home equity loans in order to pay off other consumer
loans and reduce their monthly payments.
   Dugger said he expected the number of consumers behind on loan
payments to be higher when figures are reported for the final three
months of this year.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said the economy
slipped into a ``meaningful downturn'' in October, the result of
higher oil prices and shaken consumer confidence stemming from
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Michael K. Evans, a Washington economic consultant, said
consumer loan delinquencies generally do not rise significantly
until well into a recession.
   ``Consumers haven't been too hard hit yet,'' Evans said. ``I
don't think gasoline prices have that big of an impact. ... I don't
want to say it doesn't hurt at all, but people are taking it in
stride. They're cutting into their savings on the grounds that it's
just temporary.''
   The delinquency rate includes seven different types of
closed-end consumer loans: personal, two types of auto loans,
mobile home, recreational vehicle, property improvement and second
mortgages.
   The rate for open-ended home equity lines of credit, which are
tracked separately, edged up from 0.75 percent in the second
quarter to 0.8 percent in the third.
   The banking group surveyed 800 commercial banks, tracking loans
in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.

   Federal safety experts have warned for years
that runway collisions like the one that killed eight people at
Detroit are a rising danger at increasingly congested U.S.
airports.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, frustrated that many
of its key accident-prevention recommendations have never been
implemented, voted in October to give the runway collision issue
added urgency by placing it high on its list of ``most wanted''
safety improvements.
   ``It is a serious problem,'' said safety board spokesman Mike
Benson after Monday's runway collision of two Northwest Airlines
passenger jets, a DC-9 and a 727, at Detroit Metropolitan Airport.
   ``We've said it's serious,'' Benson said. ``That's why we've
made that safety area one of our `most wanted' recommendations.''
   According to government figures, the nation's airports reported
382 runway incursions in 1987 - incidents where an airplane taxied
onto a runway without authorization from aircraft controllers, or
because of confusion in interpreting instructions. The number of
incidents declined to 190 in 1988, but they have been increasing
since then.
   Aviation's worst disaster was just such an on-the-ground
accident. Two Boeing 747s, one operated by Pan Am and the other by
the Dutch airline KLM, collided on a foggy runway at Tenerife in
the Canary Islands on March 27, 1977.
   The collision of the jumbo jets killed 581 people.
   In the Detroit accident, visibility at Metropolitan Airport was
poor and the ground was wet from a morning snow and sleet storm
that delayed flights.
   Tony Dresden, a spokesman for the National Air Traffic
Controllers' Association, a union representing air controllers,
said preliminary reports from Detroit controllers indicated that
``the DC-9 pilot became lost on the runways.''
   ``The pilot gave the ground controller erroneous information
about his position and turned right onto the runway where the 727
was taxiing,'' Dresden said. ``The DC-9 pilot discovered at the
very last moment where he was, and so the ground controller told
him to immediately get off that runway, but it was too late.''
   The FAA, which oversees the nation's air traffic control system,
had no immediate comment on Dresden's statement.
   A runway collision can have catastrophic effects since departing
aircraft - such as the two Northwest jetliners at Detroit - are
likely to be fully oaded with highly flammable jet fuel.
   The safety board first addressed the runway incursion issue
after three near-misses by aircraft rolling down airport runways
between June 1978 and February 1979.
   In 1986, the safety board asked the FAA to implement these
measures:
   -Require air traffic controllers to get confirmation from
pilots, in the form of reading back instructions they receive from
the tower, of all hold, takeoff or crossing clearances and all
clearances for access onto an active runway.
   -Revise and enforce requirements to investigate and report
operational or pilot errors that lead to runway incursions and to
attempt to learn how and why they occur.
   -Determine the most effective signs, markings and procedures to
prevent ``pilot induced'' runway incursions.
   The FAA said in April it was considering the read-back
requirement.
   The safety board investigates all major transportation accidents
involving U.S. carriers, setting a probable cause for each. A team
of investigators was dispatched hours after the Detroit accident.
   The board investigates about 2,500 accidents a year and has
issued nearly 8,200 safety recommendations since its creation in
1967. Since it has no enforcement powers it can only recommend that
safety improvements be made.
   The board's ``most wanted'' list of such proposed improvements
include recommendations involving cruise ships, fishing boats,
automobile accidents, truck safety and pipelines as well as several
in the field of aviation.

   Richard Berendzen, who quit as president of
American University before pleading guilty to making obscene
telephone calls, will return to teaching at the school after more
than a year on paid administrative leave.
   Berendzen will resume his duties as a full professor of physics
in the spring of 1992, interim President Milton Greenberg said
Monday.
   ``I have assured Dr. Berendzen that The American University
community stands ready to assist him in his return to faculty
status,'' Greenberg said in a written statement. ``In reaching this
agreement, Dr. Berendzen has assured me of his continued desire for
harmony within our university.''
   Berendzen told the university in June he wanted to return to his
teaching position, but was told some in the school would not
welcome him back. At that point, he said, his attorneys started
negotiating a buyout of his contract.
   News that the university was ready to offer him $1 million led
to protests by campus groups. Greenberg asked trustees to rescind
any such offer because it was causing ``serious rifts.''
   Berendzen will return as a regular tenured faculty member in the
physics department with normal teaching duties, Greenberg's
statement said.
   ``He will be paid at a salary appropriate to his faculty rank.
He will be on administrative leave with pay, at his faculty salary,
for the 1990-91 academic year and the fall 1991 semester,'' the
statement said.
   University Vice President Don Triezenberg told The Washington
Post that the salary was in the $70,000 range. The agreement,
subjected to approval by university trustees, also includes
presidential severance pay reportedly totaling $380,000.
   Berendzen was given two 30-day jail sentences by a Fairfax
County, Va., judge in May after pleading guilty to two misdemeanor
counts of making obscene calls to a woman. The jail terms were
suspended pending completion of psychiatric treatment Berendzen
agreed to continue. He had quit as president abruptly in April.
   The trustees will hear testimony from students, faculty members
and administrators before acting on the agreement, said a student
group, ``Wanted: A Voice,'' that had argued for open discussion of
the matter.

<HEAD>Justice Department Opposes Return of Some CNN Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department argues that documents
Cable News Network wants returned may become evidence in the
investigation of the leak of Manuel Noriega's taped prison
telephone calls.
   The court filing by the department on Monday did not say how the
15 documents might be such evidence.
   The documents include a list of telephone numbers apparently
compiled by CNN reporter Marlene Fernandez, the Justice Department
said.
   CNN's Nov. 8 broadcast about Noriega's conversations with his
attorneys and others from a federal prison near Miami triggered a
legal dispute over the network's right to air the tapes.
   The Supreme Court last month upheld a federal judge's temporary
order barring CNN from airing any tapes of conversations between
the deposed Panamanian dictator and his lawyers pending a court
review of the material.
   Last week, the temporary ban was lifted by William M. Hoeveler,
the judge who is presiding over Noriega's drug conspiracy case in
Miami.
   CNN, which played a segment of one conversation in defiance of
Hoeveler's order, has so far not aired any other conversations.
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, is conducting a criminal
investigation into the theft of the tapes, which defense lawyers
say compromised Noriega's ability to get a fair trial.
   In its filing Monday in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, the
Justice Department opposed a motion by CNN for the return of the 15
documents that FBI agents kept following a search of a box
containing material used by Ms. Fernandez in preparing her
broadcasts.
   The box was found abandoned Nov. 12 in a room at the Omni Hotel
and turned over to the hotel's lost and found department.
   The Justice Department noted that it had returned all the other
items in the box to CNN, including 52 documents and five videotape
cassettes labeled ``Noriega Tapes.''
   Copies of the 15 documents the FBI agents kept have also been
furnished to CNN lawyers, the Justice Department said.
   ``All of these 15 documents relate to the FBI's investigation
into the theft of government property,'' the department said in its
brief.
   FBI agent Jeffrey B. Lang said in an affidavit attached to the
pleadings that ``it is entirely likely that in any subsequent
prosecution, the items may well be introduced into evidence.''
   Besides a piece of paper marked ``telephone numbers,'' the
seized material includes a ``Noriega Tapes'' script, several sets
of Noriega transcripts and descriptions of recordings.

   Nine of 10 Americans approve of President
Bush's offer to send Secretary of State James A. Baker III to
Baghdad for talks with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, but most
don't think it will do any good, according to a Washington Post-ABC
News poll.
   The poll released Monday also found that 69 percent approved of
the United Nations resolution authorizing use of military force if
Iraq does not withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   While 90 percent of the 758 adults selected at random for the
poll said they supported the decision to send Baker to Baghdad, 53
percent said they didn't think it would do any good.
   In offering to send his secretary of state to talk to the Iraqi
president, Bush also invited Saddam to send his foreign minister to
Washington for talks.
   The poll also showed that overall support for Bush's handling of
the Persian Gulf crisis was at 61 percent, roughly the same as that
found in polls in November and October but well below the 78
approval rating he got in September.
   The poll was conducted by telephone last Friday and Saturday and
has a likely margin of uncertainty of 4 percentage points either
way.

   The dollar gained ground further against the
Japanese yen Tuesday, while share prices fell sharply.
   The dollar closed at 134.35 yen, up 1.35 yen from Monday's close
of 133.00 yen. After opening at 134.33 yen, the currency ranged
between 133.50 yen and 134.55 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 863.38
points, or 3.80 percent, closing at 21,862.61. The index gained
271.36 points on Monday.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds slipped to 86.68, down from Monday's
close of 86.81. Their yield rose to 7.345 percent from 7.315
percent.
   Currency traders said the dollar's strength followed its advance
Monday in New Yrk, where it closed at 134.73 yen, up from 132.50
late Friday.
   ``The dollar traded around 134 yen, though profit-taking and
selling by exporters prodded the currency slightly lower,'' a
dealer with Tokai Bank said.
   Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities, said the dollar is expected soon to reach the 135-yen
level with annual dollar demand in December from travelers and
trading houses.
   Kanai cited comments from Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on
Monday expressing pessimism about the effectiveness of economic
sanctions against Iraq as yet another factor prompting the dollar's
strength.
   News indicating continuing tensions in the Persian Gulf
generally prompts buying of the dollar, which is seen as a safe
investment in times of international crisis.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started lower as investors
were discouraged by the declining yen and bond prices. A decline in
Japan's auto sales also hurt stocks, said Koji Shimazu of Universal
Securities.
   The Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said Monday that sales
of cars, trucks and buses fell 2.3 percent in November from the
same month of 1989, the first such decline in 21 months.

   LBJ did it. Lloyd Bentsen did it. Why, asks a
Connecticut lawmaker, shouldn't any Capitol Hill mogul be able to
seek the White House without risking hard-won legislative clout?
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said Monday he will introduce a
bill next month to let House members and senators run for president
and still appear on the ballot for their legislative jobs.
   The bill would adopt nationally the essence of a Texas law
designed for Lyndon Johnson and used by Lloyd Bentsen in 1988 to
ensure he could run for vice president without giving up his Senate
seat.
   Texas is the only state with such a law, Gejdenson said.
   ``It shouldn't just be Texans who have the opportunity to run
for re-election and president simultaneously,'' Gejdenson said.
``And the country shouldn't be put in the position where a person
of that experience should either remove himself from office or stay
as majority leader or minority leader or committee chairman.''
   Republicans viewed the legislation as a thinly veiled bid to
widen the field of possible challengers against President Bush in
1992.

   About 88 Americans remain hostage in Iraq
after the release of 15 others last weekend, the State Department
says.
   The 15 Americans, all of whom had been held as ``human shields''
at strategic sites in Iraq, left the country in the company of
former boxing champion Mohammed Ali.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the department spokeswoman, said Monday that
10 of the 15 people who flew out of Baghdad on Saturday had special
medical conditions. Once in Amman, Jordan, the group broke up, with
six planning to fly to New York late Monday. The others went on to
Amsterdam, Netherlands and then to the United States.
   Tutwiler said six Americans in Baghdad are visited regularly at
the Mansour Melia Hotel by U.S. embassy officials.
   Tutwiler also said the United States has not received any
additional information about Americans in Kuwait being rounded up
over the weekend. But she said house-to-house searches in Kuwait
continue.

<HEAD>Ricks: America Is Headed For Brain Drain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading engineer says America must get
serious about science or accept a generation of fast-food workers
who don't need to know anything more than how to operate
foreign-made cash registers.
   ``We need to think about the workforce of tomorrow,'' Leonard
Ricks told a NASA advisory committee Monday. ``Are we to condemn
our young people to a future of employment in fast food chains? If
so, they do not need an education to operate the foreign made
computers that show the pictures of burgers, fries and milkshakes,
eliminating the need for employees who read.''
   He said an American brain drain looms because of a poor
atmosphere for creative technology and an aggressive engineer
recruiting program by foreign companies.
   ``Our members are asking themselves what future is there for the
American aerospace worker,'' Ricks testified. ``Unfortunately, many
of our colleagues are concluding that there is no future and are
leaving.''
   He spoke at the sixth and last hearing of the Advisory Committee
on the Future of the U.S. Space Program, which is preparing to
issue a final report on Dec. 17. The committee was set up in July
by NASA administrator Richard Truly.
   Ricks, executive director for the Council of Engineers and
Scientists Organizations, said public policy has focused on the
management of the nation's space program but not the creators of
technology and said focus on NASA's problems has created a
witchhunt atmosphere.
   ``Today there is a feeding frenzy over many of the technical
difficulties that naturally occur in any complex scientific
endeavor,'' he said. ``Both the print and electronic media have
appeared jubilant over flaws in the Hubble (Space Telescope)
mirror, fuel leaks and other technical problems.''
   That, in turn, has produced an enormous morale problem in the
aerospace workforce, said Ricks, whose organization represents more
than 100,000 engineers.
   ``We are increasingly made to feel embarrassed by public policy
makers who see our programs as wasting money that could be spent in
meeting social needs. We are humiliated by the media's presentation
of our products as inferior and flawed.''

send 10,000 tons of rice to help alleviate food problems in the
Soviet Union, according to news reports today.
   Pakistan was responding to a United Nations plea for emergency
food aid for the Soviet Union, the independent English-language
Muslim newspaper said.
   ``The donation is being made as a gesture of good will,'' Sartaj
Aziz, Pakistan's Finance Minister was quoted as telling a news
conference Monday.
   Pakistan and the Soviet Union have been on opposite sides of
Afghanistan's civil war since the Soviet Army intervened to fight
Moslem guerrillas in December 1979.
   The country has been the conduit for billions of dollars in U.S.
and Arab aid to the guerrillas. More than 3.8 million Afghan
refugees live in Pakistan.
   In 1989, the Soviet Union pulled its troops from Afghanistan,
but Moscow continues to ship about $500 million a month in food and
materiel to support the government of President Najibullah.
   Many Soviet cities are running low on food because of
distribution bottlenecks and bureaucratic disputes associated with
the deterioration of central authority.

   The kiddie comedy ``Home Alone'' packed them
in at the movie theaters last weekend for first place with $14.4
million.
   In second at the box office was ``Misery'' with $10.1 million,
Exhibitor Relations Co. said Monday. Rob Reiner's adaptation of the

<HEAD>Panamanian Attorney General Seeks Noriega Extradition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALINA GUERRERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judicial authorities have requested
the extradition of Gen. Manuel Noriega to stand trial in this
country for murdering the leader of an attempted coup against the
former Panamanian ruler.
   Noriega, in a Miami prison facing trial on U.S. drug trafficking
charges, is sought in Panama in the murder of Maj. Moises Giroldi,
government prosecutor Danilo Montenegro told a news conference
Monday.
   ``The district attorney asked the Foreign Ministry for his
extradition,'' said Attorney General Rogelio Cruz. It wasn't known
whether the request had yet been conveyed to the United States.
   Noriega's defense attorney in Miami is seeking to have the drug
charges dropped on the grounds that secret taping of
attorney-client conversations and a dispute over Noriega's legal
fees have ruined Noriega's chances of a fair trial.
   Giroldi led an aborted uprising against Noriega in October 1989,
two months before the United States invaded Panama and ousted the
former dictator.
   Prosecutor Nelson Rovetto said Giroldi, who surrendered after
the coup failed, was among nine men executed on Oct. 3 and 4, 1989,
near Albrook Field, a U.S. air station in downtown Panama City.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said later that he had received
reports Noriega personally executed Giroldi.
   Cruz said at least seven Noriega allies, agents of the defunct
Panama Defense Forces, are also implicated in the killings.
   Panama also filed a $6.5 billion racketeering lawsuit against
Noriega in Miami U.S. District Court last month.
   The lawsuit says Noriega participated in assassination, torture,
drug trafficking, money laundering, embezzlement, sale of visas and
passports and other abuses while he was head of the Defense Forces.
   Prosecutor Cecilia de Martinez said authorities have reopened
several murder cases that are linked to officials or cronies of
Noriega.
   She accused investigators under the former regime of
``complicity'' in scuttling probes.
   ``We can't explain why authorities let a lot of things go by,''
she said.
   Prosecutor Carlos Herrera said former military officers would go
on trial next year for the 1985 murder and decapitation of Noriega
opponent Hugo Spadafora. A total of 25 people are implicated in the
murder, Herrera said.
   Panama has also asked Costa Rica to extradite former Maj.
Rogelio Morales to stand trial for the 1971 killing of university
student Jorge Camacho, de Martinez said.

<HEAD>Hearings Begin on Trump Taj Mahal Financial Stability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY STERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump's struggling Taj Mahal
can achieve the stability it needs to keep its casino license,
Trump executives say.
   Improved slot results and a restructuring of $675 million in
debt will help stabilize the gaming hall's finances, the executives
argued Monday at a hearing before the Casino Control Commission on
the 8-month-old jewel in Trump's crown.
   Atlantic City's biggest casino is undergoing restructuring that
lowered the interest rate on its debt and gave Trump's creditors a
50 percent stake in the gaming hall. But the deal will also
temporarily throw it into bankruptcy court.
   If the commission concludes that the casino is financially
unstable, it could lift its license and appoint a conservator to
operate it.
   ``I think we've got a reasonable interest rate. I think frankly,
we've got a wonderful property,'' Trump Organization chief
financial officer Stephen Bollenbach testified.
   ``It's hard to imagine a set of circumstances where there would
not be enough cash flow to make bond payments.''
   Trump did not attend the hearing.
   The commission said it will hold more hearings Dec. 12 and 19 as
details of the restructuring plan become final and will make a
ruling after Dec. 19.
   ``The commission will be prepared to do whatever it deems
necessary to protect the public interest,'' warned chairman Steve
Perskie.
   Bollenbach and Ed Tracy, president of Trump's Atlantic City
holdings, blamed the casino's problems on the recession in the
Northeast and its failure to capture enough of the slot machine
market.
   The Taj will use a free coin program to boost its slot
operations, which have yet to recover since change machines broke
down during the opening, Tracy said.
   The hearing came three weeks after Trump renegotiated the $675
million in debt borrowed to finance his third casino here. He
reached the restructuring agreement one day after failing to make a
$47.3 million interest payment.
   The state Division of Gaming Enforcement did not disagree with
the observations of Trump's executives but said the Taj Mahal's
lagging slot performance and a weakening casino industry were cause
for concern.
   The division regulators said it was still too early to assess
the restructuring deal's prospects.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military rebellion that
turned parts of Buenos Aires into a battleground two days before
President Bush is to arrive was Argentina's fourth since 1987, and
may have been the least effective.
   Challenged immediately by the air and armored power of loyalist
troops, Monday's was the shortest and bloodiest of the four
revolts. At least 13 people were killed and about 60 wounded.
   In Brazil, Bush said he would go ahead with the scheduled state
visit.
   While earlier barracks rebellions forced shake-ups in the high
command and bigger service budgets, this time ``surrender was
unconditional,'' President Carlos Menem said Monday night about 18
hours after the insurrection began.
   Menem said that not only will his military policy remain
unchanged, but rebel leaders may face the death penalty. ``The
military code of justice contemplates that possibility. The full
measure of law will be applied.''
   Unlike the upheavals in April 1987 and January and December
1988, loyalist troops showed little reluctance in firing on fellow
soldiers.
   The loyal troops used aerial bombing, tanks, mortars and
high-caliber machine guns against rebel-held installations. Just
before nightfall, heavily armed troops surrounded army
headquarters, the last rebel stronghold.
   About 120 rebels gave up after air force jets buzzed the
headquarters building in downtown Buenos Aires, two blocks from
Government House, where Menem works and from which he directed the
counterattack.
   Hours earlier, rebels at Palermo infantry base five miles away
surrendered, as did rebels at a tank factory in Boulogne, 16 miles
to the northwest.
   In all, about 450 mutinous soldiers and civilian rebels
surrendered, army officials said. Others who fled from Boulogne and
from wrecked tank columns were being sought. Among the arrested was
rebel leader Col. Enrique Baraldini.
   The insurgents' final hope had been two columns of tanks that
were knocked out of commission by air force bombing.
   ``The triumph of the armed forces was absolute,'' Menem told a
televised news conference.
   The disturbances began before dawn, when rebels with faces
blackened commando-style seized several floors at army
headquarters. Hundreds of rebel soldiers and armed civilians also
took over the Palermo infantry base, Boulogne tank factory and at
least two other installations.
   The rebels insisted their intention was not to overthrow the
government, but to press their demands for changes in the top
military staff.
   But unlike the three insurrections that undermined the
presidency of Raul Alfonsin, Menem refused to negotiate.
   Menem declared a state of siege, later approved by Congress.
``This is an attempted coup d'etat and will be treated as such,''
Menem said.
   One motivation for acting decisively was Bush's scheduled visit.
   A daylong series of firefights in and near this capital of 10
million was capped late in the afternoon by warplanes bombing rebel
tanks on public roads.
   During the revolt, bullets hit Vice President Eduardo Duhalde's
helicopter as it landed at Government House, just two blocks from
army headquarters. Duhalde was unhurt. Government House and the
Economics Ministry were also hit.
   At least seven soldiers, one rebel and five civilians were
killed before order was restored, the government news agency Telam
said. The civilians were in a bus hit by a tank.
   Twenty people were injured in that crash, Telam reported. At
least 11 soldiers and 18 rebels were shot and wounded, army and
hospital officals said, as were at least 10 civilians, news
agencies reported.
   The final shootout took place after dark in Entre Rios Province
to the north of Buenos Aires and across the Parana River. Seventeen
rebels were wounded, Noticias Argentinas reported, and 32 arrested.
About 50 escaped.
   Menem said banks and foreign exchange houses, which closed
during Monday's fighting, would reopen today. Jorge Newbery
metropolitan airport was reopened Monday night. Menem said the
state of siege would be lifted by week's end.
   The insurrection had been carried live on TV and radio, and
public gatherings were banned.
   In April 1987 and January 1988, then Lt. Col. Aldo Rico led
barracks revolts in a bid to halt the trials of officers accused of
human rights abuses during the 1976-83 military dictatorship, force
generals to retire and the government to increase the military
budget.
   Rico was imprisoned and cashiered, but following the revolts,
most trials were halted, military pay was increased and a number of
generals retired.
   The December 1988 insurrection led by Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin
had similar motives and results.
   He was forced to retire. But army chief Gen. Jose Caridi and a
number of other generals retired, soldiers received pay increases
and nearly 300 officers who faced trial eventually were pardoned by
Menem.
   Under Menem, the military budget has shrunk because of
government efforts to control the fiscal deficit, as have the
budgets of most other departments.
   Menem has put the army's biggest base, Campo de Mayo on the
outskirts of Buenos Aires, up for sale along with many defense
industries.
   The privatizations are part of his program to spur an economy in
recession by reducing the role of the state and attracting foreign
capital and technology.

<HEAD>Soviet TV Says Iraq Allowing 1,000 Soviets To Leave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq will allow 1,000 Soviets, about a third of
those still stranded in the country, to leave within the next three
weeks, according to Soviet television.
   Twenty-nine Soviet workers whose Iraqi government contracts
expired flew home Monday on an Aeroflot jetliner, the airline's
Baghdad manager, Alexander Kirichenko, told the ``Vremya'' news
program.
   ``Today we don't have much work to do, only 29 passengers,''
Kirichenko said. ``But the Iraqi authorities have given permission
for 1,000 specialists to leave in the next two or three weeks.''
   About 8,000 Soviets, including military advisers, were living in
Iraq when it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. About 3,000 of them,
including children, left shortly after the invasion and another
1,000 left in September and October.
   Then some began encountering problems securing exit visas.
   The Soviet Union, which has not sent troops to join the U.S.-led
multinational force arrayed against Iraq in Saudi Arabia, was
initially reluctant to accuse the Iraqis of refusing to allow its
citizens to leave.
   But as Soviet leaders adopted a harder line against Iraq over
its refusal to withdraw from Kuwait, backing the U.N. resolution
authorizing the use of force against Iraq that passed on Thursday,
they took Baghdad to task.
   Last week, the Soviets accused Iraq of breaking a promise to
allow 1,000 additional Soviets to leave.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze then warned that the
Soviet Union would use military force if its citizens were harmed.
None are believed to be among the ``human shields'' held by Iraq at
potential military targets.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin said Monday that about
40 Soviet military specialists remain in Iraq, unable to get out of
their contracts to train Iraqi soldiers on using and maintaining
Soviet-supplied weapons.
   He said the remaining Soviets worked for various Iraqi
government agencies, mostly in energy and construction.
   The Soviet Union was Iraq's main military supplier before Iraq
seized Kuwait.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
broadly in thin trading today, while the dollar rose against the
yen for the fourth consecutive trading day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which had
gained 271.36 points on Monday, shed 863.38 points, or 3.80
percent, closing at 21,862.61.
   Volume on the first section was unchanged from Monday's 250
million shares.
   Traders said there were few buyers because the market
anticipated heavy selling by investors who bought stock on credit
and need funds to repay the loans this month.
   They said margin calls in December will total about 1.5 trillion
yen ($11.2 billion), with about 300 billion yen ($2.24 billion)
slated for this week.
   Investors also were discouraged by the declining yen and
prospects of further arbitrage selling, in which investors seek to
profit from price gaps between the spot and futures markets,
traders added.
   The dollar closed at 134.35 yen, up 1.35 yen from Monday's close
of 133.00 yen. It opened at 134.33 yen, and ranged between 133.50
yen and 134.55 yen.
   The dollar now has gained 5.45 yen in the past four trading
days.
   Some $12.73 billion changed hands in spot trading, compared with
$11.44 billion on Monday.
   Atsushi Komatsu, a dealer with Fuji Bank, said the day's
dollar-buying was mainly for technical reasons.
   But he said the U.S. currency was in demand because of
dollar-denominated interest rates staying high in connection with
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The yen also weakened against the German mark because of
relatively higher German interest rates, Komatsu said.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 86.65 from Monday's finish of
86.81. Their yield rose to 7.350 percent from 7.315 percent.

<TEXT>
   ABC's ``Nightline'' today aired Madonna's
too-hot-for-MTV video in its steamy entirety, and Madonna - the
picture of propriety in a buttoned up black dress - defended the
clip as a ``celebration of sex.''
   ``Why are we willing to deal with the reality of violence and
sexism and why aren't we willing to deal with sexuality?'' she
asked in an interview.
   ``If we're going to have censorship, let's not be hypocrites
about this,'' the pop singer added. ``Why is it okay for
10-year-olds to see someone's body being ripped to shreds? ... Why
do parents not have a problems with that?''
   Her ``Justify My Love'' video, which was rejected by the cable
music station last week, features the bra-and-garter-belt-clad
singer in an encounter with a lover, played by her real-life
boyfriend, Tony Ward, in a Paris hotel.
   The video portrays the couple's fantasies, which run to
bisexuality, voyeurism, group sex, cross-dressing and mild
sadomasochism.
   ``Half of me thought I was going to get away with it,'' said
Madonna, speaking via satellite from Los Angeles.
   She said the video - with its chains, black leather and
crucifixes - was about ``honesty ... and the celebration of sex.
There's nothing wrong with that.''
   The video - with some naughty bits electronically altered - had
appeared previously on NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' and on CNN. It
also was shown uncensored on The Jukebox Network, a pay TV channel.
   Before it was shown on ``Nightline,'' ABC lawyers screened the
video, said Laura Wessner, a spokeswoman for the program.
   ``They determined to go ahead with it because of the news value
of the video, the late air time, and the focus of the discussion,''
Wessner said.
   Interviewer Forrest Sawyer asked Madonna to address herself to
feminists who have criticized her boy-toy image.
   ``I may be dressing like the typical bimbo, whatever, but I'm in
charge,'' she answered. ``I'm in charge of my fantasies, I put
myself in these situations with men.''

<TEXT>
   Vietnam's leaders have adopted a plan
to do away with subsidies and central control of the economy and
double the country's per capita income by the year 2000.
   The 10-year plan was adopted at the Communist Party Central
Committee's 10th plenum, which ended last week, the Vietnam News
Agency said in a report seen in Bangkok today.
   The agency said the draft would be presented to the entire
ruling party and later to a party congress scheduled for the
spring.
   The congress also will consider a platform that confirms
socialism as the goal of the nation and the party's leading role in
achieving it, according to an earlier report by the official news
agency.
   A recent official Vietnamese report estimated the country's per
capita annual income in 1989 at about $210, making Vietnam among
the world's poorest countries.
   The objectives of the new plan include ``emancipation from the
state of being a poor and underdeveloped country and creation of
conditions for a faster development in the early 21st century.''
   It said the country, shattered by decades of war with France,
the United States and its neighbors, should at least emerge from
its current economic crisis by 1995.
   Politically, Vietnam has clung to strict party control over the
affairs of its citizens. The country's 1978 invasion of Cambodia
and the collapse of the Soviet bloc have led to growing isolation.
   After its sixth party congress in late 1986, the government
adopted economic reforms that gave companies greater autonomy and
allowed farmers to work land individually instead of on
collectives.
   Those reforms led to ``turning-point'' changes, the report said,
but the new plan will further reduce state control and encourage
small- and medium-sized enterprises, it said.

<TEXT>
   New York City is closing out its bloodiest year
on record: more than 2,000 murders so far, and December -
traditionally one of the deadliest months - has barely begun.
   Police said the increased availability of guns was directly
responsible for the death toll surpassing last year's record of
1,905.
   This year's count of more than 2,000 reflected the first 11
months of the year, according to unofficial statistics released
Monday. Thirteen people were murdered Saturday and Sunday nights,
the first two days of December, police said.
   The murder count included 87 people who died in a fire set at a
social club in March.
   Guns were responsible for 65 percent of the people murdered in
the first eightmonths of the year, police said.
   Deputy Inspector Thomas V. Connolly of the police Office of
Management Analysis and Planning said 9,410 guns were taken off the
streets through the first six months of 1990, compared to more than
16,000 for all of last year.
   Connolly said many murders began as disputes or robberies and
escalated because a weapon was used. An overwhelming majority - 73
percent - of the homicide victims were known to the people who
killed them, he said.

   Scientists dismissed a climatologist's
forecast of a major quake in the Midwest this week but worried that
people won't be ready for the real thing.
   ``We don't want you to stop being prepared for an earthquake''
even if a severe jolt fails to occur, Buddy Schweig, a geologist at
Memphis State University, said Monday at a meeting of the American
Geophysical Union.
   Iben Browning, a New Mexico climatologist, has warned that
strong tidal forces mean there is a 50-50 chance of a quake on the
New Madrid fault of 6.5 to 7.5 on the Richter scale on Sunday or
Monday, give or take two days.
   Many scientists call the forecast nonsense but say it is true
the New Madrid fault is capable of producing devastating quakes, as
it did in 1811 and 1812.
   A repeat today of those quakes could cause 4,500 deaths and $51
billion in damage, according to a mid-1980s study by a Memphis
engineering firm.
   A U.S. Geological Survey advisory group issued a report in
October disputing Browning's projection.
   ``There is no scientific basis to the Browning prediction,''
said Lawrence Braile, a Purdue University seismologist and member
of the panel. ``Browning has put a 50 percent chance on it, which
is a ridiculous number.''
   Browning, who lives in Tijeras, N.M., is on vacation and
unavailable for comment, said his daughter Evelyn Garriss.
   Scientists would be embarrassed if the forecast for a big quake
in the Midwest, San Francisco Bay area or Japan came true this
week, as is possible.
   ``This is not something we'd like to be wrong about,'' admitted
advisory group member Tom Heaton, seismologist in charge of the
Geological Survey office in Pasadena.
   The New Madrid zone stretches from Cairo, Ill., southwest
through New Madrid, Mo., to Marked Tree, Ark.
   In 1811-12, when the region was sparsely populated, the fault
produced three and possibly four great earthquakes estimated at 7.5
to larger than 8 on the Richter scale.
   The quakes killed several dozen people, toppled cabins, snapped
trees, temporarily reversed the flow of the Mississippi River and
reportedly cracked pavement or rang church bells as far away as
Washington, New York and Boston.

   The politicians, the hucksters, the
souvenir hunters, they all rumbled through this town like an
earthquake. About the only thing that didn't make itself felt was
the earthquake itself.
   Climatologist Iben Browning has shaken this sleepy hamlet of
3,300 by saying there was a 50 percent chance of a major quake
along the New Madrid fault this week.
   Some seismologtists used words like ridiculous to describe the
projection. But along the 120-mile fault that runs from Marked
Tree, Ark., to Cairo, Ill., schools closed, some people stayed away
from work and hordes of reporters arrived just in case the quake
really happened.
   ``It didn't happen,'' said Sean-Thomas Morrissey, technical
director of St. Louis University's geophysical observatory. The
university runs a network of 60 seismographs that sense the
slightest tremor in the fault.
   ``There is a small probability of an earthquake on any given
day, but it's the same today as on any other day,'' said Lawrence
Braile, a Purdue University seismologist and member of a U.S.
Geological Survey advisory group. ``Browning has put a 50 percent
chance on it, which is a ridiculous number.''
   Browning was vacationing at an undisclosed location Monday, said
his daughter, Evelynn Garriss.
   Mrs. Garriss noted there was a big quake in the Soviet Union
within the same ``30- to 60-degree north latitudes that we were
concerned about.'' But Mrs. Garriss declined to say whether that
fulfilled her father's projection.
   In any case, she noted that her father said the quake could
happen any time from 48 hours before Monday to 48 hours afterward.
   ``Let's wait until the whole 48 hours are over,'' she said.
   Browning said his projection was based on the fact that the sun
and moon's tidal pull on Earth's oceans reached a 27-year high at 5
a.m. Sunday.
   Although that didn't produce a quake on Monday, New Madrid was
reeling from all the attention it brought.
   ``It's been good for business,'' Councilwoman Barbara Jones said
after a council meeting Monday night.
   Among the entrepreneurs who showed up to capitalize on the
excitement was Lynn Akins of Sikeston, Mo., promoting his outdoor
safety equipment, including a sleeping bag that opens up into a
huge ``Help'' banner. Tom Benz of St. Louis pulled a barbecue
smoker into town to promote his catering business.
   At one point 20 TV news satellite trucks jammed Main Street.
   Jones expressed concern that all the attention could hurt New
Madrid, as word of its active earthquake fault spreads. In the
winter of 1811-1812, when the region was sparsely populated, it
produced three and possibly four great earthquakes estimated at 7.5
to larger than 8 on the Richter scale.
   But City Administrator Don Lloyd said he wasn't worried that
business people considering relocating would think of earthquakes
when they think of New Madrid.
   ``I don't think that will be a factor long term,'' he said.

   Rampaging youths destroyed Daisy Perez's makeshift
Catholic church and shoe store. Then they returned to mock her
grief.
   ``They've destroyed me inside,'' said Perez, sitting on the only
wooden pew left in the church she ran for 23 years. ``This was my
life, this is everything I've got.''
   Perez said Monday she understood why the youths were angered
after six police officers were acquitted earlier in the day of most
federal charges in the beating death of a Puerto Rican drug dealer
from her neighborhood.
   But she couldn't understand who would steal the church pews, and
she asked why the youth would take out their anger on her, stealing
her livelihood.
   ``They took my Bibles, they took all of my shoes,'' she said.
``This is such hate.''
   As Mayor Xavier Suarez promised Perez the church would be
repaired in time for Mass on Wednesday, the same kids who had
ruined the store returned and stood behind Suarez.
   ``Oh, poor me! Oh, poor me!'' they sobbed and laughed
sarcastically.
   The mayor met privately with some community leaders and vowed to
give more recognition to the Puerto Rican neighborhood he admitted
has been neglected.
   The violence began after the officers were acquitted of beating
to death Leonardo Mercado two years ago. They faced a maximum of
life in prison.
   ``It was supposed to be the chair - the (electric) chair man!''
shouted one looter, who carried a TV set out of a store and smashed
it.
   Two teen-age girls giggled as they ran from the store, holding
hands and carrying bottles of scotch. Other youths smashed in the
doors and windows and carted off merchandise.
   Furniture was hauled out, put in a pile and set on fire. A
burning chair thrown through the front door sent the store up in
flames.
   Small crowds attacked TV trucks and photographers, smashing van
windows and grabbing cameras. Residents hustled some reporters into
their homes for protection.
   When police arrived several hours into the melee, residents
hissed and shouted, hardly intimidated by the officers' riot gear.
   One cop kneeled and pointed his shotgun toward a group of
teen-age boys. Another cop shouted at him, ``Don't ... shoot 'em
alive!''
   ``I'm so depressed to see all this,'' said Dwayne Green, a
21-year-old black resident. ``I can see why they're doing this. But
they're going to suffer anyway. It's just like the blacks, they
suffer anyway.''

   A month after U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms
defeated a black man for re-election in a racially divisive
campaign, Dan Blue was virtually assured of becoming North
Carolina's first black speaker of the state House.
   The Democrat's chances of winning the leadership position on
Friday rose on Monday after his chief rival, Bob Hunter, withdrew
from the race, citing the cause of party unity and saying he didn't
think he had the votes to win.
   Another candidate, John J. Hunt, announced that he, too, was
pulling out of the race. Since Democrats outnumber Republicans
81-39 in the House, Blue would be assured of being chosen speaker
s long as the Democrats maintained unity.
   There are 14 blacks in the state House.
   Blue, a Raleigh lawyer, was first elected to the Legislature in
1981, has served as chairman of the legislative black caucus and
sponsored the law declaring Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday an
official state holiday.
   He was active in the Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis campaigns
in 1988.
   He also was instrumental in changing the state's election laws
last year to lower from 50 percent to 40 percent the share of votes
needed to win a primary.
   Blacks, in particular, had complained that the 50 percent
requirement discriminated against black candidates.
   Last month, Helms beat former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt in a
bitter and racially divisive contest.

<HEAD>Runoff Election in Liberal Berkeley Test of Political Direction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Today's mayoral runoff in Berkeley offered
voters a chance to recalibrate the city's political compass, which
has always pointed left.
   One-term Mayor Loni Hancock wants to continue that liberal
agenda that since the 1960s has put Berkeley at the forefront of
issues such as human rights, the environment, affirmative action
and help for the poor.
   Challenger Fred Weekes, a one-term city councilman, said local
government should concentrate on more mundane problems such as
potholes and redevelopment.
   ``And I think we need to get rid of the ideological practices in
City Hall,'' he said.
   The home of the University of California at Berkeley was a
hotbed of leftist politics and student unrest during the Vietnam
War. The university was the birthplace of the college Free Speech
movement in 1964.
   Hancock, who was on the council for eight years during the
1970s, said Berkeley can remain dedicated to social change while
caring for the infrastructure and other needs in the city of about
109,000 people.
   ``Berkeley is really at a crossroads,'' she said Monday. ``We
pioneered environmental protection. We pioneered many social
programs to make people's lives better.''
   ``But we also have laid the groundwork for programs in the city,
from affordable housing to recycling and downtown revitalization,''
the 50-year-old mayor continued. ``The important thing is to see
them through to completion.''
   The runoff was necessary because Hancock failed to get more than
50 percent of the Nov. 6 vote. She fell 38 votes short out of
44,339 cast.
   Weekes, 65, spent about $200,000 and Hancock has spent about
half that in her bid to retain the part-time job that pays $21,000
a year.
   Most of Weekes' support has come from ``the hills'' - the more
affluent part of Berkeley - and from developers who don't like
rules that require them to pay for programs such as traffic,
affordable housing and child care.
   Hancock's strongholds are the liberal - some say leftist -
Berkeley Citizens Action party that she is affiliated with,
university students and residents of ``the flats.''

<HEAD>ANC Warns New Factional Fighting Threatens Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The African National Congress
warned today that the factional fighting that has claimed at least
78 lives in recent days threatens to derail peace talks with the
white-led government.
   An ANC statement charged security forces were responsible for
the violence that erupted in black townships around Johannesburg
over the weekend. It said the disorder was intended to discredit
the ANC in talks on ending apartheid.
   ``Unrest areas have now been declared to Tokoza, Katlehong,
Vosloorus and Bekkersdal, granting the very police responsible for
the carnage even greater powers over the lives of our people,'' the
statement said.
   ``The violence placed the peace process in jeopardy,'' it said.
   ``There's no way we can talk peace if people continue to be
killed,'' Communist Party leader Joe Slovo said Monday. The
Communist Party is allied with the ANC.
   Some residents of the townships have claimed that Zulu warriors
were being aided by armed whites, but provided no evidence of this.
   The fighting pitted Zulus loyal to the Inkatha Freedom Party
against Xhosas and other blacks who support the ANC, the country's
main opposition group. The ANC has long accused the government of
siding with Inkatha.
   President F.W. de Klerk has promised to scrap apartheid and
share power with the black majority. Talks between the government,
the ANC and other black groups on writing a new constitution are
expected to begin next year.
   No violence was reported today in Tokoza and other townships,
police said. Hundreds of terrified residents have fled their homes,
and mMore than a half million people live in the townships
currently under curfew.
   South African news reports said the fighting was set off
Saturday when Zulu gangs searched houses in Tokoza for Xhosas and
killed several people.
   Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi said his forces were
not to blame.
   ``I object therefore to blame being automatically apportioned to
so-called `impis' (regiments) of the Inkatha Freedom Party,'' he
said in a statement.
   Zulu leaders claimed several of their followers had been shot by
police for no apparent reason.
   About 1,000 blacks have been killed in factional fighting in
Johannesburg townships since August. The fighting subsided after
September, but flared anew in recent weeks.
   The ANC and Inkatha both oppose apartheid, but are divided by
rival leadership and differing visions of a future South Africa.
Inkatha favors free-market system, while the ANC leans more to
socialist economic programs.

   The city's schools chief is proposing that
condoms be given out on request to New York's 261,000 high school
students.
   Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez is expected to present the
AIDS-prevention plan on Wednesday to the Board of Education for
approval.
   If approved, the plan would be perhaps the most far-reaching in
the nation.
   Under the proposal, students would be able to get condoms from
volunteers at school without having to get parental consent or
birth-control counseling.
   ``People at any age have ready access to condoms at supermarkets
and drugstores without the benefit of an educational or counseling
component,'' Fernandez explained.
   He said in a memo to the board that he was taking action because
New York leads the nation in adolescent AIDS cases.
   The board is expected to vote in January. Of the seven members,
two have indicated opposition; a third has expressed some
reservations.

   Rain swept the East early today, while snow from a major winter
storm tapered off in the upper Midwest and headed for New England.
   A flood watch was in effect today in the Mohawk Valley, the
Catskills, the Susquehanna River region and western Adirondacks in
New York state.
   Snow fell along the mid-Mississippi River valley and the
southern Great Lakes region. The system that delivered the first
winter storm of the season was expected to bring snow to New
Hampshire, Maine, Vermont and New York.
   Rain fell from Pennsylvania through New England, and from Maine
to southern Florida along much of the Eastern Seaboard. Rain also
fell in Washington state.
   Winter storm watches were posted for Indiana and Washington
state, and a high wind warning was posted for Montana.
   The National Weather Service said high pressure will dominate
the weather pattern over the nation's mid-section through
Wednesday.
   The nation's high on Monday was 88 degrees at El Cajon, Calif.

<TEXT>
   Police set up checkpoints along Israel's 1967
borders and frisked Palestinians driving from the occupied lands
into Israel today, in the first sign of sweeping new security
measures.
   News reports said Defense Minister Moshe Arens also plans to
increase deportations of Palestinians and block thousands of Arabs
from entering Israel.
   The measures are a reaction to the stabbing attacks that have
claimed five Israeli lives in the last two months. Seven
Palestinians involved in the attacks were killed by police or
Israeli revenge seekers.
   On Sunday, three West Bank Palestinians boarded a bus in Tel
Aviv, stabbed to death one passenger and wounded three. Police shot
to death one assailant and captured the other two.
   Israel radio reported massive traffic jams on the roads leading
to Tel Aviv as the checkpoints went up along the so-called Green
Line, the boundary with the West Bank and Gaza Strip before Israel
captured them in the 1967 war.
   ``We're doing body checks to see if they have knives. We also
check their bags and their cars,'' police spokesman Adi Gonen said.
``It's not a pleasure for them, but we have no choice.''
   Police are now obliged to carry a pistol or Uzi submachine gun
at all times, Gonen said. Police also recommended that bus drivers
be allowed to carry guns on the job, he said.
   The Maariv newspaper ran a front-page picture of a driver
working the route on which Sunday's attack occurred. Driver Salman
Bassu held up a pistol, brass knuckles and a knife. He said he
would carry the weapons on the job every day.
   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported Arens wanted to increase to
15,000 the number of restrictive identity cards for Palestinians.
About 10,800 such cards have been issued so far. The cards prohibit
their holders from visiting Israel.
   The stabbings are meant as revenge for the Oct. 8 police
shootings on Jerusalem's Temple Mount that killed at least 17
Arabs.
   About 110,000 Palestinians work in Israel, most as day laborers.
Labor Minister David Magen has suggested reducing their number by
50,000 to make room for Soviet Jewish immigrants.
   Israel radio said Arens is planning to step up deportations of
Palestinians. Israel has deported 60 Palestinians since the start
of the uprising in the occupied lands nearly three years ago.
   The expulsions have been criticized by the United States, Europe
and human rights groups as a violation of the Fourth Geneva
Convention.
   The convention, which Israel signed, bars deportations of
civilians from occupied areas. Israel argues that the Geneva
Convention only bans mass deportation, not expulsions of a few
individuals.

<TEXT>
   A space capsule carrying a Japanese journalist and
two Soviet cosmonauts docked today with the orbiting Mir space
station, Tass reported.
   The Soyuz TM-11 capsule, launched Sunday from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia, will return to Earth on Monday
with journalist Toyohiro Akiyama and a Soviet crew completing a
five-month expedition.
   Akiyama is the first Japanese in space, and also the first
journalist.
   Tass said the docking at 12:57 p.m. (4:47 a.m. EST) was
uneventful.
   Cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev and flight engineer Musa Manarov
will remain on board the space station until May 1991. They plan
four space walks.
   Akiyama, a 48-year-old news director for Japan's TBS television
company, will photograph environmental damage on Earth and conduct
experiments on Japanese tree frogs to see how they cope in a
gravity-free environment.
   He has also been broadcasting television and radio reports.
   TBS, Japan's biggest private television company, paid $12
million for a seat on the space capsule and exclusive rights to
Akiyama's reports.
   It is part of a Soviet campaign to make its space program more
profitable.
   Soviet officials and TBS executives also expressed hopes that
the flight could improve ties between the two countries, which
never officially ended their World War II hostilities.

   Six Americans who had been detained in Iraq
arrived back in the United States early today with former boxing
champion Muhammad Ali, who had secured their release.
   The former hostages said their treatment in Iraq had been
adequate, but they were sorry to leave hundreds of other hostages
behind.
   Ali did not speak to reporters after the group arrived at
Kennedy International Airport. An attorney, Paul Sanchi, read a
statement from Ali that said, ``I'm on the side of Al Islam, which
means peace.''
   The six were among the 15 Americans released last week after Ali
met with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Freed hostage Harry Brill-Edwards, 49, of Fort Lee, N.J.,
described Ali as ``a super gentleman'' and said this was ``the real
human side of a super sportsman.''
   Brill-Edwards, chairman of Chromoloy Corp. in Orangeburg, N.Y.,
had gone to Kuwait for one day of business and was taken hostage
Aug. 3, the day after Iraq invaded Kuwait. He and other hostages
said they had been moved frequently within Iraq.
   He said of his treatment, ``a lot depended on the political
situation. As things got tougher, it got tougher for us.''
   Brill-Edwards added that while he was happy to be home, ``I
can't smile from the inside, knowing that there are 1,500 still
left there.''
   Richard Iliff of Atlanta, a General Motors executive, said the
hostages' treatment depended on individual guards.
   He said he was fed adequately but added, ``I don't think I'll
eat tomatoes or cucumbers again for life.''
   Royce ``Red'' Smat of Houston said he had been held north of
Baghdad.
   He described his treatment as ``OK,'' but added that ``my heart
hurts'' for those still held.
   The other hostages were Sergio Coletta of Moss Point., Miss.;
George Chanchalis of Reno, Nev.; and Ralph Leidholdt of Lakewood,
Colo.

<HEAD>Iraq Claims Embargo-Caused Shortages Killing Children</HEAD>

   Iraq claims more than 1,400 children under
5 years old have died due to shortages caused by the U.N. embargo,
but doctors and Western diplomats say there are no serious
shortages of food or basic medicines.
   Iraq said today it was reducing the December rations of sugar
and tea for adults by one-fourth. But it said the allotment for all
other foods covered by rationing would remain the same.
   The report of child deaths stemming from the economic sanctions
came from Iraqi Health Minister Abdul-Salam Mohammed Saeed.
   He told the official Iraqi News Agency on Monday that 1,416
children had died and that many of them had not received needed
medicine or sufficient milk because of shortages created by the
embargo.
   There is no way to independently verify Iraqi figures on child
deaths or to confirm how many if any of the children died for those
reasons.
   The government is the sole importer of medicine in Iraq and the
only official source of information on supply. However, a doctor at
one Baghdad hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
recently there was no shortage of basic medicines or medical
supplies in Iraq.
   Iraqis say they can buy medicines and powdered milk for their
children, but mostly only at exorbitant black market rates.
   Western diplomats in Baghdad, who generally discount reports of
acute food and medicine shortages, said Iraq received more than 30
tons of medical supplies between mid-October and mid-November alone
in exchange for the release of Western hostages.
   Another 40 tons of medical supplies reportedly were shipped to
Iraq in late November, diplomats said. Italy alone sent 25 tons of
medicine, mainly measles, polio and diphtheria vaccines, on Nov.
24. All of it was earmarked for Iraqi children.
   Some diplomats and medical personnel in Baghdad suggested last
month that Iraq might be stockpiling medicine in case of war and
that some of the reported shortages resulted from profiteering.
   Government-run hospitals report shortages of antibiotics,
medicines, vaccines and baby formula and tell patients they must
bring their own.
   Iraqis say prices at pharmacies and on the black market are
often at least five times higher than normal. They say many
pharmacies, enticed by higher profits, have diverted stocks to the
black market.
   The government rationing plan instituted in September limits
each child under a year old to three 16-ounce cans of baby formula
a month. At government-subsidized stores, each can costs $2.25 at
the official rate.
   Iraqis forced to supplement their children's diet with powdered
milk bought on the black market pay as much as 40 dinars for a
2.2-pound can. That price, beyond the means of many Iraqis, amounts
to $120 at the official rate and between $8 and $13 at varying
black-market rates.
   Iraq has often claimed the sanctions are inhumane and deny food,
milk and medicine to children. But the diplomats note that the
sanctions do not prohibit imports of food and medicine for
humanitarian reasons.
   Food shelves at private stores and vegetable markets in the
capital are well stocked, often with goods looted from Kuwait or
smuggled in from Iran or Jordan.
   Prices of many goods have soared to three and four times their
normal cost. But with the arrival of looted supplies from Kuwait,
the price of some goods, such as cooking oil and rice, has actually
dropped.

   Iraq sent Britain a $289,000 hotel bill for 27
Britons who worked on the presidential palace and threatened to
move them to strategic sites unless it was paid, the Foreign Office
said today.
   The British Embassy in Baghdad will pick up the tab, a Foreign
Office spokesman said, and will try to recover the money from Iraq
when the Persian Gulf crisis ends.
   The spokesman, who requested anonymity, said 19 of the
construction workers remained at the Babylon and Novotel Hotels,
two five-star hotels in Baghdad. The other eight workers have been
allowed to return to Britain.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said Iraq threatened to move the men
to strategic sites unless the hotel bill was paid.
   The men's employer, Interiors International, had not paid the
bill, the Foreign Office spokesman said, adding he did not know
why.
   The men had been working on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
presidential palace in Baghdad, the spokesman said.
   Meanwhile, eight British women flew to Jordan today en route to
Iraq, where they hope to meet with Saddam and plead for the release
of their relatives.
   Iraq has prevented many foreigners from leaving since its army
occupied Kuwait on Aug. 2. Some foreigners are detained at
strategic sites as part of a ``human shield'' against a possible
attack by the U.S.-led multinational force.

<TEXT>
   The commander of Turkey's land forces was
appointed chief of the general staff today to replace a general who
resigned because he differed with President Turgut Ozal over
Persian Gulf policy.
   Prime Minister Yildirim Akbulut announced the appointment of
Gen. Dogan Gures to succeed Gen. Necip Torumtay, who resigned
Monday.
   The appointment was in accordance with military tradition, as
Gures was the second highest ranking army general after Torumtay.
However, it may not solve Ozal's problems. Sources said Gures
shares Torumtay's view that Turkey should refrain from an active
role in any possible war to force Iraq out of Kuwait.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Gures is
also uncompromising in his opposition to Islamic fundamentalism in
this predominantly Moslem but secular country.
   Analysts say Torumtay's resignation was an indication of the
army's dissatisfaction with what is viewed as the Ozal government's
encouragement of Islamic fundamentalist groups.
   In his letter of resignation, Torumtay said only that he found
it impossible to continue in his post in the light of ``principles
I believe in and my understanding of statecraft.''
   Commentaries in Turkish papers today lauded Torumtay's decision
as ``honorable and democratic.''
   Torumtay was the third senior official to resign in three
months. Defense Minister Safa Giray resigned in November and
Foreign Minister Ali Bozer in October, the latter reportedly
because he differed with Ozal over gulf policy.
   Foreign Ministry and defense officials are said to feel that
Ozal is dragging Turkey into war with Iraq in his enthusiasm to
join the Western coalition grouped against Saddam Hussein.
   Torumtay, a 64-year-old former military attache in Tokyo and
Washington, had been chief of staff for three years.
   In a farewell message to Turkey's 800,000-strong armed forces,
the second-largest army in NATO after the United States, Torumtay
said ``the road shown by Ataturk'' was ``the goal which cannot be
deviated from.''
   Kemal Ataturk set up modern Turkey in 1923 and instituted
westernizing reforms, firmly rooting the country in secularism.
   Fundamentalists, estimated to make up 12 percent of Turkey's
population of 57 million, have grown increasingly militant. Many
Turks hold them responsible for the killing this year of three
prominentadvocates of secularism.
   Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, Ozal has placed
Turkey firmly at the side of the United States. He cut off
pipelines carrying Iraqi crude through this country and banned all
trade with Iraq.
   Turkish officials have ruled out the possibility of Turkey
opening a ``second front'' from the north if the United States and
its allies go to war against Iraq.
   Urged on by Ozal, however, parliament has authorized the
government to send Turkish troops abroad and to allow foreign
troops in this country if necessary.
   U.S. Air Force F-16 and F-111 aircraft have been deployed at the
Incirlik base in southern Turkey since August.
   The prominent daily Cumhuriyet reported Sunday that a top-level
strategy meeting on the crisis was held Saturday at the Cankaya
Palace. Military officials present argued that Turkey was doing
enough by tying up eight Iraqi divisions along its border and
should stay out of war, the newspaper said.
   Ozal, who took office last year after serving as prime minister
since 1983, has been ignoring sections of the 1982 constitution,
written under military rule, that theoretically limit his power.
   Officials say he runs the country, especially its foreign
affairs, through Akbulut, the prime minister and his hand-picked
successor.
   Three times since 1960, the military has toppled Turkey's
civilian government. The latest takeover was in 1980, following a
period of political violence which claimed 5,000 lives.

<HEAD>Speculation Rages Over Gorbachev's Aims in Interior Ministry
Shake-Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper speculated today that President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev may name Vadim Bakatin to the new post of vice
president after having removed him as Interior Minister over the
weekend.
   Neither Gorbachev nor Bakatin immediately commented on the
report in Komsomolskaya Pravda, which added to a swirl of
speculation in the Supreme Soviet legislature on the intentions
behind Gorbachev's latest shake-up.
   Traditionalist, hard-line legislators praised Gorbachev's
decision to dismiss Bakatin as Interior Minister and replace him
with a KGB general who is expected to crack down on independence
movements and black marketeering.
   But the newspaper report raised the possibility that Gorbachev
could be feinting left and striking right: removing a favorite of
reformists, only to place him in a more important post.
   The Interior Ministry commands the Soviet militia, or police,
which includes special riot squads and paramilitary troops.
   Bakatin is popular among reformers who support the independence
movements in the Baltics and other restive republics, because he
put a tight rein on the riot police after 19 peaceful demonstrators
were killed by troops wielding shovels and gas in Tbilisi, Georgia,
last year.
   Traditionalist Communists have criticized the Interior Ministry,
and Gorbachev, for not declaring emergencies and cracking down on
independence activists in Moldavia, Georgia and other hotspots.
   Asked whether Bakatin would be named vice president,
presidential spokesman Vitaly Ignatenko told a news conference
today: ``I cannot tell you. The issue has not been considered
yet.''
   Ignatenko added that Gorbachev did not remove Bakatin because of
any dissatisfaction with his performance.
   ``I believe that a new post is in line for him, but we will have
to be patient to see what that post will be,'' he said.
   Mikhail Bronshtein, a lawmaker from the Baltic republic of
Estonia, said Bakatin was unpopular among hard-liners there because
he had agreed to transfer law enforcement authority from central to
local officials.
   Bakatin, who was removed as interior minister on Sunday, was
replaced by Boris Pugo, 53, a Communist Party official who became a
KGB major general while running the secret police in Latvia in the
early 1980s.
   Col. Victor Alksnis, a lawmaker who has threatened to seek
Gorbachev's resignation unless he takes action by Dec. 17 to
prevent the breakup of the nation, told reporters Monday that the
replacement of Bakatin was a good step.
   Gorbachev's removal of Bakatin ``is obviously a response to the
ultimatum by Alksnis,'' who heads the Soyuz, or Union, group of
hard-line lawmakers, said Dmitri Simes, a Soviet expert at the
Carnegie Endowment for Peace in Washington. But Simes added that it
was difficult to know whether Gorbachev was truly sympathic to
their demands or merely making a politically expedient concession
to them.
   Pugo is a friend of Alksnis, Simes said. Both men are Latvians
who are extremely unpopular in their native land for their
opposition to independence from the Soviet Union, he said.
   Bakatin previously has been mentioned as a possible candidate
for prime minister. He was nominated for president last spring, and
declined to run against Gorbachev.
   Sunday's announcement said Bakatin was being released ``in
connection with his transition to another job.'' Interior Ministry
spokesman Boris P. Mikhailov said today that Gorbachev has
temporarily assigned Bakatin to study ``changes in the structure of
the Presidential Council,'' on which he sits.
   In a Nov. 17 speech to the Supreme Soviet, Gorbachev indicated
he would eliminate both the 16-member Presidential Council and the
Council of Ministers in favor of several new bodies, including a
National Security Council. But he has not provided details on how
the new bodies would work.

<TEXT>
   Border guards shot and killed 22
suspected Moslem militants today after they illegally crossed into
India from Pakistan, authorities said.
   A group of 25 militants crossed the border in the mountainous
Kupwara region at dawn, said a police spokesman speaking on
condition of anonymity, and opened fire when challenged by guards
about a half-mile from the frontier.
   After a gun battle, the guards found the bodies of 22 people, he
said. Searches were continuing for the other three, he said.
   There was no mention of casualties among the guards.
   Kupwara is 50 miles northwest of Srinagar, the largest city in
the Kashmir valley. The frontier at Kupwara zigzags across
snowbound moutains and steep valleys and borders are guarded by
occasional patrols.
   New Delhi has often accused Pakistan of training Moslem
militants agitating for the secession of the Kashmir valley from
India, where Hindus predominate.
   Pakistan, an Islamic nation, denies the charges but says the
Kashmiri people have the right to self-determination.
   The Kashmir valley forms part of the Indian state of Jammu and
Kashmir. At least 65 percent of the state's 6 million people are
Moslems and most of them live in the valley.
   At least 1,600 people have been killed in Kashmir since early
this year.

   Israeli troops today killed an armed guerrilla
in a firefight in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in
southern Lebanon, the military command said.
   Two Israeli soldiers were slightly wounded in the clash, which
occurred in the western sector near the village of Ramayah, 2{
miles north of the Israeli settlement of Zarit, the army said.
   ``Israeli forces from the Givati infantry brigade were on an
initiated action when they spotted a squad of guerrillas heading
toward the Israeli border and they opened fire from a short
distance,'' an army statement said.
   Troops found a LAW antitank bazooka, grenade launchers, and
magazines from a Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifle near the body of
the slain guerrilla, the army said.
   It was not immediately known to which organization the
guerrillas belonged.
   In Lebanon, the Moslem-run Voice of the Nation said the Israelis
brought tanks to reinforce their troops and helicopter gunships
strafed suspected guerrilla positions in the region after daybreak.
   Today's clash followed a spate of incidents involving Israeli
soldiers or their militia allies in or around the
Israeli-controlled zone in south Lebanon.
   On Monday, Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen killed five
guerrillas who, according to an army statement, belonged to a
Lebanese branch of the Baath party and the Lebanese Resistance
Front.
   Last week, five Israeli soldiers from the Givati brigade and two
Palestinian guerrillas were killed in a clash on the eastern sector
of the buffer zone. The army said those guerrillas belonged to the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a PLO faction led by
George Habash.
   Israel carved out the 440-square-mile buffer zone to protect its
northern border against guerrilla raids in 1985, when it withdrew
the bulk of its forces from Lebanon after a three-year occupation.
   The zone is jointly patrolled by Israeli soldiers and some 2,700
members of the mostly Christian South Lebanon Army militia.

   Northwest Airlines has made headlines in
recent years for a major jetliner crash, a change in ownership, the
convictions of three of its pilots who were flying while
intoxicated, and its efforts to eliminate smoking on planes.
   Here are details of those and other events:
   -Aug. 16, 1987: Northwest Flight 255 crashed near Detroit
Metropolitan Airport, killing 156 people when the MD-80 failed to
gain altitude during takeoff and slammed into a highway overpass.
The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that the pilots
didn't set the plane's wing flaps and slats properly for takeoff
and that failure of a cockpit warning device contributed to the
crash.
   -March 23, 1988: Northwest announced that it would ban smoking
on all of its continental domestic flights effective April 23, the
same day a federal law would take effect banning smoking on all
flights of two hours or less. Northwest's policy went beyond the
new law's requirements.
   -Aug. 3, 1989: Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi signed
acquisition papers to complete his group's $3.65 billion buyout of
NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines.
   -Dec. 28, 1989: Northwest publicized a bomb threat it received
for a Dec. 30 flight from Paris to Detroit. More than 100 people
canceled their reservations for the flight; 28 passengers and 14
crew members made the trip.
   -Jan. 4, 1990: An engine fell off a three-engine Northwest plane
flying from Miami to Minneapolis; the Boeing 727 landed safely in
Tampa, Fla. Federal officials said improper maintenance was
involved and proposed a $200,000 fine.
   -March 8, 1990: Three Northwest pilots flying a Boeing 727 from
Fargo, N.D., were arrested at Minneapolis-St. Paul International
Airport after authorities were alerted that the pilots had been
drinking heavily the night before. The three became the first
commercial pilots to be convicted for flying a jetliner while
intoxicated. Their sentences ranged from one year to 16 months.
   -May 28, 1990: A Northwest pilot on his way to work was charged
with driving under the influence of alcohol. He later pleaded
guilty to a lesser charge and was fined $627. The pilot is
appealing Northwest's decision to fire him for violating company
rules against drinking within 12 hours of a scheduled flight.
   -Sept. 11, 1990: A Northwest captain's pilot's license was
suspended after a hearing in which authorities said he buzzed a
snowmobile race in one private plane and crash-landed another
because of a fuel problem.
   -Sept. 20, 1990: Airbus Industrie said Northwest got a $500
million loan from Airbus and General Electric Co. The loan
coincided with an order for 75 Airbus planes valued at $4.6
billion. Later, a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills said Hills believed the loan could be an unfair inducement to
get Northwest to buy the jets. Representatives of Airbus, a
four-nation consortium, denied any unfairness.
   -Oct. 16, 1990: Checchi said layoffs and a reduced flight
schedule were imminent since machinists rejected a temporary wage
cut. Northwest announced it was implementing a third major fare
increase in as many months due to higher jet fuel prices brought on
by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   -Oct. 17, 1990: Northwest said ground workers in Atlanta filled
the hydraulic systems of two DC-9 jets with a mixture of hand soap
and hydraulic fluid. The airline called it a mistake, not sabotage.
Fifty flights were canceled around the country and 12 DC-9s were
grounded for inspections.
   -Nov. 12, 1990: Northwest said higher fuels costs associated
with the Mideast crisis caused a 47 percent drop in its
third-quarter earnings and will result in a fourth-quarter loss.
   -Nov. 16, 1990: The Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported that
Checchi was exploring a buyout of Eastern Airlines using up to $150
million in pension funds of Eastern's union pilots.
   -Nov. 17, 1990: The Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported that
the Federal Aviation Administration had ordered Northwest to
examine 11 planes for possible safety defects. The FAA warned that
an instrument critical to controlling the plane has jammed at least
six times on A320s operated by foreign carriers and in test
flights, the Star Tribune reported.
   -Dec. 3, 1990: Two Northwest jetliners collide on the ground at
Detroit Metropolitan Airport, killing eight people.

   Iraq said today it will let nearly 3,300
Soviet experts leave the country, but demanded that the Kremlin pay
to terminate their work contracts.
   The official radio and the Iraqi News Agency said the ruling
Revolutionary Command Council, headed by President Saddam Hussein,
decided to allow the Soviets to depart.
   In Moscow, presidential spokesman Vitaly Ignatenko said the
Kremlin has not been officially notified of the Iraqi decision.
``We have not yet had signals that would inspire such a hope,''
said Ignatenko.
   He said there are 3,232 Soviets in Iraq, mostly construction
workers, oil and gas experts and pipeline layers. Thousands of
Soviets left Iraq after Saddam's troops overran Kuwait.
   Iraqi radio and INA quoted the Revolutionary Command Council as
saying that the remaining Soviets can go as of Wednesday.
   The council said it acted ``so that this issue of Soviet experts
remains outside the framework of the various deals under way which
regrettably involve the Soviet Union.
   ``We have decided to allow all Soviet experts wishing to travel
out of Iraq to do so, provided that the Soviet government alone
assumes full responsibility for the consequences of breaking
contracts in this regard,'' the council statement said.
   Iraq had warned foreign companies it would demand compensation
for any contract breached after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
After the invasion, the United Nations imposed an international
trade embargo on Iraq.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin indicated the
Kremlin had no problem over compensation.
   ``If the matter has been resolved now, then obviously the
contract issue has also been resolved,'' he said in Moscow.
   A Soviet Oil Ministry official, Sarkis Arkilian, has been in
Baghdad for more than a week trying to win exit visas for the
Soviets.
   The Soviet Union has backed all 12 U.N. Security Council
resolutions against Iraq, including one Thursday authorizing the
use of force to drive Iraq from Kuwait unless its army withdraws by
Jan. 15.
   After last week's vote, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze said Moscow would not hesitate to use force against
Iraq to protect its citizens.
   In Moscow, Soviet television reported earlier that Iraq has
given 1,000 Soviets permission to leave. Twenty-nine Soviet workers
whose Iraqi government contracts expired flew home Monday, Soviet
TV quoted Alexander Kirichenko, Baghdad manager for the Soviet
airline Aeroflot as saying.
   Iraq banned many foreigners from traveling in response to the
U.S.-led military buildup that followed the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait. Saddam's government has relocated hundreds of foreigners to
strategic sites to serve as ``human shields'' against possible
attack.
   Soviet citizens were excused from the travel ban, and no Soviets
were detained at strategic sites.
   Moscow was Iraq's main arms supplier during the 1980-88 war
against Iran, and there were about 200 military advisers in Iraq at
the time of the invasion.

   Police said today they made
arrests in connection with the shooting death of 30-year-old
Protestant man whose slaying may have been a case of mistaken
identity.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary refused to say how many men were
being questioned about Monday night's shooting of David Andrew
Shiels, a baker's assistant.
   Shiels was shot as he left his mobile home to feed his dog,
police said. The constabulary said the gunmen may have mistaken
Shiels for his brother, who works as a police officer.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the shooting.
   The dead man's wife was slightly hurt by debris which flew into
the mobile home during the attack Monday night in County
Londonderry, 30 miles northwest of Belfast, police said.
   The couple's 4-month-old baby was not injured, the constabulary
said.
   In other developments today, the constabulary said four
checkpoints along the border with the Irish Republic would be
closed at night to prevent IRA ``human bomb'' attacks.
   The Irish Republican Army has launched four such attacks using
civilians who are kidnapped and forced to drive vehicles loaded
with explosives to the heavily guarded border crossings.
   Six soldiers and one civilian have been killed in the attacks.
   The predominantly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting British rule in
Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant
north with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.

   Hundreds of youths looted stores and burned cars
after six police officers were acquitted in the fatal beating of a
Puerto Rican drug dealer. The uprising, Miami's fifth riot in a
decade, caught police off guard.
   The five-hour melee in a Puerto Rican section ended Monday night
when about 200 officers in riot gear moved into the dead man's
neighborhood and made about 10 arrests.
   The only injuries reported were to two news photographers, who
said they were roughed up and their cameras stolen.
   Except for curious onlookers, watchful police, reporters,
photographers and television news crews, the area was quiet this
morning.
   Among the onlookers was businessman Patrick Gerritts, who
somberly surveyed the collapsed, smoldering ruins of his general
contracting firm.
   ``They've ruined us,'' he said of the people who first looted,
then torched his office-warehouse. ``They've ruined my life. I'm 53
years old,'' Gerritts said. ``I've been coming here for 35 years,
every day of my life.''
   The violence began after the officers were acquitted of beating
to death Leonardo Mercado two years ago by stomping on him,
pummeling him, and smashing him in the ead with a flashlight or
nightstick.
   Several dozen youths, their faces concealed by paper bags and
shirts, gathered at a park and began pelting police and passing
vehicles with rocks and bottles.
   As the melee built, several stores were torched and their
merchandise and furniture set ablaze in the street. About 10 cars
were set on fire, overturned or had their windows smashed.
   ``We want justice,'' said 17-year-old Yvette Diaz. ``The other
people, the black people ... this is how they did it, and it
worked.''
   Police killings have prompted violence in Miami four other times
in the past decade, most recently in 1989 when a Hispanic police
officer's shooting of a black motorcyclist set off three days of
rioting by blacks.
   Police relations worsened this year when officers violently
broke up a demonstration by Haitians outside a Cuban-owned clothing
store.
   But city officials were stunned by the intensity of anger in the
Puerto Rican neighborhood.
   ``We really didn't expect this riot. We did expect some protests
- a group of Mercado's friends, family - but we didn't expect
something like this,'' said police spokesman Armando Villorin.
   No immediate estimate of damage was available.
   ``This is such hate,'' said Daisy Perez, whose storefront
Catholic church and shoe shop had been emptied of shoes, Bibles and
wooden pews.
   Earlier Monday, a federal jury found six members of the police
drug squad innocent of 17 of 24 counts and reported itself
deadlocked on six civil rights murder counts in the 1988 slaying of
Mercado, a 35-year-old small-time drug dealer.
   The government has not indicated whether it will retry the
officers.
   The officers' lawyers had argued they were just doing their jobs
and protecting themselves from Mercado, who allegedly went into a
frenzy and was thrashing about when police arrested him.
   ``This is just what I've been predicting in this case since day
one - that the people would back us,'' Officer Pablo Camacho, the
42-year-old alleged leader of the attack on Mercado, said after the
verdict.
   Mercado's family, which has filed a $10 million lawsuit against
the officers, was angered by the acquittal. ``If they were (found)
guilty, none of this would've happened,'' said Menerva Ramos, a
niece of Mercado's.
   ``I expected justice to be done here this afternoon, and I see
there wasn't no justice,'' said Pedro Soto, one of Mercado's
stepsons.
   Mayor Xavier Suarez blamed poverty for the uprising and promised
to bring more city money to one of its poorest neighborhoods.
   ``These things have a tendency to repeat themselves and I guess
Miami's now gotten in this rut,'' said former Mayor Maurice Ferre.

   A Sudanese relief plane crashed and burned
early today while trying to land at Nairobi's international airport
in heavy fog, killing all 10 people aboard, airport authorities
said.
   The dead, seven crew members and three passengers, were all
Sudanese nationals, said Mike Fernandez, an official with Trade
Winds Express Ltd., the Kenyan company handling the jetliner's
cargo.
   He said their identities were not immediately known but that the
passengers apparently were working with the relief effort.
   The Boeing 707 was arriving from Sudan's capital, Khartoum, to
pick up emergency relief supplies destined for famine-threatened
southern Sudan when it crashed at 4:18 a.m., said B.A. Omuse,
director of Kenyan airports.
   The aircraft overshot the runway at Jomo Kenyatta International
Airport once and was making a second attempt at landing when it
crashed, said Fernandez.
   The plane hit electric cables and a post supporting the power
lines, but it was not known if that is what caused the crash, said
the airport source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Debris was spread over a wide area in an empty field about two
miles from the runway. Nobody was injured on the ground, Omuse
said.
   The plane was chartered from Sudania, a Sudanese company, by
Trans Arabian Transport, also of Sudan. The aircraft was to ferry
emergency food belonging to the Lutheran World Federation.
   G.M. Shaba, in charge of operations at the Lutheran World
Federation's office in Nairobi, said the aircraft was scheduled to
begin hauling emergency food to Juba in southern Sudan today.
   The Lutheran World Federation is one of the few relief agencies
still delivering emergency supplies to Juba, which is controlled by
the government but surrounded by rebels of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army.

<HEAD>China Charges 11 With Counterrevolutionary Crimes, Two on Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About a dozen major figures in last year's
pro-democracy movement have been charged with counterrevolutionary
crimes, and two have been put on trial, a court official and a
Chinese source said today.
   Fan Shumi, a spokeswoman for the Beijing Intermediate Court,
said two students, Zhang Ming and Zheng Xuguang, went on trial late
last week but their sentences have yet to be handed down.
   The two students were among 21 on China's most-wanted list and
were charged with propagating and inciting counterrevolution.
   ``It was an open trial, but it's not over yet,'' Fan said,
declining to give any other details.
   A public trial is guaranteed by the Chinese constitution.
However, the court decides who can attend a trial, and permission
usually is granted only to the defendant's employers and faily.
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, responding to U.S. concerns about
human rights in China, said this week in Washington: ``Legal
proceedings against Chinese criminals are a matter for China's
courts and foreign powers cannot interfere.''
   Zheng, 21, a student at Beijing Aeronautics Institute, was
arrested a month after the June 1989 military crackdown on the
popular movement. Zhang, 25, was a student at Qinghua University's
automotive engineering department.
   In addition to the two students, nine other important figures in
last year's pro-democracy movement are known to have been charged
in the past three weeks.
   University professor Liu Xiaobo's family was notified on Nov. 17
that he was charged with propogating and inciting
counterrevolution, friends said.
   Liu, who returned from the United States to take part in last
year's student-led protests, staged a hunger strike to protest the
imposition of martial law in Beijing in the last days of the
movement. He has been regularly and harshly criticized in the
Chinese press since his arrest three weeks after the military
crackdown.
   Wang Dan, No. 1 on the most-wanted list, also has been charged,
a source said today, speaking on condition of anonymity. Wang, 21,
a history student at Beijing University, was one of the top student
leaders of the seven-week movement.
   Legal proceedings also have begun against Liu Gang, 28, No. 3 on
the most-wanted list, the source said. Liu, who was unemployed, was
formerly a graduate student in the physics of Beijing University,
one of the hot spots during the movement.
   Also charged were Liu Suli, 32, a university professor; Bao
Zunxin, a philosopher; Chen Xiaoping, a Beijing University
professor; and Lu Jiamin, a professor at the China Labor College
and a participant in the 1978 Democracy Wall movement, the source
said.
   Other Chinese sources have said that Chen Zeming, 37, and Wang
Juntao, 32, were charged with plotting to overthrow the government.
   Neither was active in the pro-democracy movement, but they have
been accused in the official media of being ``black hands'' who
manipulated the students in an effort to topple the government.
Chen was the publisher of a now-banned weekly. Wang was its editor.

   About 88 Americans remain as so-called ``human
shields'' in Iraq after the release of 15 others last weekend, the
State Department says.
   The 88 are being held at strategic sites in Iraq. They are among
the roughly 1,000 Americans who are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, the
department says.
   The Americans include personnel at the U.S. embassies in Baghdad
and Kuwait City as well as the ``human shields'' and other people
in hiding.
   The 15 Americans released over the weekend left Iraq in the
company of former boxing champion Mohammed Ali.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the department spokeswoman, said Monday that
10 of the 15 people who flew out of Baghdad on Saturday had special
medical conditions. Once in Amman, Jordan, the group broke up, with
six planning to fly to New York late Monday. The others went on to
Amsterdam, Netherlands and then to the United States.
   Tutwiler said six Americans in Baghdad are visited regularly at
the Mansour Melia Hotel by U.S. Embassy officials.
   Tutwiler also said the United States has not received any
additional information about Americans in Kuwait being rounded up
over the weekend. But she said house-to-house searches in Kuwait
continue.

   Baghdad backed away from its confrontation with Moscow today,
saying it would allow almost 3,300 Soviets stranded in Iraq to
leave, but it demanded the Kremlin pay compensation for canceling
their work contracts.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze had warned that
Moscow, which has not sent troops to join the U.S.-led
multinational force stationed in the Persian Gulf, would use
military force if its citizens were harmed.
   Meanwhile, former world boxing champion Muhammad Ali and six
Americans who had been detained in Iraq arrived in New York early
this morning.
   As Iraq apparently tries to chip away at the world alliance
arrayed against it by releasing hostages on a piecemeal basis,
Senate Democrats for a fifth day expressed reservations over the
Bush administration's gulf policy.
   Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said on Monday that the U.N. trade sanctions against
Iraq should be given more time to work before Washington considers
war to liberate Kuwait.
   But Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told Congress that military
action was the only sure way to drive Iraq from the oil-rich
emirate.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said today that the Soviets,
mainly oil industry experts, will be allowed to leave beginning
Wednesday. It said, however, Moscow would have to pay compensation
for broken contracts.
   Moscow last week accused Iraq of breaking a promise to allow
Soviets to leave. The accusation came as Moscow adopted a harder
line against Iraq.
   The Kremlin was Iraq's main arms supplier and chief ally before
the gulf crisis began on Aug. 2.
   In Moscow, presidential spokesman Vitaly Ignatenko said 3,232
Soviets remain in Iraq. Thousands more left in the two months after
the invasion.
   Iraq is holding hundreds of Westerners, many at strategic sites
to prevent an attack by the 340,000-strong U.S.-led multinational
force deployed in the gulf. Soviets are not believed among those
used as ``human shields.''
   The British Foreign Office said today that Iraq sent Britain a
$289,000 hotel bill to pay for 27 British construction workers it
is holding at two five-star Baghdad hotels.
   The British Embassy in Baghdad will pick up the tab, a Foreign
Office spokesman said, but claim that money back from Iraq after
the crisis ends.
   Meanwhile, about 30 Britons and Irishmen who returned home
Monday said foreigners being held in Baghdad are depressed and
bored, but are finding enough food and managing to get by. Six of
the Britons were among the 15 Saddam Hussein freed in response to a
request from former boxing great, Ali.
   Desptte Iraq's refusal to allow most Westerners to leave Iraq
and Kuwait, Senate Democrats insisted Monday that the sanctions be
given more time to work.
   ``If we go to war, we never will know whether they would have
worked,'' said Nunn, who has criticized the president's decision to
increase the number of U.S. troops in the region from 240,000 to
more than 440,000 by mid-January. Iraq has stationed an estimated
430,000 soldiers in southern Iraq and Kuwait.
   But Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, told Senate hearings Monday that Saddam could survive the
embargo.
   ``Given the nature of the regime, given Saddam Hussein's
brutality to his own people, his very tight control of that
society, his ability to allocate resources for the military, their
ability to produce their own food ... he can ride them out,''
Cheney said.
   But Iraq insisted Monday the sanctions were working.
   Health Minister Abdul-Salam Mohammed Saeed said 1,400 children
under the age of 5 have died because of shortages of medicine,
vaccines and food brought on by the embargo. But doctors and
Western diplomats in Baghdad disagreed, saying there were no
shortages of food or basic medicines in the country.
   In other developments:
   -U.S. military spokesmen in Saudi Arabia today denied that
American troops could not display the U.S. flag on their uniforms
for fear of offending Saudis. The spokesmen said that in a recent
incident the commanding officer of a Florida National Guard unit
asked his troops to take off the flag in error.
   -Pope John Paul II told Italian sailors today that the crises in
the gulf and elsewhere in the Middle East must be resolved through
dialogue.
   -Defense ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council
alliance met today in Saudi Arabia to review their strategy in the
standoff with Iraq. The council's members include Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.

   The head of Japan's public broadcasting system said
he wants to create a global news network to counter the spread of
Cable News Network to dozens of countries.
   ``I don't mean to bad-mouth Mr. Turner, but CNN is trying to
force U.S. news on the rest of the world,'' NHK Chairman Keiji
Shima said Monday, referring to CNN head Ted Turner.
   Under Shima's plan, broadcasters from Asia, Europe and North
America would be responsible for eight-hour daily segments focusing
on their own region.
   Shima said he believed Asians should cover issues about Asia,
but he did not give a detailed explanation why. He also said there
was not enough news about the region being broadcast to other parts
of the globe.
   Shima, in a speech to foreign reporters, acknowledged that the
British Broadcasting Corp. has shown little interest in his
proposal. But he said other major broadcasters have expressed
interest.
   He did not identify those broadcasters, however, and an NHK
spokeswoman said the names could not be released because
negotiations were under way.
   Shima provided no concrete details of his plan, but said he
hoped such a network could be set up in about six months.
   NHK has two channels on Japanese television, one with general
programming and the other featring educational fare. It also has
two stations for satellite broadcasting. The programming on those
stations includes news broadcasts from several different countries.

   U.S. agencies acted in a ``grossly negligent''
and ``unacceptable'' manner by failing to investigate terrorism as
a possible cause of a plane crash that killed 256 Americans, most
of them soldiers, a congressional report said today.
   The aftermath of the 1985 crash in Gander, Newfoundland, was
marked by ``a near-total absence'' of U.S. participation in the
Canadian probe of the tragedy, said the study by the staff of the
House Judiciary subcommittee on crime.
   ``We found no evidence that there was an investigation of
possible terrorism'' by either the United States or Canada, added
the report, which formed the basis for a subcommittee hearing
today.
   ``Incredibly, no U.S. government agency, or at least none with
official responsibility, demonstrated any determination to find out
just what caused the crash,'' subcommittee Chairman William Hughes,
D-N.J., said at the hearing.
   ``The National Transportation Safety Board, and other agencies
of the U.S. government, chose to sit back and watch as the Canadian
efforts became embroiled in controversy,'' Hughes said.
   ``The NTSB routinely rubber-stamped the Canadian findings,
without comment,'' Hughes added.
   The Canadian Air Safety Board found by a 5-4 vote that icing of
the wings was the most probable cause, but a subsequent Canadian
review found that ice had not been the cause. The U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board nonetheless supported the original
finding blaming it on ice.
   ``The NTSB was grossly negligent and was not acting in the
public's interest for taking such a position,'' said the
congressional report. ``It appears that the NTSB was predisposed to
not find fault.''
   FBI agents sent to Gander the day of the crash apparently
``waited in a ... motel for whatever reports or conclusions
Canadian authorities saw fit to share with them,'' said the staff
report, which has not been voted on by subcommittee members.
   After 36 hours, the FBI agents accepted a declaration that
terrorism was not involved and returned home, apparently without
getting any evidence to bolster that conclusion, it added.
   ``Such a course of conduct on the part of the FBI is ...
unacceptable if not also unbelievable,'' the report contended.
   Spokesmen for the NTSB and FBI declined comment. Both agencies
were sending representatives to testify at the hearing.
   The DC-8 jetliner crashed on Dec. 12, 1985, less than 30 seconds
after liftoff from the airport at Gander.
   The chartered flight, operated by Miami-based Arrow Air, was
carrying soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division home from
peacekeeping duties in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.
   Rep Robin Tallon, D-S.C., has said the crash could be connected
to the Iran-Contra affair. He suggests the plane may have been the
target of a terrorist attack as a reprisal stemming from Iran's
unhappiness with a weapons shipment authorized by the Reagan
administration less than three weeks earlier.
   Fueling the notion of a terrorist act:
   -Eyewitnesses claim to have seen a bright orange object in the
sky at the time of the crash.
   -Shortly after the plane went down in Gander, an anonymous
caller said that Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian terrorist group, had
put a bomb on the plane.
   -A pathologist found that lethal levels of carbon monoxide and
hydrogen cyanide in many of the victims' bodies had been inhaled
before death, as would be the case in a pre-impact fire.

   U.S. military spokesmen denied
today that American troops were prohibited from displaying the U.S.
flag on their uniforms to avoid offending the Saudi government.
   They said that in a recent incident the commanding officer of a
Florida National Guard unit had asked his troops to remove the flag
in error. The officer, his unit, and the date of the incident were
not identified.
   All troops bound for Saudi Arabia are briefed on the cultural
sensitivities in the strict Moslem nation, which bans the mingling
of the sexes in public and bars alcohol. In the past, strong ties
with the United States have never been emphasized publicly because
of Washington's links to Israel.
   One military spokesman said that some commanding officers take
the warnings further than the regulations.
   ``In trying not to offend someone, in being sensitive ... they
err on the side of caution,'' said Capt. Mike Sherman of the U.S.
military's Joint Information Bureau. ``It was just a bad word that
the commanding officer got.'' The military said a similar false
report that letters mailed with stamps showing the American flag
would not be delivered had swept through military ranks earlier
this year.
   U.S. military positions in Saudi Arabia are barred from flying
the American flag, according to a policy by the Central Command in
Riyadh.
   ``They are encampments rather than bases on the sovereign
territory of Saudi Arabia,'' said Lt. Commander David Knox, a
spokesman for Central Command.
   It would not be appropriate to fly the flag, implying that the
area was under American control, he said, and is standard military
policy worldwide.
   Troops may, however, display the flag on the walls of their
living quarters, in offices, on their uniforms or anywhere else if
their commanding officer approves, he said.
   Knox said he was unaware of any Saudi concern over such displays
of the Stars and Stripes.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Poland's powerful Roman
Catholic Church has made clear that believers should vote for Lech
Walesa in the presidential runoff election, a newspaper reported
today.
   Cardinal Jozef Glemp, asked about challenger Stanislaw
Tyminski's claim Saturday of church support, said in Rome that the
communique on Sunday's election issued recently by Polish bishops
gave no ground for that interpretation, the Zycie Warszawy daily
reported.
   ``Nobody believes that,'' Glemp said. He said the bishops spoke
for ``continuity in the direction of independence and freedom that
has been outlined for the last 10 years.''
   Glemp's words ``leave us without doubt,'' Zycie Warszawy said in
a related commentary. ``They fully uphold support for Lech Walesa.
In these short words the highest moral authority expressed a clear
and decided message.''
   It added that the church speaks so clearly ``only at moments
decisive for the future of the country.''
   In a country where more than 90 percent of the people consider
themselves Catholic, the church endorsement should carry great
weight and could be fatal for Tyminski's come-from-nowhere
presidential bid.
   The bishops issued their statement Friday from the Jasna Gora
monastery in Czestochowa, telling Poles they should elect someone
who would ``continue and consolidate'' the course of reforms and
``discover anew the meaning of solidarity.''
   It was read in all churches Sunday, and at least some pastors
were reported to have added their own private instructions to vote
for Walesa.
   In the first round of the elections Nov. 25, in which Tyminski
placed second among six candidates, he did particularly well among
rural voters.
   But in the Polish countryside, the pastor often plays a pivotal
role in advising the largely closed-off population about public
affairs, so a clear endorsement of Walesa should help the
Solidarity chairman.
   On nationwide television Saturday night, Tyminski said: ``I read
the bishops' letter ... and I think it was support for my candidacy
because I am also striving to end this totalitarian system.''
   Asked at a news conference today whether the church was
supporting Walesa, Tyminski's Peruvian wife, Graciela, answered:
``This is between Mr. Walesa and Mr. Tyminski. Where is his
(Walesa's) plan for the future of the country?
   ``Forget about the church,'' she said.
   Public opinion polls show Walesa leading Tyminski by a 2-to-1
margin.
   However, Tyminski said at the news conference that he believes
in his own polls, which he said put Walesa's support at 50 percent
and his at 44 percent. He added that he is gaining about 1.5

   Fred Guyor didn't think twice about what
to do when Northwest Flight 1482 collided with another jet and
ignited. He jumped off a wing to the runway and started helping
others to safety.
   Monday's collision at Detroit Metropolitan Airport sent the 39
passengers on the Pittsburgh-bound flight clambering for exits.
Eight people died and at least 20 others were treated for burns,
broken bones, smoke inhalation and other injuries.
   ``I didn't even know what was happening. I saw a ball of flame.
When this thing went, it was like an explosion. The whole tail of
the plane was engulfed in flames,'' said Guyor, 53, of the Detroit
suburb of Southfield. He was reading a newspaper when the collision
occurred.
   ``I never knew there was another plane involved,'' he said.
   The DC-9, also carrying four crew members, was clipped by the
wing of a Boeing 727-200, Memphis-bound Flight 299, with 146
passengers and 10 crew members. The collision knocked off one of
the DC-9 rear engines.
   Guyer leapt from his aisle seat, out a middle escape door and
dropped about 9 feet to the slushy runway.
   Once on the ground, he helped six to eight others off the plane,
including a few people who were afraid to jump off the wing. A
passenger jumped into his hands with a burning nylon jacket.
   ``I used both hands to beat out the fire,'' he said. ``I got
nylon melted all over my fingers. I pulled my skin off.''
   Guyor, manager of steel-making maintenance operations at the
Great Lakes division of National Steel Corp. in Ecorse, said he
declined medical treatment.

<HEAD>Elizabeth Taylor's Van Gogh Painting Fails to Sell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vincent van Gogh painting owned by Elizabeth
Taylor failed to sell at auction when bidding did not reach the
minimum acceptable price.
   Bidding on ``View of the Asylum and Chapel at St. Remy'' started
at $9.6 million and reached $11.14 million, Christie's said, but
did not achieve the undisclosed reserve price. The auction house
had expected the painting to fetch between $15 million and $19
million.
   Painted in 1889, the work depicts the asylum where Vincent van
Gogh committed himself toward the end of his troubled life. The
actress bought it in 1963 for about $165,000.
   The demand for van Gogh's work has grown since 1987, when
``Sunflowers'' sold for about $40 million. The record price for a
van Gogh was about $57 million, paid for a ``Portrait of Dr.
Gachet'' in May.
   A Christie's spokesman said he believed the current world
economic climate was partly responsible for the failure of Miss
Taylor's painting to reach the minimum price, but added: ``There is
still a strong art market.''
   The painting was shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York, as part of a van Gogh exhibition in 1986-87.
   Miss Taylor did not attend the sale.

<HEAD>Zambia's President Fires Defense Minister, Editors of State Papers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Kenneth Kaunda today announced
the dismissals of his defense minister and the veteran chief
editors of Zambia's two state-run daily newspapers.
   The editors, both of whom held their posts for more than 10
years, had sometimes been criticized for not reflecting the line of
the ruling United National Independence Party.
   Kaunda's party has been the only lawful one since 1973, but he
has promised multiparty elections next year.
   The president, who announced the dismissals at a news
conference, gave no reason for them.
   He said the defense minister, Lt. Gen. Hannaniah Lungu, would be
replaced by his deputy, Dodson Siatalimi. Lungu, appointed defense
chief in July after helping to crush a coup attempt, will probably
be transferred to the foreign service, Kaunda said. Lungu was
previously commander of the air force.
   The fired editors are Komani Kachinga of the Times of Zambia and
Cyrus Sikazwe of the Zambia Daily Mail. They said they were
surprised by the move but expressed no resentment.
   Under mounting pressure from trade union leaders, academics,
students and former political loyalists, Kaunda recently agreed torewrite
the constitution and restore the kind of Western-style
democracy he inherited from Britain at independence in 1964.
   But the 66-year-old leader has ordered the two dailies, as well
as state television and radio not to report on opposition
activities.
   Kaunda named two academics to replace the editors, and some
analysts suggested their lack of journalism experience might make
it easier for the government to shape the coverage according to its
own wishes.
   An opposition newspaper, the Sunday Express, which was to have
been launched this week, did not appear on the streets after a
state company refused to print it. The paper has since found a
private printer, the publishers said.

   Police said they arrested 100 demonstrators when
a protest against the federal Centers for Disease Control's
definition of AIDS turned destructive.
   ``They were allowed to demonstrate until they began defacing CDC
property,'' said DeKalb County police Maj. J.S. Wilson. ``They
painted the building. They beat on the windows and chained
themselves to the front entry doors.''
   The protesters contend the health agency's AIDS definition costs
women health benefits by failing to include some gynecological
conditions that afflict women infected with the AIDS virus.
   The AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power said 700 people from 30
states participated in the demonstration. Police estimated the
crowd at 300.
   About 100 were arrested for criminal trespass and a variety of
other charges, police said.
   The protesters, wearing placards depicting skulls, marched in
the rain through the Emory University campus to the nearby CDC
complex Monday morning.
   Another group was detained after they invaded the CDC executive
offices about three miles away, Wilson said.
   ACT UP said in a statement that the demonstration included 30
women infected with HIV who spoke of ``how the out-of-date
definition based on the history of men diagnosed with AIDS excludes
them.''
   Of the 154,917 people diagnosed with AIDS, 14,816 are women,
said CDC spokesman Chuck Fallis.
   He said the agency was studying whether it's a sign of AIDS or
just a coincidence that some HIV-infected women get diseases such
as pelvic inflammatory disease and vaginal candidiasis.
   ``We are continuing to look at this whole spectrum of AIDS in
women including these gynecological conditions. We may at some
point expand our case definition, but we're not ready to do that at
this point,'' he said.
   As for the protesters, he said: ``They're saying that we are
letting women die ... and that CDC doesn't care about the fate of
women with HIV. It seems rather absurd to me.''

<HEAD>Fed Eliminates Some Bank Reserve Requirements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve, in a move designed to
ease the so-called ``credit crunch,'' announced today it is
eliminating bank reserve requirements on some deposits.
   ``The board took action at this time ... in response to mounting
evidence that commercial banks have been tightening their standards
of creditworthiness and the terms and conditions for many types of
loans,'' the announcement said.
   ``While much of this tightening has been welcome from a safety
and soundness standpoint, it has in recent months begun to exert a
contractionary influence on the economy,'' it added.
   There currently is a 3 percent reserve requirement on
non-personal time deposits maturing in less than 18 months, which
are mostly corporate CDs, and net Eurocurrency liabilities. The
requirement means banks have to hold in reserve sums equal to 3
percent of the amount.
   Both requirements will be lowered to zero in coming weeks.
   The Fed said lower reserve requirements reduce bank costs and
provide incentives to lend to creditworthy borrowers, ``thus
countering, to some extent, the recent tightening in credit
terms.''
   Both Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady have said tight credit is causing
problems for many businesses.
   Some critics contend government officials are being overzealous
in interpreting banking regulations in the wake of the savings and
bond debacle. Brady has urged regulators not to be
``unrealistically negative'' in evaluating loans and urged bankers
``to keep lending to your good customers.''

<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos called
today for sweeping economic and political reforms and told his
ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola its
15-year-old, one-party rule will soon be over.
   Dos Santos told 700 Popular Movement delegates the party's third
congress that opened today will be ``the last under a single-party
system.''
   In a 30-minute speech interrupted by frequent applause, dos
Santos said the Popular Movement must abandon its Marxist economic
model to embrace the free market and a new strategy of democratic
socialism.
   The six-day congress is scheduled to debate proposals for
reforming the centralized economy and introducing multiparty
democracy.
   Delegates will also discuss ongoing peace talks with U.S.-backed
UNITA rebels to end a 15-year-old civil war that has devastated
what is potentially one of Africa's richest economies.
   After a fifth round of peace talks between the two sides last
month, Portuguese government mediators said they were close to a
cease-fire.
   Dos Santos said today that political advances will be difficult
while the war continues with UNITA, the Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   He has said plans to introduce a multiparty system will go ahead
early next year, even without an agreement with the rebels.
   Peace talks are expected to resume in January.
   Dos Santos criticized the centrally planned economic system
followed by the Popular Movement since Angola's independence from
Portugal in 1975. ``The inadequacy of the system is showing in an
economic asphyxiation because of the high level of collectivism of
the means of production and services,'' he said.
   Angola is rich in minerals and agricultural land, but the war
has crippled economic activity and severed communications. Only
exports from the heavily-guarded northwestern oil fields have kept
the economy afloat.
   Dos Santos faces resistance to his reform plans from party
hard-liners.
   Observers in Luanda said opposition to some planned changes may
delay their discussion until a special party congress early next
year.
   Dos Santos hopes to strengthen his hand at the current congress
in elections for members of the policy-making Central Committee and
a new position of party general secretary.
   Expected to win the post is dos Santos' special assistant and
leading reformer, Lopo de Nascimento.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Sex Discrimination Ruling Against Accounting Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who sued Price Waterhouse for sex
discrimination won another round today in her bid to be made a
partner in the accounting firm and receive back pay.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
upheld a lower court's order that Anne Hopkins be made a partner of
Price Waterhouse and that she receive $371,000 in back pay.
   The ruling stems from an important 1989 Supreme Court decision
that employers have the burden or proving they did not discriminate
when there is evidence of bias.
   The high court's decision in the Hopkins case came after she
presented evidence that she was denied a partnership because male
partners felt she acted too much like a man.
   The Supreme Court sent the case back to U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell, who last May ordered Price Waterhouse to make
Ms. Hopkins a partner in its Washington-based management consulting
group.
   The appellate court decision upheld Gesell's finding that Price
Waterhouse failed to prove that it denied Ms. Hopkins a partnership
for a non-discriminatory reason.
   The appellate panel said it found ``no merit'' in Price
Waterhouse's appeal of Gesell's order.

   Sales of new homes decreased another 3.5
percent in October, falling to a level not seen since the last
recession, the government said today.
   Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 491,000, the
Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development said in a
joint release.
   That was the lowest since 480,000 new homes were sold in October
1982, a month before the 1981-82 recession ended.
   The housing industry has been in a slump for about two years
because of high interest rates and home prices and, more recently,
fading consumer confidence in the economy.
   During the first 10 months of this year, new home sales were off
15.8 percent from the same period of 1989. Sales fell in eight of
those 10 months, including a 4 percent drop in September and a 2
percent decline in August.
   The September figure was revised down from 6 percent in the
departments' initial estimate, but the October total was worse than
the 1.8 percent drop first reported.
   At the October sales pace, it would take 8.4 months to exhaust
the inventory of unsold homes, up from 8.3 months in September and
eight months in August. There was a seven month supply of unsold
homes in October 1989.
   The effects of the sluggishness were seen in the Labor
Department's employment report for October. It said 185,000
construction jobs have been lost in the last five months, including
80,000 in October alone.
   Existing home sales also have been weak, slumping 4.7 percent in
October to an annual rate of 3.02 million, their lowest level since
early 1985, according to the National Association of Realtors.
   But despite the weakness, new home prices continued to rise in
October.
   The government reported the median price jumped 7.9 percent, to
$121,800, while the average price advanced 9.8 percent, to
$157,500. The median means half of the homes cost more, half less.
   A year ago, the median price was $123,000 and the average
$147,800.
   Sales in the Northeast, which tumbled to a recent low of 57,000
units in September, rebounded 47.4 percent in October to an annual
rate of 84,000 units.
   Sales fell 18.2 percent, to 112,000 units, in the West - the
lowest since 106,000 homes were sold in September 1982. In the
Midwest, sales were off 11.7 percent, to 83,000 units - the lowest
since 74,000 homes were sold in August 1986.
   Sales dropped 4.1 percent in the South, to 212,000 units.

<TEXT>
   The Navy today announced it is forcing the
chief of the Naval Air Systems Command to retire early because he
failed to inform top Pentagon officials of serious flaws in the
proposed A-12 stealth bomber program.
   Vice Adm. Richard C. Gentz will retire no later than Feb. 1,
1991, the Pentagon said.
   The A-12 program executive officer, Rear Adm. John F. Calvert,
and the program manager, Capt. Lawrence G. Elberfeld, have also
been reassigned to other duties and received letters of censure
from Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III.
   Garrett informed Defense Secretary Dick Cheney of the actions in
a memo released by the Pentagon today.
   The Navy secretary told Cheney he acted on the basis of an
internal Navy inquiry into the A-12 program, which is a year behind
schedule and at least $1 billion over its anticipated development
budget of $4.8 billion.
   The A-12, a classified program, is the Navy's top priority for
future aircraft development. The carrier-based airplane is
scheduled to enter operation in 1995.
   The Navy inquiry said a key failure of the senior Navy officers
responsible for overseeing the A-12 program was their unwillingness
to pass on negative news about the project's problems to higher
officials and to top Pentagon civilian leaders.
   Copies of a report of the Navy inquiry's conclusions, as well as
a separate report on the A-12 program by the Pentagon Inspector
General, also were released today.
   The inspector general's report was highly critical of the role
of John A. Betti, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition.
It said he put too much credence in assurances by the contractors
that the project could be completed on time and within the cost
ceiling, and that he dismissed warnings by lower-level Pentagon
officials that the project was encountering serious problems.
   ``We find Mr. Betti's failure especially troublesome in view of
a prior warning within the (Office of the Secretary of Defense) of
cost growth on the A-12 program,'' Susan J. Crawford, the inspector
general, wrote in a letter to Rep. Andy Ireland, R-Fla.
   Ireland, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said in
a statement released today that the inspector general's report
illustrated a fundamental flaw in the Pentagon's system of
assigning responsibility for weapons development.
   ``Program managers are giving assurances about contractors'
adherence to budgets based largely on the word of the contractors
themselves,'' he wrote. ``It is a process ripe for abuse.''

   Columbia's astronauts repaired
NASA's $150 million observatory today and slowly began using it to
study stars after losing more than a day of precious star-gazing
time.
   Mission specialist Robert Parker said this morning that all
three star trackers in the instrument pointing system finally
appeared to be working well.
   One of the trackers still needed more fine-tuning, said flight
director Bob Castle. Nevertheless, the crew started using the
automatic pointing system and reported it was ``steady as a rock.''
   Mission scientist Ted Gull said it would be several days before
the observatory is working at ``100 percent.'' As a result, targets
of low priority will be dropped, he said.
   ``We're really in a stage where the observatory is really
starting to come alive,'' Gull said. ``It's a lot later than where
we wanted to be. But I see no major show-toppers.''
   By manually operating the system, the astronauts were able to
look briefly at star clusters early today and a distant galaxy and
two stars Monday. More than 10 percent of the shuttle mission's 230
planned observations will have to be scrapped because of the
earlier problems in aligning three of the Astro observatory's four
telescopes, Gull said.
   Astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman spotted space station Mir through
binoculars late this morning and said it appeared as a small point
of light. Mir was orbiting 32 miles above Columbia with four
cosmonauts and a Japanese television reporter.
   The 10-day mission, which began with liftoff early Sunday, was
already six months behind schedule because of five launch
postponements, four of them caused by hydrogen leaks in Columbia
and one by problems with Astro.
   Observatory repairs were delayed for a few hours Monday when a
computer aboard Columbia malfunctioned after a faulty message was
included in a series of commands from Earth. After the computer
crash, one of the three star trackers failed to return to operating
condition, NASA said.
   The astronauts got some viewing time in Monday and today by
manually operating the system and by aligning the three ultraviolet
telescopes with the help of a fourth star tracker normally used to
keep the shuttle aligned.
   That process is awkward, time-consuming and not as precise, but
it enabled the astronauts to focus one of the telescopes today on
two merged star clusters, each of which has 100,000 to 1 million
stars. All three telescopes pointed on a nearby star Monday
evening.
   ``That is a milestone. How about that?'' said Hoffman.
   To operate the system manually overnight, Parker used a
joystick, or paddle, and astronaut Ron Parise typed onto a computer
keyboard.
   ``Give me a paddle and a telescope and I can move the
universe,'' Parker joked.
   On Monday, the astronauts manually pointed all three telescopes
at a white dwarf star with a powerful magnetic field.
   The astronauts also pointed one telescope at a galaxy 60 million
light years away to look for evidence of a black hole. The
observation lasted only a few seconds instead of a half hour
because of the imprecise manual operation.
   ``We're seeing some science. We're very confident about the
instruments,'' mission manager Jack Jones said.
   ``It's enough to tell us the telescope is working great, and
we're excited about how well we're going to do once the instrument
pointing system starts pointing,'' said Arthur Davidsen of Johns
Hopkins, the telescope's principal investigator.
   Columbia's mission mission is the first in five years dedicated
entirely to scientific research.
   Astro's X-ray telescope was unaffected by the trouble since it
has its own pointing system. It was expected to start making
scientific observations once it was calibrated.
   Scientists want to use the observatory to study X-rays and
ultraviolet rays emitted from high-energy objects. Those rays
cannot penetrate Earth's atmosphere.
   Astro, which is in the shuttle's cargo bay, is expected to look
at stars, quasars, galaxies, Jupiter, a supernova and Comet Levy.
   Columbia was supposed to carry Astro into orbit in March 1986.
The flight was delayed indefinitely by the Challenger accident two
months earlier.

   A group of Czechoslovak soldiers
mailed themselves packages of explosives they stole from a military
warehouse, apparently to make fireworks for New Year's Eve, a
newspaper said Tuesday.
   The contents of the packages were discovered when one parcel was
accidentally damaged by the post office, the newspaper said.
   It quoted police as saying that three soldiers broke into an
army ammunition warehouse last week. They shared the munitions they
stole with four other soldiers, the report said.
   The seven were soon to finish their military service and mailed
the ammunition to their home addresses in five packages, apparently
to make fireworks out of them for New Year's Eve.
   ``Because grenades were packaged next to detonators, which can
explode on a small impulse, there was certainly a danger of
explosion,'' the daily quoted police Capt. Emil Holub as saying.
   The newspaper said police recovered two of the packages on
Saturday and two more on Monday. The fifth package was still in the
mail, probably somewhere in Slovakia, the paper quoted police as
saying.

cultural attache Zhou Hua had left a ``letter of resignation'' at
the consulate before disappearing on Nov. 25 with his wife, Susan.
   ``His way of doing it is very wrong,'' Wang said. ``We hope he
comes back.''
   Susan Zhou's term in Australia as a Radio Beijing correspondent
was reported to have expired last month.
   Australian immigration spokesman Victor Boulos said Tuesday that
two officials from the Chinese consulate in Sydney recently
approached his department with a number of questions.
   ``They were counseled on their situation,'' he said, adding that
he could not disclose their names, their questions or the advice
given to the pair.

   Police said Tuesday 321 people
were injured when a train crashed into the back of another train in
Soweto.
   A police spokesman said one train had stopped and the other ran
into it between stations in Soweto, a black township just outside
Johannesburg. The two commuter trains were packed with passengers.
   The crash was under investigation, the police spokesman said.
   Scores of people were treated at local hospitals and released,

   Prime Minister Alphonse
Souchlaty-Poaty has resigned in a dispute over government policy,
an official communique says.
   The prime minister, who quit Monday, had reportedly differed
with President Denis Sassou Nguesso over how to respond to pressure
for political reform and for establishment of a multiparty system.
   Sassou Nguesso's ruling Congolese Labor Party opened a national
congress today. Souchlaty-Poaty, who was named prime minister in
August 1989, also resigned from the party.
   An official communique said the prime minister resigned because
of ``profound differences arising from the search for solutions to
the political crisis throughout the country.''
   Sassou Nguesso, whose government has been beset by a wave of
strikes and political protests, said in an opening speech to the
four-day party congress that the Congo needed ``new men.''
   But he said opposition leaders, who have been pressing for a
faster transition to a multiparty system, were guilty of spreading
``lies and calumnies'' about the government.
   Sassou Nguesso had proposed that a new, transitional government
be formed in January, with a multiparty system to be established
later in the year.

<HEAD>Mines Explode As Bulldozer Clears War Rubble From Former Beirut
Battlefront</HEAD>

   A bulldozer roared into the ruined,
mine-strewn former urban battleground in the heart of Beirut on
Tuesday to remove the fortifications and rubble of 15{ years of
civil war.
   Stray dogs emerged from shell-shattered buildings, barking
furiously as the huge yellow machine began demolishing an earth
embankment that split the Chrisian and Moslem sectors of the
capital.
   Martyr's Square and surrounding streets, the former business
center of Beirut, were part of the no man's land that became
overgrown with bushes and small trees sprouting from cracks in
pavement.
   Two small anti-personnel mines exploded under the bulldozer's
chains as it went to work. The bulldozer was not affected by the
small blasts, but a Lebanese army captain ordered work stopped
until troops cleared the area.
   ``Luckily there were no anti-tank mines planted in this part of
the Green Line,'' said an army captain, referring to the
demarcation line that once divided the city. ``Such mines would
have wrecked the bulldozer.''
   The army deployed in downtown Beirut on Monday in the first
phase of a government plan to reunify the capital and end the civil
warfare that has killed more than 150,000 people.
   The area around Martyr's Square just north of the port of Beirut
was the scene of some of the war's most savage battles as Christian
and Moslem militias clashed repeatedly for control.
   The crumbling facades of the old multistory buildings fronting
on the square are peppered with bullet and shellholes, their
interiors gutted by fire and shells.
   A rusty popcorn machine, scarred with bullet and shrapnel holes,
stood on the sidewalk outside the Roxy movie theater beneath a sign
proclaiming ``non-stop showings.''
   Another small sign on the first floor of the Roxy building, also
full of bullet holes, said ``Music lessons for 30 pounds a month.''
   ``I wonder if they will teach music here again. Anyway, it won't
be for 30 pounds a month,'' said the army captain, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The civil war shattered Lebanon's booming economy. The Lebanese
pound, once the most stable currency in the Middle East, fell from
its prewar value of 2.5 to the U.S. dollar to 1,250 to the dollar
in August.
   The currency began regaining strength after the rival sides
accepted an Arab League-brokered peace plan requiring them to
withdraw from Beirut as the first step in a pacification program.
The militia withdrawal started last month and was considered
completed in the greater Beirut area Monday.
   On Tuesday, the Lebanese pound traded at 690 to the dollar.
   Despite the withdrawal of most militiamen, armed troops of the
Lebanese Forces militia of Christian warlord Samir Geagea remained
in control of the port area of Beirut. They prevented reporters
from entering the area, saying they had not been ordered to
withdraw.
   A source at Geagea's headquarters who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the Lebanese Forces men would be withdrawn from the
port area as part of a plan to return control of all Lebanese ports
to the government.
   There are 12 ports now held by various militias, and the
government plans to retake control of them after the unification of
Beirut.
   Later, the peace plan calls for disbanding the Christian and
Moslem militias and imposing government authority nationwide.

<HEAD>A Different Bagdad Sleeps</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BAGDAD, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There was once another Bagdad, along
another oil-rich gulf, facing U.S. troops.
   It was a boom-town border port at the mouth of the Rio Grande, a
city of 10,000 that thrived by exporting Confederate tobacco and
cotton, evading the Union blockade of Southern ports.
   In 1866, after the Civil War, Mexican officials were fighting
for control of the town and one faction invited 1,000 American
soldiers from the other side of the river to help.
   But the soldiers stayed for 20 days of looting - a debacle that
got their commander imprisoned when he returned to the United
States.
   ``The sack was so total, it was as if Bagdad had been taken from
one side of the river to the other,'' says Mexico's Porrua
Encyclopedia.
   The Iraqi capital, Baghdad, also has suffered its share of
sacks: The Mongols raped and pillaged in 1258, Tamerlane's
followers repeated in 1400 and the Persians took their turn in
1524.
   Like those attacks, the sack of Bagdad, Mexico, failed to crush
the town. It took a hurricane in 1880 and changing trade patterns
to do that.
   There isn't much on either side of the river today: a
wind-blasted vista of shoe-high scrub; dry lakes, damp lakes and
marshes; a few fishermen's shacks and a few stands of trees, each
visible for miles.
   The only U.S. forces in evidence are the Border Patrolmen, who
run an occasional launch up the river, according to Ismael Perez, a
fisherman who has lived in what was Bagdad for 12 years.
   Perez, who had wandered over with Silberio Duenas to help a
stranger push his car out of a small bog, said he sometimes found
old bottles or coins, a few old building stones in the area.
   But no monuments, not even any eroded walls, bear witness to the
not-quite-splendor that was Bagdad.
   Why the place was named for the great Arab capital ``is a
mystery nobody has been able to solve,'' said Matamoros historian
Andres Cuellar. ``It's extremely odd.''
   He said one theory is that one of Bagdad's founders was inspired
by ``Thousand and One Nights,'' which tells the story of an Arab
sailor named Sindbad who sets out on adventures from Baghdad.
   Even in its heyday, Bagdad lacked the golden domes and tiled
spires of the Iraqi capital's mosques, the twisting alley ways of
mud brick houses, the brutal Ottoman intrigue of its politics. To
say nothing of any Arabs.
   But both are deadly flat, save for a few sand dunes in the
Mexican town. And both are graced by a river, although the Rio
Grande resembles the puny Jordan River more than Baghdad's mighty
Tigris.
   Cuellar said Bagdad was born when the authorities sought to stop
goods from disappearing between the ships offshore and the customs
house in Matamoros, 20 miles inland. They decided to put the tax
collector where the imports met the shore.
   Today, some people in Matamoros go blank when asked about the
city that once rivaled their own as a center of northern trade.
   ``Some people say there was a Bagdad, but it's now under the
waters of the sea,'' said a soda pop vender in downtown Matamoros,
when asked for directions to the site.
   For Perez and his fellow fishermen here, the conflict in the
Persian Gulf seems just as remote.
   Asked about the other Baghdad, he at first speculated on a city
in Texas.
   ``We don't have a radio here,'' he said. ``There is nothing here
but air.''

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley today dashed any
hopes for a proposed change in House rules that would have
bolstered the Democratic majority in 1992.
   The House Democratic caucus had been scheduled to vote on a
proposed rule change that would let lawmakers accept unlimited
donations to cover legal costs they may incur in the upcoming
redistricting.
   But Foley, D-Wash., emerged from the meeting to tell reporters,
``It will not happen. We're going to review the situation.''
   Boundaries of congressional districts will be changed nationwide
as a result of the 1990 census. Because the changes could
critically affect many 1992 House races, key redistricting plans
could wind up being settled in the courts.
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, who heads a Democratic group that is
reviewing House rules and making suggestions for changes, said
before today's vote: ``The likelihood is high that a number of
members would want legal advice.''
   Foley, in quashing the idea, provided no other details on the
issue, which when first disclosed on Monday attracted criticism.
   Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, said his citizens
group was urging House Democrats to reject the proposal, which he
said runs counter to public demand for tighter ethics rules.
   ``It's as if no one there is paying any attention to the Keating
Five hearings going on across the street in the other chamber,''
said Wertheimer, referring to the Senate ethics hearings on
allegations of influence-peddling in the savings and loan scandal.
   The proposed rule change would create an ``outrageous loophole''
at ``a time when the House should be taking steps to eliminate the
ability of outside interest groups to provide money to elected
officials who decide their interests,'' Wertheimer said.
   Normally, House rules limit gifts to members to $200. Under
Frost's proposal, that rule would be waived for any donations for
legal costs associated with redistricting. In addition, federal
election law limits on campaign donations would not apply.
   Lawmakers would have to report contributions and spending from
their special redistricting accounts. The reporting would be done
as part of Congress' annual financial disclosure process, which
allows a lag of up to 1{ years before a transaction must be
reported.
   Another leadership proposal to help incumbents would change the
rules in the taxpayer-financed House Recording Studio, which
lawmakers use to make pre-recorded messages to their home
districts.
   Lawmakers now must pay studio costs from their office accounts.
The new proposal would let them accept private reimbursement for
those expenses, thus freeing more office account money for mass
mailings and other purposes.
   Decisions on the rules changes were coming a day after the
Democrats and Republicans re-elected their leadership teams from
the last Congress.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., told the
Democrats they faced ``the challenge of improving the reputation
and credibility of this institution.''
   Gephardt and Foley were chosen without opposition by the
Democrats to continue in their posts, as were Majority Whip William
H. Gray, D-Pa., and caucus Chairman Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
   On the Republican side, Minority Leader Robert Michel of
Illinois and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia had no
opponents.
   But while the Democrats were pursuing advantage over the GOP,
the Republicans were fighting among themselves Monday.
   The No. 3-ranked Republican, conference Chairman Jerry Lewis of
California, had to survive a vigorous challenge by Rep. Carl
Pursell of Michigan. And Rep. Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan held on
to his chairmanship of the Republican Congressional Campaign
Committee in a tough battle with Rep. Don Sundquist of Tennessee.

   A brass band played, Santa Claus handed
out candy to tots and balloons filled the air today as two
Charleston-based ships returned from a six-month deployment in the
Persian Gulf.
   The guided missile frigates USS Taylor and Robert G. Bradley
were in the gulf when Iraq invaded Kuwait last Aug. 2.
   Since then, the vessels were involved in intercepting more than
500 ships and boats in the gulf. Boats were stopped or questioned
to enforce the United Nations blockade against Iraq.
   In August, the Bradley fired across the bow of an Iraqi tanker.
The Taylor did not discharge its guns during its six-month tour,
said Cmdr. Kevin Green of Summerville, S.C.
   ``We went over there without any expectation this type of thing
would happen,'' Green said. ``We were prepared for it, of course.''
   ``All of us have the feeling that when the show is going down
you want to be a part of it. But when the show was going down in
August, we were a part of it. For four months in the gulf we were
very busy,'' he said.
   The Taylor docked at the Charleston Navy Base this morning and
the Bradley returned about 30 minutes later. Cmdr. Kevin Cosgriff
would not allow reporters to go aboard the Bradley.
   Pierside, clowns and Santa Claus handed out candy. Some children
held pennants with the names of the ship.
   A number of women in the crowd also wore pink buttons that read:
``May I have my nervous breakdown now?''
   Sailor Tom Moody hugged his wife, Pam, who held their
5{-month-old son Christopher - a son he had never seen. The couple
also has a 3-year-old daughter.
   ``It was really hard,'' Mrs. Moody said. ``He was so far away.
But it's times like this that make it all worthwhile.''

<TEXT>
   Iran has executed more than 5,000 people in the
past three years, many for political beliefs, and the government
has done little to stem human rights abuses, Amnesty International
said today.
   Despite some changes since the 1989 death of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, government critics continued to be arrested and tortured,
some for no more than signing a letter criticizing lack of human
rights and freedoms, the international human rights group said in a
report.
   Amnesty quoted ex-prisoners as saying a ``death commission'' of
Iranian officials chose prisoners every day and sent them to their
deaths after a cursory interrogation if their views were not
acceptable.
   In 1988, more than 2,500 political prisoners were killed
secretly in a few months on orders of the commission, the
London-based organization said.
   Thousands more have been executed after summary trials in which
they were convicted of criminal offenses, Amnesty said. Crackdowns
on drug trafficking led to more than 1,100 executions in 1989, it
said.
   Most criminal executions are by hanging, but some people are
beheaded, forced to jump from high places or stoned to death while
buried to the waist, Amnesty said.
   A photo in the report shows the bodies of nine men hanging from
a crane on the back of a truck.
   The report says that after executions these portable gibbets may
be driven through the streets with the bodies still hanging from
them.
   The United Nations is considering a draft resolution condemning
rights violations in Iran based on findings of its Salvadoran
envoy, Reynaldo Galindo Pohl. He noted abuses of due process and a
startling number of executions.
   Iran on Monday persuaded the U.N. General Assembly to delete all
references in the resolution to ``executions, ill-treatment and
torture.'' In return, it pledged to continue cooperating with U.N.
human rights investigations and to begin letting the Red Cross
visit its prisons.
   A vote on the original draft resolution would have been a
humiliating public rebuke for Iran, which undoubtedly would have
refused to allow future visits by human rights experts.
   Tehran radio on Monday accused the United Nations of using the
original draft resolution to try to pressure Iran into dropping its
opposition to U.S.-led forces arrayed against Iraq in the Persian
Gulf region.
   ``The actions of Amnesty International and the human rights
commission of the United Nations tell of a vast, calculated
political pressure, whose roots should be searched outside the
framework of human rights,'' the radio said.
   Amnesty said the Iranian government has consistently refused to
answer the group's questions and ignored its requests to send a
delegation.
   Despite changes brought by the 1988 end of Iran's war with Iraq
and the death of Khomeini, ``The government has done little to
improve human rights protection,'' the report says.
   Amnesty, which opposes the death penalty, said people are often
executed days after their arrest with no legal counsel, no right to
call witnesses and no right to appeal.
   ``Torture, beating and intimidation of prisoners is reportedly
widespread,'' the organization said.
   More than 20 prominent government critics, including several
ex-ministers, were arrested in June after they supported an open
letter to President Hashemi Rafsanjani criticizing lack of freedoms
and human rights, Amnesty said.
   The group expressed fears the imprisoned critics were being
tortured to extract confessions of involvement in so-called
counterrevolutionary activity.
   Executions for criminal offenses are usually announced in the
Iranian press, but political executions are usually carried out in
secret, the report says: ``For this reason the numbers of political
executions which have taken place in Iran are disputed.''
   But Amnesty has recorded the names of over 2,000 prisoners
reportedly executed in secret from July 1988 to January 1989.
   ``There is overwhelming evidence that in the latter part of 1988
the Iranian government carried out the largest wave of political
executions in Iran since the early 1980s,'' it said.
   After the Iranian revolution of 1979, which ousted Shah Reza
Pahlavi and brought Khomeini to power, thousands of political
opponents were executed.
   Amnesty said former prisoners suggested the 1988-89 executions
might have resulted from two factors:
   -The cease-fire in the war with Iraq, which distracted
international attention from the prisoners.
   -Government reprisal for an armed incursion by an Iraq-based
Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, opposition group.

   A physician who hooked a woman to a
machine that let her take her life with the press of a button was
charged with murder by a prosecutor who said the switch did not
relieve the doctor of responsibility.
   Dr. Jack Kevorkian, known as ``Dr. Death'' for his invention,
helped a 54-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease use the machine
to inject herself with a fatal dose of an anesthetic and a
heart-stopping drug on June 4.
   ``Dr. Kevorkian was the primary and legal cause of Janet Adkins'
death. He cannot avoid his criminal culpability by the clever use
of a switch,'' Oakland County Prosecutor Richard Thompson said
Monday.
   Kevorkian, a 62-year-old retired pathologist from Royal Oak,
faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole if
convicted.
   ``I don't take this seriously,'' said Kevorkian, who has
advocated doctor-assisted suicide. ``What happens to me is
immaterial. The time has come for this thing.''
   The charges came one day before a hearing today to determine
whether Kevorkian's confiscated machine should be returned to him.
   Kevorkian's attorney, Geoffrey Fieger today told Judge Alice L.
Gilbert the state has no right to keep the suicide device because
Michigan has no specific law against assisted suicide.
   The lawyers then met privately in Gilbert's chambers. When the
hearing resumed, prosecutors attempted to put Kevorkian on the
stand. The doctor's attorneys said he wouldn't testify, and the
judge adjourned the hearing until Monday.
   Mrs. Adkins and her husband traveled from Portland, Ore., to
Michigan to meet Kevorkian because the state is one of the few that
do not explicitly make it a crime to help someone commit suicide.
She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, which robs people of their
memories, ability to function and eventually their lives.
   An autopsy confirmed Mrs. Adkins had Alzheimer's disease, but
she was not in the terminal stages of illness and was not in any
pain, Thompson said.
   ``For me not to charge Dr. Kevorkian would turn Oakland County
into the suicide mecca of our nation,'' he said.
   The prosecutor said he based the first-degree murder charge on a
1920 Michigan Supreme Court decision. In that case, a man who mixed
poison and placed it near his wife at her request was found guilty
of murder.
   The Legislature is considering a bill that would it a crime
punishable by up to four years in prison and a $2,000 fine to help
someone commit suicide.
   Fieger said because Michigan has no law against medically
assisted suicide, he didn't expect the case to come to trial.
   ``This is not a crime recognized in the state of Michigan,'' he
said.
   Kevorkian was arraigned and freed on $150,000 bail. A
preliminary hearing was set for Dec. 12.
   Ronald Adkins, Mrs. Adkins' husband, said he had no immediate
comment on the charges. The couple had belonged to the Hemlock
Society, a Eugene, Ore., organization that promotes death on demand
for the terminally ill.
   Derek Humphry, executive director of the society, ``This will be
quite a job getting a conviction, because the law in Michigan is
extremely ambiguous.''

   President Bush said today he doubts
that Iraq's Saddam Hussein has ``gotten the message'' of a United
Nations resolution authorizing force unless he gets out of Kuwait
by mid-January.
   During a joint news conference appearance here with Uruguayan
President Luis Alberto Lacalle, Bush reiterated that he would not
allow talks with the Iraqi leader and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
to get into the Palestinian issue and Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Bush also said that ``I don't agree with'' former top-ranking
U.S. military commanders who testified at congressional hearings
that economic sanctions against Iraq should be given considerably
more time to work.
   ``I've not been one whose been convinced that sanctions alone
will bring him to his senses,'' Bush said, although he said
``they're having some effect.''
   Of Saddam, the president said: ``I am convinced that up until
now, at least, he has not gotten the message. And the United
Nations resolution speaks for itself.''
   ``To me it was loud and clear,'' he said, ``but i don't think
Saddam Hussein yet understands that. And so the best hope for peace
is for him to understand that all means necessary to fulfill these
resolutions will be used against him. And I hope he understands
that.''
   Bush announced last week that he was sending Secretary of State
James A. Baker III to Baghdad to meet with Saddam, sometime late
this month or in early January, and that he would receive Aziz for
talks at the White House.
   But the president said these meetings would not constitute
negotiations with Iraq's leaders, but would merely represent Bush's
last-ditch political effort to get Saddam to withdraw Iraqi forces
from Kuwait.
   ``I'm not in a negotiating mood or anything of that nature,'' he
said today.
   In Washington, Senate Democrats have repeatedly urged Bush to
stick with the economic embargo.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., made the point repeatedly during five days
of hearings that he engineered as chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee. Day after day, former U.S. defense officials
urged the White House to give the sanctions more time - bolstering
the Democratic challenge to Bush's strategy.
   When two current officials - Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and
Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff - finally
testified on Monday, Nunn asked them if the administration was
dismissing sanctions too easily.
   ``If we go to war, we never will know whether they would have
worked,'' said Nunn, who has criticized the president's decision to
increase the number of U.S. troops in the region to more than
440,000.
   Cheney and Powell struck a pessimistic tone, saying that Saddam
could ride out the international sanctions imposed after his forces
invaded the oil-rich emirate of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   They also used their appearances before the panel to try to stem
the tide of congressional discontent over Bush's conduct.
   ``Given the nature of the regime, given Saddam Hussein's
brutality to his own people, his very tight control of that
society, his ability to allocate resources for the military, their
ability to produce their own food ... he can ride them out,''
Cheney said.
   He described the administration position that American and
international interests are in jeopardy in the crisis, especially
if Saddam gains a stranglehold on oil supplies.
   The defense secretary also said he does not believe Bush
requires any additional authority from Congress before ``committing
U.S. forces to achieve our objectives in the (Persian) Gulf.''
   In a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Monday, nine out of
10 people approved of Bush's offer to send Baker to Baghdad for
talks with Saddam.
   While 90 percent of the 758 adults selected at random for the
poll said they supported the decision to send Baker to Baghdad, 53
percent said they didn't think it would do any good.
   The poll, conducted by telephone last Friday and Saturday, also
found that 69 percent approved of the U.N. resolution authorizing
the use of military force. The poll has a likely margin of
uncertainity of 4 percent either way.

   Imelda Marcos' lawyers got a look
Tuesday at their client's possessions, including the lavish
collection of shoes she left behind when her husband was ousted in
a popular uprising four years ago.
   ``I was impressed by what I saw,'' lawyer Drew Neville told
reporters after touring Malacanang Palace, where Mrs. Marcos' late
husband, Ferdinand, ruled for 20 years.
   ``Extravagance is your word,'' he added. ``I said I was
impressed by what I saw.''
   Neville and colleague Conner Helms arrived Sunday for talks in a
multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Mrs. Marcos. A hearing is
scheduled next Monday in federal court in Los Angeles.
   The tour included a look at more than 1,000 pairs of shoes Mrs.
Marcos collected during her husband's years in power. The shoes are
a major attraction of the palace, which was opened to public tours
after the February 1986 revolution that toppled Marcos.
   Asked what he thought of the shoes, Neville replied: ``They are
a little small for me but they appeared to be OK.''
   Marcos died in exile in Hawaii in September 1989.

   Anwer Siddiqui hates to miss a flight, but
this time he was grateful.
   Siddiqui, 29, of Atlanta, had been scheduled to take Northwest
Flight 1482 from Detroit to Pittsburgh on Monday, but his
connecting flight from Atlanta got a late start and delayed landing
in Detroit because of fog.
   ``Had we landed then, I would have been on that flight and
probably dead,'' Siddiqui said.
   Eight people aboard Flight 1482 were killed and at least 20
people were treated for burns, broken bones, smoke inhalation and
other injuries after the DC-9 collided with a Boeing 727 on the
runway at Detroit Metropolitan Airport.
   Siddiqui and several others who had been scheduled to take the
flight instead ended up on Flight 1484, a later flight, for various
reasons. They expressed relief Monday night when their plane landed
at Greater Pittsburgh International Airport.
   Owen Ballow, 30, of Detroit, was traveling to Pittsburgh on
business for Schneider U.S.A. Inc. of Minneapolis, a medical
products company. He said he ``owes one'' to his company's travel
agent for dissuading him from his plan to board Flight 1482.
   The agent talked Ballow out of taking the earlier flight because
bad weather had delayed flights out of Detroit and the terminal was
crowded. He ended up taking the same flight as Siddiqui.
   ``Whey you fly, if your number is up, you lose,'' Ballow said.
``Fortunately, it doesn't happen often. But when you fly
frequently, it makes you think.''
   Also on Flight 1484 was Mobay Corp. executive Michael Short of
the Pittsburgh suburb of Mount Lebanon. He said he had tickets to
fly on the burned plane but rescheduled his flight because of a
lunch appointment.
   ``I'm feeling pretty lucky,'' he said. ``I had a few drinks on
the plane on the way home.''

<TEXT>
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad bowed
to an increasingly violent campaign for his ouster and agreed today
to quit as soon as the opposition nominates a replacement, state
radio said.
   Parliament will meet Saturday to try to choose a successor, the
radio said in a late-night news bulletin.
   Ershad had offered Monday to step down shortly before elections
scheduled for June, but the opposition, which had staged a
seven-week campaign to drive him from office, rebuffed that offer
and demanded that he step down now.
   The 60-year-old former army general took over Bangladesh, one of
the world's poorest countries, in a bloodless coup in 1982.
   Ershad had declared a state of emergency Nov. 27 to quash the
opposition campaign seeking his ouster.
   Immediately after the announcement, hundreds of opposition
workers thronged the streets of the capital, chanting slogans and
setting off firecrackers.
   ``Where is Ershad now?'' they shouted.
   Pressure on Ershad had been building steadily. At least 19 of
his supporters resigned from Parliament, the opposition called for
daily dawn-to-dusk strikes, and scores of civil servants quit their
jobs.
   As part of the anti-Ershad program, the country's two largest
cities were paralyzed today by a general strike.
   Word of the president's latest offer came after the opposition
announced new protests to intensify its campaign to oust him.
   In the capital, Dhaka, few buses or rickshaws were on the
streets today and shops were closed. Banks and most businesses were
closed. Government offices opened, but few arrived for work.
   In a nationally televised speech Monday night, Ershad offered to
resign 45 days before presidential elections set for June, handing
over power to a nominee of the opposition.
   Ershad had said in addition to stepping down before June
elections, he was willing to dissolve Parliament and hold
parliamentary elections simultaneously with the presidential vote,
with international observers as witnesses.
   But opposition leaders made no move to rescind their call for
daily, eight-hour strikes.
   ``His offer is vague and we don't accept his proposal to hold
presidential and parliamentary elections,'' Sheik Hasina, leader of
the Awami League, the second major opposition group, had sad after
the first announcement.
   Groups of 100 to 200 demonstrators marched through Dhaka's
central Mouchak commercial district earlier today shouting, ``The
last days of Ershad have arrived!'' and ``Give Ershad one more push
and he will fall!''
   On Monday, the government lifted press censorship. But
journalists decided to continue their strike until the state of
emergency is lifted.
   Ershad also said on Monday he would lift the emergency on Dec.
16, the 19th anniversary of Bangladesh's independence from
Pakistan.
   His coup in 1982 followed a chaotic succession of presidents
installed by the military after the former province of Pakistan won
its independence in the 1971 civil war. Bangladesh, with 110
million people, is among the poorest and most densely populated
countries in the world.

   The passengers on one plane felt only a
slight bump, like a blown tire, while a few yards away the jetliner
that had collided with theirs was already engulfed by a fireball
that would kill eight people.
   ``That's when it really hit me, when I saw the other plane at
the end of the runway,'' said Robert Karp, 60, of Jackson, Miss.
``I thought `My God, how close were we to a broadside collision?'
''
   Karp was one of 153 people aboard a Northwest Airlines Boeing
727 roaring down a runway toward takeoff Monday when it collided
with a Northwest DC-9 carrying 43 people.
   The 727's right wing was sheared off, but the fuselage was
largely undamaged and the only injuries suffered were to passengers
evacuating.
   The DC-9 exploded in flames that engulfed its cabin and killed
eight people. Twenty others suffered burns, smoke inhalation,
broken bones or internal injuries as they scrambled out of the
plane.
   ``I saw a guy with a broken leg, another with a broken ankle and
a lot of body burns,'' said Loricel Mangulabnan, 27, of Birmingham.
   John Izzo, 41, of Pho cares? You're still alive.''

   Troops getting a rare break from
desert duty made Christmas messages on videotape Tuesday for loved
ones back home. One Marine donned a Santa cap. Another put on his
gas mask.
   And one homesick soldier mouthed a tender ``I love you'' for his
wife before getting up from his chair to kiss the camera lens.
   The taping takes place daily at a Marine Corps Rest and
Relaxation Center, better known as Desert World. Troops sit in
front of one of eight video cameras to make 15-minute messages
called Better Than A Letter.
   Chief Warrant Officer Randall Anderson, 33, of Swainsboro, Ga.,
put on a pair of Santa Claus suspenders and a red-and-white
stocking cap his wife sent him. The only other things he wore were
his Marine Corps gym shorts and shower shoes.
   ``It was the perfect time to lay down a Merry Christmas message
that I'm doing fine and that I'll be home some day,'' said
Anderson, who blew a kiss to his wife and daughter. He serves with
the Headquarters and Support Company of the 1st Battalion, 7th
Marine Regiment.
   Lance Cpl. Will French, 24, of Johnstown, Pa., showed the folks
back home how he puts on his gas mask during alerts.
   ``I just wanted to show them things were all right and I'm
safe,'' said French, who serves with a Marine tank unit.
   A number of the messages began with ``Hi, Mom.''
   One said longingly, ``Don't forget me.''
   Another said reassuringly, ``I'll be home as soon as I can.''
   One Marine did a segment of his message in sign language for a
deaf relative.
   More than a few Marines spilled their souls in their 15-minute
segments. These video messages are a technological leap over the
audio cassettes of Vietnam and the crumpled letters of Korea and
wars past.
   Since the video service began operating Nov. 11, more than 8,100
people have recorded messages on cameras donated by Montgomery
Ward. They are sent home by the USO.
   It's just one of the amenities offered by Desert World, which
was originally built by the Saudi Royal Commission for oilfield
workers. It was unused for six years before being turned over to
the Marines.
   About 1,200 servicemen and women a day come to swim in an
Olympic-sized pool, play volleyball or baketball, pump iron in
weight rooms donated by Arnold Schwarzenegger, toss a Frisbee,
catch a movie, play video games, use one of 21 phones to call home,
read books or browse in a store.
   After checking their weapons with a guard, they trade their
battle dress uniforms for gym clothes and their combat boots for
sneakers.
   Some just stretch out in the shade or sun themselves on an
irrigated lawn adorned with date palm trees and shrubs. The grass
is enough to make an impression.
   ``The green almost hurts my eyes,'' said Cpl. Michael Flaga, 25,
of McHenry, Ill., who serves with the 3rd Battalion, 9th Marine
Regiment. ``We're used to seeing no colors in the desert. I
couldn't believe they had something like this.''
   ``It's as close as you're going to come to a piece of America,''
said Lance Cpl. Anthony Uhler, 20, of Pontiac, Mich. He came to
tape a message to his wife, who is expecting their first child in
January.
   ``After being out there in the endless sand, it's good to see
grass,'' said Lance Cpl. Michael Buell, 21, of Sioux City, Iowa.
   Desert City is run by the Marines, but U.S. Navy nurses, British
troops from the 7th Armored Brigade and some members of the U.S.
Army 82nd Airborne Division use the facilities.
   ``The Marines and Navy know how to live. We're wasting our money
on parachutes and bullets,'' said Lt. Richard Ballard, 29, of the
82nd Airborne Division out of Fort Bragg, N.C.
   He had only been able to call home twice since he arrived in
August.
   ``This is the first day I had off in 119 days. This is the first
time I've seen anything that resembles grass,'' said Staff Sgt.
Craig Colberg, 29, of Aurora, Ohio, also of the 82nd Airborne.
   Since Desert World opened Nov. 4, it has entertained 29,292
service members. A total of 19,378 have watched movies and 15,055
have called home, said Master Gunnery Sgt. John Kulick of
Pawtucket, R.I.
   ``It's got the atmosphere of home. It's one of the biggest
morale boosts I've seen,'' Kulick said. ``We get long faces in the
morning and smiles at the end of the day.''

   Public health officials are making it easier,
faster and cheaper for millions of women who suffer from vaginal
yeast infections to get treatment.
   With the availability soon of the first over-the-counter drug to
treat these infections, women will be able to skip the doctor's
office and go straight to the pharmacy - and pay less than when it
was a prescription drug.
   ``We're delighted,'' said Cindy Pearson, program director of the
Women's Health Network, who testified in favor of the switch before
an FDA advisory committee. The committee recommended the action the
FDA took Monday.
   ``We've had nothing but positive and enthusiastic support from
our members'' for the FDA action, Ms. Pearson said. ``Some want to
give it (the drug) to their friends for Christmas.''
   Vaginal yeast infections afflict nearly three-fourths of all
women at least once in their lifetimes. About 22 million cases are
reported annually.
   The drug that was approved for over-the-counter use is
clotrimazole, which is sold under the trade name Gyne-Lotrimin by
its maker, Schering Plough HealthCare Products. It will be sold
over the counter at full prescription strength.
   The company plans to begin shipping its nonprescription product
on Jan. 2 and expects to have it on store shelves nationwide by the
beginning of February, said Kristie Egstrand, product manager for
Gyne-Lotrimin. Pharmacists cannot distribute their prescription
supplies of the drug for over-the-counter sales because they would
not be labeled properly, she said.
   Dr. Carl Peck, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research, said the drug has been used safely for more than a
decade, is highly effective and has little risk.
   Gyne-Lotrimin costs about $25 for a seven-day course of
treatment when it is prescribed. The over-the-counter price will be
in the range of $17 to $18, said company spokesman Doug Petkus.
   Ortho Pharmaceuticals also is seeking FDA approval to allow its
anti-fungal product Monistat to be sold without prescription, said
Robert Kniffin, a spokesman for Ortho's parent corporation, Johnson
&amp; Johnson.
   Monistat is the leading prescription treatment for vaginal yeast
infections with 59 percent of the market, he said, and another
Ortho product, Terazol, is second in the market. Schering Plough
officials said Gyne-Lotrimin is third.
   Dr. Raquel Arias, a Los Angeles gynecologist who spoke at the
company's news conference in New York on Monday, said the FDA's
decision - which takes effect immediately - will allow women to
spend their health care dollars more effectively.
   ``This is one of the most common things you see in practice,''
she said. ``It can be a significant disruptor of a woman's
lifestyle. Now they'll be able just to go to the store and get an
effective treatment.''
   Labeling on Gyne-Lotrimin will advise women experiencing vaginal
itch and discomfort for the first time to see a physician for an
accurate diagnosis.
   But women who have had a yeast infection diagnosed by a health
practitioner before know the symptoms: itching and burning,
sometimes with a discharge and soreness. These women can safely
treat themselves, the FDA said.
   Vaginal yeast infection, or candidiasis, is an overgrowth of a
naturally occurring fungus called Candida. The overabundance occurs
when the body's natural balance of bacteria is upset. This often
occurs with antibiotics or birth control pills. Diabetics also are
subject to greater risk of recurring infections, and warm weather
can be a factor as well.
   The symptoms, though, can be similar to those of other
conditions, including sexually transmitted diseases, which is why a
woman should get an initial diagnosis by a physician, the FDA said.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Noriega Transcripts Public - But Not Yet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled today that court transcripts
of tapes acquired by CNN containing prison conversations of Manuel
Noriega should be made public, but he didn't release them
immediately.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler issued the decision after
four media organizations asked for access to the court documents
last week, saying the public had a right to know the factual basis
of a case that tested the constitutional limits of prior restraint.
   The judge said he would not release the transcripts until
Thursday to allow CNN time to appeal to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Atlanta.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said he did not immediately know
whether the network would appeal.
   Bienstock argued earlier that releasing the transcripts would be
an ``intrusion into the news-gathering and news-editing process.''
.
   In his 18-page decision, Hoeveler chided CNN for first fighting
to televise the tapes and then seeking to keep the transcripts from
being used by other news organizations.
   The judge said it ``comes as somewhat of a surprise to have CNN,
the forceful proponent of a free press operating without judicial
intervention, return to this court urging that the press and public
be denied a right of access to the very information which CNN has
argued is of immediate public interest.''
   Hoeveler dismissed CNN's contention that it owned the content of
the tapes, saying it was the U.S. government that monitored
Noriega's prison conversations and recorded them, not CNN.
   Karen Kammer, an attorney representing the four media
organizations said she was pleased with the ruling. The
organizations are The Miami Herald, The Associated Press,
Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of Miami and Gannett Co. Inc. and USA
Today, which Gannett owns.
   ``I think the court has recognized that the content of the tapes
does not belong to CNN, as we had argued,'' she said.
   Three weeks ago, CNN revealed it had obtained seven tapes of
phone calls made from Noriega's prison cell near here. Federal
prison officials say they routinely tape phone conversations of
inmates unless the prisoner is calling his lawyers, and that all
inmates are made aware of this practice.
   The fallen Panamanian dictator's attorneys went into court Nov.
8 after learning about the tapes and Hoeveler ordered CNN not to
play any that might interfere with attorney-client privilege. The
network played some portions of the tapes for a day, but withdrew
them when a federal appeals court backed Hoeveler.
   The Supreme Court refused to intervene on a 7-2 vote, forcing
CNN to submit the tapes to the judge for review. Transcripts then
were prepared by court officials in Miami to aid Hoeveler and
attorneys in the case in reviewing the contents of the tapes.
   Last week, Hoeveler decided to allow CNN to broadcast the tapes
and returned them to the network, but they were not immediately
aired.
   CNN has not said where it got the tapes, but Noriega's attorneys
said the tapes were released to the government of Panama by the
State Department or the Drug Enforcement Administration and that
Panama gave them to CNN.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.

<DATELINE>HERNDON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steve Malarkey was a disgruntled computer
technician looking for a career change when his cat leaped forward
with an idea.
   ``I was sitting in front of the TV with my wife, watching a
National Geographic special on birds of the Cayman Islands or
somewhere,'' he said.
   ``Our cat Stick, who never even glanced at TV before, came out
of his box like a shot and sat right in front of the screen,
growling and meowing.''
   Malarkey borrowed a friend's video camera and tripod, scattered
birdseed and popcorn in his wooded backyard and recorded the antics
of neighborhood birds, squirrels and chipmunks that gathered for a
noisy feast.
   ``When I brought the tape back to the house and showed it to
Stick, he went ballistic,'' Malarkey said. ``He was in front of the
TV, behind the TV, on top of the TV, knocking things over and
swiping at the screen.''
   Nice kitty.
   Malarkey went into the ``cat business'' in a big way. His
``Video Catnip,'' a professional, 25-minute version of the same
backyard scene, is one of the hottest gift items to appear on pet
store shelves this Christmas season.
   Malarkey says he's sold 7,000 copies since his video hit the
market in September 1989, most of them in the past couple of
months. Fewer than 10 tapes have been returned on behalf of
dissatisfied feline viewers, he said.
   Human viewers might find ``Video Catnip'' boring after a while.
There's just so much excitement in watching a pair of blue jays
squabbling or a squirrel snitching a peanut from a bowl.
   But Malarkey, who recently moved from this Washington suburb to
Morgantown, W.Va., says it's the purr-fect stocking stuffer for the
indoor cat who has everything.
   ``Steven Spielberg it ain't,'' he said, ``but we haven't gotten
any complaints yet from the cats.''
   The tape, which retails for $19.95, promises ``some
cat-a-clysmic fun with no paws in the action.'' It starts with this
warning:
   ``While watching this video, your cat may become excited and
attempt to get inside your television set to get at the birds. ...
We strongly suggest that you remove all breakables from on top or
around your TV set. No kitting.''
   The live action is divided into segments titled ``Cheep
Thrills,'' ``Mews and Feather Report'' and ``A Stalk in the Park,''
which features plenty of close-up shots of kitty's favorite
creatures cavorting on the TV screen.
   Can cats really ``see'' a TV video?
   Veterinarians agree with Malarkey that although cats don't
discern shapes and colors as distinctly as humans, they are acutely
aware of moving figures and sounds that excite them.
   Malarkey says he's plowing the profits from ``Video Catnip''
into a series of sequels with ``bigger birds, bigger squirrels,
maybe some sea gulls thrown in.''

   An ambulance crew drove six hours on
snow-covered highways to pick up a liver for a transplant patient
after a storm prevented an airplane carrying the organ from
landing.
   The storm, which dumped up to 2 feet of snow in Wisconsin,
forced the plane to be diverted Monday from Milwaukee to Green Bay.
   Despite slippery roads and creeping traffic, the ambulance
delivered the liver, allowing the transplant operation to get under
way about seven hours later, said Pat Crowley, nursing supervisor
at Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee.
   The patient, identified only as a 42-year-old woman, was in
serious condition Tuesday after receiving the liver of a
24-year-old man who died Sunday in a car accident in Alabama.
   ``She's doing OK. She's doing as well as can be expected,'' said
hospital spokeswoman Nancy Pinkowski.
   The woman, who doctors believed would die in weeks without the
transplant, had been placed in the highest priority category on a
nationwide recipient list, said Jim King, a Froedtert spokesman.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Promises Crackdown on Black Market in Food</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with crackdown on black marketeering
planned, Gorbachev's prediction on food supplies for winter, more
on shake-up.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   MOSCOW - President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the Soviet
legislature today that he will crack down on black marketeering and
boost food imports to feed the population during this
shortage-plagued winter.
   He promised that his actions would guarantee the food supply to
the nation for the next three or four months.
   Gorbachev also said his upcoming shake-up of the Soviet Cabinet
would drastically shrink it. Aides said its membership would drop
from 56 ministers to little more than a dozen.
   The president presented draft constitutional amendments for
revamping of the Soviet government and won immediate approval of
them by a vote of 281-17.
   The larger Congress of People's Deputies, which convenes Dec.
17, also must ratify the amendments.
   Describing the rampant black market in food in the Soviet Union,
Gorbachev said a survey of 50 state stores found that ``when they
close, they have a third shift,'' when employees sell the food
illegally.
   Salesclerks in Soviet stores often set aside choice goods to
sell at inflated prices so they can pocket the profits.
   ``Within the next two or three weeks, we think we can control
the situation,'' he said, referring to the black market.
   Gorbachev also said he had obtained loans and credits to import
flour, sugar, vegetable oil, margarine, meat, milk products and
eggs.
   During the first three months of 1991, he said the Soviet
government would spend the equivalent of 2.1 billion rubles on
food, including:
   10 miliion tons of grain, 1.9 million tons of sugar, 156,000
tons of flour, 277,000 tons of sunflower oil, 357,000 tons of meat
and meat products, 4.5 million tons of milk products, and 110,000
tons of groats.
   The government also is stepping up its construction program for
food processing, and will set aside 12 million acres for
``individual farming'' to boost domestic production, he said.
   Gorbachev did not specify what types of food processing
industries would be built or whether the additional land for
individual farming would actually be owned by private farmers or
collective farms.
   On Monday, the parliament of the Russian Federation approved a
measure allowing private land ownership, but the national
legislature has not taken that step so far.
   The United States, Germany and Italy have begun sending food aid
to the Soviet Union and other western and Asian countries have
pledged their support. Soviet officials blame problems with food
distribution for increasingly empty grocery store shelves.
   Gorbachev's overhaul of his administrative structure would
shrink the Council of Ministers and rename it the Cabinet of
Ministers.
   Presidential spokesman Vitaly Ignatienko later said the new
Cabinet would have 12 to 15 members. Asked when the appointments
would be made to the new body, he said: ``Soon. In our lifetime.''
   The Cabinet of Ministers would be responsible to the president,
and control the national budget, energy industries, transportation,
environmental protection as well as credit and foreign currency.
   In conjunction with the republics, it would work out a national
program for health insurance, maternity and child care issues,
culture and education and basic scientific research.
   The Cabinet would continue to include the prime ministers of the
15 republics in addition to the federal officials, the Interfax
news agency reported.
   The Federation Council, an advisory board representing the 15
republics, would be enhanced, and take responsibility for carrying
out the decisions that it approves.
   This could ease Gorbachev's authority problems by enlisting the
republic presidents' aid in carrying out Kremlin decisions.
Recently, many republics have rejected orders from the central
government.
   The reform also calls for creating a vice presidency and a
National Security Council. It would abolish his Presidential
Council - itself only a few months old.
   The National Security Council would maintain national defense,
``maintenance of a reliable state,'' economic and ecological
security, and handle natural disasters and emergencies, Interfax
reported.
   The 15 Soviet republics would not have national security
responsibilities.
   The constitutional changes would preserve the post of prime
minister, to be nominated by the president and approved by the
Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Many lawmakers said they were disappointment with Gorbachev's
speech.
   ``A lot of questions remain,'' said Fyodor Burlatsky. ``The
president explained some general ideas, but we don't know the real
functions for the new institutions,'' Burlatsky said.

<HEAD>Ex-Minister Charged with War Crimes Decries Justice System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ex-Cabinet minister charged nearly eight years
ago with crimes against humanity during the Nazi occupation told a
court Tuesday that his reputation had been tarnished by the
slow-moving judicial process.
   Maurice Papon, 80, spoke at the opening of a defamation
proceeding he initiated against a news magazine, saying it was his
only way to seek justice.
   He was charged in January 1983 with crimes he allegedly
committed between 1942-44 as a senior police official in the
Bordeaux region. The alleged offenses include the deportation of
1,960 Jews to death camps.
   The 1983 charges against Papon are still pending. He has not
been brought to trial, in part because some potential evidence was
thrown out on a technicality in 1987.
   Papon has accused the leftist Le Nouvel Observateur and two
reporters of defamation and improperly divulging court documents in
an article published in June that referred to him as a ``French
accomplice of genocide.''
   ``It is intolerable that a state of law lets things drag on in
this way,'' he said in a 25-minute statement opening the trial.
``Enough is enough.''
   Papon, budget minister under former President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, wants $200,000 in damages.
   Papon's decision to take the legal initiative coincides with
assertions by lawyers and human rights activists that his case and
two others have been stalled or dragged out because of reluctance
in ``the highest levels of government'' to expose French complicity
in the Holocaust during World War II.
   Yves Jouffa, president of the French League of Human Rights,
called the three men members of an ``establishment ... that does
not want to see its dirty laundry washed in public.''
   The others are Rene Bousquet, 81, who headed the national police
of the collaborationist Vichy government and later was Paris police
chief, and Paul Touvier, 75, a militia leader who worked closely
with Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie in Lyon. He was arrested in May
1989 at a priory in Nice.
   After the war, Papon had a successful career as a high-ranking
civil servant. In 1981 the satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine
disclosed his wartime activities. Legal proceedings began, and he
left public life.
   ``You can transplant onto me that I was the symbol of an
administration, a regime, a judicial system ... (that) make all of
France the co-author of a genocide,'' Papon told the court, saying
he was the object of a judicial machination.
   ``My dossier must remain open to put into the heads of all
Frenchmen that they all were collaborators, all accomplices to
genocide.''
   Claude Perdriel, director of Le Nouvel Observateur, said his
magazine was not trying to judge Papon, ``but we have a duty not to
make a practice of forgetfulness.''
   Journalists Serge Raffy and Marie-France Etchegoin described
their research as ``long and prudent.''
   The trial was to last two days.

   Prime Minister John Major's vision of a ``society
of opportunity'' faces an immediate tet from some Conservative
Party members who are rebelling against a black lawyer selected as
their candidate for Parliament.
   John Taylor, who hopes to be the first black Conservative in the
House of Commons, was selected last weekend by the Tory
organization in Cheltenham, near Gloucester in western England.
   Some Conservatives complained they were given no choice but
Taylor, and one inflamed the controversy when he was quoted in a
national newspaper as calling the candidate ``a bloody nigger.''
   William Galbraith, a Conservative Party member in Cheltenham,
confirmed Tuesday that he had made the remark in a private
conversation. ``I did not expect anything I said to friends to be
quoted in the national press,'' he said in an interview with BBC
radio.
   He added: ``I did say we would not let bloody niggers into this
town.''
   Major, who began his political climb in the racially mixed
London district of Brixton, took office a week ago with a promise
to work for a ``society of opportunity.''
   In his first major address to the Conservative Party
organization on Tuesday, Major supported Taylor.
   ``We believe that every man and woman should be able to go as
far as their talent, ambition and effort take them,'' Major said.
``There should be no artificial barrier of background, religion or
race.''
   Later, answering questions in the House of Commons, Major said
the reported remarks by Galbraith ``are not sentiments that have
any place in our party.''
   Taylor, writing in Tuesday's editions of the Daily Mail, said it
was good that the furor had erupted early in Major's tenure.
   ``It will show him precisely how big is the mountain that has to
be climbed before the meritocracy of which he dreams becomes a
reality,'' Taylor wrote.
   Taylor also won support from Conservative Party chairman Chris
Patten, appointed by Major last week; Patten's predecessor, Kenneth
Baker; and Norman Tebbit, a prominent Tory right-winger who in the
past has been an outspoken critic of immigration.
   ``He was selected on merit,'' Patten said. ``I do not think that
anybody has any time at all for the rather repellent views of a
minority in our society.''
   Galbraith said he was unhappy that Taylor was not a resident of
the almost totally white, heavily middle-class town - although it's
common in British politics for candidates to be outsiders.
   Despite the backing of the executive committee, Taylor was
selected as the local candidate in the next general election by a
vote of 111 to 83.
   ``This man has been bulldozed into the constituency by Head
Office, who are determined to have a black man in the Commons,''
said Colin Lear, a real estate agent in Cheltenham and a local
party member.
   There are only four blacks in the 650-seat House of Commons, all
members of the Labor Party.
   About 5 percent of Britain's population is classified as
``non-white,'' a broad label that includes West Indians,
Pakistanis, Indians, Chinese and persons of mixed race.
   Taylor, 38, has previously run as a Conservative candidate in
Solihull in central England. Typically, aspiring politicians have
to run one or more hopeless campaigns before being selected in a
district where they have a chance of winning.
   Taylor, the son of a West Indian cricket player, is a barrister
- a lawyer qualified to argue cases in court - and a member of the
local council in Solihull, where he was born.
   Monica Drinkwater, the Conservative chairwoman in Cheltenham,
said 250 people applied to be selected. She said the executive
committee of nearly 50 members whittled the group down to four by a
secret ballot, and then agreed on Taylor in a second ballot.
   She said Tuesday that the executiv committee would meet again
in the next 10 days, when it could consider expelling Galbraith.
   ``I think we should stand back and give this issue some long,
cool and calm thought,'' she said.

<HEAD>No Partial Solutions on Iraq, Says New British Leader</HEAD>

   Prime Minister John Major, echoing his predecessor
Margaret Thatcher's policies on the Persian Gulf, on Tuesday ruled
out negotiations with Iraq, or any ``partial solutions or linkages
to other issues.''
   Aides said Major planned to go to the gulf soon, probably early
next year, to confer with leaders in the area and visit British
troops. The 30,000 British troops in the region make up the
second-biggest Western force after the U.S. contingent.
   ``We fully support President Bush when he says that he is
prepared to travel the extra mile to achieve such a (peaceful)
solution,'' said Major, referring to the planned trip to Baghdad by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   ``So are we. But there can be no question of negotiations,
concessions, partial solutions or linkage to other issues,'' he
told a Conservative Party rally, the first he has addressed as
leader.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has repeatedly suggested that a
resolution to the Persian Gulf crisis should be linked to an
Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab lands. The United States has
said the Palestinian issue is unrelated.
   Britain was the prime backer of a U.S.-led initiative that
resulted in a U.N. Security Council resolution last week
authorizing the use of force if Iraq does not withdraw from Kuwait
by Jan. 15.
   In the House of Commons, Defense Secretary Tom King said Britain
had sent reinforcements to ensure that if war broke out it would be
``short and sharp and quick, and that casualties on the allied side
would be kept to a minimum.''
   Earlier, Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs
of Staff, conferred with King and held his first meeting with Major
at the start of a two-day visit here.
   Powell was invited before the gulf crisis began in August, by
the British chief of defense staff, Air Marshal Sir David Craig.
Powell was to address a London research body, the Royal United
Services Institute, on Wednesday.
   Britain decided last month to send another 14,000 troops to the
gulf, bringing its troop total to 30,000. Public opinion polls
continue to indicate most Britons back the deployment of troops and
generally support the government's hard-line policy.
   Major said the terms for peace remained the same: an
unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, restoration of the
Kuwaiti government and the release of all hostages.

   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos on Tuesday
expanded the administration's campaign for local jurisdictions to
give parents more freedom to decide which schools their children
attend.
   Cavazos launched an Education Department office called the
Center for Choice in Education, which he said will operate as
resource for information and assistance on the issue.
   ``President Bush and I have long been vigorous supporters of
school choice and other empowerment initiatives which allow
families a greater voice over their future,'' Cavazos told
reporters. ``We believe that choice is essential for the successful
reform of America's schools.''
   Cavazos said the movement is gaining momentum as states explored
a variety of ways to empower parents to select the school that best
suits their child. He noted that Minnesota, Arkansas, Iowa,
Nebraska and Ohio were among the first to enact laws allowing
parents to choose schools across district lines.
   Since last fall, Washington, Vermont, Utah, Idaho, Colorado and
Kentucky also have passed legislation permitting greater parental
choice, he said.
   Cavazos' action came a day after 10 national education groups
took a formal position against ``vouchers masquerading as choice.''
That was an indirect criticism of a Wisconsin plan which allows
disadvantaged children to attend private, non-religious schools in
Milwaukee at public expense. The funding provision of the plan has
been unlawful, for essentially technical reasons, by a state
appeals court.
   Singling out the Wisconsin program, Cavazos said ``President
Bush supports this program, and after visiting one of these schools
... I can attest personally to the hope and satisfaction such a
program can provide, particularly for low-income and minority
families.''
   On Monday, the Forum of Educational Organization Leaders urged
``the president and other government and community leaders at all
levels to join in opposing private school vouchers and supporting
the strengthening of our public schools.''
   Cavazos said the administration takes no position on public
support of private schools, and stressed that how choice programs
are financed ``really is a state or local decision.''
   ``At the present time I do not see the federal government moving
in the direction of providing vouchers or direct support for any of
these programs,'' Cavazos said. ``The president has made very, very
clear that we will not move in that direction.
   ``Budget constraints are just absolutely enormous at this time.
States must make a decision whether they want to include the
private school sector, including independent and church-related
schools,'' he said.
   Cavazos said that in addition to the center, the department will
set up a toll-free choice ``hotline'' to respond to requests for
reports and other information on the issue. The number is
1-800-442-PICK.

   Federal aviation officials have imposed safety
rules over the last six years in an effort to reduce the dangers of
aircraft fires such as the one that swept a Northwest Airlines DC-9
in Detroit.
   But those officials acknowledge that safety can't be guaranteed
in an aircraft propelled by highly flammable jet fuel.
   Monday's runway collision of the DC-9 and a Northwest 727 at
Detroit's Metropolitan Airport killed eight people aboard the DC-9.
The eight apparently died from inhaling noxious fumes before their
bodies were burned beyond recognition, officials said.
   At least 20 other people were hospitalized with burns, broken
bones and smoke inhalation.
   Concern over aircraft fires was dramatized in 1977 when two
Boeing 747 jumbo jets collided on a foggy runway at Tenerife in the
Canary Islands, killing 581 people.
   In 1984, the Federal Aviation Administration experimented with
an anti-misting fuel additive, hoping it would prevent jet fuel
vapors from igniting in a crash.
   The additive worked in stationary tests. However, when the FAA
deliberately crashed a remote-controlled Boeing 720 in the
California desert, the jetliner was engulfed in flames.
   Eleven months later, the FAA said ``the concept is not practical
for day-to-day airline operation in the foreseeable future.''
   The experiment was not repeated.
   But the FAA and the Department of Transportation have tried to
make aircraft cabins more flame resistant. The aim, the agency
said, is to prevent a fire from spreading for an additional 60
seconds, sometimes all the time needed to evacuate a burning
aircraft.
   A year after 23 people were killed in a 1983 smoky fire aboard
an Air Canada jetliner, the DOT ordered all aircraft with 30 seats
or more to install fire blocking material in all passenger seats
and floor-level lights to facilitate escape from an aircraft choked
with smoke.
   In 1988, additional safety rules were imposed after an agreement
between the FAA and the aviation industry on more stringent
flammability standards for aircraft cabin walls, ceilings and
storage bins.
   Northwest said it could not immediately determine whether the
DC-9, the oldest version of the McDonnell Douglas DC-9, was in full
compliance with the FAA's fire safety rules.

<TEXT>
   Senators Alan Cranston and Dennis DeConcini
contacted the top federal thrift regulator in support of Charles H.
Keating Jr.'s efforts to sell his troubled savings and loan shortly
before it was seized by the government, the official said today.
   M. Danny Wall, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, told the Senate Ethics Committee that Cranston, D-Calif.,
called him several times and met with him once shortly before
Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan collapsed April 14, 1989. They
met on April 7, a week before the collapse.
   Testifying in the case of the Keating Five senators, Wall said
both Cranston and DeConcini, D-Ariz., urged prompt action on
Keating's application to sell the thrift, and that Cranston urged
approval of the sale.
   Regulators rejected the sale on grounds the proposed buyers were
actually associates of Keating, and that Lincoln would not be made
economically viable.
   ``Senator Cranston urged that the board give prompt
consideration to the applications and that it approve any
legitimate proposal,'' Wall said.
   ``Senator DeConcini urged that the board give prompt
consideration to the proposals to sell Lincoln, but did not state
that he wanted a particular proposal to be accepted,'' he said.
   Under questioning by the committee's special counsel, Robert S.
Bennett, Wall said ``I don't recall'' discussing details of the
sales with Cranston.
   The contacts by both senators came in 1989, nearly two years
after regulators told the senators they were recommending criminal
referrals about Lincoln to the U.S. Justice Department.
   In one of his conversations, Wall said he told DeConcini of
objections the top California state regulator was raising about the
sale of Lincoln. They also may have discussed how Lincoln could
switch from a California charter to a federal charter, thus
avoiding the requirement that the California regulator, William J.
Crawford, approve any sale.
   That conversation was two weeks after Crawford had written Wall
expressing ``grave concerns'' about the transaction and warning
``do not be misled into believing'' that California officials would
approve the sale.
   He recalled calling Cranston the day the government seized
Lincoln to inform him. He said Cranston ``said something to the
effect, `I think the board has made a mistake. I hope you are
right.'''
   In his testimony, Wall described Keating as a ``master at
delay'' who kept regulators at bay while draining Lincoln of money.
   The Ethics Committee is investigating allegations the five
senators improperly intervened with regulators on Keating's behalf.
The financier and his associates gave $1.3 million to the senators'
campaigns and favored causes.
   Besides Cranston and DeConcini, senators under scrutiny are John
McCain of Arizona, the only Republican, and Democrats John Glenn of
Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan.
   Wall also testified that he didn't learn of his staff's
recommendation of a criminal investigation of Lincoln for more than
a year after five senators were informed by regulators on April 9,
1987.
   Wall said he met with Keating in September 1987 to discuss
Keating's concerns about regulators' examination of thrift. Wall
acknowledged telling Keating his staff would take a ``fresh look''
at the examination.
   Though the senators had been informed that April, Wall said he
was not told by his own staff of the criminal referral until May
1988.
   Wall, a former Republican Senate banking committee staffer,
became chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in 1987,
following Edwin J. Gray, who is now the chief witness against the
senators.
   Wall told the panel he received a telephone call from Cranston
in July or August 1987 expressing concern about the length of the
examination. He said Cranston told him ``we ought to make a
decision and get on with it.''
   Wall said he told Keating he would take a new look at the
Lincoln examination because he was setting up a new management
structure.
   ``I felt it was appropriate and desirable for us to determine
for ourselves'' what the result of the examination was and to ``try
to reconcile the differences'' between field examiners who
recommended the criminal referral and Washington regulators who had
not acted on the recommendation, he said.
   Meanwhile, law enforcement sources speaking on condition of
anonymity said Monday that the FBI is looking into the senators'
conduct as part of a wide-ranging investigation being coordinated
with federal prosecutors in Los Angeles and Phoenix.
   Examination of the senators' dealings with Keating is one aspect
of the broad federal criminal inquiry into allegations of financial
wrongdoing at Lincoln Savings and its parent, American Continental
Corp.

   The Soviet Union will raise the issue of direct
talks between Cuba and the United States at the next superpower
summit, the official Tass news agency said Tuesday.
   A similar report quoting Soviet diplomats in Havana was carried
by the Mexican news agency Notimex. The agency quoted Valery
Nikolaienko, the Soviet Foreign Ministry's director of Latin
American affairs, as saying it is time to end one of the last
remnants of the Cold War.
   Nikolaienko and another Soviet diplomat, Gregory Mamedov, spoke
with reporters after a meeting with Cuban President Fidel Castro,
Tass and Notimex said.
   Tass, in its report from the capital of the Communist island
nation, quoted the Soviet officials as saying the Soviet Union will
raise the issue of U.S.-Cuban relations at the next meeting between
President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   No firm date has been set for the next U.S.-Soviet summit, but
it could be held as early as January.
   The Soviets are prepared to facilitate an Cuban-American
dialogue, Tass said.
   Nikolaienko and Mamedov noted Soviet aid to Cuba has declined
this year but said the Kremlin was willing to maintain a policy of
cooperation and help for Cuba.
   The United States severed diplomatic relations with Cuba in
1961, two years after Castro came to power.

   House Democrats, under fire from Republicans
and private groups, on Tuesday withdrew a proposal to let lawmakers
collect unlimited contributions for their upcoming redistricting
fights.
   ``It will not happen. We're going to review the situation,''
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. and the speaker of the House, told
reporters just a day after his leadership team first made the
proposal public.
   The 1990 census will cause many states to change the boundaries
of their congressional districts. The new boundaries, which will
affect many 1992 House races, could wind up being settled in the
courts.
   Democratic rank-and-file members were to vote Tuesday on the
plan to allow members to set up special accounts, free from
fundraising or spending limits, to aid them in their expected legal
battles.
   Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Case, a group that lobbies
for tougher ethics standards, urged Democrats to reject it and
called the idea wrongheaded and ill-timed.
   ``It's as if no one there is paying any attention to the Keating
Five hearings going on across the street in the other chamber,''
Wertheimer said Monday, referring to the Senate ethics hearings on
alleged influence-peddling in the savings and loan industry.
   On Tuesday, House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., accused
the Democrats of trying to slip the plan by them.
   ``Why has there been no consultation ... on what could prove to
be significant changes in the way political funds can be raised by
members of this House?'' Michel and Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif.,
said in a joint letter to Foley.
   Foley announced that the plan was being withdrawn during a break
in the Democrats' closed-door meetings to plan for the new Congress
beginning in January.
   In addition to considering rules changes, the Democrats on
Tuesday ratified Foley's choice of Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., for
chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
   Fazio, who is also the vice chairman of the House Democratic
Caucus, succeeds Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., in the campaign post.

<HEAD>Government Says No Evidence Pan Am Terrorists Tied to DEA
Operation</HEAD>

   The Justice Department said Tuesday that a
month-long inquiry had produced no evidence that terrorists who
blew up Pan Am Flight 103 two years ago were unwittingly aided by
an undercover U.S. drug investigation.
   Neither the FBI, which is investigating the Dec. 21, 1988
bombing, nor the Drug Enforcement Administration found evidence to
substantiate broadcast reports that terrorists took advantage of an
undercover DEA operation to smuggle explosives aboard the plane.
   NBC and ABC both reported in late October that security at the
Frankfurt airport, where the New York-bound flight originated, had
been relaxed to accommodate DEA investigators who were tracking
U.S.-bound drug shipments.
   But Deputy Attorney General William P. Barr said in a statement
Tuesday that ``no evidence has been revealed to support any of the
allegations that a DEA operation was in any way involved in the Pan
Am tragedy.''
   ``DEA had no investigative or operational activity in effect on
Dec. 21, 1988 that involved the use of Pan Am Flight 103 or
Frankfurt International Airport,'' Barr said.
   A bomb destroyed the plane as it flew over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killing 259 people on board and 11 on the ground. The flight
originated in Frankfurt with a stop in London, where passengers and
luggage were transferred to another aircraft.
   Law enforcement officials in Britain and Germany continue to
investigate the bombing, along with the FBI.
   Investigators believe the bombing was carried out by members of
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, but the FBI has
not yet produced enough evidence to bring criminal charges against
specific individuals, according to law enforcement sources.
   Barr also said the DEA inquiry found that its agents ``did not
circumvent security measures'' at the Frankfurt airport at any
time.
   Barr's statement also discounted reports that one of the
passengers killed in the bombing, Khalid Nazir Jaafar, had been a
DEA informant and was cooperating in an undercover operation to
trace drug shipments from the Middle East to Detroit.
   Jaafar ``was not an informant nor was he working for the DEA in
any other capacity on Dec. 21, 1988, or at any other time,'' Barr
said the DEA had found. ``Allegations that Khalid Jaafar visited a
DEA office are incorrect.''
   The statement was issued as Attorney General Dick Thornburgh was
in the midst of a week-long European trip. On Wednesday, Thornburgh
is scheduled to attend the Rome conference of TREVI, an
organization of European law enforcement officials.
   DEA quickly denied the network reports after they were
broadcast, and the Justice Department said there was no evidence -
at that point - to substantiate them. But the Justice Department
ordered a further inquiry into the matter.

   Investigators working in a light snow on a
windy runway today surveyed the burned-out shell of a jetliner that
turned into the path of another, causing a collision that killed
eight people.
   The investigators' spokesman refused to respond to speculation
that fog disoriented the pilot of the DC-9, which collided Monday
with a Boeing 727 racing down a runway toward takeoff at Detroit
Metropolitan Airport.
   At least 20 people were treated for burns, broken bones, smoke
inhalation and other injuries, and seven remained in hospitals
today. Some had leapt to the slushy runway as an explosion of
flames burned the roof off their plane.
   The National Transportation Safety Board set up teams to look
into such factors as human performance, engines and survivors'
recollections. Before daybreak, investigators used stadium-style
lights to inspect the wreckage in 32-degree cold, with a wind chill
of 4 degrees.
   ``It's not particularly a benign environment out there right
now,'' John Lauber, a NTSB member, said at a morning briefing.
   Lauber said investigators were warned to be cautious in picking
through the unstable wreckage under time pressure caused by the
weather. Airport officials wanted the two planes, both operated by
Northwest Airlines, moved to reopen the only runway not affected by
crosswinds, Lauber said.
   Officials said the jets both left their gates at 1:31 p.m. and
ended up 2,500 feet apart on the same runway after the collision.
   The 727 was racing down a runway toward takeoff when its wing
was sheared off by the DC-9, which had turned in front of it. Fuel
poured from the planes and the DC-9 burst into flames, killing
seven men and one woman, a flight attendant, among the 43 people
aboard.
   The victims apparently died from noxious fumes before their
bodies were burned beyond recognition, Dr. Bader Cassin, chief
medical examiner for Wayne County, said today.
   ``It was like a big kerosene torch,'' said passenger John Izzo,
41, of Pittsburgh, who escaped uninjured by jumping off a wing.
   ``The only thing going through my mind was `I'm going to die in
this damn plane and I'm only 26 years old,''' said another
passenger, medical student Mike Marrone of Saddle River, N.J.
   The pilots survived the collision, authorities said. One was
treated at a hospital and released, and there was no word the
others were injured.
   Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said it was unclear who was at
the controls of the DC-9 - Pilot William Lovelace or First Officer
James S. Chifferns.
   Lovelace is a 24-year veteran of the airline who had been on a
medical leave for kidney stones for the past five years. Chifferns
joined Northwest seven months ago after 20 years in the Air Force.
   Flight 1482 was Lovelace's 13th since returning to work. His
previous flights had been observed by another Northwest pilot and
five were from Detroit.
   Gibbons identified the dead flight attendant as 43-year-old
Heidi Joost of the Detroit suburb of Dearborn.
   Crew members on both planes and air traffic controllers were
ordered to undergo drug tests, which are routine after such an
accident.
   It was not immediately known what instructions the DC-9 received
before straying into the path of the 727.
   Gibbons said, ``We don't know if the pilot got lost in the fog
or what. But that is a topic in the investigation.''
   At the time of the crash, visibility was estimated by the
controllers' union at a quarter-mile. The ground was wet from a
snow and sleet storm that delayed flights at the airport, which was
closed at the time to inbound flights.
   Lauber said the DC-9's ``black box'' recorders were sent to
Washington for analysis. He declined to speculate on the cause of
the crash.
   However, Tony Dresden, a spokesman for the National Air Traffic
Controllers, said the DC-9 pilot apparently got lost in the fog.
``The DC-9 pilot discovered at the very last moment where he was,
and so the ground controller told him to immediately get off that
runway, but it was too late,'' Dresden said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration had no immediate comment on
Dresden's statement.
   Air Line Pilots Association spokesman Al Pregler blasted the FAA
for not having installed a ground-level radar system at the airport
for avoiding collisions.
   ``We have been pushing them to do this for a long time, but they
haven't,'' Pregler said. ``It's expensive, and they don't want to
spend the money.''
   FAA spokeswoman Barb Dettmer said a system is scheduled for
installation next year.
   Airport officials said both planes left their gates at 1:31 p.m.
and headed onto fog-shrouded runways for takeoff.
   The DC-9, bound for Pittsburgh, carried 39 passengers and four
crew members. The 727 was headed for Memphis, Tenn., with 145
passengers and eight crew members.
   The 727 was about to go airborne when its right wing clipped the
DC-9 behind the co-pilot's seat, knocking off a rear-mounted
engine. Smoke billowed from the DC-9 fuselage, where passengers
apparently became trapped by the fast-moving fire.
   One of the injured was reported in critical condition.
   The only injuries suffered on the 727 were to people hurt
evacuating the plane.
   Robert Karp, 60, of Jackson, Miss., said he thought at first
that the 727 had simply blown a tire.
   ``The front end of the plane had begun to lift off,'' Karp said.
``I don't think the back wheels were off the ground yet. As soon as
I heard the thump we came to an abrupt stop. I remember looking at
the other plane and seeing smoke rolling out.''
   Romulus, 10 miles from Detroit, was the site of the second worst
air crash in U.S. history, the Aug. 16, 1987, crash of a Northwest
MD-80 on takeoff. That one killed 156.

   Israeli troops on Tuesday killed an armed
guerrilla in a firefight in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone
in southern Lebanon, the Israeli military command and Lebanese
security sources said.
   Two Israeli soldiers were slightly wounded in the clash, which
occurred in the western sector near the village of Ramayah, 13
miles southeast of the southern port city of Tyre, the Israeli army
said.
   ``Israeli forces from the Givati infantry brigade were on an
initiated action when they spotted a squad of guerrillas heading
toward the Israeli border and they opened fire from a short
distance,'' said the army statement, issued in Jerusalem.
   Lebanese security sources said the slain guerrilla was a
Palestinian.
   Troops found an anti-tank bazooka, grenade launchers, and
magazines from a Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifle near the body of
the slain guerrilla, the army said.
   The Moslem-run Voice of the Nation said the Israelis brought in
tanks to reinforce their troops, and helicopter gunships strafed
suspected guerrilla positions in the region after daybreak.
   Tuesday's clash followed a spate of incidents involving Israeli
soldiers or their militia allies in or around the
Israeli-controlled zone in southern Lebanon.
   On Monday, Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen killed five
guerrillas who, according to an army statement, belonged to a
Lebanese branch of the Baath party and the Lebanese Resistance
Front.
   Last week, five Israeli soldiers from the Givati brigade and two
Palestinian guerrillas were killed in a clash in the eastern sector
of the buffer zone. The army said those guerrillas belonged to the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a PLO faction led by
George Habash.
   Israel carved out the 440-square-mile buffer zone to protect its
northern border against guerrilla raids in 1985, when it withdrew
the bulk of its forces from Lebanon after a three-year occupation.
   The zone is jointly patrolled by Israeli soldiers and about
2,700 members of the mostly Christian South Lebanon Army militia.

   A Kremlin official said Tuesday that a new job
apparently is in the works for Vadim Bakatin, the interior minister
dismissed by President Mikhail Gorbachev two days earlier.
   A Soviet newspaper said Gorbachev might name Bakatin to the new
post of vice president. Bakatin also was being considered to head
the new National Security Council, the German newspaper Bild
reported.
   Neither Gorbachev nor Bakatin commented on the unconfirmed
reports in Komsomolskaya Pravda and Bild. The newspapers did not
give sources for their reports.
   Bild also reported that Gorbachev is likely to step down as
Communist Party chief by the end of the year, while remaining
president, a once purely ceremonial post that he has built into a
powerful office.
   Last week, Gorbachev again denied that he plans to quit as the
party's general secretary.
   Dozens of ministers are expected to lose their positions as
Gorbachev trims the Cabinet from 56 to about 15 officials.
   At the Supreme Soviet legislature, some lawmakers hotly debated
the motives for the Cabinet shakeup. Hard-line legislators praised
Gorbachev's decision to dismiss Bakatin and replace him with a KGB
general who is expected to crack down on independence movements in
the republics.
   But the newspaper reports raisedthe possibility that Gorbachev
could be feinting left and striking right: removing a favorite of
reformists only to place him in a more important post.
   Bakatin is popular with reformers who support the independence
movements in the Baltics and other republics, because he put a
tighter rein on riot police after 19 peaceful demonstrators were
killed by troops last year.
   Presidential spokesman Vitaly Ignatenko told reporters Bakatin
was not removed from the interior minister's job because of any
dissatisfaction with his performance.
   ``I believe that a new post is in line for him, but we have to
patient to see what that post will be, and only after that will we
be able to make conclusions,'' Ignatenko said.
   The Interior Ministry, meanwhile, released figures showing
violent crime has jumped 12 percent this year, to the highest level
in a decade. But ministry officials defended Bakatin as a
hard-working and intelligent boss, and attributed the increased
crime to the sagging economy and shortages of consumer goods -
problems beyond his control.
   Bakatin's removal ``was as unexpected for us as it was for
you,'' Interior Ministry Gen. Boris B. Dziov told reporters. ``But
obviously the political leadership knows what it's doing, and it's
difficult for us to judge.''
   Bakatin was replaced by Boris Pugo, 53, a Communist Party
official who became a KGB major general while running the secret
police in Latvia in the early 1980s. His new deputy is army Gen.
Boris Gromov, a 47-year-old hard-liner who commanded Soviet troops
in Afghanistan and criticized Gorbachev's cuts in defense spending.
   Pugo said in an interview published in the government newspaper
Izvestia on Tuesday that the increase in crime ``cannot be
tolerated.'' He said Gorbachev was particularly concerned about
organized crime, corruption and the creation of independent
militias in republics such as Moldavia and Georgia.
   ``I regard the republics' sovereignty with understanding. But
without infringing on the right of republics ... efforts should be
pooled in order to struggle against grave crimes and prevent
outbursts of violence on ethnic grounds,'' Pugo said.

<HEAD>Two Admirals Dismissed for Failure to Report Stealth Problems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy said Tuesday it is forcing out the
three top overseers of its classified A-12 stealth bomber program,
including two admirals, for their failure to disclose serious flaws
in the aircraft's development.
   The extraordinary action by Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett
III was announced by the service as the Pentagon released an
internal Navy report that outlined a startling breakdown in
government and Navy supervision of the six-year-old bomber program.
   The A-12 ``Avenger'' is the Navy's top aircraft priority. The
carrier-based aircraft is scheduled to begin replacing the Navy's
aging fleet of A-6 Intruder attack planes in 1995 and to serve as a
mainstay well into the 21st century.
   Controversy over the plane's development, now more than a year
behind schedule and at least 20 percent over the planned $4.7
billion cost, heated up in June, when the contractors, General
Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas, told the Navy they could not
produce the first plane on time, that costs were escalating and
that it could not meet certain performance standards for the
aircraft.
   Just a few weeks earlier, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had
announced, after a high-level review of the A-12 program, that the
project was fully on track.
   Garrett wrote in a memo to Cheney dated Nov. 29 that the Navy's
A-12 program supervisors failed to make clear to top Navy and
Pentagon leadership that the aircraft's development was faring much
worse than the contractor claimed.
   Garrett told Cheney he was forcing Vice Adm. Richard C. Gentz,
commander of Naval Air Systems Command, to retire by Feb. 1. He
also said he was reassigning the program executive officer for
tactical aircraft programs, Rear Adm. John F. Calvert, and the A-12
program manager, Capt. Lawrence G. Elberfeld.
   Calvert and Elberfeld also received letters of censure from the
Navy secretary, although Garrett said he would not stop Elberfeld's
scheduled promotion to rear admiral.
   Attempts to reach the three officers were unsuccessful. Calls to
Gentz' office were not answered; an aide in Elberfeld's office said
he was out of town and could not be reached, and an aide to Calvert
said his boss would not comment.
   A statement issued in Cheney's name Tuesday said he was troubled
by the conclusions of a separate A-12 investigation by the
Pentagon's inspector general. Cheney ordered Deputy Defense
Secretary Donald Atwood to make recommendations for corrective
action when Cheney returns from Europe next week.
   A central theme of both the internal Navy report and the
Pentagon inspector general's investigation is that overly
optimistic cost and schedule estimates of the contractors were not
sufficiently challenged by the government. The investigations also
said official secrecy helped mask the project's problems.
   The Navy report said McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics
contract officials failed to tell the Navy of cost and schedule
problems they knew existed. It said the contract officials felt
pressured by upper management at McDonnell Douglas and General
Dynamics to avoid making forcasts of cost or schedule overruns
because such problems would reduce contract payments to the
companies.
   In its report, the inspector general's office cited an instance
in which General Dynamics required government inspectors at the
company's A-12 plant in Fort Worth, Texas, to turn over their notes
to review them for security classification. One set of notes was
lost, and it later was determined that they had contained no secret
information anyway.
   ``We question any procedure by which a contractor obtains access
to, and control over, the work product of government personnel
engaged in oversight duties,'' the report said.
   The inspector general was highly critical of the role of John A.
Betti, the under secretary of defense for acquisition. It said he
put too much credence in assurances by the contractors that the
project could be completed on time and within the cost ceiling, and
that he dismissed warnings by lower-level Pentagon officials that
the project was encountering serious problems.
   ``We find Mr. Betti's failure especially troublesome in view of
a prior warning within the (office of the secretary of defense) of
cost growth on the A-12 program,'' Susan J. Crawford, the inspector
general, wrote in a letter to Rep. Andy Ireland, R-Fla.
   Ireland, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said in
a statement released Tuesday that the inspector general's report
illustrated a fundamental flaw in the Pentagon's system of
assigning responsibility for weapons development.
   ``Program managers are giving assurances about contractors'
adherence to budgets based largely on the word of the contractors
themselves,'' he wrote. ``It is a process ripe for abuse.''

<HEAD>Hospitals in `No-Win Situation' Over AIDS Testing, Have Varying
Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most U.S. hospitals surveyed have admitted at
least one AIDS patient, but their policies on testing for AIDS vary
widely, often pitting the interests of patients against those of
doctors and nurses, researchers say.
   ``To a certain extent, hospitals are in a no-win situation,
since policy provisions protecting patients may be incompatible
with provisions protecting health-care personnel,'' said the
researchers, who surveyed 561 hospitals.
   ``Not only do hospitals face potential risk of litigation from
patients for violation of their rights, but hospitals also may be
held responsible for placing healt  care personnel at increased
risk by withholding relevant information about infected patients,''
the researchers said.
   They drew their sample randomly from a list of all non-federal
general acute-care hospitals with more than 25 beds, and reported
their findings in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   About two-thirds of the hospitals had at least one AIDS patient,
including 40 percent of rural hospitals, indicating AIDS is no
longer a disease of big cities, said Dr. Charles E. Lewis,
professor of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.
   He and Kathleen Montgomery of the University of California,
Riverside, found that 83 percent of hospitals have formal written
policies about testing patients for infection with HIV, the AIDS
virus.
   Most policies have provisions protecting patients' rights, the
researchers found. For example, 78 percent required the patient's
informed consent before the test, whether written or verbal; 66
percent required a written consent; and 75 percent required that
patients who tested positive be told the results.
   Many policies also had provisions protecting health-care
workers, the researchers said. For example, 56 percent required
that test results appear in patients' records; 38 percent required
a review of treatment plans when a patient tests positive; and 3
percent required that HIV-positive patients be discharged or
transferred.
   Carisa Cunningham, a New York spokeswoman for an AIDS activist
group, said patient care should be first priority in any hospital's
policy.
   ``The question we always ask is, what is the information needed
for? Who needs it, and why?'' said Cunningham, of the Gay Men's
Health Crisis.
   ``If health care providers want the information so they can
transfer a patient to another hospital and not have to deal with
them, that's not acceptable.''
   Dr. Frank Rhame, director of the HIV Clinic at the University of
Minnesota Hospital in Minneapolis, said the study is the largest to
explore policies about HIV testing at U.S. hospitals.
   But he cautioned that policies and actual practices often
differ.
   ``What most people have recommended, and what's actually being
done and what the policy may be are at considerable variance,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
   ``I think that it's important to evaluate the actual practice,''
he said. ``It's harder. You've actually got to go in the hospital
and get a record of every HIV test that's been performed and verify
that the patient was notified.''

<HEAD>HUD Tightens Homeless Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development has tightened its housing eligibility rules after
learning that Texas businessmen and church leaders were living in
units designated for homeless.
   James Forsberg, director of HUD's program of homeless housing,
confirmed the situation uncovered by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram,
but said regional administrators in other parts of the country told
him they knew of no similar problems.
   ``It would appear right now that the issue has been limited to
Texas, and probably the northern part of Texas,'' Forsberg said
Tuesday.
   The Star-Telegram, in a story in Sunday's editions, reported
that:
   -Businessman and part-time street minister Roy Gray of Keller
rents a $92,500 home in the upscale Dallas suburb of Rowlett for $1
a year.
   -Baptist minister Bill Robinson has moved into a two-story home
in Arlington, Texas, appraised at $92,000, under the program,
although the net worth of his non-profit company will soon exceed
$1 million.
   ``Those people were there,'' Forsberg said. ``They shouldn't
have been, but nobody can dispute the fact they were. We will move
to get them out.''
   Forsberg said rules were changed Monday during a series of
meetings with HUD officials, including Secretary Jack Kemp.
   ``We tightened up to say the purpose of the program is to help
people who are homeless and had no other resources that they could
use to find housing elsewhere,'' Forsberg said. ``Looking at some
of the people they have identified, it is clear they had resources
they could have used to find housing on the market.''
   Gray and Robinson defended their placement in HUD homes, saying
that they, their relatives and associates qualified as homeless.
   The earlier regulations had defined a homeless person as
virtually anyone without a permanent home, regardless of income.
   Kemp launched the program after he took office in February 1989.
It makes available up to 10 percent of 50,000 foreclosed homes that
the federal government owns.
   Forsberg said field offices had been given additional guidance
on screening the non-profit organizations applying to administer
housing under the program.
   He said the objective was to see that they had experience in
helping the homeless and had the financial resources to manage the
units without relying on rent from high-income people. He said a
new effort would also be made to ``make sure the non-profits can
bring appropriate social services to bear.''
   Under the program, churches and non-profit groups lease
foreclosed HUD homes for $1 a year and then rent them to the
homeless for modest fees, usually about $250 a month. They also can
buy the properties at a 10 percent discount.
   HUD spokesman Jack Flynn said the new rules would include a
requirement that the property be dedicated to use for the homeless
for 10 years after being purchased.
   The regulations will be subject to a period of public comment
after being published in the Federal Register.

   Former hostages who returned home from Iraq
early Tuesday with retired boxing champ Muhammad Ali said their
happiness was tempered with concern for those left behind.
   ``I just wanted to make sure that everybody here realizes that
there are hundreds of more Americans and thousands in total of
foreigners still there,'' Harry Brill-Edwards, 49, of Fort Lee,
N.J., told reporters after arriving at Kennedy Airport.
   ``Every one of us who is on this plane tonight is only happy to
a certain degree. The rest of his heart is sad for the guys who are
still there.''
   The State Department says about 1,000 Americans are trapped in
Iraq and Kuwait, and it believes 88 are being used as ``human
shields'' at strategic sites. Iraq released 15 Americans to Ali,
including 10 with medical conditions.
   A few hours after the hostages' arrival, a group of Americans
boarded the same plane back to Amman, Jordan, in hopes of reunions
Wednesday in Baghdad with relatives they are trying to bring home.
   Brill-Edwards, chairman of Chromolloy Corp. in Orangeburg, N.Y.,
was one of six Americans who accompanied Ali directly from Jordan.
The nine others were returning to the United States via the
Netherlands.
   Only Brill-Edwards had family waiting in New York: wife Heidi,
sons Christopher, 14, and Philip, 9, and daughter Alexandra, 16,
who gave Ali a hug and kiss before leaving.
   Former hostage Sergio Coletta of Moss Point, Miss., was greeted
by three colleagues from the American Bureau of Shipping, his
employer, and when he saw them waiting, he ran into their arms.
   Royce ``Red'' Smart, a drilling consultant from Houston, said
his ``heart hurts'' for those left behind who were ``just like me,
hoping someone would come get them, some way, somehow.''
   Richard Iliff, a General Motors executive from Atlanta, said he
was ``choked up'' about the close friends he had made in more than
100 days of captivity. ``They're stuck. I don't know how they're
going to get out, unless somebody goes out and gets them or Saddam
Hussein changes his mind.''
   The former hostages said they were not mistreated. They said
they were fed regularly, if not always adequately.
   ``I don't think I'll eat tomatoes or cucumbers again for life,''
said Iliff.
   The ex-hostages said they were moved several times. Iliff said
his shelter during captivity ranged from a trailer to a
three-bedroom house. They fought off boredom by playing cars,
exercising, taking walks and swapping novels.
   As time passed and captors became familiar with the prisoners,
conditions improved, but ``a lot depended on the political hassle
that went on in the press,'' Brill-Edwards said. ``As things got
tough politically, things got tougher in the camps.''
   None of the captives knew how they were chosen for freedom.
Smart theorized he had been ``picked out of a hat.'' They were
given as little as 15 minutes notice that they were being freed.
   Ali did not speak during the brief session with reporters, but
an attorney, Paul Sanchi, read a statement from Ali that said,
``I'm on the side of Al Islam, which means peace.''
   The hostages praised him as a gentleman and a ``super human
being.''
   The other returning hostages were George Chanchalis of Reno,
Nev., and Ralph Leidholdt of Lakewood, Colo.

   President Bush called for a
``permanent partnership among all nations of the Americas'' as he
arrived today in one of South America's smallest countries. He
played down the importance of the military uprising in neighboring
Argentina, his next stop.
   At a news conference after talks with President Luis Alberto
Lacalle, Bush pronounced Argentina ``democratically stable'' and
said the turmoil that erupted Tuesday was not aimed at the elected
government but was a ``military vs. military'' issue.
   Several hundred leftist demonstrators assembled 150 yards from
the legislative assembly where Bush addressed a joint session of
Congress.
   At an airport welcoming ceremony, Bush said, ``We in the
Americas are on the brink of something unprecedented in world
history - the first wholly democratic hemisphere.''
   ``In anticipation of that, we need to create together a
permanent partnership among all the nations of the Americas,'' said
Bush, the first American president to visit Uruguay since Lyndon
Johnson in 1967. Bush was underscoring the primary focus of his
trip - a salute to democracy - and his proposal for free trade
throughout the hemisphere.
   Thousands of people lined Bush's motorcade route through the
streets of Montevideo. The crowds were overwhelmingly friendly,
although there were clusters of demonstrators making rude hand
gestures and waving signs.
   After their talks at the Edificio Libertad, the president's
headquarters, Bush and Lacalle both spoke of the importance of
lifting barriers to international trade, including farm subsidies.
Trade talks are now in their final days in Brussels in the effort
to rewrite the global trading rules last forged in Uruguay five
years ago.
   ``We are in the same boat with the GATT negotiations,'' said
Lacalle, who said ``cutthroat'' tariffs have hurt ``millions of
people.''
   ``We foresee a whole hemisphere of much more open trade,'' said
Bush, who exhorted developing countries to ``move briskly to
privatization, to free markets'' in order to attract investments
and new technology.
   Bush said he was ``very pleased'' to be going to Buenos Aires on
Wednesday, and said he did not view Monday's brief military
rebellion as a sign of instability in Argentina. Four of the five
countries that Bush is visiting this week emerged from military
rule in the 1980s.
   Bush also said he would have no trouble working with socialists,
but ``the whole world'' is moving in the opposite direction from
that ``failed formula.''
   Leftist demonstrators were scheduled to stage a protest to
coincide with an afternoon speech Bush planned to the national
legislature. There also were calls for a mass protest tonight after
Bush's departure from Montevideo for the resort city of Punta del
Este.
   Uruguay is one of the few countries left with a strong left-wing
movement. Uruguayan radicals oppose Bush's call for market-oriented
economies in Latin America.
   The president did not mention the troubles in neighboring
Argentina where the government put down a military coup attempt a
day earlier.
   U.S. officials were not surprised that a military rebellion in
Argentina fizzled, but there were lingering concerns over Bush's
safety.
   As the president made the rounds of Brasilia on Monday, the
initial assessments of the situation in Argentina were uniformly
upbeat. ``I have great confidence in the security there,'' Bush
said, vowing to go ahead with the trip Wednesday.
   By evening, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
betrayed some doubt, saying, ``If the situation became such that
there was a real danger to his (Bush's) security, I'm sure we'd
take another look at it.'' Hours later, the last of the rebels had
surrendered. Thirteen people were reported killed.
   For the administration, the most reassuring aspect about the
Argentine upheaval was that the rebels said they had no intention
of ousting the 17-month-old elected government of President Carlos
S. Menem. They said they merely wanted to call attention to their
grievances. Officials were confident Menem was in no danger of
being overthrown.
   Still, the timing for Bush could hardly have been worse. He
wanted to use this trip partly to call attention to the
hemisphere's democratic development over the past decade.
   Bush said in a speech to the Brazilian legislature on Monday
that the hemisphere had embarked on a ``new era of hope,'' a
statement that did not blend well with the scenes of violence
occurring next door in Argentina, including some near Menem's
office in Buenos Aires.
   Francisco Rezek, Brazil's foreign minister, called the revolt in
Argentina ``a step backward for democracy in Latin America.''
   A highlight of the president's visit to Brazil was the
announcement of approval by Bush to license the sale of a
high-performance computer, with potential military uses, that
Brazil had sought for two years. The U.S. move was prompted by
Brazil's having joined with Argentina last week in renouncing the
manufacture of nuclear weapons.
   The president also praised Brazil for being among the first
countries to impose economic sanctions against Iraq last August.
   Aside from celebrating democracy, a main purpose of Bush's tour
is to promote his vision of a hemisphere-wide free trade area and
to encourage the trend toward growth-oriented economic policies.
   After his visit Wednesday to Argentina, Bush flies to Chile on
Thursday and heads home Saturday after a visit to Venezuela.

Says</HEAD>

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Tuesday he
will crack down on black marketeering and boost food imports to
feed the nation this winter, and he wants people to plant their own
gardens to raise food next year.
   ``Rural and urban residents should be free to pursue
agriculture,'' Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet legislature, which
has demanded urgent steps to ease the food crisis.
   Gorbachev also outlined proposed changes in the governmen,
including the creation of a vice presidency and a Security Council.
They also would streamline the Cabinet and strengthen the
Federation Council, which includes representatives of the
republics.
   Those changes require constitutional amendments, and the Supreme
Soviet legislature voted 281-17 to recommend that the larger
Congress of Peoples' Deputies amend the charter when it convenes on
Dec. 17.
   Despite the lopsided vote, many legislators said they were
disappointed Gorbachev did not give more details on either the food
program or government restructuring, which he first outlined on
Nov. 17.
   ``A lot of questions remain,'' said Fyodor Burlatsky, a
reformer. ``The president explained some general ideas, but we
don't know the real functions for the new institutions.''
   Gorbachev, after fielding questions from legislators, said he
rejected accusations that the proposed changes reflected ``imperial
ambitions'' for the strengthened office of president, the official
news agency Tass reported.
   The president provided the most detailed statistics yet on the
food the Soviet Union plans to import with foreign aid he has
secured over the past two months.
   During the first three months of 1991, he said the government
would spend about $1.2 billion on food. That included 10 million
tons of grain, 1.9 million tons of sugar, 156,000 tons of flour,
277,000 tons of sunflower oil, 357,000 tons of meat and meat
products, 4.5 million tons of milk products and 110,000 tons of
groats.
   The United States, Germany and Italy have begun sending food aid
to the Soviet Union, and other nations have pledged support. Soviet
officials blame food problems on the collapse of the central
distribution system.
   Gorbachev said workers' control committees would be formed over
the next two or three weeks to make sure food is not diverted to
the black market from the state distribution system. The KGB
security police and state prosecutors have also been assigned to
this task, Soviet officials have said.
   ``A survey by security bodies of 50 stores in Moscow has shown
that when the stores close, a `third shift' starts working. The
same thing happens at warehouses,'' Gorbachev said. Workers often
set aside scarce food for sale to acquaintances at inflated prices.
   ``A new system is being created that will put the situation
under strict control,'' he said. ``We will take resolute actions.''
   While tight controls and imports might ease the food crisis for
the next three or four months, Gorbachev said, food supplies could
be increased if people were allowed to work their own gardens. He
said he would seek up to 12 million acres for ``private plot''
farming.
   The parliament of the Russian Federation, the largest of the 15
Soviet republics, on Monday authorized private ownership of
farmland, but Gorbachev balked at that step, and the garden plots
will remain under state and collective ownership.
   Gorbachev also repeated plans to rename the Council of Ministers
the Cabinet of Ministers, under the direction of a prime minister,
to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the legislature.
Aides said Cabinet membership would drop from 56 ministers to about
15.
   The Cabinet of Ministers would be responsible to the president,
and control the national budget, energy industries, transportation,
environmental protection, and credit and foreign currency.
   The Cabinet also would work with the republics on a national
program for health insurance, maternity and child care issues,
culture and education and basic scientific research.
   Gorbachev said he would create a vice presidency, ``to be the
president's right-hand man.''
   He also would abolish the Presidential Council, created earlier
this year. Some of its members, probably the defense and interior
ministers and head of the KGB, would be transferred to the new
Security Council.
   Gorbachev also would expand the powers of the Federation
Council, which includes leaders of the 15 republics. It will be
responsible for ethnic issues and relations among the national and
republican governments.

<HEAD>German Social Democrats Struggle to Repair Image After Election
Debacle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Germany's Social Democrats, facing their
worst crisis in years, are reeling from an election debacle and
desperately seeking a youthful leader with the talents of senior
party member Willy Brandt.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition defeated the Social
Democrats, led by challenger Oskar Lafontaine, in Sunday's
election, the first all-German balloting in 58 years.
   The Social Democrats are a party without a platform, crippled by
internal divisions and in need of fresh leadership.
   ``The Social Democrats' biggest problem is their dearth of
solidarity,'' said Renate Koecher, a researcher at the Allensbach
polling institute.
   They lost a half-million votes to Kohl's Christian Democrats in
the opposition party's worst electoral showing since 1957. It was
the Social Democrats' third defeat by Kohl since he came to power
eight years ago.
   Kohl's grasp on Germany's leadership is already being compared
to that of Konrad Adenauer, West Germany's first chancellor, who
held office for 14 years.
   ``It really is now a fairly unbalanced political system, with a
very strong predominance of the government parties,'' said Peter
Pulzer, an Oxford University Germany specialist who observed the
elections.
   It took Brandt finally to dislodge Adenauer's Christian
Democrats in 1969. The Social Democrats are now hunting for a
leader who can do the same to Kohl.
   Brandt, 76, is the Social Democrats' most popular member and is
respected throughout the party.
   The Social Democrats' national image has been badly tarnished as
a result of Sunday's election and their campaign tactics.
   Lafontaine refused to embrace fully German unity during the
campaign. The resulting damage was especially severe in former East
Germany, where the party captured only 25 percent of the vote.
Social Democrats are now viewed by many there as political pariahs.
   ``The party leadership needs rejuvenation,'' said national
chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel, who on Tuesday announced plans to step
down.
   The party offered the leadership to 47-year-old Lafontaine, but
he turned it down, saying he is too busy as governor of Saarland
state. He also complained about the half-hearted support his
campaign received among some Social Democrats.
   ``It is impossible to conduct an election campaign without
solidarity,'' Lafontaine said Tuesday.
   Other possible candidates for the top party job include Johannes
Rau, Walter Momper and Bjoern Engholm.
   Rau, 59, is the popular governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, but
he lost heavily to Kohl in the 1987 chancellor race.
   Momper, the 45-year-old former mayor of Berlin, had been seen as
a rising star within the Social Democrats' ranks, but he lost in
Berlin city elections on Sunday.
   Engholm, the 51-year-old governor of Schleswig-Holstein state,
is a dapper, pipe-smoking intellectual popular in his home state.
   One of the Social Democrats' best orators - 47-year-old Herta
Daeubler-Gmelin - has also been mentioned for the job.
   Regardless of who becomes the new party leader, observers say
the Social Democrats also need new ideas.
   Lafontaine spent most of his campaign warning against the
pitfalls of unification, rather than proposing how unity's problems
- like high unemployment in former East Germany - can be solved.
   ``The SPD should wholeheartedly say that unification is a
positive development,'' said Ms. Koecher of the Allensbach
institute.
   ``Secondly, they should see the new German states (East Germany)
as new turf where they have to be intensively engaged.''
   If the Social Democrats can succeed in making friends out of
enemies in eastern Germany, ``they certainly have a chance to
become far stronger,'' Ms. Koecher said.

<HEAD>Rebel Commander Named Interim Leader in Chad</HEAD>

<DATELINE>N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel commander Idriss Deby on Tuesday
was named interim leader of Chad and immediately called for unity.
He also said he would implement multiparty democracy in this nation
of 5.4 million residents.
   Deby, who ousted President Hissene Habre after three weeks of
fighting, promised democratic reforms in a nationwide radio
address.
   ``I stress that there cannot be democracy without political
pluralism and secularity,'' he said. He called on Chadian
oppositionists in exile to return, saying he was ``inviting all the
sons of Chad to a sincere pardon to solve our problems
democratically.''
   He also expressed his determination to keep the mineral-rich
Aouzou Strip in northern Chad, which is claimed by Libya.
   ``We will defend our national unity, the territorial integrity
of Chad within its borders inherited from colonization,'' Deby said
in a nationwide radio address.
   ``Chad will pursue a policy of good neighborliness and
non-interference with its neighbors,'' Deby said.
   Deby, 38, was named interim head of state by the Executive
Committee of his Patriotic Salvation Movement. The duration of his
term was not announced.
   The Executive Committee created a State Council under Deby's
control and replaced the nation's Constitution, which had been
suspended Monday when Deby dissolved the National Assembly.
   Deby had said earlier that he wanted to establish a democratic
government as quickly as possible, French Ambassador to Chad
Francois Gendreau said.
   Gendreau also indicated that France, which beefed up its
military forces in Chad by 500 troops to 1,800 last week, would not
attempt to intervene. Chad is a former French protectorate and was
incorporated into French Equatorial Africa before gaining
independence in 1960.
   French Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said France,
which withdrew 150 soldiers Tuesday, decided to remain neutral
during the war in its former colony.
   ``We did not let Hissene Habre fall,'' he said. ``We simply gave
the order for our Jaguars (warplanes) to not bomb or strafe Idriss
Deby's columns.''
   Habre fled the country, reportedly to neighboring Cameroon, on
Saturday after a three-week war in which government troops were
routed by rebel soldiers loyal to Deby.
   A day later Deby made a triumphant entry into N'Djamena.
   The rebels received 40 percent of their weapons from Libya,
according to French officials. Deby distanced himself from Libya by
ruling out negotiations on the Aouzou Strip, but allowed Libyan
prisoners of war to return home Monday.
   On Monday Deby began a series of consultations, meeting with
U.S. Ambassador Richard Bogosian and senior Libyan officials,
including the army chief of staff. There were no immediate details
of their talks.
   Habre took his family and eight Cabinet ministers to Maroua in
Cameroon, according to the state newspaper The Cameroon Tribune.
   It quoted one of the exiled Chadians as saying Habre was the
``victim of a foreign conspiracy'' and fled to avoid ``a
humiliation like that of Samuel Doe.'' Doe, the former president of
Liberia, was captured and killed by Liberian rebels in August.
   Deby was Habre's chief aide in a 1982 coup, but broke away last
year and formed a rebel movement. Habre and U.S. officials claim
Libya actively backed Deby's rebellion, but the Libyans and Deby
deny it.
   A dusk-to-dawn curfew remained in effect following widespread
looting Saturday, but residents said N'Djamena had been calm since
then.
   Libya's army occupied northern Chad in 1983 and 1986, prompting
France to send troops to back Habre. Libya was driven out in a
series of battles masterminded by Deby in 1987.

<HEAD>City Council Moves to Curtail Cigarette Sales</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-EPA-Smoking, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia Council moved to
sharply restrict cigarette sales in the nation's capital Tuesday by
passing a bill banning cigarette vending machines from most
restaurants.
   The legislation also prohibits the sale of cigarettesoor other
tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18, and forbids the
distribution of free cigarette samples on city streets.
   ``We're not trying to stop people from buying cigarettes,'' said
council member Nadine Winter, the bill's sponsor. ``We're trying to
limit access to youths, to keep them from dying.''
   Under the old city law, anyone 16 or older could buy cigarettes.
   An amendment to the bill allows vending machines in restaurants
where they can be monitored by employees.
   The bill passed by voice vote despite the protests of council
members who complained that the rights of smokers were being
violated.
   ``I believe this does not do enough to protect the rights of
smokers,'' said council member Harry Thomas. ``I'm a smoker, but I
just think that this is too conservative.''
   Supporters of the legislation described it as an attempt to
lower the cancer rate in the nation's capital. City records show
that in the district and across the nation cancer is the
second-leading cause of death, trailing only heart disease.
   By passing the bill, the nation's capital becomes the fourth
major city to curtail cigarette sales. Salt Lake City and
Minneapolis already have prohibitions on some forms of cigarette
sales, and the New York City council voted earlier this month to
ban cigarette vending machines except in taverns.

   The schools chancellor wants to make condoms
available to public high school students to help lower the rate of
teen-age AIDS cases in the city, which he said is the highest in
the country.
   The issue ``requires that we acknowledge that young people are
sexually active and engaging in high-risk behaviors,'' said Schools
Chancellor Joseph Fernandez.
   ``New York City is leading the nation in adolescent AIDS
cases,'' he said. ``With courage and conviction we can provide our
youth with the facts, the skills and the confidence to protect
themselves.''
   Fernandez's plan would make condoms available on request to any
of the city's 260,000 high school students at each of the more than
100 schools. A requesting child would remain anonymous and would
not need approval of a parent.
   The condoms would be dispensed from a site in each high school
staffed by two adult volunteers from the school, one man and one
woman. The staffers would be able, but not required, to offer
counseling.
   Sex and AIDS education are already part of the regular
curriculum in elementary and secondary grades. Each high school
would be responsible for setting up its own program under whatever
guidelines the board adopts.
   A majority of the seven-member school board, which sets general
policy for the city's million-child public school system, has
supported the idea of condom availability, accompanied by sex and
AIDS counseling, at the 17 high schools that have their own health
clinics.
   But board member Westina L. Matthews called Fernandez's proposal
``much broader than I originally understood,'' and she said Tuesday
she was not sure how she would vote.
   Michael J. Petrides, a board member who favors more sex and AIDS
education but opposes condom distribution, maintained that handing
out contraceptives signals to a teen-ager that it is OK to be
sexually active.
   ``And I don't believe the number of AIDS cases will go down
because kids are getting condoms,'' he said.
   At its meeting Wednesday, the board will discuss distributing
condoms. A vote could come early in January, said James Vlasto, the
chancellor's spokesman.

   Merchants criticized police response as they
angrily cleaned up Tuesday from a night of looting and fires
triggered by the acquittal of six police officers in the fatal
beating of a Puerto Rican drug dealer.
   Fire officials estimated the fire damage alone at $2.9 million.
   Police Chief Perry Anderson said police could have moved in
earlier. But he defended his department, saying there were no
deaths or violent clashes with police.
   Mayor Xavier Suarez met with leaders in the largely Puerto Rican
Wynwood community to look into reasons for the rioting, which
police and city officials admitted caught them by surprise.
   Merchants complained that police took too long - more than two
hours - to move in Monday night after hundreds of youths swarmed
through usually tranquil streets, looting stores and burning down
businesses.
   The riot followed acquittal of six police officers accused of
beating to death Leonardo Mercado, a Puerto Rican-born cocaine
dealer.
   ``The police knew it was going to happen and they just sat back
and did nothing, absolutely nothing,'' said Richard Munoz, who owns
Los Hispanos Supermarket.
   Munoz said his small grocery store was not damaged because he
scared off the looters.
   ``I spent all night armed and on the roof,'' Munoz said.
   Other merchants were busy sweeping up broken glass and cleaning
soot.
   Police estimate about 300 people were involved in the rioting at
its height. From 10 to 15 people were arrested on charges of
disorderly conduct and inciting to riot, said George Law, a police
spokesman.
   Residents said many looters were not from their neighborhood,
but came in from other parts of the city to take advantage of the
anger in the northwestern Miami community.
   The trouble began shortly after nightfall, nearly six hours
after a federal jury found the members of an elite drug squad
innocent of conspiracy in the killing of Mercado, who was from the
neighborhood.
   The jury deadlocked on more serious charges of violating the
civil rights of Mercado when he was beaten to death two years ago
and Judge Stanley Marcus declared a mistrial.
   The trial's end set off the city's fifth riot in just more than
a decade, the first involving the usually low-profile Puerto Rican
community rather than black neighborhoods.
   Mercado's sister-in-law, Rosa Allende, said some Puerto Ricans
feel the need for revenge.
   ``It's not going to change things, but it's a start to let them
know it's not only the blacks who get angry,'' she said. ``They
said he (Mercado) was a low-life cockroach. But he had children. A
life is a life.''
   Some business owners said they got telephone calls in the
afternoon, warning them there might be trouble and to close down
their shops.
   ``They (the police) knew all about it,'' said Ricky Perez, whose
parents' shoe store was vandalized.
   ``We called the police and they told us to close down the store
and go home. They (the police) were just down the streets, watching
them taking TVs and they didn't do nothing about it,'' Perez said.
   Suarez conceded the police did not react swiftly enough. But he
said officials did not expect the number of people involved from
other parts of the city.
   ``We were caught a little bit by surprise,'' Suarez said.
``We're going to have to investigate ... and see if it wasn't some
sort of predisposed or pre-organized element to this.''
   Anderson agreed the 200-member riot squad came in too late. But
he noted that in a recent confrontation with Haitian demonstrators,
police were criticized for moving in too quickly.
   ``With this particular situation we took two hours to respond,
and we should have gone in a lot quicker,'' Anderson said. ``So
what I'm saying is, you're damned if you do and damned if you
don't.''
   Fire investigator John Calpini said two stores were destroyed by
fire. Other damage appeared limited to a few buildings.
   Patrick Gerrits, wiped away tears as he watched investigators
rummaging through the rubble of his family's construction company.
   Gerrits' company, which was hardest hit, operated in the same
spot since his father started it in 1946.
   ``They (just about) killed my daddy when they burned this
building,'' Gerrits said. ``And it'll probably kill my mama. The
whole highlight of her life was coming in here every day.''

   Why did dinosaurs disappear? Scientists
wrote 2,000 studies blaming asteroids, volcanoes, slow climate
change or even constipation. Researchers said Tuesday they think
they found the smoking gun: a 110-mile-wide impact crater in
Mexico.
   But don't bet the 12-year-long debate is over.
   Earlier evidence suggests other asteroids or comets struck Earth
near Manson, Iowa, and in the Caribbean off Colombia or Cuba when
the dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago.
   Some scientists say certain basalt rock deposits around the
world suggest another object also smacked into the planet to help
trigger mass extinction.
   ``We think we have found the smoking gun, but there may be other
guns and maybe a firing squad,'' said Bill Boynton, of the
University of Arizona at Tucson.
   The latest theory came during the American Geophysical Union's
fall meeting. The convention of 4,400 Earth scientists leans
heavily toward the theory that killer asteroids sent dinosaurs to
oblivion.
   The idea is that an incoming 6-mile-wide asteroid or comet - or
a shower of them - smacked into the Earth with the force of 70
million one-megaton bombs, kicking debris into the atmosphere and
causing radical environmental damage that wiped out the dinosaurs
and up to 75 percent of all living species.
   Some researchers think the impacts blocked out sunlight, wiping
out food supplies. Others theorized, somewhat in jest, that changes
in vegetation upset the dinosaurs' diet, leaving them fatally
constipated.
   Other possible deadly effects of asteroids hitting Earth include
acid rain, giant tidal waves, dark freezing weather, global warming
by the greenhouse effect and worldwide forest fires, said geologist
Walter Alvarez of the University of California at Berkeley, who
helped start the debate in 1978.
   Jay Melosh of the University of Arizona said worldwide soot
deposits support the fire theory. He believes a single asteroid
plowed into the Earth and sent molten rock droplets skyward, where
they heated the atmosphere and caused 700-degree surface
temperatures.
   ``It's enough heat to ignite vegetation,'' Melosh said.
``Unprotected animals would have been broiled in their tracks.''
   Alvarez, his father - the late Nobel Laureate physicist Luis W.
Alvarez - and others found deposits of 65-million-year-old iridium
metal in rocks around the world. Iridium is rare on Earth but less
rare in asteroids and comets. The killer-asteroid theory was born
because an impact would have spread iridium dust around the globe.
   Some researchers still argue the dinosaurs were rendered extinct
by gradual, natural climate changes or by climate disruption from
huge volcanic eruptions. They demanded asteroid advocates show
where the object or objects hit Earth.
   The 22-mile-wide crater in Iowa was created by an impact that
probably wasn't large enough to cause mass extinction, Alvarez
said.
   Last May, Alan Hildebrand, Boynton and others in Arizona
proposed one culprit impact crater in the Caribbean off Colombia's
coast. As evidence, they cited rock deposits in Haiti and the U.S.
Gulf coast caused by asteroid-induced rock fallout and 3-mile-high
tidal waves.
   In their latest study, presented by Boynton, they propose
another asteroid struck shallow Mexican waters. The impact site is
a 110-mile-wide crater now covered by sediment on the coast of
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula near the town of Chicxulub. The crater
contains once-melted rock and shocked quartz grains that indicate
something jolted the shallow sea floor.
   Boynton called the site ``ground zero'' but said another
asteroid probably hit offshore from Columbia. Others say there was
in impact near Cuba.
   Brown University's Peter Schultz said laboratory studies show a
single 6-mile-wide asteroid hitting Earth at a 15-degree angle
could have broken into 1,000 smaller pieces that caused a series of
impact craters.
   Alvarez said there also must be other impacts because some
debris found in worldwide rock deposits contains tiny balls of
basalt glass that couldn't have come from an asteroid smacking into
Iowa or the Yucatan.
   Alvarez said the debate is so important it has generated 2,000
studies since 1978.
   ``We wouldn't be here if it hadn't been for the extinction of
the dinosaurs,'' Alvarez said. ``They were ruling the place.
Mammals were just running around underfoot until the impact killed
the dinosaurs and let us evolve.''
   But if a huge asteroid impact happened today, it would cause the
extinction of the human race, said Ronald Prinn, of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<HEAD>Prosecutors to Seek Murder Indictment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities will seek a murder indictment
in the 1982 death of a woman who was struck by a stray bullet
during an alleged drug-war shootout, a prosecutor said.
   The slaying of Dennison University student Laura Carter was the
inspiration for the popular song ``Think of Laura'' by Christopher
Cross.
   James W. Smith, 52, had been charged with complicity and
conspiracy to commit murder, but those charges were dropped Monday.
   Doug Stead, assistant Franklin county prosecutor, said he and
another assistant prosecutor decided to seek an indictment on the
more severe charge of murder. They dismissed the conspiracy charge
because Smith cannot be charged twice for the same crime, he said.
   Common Pleas Judge Michael Close ordered the complicity charge
dropped because it wasn't filed within six years, the statute of
limitations.
   Smith was arrested in 1988 on the conspiracy charge. He was
released from jail and failed to appear for trial. He later was
indicted on the complicity charge.
   Ms. Carter, an 18-year-old student from Wayne, Pa., was riding
in a car with her father on a Columbus street when she was shot
April 17, 1982.
   Police believe that Smith and three other men were trying to
kill two members of a rival drug gang when a stray bullet struck
Ms. Carter. Smith's gang was upset over the other gang's efforts to
move in on the city's drug trade, according to court documents.
   Gordon C. Newlin and Norman Whiteside, two of the three men who
allegedly were with Smith, have been sentenced to prison terms of
seven to 25 years for conspiracy to commit aggravated murder.
   Another defendant, Paul Newlin, is charged with aggravated
murder, involuntary manslaughter, conspiracy to commit aggravated
murder and felonious assault.

   As Charles H. Keating's savings and loan
hurtled toward failure, two of the Keating Five senators pushed
hard for a sale rather than a government takeover of the
institution, a former chief S&amp;L regulator testified Tuesday.
   M. Danny Wall told Senate Ethics Committee hearings that Sen.
Alan Cranston contacted him four times and Sen. Dennis DeConcini at
least twice to urge that regulators not seize Lincoln Savings and
Loan.
   Wall focused on activities of Cranston and DeConcini from the
beginning of January through mid-April 1989 - a hectic period when
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board considered and rejected three
proposed sales of Lincoln. Regulators took over the Keating-owned,
Irvine, Calif., thrift that April 14.
   The former regulator said Cranston told him that day,
``something to the effect'' that ``I think the board has made a
mistake - I hope you are right.''
   Two years before the seizure, regulators told Cranston,
D-Calif., DeConcini, D-Ariz. and three other senators that criminal
referrals on Lincoln were being forwarded to the Justice
Department. Testimony in the hearings has shown that only the two
senators contacted the bank board after that.
   The three other senators whose conduct is being investigated by
the Ethics Committee are Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; John Glenn,
D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz.
   The committee is in its 11th day of hearings to determine
whether the five senators improperly intervened for Keating with
banking regulators in return for $1.3 million he and associates
donated to theircampaigns and causes.
   DeConcini and Cranston said they contacted Wall about a sale
because they were trying to save jobs at the thrift and at its
parent company, American Continental Corp., which is based in
Phoenix.
   Wall said that Cranston ``urged the board to give prompt
consideration and approval to any legitimate proposals'' for the
sale of Lincoln. DeConcini, he testified, sought ``prompt
consideration but did not state that a particular proposal be
accepted.''
   Wall said all three offers were rejected by the bank board or
its staff because Keating was not entirely separated from the
buyers and it appeared the new Lincoln would not be able to survive
economically.
   The former regulator, now a private financial consultant, said,
``I don't recall any discussion where details were discussed'' with
the senators.
   Wall said Cranston called him three times and they met April 7,
1989, just a week before the takeover. DeConcini called April 7 and
again on April 11, Wall said, and added there may have been a third
contact with the Arizonan not reflected in his records.
   In a sworn statement to the committee, Wall said on Nov. 7, ``I
have stated many times that my decisions regarding Lincoln were not
influenced by Mr. Keating, Sen. Cranston or Sen. DeConcini.''
   Wall responded ``no'' when Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., asked if
any of the senators pressured him to act in a particular way. In
his Nov. 7 statement, Wall said the large number of calls by
Cranston between 1987 and 1989 was unusual, but not improper.
   Wall, who formerly worked for Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, was asked
whether his former boss would have made the number of calls that
Cranston did to regulators.
   ``Sen. Garn wouldn't have done it. Others certainly do,'' he
testified.
   During the same January to April period, Keating was pushing
hard for approval of a sale. Wall quoted Keating as asking for an
appointment in January 1989 to discuss a subject that was -
according to Keating - the ``culmination of my life, maybe my
fortune.''
   When the meeting took place on Jan. 17, Wall said, Keating
indicated he was trying to sell Lincoln and that it ``was not wise
for him to get into a regulated business. He wanted to get out of
the business.''
   Cranston told the committee, according to the transcript of his
closed-door testimony on May 17, that he never inquired about
details of the proposed sales.
   ``All I wanted them (the bank board members) to do was to make
sure they didn't block a sale just because they were down on
Keating and wanted - some people may have wanted to drive him out
of business rather than let him sell his way out of the business.''
   Cranston didn't identify the subjects of his remarks, but has
been highly critical of Wall's predecessor as bank board chairman,
Edwin J. Gray. Gray has been the chief accuser of the five
senators, saying they improperly intervened with him on Keating's
behalf. Keating has said Gray was prejudiced against Lincoln.

   An ambitious effort to overhaul the
world trading system appeared on the verge of collapse Tuesday as
pressure built on European countries to compromise in their fight
against major farm subsidy cuts.
   Some European officials indicated they were willing to offer
more agriculture subsidy cuts, although it was uncertain whether
any new offer would be enough to satisfy U.S. negotiators.
   The 12-nation European Community had staunchly resisted a
U.S.-backed proposal to slash export subsidies by 90 percent and
reduce internal support payments and market barriers by 75 percent
over the next decade.
   Many Third World countries viewed lower farm barriers as their
No. 1 priority in the discussions.
   The talks, known as the Uruguay Round since they began in 1986
in the South American nation, seek to dismantle barriers to trade
in agricultural products, manufactured goods and the fast-growing
area of services, such as banking and insurance.
   ``We have a very large stalemate in agriculture and that is
unfortunate,'' said a disappointed U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills.
   Rufus Yerxa, one of Hills' top aides, said ``negotiations are
very close to collapse.''
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said even
if the farm issue is resolved, it was unlikely a final trade
agreement could be completed on schedule this week.
   He suggested another meeting would be necessary, possibly in
January with lower-level negotiators involved.
   A total of 107 nations are participating in the discussions,
which had been scheduled to wrap up with five days of marathon
bargaining this week at the Heysel Palaces, a vast exhibition
complex on the outskirts of Brussels.
   Facing the prospect that these talks could fail, officials from
Germany said Tuesday they were now campaigning with EC members for
more flexibility on agriculture subsididies.
   Germany's change of position, just two days after national
elections, could represent a significant breakthrough. The Germans
had been one of the major opponents of farm subsidy cuts.
   But there was no indication that France and Ireland, two other
strong supporters of the subsidies, had softened their position.
   Assistant German Economics Minister Lorenz Schomerus did not
give any details on what level of subsidy cuts the Germans would
support.
   At present, the EC is offering what would amount to a 15 percent
reduction in internal price supports.
   Other members of the EC include: Belgium, Denmark, Greece,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Britain, Spain and Portugal.
   U.S. officials held out hope that a meeting in Paris on
Wednesday between German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French
President Francois Mitterrand might produce a change in France's
opposition as well.
   The meeting was officially called to discuss next week's summit
of European Community leaders in Rome, but it was likely the two
leaders would take up the farm question.
   The Bush administration has estimated a successful trade
agreement would help reduce America's huge trade deficits, still
running at nearly $100 billion a year, by boosting export
opportunities for U.S. farmers and businesses.
   President Bush, who is on a trip to South America, said
Wednesday, ``We must use this meeting to find the political will to
limit or reduce distortions in trade.''
   Bush in the past has lobbied other heads of state to support the
talks, which the administration has made its top trade priority.
   However, U.S. negotiators have found little progress in the
first two days of talks in Brussels.
   ``For all practical purposes, two days of negotiations here in
Brussels have been wasted in so far as agriculture is concerned and
there are not that many days left,'' said Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter.
   Negotiators in the other 14 areas of the talks also reported
little progress.
   ``I have seen no real movements from entrenched positions in any
of the major areas,'' Uruguayan Foreign Minister Hector Gros
Espiell, the chairman of the trade talks, said Tuesday night. ``I
feel that we need substantial breakthroughs ... if this meeting is
to end with a package of results truly meaningful for all
participants.''

<TEXT>
   The leader of the major opposition
coalition of anti-Communists acknowledged on Tuesday that he had
worked as a police informer under the discredited former hard-line
Marxist regime.
   Peter Beron, chief of the 16-party Union of Democratic Forces,
was reacting to charges earlier Tuesday that he and 70 other
parliamentarians collaborated with the police under the toppled
Communist leadership. Beron had said Monday that he wanted to
return to work as a zoologist and planned to leave politics.
   On Tuesday, Beron told state radio he informed on foreign
visitors to the Museum of Natural History while in charge of the
museum's international relations department during the 1980s.
   But he denied working for the Sixth Department, the feared
political police section that spied on Bulgarians seen as a threat
to the Communist leadership. He said his activities were ``normal
practice in every normal state.''
   ``I never was a member of the Communist Party, unlike many who
now accuse me,'' Beron said, alluding to former Marxists who went
over to the opposition in the last year, after Bulgaria's Communist
dictatorship crumbled.
   Beron spoke from Budapest, Hungary, en route to Bulgaria. He
insisted that his police activities served the state and not the
Communist Party.
   Hours after union leader Konstantin Trenchev leveled his
accusations, Parliament voted overwhelmingly to ask the Interior
Ministry to hand over files to a special legislative committee
within a week on all legislators who had worked with the secret
police.
   Socialist Premier Andrei Lukanov and his government of former
Communists were toppled last Friday by a UDF boycott of the
legislature, prolonged street demonstrations and a general strike
called by the Podkrepa trade union federation. Lukanov's
administration came under fire largely because of its links with
the former Communist system. The Communists changed their name to
the Bulgarian Socialist Party after the old regime fell.
   The former Communists won June elections but saw their
popularity fade as economic troubles mounted. Bulgaria now rations
basic foods and energy.
   The Socialists are negotiating the makeup of a new government
with the UDF.
   Trenchev, chairman of Podkrepa, said in an interview, ``Our
union has a list with 71 names of deputies who were employees of
the former secret police. These people must leave Parliament.''
   He said 54 of the deputies were Socialists and 17 were members
of the UDF, including Beron.
   The allegations were likely to split the opposition at a time
when it needs unity in its bid for a major share of power in a new
government, and to further polarize Parliament. That could make it
harder to approve economic reforms needed to bring Bulgaria out of
its worst post-World War II economic crisis.
   In separate comments, the state BTA news agency quoted Trenchev
as saying Beron ``has been an informer of ... the `thought police'
of the totalitarian regime.''
   Prominent members of the UDF refused to dismiss allegations of
further police informers in their ranks.
   ``I cannot exclude the possibility that a whole bunch of (our)
people were employees of the security police in the past and
continue in such functions even today,'' Alexander Yordanov said in
an interview.
   In such a case, ``the Communist Party remains in power in
Bulgaria and the system remains totalitarian,'' he said.
   Unlike other East bloc countries, where Communists were ousted
by popular pressure, reformist Communists toppled Bulgaria's
longtime Communist strongman Todor Zhivkov in November 1989.
   The former Communists - now Socialists - are widely considered
the heirs of a bankrupt Communist system that was based on police
state controls, a centralized economy and dependence on Moscow.

   Walter Hickel was sworn in as Alaska's
first independent governor, declaring ``a new day for this great
land'' and promising to protect the resource-rich state from
outside interests.
   ``Alaskans are truly independent, regardless of political
party,'' Hickel said at Monday's ceremony. ``And we're not awed by
outside interests, however big they are or think they are.''
   Hickel returned to the governor's mansion 22 years after he quit
halfway through his first term to become U.S. interior secretary
under President Nixon. He succeeds Democrat Steve Cowper, who did
not seek re-election to a second term.
   At 71, Hickel is the oldest governor in the state's 32-year
history.
   During his campaign and again Monday, Hickel appealed to
Alaskans' historic sense that they have too little control over the
state's vast resource wealth. He promised to take a tough stand in
dealing with outside business interests, environmental groups and
Congress.
   ``We will not tolerate those who would take advantage of
Alaska's people or abuse our beautiful state,'' he said. ``We're
going to insist that they play by our rules.''
   Although a lifelong Republican, Hickel ran on the Alaskan
Independence Party ticket after that party's primary winner dropped
out in September.
   He was elected in November.

<TEXT>
   Congress should limit funding of the Navy's
$48.7 billion Seawolf attack submarine, which is plagued by
financial and technical problems rooted in its computer system, a
House committee report says.
   The vessel is ``perhaps the most conspicuous and potentially
most costly example of a program struggling with the problems of
adapting state-of-the-art computer technology into a
multibillion-dollar weapons platform,'' the Government Operations
Committee said in its report, scheduled for release Wednesday.
   It recommends that Congress limit funding for construction of
additional Seawolf submarines until the Pentagon clarifies the
program's mission and provides assurances that the computer
problems will be fixed.
   Spokesman Lt. Greg Smith said the Navy would have no immediate
comment.
   Pentagon plans call for building 29 of the ships for $48.7
billion, with the first scheduled for completion in 1995. The
Seawolf is billed as the largest, quietest and most heavily armed
nuclear attack submarines.
   A key component of the Seawolf is its BSY-2 computerized combat
system. General Electric is under contract to develop three of the
systems.
   The report said testimony at committee hearings revealed that
more than 800 people will be needed to develop the software
programs for the Seawolf and integrate an estimated 3.2 million
lines of code. The contractor, the report said, was having trouble
finding qualified workers for the task.
   The Navy has a ``dismal'' track record on combat computer system
acquisition, the report said. It said the policy was based on a
``buy now, fix later'' philosophy under which the Navy purchases
components before all the problems are worked out.
   The Navy is developing BSY-2 separately from the rest of the
Seawolf on the premise that the combat system will be ready for
installation when the rest of the submarine is completed, said
Government Operations chairman John Conyers, D-Mich.
   ``This did not work with previous class submarines and there is
no reason to believe it will work now,'' he said.

   Madonna, a master at making videos that generate
almost as much controversy as they do record sales, wants to know
why violence is acceptable for television and steamy sex scenes are
not.
   Madonna appeared on ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' early Tuesday in an
interview just after the news program aired her too-hot-for-MTV
video ``Justify My Love'' in its entirety.
   The video, rejected by MTV last week, features the
bra-and-garter-belt-clad singer in an encounter with a lover,
played by her real-life boyfriend, Tony Ward, in a Paris hotel.
   The video is intended to portray the couple's fantasies, which
run to bisexuality, voyeurism, group sex, cross-dressing and mild
sadomasochism.
   She told interviewer Forrest Sawyer via satellite from Los
Angeles that the video - with its chains, black leather and
crucifixes - was about ``honesty ... and the celebration of sex.
There's nothing wrong with that.''
   But she said she thought there was a double standard at work on
television.
   ``Why are we willing to deal with the reality of violence and
sexism and why aren't we willing to deal with sexuality?'' she
asked.
   The appearance got the show its highest overnight ratings this
year, ABC said Tuesday.
   The 30-minute show averaged a 10.2 rating in overnight A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings from 25 cities. Those ratings represent nearly
half of the nation's 93.1 million TV households.
   The program's national ratings won't be in until next week, but
ABC projects that they also will be the highest this year for
``Nightline,'' said spokeswoman Laura Wessner.
   Monday's show was preceded by ABC's telecast of the San
Francisco 49ers-New York Giants' football game, which very likely
helped the ``Nightline'' ratings by giving the show a big lead-in
audience, Wessner said.
   Monday's ``Nightline'' marked the first time a major network had
run Madonna's much-publicized video without first censoring parts
of it. But the video's first uncensored national telecast was
Thursday, when it was shown on The Jukebox Network, an interactive
cable network.
   Despite the appearance of Madonna and her video on
``Nightline,'' the show's ratings champion probably will remain Ted
Koppel's May 27, 1987, interview of fallen TV evangelist Jim Bakker
and Bakker's wife, Tammy.
   That one-hour special broadcast averaged an 11.4 national
rating. A ratings point in 1987 represented 87.4 million homes.

   For years pharmacist Edward Kilkeary used
arthritis medication, saline solution and sterilizing equipment to
whip up hundreds of tiny bottles of specially prescribed eye drops
for cataract patients.
   But sometime this year something went wrong.
   Two women last month each lost an eye to a virulent bacteria. At
least 10 people were hospitalized with infections, and countless
others sought help for swelling and burning caused by a toxin that
was eating away their eyes.
   The bacteria, pseudomonas, contaminated an unknown number of
bottles that were sold under the name Indocin to patients who had
recently undergone cataract surgery. The infection puzzled doctors
who treated the patients, and the drops were traced to Hieber's
Drug Store, where Kilkeary manufactured them.
   ``A pharmacy is a place where people put their trust, like their
docs, like their priests,'' said Dr. Robert Lewen of Allegheny
General Hospital, where eight people were treated. ``When that
trust is violated, I think people seem to be somewhat resentful.
This was not supposed to be the way things work.''
   State and federal agencies investigated, but answers have been
hampered by poor records, the sale of the drug to other pharmacies
and doctors, and conflicting information from Kilkeary, said Ron
Howard of the state Health Department.
   Kilkeary has refused to be interviewed.
   District Attorney Robert Colville said Tuesday that
investigators lack hard evidence to warrant the filing of criminal
charges against Hieber's or Kilkeary because there is no proof of
``gross, wanton and willful disregard for the safety of others.''
   But Howard said he has ``one of the tightest cases'' he's seen
in 25 years and will try to pursue prosecution with other
authorities if Colville decides not to take it.
   ``There's more than one way of handling legal action,'' Howard's
boss, Jack Ogun, director of the Health Department's Bureau of
Drugs, Devices and Cosmetics, said Tuesday.
   Colville characterized the evidence as technical violations,
which he called ``bureaucratic nitpicking.''
   ``It's selective enforcement, looking at somebody after the
fact,'' he said. ``If they had been enforcing these regulations and
Hieber's failed to comply, I'd say fine. But there's no evidence
they did that. That kind of enforcement the court looks at with a
jaundiced eye.''
   The patients who experienced the worst problems ranged in age
from 55 to 78 and took the drops after undergoing cataract surgery
when their wounds were fresh, giving the bacteria access to
sensitive tissues.
   Two women had to have their eyes removed because of irreversible
infections from the drops, Lewen said.
   ``Their eyes were blind, painful and cosmetically unacceptable -
ugly, red and draining. The pain was as unrelenting as toothache
pain,'' Lewen said. He also said there was a small risk the
infection could spread to the brain.
   Indocin is an anti-inflammatory drug produced by Merck, Sharp &amp;
Dohme for pain caused by diseases such as arthritis. At least 15
Pittsburgh-area doctors have legally prescribed it to reduce
swelling after eye surgery, Howard said.
   Indocin has not been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for use as eye drops, but such use is not illegal.
   Hieber's is believed to be the only pharmacy in the area that
manufactures the drops, which are sold in half-ounce bottles for
about $15.
   Howard said Kilkeary made up to 2,000 bottles a year and either
sold the medication outright to patients with prescriptions or for
resale to doctors and other pharmacies in violation of state
pharmaceutical regulations.
   Because Kilkeary wasn't registered as a drug manufacturer, there
was no inspection of his facilities and methods, which Howard
called ``extremely primitive.''
   He said Kilkeary used an autoclave - a pressurized vessel used
for sterilization - but couldn't answer questions about the amount
of heat or pressure applied to kill bacteria.
   Recent eye surgery patients with Indocin eye drops, or drops
that contain the generic ingredient indomethacin, have been warned
not to use them.
   Henry Henrich, a 65-year-old from McKeesport who was treated for
infection in one eye, has sued for $20,000, and more lawsuits are
anticipated.
   ``You have a guy making moonshine in the back yard and selling
it as medicine,'' said his attorney, Samuel Cordes. ``The methods
they were using are so primitive that it's kind of surprising it
hasn't happened before.''

   Iran said 27 members of a drug
trafficking gang were hanged in the western city of Bakhtaran on
Tuesday, the same day a U.N. committee adopted a resolution calling
on Tehran to end human rights abuses.
   The traffickers executed at Dizelabad prison had been involved
in buying and selling narcotics in Bakhtaran and Zahedan, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency said in a two-paragraph
report monitored in Nicosia.
   The People's Mujahedeen of Iran, an exile group dedicated to
toppling Iran's government, has claimed the government sometimes
disguises executions of dissidents by claiming they are drug
dealers.
   The U.N. resolution, a compromise version that deleted draft
language criticizing ``executions, ill-treatment and torture'' in
Iran, came as Amnesty International accused Tehran of perpetrating
a wave of political executions.
   The General Assembly subcommittee dealing with human rights
dropped that language so Tehran would continue cooperating with
U.N. human rights investigations and let the Red Cross visit its
prisons.

   The U.S. and Canadian governments bungled the
probe of a crash that killed 256 American servicemen and may be
concealing a possible terrorist connection, a congressional panel
was told Tuesday.
   Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C., told the House Judiciary subcommittee
on crime that federal agencies appear to be guilty of ``ineptness
or the best-contrived cover-up ... ever'' in the Dec. 12, 1985,
crash in Gander, Newfoundland.
   The DC-8 carrying U.S. peacekeeping troops home from the Middle
East crashed less than 30 seconds after takeoff.
   ``Incredibly, no U.S. government agency, or at least none with
official responsibility, demonstrated any determination to find out
just what caused the crash,'' said subcommittee Chairman William
Hughes, D-N.J.
   ``The National Transportation Safety Board, and other agencies
of the U.S. government, chose to sit back and watch as the Canadian
efforts became embroiled in controversy,'' Hughes said. ``The NTSB
routinely rubber-stamped the Canadian findings.''
   The Canadian investigation attributed the probable cause of the
crash to ice on the wings of the chartered military jet.
   A subcommittee staff report that formed the basis for Tuesday's
hearing said there was no evidence that either the United States or
Canada had seriously investigated possible terrorism.
   Eyewitnesses say they saw a bright orange object in the sky at
the time of the crash, suggesting the plane was on fire.
   An anonymous caller later said that Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian
terrorist group, had put a bomb on the plane.
   ``When a terrorist organization took credit for this
abomination, why was this claim not investigated and a report made
to the American people?'' asked retired Army Col. Lewis Millett.
   Millett, a Medal of Honor winner, wiped his eyes as he spoke of
his son, a soldier in the Army's 101st Airborne Division who died
in the crash.
   The theory of ice on the wings is ``preposterous,'' said L.T.
Filotas, a Canadian aeronautical engineer who served on the
investigating panel and dissented from the majority's finding.
   Filotas said the five-member majority of the Canadian board
refused to set aside the ice theory long enough to investigate
other possibilities.
   Tallon and others suggest the plane might have been blown up by
terrorists in connection with the Iran-Contra affair. The Reagan
administration authorized a shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran less
than three weeks before the plane crashed.
   The missiles weren't the kind the Iranians were expecting and
the Iranians felt they had been duped, according to computer
messages from former White House aide Oliver North. The messages
were uncovered by the Iran-Contra committees.
   In retaliation, terrorists might have planted an explosive
device aboard the plane, said Dr. J.D. Phillips, a pathologist
whose only son was killed in the crash.
   The man who piloted the plane on the first leg of its journey to
Cairo, Egypt, told the FBI he believed it experienced structural
failure or that a bomb exploded on takeoff. The pilot also told the
FBI that the Egyptian Army guard assigned to the plane while it was
on the ground disappeared from his post several times.
   The FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ``found very
serious allegations'' but that information apparently wasn't turned
over to the Canadian panel investigating the crash, Tallon said.
   The FBI said it has no reason to question the accuracy of the
Canadian findings.
   ``No credible evidence has surfaced'' suggesting the charter
flight by Miami-based Arrow Air crashed was the result of an act of
terrorism, Nicholas O'Hara, deputy assistant director for criminal
investigations at the FBI, said in prepared testimony.
   Arrow Air was one of the subcontractors that hauled weapons to
the Contras for Oliver North's secret resupply network. It operated
in 1985 and 1986 during a congressional ban on U.S. military aid to
the rebel force.

   Dark-horse presidential candidate
Stanislaw Tyminski on Tuesday led miners in chants of ``Down With
Walesa'' in a return to one of his bases of support. The rally,
however, was frequently disrupted by hecklers.
   Tyminski, an emigre businessman who returned to Poland after 21
years, made a home-stretch campaign trip into the mining region of
Silesia, where he did well in the first round of voting Nov. 25.
   Tyminski said Solidarity leader Lech Walesa ``is finished,''
despite polls that show Walesa ahead by a 2-1 margin for Sunday's
runoff election to pick Poland's first popularly chosen president.
   But Tyminski said his own polls put Walesa's support at 50
percent and his at 44 percent and growing.
   The 90-minute rally before about 3,000 people turned tense when
about 500 Walesa supporters began to jeer Tyminski, who placed
second in the first-round voting. There were shouting matches
between the camps and several fistfights.
   Tuesday was the feast of St. Barbara, patron saint of miners,
and was a holiday. Many of the miners were drinking before the
rally in Jastrzebie, about 225 miles south of Warsaw.
   ``We are millions,'' Tyminski said shortly after arriving on
stage to a din of boos and cheers. ``Now a new decade begins, and
this decade belongs to us.''
   After being interrupted by chants of ``KGB'' and ``Back to
Peru,'' Tyminski, his Peruvian-born wife, Graciela, and their
supporters responded with, ``Down with Walesa.''
   ``I think he can hear it in Gdansk,'' Tyminski said, referring
to the birthplace of Solidarity. ``Let him feel our power, like we
could feel his power for the past 10 years.''
   ``How much hatred there is for Walesa in our country,'' he said.
``Especially here in Silesia. Why didn't he come here?''
   Tyminski claimed he turned down an invitation Tuesday night to
meet with U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who is visiting
Poland.
   A U.S. source confirmed Tyminski was on the guest list for an
embassy reception for Cheney, but said there was no meeting
planned. Cheney is traveling to Gdansk on Wednesday to see Walesa.
   Tyminski has promised to quickly improve Poland's economy and
has blamed many of its problems on Walesa and Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who was eliminated from the presidential race
by placing third in the first round.
   But Tyminski has also been criticized for his leadership of the
fringe Libertarian Party of Canada, his advocacy of nuclear
weapons, his long absence from his country and his reported use of
hallucinogens while living in an Amazonian river city in Peru in
the early 1980s. He denied any use of drugs Tuesday.
   Tyminski supporters at the rally called Walesa a traitor. Under
the Communists, miners were treated as a royalty among workers,
earning twice the national average. Now many fear for their jobs as
money-losing mines face closure or bankruptcy.
   Fifty-eight coal mines are losing money or cannot pay taxes this
year, while 12 will show a profit, the government reported Tuesday.
   ``Walesa betrayed us ... He has no support in Silesia,'' said
miner Mieczyslaw Kupko, who got Tyminski to autograph a copy of his
self-published book of political thoughts titled, ``Sacred Dogs.''
   ``Walesa is so fat because he grows on miners' money,'' agreed
Legina Sadej. ``Tyminski can give us more.''
   But the Solidarity leader also had loyalists in the hall, who
believe Tyminski has ties to the Communist Party deposed from power
by Solidarity in 1989.
   ``We have to save Poland against Tyminski,'' said Emilia
Bargiel. She said she was ashamed that she voted for Tyminski in
the first round.
   ``Nobody knew the truth about Tyminski, but finally the
journalists found out - too late for many people,'' she said,
referring to reports that former Communists and secret police are
aiding Tyminski's bid.
   Earlier Tuesday, Tyminski charged there were secret police
agents among prominent Solidarity activists.
   Tyminski repeated that he is a practicing Roman Catholic - 93
percent of Poles consider themselves Catholics - and said it would
be up to the church to judge his decision to divorce and have
children out of wedlock.
   Cardinal Jozef Glemp, leader of Poland's Roman Catholic Church,
has urged followers to vote for Walesa, one newspaper reported
Tuesday.
   Of the election, Walesa said in a radio talk show, ``I don't
believe Mr. Tyminski has a chance. But he was needed as a lesson in
democracy.''

<TEXT>
   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos on
Tuesday told his party its political monopoly will soon end and
said it must abandon Marxist economics to embrace the free market
and democratic socialism.
   Dos Santos was unanimously re-elected president of the Popular
Movement for the Liberation of Angola at its third congress, but
faces resistance to his reform plans from MPLA hard-liners. The
six-day congress opened Tuesday and is scheduled to debate
proposals for reforming the centralized economy and introducing
multiparty democracy.
   The 700 delegates will also discuss the continuing peace talks
with U.S.-backed UNITA rebels to end a 15-year-old civil war that
has devastated what is potentially one of Africa's richest
economies.
   Dos Santos told delegates this congress may be ``the last under
a single-party system.''
   His half-hour speech was interrupted by frequent applause.
   The president criticized the centrally planned economic system
followed by the MPLA since Angola's independence from Portugal in
1975.
   ``The inadequacy of the system is showing in an economic
asphyxiation because of the high level of collectivism of the means
of production and services,'' he said.
   He also said political advances will be difficult while the war
continues with UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola.
   Portuguese government mediators said after a fifth round of
peace talks between the two sides last month that they were close
to a cease-fire. Talks are expected to resume next month.
   Gen. Juliao Mateus Paulo, deputy chief of staff of the Angolan
armed forces, criticized the United States for its continued
support of UNITA rebels.
   He told the congress on Tuesday that the Bush administration
``appears to be trying to take advantage of the new (international)
situation by promoting instability in countries like Angola.''
   In October, Congress passed an administration proposal for a $60
million U.S. military aid package to the rebels.
   It approved an amendment saying part of the aid may be suspended
if Angola's government carries out its pledge to introduce a
pluralist system and halts arms purchases from the Soviet Union.
   U.S. and Soviet observers have attended the peace talks in
Portugal.
   Mateus Paulo is new chairman of a commission to overhaul the
southern African state's constitution in preparation for multiparty
democracy. He told deputies the armed forces' role will be
radically altered in Angola's shift from one-party rule.
   Removing existing close links between the MPLA and the army and
integrating government forces with UNITA guerrillas are among the
toughest issues on the agenda of the peace talks.
   Dos Santos said Tuesday political advances will be difficult
while the war continues with UNITA, the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola.
   He has said plans to introduce a multiparty system will go ahead
early next year, even without an agreement with the rebels.
   Angola is rich in minerals and agricultural land, but the war
has crippled economic activity and severed communications. Only
exports from the heavily guarded northwestern oil fields have kept
the economy afloat.

   House Democrats, on a vote of 177-37, adopted
a policy statement late Tuesday which declared President Bush
should take no military action against Iraq without prior approval
from Congress, ``except to protect American lives from imminent
endangerment.''
   The Democratic caucus debated the non-binding declaration for
two hours, amending it in the end to include language supporting
the president's diplomatic initiatives in the Gulf crisis. But the
admonition to Bush to seek congressional approval for making war
``is a statement by the Democratic Caucus that we want the
Constitution respected on this crucial point,'' said Rep. Norman
Lent, D-Wash.
   Earlier, former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara testified
to a Senate committee that prior approval from Congress and the
public for making war against Iraq should be a lesson heeded from
Vietnam. And a Republican senator agreed that ``If we start having
body bags coming back, we will have a very serious revolt'' if the
president orders Americans into combat without that approval.
   McNamara, who was Lyndon B. Johnson's defense secretary at the
height of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee the administration should continue to rely upon
economic sanctions as the main weapon against Iraq for a year or
more.
   In Uruguay, Bush took issue with the parade of congressional
witnesses who have argued for patience with the sanctions strategy.
``I've not been one whose been convinced that sanctions alone will
bring him to his senses,'' Bush said of Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein.
   Two other former Pentagon leaders, Gen. David Jones and Adm.
William Crowe, had suggested earlier that Bush give the sanctions
up to 18 months to work. As to that, Bush said ``I don't agree with
them. ``I can't say how long, but I don't agree with them.''
   McNamara, meanwhile, asked the Senate committee: ``Who can doubt
that a year of blockade will be cheaper than a week of war?''
   Asked to compare the situation with Vietnam, McNamara said: ``I
do not believe the president should - and I do not believe he will
- initiate action without the approval of the American people
expressed by the approval of the Congress.''
   Several committee members, meanwhile, indicated they had not
been swayed by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's argument to the
Senate Armed Services Committee a day earlier that the
international sanctions against Iraq were likely to prove futile.
   ``Sometimes there is more toughness in patience than in lashing
out. This is such a time,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., a member
of the foreign relations panel.
   Republican Sen. Larry Pressler of South Dakota said Americans
want peace. ``If we start having body bags come back, we will have
a very serious revolt in terms of public opinion,'' he warned.
   And Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., added: ``We have time.
I don't see any hurry. I don't see any doubt that he either gets
out, or he gets thrown out, blown out.''
   Across the Capitol, House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin,
D-Wis., opened yet another Gulf policy hearing - set to last three
weeks - by observing ``The country is united on ends but divided on
means.''
   Aspin, who has supported Bush's latest troop deployments, agreed
that ``action that isn't backed by consensus will mean disaster.
Whatever we do, the country, the Congress and the president must do
it standing on common ground.''
   The House panel heard Jerrold M. Post, founder of the CIA's
Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior, say
that Saddam is a ``judicious political calculator, who is by no
means irrational, but is dangerous to the extreme.''
   Post, now a professor at George Washington University, said ``It
is this political personality constellation - meassianic ambition
for unlimited power, absence of conscience, unconstrained
aggression and a paranoid outlook - which make Saddam so
dangerous.''
   In making his argument for sanctions, Moynihan said Iraq relies
on imports for items as basic as its own currency. Holding up
several Iraqi dinars, he noted that they are printed in London, and
wear out in about 12 months.
   Later, speaking with reporters, Moynihan observed that Bush had
enjoyed unstinting congressional support until Nov. 8, when the
administration announced a new troop buildup to achieve an
offensive capability. Since then, Democrats have urged Bush to rely
more on sanctions and diplomacy than on military force.
   But Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., agreed with Cheney's
conclusion that a promise of time to let the sanctions work also
amounted to a reprieve in pressure on Iraq that would let Saddam
husband resources and build military strength.
   ``If he is able to hold off the entire world for two years,
Saddam Hussein will be seen as the new Nasser of the Middle East,''
Boschwitz said, in a reference to the Egyptian Arab leader of the
1960s.
   But McNamara said those who focus on the costs of a prolonged
embargo fail to see the costs of immediate military action.
   ``If we carry on sanctions for 12 to 18 months, there's no
question we risk fracturing the unity of the international
coalition'' lined up against Iraq, he said.
   ``But I can tell you, it's hardly a risk - it's almost a
certainty - that if we undertake military action there will be a
fracture of the unity ...
   ``There are divisive forces in the Arab world. They are going to
be fed by the initiation of military action that is going to appear
to many in the Arab world to be the unilateral action of the United
States... . It is a far lesser risk than the loss of thousands of
American lives.''

   President Bush on Tuesday rejected
recommendations from former Pentagon chiefs to give sanctions
against Iraq at least a year to work. A Uruguayan leader urged Bush
to have ``infinite patience'' before resorting to military force.
   Bush, on the second day of a salute-to-democracy tour across
South America, said he was not convinced ``sanctions alone would
bring (Iraq's Saddam Hussein) to his senses.''
   Oil prices driven up by the gulf crisis have devastated many
countries economies, he said, vowing, ``This is not going to go on
forever.''
   Back in Washington, House Democrats voted 177-37 in caucus for a
non-binding resolution telling Bush he must first get permission
from Congress before sending troops into battle.
   Former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara added his voice to
the witnesses before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee urging
caution in the U.S.-led effort to force Iraq to relinquish its hold
on Kuwait.
   ``Who can doubt that a year of blockade will be cheaper than a
week of war?'' asked McNamara, who led the U.S. military buildup in
Vietnam.
   Even in Montevideo, restraint was urged upon Bush. Uruguay's
vice president exhorted Bush to exercise ``infinite patient in
making a judgment'' in the gulf crisis.
   ``If the decision is for war, perhaps we will not justify it but
we will certainly understand it,'' said Gonzalo Aguirre in
introducing Bush to the Uruguay's Congress. Several lefist deputies
and senators boycotted the speech and 400 demonstrators protested
outside.
   Bush, at an earlier news conference with President Luis Alberto
Lacalle, said Saddam ``has not gotten the message'' so far that he
must withdraw from Kuwait or he will be forced out.
   The United Nations resolution authorizing force against Iraq
unless it withdraws from Kuwait by Jan. 15 was ``loud and clear,''
Bush said. ``But I don't think Saddam Hussein yet understands
that.''
   ``The best hope for peace is for him to understand that all
means - all means - necessary to fulfill these resolutions will be
used against him,'' Bush said.
   The Persian Gulf crisis was at the top of his agenda as Bush
arrived here from Brazil on the second day of his week-long tour of
South America.
   The House Democrats' resolution states that he must get
congressional permission before taking offensive action in the gulf
``except to protect American lives from imminent endangerment.''
   McNamara testified that Bush should not act ``without the
approval of the American people expressed by the approval of the
Congress.''
   A Republican senator, Larry Pressler of South Dakota, concurred,
saying, ``If we start having body bags come back, we will have a
very serious revolt in terms of public opinion.''
   ``We have time. I don't see any hurry,'' said Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. ``Either (Saddam) gets out, or he gets
thrown out, blown out.''
   Bush firmly rejected suggestions from two former chairmen of the
joint chiefs - Gen. David Jones and Adm. William Crowe - that he
give sanctions against Iraq up to 18 months to work before
resorting to force. Senate Democrats also have urged Bush to stick
with the sanctions.
   ``I don't agree with them,'' Bush said. ``I can't say how long
(sanctions should be tested) but I don't agree with them.''
   Bush endorsed remarks Sunday by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, who said the United States would not attack Iraq if it
withdrew from Kuwait and complied with all U.N. peacemaking
resolutions. ``I did not have any problem with that at all,'' the
president said.
   Bush indicated he would take a tough stand when he meets at the
White House with Iraq's Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz on the gulf
crisis. He said he would not allow any linkage with the Palestinian
issue and Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``I'm not in a negotiating mood or anything of that nature when
I meet with Aziz,' Bush said.
   Bush said the sanctions have been costly to Uruguay, as well as
other countries, as oil prices climbed and export markets to Iraq
and Kuwait were closed.
   ``And yet you never flinched, your country never flinched, you
never wavered in support of these U.N. sanctions,'' Bush, the first
American president to visit Uruguay since Lyndon Johnson in 1967,
told the lawmakers.
   On Wednesday, Bush will head across the River Platte to Buenos
Aires, mopping up from a failed revolt within the Argentine
military.
   Bush said he did not view Monday's uprising as a sign that
democracy is fragile in Argentina. He said he would salute
President Carlos Menem for his leadership and economic reforms.
   Argentina has dispatched two warships to the Persian Gulf, the
only Latin nation to join the multinational force. OPEC-member
Venezuela, the last stop on Bush's trip, has stepped up oil
production to help fill the gap in world supplies.
   Bush opened his visit here by proclaiming ``a new era in
U.S.-Latin American relations.''
   ``We in the Americas are on the brink of something unprecedented
in world history - the first wholly democratic hemisphere,'' Bush
said.
   ``And in anticipation of that, we need to create together a
permanent partnership among all the nations of the Americas,'' he
said.
   Bush and Lacalle both spoke of the importance of lifting
barriers to international trade, including farm subsidies. Trade
talks are now in their final days in Brussels in the effort to
rewrite the global trading rules last forged in Uruguay in 1986.
   ``We are in the same boat in this GATT negotiations,'' said
Lacalle, who said protectionist barriers and subsidies have ``hurt
millions of people.''
   ``We foresee a whole hemisphere of much more open trade,'' said
Bush, who exhorted developing countries to ``move briskly to
privatization, to free markets'' in order to attract investments
and new technology.
   Bush said ``we are not locked on a specific figure'' on how
deeply farm subsidies should be cut. ``We are locked on the fact
that there has to be inclusion of all categories (of products).
   Bush and Lacalle later flew by helicopter to the ocean resort of
Punta del Este, 90 miles east of the capital, where Bush jogged on
the beach and took a dip in the Atlantic before dining with Lacalle
at a posh restaurant. Bush was spending the night in a luxurious
private beachfront home.
   After Argentina, Bush flies to Chile on Thursday and Venezuela
on Friday before heading home on Saturday.

<HEAD>Moonstruck High Tides Flood Northeast, Midwest Digs Out From
Blizzard</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Midwest dug out of a deadly blizzard that dumped up to 2
feet of snow and high tides caused flooding Tuesday along Lake Erie
and the New England Coast, forcing the evacuation of an office
complex and a school in Maine.
   Seaside communities from Connecticut to Maine were hit by
unusually high tides caused by a rare alignment of the moon, Earth
and sun and whipped still higher by gale-force winds.
   Most of the Midwest was recovering from Monday's snowstorm that
left at least nine people dead in Wisconsin, six in Iowa, and one
in western Pennsylvania. However, the storm didn't hit Indiana
until early Tuesday, causing at least four traffic fatalities as 4
inches of snow and 25 mph winds made driving treacherous in the
north-central part of the state.
   The National Weather Service said high tide averaged 2 feet
above normal Tuesday.
   Firefighters in Portland, Maine, evacuated about 100 people from
offices along Portland Pier, which was covered in 3 feet of water
by noon, said Capt. Lannie M. McGahey of the city Fire Department.
   ``We're kind of hoping the tide brings fresh fish in so we can
serve it on the menu tonight,'' said Cynthia Moran, the owner of
J's Oyster, a tavern doing brisk business among the office
evacuees.
   In neighboring Falmouth, about 45 students were evacuated from
the Governor Baxter School for the Deaf on Mackworth Island, hours
before waves lapped over the causeway that connects the island to
the mainland.
   In Massachusetts, the body of a Newburyport woman was found
washed up at Salisbury Beach Tuesday afternoon. Early reports said
the woman had been swept away by a wave at Plum Island, about five
miles away, but Newbury Police Chief Roger Merry said later the
woman apparently walked into the water.
   Elsewhere in Massachusetts, flooding washed out an
archaeological dig at Coast Guard Beach in Eastham. Volunteers
worked overnight Monday to try to save the 6,000-year-old campsite,
but were forced to retreat as waters rose. In Revere, residents
reported seeing at least one windsurfer testing the water even as
waves washed over a seawall.
   Civil Defense officials in Providence, R.I., closed the city's
massive hurricane gates for the first time since Hurricane Gloria
brushed the East Coast in September 1985.
   High water closed sections of roads from New Hampshire's 18-mile
seacoast to Washington County in extreme eastern Maine, leaving
residents of some beachfront neighborhoods temporarily isolated.
   In Wisconsin, which was blanketed by up to 22 inches of snow
Monday, schools remained closed in several counties, but government
offices, banks and shopping malls reopened under sunny skies.
Maintenance crews were working around the clock to clear streets
and highways.
   ``The snow is still drifting, but we're getting some of the
highways open to two-way traffic,'' said Steve Haag, Dane County
highway maintenance supervisor, who called the storm the worst in
his 18 years on the job.
   In Michigan, a 20-mile wide band of snow stretched from Grand
Haven south along Lake Michigan to the Ohio border, with
accumulations of up to a foot reported in Kalamazoo, the National
Weather Service said.
   Work crews continued to clean up after Monday's high winds that
left some 118,000 Michigan homes and businesses without
electricity.
   Detroit Edison Co. spokesman Martin Buffalini said fewer than
1,800 people still were without power Tuesday afternoon, down from
43,000 on Monday. In the Grand Rapids area, Consumer Power Co.
spokesman Paul Knopick said about 1,300 customers remained in the
dark.
   Iowa residents made their way back to work and school Tuesday
after digging out from up to 14 inches of snow. On Monday,
interstate highways were closed, snowplows turned back because of
drifts across roads, and mail delivery was canceled in some parts
of the state.
   Kim McCarty, the Iowa City post office's customer service
manager, said carriers probably would hear about the decision not
to deliver in that city because ``neither snow, nor rain, nor heat,
nor gloom of night'' is supposed to stop the mail.
   ``We deliver mail quite often in inclement weather,'' McCarty
said. ``Sure, there will be some ribbing. Some days you just don't
want to take risks.'' The last time mail delivery was canceled in
Iowa City was Dec. 24, 1983.

<HEAD>Mammograms Improving, FDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ability of mammograms to detect breast
cancer early has improved significantly since 1985, though slightly
higher radiation is being used, the Food and Drug Administration
said Tuesday.
   The greater radiation is justified by the improved quality of
images, the agency said. The radiation is still within FDA safety
guidelines and is about two-thirds lower than 1979 levels.
   FDA surveys of mammography equipment in 1985 showed that 36
produced substandard images. A survey by the agency in 1988 found
the rate had declined to 13 percent.
   ``I hope the surveys will encourage women to make greater use of
mammography,'' said Dr. James Mason, assistant secretary for health
at the Department of Health and Human Services. ``Early detection
and treatment offer women their best chance of surviving breast
cancer.''
   The National Cancer Institute recommends that women over 40 have
regular mammograms.
   A report on the FDA's surveys was published in the November
issue of the journal Radiology, the agency said.
   To test the X-ray machines used for mammography, the FDA uses a
plastic device embedded with tiny objects. This device is X-rayed
and the quality of the image is based on the number of the tiny
objects that cn be seen.
   The acceptable score for an image is 8, the FDA said. In 1985,
the average score was 7.8 and in 1988 the average had climbed to
9.9.
   The better quality in today's imaging devices is partly because
of improvements in equipment, including more use of X-ray machines
that are specifically designed for mammography, according to Fred
Rueter of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, one
of the authors of the article.
   He also said screen and film systems more sensitive to X-rays
are helping to produce clearer pictures.
   FDA officials said that even a substandard image may still
detect cancer earlier than if a woman relies only on breast
self-examination alone.
   But some members of Congress are concerned that only one out of
five mammography facilities meets the voluntary professional
standards of the American College of Radiology.
   Several members plan to introduce legislation next year that
would set minimum federal safety standards for mammography
services.

<HEAD>EC Preparing Big Soviet Aid Package</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community is drafting a
multibillion dollar aid package for the Soviet Union, including
food, officials said Tuesday.
   Leaders of the 12 EC states are to approve the aid when they
meet in Rome Dec. 14-15. The EC Executive Commission is readying
the package in consultation with other nations, the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   Commission President Jacques Delors outlined the measures to EC
foreign ministers at a meeting in Brussels.
   The package carries no firm price tag, but ``figures are being
mentioned of between ... ($1.36 billion and $2.72 billion) over two
years,'' Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek said.
   He and other officials said that would mainly provide for food
and transportation. The EC also plans to provide technical and
administrative aid.
   German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said, ``We have
to give a signal to support reforms'' in the Soviet Union.
   In addition, the EC is studying more long-term assistance for
the ailing Soviet economy, notably by helping make the ruble a
convertible currency and balance of payment support.
   EC aid for these purposes has not yet been calculated.
   Officials said the Community also planned to help the Soviet
Union improve its oil production.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the problem at the
heart of food shortages in the Soviet Union was ``a very poor''
distribution system.
   Germany - in gratitude for Moscow's support of German
unification - began a large-scale program last week to ship food,
from private citizens and public storage, to the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet aid package has been kept separate from EC aid plans
for other countries because of the scope of Soviet economic,
financial and food needs.

<TEXT>
   A questionable projection for an
earthquake remained in effect Tuesday, but parties along the New
Madrid Fault were over and TV crews left residents to their usually
quiet lives.
   The small towns along the fault, which runs from Marked Tree,
Ark., northeast through Missouri to Cairo, Ill., began getting back
to normal.
   ``We're not used to traffic jams,'' said Virginia Carlson,
director of the New Madrid Historical Museum. ``But I think
everybody was amused by it.''
   About 40 television satellite trucks rumbled out of this small
Mississippi River town in southeast Missouri on Tuesday after the
bulls-eye day of the projection had passed.
   ``Today, you couldn't tell that there'd ever been any talk of an
earthquake,'' said Mayor Joe Gude of Blytheville, Ark.
   Iben Browning, a business consultant from Tijares, N.M., said
that there was a 50-50 chance for a major quake in the Midwest or
several other locations between Dec. 1 and Dec. 5.
   He based his projection on unusually high tidal forces, which he
claims trigger earthquakes. Earthquake experts around the country
said Browning's projection was nothing more than a random guess and
tidal forces had nothing to do with earthquakes.
   Browning was vacationing at an undisclosed location, said his
daughter, Evelynn Garriss.
   Mrs. Garriss noted there was a big quake in the Soviet Union
within the same ``30- to 60-degree north latitudes that we were
concerned about.'' But Mrs. Garriss would not say whether that
fulfilled her father's projection.
   In any case, she noted that her father said the quake could
happen any time from 48 hours before Monday to 48 hours afterward.
   Scientists have also noted that major earthquakes occur
somewhere in the world every three days, so it's easy to make
general predictions and be correct.
   In New Madrid, T-shirts were still available and business owners
were talking about sponsoring an ``Iben Browning Day'' next year.
   Angie Holtzhouser, a spokeswoman for the chamber of commerce,
said she didn't think there would be much of a legacy from
Browning's projection for the town.
   ``Such a mega-dose of round-the-clock media I think has created
some unnecessary fear and I hope that fades quickly,'' she said.
She shrugged off fears that new industries would shun New Madrid
because of all the earthquake attention.
   ``Has it harmed California?'' she asked.
   Jack Hailey, owner of Hap's Bar, was cleaning up Tuesday from
his nearly 20-hour ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' bash that began at 6
a.m. Monday. He said he may make the party an annual event, but
next year will plan his T-shirt order better. He sold all of the 84
he had on hand.
   ``If I'd known what was going to happen, I would have had 500
more,'' Hailey said.
   In nearby Malden on Tuesday, city officials were still in the
midst of a 10-day disaster drill that sent them out of City Hall
and into an emergency center, and they've already learned plenty.
   ``It's the little things you forget,'' said City Clerk Rhonda
Hollingshad. ``One of the things we decided we really need is a
sign to let people know where we are.''
   The drill, which has brought city business to a near standstill,
will end Friday, not a moment too soon for Hollingshad.
   ``I'm going to go in Monday and work for a solid week without
going home because of everything that's piling up,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, officials began adding up the costs and benefits of
the Browning projection.
   Mississippi Emergency Management Agency Director J.E. Maher said
his agency spent at least $31,000 in recent months.
   ``In travel, in putting together materials for presentations,
it's taken a pretty substantial slice of revenue from our budget,''
he said.
   In Missouri, state officials estimated the cost at between
$40,000 and $60,000, but they weren't complaining.
   ``We got more productivity from the dollars we spent than we did
in probably three years worth of spending,'' said R.D. Ross, the
director of Missouri emergency management office.
   Kentucky officials spent about $2,800 to print up extra
pamphlets, but Mike Lynch, earthquake program coordinator for the
state, said there were other costs for emergency officials.
   ``Can we put a dollar value on my nerves?''

   A pipe carrying electrical wires broke loose
from the roof of the nation's fourth-longest land tunnels Tuesday,
striking two buses and a car during evening rush hour, police said.
One woman was injured.
   More than 500 cars were stuck in the Liberty Tunnels through
Mount Washington for about 45 minutes after five sections of tubing
fell out of their brackets onto the outbound lanes at about 5 p.m.,
said Pittsburgh police Batallion Chief John Schemm.
   The tubing contained low-voltage electrical wire and
communications wires, police said.
   Police closed both inbound and outbound lanes, snarling traffic
that was leaving downtown Pittsburgh for the heavily populated
southern suburbs. Ramps leading to the tunnels also were closed.
   Police Chief Mayer DeRoy said one woman was injured, apparently
not seriously, when the pipe hit the roof of her car and dented it.
The nature of her injury was not immediately disclosed.
   Passengers on two Port Authority Transit buses were escorted
from the tunnel on foot. Police and firefighters backed some of the
cars out of the tunnel, and were able to slowly move one lane of
traffic past the fallen pipe.
   The Liberty Bridge, which feeds the tunnels, was closed
temporarily, but reopened shortly after the accident. Tunnel
traffic was redirected over local roads on Mount Washington.
   Police and the state Transportation Department, which owns the
tunnels, were considering keeping the outbound lanes closed until
Wednesday evening for repairs, DeRoy said.
   The only tunnels in America longer than the Liberty Tunnels are
tw  Interstate 70 tunnels in Colorado and the Allegheny Tunnels on
the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

<HEAD>Hungarian Premier Says 1991 Will be Year of Deprivation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX BANDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Jozsef Antall warned
Tuesday of a year of privation for many Hungarians, as the
government tries to stem growing poverty, inflation and
unemployment and introduce a free market economy.
   ``Next year will be a year of grave tribulations, but there is a
way out,'' Antall told a hushed Parliament. ``However, that means
we must not undermine our faith and determination, but unite and
work together as a nation.
   ``The country is at a crossroads, and the hour of awakening is
at hand.''
   Hungary's $21 billion foreign debt makes it the most heavily
indebted East European country on a per capita basis. Next year,
$2.4 billion of principal will have to be repaid along with $1.7
billion in interest, and the heavy load is expected to add to the
strain of switching to a market economy.
   Inflation is at 35 percent. Unemployment, officially unknown
under the former Communist leadership, stands at 70,000 and is
expected to include 200,000 of the 4.5 million work force by next
year.
   The state MTI news agency on Monday cited statistics indicating
at least 60 percent of families are drawing on savings to make ends
meet, compared to 40 percent last year.
   In October, truckers and cabbies - furious over a planned 65
percent gasoline price increase - blocked main streets and highways
throughout Hungary for three days. Most of the population supported
the protest, forcing the government to back down and agree to
smaller price increases.
   In his televised speech Tuesday, Antall warned of ``anarchy''
and social unrest that could follow the predicted worsening of the
economy.
   ``If we cannot solve the economic tasks, cannot avoid the
decline, there will be social tensions and conflicts which will
pose a threat to our fledgling democracy,'' he told legislators.
   Antall outlined dismaying statistics:
   -Industrial productivity here is one-third that of developed
countries. Energy consumption is two to three times as high.
   -The forecast rise in oil prices and agricultural losses due to
the summer drought will cost Hungarians $2 billion.
   He blamed past Communist mismanagement for some of Hungary's
present problems, saying $4.16 billion will be needed for economic
development and $1.67 billion for environmental protection.
   ``This is what we have inherited and we must accept it - no one
will shoulder it for us,'' Antall said.
   The huge debt is due to large-scale borrowng the past 20 years,
with Hungary offering citizens Western imports and other amenities
not found elsewhere in East Europe, he said.
   Antall said dissatisfaction and discontent were justified, but
parties opposed to his conservative government coalition have been
unable to offer better solutions.
   The prime minister asked for cooperation by all sides in
Parliament prior to his government's presentation next week of a
budget with a planned deficit of $1.3 billion.

   Two white men were acquitted of murder Tuesday
in the racially-motivated slaying of a black teen-ager in a mob
attack in the city's Bensonhurst section last year.
   The jury took just four hours to return the verdicts for James
Patino and Joseph Serrano following a two-week trial. The two
smiled broadly as the verdicts were read, hugged their lawyer and
then embraced in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn.
   Also Tuesday, another jury heard closing arguments in the case
of Bensonhurst defendant John Vento, who is being retried for
murder, manslaughter and riot after his first trial ended with a
hung jury. Jurors were sequestered Tuesday evening and were
expected to begin deliberations Wednesday.
   The verdict makes Patino the first defendant in the case to be
cleared of all charges.
   ``I feel great, and my lawyer's wonderful, said Patino, 25,
outside the courthouse. ``I'm glad everything's over.''
   ``I'm sorry for what happened to Yusuf Hawkins, but I had
nothing to with it,'' said Serrano, 21, after the verdict. ``I was
confident. I was secure in my innocence.''
   Both defendants had been accused of murder, manslaughter, riot,
discrimination and other charges in the attack that resulted in the
death of Hawkins, who was shot in the mostly white Brooklyn
neighborhood on Aug. 23, 1989.
   Patino was found innocent of all the crimes. Serrano was
convicted only of a misdemeanor weapons possession charge that is
punishable by up to a year in prison.
   Prosecutor Edward Boyar shrugged and told reporters, ``I never
quibble with a jury's verdict.''
   Hawkins' killing was the most serious racial incident in the
city since the 1986 killing of a 23-year-old black man in Howard
Beach. In that confrontation, the victim was struck and killed by a
car after a mob of whites chased him onto a highway.
   Hawkins, 16, was slain when he and three friends - all black
teen-agers - went to Bensonhurst to look at a used car. The unarmed
youths attracted the attention of a mob of as many as 30
bat-wielding whites looking for a fight.
   In Vento's case, Assistant District Attorney Paul Burns said
Vento was ``an active recruiter'' and ``one of the leaders of the
mob.''
   ``Joseph Fama, acting by himself, could never have committed
this crime,'' Burns said, referring to the convicted murderer of
Hawkins.
   But defense lawyer Gerald J. DiChiara said Fama acted alone in
the shooting and said Vento had nothing to do with it.
   ``Either he aided Joe Fama in the murder, or he's not guilty,''
DiChiara said. Jurors were to begin deliberating his fate later
Tuesday.
   Fama was convicted of pulling a pistol and firing several shots
through Hawkins' chest. The mob scattered without pausing to aid
their victim or telephone the police.
   Prosecutors did not charge Serrano and Patino with shooting
Hawkins, but alleged they acted in concert with Fama and shared the
responsibility for the slaying.
   After hearing the prosecution's case, state Judge Thaddeus Owens
said their evidence was insufficient to uphold many of the charges.
He told the lawyers he would set aside the verdicts if Serrano or
Patino were convicted of murder or manslaughter.
   In allowing the jury to deliberate the charges and deliver a
finding, Owens preserved the prosecutors' right to appeal any
verdict he dismissed.
   But Owens tossed out several charges before the case went to the
jury, citing a lack of evidence. Those counts included one of two
murder charges against Serrano, a gun possession charge against
Patino and assault for both men.
   The main prosecution witnesses were Gina Feliciano and her
mother, Phyllis D'Agata. The two women said they watched from their
second-floor window as the mob pursued the blacks around a corner
where the shooting took place.
   But they were unable to place Serrano or Patino at the scene and
their testimony was filled with inconsistencies and contradictions.
   Fama is serving 32 and two-thirds years to life for his
conviction. Keith Mondello, the ringleader, was acquitted of murder
and manslaughter, but convicted of several lesser crimes. He was
sentenced to five and one-third years to 16 years.
   Several other defendants are scheduled to stand trial early next
year, including Charles Stressler, whose first case ended in a
mistrial.

   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad
capitulated to a 7-week-old campaign for his ouster Tuesday,
promising to resign as soon as the opposition chooses a
replacement.
   State-run radio announced the move in a late-night news
bulletin. Soon afterward, hundreds of people thronged the streets,
defying a curfew that restricted civilians to their homes.
   Many danced, set off fire crackers in celebration and shouted
slogans.
   ``Where is Ershad now?'' some chanted. ``Seize the airport so he
cannot flee! Catch Ershad, kill his ministers!''
   At least 1,000 people attacked a downtown office of Ershad's
Jatiya Party, reporters at the scene said. Portraits of Ershad and
office furniture were thrown into the street and set on fire, they
said.
   Security forces did not intervene or attempt to get people to
return to their homes. But troops were seen being deployed outside
the homes of government ministers to prevent further attacks.
   The radio bulletin said a special session of Parliament was
scheduled for Sunday to ratify the choice of Ershad's replacement.
   Sheik Hasina, one of two opposition leaders heading the
anti-Ershad campaign, called his resignation ``a people's
victory.''
   ``We are watching everything until the final game is over,'' she
said, adding that choosing a replacement for Ershad was ``not a
problem.''
   The campaign for Ershad's ouster had mushroomed in recent weeks.
Doctors, university professors, some of Ershad's parliamentarians
and civil servants have resigned in solidarity with the opposition.
   Last week, Ershad imposed a state of emergency and suspended all
civil rights in an attempt to crush the movement.
   The army had been called out to prevent street protests against
his rule, and the opposition claimed that at least 100 political
activists had been shot and killed. The government said only six
people had died.
   Despite the crackdown, the protests continued. On Monday, Ershad
offered to resign 45 days before June's presidential vote. He also
offered to dissolve the legislature and hold simultaneous elections
for the presidency and Parliament.
   The opposition said his concessions were not sufficient and
urged daily dawn-to-dusk strikes to force the president's immediate
resignation.
   Ms. Hasina and the second opposition leader, Khaleda Zia, have
opposed Ershad since the former army general took power in a 1982
coup. But political differences between the two hindered earlier
efforts to depose him.
   The latest campaign was launched in October after the two said
they had resolved their differences.
   Ms. Hasina is the daughter of Sheik Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's
first president. Mrs. Zia is the widow of Ziaur Rehman, another
former president. Both men were assassinated.
   On Monday, the president said in a nationally televised speech
that the emergency restrictions would be lifted on Dec. 16, the
19th anniversary of Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. He
also announced the immediate lifting of press censorship, which had
been imposed along with the emergency.
   But on Tuesday at least 19 lawmakers from Ershad's Jatiya Party
resigned from Parliament, according to a letter circulated by
Speaker Shamsul Huda Chowdhury.
   The party holds 266 of 300 seats. Giasuddin Ahmed, one lawmaker
who resigned, later said: ``The Parliament has now become isolated
from the people.''
   Despite a ban on political meetings, leaders of the three major
opposition alliances addressed rallies in Dhaka and announced daily
protest strikes.
   Cars stayed off the streets, and shops were closed in the
capital and in the southern port city of Chittagong.
   Banks and most businesses were shut. Government offices opened
in Dhaka, but with most transportation off the roads few employees
showed up for work.
   If Ershad's replacement is chosen by the opposition and approved
by Parliament, it will be the first peaceful transition of power in
Bangladesh. The country has had nine presidents since it gained
independence in 1971, and all have taken over after assassinations
or military coups. Ershad has ruled about half that time.
   Bangladesh, one of the poorest nations in the world, has more
than 107 million people. It is bordered by India, Burma and the Bay
of Bengal.
   Analysts said Ershad stayed in power so long by balancing
civilian bureaucrats against army generals and frequently shuffling
the military command to block the emergence of any rival power
centers within the establishment.
   But as the protests dragged, on observers said his support in
the army appreared less solid than earlier believed.
   Though Ershad gave Bangladesh a measure of political stability
after a quick succession of military-installed presidents, he made
little headway in alleviating the misery of his people.
   Ershad was opposed to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and sent a token
force to stand alongside the United States and its allies.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once again, an ethnic Miami neighborhood erupted,
pent-up frustrations sparked by a single incident. This time,
though, it was in a community seldom heard from.
   ``This is singular for the Puerto Rican community, but not
singular for Miami,'' said Puerto Rican-born Maurice Ferre, who was
mayor for 12 years.
   ``It seems to be a pattern now for behavior in the poor,
disadvantaged neighborhoods of Miami - black, Haitian, Puerto
Rican,'' he said.
   Ferre referred to a rampage Monday night in the city's largely
Puerto Rican community of Wynwood after the acquittal of six police
officers accused of fatally beating Puerto Rican drug dealer
Leonardo Mercado.
   As with members of other ethnic groups after earlier
disturbances, some Puerto Ricans on Tuesday talked of neglect by
Miami's dominant Cuban-American population.
   Puerto Rican flags were waved during the disturbance and there
were shouts of ``Viva Puerto Rico!'' from members of an ethnic
group that's had a low Miami profile.
   ``We want the people to know that we exist. We've got Puerto
Ricans in this city, too,'' said Clemente Montalvo, who said he's
lived all his life in Wynwood. ``It's not just because of the
Mercado trial. Cubans get everything, we get nothing. When the
Cubans jump, they get what they want.''
   Ferre and other community leaders said the reasons behind the
outbreak were complex. They said many of the looters were youthful
opportunists, and many weren't Puerto Rican or from Wynwood.
   Ferre was mayor in 1980 during Miami's worst riots, which
followed the acquittal of white police officers in the beating
death of black insurance salesman Arthur McDuffie. The rioting
claimed 18 lives and caused more than $100 million in damage.
   Black rioting broke out three other times in the 1980s, most
recently the January 1989 riots following the deaths of two blacks
after a police shooting.
   Last July, Miami riot police moved in after four days of violent
Haitian protests at a shop owned by a Cuban-American accused of
mistreating a Haitian in his store.
   The rioting Monday stunned police, city officials and many in
the Wynwood community, where Mercado had once lived.
   Ferre said such disturbances are waiting to happen in urban
areas where people feel helpless economically and politically.
   ``Somebody pushes somebody in a store. There's a perception of
an injustice. It's an explosion,'' said Ferre, who comes from one
of Puerto Rico's most influential political families and led Miami
until 1985, when he was ousted by the city's first Cuban-born
mayor, Xavier Suarez.
   Wynwood was one of the first large Hispanic neighborhoods in
Florida in the post-World War II era, populated mainly by Puerto
Rican migrant workers. There are now an estimated 55,000 Puerto
Ricans in the Miami metropolitan area, compared with more than
600,000 Cubans and more than 100,000 people each in the Nicaraguan
and Haitian communities.
   Wynwood has become more diverse in recent years, though the
Puerto Rican influence is obvious with Roberto Clemente Park, named
for the late Puerto Rican-born baseball star, and several stores
with the name ``Borinquen,'' the island term for Puerto Ricans.
   Drugs and poverty have increased, longtime residents said.
   ``It's changed quite a lot, to the negative side,'' said David
Bonilla, who lived there from 1955 and is the Puerto Rican-born
Miami city police chaplain.
   Bonilla said the outbreak involved many outsiders and wasn't a
true reflection of Wynwood. But he said some Puerto Ricans were
using the attention to seek help for their deteriorating community.
   ``Some of these people want to let somebody know that we need
help in the community,'' Bonilla said. ``They say, `Hey, while the
cameras are here, everybody's here ...' ''

<TEXT>
   Former East German Communist chief Erich Honecker
should stand trial on charges he signed shoot-to-kill orders for
guards at the Berlin Wall, a Roman Catholic bishop from east Berlin
said Tuesday.
   ``The law is the law. On humanitarian grounds this individual
humn being should not be treated differently than any other,''
Bishop Georg Sterzinsky of Berlin-Brandenburg told a news
conference.
   The Berlin justice office issued an arrest warrant Friday
charging Honecker with manslaughter. The charges directly link him
to several deaths.
   If convicted, his prison sentence could range from five years to
life.
   About 200 people died trying to escape East Germany during the
28-year existence of the Berlin Wall.
   Bishop Sterzinsky, who is based in former East Berlin, said that
it would be possible to think about sparing Honecker from prison
after sentencing. He spoke to reporters following a meeting of
Berlin bishops.
   Honecker remained Tuesday inside a Soviet hospital 20 miles
south of Berlin.
   Justice officials in Bonn denied talks had taken place with
Soviet officials about serving an arrest warrant against Honecker.
German police must have permission from the Soviets to enter the
hospital.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin said in Moscow
on Monday that Honecker was staying at the hospital for
humanitarian reasons.
   Honecker's lawyers have lodged a protest against the arrest
warrant. But the Berlin justice office said Tuesday it could take
days to make a decision. The defense counsels maintain Honecker,
78, is too ill to stand trial.

<DATELINE>OR YEHUDA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jewish museum in central Israel seems
an unlikely place in which to hear about the warm and human side of
Saddam Hussein.
   Most Israelis know him as the Arab dictator whose threats have
forced them to get gas masks. But Vicky, a Jewish immigrant from
Iraq, remembers him as the man who comforted her when she came to
him for help in getting her husband out of prison.
   Another woman recalled being protected from anti-Jewish riots by
Saddam's family in his home village of Takrit.
   The two women spoke at the Babylonian Jewry Heritage Center in
Or Yehuda, an immigrant town outside Tel Aviv, at a discussion
Sunday titled ``Saddam Hussein's mind-set on Jews, Israelis and
Zionists.''
   Vicky did not want her surname published because, she said, she
still has relatives in Iraq. She told her story in Hebrew laced
with Iraqi idioms, sitting next to her husband. She believes he was
saved from the gallows with Saddam's help.
   In 1968, a coup had installed Saddam as Iraq's No. 2 man behind
Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr. The previous regime had jailed many Jews,
including Vicky's husband and his brother, as alleged spies. She
and her sister-in-law, Naima, were desperate.
   One day, she recalled, an acquaintance gave her the address of a
man named Saddam Hussein. ``I said, who is this Saddam? Isn't he
against the Jews?''
   The acquaintance reassured her: ``He's not against anybody.''
   Next day she and Naima went to the address next to the Yarmuk
mosque in Baghdad. They asked a passer-by where they could find
Saddam Hussein. ``I am Saddam Hussein,'' he replied.
   She hadn't expected a man wearing a simple Arab robe and living
in a relatively humble house.
   ``I got a fright, of course. I started crying and fell around
his shoulders. He said, `Sister, what's the matter?''' He invited
the women into his house and his wife, Sajida, served coffee.
   ``How do you know your husband is innocent?'' Saddam asked.
   ``I know. A wife has to know everything,'' Vicky recalled
answering.
   Saddam retorted: ``When I made the revolution, my wife knew
nothing about it.'' He promised to look into the case, and told
Vicky to visit whenever she liked.
   She came to the house eight times hoping for news. She became
friendly with Sajida and Saddam's mother. Saddam had also spent
time in prison, and Sajida told Vicky, ``I know what you're going
through. I tasted it too.''
   The last time she saw Saddam, he had changed. He wore a Western
suit and tanks guarded the house by Yarmuk mosque. He told her
there was testimony implicating her husband, and that he would be
interrogated further.
   ``I knew he was being tortured. I said, `What piece of his body
will be left to interrogate?' I was very cheeky. He said, `That's
the way it is. We will investigate, and every spy we find will be
hanged.'''
   He spoke sternly, wagging a finger, and told her not to come
again.
   In January 1969, when the Iraqis hanged 13 Jews, Vicky's husband
and his brother were sentenced to three years in prison. Vicky is
convinced the relatively light sentence was influenced by Saddam
having taken a personal interest. ``I believe Saddam helped,'' she
said.
   After they were released, the family immigrated to Israel.
   How does she feel when she hears President Bush likening Saddam
to Hitler? She groped for words. ``I don't know,'' she said. ``To
me he was good.''
   Raya, who also asked that her surname not be published, grew up
in Saddam's village of Takrit and remembers her parents' friendship
with his family.
   She said her father, a wealthy businessman who brought
electrical power to Takrit, lent his car to drive Saddam's mother
to Baghdad to give birth to an older brother of Saddam.
   In 1941, when anti-Jewish riots erupted in Iraq, she and her
family hid under their beds until the villagers, including Saddam's
relatives, came to them to promise them protection.
   While fiercely hostile to Zionism, Saddam treats Iraq's tiny
150-member Jewish community benevolently, said Mordechai Ben-Porat,
an Iraq-born former Cabinet minister who sat next to Vicky and
Naima while they talked.
   He said Saddam's attitude to Jews was shaped in part by the
kindness of Takrit's Jews to his mother. ``It didn't totally
influence him,'' Ben-Porat said, ``but it definitely had an
influence.''
   Saddam has said the Israeli-Palestinian dispute should be
negotiated along with Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
   He had threatened to use chemical weapons against Israel even
before his August invasion of Kuwait. The Israeli government in
October began distributing gas masks to its citizens.

   Unlike his predecessor, Northwest Airlines
Chairman Al Checchi went before cameras after the airline's first
plane disaster since he took over last year.
   In Detroit Tuesday, Checchi visited with seven of the injured
from Monday's runway collision between two Northwest planes and
gave an emotional speech in which he mourned the eight people who
died in the accident.
   By contrast, former Northwest Chairman Steven Rothmeier let
company spokespeople do all the talking when Flight 255 went down
on Aug. 16, 1987, near the same Detroit airport, killing 156
people.
   Checchi, who was in Los Angeles when the accident occurred, went
to Detroit with a team of company officials after announcing that
the airline would pay travel and lodging costs for passengers of
the two planes and their families.
   Checchi announced Tuesday that Northwest would pay all medical
expenses and other expenses incurred by passengers and their
families. The chief executive spoke in a choking voice near the end
of his statement when he said that a Northwest flight attendant
died in the crash.
   ``As most of you know, flight attendant Heidi Joost lost her
life in the line of duty,'' Checchi said. ``And flight attendant
Mary Kay Ruane-Bolin was severely injured, but managed to pull
several peope to safety from the aircraft.''
   ``We just feel it's important for him to be there (in Detroit),
and he's made the commitment to be there,'' said Doug Miller, a
Northwest spokesman.
   It was the first plane disaster at Northwest since Checchi led a
$3.65 billion buyout of the nation's fourth-largest airline in
August 1989.
   Redmond Tyler, a former Northwest spokesman who advised
Rothmeier during the 1987 crash, said it was a mistake not to have
the chief executive appear on television to explain the company's
actions.
   ``In retrospect I would have had him on there,'' Tyler said in a
telephone interview from his home in Atlanta.
   Tyler, now a crisis management consultant, said there was a
perception that Rothmeier was ``aloof, or cold, or cool.'' But
Rothmeier cared deeply about the victims and their families and did
everything he could to help them, Tyler said.
   Contributing to Rothmeier's stony image was Northwest's refusal
to release the list of passengers on the 1987 flight. Tyler said he
made the decision not to release the list and Rothmeier supported
him, despite heavy media criticism.
   In keeping with that policy, Alan Muncaster, vice president of
corporate communications at Northwest, said Monday that Northwest
would not release the passenger list from either plane involved in
the runway collision.
   ``You infuriate the media, but really what you get is protection
for the families,'' Tyler said. ``The families ... thanked us for
that.''

<HEAD>Spain Publishes Catalogue of Original Capa Civil War Prints</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A half-century after a collection of
Spanish Civil War photographs belonging to the late Robert Capa
disappeared, the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday made public a
catalogue of the original prints.
   Capa's brother, Cornell Capa, who was instrumental in
identifying the 97 prints, looked on.
   Cornell Capa, now 72 and chief of the New York-based
International Center of Photography, catalogued the prints as works
of his older brother; or of David Seymour, co-founder with Robert
Capa of the Magnum photo agency; or of Capa's companion, Gerda
Taro.
   The younger Capa, himself a photographer who did the lab work
for much of Robert Capa's Spanish photos, said the 54-year-old
prints were in excellent condition.
   He said the negatives had disappeared ``somewhere along the
line, probably in the next war (World War II).''
   Robert Capa, born Endre Erno Friedmann in Pest, Hungary, in
1913, began his storied career as a war photographer in the 1936-39
Spanish conflict.
   He covered the Allied landings in North Africa and Normandy, the
liberation of Paris, the war in China and the birth of Israel. He
died in 1954 after stepping on an antipersonnel mine in Indochina.
   Capa changed his name in 1936, and became a U.S. citizen in
1946.
   His photographs of Spanish loyalist soldiers and militiamen
fighting rebellious troops led by Gen. Francisco Franco and of
refugees fleeing aerial bombardments brought the fratricidal
conflict into the consciousness of a world edging slowing toward
World War II.
   Included in the collection is a high-quality print of Capa's
``Falling Soldier'' taken at the Cordoba front in early September
1936.
   The stark photo of the loyalist soldier falling backward after
being shot, his rifle in his right hand, became perhaps the
best-known image of the Spanish war.
   Until the late 1970s, most Spaniards were not familiar with
Capa's photos of their war. The pictures were published abroad, and
because they highlighted the Republican side, copies or collections
of the photos were not readily available in postwar Spain.
   The prints showed up at the Foreign Ministry in Madrid in March
1979 in a small suitcase accompanied by a letter from Swedish
Ambassador Lennart Petri.
   Petri explained that the unidentified collection was delivered
to the Swedish Legation in Vichy France during the war under
mysterious circumstances and was later shipped to the Foreign
Ministry in Stockholm for safekeeping until Spain returned to
democracy.
   Franco ruled Spain from 1939 until he died in 1975. Spain
returned to full democracy four years later.
   Archivists determined that Capa gave the collection to Juan
Negrin, then prime minister, who went into exile in France in 1939
and died there in 1956.
   It wasn't until 1987, however, that serious efforts were made to
identify the photographs, at least five of which had never been
published.
   Foreign Ministry archivist Mercedes Perez Vera said the photos
would become the property of the Spanish state.
   The question remains whether the collection will join the Civil
War archives in Salamanca - available only to researchers - or
become part of a museum collection open to the public.
   Cornell Capa obtained a set of copy negatives and prints for his
brother's estate.
   The edition of the catalogue was limited to 1,000 copies.

   The bloodiest of four army
uprisings in four years was also the shortest, and President
Menem's decisive management of the crisis may strengthen his
government.
   Monday's uprising, two days before President Bush's scheduled
visit, was quickly crushed. Menem said Tuesday the rebel leaders
will be tried by military court and face the death penalty if found
guilty.
   Late Monday, after the rebels had filed out of the last of the
buildings they had seized before dawn, Menem told a news conference
that ``my pulse isn't going to tremble'' if military officers who
had rebelled repeatedly - and killed people in the proces - forfeit
their lives.
   The unofficial death toll in the uprising rose Tuesday to 14
when a soldier died from wounds suffered in putting down the
insurrection.
   Unofficial tallies put the number of wounded at nearly 60 and
the arrested at more than 400.
   The government did not disclose its figures on casualties and
arrests.
   Menem and Defense Minister Humberto Romero signed a decree that
legally separated the rebel leaders from their followers.
   While the leaders could face the death penalty, the followers
face charges in civil court, where the worst punishment is life in
prison.
   Menem ``is convinced the death penalty should be applied to end
these happenings,'' said Raul Granillo Ocampo, the president's
legal adviser.
   That attitude found support in this capital city of 10 million,
whose residents saw their democracy threatened by the uprising.
   In quelling it, air force planes bombed tanks on public roads
and a bridge was dynamited. Rebels fired at and hit Vice President
Eduardo Duhalde's helicopter.
   On Tuesday, rebels who hid overnight at a rural Buenos Aires
Province farm gave themselves up, along with three tanks they had
seized.
   Argentina's two biggest political groups, the governing
Perronist Party and the Civic Radical Union, issued a statement
with 23 other parties saying the government should punish the
rebels ``with severity.''
   The rebels had demanded a shakeup of the military high command
and a bigger military budget. Observers said they also sought to
embarrass Menem by forcing Bush to cancel a visit to Argentina on
Wednesday.
   Bush was in Uruguay on Tuesday.
   Menem refused to concede a single point, and even while rebels
still held the army headquarters, Bush said he would arrive on
schedule.
   Menem was sworn in 17 months ago amid hyperinflation, recession,
food riots and military unrest. He seemed to have strengthened his
government by choosing to fight the rebels instead of negotiating
as former President Raul Alfonsin did on three occasions.
   It did not escape Argentines' notice that under Menem, the air
force and navy for the first time helped put down an army
rebellion.
   So no one would doubt that rebels surrendered unconditionally,
they were ordered to walk out with their hands behind their necks
and shoeless, a gesture meant to humiliate them.
   The rebels ``thought the president would be frightened and give
in to their pressures,'' and become ``their puppet,'' said Adelina
Dalesio de Viola, a national deputy with the opposition Union of
the Democratic Center.
   ``But at every moment, Menem showed himself to be very firm,''
she said.
   Granillo Ocampo, Menem's aide, said the jailed leader of a
December 1988 revolt, retired Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, admitted
he played a role in the rebellion.
   He said Seineldin asked for ``a pistol with one bullet,''
presumably to kill himself, but authorities refused.
   Several other current and former officers under arrest sided
with Seineldin or cashiered Lt. Col. Aldo Rico during the April
1987 and January 1988 military uprisings.
   Late Tuesday, Menem canceled the state-of-siege decree.
   Menem's brother, Eduardo Menem, who is president of the Senate,
claimed Tuesday night the rebels intended to assassinate key
political figures.
   The list included the president, at least one Cabinet minister
and the leader of the ruling Peronist party bloc in Congress,
Eduardo Menem told the independent news agency Noticias Argentina.
   He cited state intelligence agency information, but offered no
proof to support his claim.

<TEXT>
   Iraq may be ready to withdraw from most of Kuwait
as long as it is allowed to keep the disputed Rumailah oil field,
according to a British news report Tuesday.
   British and U.S. officials said they have heard nothing of such
a proposal.
   Sky television news said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has been
spelling out his negotiating position on the Persian Gulf dispute
in private meetings with senior mediators, including Soviet envoy
Yevgeny Primakov, a top adviser on foreign affairs to Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Te report pushed spot oil prices sharply lower and propelled
the Dow Jones average in New York from a 25-point loss a half-hour
before closing to a 14-point gain to 2579.70 points at the end of
Tuesday's trading.
   In Washington, however, a senior U.S. official said on condition
of anonymity, ``We know absolutely nothing about this ... It comes
as no surprise to us that these types of rumors will be surfacing
more and more.''
   Britain's Foreign Office also said it knew of no such
negotiations, but added ``there's got to be a full and
unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait, restoration of the legitimate
government and a release of hostages.''
   The Sky-TV report said a source close to one of the negotiations
outlined to its reporter the sort of deal Saddam had in mind: In
exchange for a guarantee against any Western attack on Iraq, he
would pull out of Kuwait except for the oil field on the border.
   While much of the Rumailah oil field is in southern Iraq, it
also crosses about two miles into Kuwait.
   Sky-TV, a 24-hour news channel, is part of the Sky Television
satellite system launched by media mogul Rupert Murdoch in February
1989.
   A multinational force of more than 400,000, led by the United
States, is in the gulf to oppose Iraq. Following the passage of a
U.N. resolution last week, Saddam has been given until Jan. 15 to
withdraw or face possible attack.
   Saddam also would give back the strategically important islands
of Bubiyan and Warba, as long as Kuwait would discuss leasing them,
and he would accept the return of the Kuwaiti royal family, which
fled when Iraq invaded Aug. 2, according to the report.
   The report said the Western allies already heard of this Iraqi
position and their ambassadors discussed it after the U.N. meeting
last week.
   Sky quoted unidentified U.S. sources as saying Western
acceptance of the loss of the oil field, one of the largest in the
region, would hinge on whether the Kuwaitis were prepared to give
it up.
   It also said a delegation of senior Kuwaiti officials in the
Netherlands said all aspects of the dispute are negotiable once the
Iraqis have withdrawn, which the television report saw as an
indication the Kuwaitis might take the offer seriously.
   The delegation is in Amsterdam to urge support for armed action
against Iraq.

   A resolution calling on Iran to end human
rights abuses was adopted by a General Assembly committee Tuesday,
just as Amnesty International accused Tehran of a wave of
executions.
   The strongest wording in the draft resolution was dropped Monday
so Iran would continue cooperating with U.N. human rights
investigations and let the Red Cross visit its prisons.
   Draft language criticizing ``executions, ill-treatment and
torture'' in Iran was deleted by the assembly subcommittee dealing
with human rights. The adopted draft expresses concern over
``allegations of violations of human rights'' in a U.N. report.
   Iran joined in the consensus Tuesday to recommend sending the
resolution to the full General Assembly, where it will be adopted
later this month.
   At the same hour the resolution was adopted, London-based
Amnesty said Iran has executed more than 5,000 people in the past
three years. Many people were killed for their political beliefs,
the organization said.
   Amnesty officials said it was coincidence that the release of
the report came on the same day as the resolution vote.
   Isobelle Jaques, Amnesty International's delegate to the United
Nations, criticized the compromise wording of the resolution.
   ``I feel that the resolution ought to address the actual human
rights situation in Iran,'' she said. ``I don't think that the
resolution which was adopted today really reflects that.''
   But a European diplomat involved in the compromise defended it,
saying it ``contains the substance of the original resolution'' in
return for securing Iran's cooperation. The diplomat spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``It's not ideal, but it's significant,'' added Saleh Rajavi, a
U.N. representative for the People's Mujahedeen of Iran, an exile
group seeking to topple Iran's Moslem fundamentalist government.
   ``What's important is that the continuation of the monitoring of
rights abuses in Iran is still stipulated as a mandate of the U.N.
body,'' Rajavi said.
   ``It was a failure for the Iranian regime,'' he said. ``They
admitted in that resolution to their own crimes.''
   Amnesty International's report said Iranian dissidents are
arrested and tortured, some for only signing a letter criticizing a
lack of human rights and freedoms.
   The organization quoted former prisoners as saying a ``death
commission'' of Iranian officials chose prisoners daily for
execution if their views were not acceptable.
   In 1988, more than 2,500 political prisoners were killed
secretly in a few months on orders of the commission, Amnesty
International said.
   Thousands more have been executed after summary trials in which
they were convicted of criminal offenses, it said. Crackdowns on
drug trafficking led to more than 1,100 executions in 1989, it
said.
   The U.N. report used as the basis for the resolution was
prepared by Reynaldo Galindo Pohl of El Salvador, who has done
critical U.N. reports on Iran's human rights abuses since 1984. He
was only allowed to visit the country in the last year.
   Tehran invited Galindo because his previous reports were based
heavily on testimony from exiles and emigres who resent Iran's
theocracy.
   Galindo's latest U.N. report was not as harsh as many human
righs advocates might have hoped, but it severely criticized the
climate of fear he found in Iran and noted many executions and
abuses of due process.
   The original resolution would have had the General Assembly
express ``its concern about the numerous allegations of violations
of human rights contained in the report ... notably those
concerning executions, ill-treatment and torture.''
   The draft now calls on Iran to ``investigate and rectify the
human rights issues raised by the special representative, in
particular as regards administration of justice and due process of
law.''
   Responding to the Amnesty report, Iran's official news agency
IRNA said Galindo reported that ``many of the people listed by
Amnesty International as having been executed are actually still
alive.'' The news agency said Galindo spoke with four of them in a
Tehran prison.
   IRNA said the names were on a list given to Amnesty
International by the Mujahedeen Khalq opposition group.
   Amnesty said it would have no comment until it reviewed the IRNA
statement.

   The curious crowded windows at an airport
terminal Tuesday for a look at the scorched DC-9 jetliner where
eight people died in a runway collision.
   ``As I look at that plane, just thinking how miraculous it was
that anyone got out of there alive,'' said Ken Blake, a Detroit
resident waiting for a friend to arrive.
   A squat tug-like tractor pulled the charred hulk of the
Northwest DC-9 to a hangar, then dragged the Northwest Boeing 727
to another hangar. The DC-9 turned into the path of the 727 on
Monday at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in a heavy fog.
   The eight dead apparently died from noxious fumes before a flash
fire on the DC-9 burned them beyond recognition, authorities said.
A total of 188 people on the two jets survived.
   Runway 3C was closed Tuesday while the airport bustled with
normal activity. Christmas music played softly throughout the
airport.
   ``It's so gruesome. And then you sit and listen to this
Christmas music,'' said Ronnie Vest of Canton Township, Mich. ``I'm
not crazy about flying anyway and this only makes it worse.''
   Dennis Betz of Toledo stood in the concourse awaiting a flight
to Kansas City, eyes fixed on the DC-9 wreckage. ``I was thinking
about driving back to Kansas City but it's still the safest way to
travel,'' he said.
   Barb Wolf of Phoenix was back in the concourse for the second
straight day. Her flight to Phoenix was canceled a day earlier. She
was in a perfect place to see Monday's accident, if anyone could
have.
   The fog was so thick, she couldn't see more than 50 feet out the
window.
   ``It had to be right in front of us,'' she said. ``The first
thing we knew something was wrong was when we saw fire trucks and
ambulances heading out that way. And then the fog cleared and there
it was.''
   ``It horrifies me to look at that plane there and to know people
died on it,'' Ms. Wolf said.

<HEAD>`Liberty Bell' Maker Trying To Wring Money Out of City Hall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manufacturer of Liberty Bell replicas is
trying a bit of bill wringing on nearly broke City Hall.
   City contracts for diminutive copies of the cracked bell - the
ones proudly handed out to visiting VIPs - represent about
one-fifth of Ampros Trophy Kings' business, says owner Burt
Liebman.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode's administration has stopped paying its
bills on time as the city's fiscal crunch has worsened over the
past three months, leaving Liebman out $21,828.14 he says he's
owed.
   Because the city won't pay, Liebman says he's had to lay off
workers - and delay payments to his own creditors.
   ``Everything has been geared back,'' Liebman said Tuesday. ``I'm
upset, but I can't be angry. The city has been good to me for 30
years.''
   The city knows that its action will cause problems for many of
its small suppliers, but says it can pay only high-priority bills,
related to health and safety, or for services performed before
Sept. 1.
   The bell miniatures, which are given to dignitaries as a symbol
of Philadelphia's heritage, are made at Liebman's plant.
   Each year, the family business makes about 1,200 small bells and
600 larger ones for the city, and also makes plaques and trophies
and markers for veterans' graves.
   City Finance Director Elizabeth C. Reveal said Tuesday that the
city owes about $36.7 million to its vendors, and may withhold
another $30 million until the fiscal crisis is solved.
   ``There's going to be a very serious effect on the local
economy'' if the problem continues another three months, she said.
   Administration officials have urged the state treasury, city
pension fund, local banks and private investors to back the sale of
more than $250 million in short-term notes to keep the city from
running out of money later this month. On Monday, State Treasurer
Catherine Baker Knoll said her department could not legally lend
money to help Philadelphia.
   The city's financial mess will harm some of the city's 10,000
vendors, with whom the city does more than $2 billion business
annually, and may force others into bankruptcy, Ms. Reveal
acknowledged Tuesday.
   Liebman says his company already is hurting. While waiting for
the city to pay up, he's been forced to lay off four of his 29
workers and has had to do some creative accounting to stay afloat.
   ``I realize the city of Philadelphia has many financial problems
and the only bills that are being paid are those deemed necessary
to keep the city running,'' Liebman wrote Goode on Nov. 28. ``You
can understand, Mr. Mayor, what may not be critical bills to the
city are indeed critical to the lifeblood of our company.''
   Despite the problems, Liebman said the company would continue to
supply the city with the Liberty Bells.
   ``We're Philadelphians,'' he said.

<HEAD>Israel May Use Deportations To Stem Arab Stabbing Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cabinet ministers said Tuesday that Israel may
deport Palestinian activists as one way to stem a wave of Arab
stabbing attacks.
   Israel has expelled 60 Palestinians during their 3-year-old
revolt, but eased up on deportations in recent months following
repeated Western protests that such action was inhumane.
   Right-wing leaders want deportations back again following
Sunday's fatal bus stabbing of an Israeli near Tel Aviv, the 12th
such attack on Jews in six weeks.
   Justice Minister Dan Meridor said on Israel television, ``Not
only is there no deterrent to expulsions but we must acknowledge
there is no choice but to use the weapon of deportation as well
against inciters'' of violence.
   Meridor, of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud
bloc, added: ``The developments of the last few weeks show a need
for new thinking, intensive action ... If we prove our forbearance,
our ability to stand up, we will win.''
   Israeli news media said Defense Minister Moshe Arens was
exploring ways of expediting deporation procedures, since
expulsions are often delayed by appeals to the Supreme Court.
   Arens' spokesman Danny Naveh said in an interview that the idea
of deporting Arabs linked to attacks on Israelis is ``always on the
agenda.'' He noted that Arens considered deportations an
``effective means'' against violence, but declined to elaborate.
   In Beit Fajar, a West Bank village near Bethlehem, soldiers
ambushed activists Monday night at a common site for stone-throwing
attacks, shooting and wounding one protester in the leg, the army
said.
   Arab and Israeli reports said a second youth Anwar, Ahmad
Taqatqa, 17, was wounded and later died of injuries.
   The army said it could not confirm Taqatqa died as a result of
gunfire because the body was buried without autopsy.
   He was the 776th Palestinian killed by Israelis in the revolt
against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Fifty-three Israelis also have died.

   Saddam Hussein on Tuesday backed away from his confrontation
with the Kremlin, promising to release the 3,300 Soviets he was
holding. Moscow had warned it would use military force against Iraq
if Soviets there were harmed.
   Meanwhile, according to a British news report late Tuesday, Iraq
may be ready to withdraw from most of Kuwait as long as it is
allowed to keep the disputed Rumailah oil field that crosses two
miles into Kuwaiti territory.
   The rumors fanned speculation the Persian Gulf crisis could be
resolved without bloodshed.
   British and U.S. officials said they have heard nothing of such
a proposal.
   In New York, a late burst of buying sparked by the Sky
television report lifted the stock market from a 25-point decline a
half-hour before closing to a gain of 14.11 points to 2,579.70.
   The report also pushed crude oil prices below $30 a barrel on
the spot market, analysts said. The report came after the close of
the New York Mercantile Exchange, where crude closed up $1.51 to
$30.66.
   Sky TV said Saddam has been detailing his negotiating position
on the gulf dispute in private meetings with mediators that include
Soviet envoy Yevgeny Primakov, a top foreign adviser to Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   In Washington late Tuesday, a senior U.S. official said the
report was news to the Bush administration, and that they had heard
nothing on any such negotiations.
   In exchange for a guarantee against any Western attack on Iraq,
the report said Iraqi forces would pull out of all of Kuwait except
for the oil field in southern Iraq.
   Saddam also would give back the strategically important islands
of Bubiyan and Warba, as long as Kuwait would discuss leasing them,
and he would accept the return of the Kuwaiti royal family, which
fled when Iraq invaded Aug. 2, according to the report.
   Before the gulf crisis began, Moscow was Iraq's chief weapons
supplier and main ally. The Kremlin has not sent troops to join the
U.S.-led multinational force stationed in Saudi Arabia.
   Speaking in Montevideo, Uruguay, earlier Tuesday on his second
stop on a South American tour, President Bush said Saddam ``has not
gotten the message'' that he must get out of Kuwait.
   Britain's prime minister, John Major, also talked tough on the
gulf, ruling out negotiations with Iraq or any ``partial solutions
or linkages to other issues.''
   The Soviets, mainly oil industry experts, will be allowed to
leave Baghdad beginning Wednesday, the official Iraqi News Agency
said. It reported, however, that Moscow would have to pay
compensation for broken contracts.
   Iraq had warned foreign companies and employees it would demand
compensation for any contract breached after its invasion.
   In Moscow, presidential spokesman Vitaly Ignatenko said 3,232
Soviets remained in Iraq. Thousands more left in the months after
the invasion.
   Moscow adopted a harder line against Iraq last week when it
accused Saddam of breaking a promise to allow Soviets to leave.
   Iraq is holding hundreds of Westerners, many at strategic sites,
to deter attack by the 340,000-strong U.S.-led multinational force
deployed in the gulf. Soviets are not believed among those used as
``human shields.''
   Saddam has said he would free all hostages between Christmas and
March 25 provided Washington and its allies do not take military
action. That period is considered the optimum time for an offensive
to drive the Iraqis from Kuwait.
   The Iraqi decision Tuesday was seen as an attempt by Saddam to
forestall any Soviet military intervention in the gulf that might
cement the U.S.-led coalition already poised in the region against
him.
   But releasing the Soviets is not likely to assuage Moscow's
mounting impatience with Saddam over his refusal to leave Kuwait,
nor imperil its growing alliance with the West.
   In Washington, congressional hearings continued on the Bush
administration's gulf policy.
   Senate Democrats have repeatedly urged Bush to stick with the
economic embargo against Iraq, rather than rush into a war. White
House officials, however, have said the sanctions aren't working.
   ``I've not been one whose been convinced that sanctions alone
will bring him to his senses,'' Bush said Tuesday.
   Of Saddam, the president said: ``I am convinced that up until
now, at least, he has not gotten the message'' that he must
withdraw from Kuwait.
   Major addressed his first Conservative Party rally as prime
minister and said he supported President Bush's recent offer to
send Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Iraq. But he said
there should be no compromises.
   ``There can be no question of negotiations, concessions, partial
solutions or linkage to other issues,'' he said.
   Earlier, Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs
of Staff, conferred with British Defense Secretary Tom King and
held his first meeting with Major at the start of a two-day visit
to London.
   Britain last month decided to send another 14,000 troops to the
gulf, bringing its troop total to 30,000. Only the United States
has committed more soldiers to the effort against Iraq.
   Saddam has suggested a resolution to the gulf crisis should be
linked to an Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab lands. The
United States and its allies have said the Palestinian issue is
unrelated.
   Saddam met Tuesday with Jordan's King Hussein, PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat and Yemen's vice president in advance of the
U.S.-Iraqi talks on the crisis, a PLO official said. The three
comprise Saddam's main support in the conflict.
   Also Tuesday, Health Minister Abdul-Salam Mohammed Saeed said
1,400 children under age 5 have died because of shortages of
medicine, vaccines and food brought on by the U.N. trade embargo.
   There was no way to independently verify the reports. But a
doctor at one Baghdad hospital said on condition of anonymity there
was no shortage of basic medicines or medical supplies in Iraq.
   Western diplomats in Baghdad said Iraq received 30 tons of
medical supplies between mid-October and mid-November alone in
exchange for the release of Western hostages. Another 40 tons of
medical supplies reportedly were shipped to Iraq in late November,
diplomats said.
   In other developments, the British Foreign Office said Tuesday

   Bill Trappen was miffed that his seat
wouldn't recline on Northwest Airlines' Flight 1482. But when the
plane collided with another jet at Detroit Metropolitan Airport,
his seat assignment made him a hero.
   Because of a new Federal Aviation Administration regulation, the
21-year-old University of Pittsburgh student was assigned a seat
near an emergency exit through which he helped several passengers
flee the burning DC-9.
   On Oct. 5, the FAA began requiring airlines to assign exit row
seats to passengers strong enough to open exit doors in the event
of an emergency. The passengers are asked before being given the
seat if they are willing to help evacuate others. If they say no,
they are assigned another seat.
   ``In an emergency situation, it's just the sheer quickness of a
person who is able-bodied and can get the exit door open in time to
help others,'' FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein said Tuesday from his
Chicago office.
   At Northwest, gate agents are charged with recruiting passengers
for emergency exit seats, said spokesman Kevin Whalen.
   Trappen, returning to Pittsburgh after a weekend in Florida,
said he had nodded off when the wingtip of a Memphis-bound 727
jetliner speeding toward takeoff clipped the DC-9, which had turned
in front it on the fog-shrouded runway.
   The DC-9's engine was ripped off and fuel started streaming from
the jet, which held 39 passengers and four crew members. Eight
people died and 20 were injured.
   With the aisle jammed with people trying to get off at the front
of the plane, Trappen turned to the emergency exit by his seat in
row 8. He and another passenger, John Izzo, 41, of Pittsburgh,
opened the door and began leading other passengers across the win
to the runway.
   ``Until I turned around, things didn't look so bad,'' Trappen
said. ``But when I looked behind me, I could see people strapped in
their seats who were already dead, you could tell. And there were
screams.''
   Trappen said he considered Izzo the hero.
   After leading four passengers to safety, they saw a man on fire.
Izzo ``threw him on the ground, patted down the flames and got him
to a paramedic,'' Trappen said.
   Trappen was treated for a cut over his right eye. He said he'd
drive to school later in the week. Izzo, who works for Westinghouse
Nuclear Services Division near New Stanton, Pa., was on his way
home from an assignment in Michigan.
   Edelstein said disabled rights groups have criticized the FAA
rule as discriminatory.
   ``Maybe so, but if I were handicapped, I would prefer an aisle
seat, leaving the emergency exit seat to someone who can get it
open more quickly,'' he said. ``This is a perfect example, if it
happened that way.''

<HEAD>INS Releases 75; Many in California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service
said Tuesday it had released 75 Salvadorans from custody in
anticipation of a new form of legal residence for them.
   The 75 were those who may qualify for so-called ``Temporary
Protected Status'' under the new immigration law signed last week
by President Bush.
   This provision was established for Salvadorans illegally in this
country who fear returning to their war-torn homeland but
nonetheless do not qualify for regular refgee status.
   To be admitted to legal residence as a refugee, an immigrant
must demonstrate a ``well-founded fear of persecution'' at home.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service in the past has
contended that most Salvadorans who enter the United States
illegally could not qualify as refugees.
   The new law permits those Salvadorans in the United States
before Sept. 19 and here continuously since then to apply for
``Temporary Protected Status'' as of Jan. 2, permitting them to
work legally and banning their deportation.
   The law contains provision for eventual extension to citizens of
other nations. ``Temporary Protected Status'' is to last only 18
months from Jan. 1.
   An INS statement quoted the head of the service, Gene McNary, as
saying, ``In keeping with the humanitarian spirit of the Temporary
Protected Status program,'' the service was releasing Salvadorans
in custody who could qualify.
   They must remain in the United States to remain eligible.
   The statement said, ``All Salvadorans who are encountered by INS
agents in enforcement actions while this program is in effect will
be advised of the benefit and given the opportunity to show their
eligibility.''
   Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the service, said the 75 were
released from cities ``all over the country, but a good number of
them were in California.''
   Jervis estimated that about 300 Salvadorans were in custody.
Those not released either had criminal charges pending against
them, or had entered the United States after Sept. 19, he said.

<HEAD>German State Wants More Soviet Jews in Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUD S. BEELMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Germany's most influential states,
Baden-Wuerttemberg, suggested Tuesday that Soviet Jews receive
special status to bypass the country's tough immigration laws.
   The announcement by the southern state comes amid debate whether
the number of foreigners seeking to come to Germany should be
limited.
   There has been a great deal of pressure to let in more Soviet
Jews for humanitarian reasons.
   Germany's Jewish population was virtually wiped out during Adolf
Hitler's Third Reich. In 1933, there were 530,000 Jews living in
Germany. Today there are fewer than 40,000. Six million Jews were
killed during the Nazi Holocaust.
   Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to such economic giants as
Daimler-Benz, said it wanted to accept Soviet Jews on a special
status called contingency refugees, which would allow them to live
and work in Germany without having to apply for formal immigration
or go through the lengthy political asylum process.
   The special classification requires approval of Germany's 16
states, whose top officials will discuss the issue this month.
   ``We are not a country of immigrants,'' Detlef Dauka, spokesman
for Bonn's Interior Ministry said. ``That means Soviet Jews
normally would have no possibility to come to Germany, except to
apply as asylum seekers.''
   About 3 percent of all people claiming political asylum are
legally accepted, officials say.
   Dauka said the proposal regarding Soviet Jews was being
considered because the opening of Soviet society has made it
difficult for Jews to prove they are persecuted and entitled to
political asylum.
   At the same time, rising nationalism has provoked an increase in
anti-Semitic incidents in the Soviet Union.
   An estimated 150,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated this year to
Israel, where officials say services are strained by the influx.
Israeli officials believe the number of Soviet Jewish immigrants
could reach 1 million by 1992.
   Only residents of other European Community countries and ethnic
Germans can easily settle and work legally in Germany. The rest
must apply for political asylum or immigrate.
   Baden-Wuerttemberg spokesman Manfred Zach said in the state
capital of Stuttgart that quick action was needed to help the
Soviet Jews.
   Zach said the process should be coordinated through leaders of
the German Jewish community. He said the special status should
apply mainly to German-speaking Soviet Jews, those of German origin
or those who could prove family relations in Germany.
   The government's Interior Ministry announced Tuesday that the
number of asylum-seekers in Germany continued to climb in November.
The ministry said 18,314 people entered Germany seeking asylum, an
increase over 18,261 in October. In September, 24,048 asylum
seekers registered with the goverment.
   Jewish community leader Heinz Galinski, reached at home in
Berlin for comment Tuesday night, hung up the teeephone before a
question on the issue could be asked.
   Other Jewish leaders could not be reached for comment.

   Two earth tremors of medium intensity shook
parts of the central Andes Tuesday, the Geophysical Institute said.
   Institute chief Mateo Casaverde said the jolts measured 4.3 and
4.2 degrees on the Richter scale.
   Casaverde said the first was centered in the mountainous Cerro
de Pasco region 110 miles northeast of Lima and the second in the
department of Lima 80 miles southeast of the capital.
   Neither temblor caused casualties or damages, he said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a

<HEAD>Study: Drivers in East More Likely to Drink and Drive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EMMAUS, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drivers in the East are more likely to drink
and drive than those in the South, and people in the wide-open West
are most likely to speed, a study released Tuesday showed.
   But Westerners are slightly more likely to buckle up when they
drive.
   The Louis Harris poll on auto safety in America was commissioned
by Prevention magazine and General Motors Corp. Among its findings:
   - A significant drop - 17 percent - in the past five years in
the number of young drivers who say they sometimes drink and drive.
But more affluent, college-educated people are four times as likely
to drink and drive than those who never graduated from high school.
   - In states without a mandatory seat belt law, 72 percent of
those responding would support one.
   - Twice as many men as women admit to sometimes driving after
drinking (28 percent to 14 percent).
   - Seventy-nine percent of those surveyed support expanded use of
police roadblocks or checkpoints to reduce drunken driving.
   - While 30 percent would pay an extra $500 for an air bag, 38
percent think accidental inflation is a serious problem and 35
percent think they can trap people in their car.
   ``Greater public understanding of air bags and their benefits
would likely result in greater willingness to pay for them,'' said
Thomas Dybdahl, one of the report's authors.
   The survey showed a big jump in the percentage of people who say
they always wear seat belts in the front seat, from 19 percent in a
1984 survey to 63 percent in the recent survey.
   Sixty-seven percent of the drivers in the West said they always
buckle up; Easterners ranked lowest at 60 percent, although this
difference is minimal, the authors said.
   Seat belt use is reflected in education and income levels, the
survey found. It said 74 percent of college grads always buckle up,
compared with 52 percent of those who didn't graduate high school.
Among those with household income above $50,000, 73 percent always
wear belts, compared with 51 percent in the under-$15,000 income
bracket.
   Younger drivers may be increasingly aware of the hazards of
drinking and driving: The survey said 24 percent of those 18 to 29
said they sometimes drive after drinking, a drop from 41 percent in
1984.
   For those 30 to 39, the drinking-and-driving figure was 31
percent, down just 2 points from the earlier survey; for the
40-to-49 age group, 23 percent, down from 32 percent; for the
50-to-64 age group, 14 percent, down from 22 percent.
   Twenty-seven percent of the Eastern adults said they sometimes
drink and drive; in the South, the figure was 15 percent. One
reason, the survey said, is that half of all Southerners say they
don't drink at all, compared with 31 percent of Easterners.
   The figure for drinking and driving in the Midwest was 25
percent, and in the West, 21 percent.
   The survey showed that 53 percent of the drivers in the Midwest
and South say they never exceed the speed limit; in the East, it
was 45 percent; in the West, 41 percent.
   And which sex is more likely to obey the speed limit? Women, by
a 54 percent to 44 percent margin.
   The random survey of 1,250 adults nationwide was done in
November and December 1989.
   The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Upholds Housing Project Gun Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge upheld a ban on guns in the
city's public housing projects, setting a precedent for the rest of
the nation, the housing authority director said Tuesday.
   The ruling Monday by U.S. District Judge Richard L. Williams
marked the first time a court has decided whether public housing
residents can be barred from having guns, said Richard Gentry,
executive director of the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing
Authority.
   Gentry said guns also are banned in public housing projects in
Chicago, but that ban has not been challenged in court.
   ``This is a unique court case,'' he said. ``Now this can be used
as a precedent throughout the country.''
   Williams said the ban was ``part of a good faith effort to
improve the safety and quality of life in public housing.''
   Richmond, which has one of the highest murder rates in the
country, has been plagued by drug-related shootings and other
violence at its 4,500 public housing units. A third of the city's
600 shootings a year take place in public housing complexes,
evidence showed.
   In its lawsuit challenging the gun ban and other provisions of a
new lease, the Richmond Tenants Organization said the requirements
made the city's 14,000 public housing residents second-class
citizens.
   Williams issued an injunction that kept the lease from going
into effect last month, but after hearing testimony last week
upheld all but a few of the lease provisions.
   ``The widespread presence of drugs and guns have created an
atmosphere of fear and intimidation which now permeates the public
housing developments,'' he wrote.
   ``There is substantial evidence that eliminating guns will
reduce crime in the developments and reduce accidental death.
Despite conflicting expert testimony, this court finds that a
prohibition on firearms from public housing is a reasonable lease
term,'' Williams added.
   He permitted specific bans on firearms, blackjacks, explosive
devices and nunchucks, a martial arts weapon. He struck a line
banning ``weapons of any type'' because that could mean kitchen
knives or anything else used to hurt someone.
   Williams also struck a provision that would have caused tenants
to lose their lease if they committed misdemeanor drug or alcohol
violations away from the public housing area.
   Alma Barlow, president of the tenants organization, said she was
disappointed with the ruling but had not decided whether to appeal.
Lawyers for the Central Virginia Legal Aid Society, which
represented the tenants, would not comment.
   Gentry said tenants would be given civil court hearings before
being thrown out for violating the lease.
   ``It has never been our intent nor will it ever be to conduct
raids on residents or to hassle our residents,'' he said. ``When we
become aware of a problem, we will be able to take action.''

<TEXT>
   The inventor of a device used by a woman
to kill herself refused to answer questions Tuesday during a
hearing on whether the machine should be shelved forever.
   Dr. Jack Kevorkian invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination when questioned by a prosecutor seeking a
permanent injunction against Kevorkian's use of the machine.
   The retired pathologist hooked a 54-year-old woman with
Alzheimer's disease to the machine so she could inject herself with
a fatal dose of an anesthetic and a heart-stopping drug.
   Kevorkian, 62, was charged Monday with first-degree murder in
the June 4 death of Janet Adkins of Portland, Ore.
   He refused to answer any questions when prosecutor Michael
Modelski called him to the witness stand during the hearing to
determine whether a temporary order against Kevorkian's use of the
machine should be made permanent.
   ``On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment,''
Kevorkian repeated to each of Modelski's questions, including
requests for the doctor to state his name, occupation, education
and medical background.
   Circuit Court Judge Alice L. Gilbert adjourned the hearing until
Monday.
   If Kevorkian testified, his right to a fair trial in a criminal
case would be jeopardized, said Kevorkian's attorney, Geoffrey
Fieger.
   ``Dr. Kevorkian in this case has a right to defend himself but
he can't get on the stand while he has a criminal case against
him,'' Fieger said.
   ``I believe the prosecution has engaged in manipulation of the
judicial process,'' he said, referring to the timing of the
criminal charges filed just a day before the scheduled hearing on a
permanent injunction.
   Fieger said he would ask the Michigan Court of Appeals to
dismiss the civil case.
   Kevorkian, who has deferred questions about the criminal charges
to Fieger, spoke to reporters briefly after the hearing.
   ``I'm committed to the medical aspect of this,'' he said, adding
that the medical community should address the rights of terminally
ill patients to take their own lives.
   Kevorkian spent several hours Monday night at Oakland County
Jail before he was freed on $50,000 bond.

   Scientists on Tuesday displayed the
first picture taken by what will soon be the world's most powerful
optical telescope, a huge instrument designed to peer deeper into
space than ever before.
   When it is completed, the $94.2 million Keck Telescope at Mauna
Kea, Hawaii, will be the world's largest, with a mirror 10 meters
in diameter. It also is the first to be built of automated mirror
segments.
   Astronomers say the Keck will enable them to gaze back 12
billion years in time by revealing light images still traveling
toward Earth.
   ``These are really time machines, given the finite speed of
light,'' said Edward Stone, chairman of the California Association
of Research in Astronomy, composed of scientists from the
California Institute of Technology and the University of
California.
   The photo of galaxy NGC 1232, taken with only a quarter of the
Keck's 36 mirror segments in place, more than matched the quality
of images from the world's largest effective telescope, the 5-meter
Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory.
   The image was taken Nov. 24 from the W.M. Keck Observatory on
Mauna Kea, a 13,796-foot volcano on the island of Hawaii.
   The picture of the galaxy, 65 million light years from Earth in
the constellation Eridanus, marks the telescope's ``first light,''
a term astronomers use to describe the first viewing through a new
telescope.
   The photo has no particular scientific value; NGC 1232 was
selected simply to demonstrate the optical quality of the
telescope, said mirror designer Jerry Nelson, an astronomer at the
University of California, Berkeley.
   ``When we first saw the picture we were really thrilled,'' said
Nelson. ``We were all hopping up and down.''
   The telescope won't be fully functioning until late next year,
with all mirror segments in place and precision cameras mounted to
record the images it returns.
   When it is completed, the Keck Telescope is expected to be twice
as powerful as the Hale and far more accurate and reliable than a
6-meter Soviet telescope that is frequently inoperable.
   The Keck differs from other large telescopes in that its mirror
is made up of separate hexagonal mirror segments 6 feet in
diameter. The aluminum-coated mirrors are kept in alignment within
1-millionth of an inch by computer-controlled sensors.
   Stone said a single-piece 10-meter-wide mirror probably could
not be constructed with existing technology.
   The telescope will offer research opportunities not possible
with the Hubble Space Telescope, launched earlier this year by a
space shuttle. Because it orbits Earth above the distorting effects
of the atmosphere, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope was
supposed to see farther into the universe than the Keck, even
though the Hubble has a smaller mirror.
   NASA discovered after it was launched that the Hubble's mirror
was flawed during construction, rendering it less powerful than
planned until a space shuttle crew can fix it in 1993.
   However, the Keck, with its large, light-gathering mirror, will
be a better instrument for analyzing the light spectrums of stars.
Stone said this will enable scientists to better understand the
nature of the stars and calculate their speed.
   By providing images that reach back 12 billion years, scientists
will see stars as they appeared some 3 billion years after the
birth of the universe. Palomar, by contrast, reaches back only 8
billion years.
   Caltech and the University of California are sharing the cost of
the telescope. Caltech, aided by a $70 million grant from the W.M.
Keck Foundation, put up the $87 million the project originally was
expected to cost. Overruns of $7.2 million will be shared by the
two universities, and UC will pay the annual operating cost of
about $3 million, Stone said.
   Nelson said Mauna Kea is considered the world's best site for a
telescope because its high altitude reduces atmospheric
distortions. But the thin air often impairs researchers' thinking
ability and causes severe headaches, he said. As a result,
operations must be carefully planned and monitored by the project's
sea-level headquarters.

<HEAD>Academy Won't Award Milli Vanilli Grammy To Another Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Academy of Recording Arts
and Sciences announced Tuesday the 1989 best new artist Grammy,
which was stripped from Milli Vanilli last month, will not be
awarded to another group or artist.
   ``The Grammy process does not, and is not intended to produce a
ranked result,'' Michael Greene, president of the academy, said
Tuesday.
   ``The Grammy procedure is not structured as a `win, place or
show' situation,'' he said in a statement. ``There is one winner.
There is no first runner-up. We either have a winner or we give no
award.''
   Greene said the organization's Board of Trustees met Monday in
New York and decided that ``when a Grammy award is withdrawn
following the presentation, as is the case with Milli Vanilli, the
category will remain vacant.''
   The academy stripped Milli Vanilli of its Grammy on Nov. 19,
after German record producer, Frank Farian, confirmed rumors that
Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan were just front men on the album
that won the award in February as best new artist.
   In a separate action, the academy reaffirmed that the Milli
Vanilli single, ``Blame It On The Rain,'' written by Diane Warren,
remains eligible for the 1990 Song of the Year category because the
award is for songwriting.
   ``All other entries from Milli Vanilli have been deemed
ineligible,'' Greene said.
   Three Milli Vanilli entries were among the 8,000 other entries
in the 1990 Grammy nomination process and were distributed and
compiled before the academy's decision to rescind the duo's Grammy,
he said.
   The group's first and only album, ``Girl You Know It's True,''
sold 7 million copies and made the two unknowns international
stars.
   Pilatus and Morvan, both 25, said the album actually featured
vocalists Johnny Davis, Brad Howell and Charles Shaw.
   The deception began to unravel at a 1989 concert when their
audio system playing the album ``Girl You Know Its True'' started
to skip like a broken record. The recording at the Bristol, Conn.,
show kept rerunning the lyrics: ``Girl you know it's, Girl you know
it's ...''

   A retired army colonel, arrested in
October on charges of plotting against President Guillermo Endara's
government, broke jail Tuesday and fled in a helicopter, government
sources and his lawyer said.
   Former Col. Eduardo Herrera Hassan escaped from Naos Island in
the Pacific Ocean and flew to the Tinajitas military barracks on
the outskirts of Panama City, an official at the attorney general's
office said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had
no details and did not know what Herrera was doing at the barracks.
   Herrera served in the now disbanded Defense Forces of ousted
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Following his arrest on charges of plotting against the security
of the state, he was held for trial at Nao, a small resort island
that also has a jail.
   Rafael Rodriguez, Herrera's lawyer, confirmed in a live
interview with the private radio station La Exitosa that Herrera
fled the island, but refused to elaborate.
   A U.S. military invasion of Panama deposed Noriega in December
1989 and he was taken to Miami, where he is awaiting trial on drug
trafficking and money laundering charges.
   Endara's government succeeded Noriega the day after the
invasion.

   Guerrillas using a

   On Nov. 23, a rebel rocket downed an A-37 fighter bomber over
eastern El Salvador, the first such incident in 11 years of civil
war.
   The military office also reported a rebel artillery attack on
government bases in Usulutan, 70 miles east of the capital, but
reported no government casualties. It said five rebels died in the
fighting there.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, in its daily
radio broadcast, claimed it killed or wounded 23 soldiers and
captured two.
   The rebels say the offensive was launched to push along a
stalled peace process.
   President Alfredo Cristiani has said the offensive could
endanger the peace talks. U.N. officials have said they see no
immediate danger of that.

   Communist rebels killed a security
police officer Wednesday about two miles from where negotiators
were holding talks on the future of U.S. military bases in the
Philippines, authorities said.
   A policeman was also wounded in the attack, the third officer
injured by rebels in the capital this week.
   Police said three gunmen opened fire on a vehicle carrying
Constabulary Maj. Rolando Aguila as it slowed down to cross a
railroad track in the city's San Andres district near his home.
Aguila, 42, died instantly from at least 15 gunshot wounds, police
said.
   The gunmen also fired on a passing police car before they fled.
   The constabulary, the country's security police force, is a
branch of the armed forces.
   ``I heard the shots and I was told by my neighbors that the
major was ambushed,'' she said Aguila's wife, Mer.``He was
unescorted because he is confident that he has no enemies.''
   The attack was not believed to be directly related to the talks
on the bases.
   U.S. officials have issued travel restrictions for the 40,000
U.S. troops, Defense Department civilians and military dependents
during the talks.

   An engineer who complained she was
harassed after raising safety concerns about draining nuclear waste
storage tanks reached agreement Tuesday with her employer, the
company said.
   Inez Austin agreed to withdraw a complaint she filed with the
U.S. Department of Labor and also agreed not to participate in any
legal action against Westinghouse Hanford Co. arising from the
case.
   Westinghouse is the main government contractor at the
560-square-mile Hanford nuclear reservation in south-central
Washington. Hanford for decades produced plutonium for nuclear
weapons, but now is largely focusing on cleaning up years of
contamination at the site.
   Ms. Austin told reporters recently that she had been harassed by
her supervisors after warning last summer that pumping radioactive
liquids from two nuclear waste storage tanks could cause the
contents to explode.
   A General Accounting Office report issued later said too little
was known about the explosive potential of the tanks, and plans to
pump them were canceled.
   Under Tuesday's agreement, the company admitted no wrongdoing.
Ms. Austin, who has worked at the company since 1979, remains a
Westinghouse employee.
   The company pursued the agreement to encourage whistle-blowers
to come forward, said Westinghouse Hanford President Roger Nichols.
``Now is not the time to send our employees the wrong messages
about our desire to have them raise concerns.''
   Calls to Ms. Austin's office and home for comment were not
immediately returned Tuesday.
   Under terms of the agreement, a letter of reprimand will be
removed from Ms. Austin's file; her latest performance appraisal
will be upgraded; she will be offered a choice of new transfer
assignments within the company; she will get a pay increase and
overtime; she will receive one month of paid time off; and her
$5,000 in legal fees will be paid by the company.

   By repeatedly urging President Bush to stick
with the economic embargo against Iraq, Senate Democrats are
turning aside the administration's bleak assessment of the
sanctions' effectiveness.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., made the point repeatedly during five days
of hearings that he engineered as chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee. Day after day, former U.S. defense officials
urged the White House to give the sanctions more time - bolstering
the Democratic challenge to Bush's strategy.
   When two current officials - Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and
Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff - finally
testified on Monday, Nunn asked them if the administration was
dismissing sanctions too easily.
   ``If we go to war, we never will know whether they would have
worked,'' said Nunn, who has criticized the president's decision to
increase the number of U.S. troops in the region to more than
440,000.

   ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) - Investigators today tried to determine
whether a pilot was lost on a foggy runway when he turned his
jetliner into the path of another and caused a ``kerosene torch''
collision that killed eight people.
   Monday's collision of a Boeing 727 and a DC-9, both operated by
Northwest Airlines, reduced one plane to a blackened shell, its
roof burned away. At least 20 people were hospitalized with burns,
broken bones, smoke inhalation and other injuries.
   The 727 was racing down a runway toward takeoff at Detroit
Metropolitan Airport when its wing was sheared off by the DC-9,
which had turned in front of it. Fuel poured from the planes and
the DC-9 burst into flames, killing eight of the 43 people aboard.
   ``It was like a big kerosene torch,'' said passenger John Izzo,
41, of Pittsburgh, who escaped uninjured by jumping off a wing.
   ---&equals;
   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) - A physician who hooked a woman to a
machine that let her take her life with the press of a button was
charged with murder by a prosecutor who said the switch did not
relieve the doctor of responsibility.
   Dr. Jack Kevorkian, known as ``Dr. Death'' for his invention,
helped a 54-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease use the machine
to inject herself with a fatal dose of an anesthetic and a
heart-stopping drug on June 4.
   ``Dr. Kevorkian was the primary and legal cause of Janet Adkins'
death. He cannot avoid his criminal culpability by the clever use
of a switch,'' Oakland County Prosecutor Richard Thompson said
Monday.
   Kevorkian, a 62-year-old retired pathologist from Royal Oak,
faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole if
convicted.

   PITTSBURGH (AP) - For years pharmacist Edward Kilkeary used
arthritis medication, saline solution and sterilizing equipment to
whip up hundreds of tiny bottles of specially prescribed eye drops
for cataract patients.
   But sometime this year something went wrong.
   Two women last month each lost an eye to a virulent bacteria. At
least 10 people were hospitalized with infections, and countless
others sought help for swelling and burning caused by a toxin that
was eating away their eyes.
   The bacteria, pseudomonas, contaminated an unknown number of
bottles that were sold under the name Indocin to patients who had
recently undergone cataract surgery. The infection puzzled doctors
who treated the patients, and the drops were traced to Hieber's
Drug Store, where Kilkeary manufactured them.

   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) - The military rebellion that
turned parts of Buenos Aires into a battleground two days before
President Bush is to arrive was Argentina's fourth since 1987, and
may have been the least effective.
   Challenged immediately by the air and armored power of loyalist
troops, Monday's was the shortest and bloodiest of the four
revolts. At least 13 people were killed and about 60 wounded.
   In Brazil, Bush said he would go ahead with the scheduled state
visit.
   While earlier barracks rebellions forced shake-ups in the high
command and bigger service budgets, this time ``surrender was
unconditional,'' President Carlos Menem said Monday night about 18
hours after the insurrection began.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Financier Charles H. Keating Jr. probably
intended a link between his contributions to Sen. lan Cranston and
the senator's help in contacting bank regulators, the lawmaker's
former chief fund-raiser says.
   ``In retrospect, I think that there was a link there,'' Joy
Jacobson told the Senate Ethics Committee on Monday. She denied any
wrongdoing in soliciting more than $850,000 in contributions from
Keating.
   ``In the context in which I saw these contributions, I did not
know all the other things that were going on,'' she said.
   Testifying in the committee's hearings into the so-called
Keating Five senators, Jacobson said she didn't know of Cranston's
repeated contacts with federal banking regulators at the time
Keating was making contributions to the California Democrat's voter
registration drives.

stuffer for indoor cats who have everything. It's their very own

squirrels and chipmunks cavorting on the TV screen.
   The 25-minute, full-color video, taped in a wooded backyard of

kitties who are bored with napping, scratching the furniture and
swatting ornaments off the Christmas tree.
   Just slip a $19.95 copy of ``Video Catnip'' into the VCR and
watch them turn into regular couch furballs. But heed the warning
at the start of the tape:
   ``While watching this video, your cat may become excited and
attempt to get inside your television set to get at the birds. ...
We strongly suggest that you remove all breakables from on top or

<HEAD>City Tries To Polish Tarnished Liberal Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD EGGLESTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The daily dose of government debate at the
state Capitol and the steady shuffle of students between university
classes can't muffle the question.
   Is Madison's long, proud tradition of liberal politics, student
activism and unbending tolerance to widely divergent groups and
views in jeopardy?
   It's the question lobbyist Ken Opin's mother, who lives on the
East Coast, asked him after reading news accounts about a rash of
anti-Semitic vandalism in Madison this summer.
   It's the question political analysts asked after U.S. Rep.
Robert Kastenmeier, a Democrat who built a reputation as a champion
of liberal causes, was ousted by a conservative after 32 years in
Congress.
   And it's the question aldermen asked after a Southeast Asian
refugee collecting aluminum cans to supplement her welfare checks
was arrested under a law designed to protect recyclables in the
city trash.
   Has this city of 180,000 changed?
   ``The world has changed,'' said Mayor Paul R. Soglin, a Vietnam
War protester whose political views and garb earned him the
nickname ``hippie mayor'' during his first term of office in the
1970s.
   After 10 years in the private sector, Soglin returned to office
two years ago.
   But instead of beads, tie-dye shirts and ponchos, he sports
tweed jackets and striped ties. And he doesn't march past the
Capitol with a throng of students to lobby for the latest cause in
social justice. Instead, he strolls downtown to court business
interests.
   ``Madison is no longer the Emerald City,'' said Orlando Bell,
president of the Madison chapter of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People. ``It has big-city problems and
it is going to have to find some big-city solutions.''
   Madison's enthrallment with its proud liberal past allowed
problems to rear mostly unnoticed during the late 1970s and 1980s,
Bell said.
   ``During the time we were in suspended animation, these problems
have been knocking on our door,'' he said.
   Striking the deepest blow to the city's image this year was the
spate of anti-Semitic vandalism, including the cutting of brake
lines on a bus carrying school children from a Jewish camp that
nearly caused a tragedy.
   The incidents forced police to guard temples and synogogues
during recent Jewish holidays.
   ``Anti-Semitism had finally hit home,'' said the Rev. Frederick
Trost, president of the Wisconsin Conference of the United Church
of Christ. ``People were astonished and shocked by it.''
   Added Mary Rouse, dean of students at the University of
Wisconsin: ``It was a very painful reminder that discrimination
occurs in every community.''
   Added to that:
   - The Nov. 6 ouster of Kastenmeier, whose incessant pursuit of
civil rights, nuclear disarmament and openness in government became
a symbol of the city's political climate during the 1960s and
1970s. Both Democrats and Republicans say political newcomer Scott
Klug capitalized on voter dissatisfaction with Congress in general.
   - The arrest of the refugee woman by police, using an
anti-scavenging ordinance passed by the city council. Prosecutors
dropped the charge in September after one alderman declared during
a council meeting that his colleagues had become more interested in
giving tax breaks to rich companies than protecting the interests
of the poor.
   - The attack on two white youths by black youths in September.
Also, in November, a gang of about 20 young men and women attacked
and robbed three people outside a tavern.
   But in Madison tradition, instead of downplaying the incidents,
city leaders condemned them as threats to the city's prevailing
ideology and discussed solutions.
   Clergy joined to assist the Jewish community and allay fears
with impassioned sermons and sharply worded editorials.
   The university instituted mandatory classes to promote racial
sensitivity.
   ``The outpouring of community response has been decisive and
overwhelming,'' state Rep. David Clarenbach said. ``Law
enforcement, the religious community, minorities have spoken with
one voice.''
   Opin, the lobbyist, said the incidents did not surprise him as
much as the reaction.
   ``I've been Jewish a long time, and I've encountered a lot of
anti-Semitism,'' he said. ``I don't think Madison is any different
in its degree of anti-Semitism. ... What's primarily different is
the community's response.''
   Even with the initial response, city leaders wonder if they have
done enough. The NAACP is seeking to build a coalition of activists
similar to the one formed in Madison in the 1960s to advance the
causes of peace, civil rights, feminism and gay rights.
   The university, with its 45,000-student body, is seeking
additional uses of its resources in fighting problems.
   ``We have to renew our commitment to civil rights and human
rights every day,'' Ms. Rouse said. ``People of all walks of life
have come together. To the extent that you can take something that
is ugly and painful and make it positive, we've done a great
deal.''

<HEAD>Rebel Indian Bowed But Vows To Keep Fighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COOKS LANDING, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The old fishing platform sags, held
up by ropes, a few rotting boards and perhaps the ghosts of
fishermen who lived at a time when Indians pulled as many salmon as
they wanted from the Columbia River.
   David Sohappy, Yakima Indian, religious leader and rebel,
believes that is a right worth a lifelong fight.
   ``I want to go fishing whenever I feel like it. With no strings
attached whatsoever,'' Sohappy says.
   It is an idea as dated as the old-fashioned platform, long since
supplanted by powerboats. But for Sohappy, there is no compromise
on his belief that Indians have the right to fish when and where
they want, guaranteed by the Yakima Indian Nation's Treaty of 1855.
   Despite a 20-month prison term, a stroke and the threat of
eviction from his ramshackle home, he refuses to give up.
   In 1984, U.S. District Judge George Boldt of Tacoma issued a
ruling limiting Indian rights to half the harvestable salmon and
steelhead in the Puget Sound region. That decision arose in part
from protests Sohappy and other Indian fishermen began in 1968 over
the state's restrictions on their fishing.
   But for all the fuss he has created, Sohappy rarely fishes,
preferring to spend his time watching soap operas and news. A frail
65-year-old man with one arm crippled by the stroke, he speaks
barely above a mumble and must lean on an old golf putter to walk.
   ``I speak softly but carry a big stick,'' he joked, brandishing
the putter.
   In the latest chapter of this rebel's saga, Sen. Brock Adams,
D-Wash., and Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, are asking the
government to stop eviction efforts against Sohappy.
   The government argues that the Cooks Landing fishing site where
Sohappy lives with his wife and some of his seven children is
supposed to be a river access point for all Indians, not a dwelling
site.
   Sohappy built a longhouse - a communal dwelling that also serves
as a church - on this spit of land on the shore of the mile-wide
Columbia east of Vancouver, Wash., in the early 1960s.
   The longhouse was a protest over the 40 homes and 37 fishing
sites of Indians that were flooded by construction of Bonneville
Dam in 1937. The government agreed in 1945 to replace those homes
and fishing sites, but has made little progress.
   Sohappy says he has a historic right to live and fish on the
river, and he vows never to leave the home he returned to after his
release from prison in May 1988.
   ``Move out and let them win? No way,'' he said. ``We still own
the land.'' Sohappy, a leader of the Indian feather religion,
speaks of the dire consequences awaiting whites who harass Indians.
   ``They're just asking for trouble,'' he said. ``People have told
them to leave us alone. If they don't, nature will step in and make
you spend millions of dollars on weather-related things.''
   Buried in the 365-page appropriations bill for the Department of
the Interior was one paragraph directing Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan to reconsider the 21-year battle to evict Sohappy and his
family. It asks Lujan to meet with the Yakima tribe and report back
to Congress within four months. The bill still awaits the
president's signature.
   The fight over his home is just one of many Sohappy rebellions.
   Sohappy and his son David Jr. were arrested by federal and state
wildlife after an undercover sting operation called ``Salmonscam''
in 1981 and 1982. They were accused of selling 317 fish out of
season.
   The Sohappys were convicted in federal court in Los Angeles in
1983 and sentenced to five years in prison. They served 20 months
each and remain on probation.
   A Yakima Tribal Court jury in 1987 acquitted them of tribal
poaching charges. That trial, labeled ``Tradition on Trial,'' won
international attention from human rights groups.
   Some members were angry when the tribe prosecuted Sohappy in the
``Salmonscam'' case, tribal prosecutor Jack Fiander said. Others
were glad a violator of tribal fishing laws was on trial.
   The tribe for 25 years has set fishing seasons for its members
and regulated the type of equipment they could use, Fiander said.
They insisted on prosecuting Sohappy to protect tribal sovereignty
in such matters, he said.
   ``David Sohappy, like any human being, is neither all good nor
all bad,'' Fiander said. ``Sometimes, he was both.''

<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's more than one way to change a channel.
Here's a penny-pincher's guide - well, sort of - to a merry, video
Christmas for you and your loved ones:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE BIG TICKET:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   - Stereo VCR. This one piece of hardware should be as central to
your home video system as the TV tube itself. It's much more
versatile and it's the easiest purchase to justify.
   A stereo VCR converts any television into a stereo TV by
delivering its right and left audio channels to your home audio
system. It's the biggest, cheapest single improvement you can make
to a conventional TV.
   With the stereo VCR hooked up and tuned in and your good old
19-inch black-and-white Philco between the speakers, you have
stereo TV.
   It gives you much finer acoustic detail to go along with the
video image, and you'll be surprised at how much a good soundtrack
enhances your viewing.
   And there's a lot to hear: Most major TV markets have more than
one stereo broadcaster, most cable systems can deliver a stereo
signal, and most videocassettes sold and rented today are in
stereo.
   With that much programming available, it's just foolish not to
upgrade.
   When you're shopping, remember: A ``two-head'' or ``four-head''
or ``Hi-Fi'' VCR isn't necessarily a stereo model. Every VCR needs
one tape head to play and one head to record. Four-head models
allow for slow-motion, freeze frames and other special effects.
   With a stereo VCR, you also get SAP, or Secondary Audio Program
services (also known as MTS or Multi-Channel Television Sound). PBS
stations use it for descriptive narrative, weather reports and
simultaneous translation to a second language.
   Full-featured models retail for $300 to $450, but basic models
can be had for less than $250.
   - Stereo TV monitor. Here's where shopping pays. Discounters
offer stereo-ready, 25-inch TV monitors for just less than $400,
and basic 27-inch models for just more than $400. These are just
about perfect for home viewing.
   This is where belt-tightening gets tough, because the more bells
and whistles you tack on to that basic picture tube, the faster
that big ticket fattens.
   Then you find yourself paying $50 for delivery of a $2,500,
35-inch behemoth that claims to have 700 lines of resolution,
picture-in-picture, ``super-woofer'' and a microwave popcorn maker.
   Singlehandedly, you have tipped the economy into recession and
yourself into debtor's prison.
   And that bigger tube whets your appetite for that sweet, $500
LaserDisc player that has a 60 percent sharper picture, letterbox
formats, CD sound and handles audio Compact Discs - a whole new way
to spend money!
   Be strong (or at least have the decency to wait for the
after-Christmas sales).
   - Video Player. This is the biggest bargain for a budget.
Discounters offer rugged, play-only VHS machines for less than
$150. For the simple pleasure of home video viewing, they're hard
to beat.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE LESSER TICKET:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   - A decoder. Yes, that $1,500 ``Surround-Sound'' loudspeaker
system would match your living room decor, but Radio Shack sells
the basic decoder for around $130. So you find a couple of extra
speakers, hook 'em up, rent your favorite disaster movie, and strap
yourself to the couch. ... Apartment dwellers note: THIS DOES NOT
INDEMNIFY YOU FROM PLASTER DAMAGE!
   - A cassette rewinder. For about $30, you can spare the
wear-and-tear that sends most VCR and players to the shop.
   - LaserDiscs. Got a finicky videophile on your list? These
beauties sell for anywhere from $19.95 red tag specials to $200
boxed sets, although most releases retail for $30 to $35. Give 'em
``Motel Hell.'' That scene with the dueling chainsaws is high point
of 20th century cinema. Heh, heh, heh. ...
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE LOW TICKET:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   - Multiple-outlet strips. Anyone with electronic gear will
welcome one of these. At $20 to $30, a four- or six-outlet strip
feeds into a safe, heavy-duty cord and a three-prong plug.
   - Spike protector. At about $20, it can prevent a lightning bolt
from frying a home entertainment center.
   - Prerecorded cassettes. There are thousands of movies on the
home market, and you already know what movies and stars your
friends and relatives enjoy. And is there a better way to
tranquilize the kids late on Christmas Day than a movie on
cassette? Lassie, come home!
   - Blank tapes. In the history of videocassette recording, no one
ever has been known to have enough blank tapes. No one. Ever.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE LITTLEST TICKET:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   - Compressed air. A spray can of this sure beats dusting with
Lemon Pledge. - A good penlight. Fumbling in the dark for tiny
switches, wires and RCA sockets is not unlike hell.
   - Videotape labels. Quick, which is it: SIS-'N'-MOM '86, VAC`N
H'LITES '85, NATIONAL VELVET. New labels mean never having to say
you're sorry.
   Happy holidays!

   It wasn't long ago, you may recall, when the
airwaves and newspapers and books and magazines promoted the idea
of leverage, of borrowng to the limit, of using other people's
money - OPM - to succeed.
   Leverage was the way to wealth, you were told, and, if you had
doubts, the promoter of the notion could parade before you names of
some mighty successful people, such as Michael Milken and a
half-dozen local developers.
   The concept had plenty of ``can't lose'' relatives, such as,
``You can only lose pennies if you buy penny stocks,'' and,
``Anyone with common sense can make it big in commodities,'' and,
``Yes, you can outwit the stock market.''
   All such ideas have been slain by the realities. As popular
economist Howard Ruff says, among the most vicious of all crimes is
the slaughter of popular theories by brutal gangs of facts.
   Ruff, who made a name years ago by forecasting bad times, takes
a look back at the carnage wrought by some of those flighty ideas
generated by the free-loose-and-easy (floosy) 1980s. He identifies
these among the victims:
   -Stock prices will rise and rise and rise.
   Well, for a time they did. And as time grew, people became more
convinced than ever it was true. Those too young to recall earlier
bloodbaths thought they had identified new truths when they were
succumbing to old lies.
   The phrasing of those ``truths'' was very familiar. The old
rules don't apply, it was said. We're in a new era, it was
explained. Those who stuck to the old rules were viewed as
has-beens, unable to adjust to the new reality.
   -You can borrow, borrow and borrow, without every worrying about
debt. Pay back in cheaper dollars, take a tax deduction and
eventually sell your investment for a killing. Don't you know that
prices always go up?
   One of the popular self-help books of the early 1980s managed to
squeeze the entire mood of the times into its title, ``How To
Borrow Your Way To A Great Fortune Starting From Scratch.''
   It might have been possible for a time. In the early 1980s you
could profit from real estate investments but take a paper loss for
tax purposes. You could raise your rents. You could repay your
loans in cheaper dollars.
   Uncle Sam rescinded the tax benefits, and that put real estate
in the category of just another business. Then inflation was
brought to manageable levels. As the economy slowed it became more
difficult to raise rents. And finally it became impossible to find
buyers, especially at inflated prices.
   Reviewing the '80s, one of the more remarkable observations you
can make is that these and similar errors weren't made only by the
informed or by those convinced that they had discovered a quick way
to riches.
   Some of the allegedly wisest financial brains in the universe
fell for such notions - bankers, brokers, builders, insurance
executives, financial advisers, corporate officials, corporate
raiders, and not-for-profit institutions.
   And, oh yes, that profligate old rake Uncle Sam had the best
time of all. He squandered, borrowed, refinanced and borrowed more
and, for a time, had the ``experts'' convinced it was true, that
you needn't ever face the consequences.

<HEAD>Self-Appointed Executioners Prey on Guatemalan Street Children</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhotos Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pictures from a scrapbook of horrors stare
up from the table: the broken faces and bodies of street children
murdered, witnesses say, by police.
   It is the work of self-appointed executioners who impose the
death penalty for petty crimes or sniffing glue or just hanging
out. Sometimes they torture their young victims first.
   They work swiftly, unfettered by legal niceties like arrest or
trial. Due process has never quite caught on in Guatemala, which
has one of the world's worst human rights records.
   ``The people who are killing these children probably feel they
are doing good,'' said Bruce Harris, director of Casa Alianza, a
branch of the New York-based Covenant House that runs several
children's shelters in Guatemala.
   Harris showed yet another picture, of Nahaman Carmona Lopez, a
13-year-old Casa Alianza boy, on his deathbed.
   His murder began Harris' crusade to bring the killers of street
children to justice, and exposed Guatemala's ugly secret.
   ``He was the kid who had to die to bring this to our
attention,'' the first victim from a Casa Alianza shelter, Harris
said.
   Since Nahaman's death in March, Casa Alianza has filed criminal
complaints against scores of police officers. Prominent
international human rights groups have issued reports condemning
official inertia. Western diplomats have tried, without success, to
persuade the government to act.
   There has been no official comment on the murders, and no
response to Associated Press requests for an interview with police
or a statement from them.
   In most ways, Nahaman's murder was typical of the fate that has
befallen scores of rootless children in the crime-ridden streets of
Guatemala City. He just took longer to die.
   ``The police hate us,'' said William Chalin, 14, a friend of
Nahaman's who is nursing several fractured ribs from a recent
encounter.
   Five national police officers on their way to work saw Nahaman
and eight other children sniffing glue two blocks from the Casa
Alianza shelter.
   Witnesses said Nahaman resisted when police tried to pour glue
on his head, a common curbside punishment for sniffing.
   It was a fatal error.
   The officers kicked him viciously, then left him for dead, the
witnesses said. By the time an ambulance came, someone had covered
Nahaman with paper flowers and white crepe, a funeral tradition for
children in Guatemala.
   He wasn't dead, but was mortally wounded. Nahaman spent 10 days
in intensive care, regaining consciousness only long enough to tell
a Casa Alianza social worker he knew he was dying.
   Harris said the boy had bruises over 70 percent of his body, six
fractured ribs, two broken fingers, open wounds on his head and
face, a ruptured liver, brain injuries and a slash on his back.
   Casa Alianza demanded an investigation.
   President Vinicio Cerezo's human rights adviser, Eliona de
Rosario Acuna Ordonez, responded that police had ``acted on their
personal initiative and not under official orders.''
   Harris and his colleagues began gathering evidence.
   They accumulated statements from witnesses, autopsy reports,
photographs, death certificates and other material about attacks on
63 Casa Alianza children, including 13 who died. One was only 8
years old.
   So far, Casa Alianza has charges pending against 35 national
police officers, three treasury police officers, three
government-licensed private officers, a military policeman, nine
civilians and nine unidentified attackers.
   The charges range from murder and torture to abuse of authority.
Among the defendants are four of the police officers accused of
beating Nahaman.
   Casa Alianza's crusade has provoked an ugly reaction. Its
workers have been attacked and threatened. Child witnesses,
including several who saw Nahaman Carmona beaten, have been
assaulted.
   ``We got a funeral wreath the other day,'' Harris said. ``They
know who we all are and the work we are doing.''
   Mario Salazar, a Casa Alianza street worker, said police had
threatened him. ``The police see these kids as the scum of
society,'' he said. ``They tell me I am wasting my time with
them.''
   Murders of street children coincide with a crime wave of such
alarming proportions that law and order is a pivotal issue in
Guatemala's presidential campaign.
   An estimated 5,000 street children and hundreds of youth gangs
roam Guatemala City.
   ``I can understand the police being frustrated,'' Harris said.
``These kids aren't angels, but nothing excuses the organized
killing of children.''
   Amnesty International, which also has denounced Brazilian police
for murdering street children, said: ``The desire to control crime
cannot be used as an excuse for violating basic human rights,
including the right to life.''
   No one is sure how many children the street-corner executioners
have killed. Casa Alianza can act only on behalf of those in its
shelters and the authorities have yet to investigate any of the
cases.
   Powerful forces impel children into the streets.
   Many come from families in such dire poverty that 10 people
share a single room. Others are among the thousands orphaned by
political violence that has torn Guatemala for 30 years.
   ``Their lives are precarious and dangerous,'' said a recent
report by America's Watch, a human rights monitoring group based in
New York.
   ``Many of them sniff glue to alleviate their hunger. Many of
their families live on the streets. ... Others survive alone. Petty
street crime is often their only source of food or money.''
   Juan Jose Rodil, a former interior minister, said:
   ``We lack orphanages, youth homes, effective juvenile courts.
Our juvenile detention centers are centers of putrefaction that
create little monsters. But you don't cut off your head when you
have a headache.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge,'' ``Havana''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge'' currently in early stages of a stepped
release in selected markets throughout country; ``Havana'' opens in
New York on Dec. 7, in limited markets on Dec. 12 and will open
more widely Dec. 14.</NOTE>

   ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge''
   
   India Bridge can't comment about the current political situation
because her husband hasn't yet told her what to believe. She is,
you see, a woman of the 1920s, when women were expected to cook and
sew and take care of the children. And maybe play bridge.
   Walter Bridge knows what he believes in: business, Republicanism
and solid Midwestern values. He is oblivious to any of his wife's
aspirations. When his longtime secretary confesses her desperate
love for him, he responds in cool disbelief.
   Three decades in the lives of India and Walter are traced in
``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge,'' which stars Paul Newman and Joanne
Woodward in the best of their long collaboration in films. They are
marvels to watch - two Academy Award professionals employing all
their skills to bring life and shading into a pair of seemingly
humdrum characters.
   ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge'' is the 15th feature film of James Ivory
(director), Ismail Merchant (producer) and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala
(writer). Their work is unfailingly literate and meticulously
produced, a ``Masterpiece Theater'' of the big screen. This is not
a putdown; ``Masterpiece Theater'' is the single reliable oasis in
television's half-vast wasteland.
   This time the trio have chosen the much-loved novels, ``Mrs.
Bridge'' and ``Mr. Bridge'' by Evan S. Connell. There is no linear
plot. The story of a marriage is told in a series of anecdotes that
have little connection except for employing the same protagonists.
The central figure is the frustrated and confused India, born a few
generations too early.
   Woodward brings pathos to India Bridge without a hint of
pity-seeking. Newman has the more difficult job of submerging his
famed charisma into the grayish hues of the granite-like Walter.
Only an actor of his skill could preven Mr. Bridge from becoming a
bore.
   Ivory (``The Bostonians,'' ``Room With a View'') is richly
talented in evoking the spirit and the look of a bygone time and
place. He has directed an expert cast, particularly Blythe Danner
as India's free-thinking best friend, and Simon Callow as a waspish
psychiatrist. The Bridges children are well played by Robert Sean
Leonard, Margaret Welsh and Kyra Sedgwick.
   The Miramax Films release is rated PG-13, for adult situations.
Running time: 124 minutes.

   ``Havana''
   
   Havana, 1958: a time and place when rum flowed as freely as fast
bucks at the craps table, and sex was as open as a 50-foot ketch.
Americans came in wild abandon to soak up the withering spoils of
corrupt Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.
   It was the twilight of the aristocracy and the dawn of the
peasant - when the rumba met the revolutionary and more than just
the music died.
   Sydney Pollack shakes the death rattle in ``Havana,'' his
bittersweet love story of a high-rolling gambler named Jack, played
by Robert Redford, who comes to Havana for the biggest poker game
of his career, and instead falls in love with Roberta Duran (Lena
Olin), a Swedish revolutionary.
   Roberta is married to an influential aristocrat (Raul Julia) who
supports Fidel Castro and the rebel forces.
   Redford, looking like he just stepped off the set of ``The Way
We Were'' in his All-American '50s garb, arrives in Havana on the
car ferry just as Batista's thugs board the boat in search of
contraband (translation, weapons for the rebel forces). Roberta
looks mighty sweaty through it all, and an effete food writer
(Daniel Davis), who we immediately know works for The Company
(translation CIA), looks on with grand bemusement and interest.
   Roberta's car carries a cache of American-issue military weapons
and ammunition. She hires Jack to drive the car through customs
because she fears Batista's men already have her fingered (they
probably noticed the look of pure terror on her face).
   Jack, a middle-aged guy who's gone through life committed to
nothing but his one pleasures and nomad existence, is fascinated by
Roberta, a sensual, deeply committed woman - committed to her
marriage and husband and to the cause. She's everything he isn't.
   Jack is also drawn towards Arturo, Roberta's husband, who
mesmerizes with his eyes, his genteel ways. But the revolution is
meaningless for Jack, who merely follows the game wherever it might
be.
   But these are dangerous times with dangerous players. The Durans
are arrested, Arturo is believed dead, Roberta is taken off to be
tortured.

<TEXT>
   Jack's loyalties - to gambling and to his emotions - collide. He
carries his desire to save Roberta to the big game with its
selective group of heavy hitters, including the head of Batista's
security police. Jack does a no-no: He mixes politics with cards.
   But through his wits, he manages to free Roberta. He hides her
in his rooms, but she doesn't stay. The revolution can't wait.
   Cuba is falling apart as the New Year approaches. Batista is
about to flee and Castro is about to come down from the hills.
Roberta puts her life on the line and the rebels regard her as a
leader. Jack puts his life on the line to find her and spirit her
to safety in Miami, and especially by falling in love with her.
   It is the eve of success for the revolution. And here's where
the screenplay falls completely apart. A woman of such intense
commitment to such an intense cause would hardly abandon it and the
people who depend on her for a man - especially one like Jack.
   But a predictable twist shakes her back to her destiny.
   Pollack avoids the polemics of the rebel cause and aims his
camera on the decadence and brutality of the Batista regime. He's
in his Hemingway mode - the colors, the booze, the women, the
fearlessness, the intrigue, the flirtation with death and dying.
But the movie lacks any real hard edge or toughness.
   The movie ends years later. There's a voice-over as Jack gazes
out to sea in Key West, Fla., watching the sunset and the ships.
Afterall, Roberta might be on one. Another Hemingway nudge.
   Pollack is a thoughtful and intelligent director who is very
good with character development. He wins with Roberta; the jury's
still out with Jack.
   Unfortunately, there's very little sensuality between the two
stars. Redford is far too restrained and distant to add fuel to
Olin's natural fire. She is an extremely talented and passionate
actress who scorched the screen in ``Enemies, A Love Story'' and
``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' (another love story set
against the politics, confusion and death of a revolution).
   Redford is likewise a cold fish in what's supposed to be one of
the film's hot scenes and an example of the fast life in Havana: a
menage a trois with a two American tourists.
   There are touches of grim wit in ``Havana,'' provided by Alan
Arkin as the casino boss and second in command to mobster Meyer
Lansky, and by Davis as the CIA gourmand, who gives a coy exit line
about being off to write about the food in Southeast Asia.
   The streets of old Havana were replicated for the film, shot
almost entirely in the Dominican Republic. But Owen Roizman's
photography is merely pedestrian. Judith Rascoe (``Who'll Stop the
Rain,'' ``Endless Love'') wrote the screenplay.
   Produced by Pollack and Richard Roth, with Ronald L. Schwary as
executive producer, Universal Pictures' ``Havana'' is rated R.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Computers are challenging the sandbox and
easel in preschool programs across the country, although educators
have mixed opinions about introducing technology to toddlers.
   Youngsters should ``begin as early as possible to view computers
as a tool,'' said Suzanne Thouvenelle, vice president of an
Alexandria, Va., firm that developed software for young children.
   But John Lindley, principal of South Colby Elementary School in
Port Orchard, Wash., countered, ``Children need to be involved in
active learning. Computers are too passive. Computer introduction
to them is something they get too much of already and that's
television.''
   Even Bernard Gifford, vice president of education marketing for
Apple Computer Inc., acknowledged that computers in preschool may
be ``a bit too early.''
   ``I believe strongly in making it available to kids but I would
be reluctant to impose a structured program at that age. I think
the most important skills for youngsters at ages 3 and 4, frankly,
are social skills.''
   In a sampling of Head Start preschool classes around the
country, children used computers to create animals and plant
imaginary gardens. One program allowed them to combine facial
features on the computer while dictating stories to their teachers.
   The youngsters were so excited and motivated by the computers
that attendance improved, Thouvenelle said. Parents also showed a
greater interest in their children's work and enthusiastically
volunteered to work in the classroom.
   Walt Disney Computer Software, Inc. recently introduced a line
of software that had been tested at two Burbank, Calif.,
preschools. ``Nowhere on the package does it say educational
software,'' notes Sam Palahnuk, Walt Disney product developer.
``What we claim this stuff is a `fun exploratory software for your
kid.'''
   Fun is what 3-year-old Heather Leffler, 4-year-old Emily Koleini
and her 2-year-old brother Massoud were having during a
demonstration of the software at an upscale Virginia mall. With
parents nearby, the children watched in delight the colorful,
animated graphics of Mickey Mouse and his friends and listened to
the digitalized speech, fully orchestrated music and real-life
sound effects.
   The youngsters used numbers to help Mickey Mouse plan a birthday
party for Goofy, named animals at a county fair with letters of the
alphabet, and identified shapes as Mickey performed magic acts.
   ``It certainly isn't boring,'' said Andrea Fleury of McLean,
Va., as she threatened to leave her 3-year-old, who had tinkered
with the computer for nearly two hours.
   ``We went for the approach `let kids really have fun and they'll
learn as a side effect,''' said Palahnuk. ``We don't want to claim
that it's going to teach your kid anything. We think it will, but
you start getting into teaching philosophy and curriculum and all
that kind of thing.''
   A study by the National Association of Elementary School
Principals found that elementary school children are more likely to
use computers in school than high school or college students, and
even 15 percent of kindergartners and preschoolers in the public
schools use computers.
   ``Research dating back to 1932 showed that technology as simple
as a typewriter had significant effects on the reading and writing
performance of elementary students,'' said James E. Dezel,
International Business Machines Corp. vice president. ``The
technology available to schools today and in the future could bring
about amazing results.''
   IBM sponsored the three-year study exploring classroom uses of
computers with children and parents in Head Start, a popular
federal preschool program that provides education, meals and health
screening for poor youngsters aged 3 through 5.
   Eleven of Head Start's 1,300 programs participated, including
four in Baltimore, Md., and one each in Winder, Ga., DeRidder, La.,
New York City, Lexington, Ky., Toledo, Ohio, Las Cruces, N.M., and
Dayton, Ohio.
   Head Start was used ``because of its emphasis on providing
equity for kids from low-income families,'' said Thouvenelle, vice
president of Mobius Corp., which developed new software after
evaluating the program.
   She said the software meets the guidelines of the National
Association for the Education of Young Children ``as being
developmentally appropriate.'' Association officials take no
position on computers in preschool.
   ``Our major concern was whether or not computers were
applicable, or would work for preschool children 3 and 4 years
old,'' said Thouvenelle. A second concern, she said, was whether
``young children can use computers as a tool the same way they use
blocks or easel painting.''
   Each of the 44 classrooms participating in the experiment had
two computers that shared a printer, mouse and a large,
touch-sensitive device known as the Powerpad. Thouvenelle said the
Powerpad is important to young children who often do not have the
fine motor skills needed to hold a pen or pencil.
   The computers ran a program called KidsWay, which came equipped
with voice cards in the native language of the parents of the
children who participated, such as Spanish, Navajo, Swahili and
Japanese.
   A key finding, said Thouvenelle, is that computers should be
available and accessible to youngsters in the classroom, the same
as reading materials, art work, blocks, sandbox and other so-called
learning center areas. Preschoolers should not be marched down the
hall to a computer laboratory, she said.
   She said a lack of teacher training and support remains a key
drawback to the program.
   Winnie Porter, a 12-year teaching veteran of kindergarten
through fifth grade in San Francisco, is against pushing academics
too early in kindergarten. Computers, she said, ``are good as long
as kids are allowed to explore with them and they are not forced on
them.''
   ``I think children could learn what they would learn from a
computer as they would learn from other things,'' said Pat
Wynne-Evans, who retired last year as a San Francisco teacher.
   With many school districts plagued by tight budgets, Lindley,
the South Colby principal, said, ``If I had to make a financial
decision between buying big blocks for $400-$500 and a computer for
$850, I'd go with the big blocks every time.
   ``Kids need active learning. Computers are not
multi-dimensional. Also you want children using their imagination,
rather than looking at a screen,'' Lindley said.

<HEAD>Justice or Quotas? Political Parties Wrestle With a Hot Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The next presidential campaign will likely
feature a fiery debate over affirmative action. But one party will
call it simple justice, the other will label it unfair quotas and
voters will have to decide whom to believe.
   Sen. Jesse Helms rode to re-election in North Carolina after
accusing his black challenger, Democrat Harvey Gantt, of supporting
racial quotas. And while some denounced the tactic, others detected
a way to bolster the identity and electoral strength of the
Republican Party.
   ``Helms came from 13 points behind to win comfortably, I think
solely on this issue,'' said GOP consultant Roger Stone. ``It is
the kind of cutting social issue that conservatives need to hold
onto the White House.''
   A number of recent developments suggest voters may be hearing a
lot more about affirmative action and racial quotas between now and
November 1992:
   -Democratic congressional leaders have renewed their pledge to
once again pass a civil rights bill that President Bush branded a
quota bill and vetoed in the last Congress.
   -Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder, the only Democrat blatantly testing
the 1992 presidential waters, blasted Bush's characterization of
the bill and said it gave Helms phony ammunition. ``I know what
racial quotas are; I have experienced them firsthand,'' Wilder, who
is black, said in a letter to Bush.
   -William Bennett, the new Republican Party chairman, defended
Helms' use of the quota issue and said he was ready to debate
affirmative action if the Democrats bring it up. ``Most Americans
are troubled'' by racial preference programs, he said.
   -Disaffected Democrats at a conservative forum predicted doom
for their party unless more moderate voices are heard. ``Until we
give up fear and discuss these issues rationally and logically, we
are going to continue to lose,'' said former New York Mayor Ed
Koch.
   Prominent Democrats say their party has a sound position but
others have distorted it.
   ``I don't know what there is to redefine,'' said party chairman
Ron Brown, who is black. ``The Democratic Party and its chairman in
particular vehemently oppose quotas. We vehemently oppose anything
that could lead to reverse discrimination. The legislation that the
Democratic Congress sent forward to the president was not a quota
bill. It was supported by a number of conservative Republicans.''
   But the Democrats - including Gantt himself - acknowledge that
they haven't communicated well with voters, many of whom equate
affirmative action with quotas. As Stone noted, ``Harvey Gantt ran
up and down North Carolina saying he wasn't for quotas, but nobody
believed him.''
   Working against the Democrats is a feeling among some voters
that the civil rights agenda of the 1960s has been fulfilled - that
affirmative action was supposed to be temporary and small-scale and
has outlived its time.
   But Gantt said hundreds of years of discrimination cannot be
remedied in two decades. ``That's not even one generation,'' he
said. ``We need to do it, and we need to remove the stigma that
we're going to discriminate against whites or we're going to
promote blacks who aren't qualified. None of that is true.''
   Many Democrats maintain the heart of the matter is economics.
They say Republicans want to divert attention from the recession,
and the whole idea of affirmative action is more threatening now
because jobs are scarce.
   ``This issue is about a shrinking economic pie and people
thinking someone's going to give their slice to somebody else,''
said Democratic strategist Mike McCurry.
   ``You have to recast the debate to show the Republicans are
trying to peddle fear instead of a plan to get the economy going.
And you have to have an answer for the working person who fears for
his job,'' he added. ``You have to say, `my plan is to develop a
red-hot economy so we all have jobs.'''
   Republican analyst Doug Bailey thinks his party, too, should
look at the big picture. He said it would be ``a big political
mistake'' to lean heavily on affirmative action to fill the void
left by the end of the Cold War and the splintering of the GOP on
abortion and taxes.
   ``It turns off a large corps of moderate voters, Northern
suburban voters who have supported the Repulican party in the
past,'' Bailey said. ``They will not want to see a party
intentionally choose an issue, even though it may have some merit,
which divides people on racial lines.''
   However, Stone said the theme would appeal to a group that is
equally if not more important to the party - blue-collar ``Reagan
Democrats.'' And he maintained it could be pursued without the GOP
appearing to be insensitive or divisive.
   ``You can use other issues to illustrate your desire for
economic growth in the minority community,'' Stone said. ``Go out
and campaign against quotas but for enterprise zones and greater
financial assistance for minority education.''
   But the Democrats firmly believe they hold the higher ground on
civil rights and can persuade voters of that. Foreshadowing the
rhetoric to come, Wilder has accused Bush of failing to provide
moral leadership and Brown called his veto of the civil rights bill
a disgrace.
   ``He had an important choice to make,'' the party chairman said,
``and he chose the politics of Jesse Helms and David Duke rather
than the politics of Martin Luther King and Abraham Lincoln.''

   International travelers arriving at Kennedy
Airport may think the U.S. Customs inspectors checking their
luggage look a tad baby-faced - and they're right. Some are as
young as 14.
   The youths are part of the Boy Scouts of America's Explorer
program, but this group is not just interested in earning merit
badges - they're looking for drugs, weapons and counterfeit goods.
   These Explorers are involved in nearly every aspect of Customs
activities, from searching foreign cargo planes to X-raying cartons
of frozen shrimp.
   Before going out in the field, they attend classes where they
learn essentials like search, arrest and seizure techniques and how
to conduct a proper patdown. Later, they'll also perform
surveillance with agents investigating money laundering and child
pornography.
   Sunds exciting, right? Most days it is, the group insists. They
get to meet a lot of celebrities: Steve Martin and Mel Brooks among
them. But they also discover there's a downside as well.
   Like rummaging through someone's sweaty, dirty underwear. Or
sniffing the contents of a suspicious vial only to learn a dozen
sneezes too late that it's chili powder. Or being pelted with
overripe, illegal fruit by passengers who believe, ``If I can't
have it, neither can you.''
   ``Yeah, I came in here really thinking that every day was going
to be like `Miami Vice,' '' said Donald Pearce, 20, of Queens.
``Trust me, it's not.''
   The program, which began in 1984, is designed to give hands-on
experience and help participants decide if they want a career in
law enforcement, said Customs Officer Patricia Leyden, post
supervisor.
   ``It also gives them a different view of what life is like,''
she said. ``Some of them come from disadvantaged homes or
neighborhoods where kids don't grow up with the greatest dreams in
the world. This program hopefully teaches them they can do
something positive with their lives.''
   The latter is what attracted Pearce. He joined the group at 15
and is in college pursuing a degree in criminal justice.
   ``I grew up in a rapidly changing community. The crime rate was
going up. Drugs were everywhere. I could have stayed out on the
streets with my friends, but I knew where they were headed,''
Pearce said.
   ``I didn't want to be 21 with a GED and have a motorcycle be the
most important thing in my life.''
   Nationwide, some 1.1 million youths are involved in Explorer
programs that run the gamut from movie producing to medicine and
commercial art to aerospace engineering.
   Brian Archimbaud, director of Exploring for the Boy Scout
Council in New York, said the focus shifted from camping and nature
programs around 1970 after a survey showed senior Scouts wanted
career-oriented programs.
   ``They also, not surprisingly, wanted a program that had girls
in it,'' Archimbaud said.
   The 11 males and three females at the Kennedy post, who range in
age from 14 to 20, nearly blend in with their official U.S. Customs
counterparts, helping enforce the laws of 40 federal agencies.
   Only their youthful faces and trendy hairdos give them away.
Dressed in the Customs uniform of starched white shirts and blue
trousers, they politely answer travelers' questions as they look
through luggage for contraband.
   Though the Explorers haven't been in on any big busts, they have
had some small successes.
   Charles Sierra - a serious, bearded 19-year-old who refused to
smile for a photographer because he was ``on duty'' - found a
carton of guns in a shipment of luggage while working cargo
inspection.
   David Chianes - a 16-year-old nicknamed Bart because of his
Simpson-like hairdo - uncovered 40 ounces of opium inside some
hollowed tree branches while working the mailroom detail. ``They
were just regular branches, but they smelled funny,'' the youthful
sleuth said.
   And then there was ``the great mango caper,'' said Robert Nici,
19, giving a companion a high five.
   Nici, tie slightly askew, busily chomping gum, recalls how he
discovered an illegal cache of mangoes inside a Caribbean woman's
suitcase. He was the one who got pelted.
   ``You think you've got the big load here, the one that's going
to make Medellin (cartel) crumble, and it turns out to be illegal
fruit.''
   Though he made light of his big bust, Leyden gently reminded him
that he might have stopped another Mediterranean fruit fly
infestation, a fact that prompted another high five.
   Of all the jobs, the Explorers seem to like doing plane searches
best.
   ``It's the lttle kids in them,'' Leyden said. ``They get to go
in and search the electrical systems, under floors, looking for
whatever.''
   Most volunteer between 10 and 30 hours a month at the airport.
They also give anti-drug lectures at high schools and community
fairs.
   To become an Explorer, no previous Scouting experience is
necessary. Members must be between 14 and 20 and, if in high
school, maintain a C average. The mix, nationwide, is 60 percent
male and 40 percent female.
   Though the group falls under the auspices of the Boy Scouts, the
program is run through the participating agency or business.
   Archimbaud said about 60 percent of the Explorers go into some
aspect of their career posts; two former members of the JFK post
now are working as full-time Customs inspectors.
   ``The rest go off in a totally different direction,'' Archimbaud
said. ``That's one of the program's main advantages. They get to
experience different careers before they're forced to make a
serious commitment.''
   He knows firsthand the benefits of the program. His daughter was
a journalism Explorer at a Dallas newspaper.
   ``By her exposure to a newspaper, she got a real good sense of
what the career had to offer - the pluses, the drawbacks.'' Pause.
``And as a result, she's in law school today.''

<HEAD>Latin America: Dumping Ground for Toxic Wastes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD LEWAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and European companies dump
millions of tons of toxic waste in Latin America every year,
leaving poisonous residues that health officials say will endanger
lives for decades.
   Everything from household trash to radioactive sludge is sent to
the region because lax anti-pollution laws make disposal easier and
cheaper.
   Waste exporters say they are doing nothing wrong, but
environmentalists claim Latin Americans are not being told the full
story behind the toxic garbage they receive.
   Scientists in Brazil say the toxic waste, dumped haphazardly in
rivers, marshlands or earth wells since the late 1960s, causes
cancers, birth defects, nerve damage and blood disorders.
   ``This is an illicit trade, shrouded in secrecy and often done
by small unregistered companies, that is devastating the
environment and will affect generations to come,'' said Dr. Anthony
Wong, president of the Brazilian Society of Toxicology and director
of the Sao Paulo Poison Control Center.
   No precise figures are available for Latin America, but Mostafa
Tolla, director of the U.N. Environmental Program, estimates that
40 million tons of toxic waste entered the Third World in 1989.
   The United States, which generates 275 million tons of hazardous
garbage a year, is the world's leading waste exporter.
   American companies wanting to export hazardous waste must tell
the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Such notifications rose from 12 in 1980 to 626 in 1989. A
growing share of the waste went to Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and
the Caribbean, according to EPA documents.
   ``Latin America is a perfect dumping ground,'' said Rubens Born,
director in Brazil for Greenpeace, the international environmental
group. ``There's lots of space, loads of corrupt inspectors and
widespread ignorance of the problem.''
   Waste exporters say wastes are tightly monitored by the EPA and
shipments could not leave the United States if they contained
dangerous levels of toxins. They also say the disposal methods they
practice in foreign countries are comparable to those in the United
States.
   Latin health officials argue that poorly paid, ill-equipped port
inspectors are easily bribed to sign consent forms for importing
hazardous waste or to look the other way when cargoes are disposed
of illegally.
   U.S. law says foreign countries must be notified about waste
shipments, but many Latin governments complain about the quality of
the information.
   ``The information we receive from the U.S. EPA is grossly
misleading,'' said Dr. Waldemar F. Almeida, head of Brazil's
National Institute of Health Quality Control. ``We are rarely
informed of the quantity, the type of waste or its destination.''
   Wendy Grieder, director of the EPA's international office in
Washington, responded in a telephone interview:
   ``Waste is shipped with the understanding of all countries
involved. Latin countries are told through our embassies what kind
of waste they are getting, how much and the point of exit and
entry.''
   A 1988 report by the EPA inspector general said, however, that
the agency did not know how much waste was shipped abroad or which
exporters failed to comply with requirements for notification of
intent.
   Foreign firms often approach debt-ridden Latin governments with
offers of public works projects or increased investment in return
for permission to dump waste.
   In 1988, a New York company offered to build schools, hospitals
and roads in San Clemente, Peru, in return for the right to dispose
of incinerator ash near the city. After public protests, Peruvian
officials rejected the offer.
   On July 7, 1989, the Summit Cement and Development Corp. asked
the Bahamas government for permission to blend 88,000 tons a year
of hazardous solvents with prime fuels to fire cement kilns on
Grand Bahama Island, according to company documents.
   In return, Summit promised to create 180 jobs and give $4.5
million to the Caribbean island. The government turned the offer
down.
   ``Hazardous wastes would have been unloaded and burned 50 yards
from where cruise ships dock in the harbor,'' said Edward St.
George, chairman of the Bahamas Port Authority. ``For a few jobs,
we would have polluted the island and severely damaged our
reputation with tourists.''
   The Associated Press telephoned several times to the office of
the company owner, Finn Moller, in Alhambra, Calif. His secretary
said he would have no comment.
   Chile, Argentina, Guatemala and Bolivia have received offers
from U.S. and European companies to build incinerators and dump
sites for foreign waste, government officials of those countries
told the AP. All offers were refused.
   Jim Vallette, a Greenpeace coordinator in Washington, D.C.,
said: ``These governments have so far resisted pressure to enter
potentially lucrative dumping contracts because nationalists will
accuse them of pandering to Uncle Sam's interests.''
   Environmentalists say the cash offers are tempting for Latin
American governments, which have a combined foreign debt of more
than $400 billion.
   ``We are being forced to choose between poverty and poison,''
said Juan Shroder, founder of the environmental group Earth Alert
in Buenos Aires.
   Some waste is intended for use in development projects.
   In January, International Energy Resources Inc. of Greenwich,
Conn., offered to underwrite the cost of resurfacing 400 miles of
roads in Guatemala with 5.5 million tons of ash from U.S. municipal
incinerators.
   The government backed out after Greenpeace told Guatemalan
authorities the ash contained dangerous levels of arsenic, cadmium
and mercury.
   Douglas Berardo, president of the company, said the chemicals
did not pose a health or ecological threat because the ash had been
``washed,'' and what toxicity remained would be immobilized when
the ash was mixed with concrete.
   ``Everything was done according to the EPA's specifications,''
he said by telephone from Greenwich. ``This ash is clean.''
   He said Venezuela, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and San
Andres Island in Colombia had refused similar deals.
   Several European and U.S. scrap suppliers have mixed toxic
sludge with ordinary metals meant to be recycled by Latin American
industries.
   Last year, Greenpeace complained about a shipment of 430 metric
tons of toxic zinc residues from Belgium, Italy and Denmark to
Brazil's Produquimica Co., said Eduardo San Martin, pollution
control director of Sao Paulo state.
   Brazilian environmental officials found the residue to contain
dangerously high levels of lead, mercury, cadmium and PCBs that
Produquimica was unequipped to handle and the waste was sent back,
San Martin said. Greenpeace blocked a second shipment of 1,000 tons
of tainted zinc residue.
   To sidestep controls, some foreign-owned multinationals ship
wastes to subsidiaries in Latin countries.
   In 1978, dioxanes and benzene produced by foreign multinationals
abroad were buried in earth wells in the Samarita district of
Cubatao in southern Brazil, said Wong, director of the Sao Paulo
center.
   Housing was built on the well sites several years later and
dozens of residents suffered blood disorders, such as sickle cell
anemia and leukemia, because of the toxins, said a report by Sao
Paulo state health officials.
   In 1989, Mexican health officials in Ciudad Juarez said scores
of children sniffed glowing toxic waste dumped by a
``maquiladora,'' one of more than 1,000 U.S.-owned assembly plants
on the Mexican side of the border. They said the waste could cause
infertility, genetic damage and organ and brain lesions.
   A study of seven border cities by the Colegio de la Frontera
Norte, a Mexican think tank, said maquiladoras were contaminating
the water table and contributing to cancer, congenital defects and
nervous system damage.
   Chile, Argentina and Paraguay are drafting laws to prohibit
waste imports. Brazil restricted imports of scrap metal imports on
Aug. 1.

   If ever a man has had his sense of humor put
to the test, it's Robert Polhill.
   First, he's held hostage by Lebanese extremists more than three
years and, being diabetic, must find a way to get daily insulin
from captors who don't speak his language.
   Then, when the former Beirut University College lecturer is
released, he learns he has throat cancer and must have his voice
box removed.
   Now Polhill, at 56, is without a job, breathing through a hole
in his neck and trying to get people to understand him through a
fatiguing process called esophageal speech.
   Still, the one-liners keep coming.
   ``I'll talk again,'' he wrote on a yellow pad. ``But I'm a
realist, too. I'll never have another hit record.''
   Polhill was taken hostage Jan. 24, 1987, and freed last April
22. Three and a half weeks later, doctors at Walter Reed Hospital
removed his larynx. A short time later, he and his wife moved into
a hospital apartment near the speech clinic where he gets therapy
twice a day.
   ``He's an A-plus student,'' said Prof. William T. Simpkins Jr.
``He made a sound the first month after surgery. At four months,
he's where many people are at six months.''
   Polhill said that for 39 years, including his days as a hostage,
he smoked up to four packs of cigarettes a day. More than 90
percent of the 25,000 people who require the surgery were heavy
smokers, Simpkins said.
   ``He was always smoking,'' said Polhill's wife, Ferial. ``He got
up in the middle of the night to smoke.''
   Polhill can't smoke anymore, because he no longer can breathe
through his nose and mouth.
   He talks by capturing air between his tongue and teeth and
compressing it to create sounds. That, and note-writing, are the
ways he answers questions.
   Laryngectomy patients who perfect this esophageal speech sound
like normal talkers with headcolds, Simpkins said.
   Polhill said he rejected the electronic device preferred by some
throat-cancer victims because ``you sound like you are trying out
for `Star Wars.' ''
   Tall and slim, Polhill is generally low-key, bantering playfully
with his wife and cracking jokes with visitors. When he tires of
talking, he reaches for his pencil and pad and keeps the
conversation going in neat, precise print.
   He bristled only once, when he was asked if losing his voice was
worse than being a hostage.
   ``To me there is no comparison to being chained to the floor,''
he said. ``You couldn't even get up to go to the bathroom.''
   When Polhill was released, he was quoted as saying he ``strived
to continue to be angry'' as a means of coping with captivity.
   Later, he said he was angry at being a captive, but not consumed
by it.
   ``The point was that anger is a great energizer,'' he said.
``Then you use humor to tone it down and rechannel it more
productively.
   ``I guess I've always been able to laugh at myself,'' said
Polhill. ``I didn't have the psychological problems I was expected
to have.''
   He said a State Department psychiatrist was assigned to him at
Damascus immediately after he was released. But by the time they
reached Wiesbaden, Germany, the two men were friends, not doctor
and patient.
   ``They warned me that he would go into a depression,'' Ferial
Polhill said. ``But I said, `I don't think so.' ''
   Polhill's plans for the future are vague. A certified public
accountant, he said he's too out of date to step right back into an
accounting job.
   ``All of my energy to date has been devoted to the return to
freedom, recovery from cancer and learning to talk,'' he said.
   His medical bills and living arrangements have been handled by
the government since his release, though he knows Uncle Sam's
generosity won't go on forever.
   ``I'd like to write. I'd like to speak and teach again,'' he
said. He also said he would like to help diabetics, throat cancer
patients and hostages and their families.
   Ferial Polhill, who is Palestinian and fluent in Arabic, English
and French, is ready to go back to work. She and Robert met in
Cyprus when she was an office manager at the international
accounting firm for which he worked. An openly affectionate couple,
they've been married for 10 years.
   They will move wherever there is a job opportunity, Polhill
said, but he would like to stay in the United States.
   Meanwhile, the couple's social life has included functions
arranged by No Greater Love, a non-profit organizations that helps
hostages and their families, and the American Diabetes Association,
which published Polhill's account of how he coped with his diabetes
as a captive.
   In the association's Forecast magazine, he wrote about how he
and another diabetic hostage took care of each other and
communicated their needs to their captors. Otherwise, he declines
to give extensive details about his 1,182 days as a captive.
   ``I have a responsibility to those still there,'' he said.
``I've made my recommendations directly to the man who can do
something. I have no public recommendations to make.''
   He said President Bush listened intently and took notes when
they met shortly after Polhill was released.
   Ferial Polhill said if her husband wants to discuss his days as
a hostage, she's there to listen, but she doesn't ask questions and
doesn't feel a need to know the details.
   ``Thinking about it doesn't bother me,'' said Polhill. ``But
does the world need to know?''
   While Polhill was a captive, Ferial stayed on in Beirut, the
city where she grew up, trying to find her husband. She left only
when fighting became intolerable, but returned later and was in
Beirut when Robert was released.
   She said people have been surprised at how easily the couple has
adjusted to being together again after the long ordeal.
   ``It's as if we were stepping back in time,'' she said. ``We
fell back into our lives as if nothing had happened.''
   She said her friends have asked her how her husband hollers at
her now that he has no voice box.
   ``I say, `His writing gets very messy','' she said.
   ``That's what's depressing,'' joked Polhill. ``I can't shout at
her anymore.''

   After 44 months of blindfolds and bonds, of
arsenic and aches, former hostage Frank Reed is trying to find his
place in the world.
   It hasn't been easy. Jobless and living in a furnished
apartment, homecoming for Reed has been pleasure fused with pain
this fall. There have been holidays and birthdays, football games
and homecomings, reunions with old friends, and a sentimental
journey into the past to review his life.
   But what Reed has found since he was freed by his Shiite Moslem
kidnappers in Lebanon on April 30 is that he is not the same man,
that things are not the same, that life is getting shorter.
   ``The healing process takes time,'' he said. ``I'm trying to
find out who I am, what America is, how do I fit into all of these
things, where do I belong, where should I live, how am I going to
pay the rent over the rest of my life.
   ``One of the problems about hostaging is you become very
self-centered because your major concern is yourself,'' he said.
``And I brought that out with me. ... I'm certainly a hell of a lot
happier. But am I enjoying contentment and happiness? No. I'm not
there yet.''
   A triplet whose Siamese-twin sisters died shortly after birth,
Frank Reed was a born survivor. Now he is trying to survive again,
trying to complete his reentry into the world.
   He has launched a movement he calls ``Hostagepeace'' to work for
the release of 13 Westerners still held in Lebanon. Most of them
are believed in the hands of Shiite factions belonging to the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Reed calls them ``our boys,'' distinguishing his generation of
hostages from new ones held by Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait
last August. He has taken his movement to college campuses across
the country on a lecture circuit that has been providing his only
income.
   He talks often of friends left behind, among them six Americans,
including Terry Anderson, 43, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, and Thomas Sutherland, 59, acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut. They are in their
sixth year of captivity, the longest-held hostages.
   Reed, who turned 58 last Monday, lost his school and his
property in Lebanon. He spent 11 weeks in a hospital after his
release. Doctors found arsenic in his system. His weight dropped to
131 pounds. He talks of beatings and of months blindfolded in
solitary confinement for twice trying to escape.
   Fifi Reed, his Syrian-born wife 20 years his junior, said the
husband who stepped out of captivity is not the giving, kind man
she met and married in 1977. She was in teacher training at the
Lebanese International School he founded and directed. He became a
Moslem before marrying her.
   Today, some of the romantic luster has given way to the reality
of starting anew.
   Mrs. Reed, who moved to the United States in 1989 and works at a
Boston insurance firm, helps support the family. She and son Tarek
lived in an apartment with Reed's mother, Leota Sprague, during the
last year of her husband's captivity.
   ``I'm coming out of Lebanon with nothing,'' Reed said. ``What
I've left behind is the school, the income and the property that I
owned.''
   Mrs. Reed said they are struggling financially. ``Every now and
then I have to resort to my parents, as usual,'' she said, ``but it
is a struggle.''
   Publicly, Frank Reed is adjusting much better than expected, his
wife said. He's negotiating for a book and a movie and hopes to
complete his Ph.D. in education at Boston College. He is healthy
again, the arsenic flushed from his body, his weight back up to 176
pounds.
   ``Privately, it's a bit hard,'' Mrs. Reed said. ``I expected
that and I'm facing it. A lot of Frank was a very spontaneous,
naturally giving kind of person. Right now, I don't see that.''
   Tarek turned 10 in November. Reed had missed the boy's past four
birthdays. On Thanksgiving Day, Reed went to the Malden High School
football game with old friends, then sat down to dinner with his
mother and his older brother for the first time in more than a
dozen years.
   They all gave thanks that he is alive and that they were
together this year. ``Not only that, I might not be here another
year,'' said his mother, Mrs. Sprague, who will be 92 in February.
   ``I'm giving thanks that we're all together, that I'm free,''
Reed said that day. ``But I will never be free until the others
are. I pray for the others.''

   Two men, both held hostage in Lebanon. Two men, now free,
dealing with their ordeal in different ways. Robert Polhill,
released after three years, hasn't lost his sense of humor, despite
his battle with throat cancer. Frank Reed, held 44 months in

   Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., the remnants
of Frank Lorenzo's Texas Air Corp. empire, filed for bankruptcy
court protection from creditors, saying it was overwhelmed by a
heavy debt load and surging fuel prices.
   The company, parent of Continental Airlines Inc., filed its
Chapter 11 petition Monday in Wilmington, Del., where it is
incorporated. The filing is the second time in seven years
Continental has sought to reorganize.
   The filing didn't affect any operations or schedules among the
88 U.S. cities and 55 international destinations Continental serves
with a fleet of more than 300 planes.

   NEW YORK (AP) - AT&amp;T said its proposed $6 billion buyout of NCR
Corp. would create a worldwide computing powerhouse, but the
chairman of the nation's fifth-largest computer maker said he's not
interested.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said Monday that it first
approached NCR about a buyout Nov. 15, and that the two companies
held talks on the offer since.
   Though AT&amp;T described its stock-swap bid announced Sunday as
friendly, NCR Chairman Charles E. Exley Jr. said AT&amp;T's decision to
disclose the talks made the $90-a-share proposal hostile.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Business continued to slow at the nation's
industrial companies in November, extending a decline that is
likely to continue for some time, the National Association of
Purchasing Management said.
   The purchasing managers said Monday that production and new
orders both dropped, pushing the group's index of economic activity
down to 41.3 percent from 43.4 percent in October.
   Private economists predicted the downturn will continue until
interest rates fall and the Middle East crisis is resolved.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Consumers continued to pay their bills in the
July-September quarter but were scaling back borrowing as the
economy headed into what many analysts say is a recession, a
banking group said.
   The percentage of consumer loans 30 or more days delinquent was
a seasonally adjusted 2.56 percent at the end of the third quarter,
virtually unchanged from the 2.55 percent rate at the end of the
April-June period, the American Bankers Association said Monday.
   The rate was 2.46 percent at the end of the first quarter and
2.64 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 1989.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Negotiations to complete an
unprecedented global free trade pact opened in turmoil as delegates
inside the hall clashed on farm issues while police outside battled
angry demonstrators.
   Almost 30,000 farmers marched Monday to protest a U.S.-backed
proposal aimed at trimming billions of dollars in trade-distorting
agricultural subsidies. Police at one point used tear gas and water
cannons.
   The talks involve 107 member nations in an effort to rewrite the
constitution of world trade, a document known as the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Businesses facing lawsuits over pensions
received some protection from the Supreme Court as the justices
ruled workers cannot sue in state courts on grounds they were fired
so their employers would not have to pay pension benefits.
   The court ruled unanimously Monday that state suits are
pre-empted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
which is aimed at assuring that workers get their retirement pay.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A smell can be registered as a trademark just

   The office Monday approved registration of the scent of a type
of embroidery yarn and sewing thread produced by Clarke's OSEWEZ
(pronounced ``Oh Sew Easy'') of Goleta, Calif.

   PITTSBURGH (AP) - Westinghouse Electric Corp. said 600 employees
in its energy systems business unit will lose their jobs at the end
of the year.
   The company said Monday the reduction, which involves 300
layoffs and 300 voluntary retirements, is necessary to strengthen
Westinghouse's competitive position in the commercial nuclear power
market in the United States and abroad.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush administration predicted in a report
to Congress that the U.S. trade deficit would remain steady even
though Americans are paying sharply more for imported oil.
   Prepared by the Treasury Department as a requirement of the 1988
trade law, the report Monday also indicated that a further decline
in the value of the dollar was not needed to improve the nation's
trade balance.
   The deficit has dropped from a peak of $162 billion in 1987 to
$129 billion in 1988 and $110 billion in 1989. During the first six
months of 1990, it ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $87
billion.

   Jerry Hammond, executive secretary-treasurer of the Kentucky
State Building &amp; Construction Trades Council, said Monday the study
will focus first on Japanese investment in the region's auto
industry because of the investments by Toyota, Nissan, Mazda,
Mitsubishi, Honda and Subaru-Isuzu.

   The bankruptcy court filing by Continental
Airlines leaves an empire built by ousted chairman Frank Lorenzo in
disarray, but the carrier says it will continue flying while it
tries to reorganize.
   The nation's fifth-largest airline blamed $2.2 billion in debt
and increased jet fuel costs due to the Persian Gulf crisis for
Monday's decision to seek protection from creditors under Chapter
11 of federal bankruptcy laws.
   Continental said the move did not affect any of about 1,400
flights Monday. The airline serves 88 U.S. cities and 55
international destinations with more than 300 planes. Its main hubs
are in Newark, N.J., Houston and Denver, and the airline is
building up a fourth hub in Cleveland.
   Management sought to reassure the airline's passengers and
37,000 employees the carrier planned to emerge from bankruptcy
court as an operating entity. The airline would fly its normal
schedule and honor contracts with travel agents and other airlines.
   ``We are confident that there will be no need for layoffs, pay
cuts or reductions in benefits,'' said Hollis Harris, chairman of
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., the airline's parent, which
also filed for Chapter 11.
   The move, though, leaves in tatters an empire crafted by Lorenzo
from a hodgepodge of carriers including Eastern Airlines, People
Express and Frontier and its huge debt is a legacy of its growth
during the 1980s.
   Subsidiary Eastern is struggling as it seeks to reorganize after
filing for bankruptcy protection in 1989, Lorenzo was ousted as
chairman earlier this year and his Texas Air Corp. was renamed.
   The trip to bankruptcy court was the second in seven years by
Continental, which filed in 1983 amid a bitter labor dispute with
the airline's union. Under Chapter 11, a company gets a reprieve
from debts while it figures out how to pay bills and tries to
reorganize as a healthy business.
   ``This is not a bankruptcy as was Continental's in 1983 or
Eastern's last year,'' Continental's general counsel, Charles T.
Goolsbee, said. ``Remember, those airlines shut down. ... We are
doing none of that. This is absolutely a business-as-usual
program.''
   Some analysts said Continental may have a relatively smooth ride
through bankruptcy court, but recent shakeouts in the industry and
the uncertainty of the Middle East situation remain troubling.
   ``It's still a strong airline,'' said Raymond Neidl, an analyst
with Dillon Read &amp; Co., a Wall Street investment firm. ``They've
got good hubs and fairly cheap operating costs. They want to hold
onto most of these assets. In the long term, that could be good.''
   Continental said it had agreed to sell its Seattle-Tacoma to
Tokyo route to American Airlines for $150 million, pending
bankruptcy court approval. The route sale is to be concluded at the
end of 1991, but $140 million of the sale price is expected to be
advanced to Continental before the deal closes.
   As part of the sale, Continental withdrew its other
international routes from the market. Last month, Continental put
those up for sale instead of seeking bankruptcy protection.
   Continental has about $2.2 billion in outstanding debt, about
$1.7 billion of which is secured. It also has nearly $4 billion in
aircraft operating losses.
   Harris said the airline is spending an extra $70 million a month
on jet fuel because of a sharp rise since Iraq invaded Kuwait in
August. Prices more than doubled from about 57 cents in July to
$1.28 in mid-October before falling back in recent weeks.
   Continental now is paying $1.07 per gallon. In addition, the
airline has increased passenger fares 15 percent in recent months,
but spokesman Ned Walker said the hikes ``come nowhere near to
recovering our fuel costs.''
   Continental lost $88.3 million in the third quarter of this
year, compared to a loss of $158 million in 1989. For the first
nine months, losses totaled $97 million, compared with $523 million
in the same period a year ago.
   Rising jet fuel costs have affected other airlines, but none had
filed for Chapter 11 before Continental.
   Earlier this fall, Pan Am Corp. announced it would sell five
prized London routes to UAL Corp., the parent of United, in a $400
million deal. In addition, airlines have laid of thousands of
workers and some plan to cut capacities.

   Not everyone views this week's trade
talks as a key to economic prosperity. Some Third World activists
see them fostering more hunger, foreign economic dominance and
pressure for lucrative drug cultivation.
   The focus at the main conference center here was a brewing
crisis over foreign agriculture subsidies that threatened the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - GATT - talks on reforming
the rules of the world trading system.
   In an adjacent hotel, a diverse collection of environmentalists,
leftists, workers for non-governmental organizations, activists and
others labeled the negotiations a ``GATTastrophe.''
   ``GATT will have very grave consequences on the environment,''
said Belgian researcher Myrian Vander Stichele, reporting the
conclusion of a week-long alternative Conference of Civil
Associations for Development.
   ``GATT doesn't deal with development or issues that matter to
people in the Third World,'' she told a news conference.
   Diplomats and trade ministers from nearly 100 countries,
including many in the Third World, at the GATT talks say new rules
to expand world trade will benefit people in developing countries
as well as prosperous nations.
   The main roadblock at the talks was a U.S. demand that the
European Community and Japan stop heavy subsidies of agriculture
and permit breakthroughs in regulating new areas. The talks opened
Monday.
   Panelists from non-governmental organizations in the
Philippines, Peru, Senegal and Japan at the alternative conference
said the end of argiculture subsidies would have dire effects in
some nations.
   ``If the United States wants to combat drugs, Third World
farmers shouldn't be stopping production'  of normal crops, said
Manuel Lajo, a Peruvian economist.
   Lajo said developing nations fear the end of farm subsidies in
wealthy nations will distort farm activity in poorer countries and
may lead to more cultivation of coca, the raw material for cocaine.
   ``The relation between coca production and farm prices is very
strong,'' Lajo said.
   Amadou Kanoute of Senegal challenged the GATT aim of extending
free-trade rules to agriculture. ``Food security is an elemental
right of each nation,'' he said.
   Kanoute, who was in Brussels as a representative of
Environmental Development Action in the Third World, said 25
percent of people in Senegal suffer malnutrition and changing GATT
rules will not help develop small farmers.
   Teresita Oliveros of Manila, representing interests of peasant
women in the Philippines, said international trade rules were
unbalanced in favor of rich countries and powerful transnational
companies.
   ``Powerful nations are imposing their rules on us, especially
the United States and Japan,'' she said.
   In her ironic description of the rules, Americans and Filipinos
have equal rights to go to each other's country and exploit
resources, but only Americans are able to do so.
   ``In the game of wealthy and powerful nations, the poor farmers,
peasants and fisherfolk are sent to the margins,'' Ms. Oliveros
said.
   Mika Eba of Japan represented a range of consumer, farming and
environmental groups. She said the U.S. demand to open Japan's
closed rice market would damage the Japanese environment and
backfire on Washington, because Japanese probably would buy cheaper
rice from Thailand, not American rice.
   Humberto Campodonica Sanchez, a teacher at San Marcos University
in Lima, Peru, said the GATT goal of extending free-trade rules to
services will harm infant industries in developing countries.
   For instance, he said, if a French bank was blocked from
expanding in Bolivia, Paris could threaten to block exports of tin
and wool that are Bolivia's lifeline. ``It's like a lion playing
with an ant,'' Campodonica said.
   He also attacked a plan to ban developing countries from
imposing conditions on foreign investments, such as requiring a
certain percentage of local parts or foreign exchange limits.
   The plan does not account for advantages foreign companies
receive in lower-paid workers in the Third World, Campodonica said.

   Here are key events in the evolution of Continental Airlines
Holdings Inc., formerly known as Texas Air Corp., which filed for
protection from creditors Monday under Chapter 11 of federal
bankruptcy laws.
   1934 - Varney Speed lines is formed in El Paso, Texas, with four
Lockheed Vega aircraft flying round trips to Denver. Earnings in
the first two weeks total $261.69 from nine paying customers.
   1937 - Varney is renamed Continental Airlines. Its eight
employees relocate to Denver.
   1968 - Continental opens routes to the South Pacific.
   1972 - Airline entrepreneur Frank Lorenzo, future boss of
Continental, acquires Texas International Airlines.
   1976 - Texas International offers ``Peanut Fares,'' the
precursor to the discount fares that would spread throughout the
industry after deregulation in 1978.
   1980 - Lorenzo creates Texas Air Corp., parent of Texas
International, headquartered in Houston.
   1981 - Texas Air gains control of Continental Airlines.
   1983 - Continental employees strike, accusing Lorenzo of unfair
tactics to drive down costs. The airline, losing $1 million a day,
files for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws. Employment drops from more than 12,000 a year
earlier to 4,000.
   1984 - Using nonstrikers and new hires, Continental resurrects
much of its pre-strike operations. Lorenzo builds reputation as
anti-union manager.
   1985 - Continental begins first European service. Lorenzo loses
a bid to buy Trans World Airlines as its employees, fearing his
union hostility, support takeover by investor Carl Icahn.
   1986 - Continental re-emerges from bankruptcy with a plan to
fully repay all debts. Employment reaches 14,500 and aircraft fleet
totals 200, double the pre-bankruptcy level. Parent Texas Air
acquires Eastern Airlines as well as remnants of People Express and
Frontier, making it the largest airline operator in the country
with 20 percent of the market.
   1987 - Continental's employment reaches 24,500 and fleet totals
more than 300 jets serving 140 destinations. Lorenzo introduces
``Maxsaver'' discount fares and announces plans to cut labor costs
at Eastern.
   1988 - Texas Air undertakes joint venture with Scandinavian
Airline System, the beginning of a growing relationship between the
two companies. Texas Air also shows the effects of fare-cutting and
debt-financed spending spree, losing $466.2 million in 1987 vs.
earnings of $72.7 million a year earlier.
   1989 - Lorenzo rejects Eastern union demands in contract
negotiations, workers strike, Texas Air puts Eastern under
bankruptcy-court protection and begins to sell many of its assets.
Parent company loses $885.6 million for the year, an industry
record. Lorenzo insists he'll remain in the airline business
despite speculation he might get out.
   January-February 1990 - Texas Air drastically reduces proposal
for repaying Eastern creditors and faces increased trouble in
bankruptcy court.
   April 1990 - Lorenzo loses control of Eastern to court-appointed
trustee. Texas Air is renamed Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.
   August 1990 - Lorenzo resigns as chairman and chief executive
and sells most of his Continental holdings to Scandinavian Airlines
System. He remains a board member.
   November 1990 - Continental denies speculation it will file for
bankruptcy but concedes the board considered the move. Airline puts
some prized routes up for sale to raise cash. Lorenzo predicts that
trouble in the airline industry could leave just three or four
carriers dominating within a few years.
   Dec. 3, 1990 - Continental files for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws, blaming the move on
excessive debt and high fuel costs.

   The success of Continental Airlines' decision to
file for bankruptcy court protection might depend on how long tough
times linger in an industry ravaged by high fuel costs and a
sinking economy, analysts say.
   Passengers should see no changes in Continental's service as the
Houston-based carrier buys time and holds creditors at bay - for
now anyway. But analysts said the strategy depends on outside
factors changing.
   ``They're trying to hold the thing together as much as possible
and try to wait it out,'' said Thomas Canning at Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp., a leading debt-rating agency. ``It could work, provided this
recession is not too prolonged and too deep.''
   If on the other hand Continental and other weak airlines
continue bleeding and even go out of business, financially powerful
airlines such as American and United will be in a much better
position. That could mean, for example, fewer fare discounts and
even some big fare increases as competition declines.
   Even as Continental announced the Chapter 11 filing Monday, it
said it was selling a prized Seattle-Tokyo route to American for
$150 million. The move seemed to affirm the view of analysts who
have said the Persian Gulf crisis is serving as a catalyst to speed
industry shakeups.
   The bankruptcy filing ``appeared to have been necessary because
of a liquidity crisis where assets could not be sold in a good time
frame,'' said Raymond Neidl, an analyst with Dillon Read &amp; Co.
   The other major airline in bankruptcy court is Eastern, a
Continental subsidiary. It ran into life-threatening troubles this
fall when unsecured creditors asked a bankruptcy judge to order a
liquidation, saying Eastern has no chance of a healthy recovery.
   But last week, Eastern's court-appointed trustee Martin R.
Shugrue Jr. persuaded a bankruptcy judge to give Eastern up to $135
million from an escrow fund. Shugrue said the cash will keep
Eastern alive through March, and after that he believes the airline
can stop losing money.
   Analysts don't believe it will be that simple. But they say
Eastern's experience shows that an airline can stay alive in
bankruptcy court indefinitely.
   ``As we've seen them with the Eastern bankruptcy, the airline
under the protection of Chapter 11, can continue as a very
effective competitor,'' said Bruce Thorp, airline analyst with
Provident National Bank in Philadelphia.
   ``In fact, Eastern's presence is very much felt by competitors
such as Delta,'' he said. ``The important point here is going into
Chapter 11 does not take you out of business by any means.''
   Still, the uncertainties posed by the Persian Gulf crisis and
the slow economy will remain big obstacles.
   Airlines have all been hit hard by the jump in jet fuel prices
that came after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, throwing world oil
markets into chaos.
   Coupled with sluggish demand for air travel, the airline
industry has been limping toward its worst year ever, with losses
estimated at more than $1 billion.
   Seeral weeks ago, Continental had considered the bankruptcy
option, but it decided at the time to try and avoid it. Apparently,
the carrier was unable to make any other options work for the
immediate future, analysts said.
   ``I don't see Chapter 11 as any panacea,'' Thorp said. ``I think
it holds creditors at bay. It's a buying of time more than
anything.''

   NCR Corp. says it will fight to retain its
independence, but industry analysts said any defensive move to ward
off AT&amp;T's $6 billion takeover bid would prove costly.
   AT&amp;T said Monday its proposed buyout of the nation's
fifth-largest computer maker would create a worldwide computing
powerhouse. NCR said it isn't interested.
   ``Our position consistently has been that this doesn't make
business sense,'' NCR Chairman Charles E. Exley Jr. said. ``I don't
see what it would add to the NCR system. We want them to go away.''
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., which announced the
stock-swap bid Sunday, said it first approached NCR about a buyout
Nov. 15, and that the two companies held talks on the offer since.
   Though AT&amp;T described its bid as friendly, Exley said AT&amp;T's
decision to disclose the talks made the $90-a-share proposal
hostile.
   ``If this is their idea of a friendly takeover, they must look
like Attila the Hun when they're feeling unfriendly,'' he said at a
news conference at NCR headquarters in Dayton, Ohio.
   AT&amp;T's decision to make the discussions public puts pressure on
NCR by letting NCR shareholders know of the deal - the $90-a-share
bid represents a 60 percent premium over NCR's stock price Friday.
   NCR shares shot up $24.75 to close at $81.50 Monday as 5 million
shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, making it the
second most actively traded issue behind AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T fell $2 a share
to $30.12{, with 8.5 million shares traded. AT&amp;T is the nation's
most widely held stock.
   AT&amp;T said its offer remained open until the end of business
Wednesday. If NCR does not accept by then, AT&amp;T may make a tender
offer directly to NCR stockholders, AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen
said.
   Several industry analysts viewed AT&amp;T's talk of a tender offer
as a tactic to get NCR to agree to a negotiated deal. Rick Martin
of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said NCR had several options if
it chose to fight AT&amp;T's bid, all costly.
   One would be a leveraged buyout, in which NCR would borrow money
to buy back its shares and go private. A second would be to buy
another computer company to make itself less attractive, Martin
said.
   NCR also could seek a ``white knight,'' a third company that
would buy NCR to save it from AT&amp;T. But Martin said it would be
difficult to find a better suitor than AT&amp;T in the computer
industry.
   Exley said in the interview that NCR was exploring ``all the
available alternatives'' to fight an AT&amp;T takeover. He also said
the company was contacted by other potential suitors since rumors
of an AT&amp;T bid appeared in the press early last month.
   ``We made no response to any of them,'' he said. ``We're not
interested in being acquired by anybody.''
   In a strongly worded letter Monday to Allen released by NCR,
Exley said AT&amp;T had ``resorted to the pressure takeover tactics of
the 1980s - actions more suited to a corporate raider than a
responsible corporate citizen.''
   He said AT&amp;T had exaggerated the length and nature of the
companies' conversations, and had damaged the market value of both
companies. He said Monday's stock activity had erased $2 billion
from AT&amp;T's market value while adding $1.6 billion to NCR's.
   In a letter last week, released by AT&amp;T, Exley said NCR would be
willing to discuss a merger if the price were raised to a level
that reflects ``the substantial prospects of NCR's business plan,
the strategic importance of NCR to AT&amp;T's future and the value of
avoiding a disruptive takeover battle.''
   Allen said he believed the letter reflected the legal duty of
NCR's directors to consider such offers. He said he had no plans to
increase AT&amp;T's bid unless NCR provided documents that would
justify it.
   Allen said AT&amp;T decided to make its offer public Sunday after
NCR refused to negotiate over the weekend as a follow-up to Exley's
letter.
   But Exley said the company refused to provide confidential
information because AT&amp;T would not sign an agreement to postpone
further action on a takeover, as is typical in corporate mergers.

   When American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. was
granted the right to enter the computer business as part of the
1984 breakup of the Bell System, some predicted the phone giant
would become a computer colossus to rival IBM.
   It didn't happen.
   AT&amp;T has barely made a mark in the computer industry. Its
computer sales ranked about 17th in the world last year - far
behind No. 1 International Business Machines Corp., according to
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   AT&amp;T has lost an estimated $2 billion to $3 billion trying to
make a name for itself in the increasingly competitive computer
market. Analysts say that until recently, its strategy had been
muddled and its products mediocre.
   ``We were on the right track,'' AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen
said Monday. ``We were moving positively and having more successs.
But we were not going to achieve the critical mass of customers
alone.''
   Gregory Sawers, an industry analyst at the investment firm
Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., agreed.
   ``They've tried for six years now. It simply hasn't worked. They
don't have the critical mass. They don't have the product-line
breadth. They don't have the distribution facilities,'' he said.
   That realization prompted AT&amp;T's effort to buy NCR Corp., the
nation's fifth-largest computer maker, in a $6 billion offer
announced Sunday. NCR is resisting.
   Allen said NCR and AT&amp;T's Data Systems Group would make a good
match. Both are committed to ``open'' computing systems, machines
that follow industry standards and can easily work with computers
made by other companies.
   Both also use the popular Unix operating system, invented by
AT&amp;T. An operating system is the base layer of software that
controls a computer's internal functions.
   Rick Martin, a computer analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said NCR would make a good mate for AT&amp;T. ``These two
companies have virtually the same strategy and the same products,''
he said.
   Though AT&amp;T's computer business has not met expectations, it has
improved sales in recent years by focusing on selling
``networked,'' or connected, computer systems, and by striking
alliances with other computer makers.
   AT&amp;T owns almost 20 percent of Sun Microsystems Inc., the
top-selling maker of computer workstations. Last year, it bought
Istel Group Ltd., a British computer company, for $290 million.
   AT&amp;T earlier held a 22 percent stake in Olivetti, the Italian
computer and office-equipment maker, but traded it last year for a
stake in Olivetti's parent company. Olivetti made personal
computers for AT&amp;T, but AT&amp;T ended the deal after sales were
disapppointing.
   But the NCR bid would be AT&amp;T's biggest deal yet. Through it,
AT&amp;T would gain NCR's customer base as well as its highly regarded
line of computers.
   In September, NCR announced a bold strategy to replace its
entire computer line, from closet-size mainframes to desktop
machines, with industry-standard models built on the same Intel
Corp. computer chip.
   AT&amp;T said its expertise in communications would meld well with
NCR's computer sales in the retail and banking fields, which rely
on instantaneous transactions over phone lines and computer
networks.
   AT&amp;T had been believed to be looking for a major computer
acquistion for some time, with both Unisys Corp. and Digital
Equipment Corp. mentioned as contenders. But AT&amp;T may view the
smaller NCR as an easier target.
   The biggest-ever computer industry merger was Burroughs Corp.'s
$4.8 billion takeover of Sperry Corp. in 1986 that formed Unisys.
While the merger initially resulted in higher profits, Unisys has
run into trouble in recent years.

<HEAD>NCR: From Mechanical Cash Registers to Modern Computers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-AT&amp;T-NCR, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A proposed merger between AT&amp;T and NCR Corp.
comes at a time when NCR is at the zenith of its transformation
from a maker of low-tech cash registers to a leading producer of
innovative computer systems.
   NCR Chairman Charles E. Exley Jr. said Monday his company
opposes American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s offer to buy NCR for
$6 billion because it would distract NCR from its plans to market a
new line of computers in the 1990s.
   NCR was founded in 1884 when John Henry Patterson bought the
National Manufacturing Co. and renamed it National Cash Register.
The company nearly cornered the market in cash registers, creating
thousands of jobs for the Dayton-area economy.
   The company also developed a community-minded image. During a
major flood in 1913, NCR workers turned out boats made from
packing-crate lumber to rescue stranded citizens. And during the
Depression of the 1930s, NCR set up a relief kitchen for stricken
residents.
   ``If the independence of NCR is snuffed out, it will have some
impact on the community,'' Exley said.
   During World War II, NCR made motors for anti-aircraft rockets
and other defense contracts. With materials scarce for civilian
production, the company found a booming market in reconditioning
old cash registers.
   By 1960, the market for mechanical cash registers hit its peak,
and the Dayton NCR complex boasted 33 buildings on 55 acres. But
the company was hit with high costs and labor strife in the early
1970s, and the production of electro-mechanical cash registers
ended in Dayton, with the loss of 16,000 jobs.
   The company then stepped up production of electronic cash
registers and started to lean more heavily on its line of business
computers, which it began developing in the 1950s.
   Last September, NCR announced it would replace its entire
computer line with industry-standard machines that could
communicate easily with each other. The company said it would
produce the entire line - from tiny laptop models to powerful
mainframes - using the same Intel Corp. microprocessors.
   The move was the boldest yet by a traditional computer maker to
contend with the industry's move to ``open'' systems, or those that
follow industry standards so they easily can be connected.
   Analysts said the new line of machines could strengthen NCR's
position in the computer industry. The company is the nation's
fifth-largest computer maker.
   Exley said a merger with AT&amp;T doesn't make any business sense
for NCR.
   ``We think it would be a distraction from the great opportunity
that we have for the product programs that have been announced over
the last couple of months,'' he said.
   And Exley said NCR employees are concerned about the offer.
   ``It brings an entirely new element into the scene that our
people haven't confronted before,'' he said.
   NCR employs 56,000 workers at its 1,200 offices around the
world, including about 5,400 at its Dayton headquarters.

<HEAD>Fore! Hawaii Leaders Seek Huge Fees From Golf Course Developers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE DUNFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese demand for golf, Hawaii's sunny climate
and a limited supply of land for housing have political leaders
here asking for up to $100 million as par for the course.
   The idea to charge golf course developers ``community impact
fees'' to pay for rental housing has drawn support of Gov. John
Waihee and Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi.
   Supporters call it a way to force developers - who stand to make
huge profits exploiting Hawaii's limited land - to give something
back to the community. Critics say it's a tempting but legally
questionable scheme to tax developers under the guise of state and
county land-use regulations.
   With about 50 golf courses being proposed statewide by various
developers - many of them Japanese - proceeds to the local
government under the plan could climb well into the billions of
dollars. Some developers are ready to pay.
   Jurigi Co. of Japan agreed to pay Honolulu $111 million for a
just-completed $40 million municipal golf course near Pearl Harbor
and $200 million more in community impact fees for permission to
build two more courses on Oahu, where Honolulu is located.
   The City Council rejected the proposal, but its chairman, Arnold
Morgado, agrees with the concept.
   In September, Morgado, the governor and the mayor said golf
courses take up land that could be used for housing, and ``require
large tracts of undeveloped land at or near locations which have
scenic, recreational or cultural significance to the community.''
Fasi said the fees would be subject to negotiation.
   Hawaii's leaders are trying to cash in on high-priced
memberships in Hawaii golf courses being peddled in Japan.
   For instance, Shinwa Golf Corp., owner of the Wailea Resort on
the island of Maui, has offered Japanese citizens 1,000 memberships
at $115,000 each in a new Wailea golf course.
   University of Hawaii Professor David Callies, an expert on
land-use law, said impact fees have been found unconstitutional
when they exceed a development's actual effect on such things as
roads, sewers and the environment.
   ``Impact fees are not revenue-raising tools and golf courses are
appropriate open space uses in the right places,'' Callies said.
   ``It is difficult to see how a golf course generates $100
million in infrastructure costs, which is the sole legal basis for
charging such a fee,'' he said.
   Dan Davidson, executive director of the Land Use Research
Foundation, a research and trade organization for landowners and
developers, said impact fees are tempting from a fiscal standpoint.
   ``It is, however, a tax and the city has no authority to impose
this sort of tax in the guise of a land-use regulation,'' he said.
   Harold Masumoto, director of the state's planning office, said
Hawaii could avoid the potential problem of linking golf course
fees to actual impacts by entering into development agreements.
   That way it would not be an impact fee, but a mutual agreement
by the developer to make a contribution to a rental housing fund,
he said.
   In 1988, the state Land Use Commission decided that major
developers had to make 60 percent of their homes ``affordable'' for
low- and middle-income families.
   In August, the same group for the first time imposed the
governor's new policy of requiring hotel and resort developers to
create one non-tourism job for every hotel room they build, or pay
the state $25,000 per room.
   Wali Osman, director of research for the real estate firm Monroe
&amp; Friedlander Inc., said the trend is a result of the state's
frustration in handling housing problems and diversifying the
economy through traditional means. He said exactions from
developers won't solve the housing problems.
   The state is going ahead anyway.
   Last month, the Board of Land and Natural Resources proposed
that Minami Group USA pay $15 million in impact fees in exchange
for extending a permit to complete a $100 million golf course on
land zoned for conservation use. The extension was needed because
rain had delayed construction.
   An attorney for Minami told the board he doubted the legality of
the new proposed assessments, but said his client wanted to be ``a
responsible neighbor'' and was willing to work with the state and
local groups.

<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. said 600 workers
in its energy systems unit will lose their jobs in an effort to
make the company more competitive.
   The company on Monday said the reduction, which involves 300
layoffs and 300 voluntary retirements at the end of December, is
necessary to strengthen Westinghouse in the domestic and foreign
nuclear power markets.
   ``Like many other U.S. companies, we face intense competition in
our home market and internationally,'' said Nathaniel D. Woodson,
vice president of the unit. ``We intend to win, but to do so we
must reduce costs.''
   All of the employees affected by the move are in salaried
positions and all but 11 work in the Pittsburgh area, where
Westinghouse is headquartered. The company has 17,500 employees in
the Pittsburgh area and is the largest private employer in the
region.
   Westinghouse said it offered a ``voluntary separation program''
to employees aged 57 or older to lessen the impact of the
reduction. About 300 employees accepted the offer, which will
provide a year's pay to those who agree to quit before the end of
the year.

<HEAD>Lockheed Board Rejects Latest Simmons Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp.'s board rejected a $1.6
billion takeover offer from Texas investor Harold Simmons, saying
the buyout proposal would burden the company with too much debt.
   Lockheed Chairman Dan Tellep informed Simmons of the board's
decision in a letter Monday in which he called the proposal
``highly risky.''
   Simmons, Lockheed's single largest shareholder with 19.8 percent
of the stock, had proposed turning Lockheed into a private company.
   He lost a battle to take control of Lockheed's board last March,
but won concessions from the aerospace company.
   Among them was a promise from Tellep to appoint up to three new
directors to the board. Lockheed announced four appointments Monday
- all approved by big shareholders other than Simmons, Tellep said.
The appointments increased the size of the board to 18.
   ``I think we have more than fulfilled the commitment we made at
last year's annual meeting,'' Tellep said Monday in a telephone
interview.
   Simmons' chief strategist, J. Landis Martin, criticized the
company for not conferring with Simmons on the new board members.
   ``How about the 20 percent shareholder?'' Martin said in a
telephone interview. ``He didn't come to the 20 percent shareholder
on any of these people.''
   Through his NL Industries, Simmons had offered $40 a share for
the Lockheed stock he doesn't already own. He said he would put up
$400 million in cash and $400 million in his own assets, but wanted
t use $800 million of Lockheed's assets to finance the rest.
   Aerospace analyst Lawrence Harris with Bateman Eichler, Hill
Richards Inc. in Los Angeles, values Lockheed at $55 per share. He
said the proposal appeared to be merely preparation for a second
proxy war for control of Lockheed.
   ``The next annual meeting is not that far off, so this is one
way NL can be on record as saying, `We attempted to get $40 for the
shareholders,''' Harris said.
   Asked if another fight for the board was likely, Martin said:
``We're going to consider our options, which would include that.''
   Lockheed's $1.3 billion in debt would have to be refinanced if
the board went along with Simmons' plan. That, plus the new $800
million in debt, would have to be borrowed at a time when loans
from any source are hard to come by.
   Simmons maintains the additional debt could be taken on because
Lockheed could stop paying an estimated $113 million in annual
dividends. After accounting for taxes, that would yield the
equivalent of $165 million per year, Martin said.
   Tellep said that was not enough to justify loading Lockheed with
$2.1 billion in debt.
   The new directors are: Robert G. Kirby, 65, board chairman of
Capital Guardian Trust in Los Angeles; Frank Savage, 52, senior
vice president of the Equitable Life Assurance Socety of the United
States; retired Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, 60, former chief of naval
operations; and Douglas C. Yearley, 54, chairman and chief
executive of Phelps Dodge Corp. in Phoenix.

<HEAD>Closing Arguments Begin in Soybean Trader Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors scoffed at the claims of soybean
traders on trial for fraud that they violated Chicago Board of
Trade rules to benefit their customers.
   Closing arguments began Monday in the trial of 10 traders
fingered in a federal probe of corruption at the BOT and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In all, 48 people were indicted after
FBI agents posed as traders and secretly tape-recorded
conversations.
   Defense attorneys presented testimony and evidence during the
three-month trial intended to show that unauthorized trading
outside the pit was common and necessary to satisfy customers and
large brokerage houses.
   The prosecution's closing arguments were scheduled to conclude
today. The defense will then begin its summary, which is expected
to continue through Thursday.
   Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Rotert urged the jury to
disregard testimony from traders claiming that the exchange's rules
were outdated.
   ``That's a defense?'' Rotert asked. ``Well, I don't think it
is.''
   The Board of Trade allows grain producers and handlers to lock
in prices and pass the risk on to speculators, who accept that risk
and try to make money from it, Rotert said.
   ``They took that premise and perverted it,'' Rotert said.
``Their risk was passed back. The risk was passed on to the next
customer.''
   Rotert said soybean traders should have the same responsibility
to treat clients fairly and honestly as lawyers and doctors have.
   ``The customer has every legitimate right to believe and trust
that the rules of the Chicago Board of Trade are being followed,''
he said.
   ``Lawyers are appropriately governed by rules,'' he said.
``Doctors hold people's lives in their hands and they are governed
by rules. Commodities traders hold people's money in their hands
and they also should be governed by rules.''
   U.S. District Judge George Marovich presided over the jury trial
of the traders, charged with conspiring to defraud customers
through illegal trading practices.
   On trial are: Martin J. Dempsey, Charles W. Bergstrom, Bradley
Ashman, William A. Barcal III, Edward A. Cox, Thomas P. Kenney,
John Ryan, Joel J. Fetchenhier, Sheldon Schneider and John A.
Vercillo.
   They face scores of charges including racketeering, mail fraud
and wire fraud.
   Rotert said the traders deliberately violated the Board of
Trade's rules prohibiting trading outside the open-outcry system
and the board's operating hours.
   In the open outcry system, traders crowd into designated trading
pits where they buy and sell contracts for future deliveries of
commodities through a combination of hand signals and shouted buy-
and sell-orders.
   The defendants are accused of conducting trades outside of the
open-outcry system of the Board of Trade. Profits from those trades
were used to make up any money traders cost customers while making
a mistake, the prosecution said. The exchange's rules state the
trader must personally make up the difference in the event of a
mistake.
   ``These men intended to get money from customers under false
pretenses,'' Rotert said. ``They think things like ethics, fairness
and the law are a matter of context.''

<HEAD>Consultant Sentenced to Probation in Iranian Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A businessman with ties to the Iran-Contra
affair has been sentenced to two years probation for his role in a
conspiracy to sell confidential Ashland Oil Inc. documents to Iran.
   U.S. District Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum on Monday also ordered
Roy M. Furmark, a private consultant in the oil industry, to pay
Ashland $15,000 in restitution.
   Furmark pleaded guilty in March to one count of conspiracy to
commit wire fraud.
   Furmark, of Brooklyn, testified to Congress in 1987 that he was
involved in the sale of American arms to Iran.
   In the Ashland case, Furmark cooperated with prosecutors for
more than a year before his plea and helped implicate former
Ashland chairman Orin E. Atkins in the conspiracy.
   On Friday, Atkins, who also pleaded guilty to conspiracy, was
sentenced to two years probation and 600 hours of community service
for his role in the scheme.
   Furmark admitted that he agreed to help Atkins arrange meetings
with representatives of the Iranian National Oil Co., which was
contemplating a lawsuit against Ashland for the company's decision
not to pay $283 million for crude oil purchased in 1979.
   Atkins has said he wanted to sell to the Iranians confidential
documents involving the disputed oil deal that he obtained after he
was forced to resign as chairman in 1981 but remained as a paid
Ashland consultant.
   While the Iranians never bought the documents, they later sued
Ashland and last year obtained a $325 million settlement, which
with interest was worth more than $500 million.
   ``This episode in my life has been totally uncharacteristic to
my life and what I stand for,'' Furmark told Cedarbaum. ``I am
deeply sorry.''
   Cedarbaum said she considered Furmark's cooperation in deciding
his sentence. Furmark set up a meeting with Atkins in 1988 where
they discussed renewed efforts to sell the documents Iran. A
videotape of that meeting made by investigators led to charges
against Atkins.

<HEAD>Growth Slows in Third Quarter Compared with Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's economy grew 1.0 percent in the third
quarter from the previous quarter, reflecting falling corporate
investment and personal consumption, the Economic Planning Agency
reported Tuesday.
   The nation's gross national product grew at an annualized rate
of 4.1 percent in the July-September period.
   In the second quarter, the Japanese GNP was up 1.4 percent from
the firt quarter, and was growing at an annualized rate of 5.5
percent.
   Agency officials said high interest rates are limiting growth by
cutting into capital investment, which has been the largest force
driving the economy.
   But they said the latest figures indicate the fall in corporate
spending is gradual and won't lead to a sudden drop in expansion.

<HEAD>Saturn Production Startup Slow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saturn Corp. has produced lerss than 2,200 Saturn
cars at its Tennessee plant since retail production began this
summer, and dealers are feeling the pinch.
   Some dealers say they have only one or two cars to show off to
prospective customers.
   Saturn officials had said they expected to build about 17,000
cars by the end of the year, but now say they won't meet the
target.
   Spokeswoman Jennifer Schettler said Monday that just 2,162
Saturn cars have been built at the company's Spring Hill, Tenn.,
plant since retail production began in the summer.
   She and other Saturn officials said the company has a rigid
quality control system at the plant which has resulted in
lower-than-expected shipments to dealers.
   The company is a $3 billion project set up as a subsidiary of
General Motors Corp.
   There are 52 Saturn dealers open in the United States, up from
29 when the line of small cars went on sale Oct. 25.
   ``We opened our doors Thursday evening, but aside from a display
model on loan from Saturn, I don't have any cars,'' said Karen
Tibus, president of Saturn of Plymouth, about 15 miles west of
Detroit. ``I can tough it out for a while, but it gets expensive
when you have a payroll to meet and the utility meters are
running.''
   She said she wanted to open with an 18-person staff, but that
was cut to nine.
   Jeremy Anwyl, an automotive marketing consultant in Irvine,
Calif., said the situation would be worse if Saturn had released to
dealers cars with quality problems.
   ``You're better off being uncomfortable for two or three months
than ending up with a $3 billion turkey that you eventually have to
kill,'' he said.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Egyptian oil official Tuesday ruled
out the possibility that Iraq might be expelled from an Arab
petroleum organization as punishment for invading Kuwait.
   Mohammed Shawkat, adviser to Oil Minister Abdel-Hady Kandil,
said there is no plan for oil ministers of the Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries even to discuss the idea at their
meeting Saturday in Cairo.
   ``To begin with, this is not on the agenda,'' said Shawkat, who
will be the conference spokesan.
   ``Moreover, it's a political issue, and OAPEC's charter excludes
politics. The organization has economic objectives involving
cooperation and policy coordination among its members.''
   Shawkat was commenting on speculation that Kuwait or other
members of the 10-country group would suggest to the ministers that
Iraq be expelled. There also have been reports that the ministers
would consider moving the organization's headquarters from Kuwait,
which Iraq annexed on Aug. 8, six days after the invasion.
   Such a suggestion might come before the ministers, Shawkat said.
Iraq might want it moved to Baghdad to dramatize its assertion of
sovereignty over Kuwait, or another member may propose temporarily
relocating OAPEC's headquarters because of its inability to
function under Iraqi occupation.
   ``Again, this is not on the agenda, but someone may suggest it
under the customary agenda item of other business,'' he said in an
interview.
   But he indicated that Egypt, the meeting's chairman, would
contest it as a double violation of the charter: the suggestion, at
least if proposed by Iraq, would be political, and the charter
specifies Kuwait as the organization's home.
   Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Libya founded OAPEC in 1968 partly to
stimulate investment by member countries in each other's oil
industries. In addition to the founders, it now includes Egypt,
Iraq, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Syria and Algeria.
   Shawkat said the agenda of the Cairo meeting includes a joint
project for building a drydock in Algeria, a plan to develop an
OAPEC training institute in Baghdad and the group's 1991 budget. He
refused to disclose the proposed budget estimates.
   Iraq has not notified Egypt as the organizer whether its oil
minister will participate, Shawkat said. If he does not come, Iraq
will be represented by its Cairo ambassador, Nabil Najm.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last month named his son-in-law
Hussein Kamel Hassan acting oil minister after firing Issam
al-Chalabi from the oil portfolio.

<HEAD>Inland Steel Says Indiana Harbor Works to Close</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inland Steel Co. has announced plans to close the
74-year-old structural mill at its Indiana Harbor Works unit on
March 3 if business conditions don't improve, officials said.
   The move would affect about 300 hourly and 25 salaried workers
in East Chicago, Ind. Officials at the Chicago-based Inland
informed the United Steelworkers Union of the plans Monday.
   ``It's not a shock,'' said Mike Mezo, president of United
Steelworkers Local 1010. ``We knew it was coming for years.''
   Mezo said he expects most of the workers eventually will find
positions in other parts of the Harbor Works, which will remain
open. Company officials said a substantial number of workers at the
northwestern Indiana plant also are expected to take early
retirement.
   The closure comes because competition is hurting Inland, said
Delmar Rediger, president of Inland Steel Bar and Structural Steel
Co., a division of Inland Steel.
   The structural mill has been producing about 275,000 tons a
year, mostly for use in the construction industry. Officials said
the mill has produced a ``modest cash flow''' in recent years. But
they expected the structural unit would lose money in 1991 because
of difficult market conditions.

   Gordon Becker never stops thinking about
Christmas.
   As president and founder of Becker Group - the nation's largest
retail decorator - visions of sugar plums dance 'round his head all
year as he concocts ways to turn ubiquitous shopping centers and
malls into customer-luring winter wonderlands.
   The company's creations go beyond strings of lights and plywood
reindeer. There are castles and Christmas trees as tall as office
buildings. There are scenes of Disney characters, Sesame Street
creatures, Peanuts, Rudolph the Red-Nose Reindeer and Garfield the
Cat.
   Becker Group installed new displays in 145 shopping centers and
malls this year at an average cost of $100,000 apiece. The
company's clientele, though, totals 350 malls and centers
nationwide.
   Becker said revenue for the privatly owned company is expected
to exceed $13 million in 1990, with the Christmas decorations
accounting for nearly 95 percent of business.
   ``It's a fun business, but there are nerve-wracking moments,''
said the slightly rotund 57-year-old Becker, a former store Santa.
   Becker's busiest time is the two months before Christmas, when
the company ships and assembles its Christmas creations. Throughout
the year he's taking orders, making plans and surveying malls and
stores.
   Business wasn't always so brisk, however.
   Becker said he was forced to file for bankruptcy protection
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in 1976. Although
he managed to stay in business, he struggled until 1983, when
things finally started to take off.
   It was that year when Becker began targeting developers who own
groups of malls. Those contracts now comprise 60 percent of his
business.
   ``I was meeting with a developer in Dallas in 1983 and he told
me I might have a good year. He had 12 malls and he was thinking
about giving me five or six,'' Becker said. ``I said why not all
12? I came back with almost a million dollar order.''
   Revenue immediately jumped from $3 million, where it had been
mired for several years, to $4.7 million.
   Today, Becker's company decorates malls for 13 developers,
including Taubman Co., which owns 22 shopping centers, and the
Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., which owns 17 shopping centers, the San
Francisco 49ers and the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team.
   Among his clients, the Northwest Plaza in St. Louis, Mo.,
recently paid Becker $400,000 for a giant Santa Castle complete
with 50-foot banners strung through 10-foot high wreaths. The owner
of the mall is the New York-based development company Paramount
Group Inc., which owns three other malls in the United States. All
are clients of Becker.
   ``We probably do the largest Santa photo concession. Because its
so breath-taking, people will drive from miles around to get their
picture taken in our Santa castle rather than somewhere else,''
said Christi Parks, marketing director for Northwest Plaza.
   ``There's absolutely no doubt its worth the money we spent on
it,'' she said. ``Our mall has always had a reputation for having
special Christmas decorations. For us to do something every few
feet was not acceptable. We literally need to fill the mall with
Christmas.''
   Fair Lane and Twelve Oaks shopping centers in Detroit spent more
than $350,000 each on Becker holiday decorations. At Cherry Creek
Mall in Denver, Becker provided a 52-foot high Christmas tree that
measures 28 feet in diameter.
   The Cranberry Mall in Westminster, Md., paid $50,000 for its
``Help Garfield Find Pooky'' display. Several Garfield figures
powered by compressed air pop up in a house as the fat orange
cartoon cat searches for his favorite stuffed animal.
   Most of Becker Group's decorations fall in the traditional line
and the more elaborate Fifth Avenue line, Becker said.
   Displays last about three years, meaning one third of the
company's customers purchase new decorations every year.
   Becker's passion for Christmas began in high school, when he
worked as a store Santa for some pocket money for the holidays.
After he graduated from the University of Maryland, he started a
Santa school and rental business.
   The school was abandoned in the early 1960s as he became more
involved in the decorating business.
   ``When it started 35 years ago, my office was my bedroom in my
mother's house and the garage was a warehouse,'' said Becker, who
operates today out of a 19th century townhouse in a fashionable
neighborhood in Baltimore. The firm employs more thn 100 people.
   ``In the 1950s, you have to remember, shopping centers were new.
There were no companies that existed. You had to really jury-rig
everything,'' recalled Becker.
   In the beginning, he said, he would do anything for a client and
became known for setting up spotlights in front of stores.
   Becker said a background in show business helped - his father,
Lou Becker, was a bandleader who worked with Tommy and Jimmy
Dorsey.
   ``It's theater in its purest form,'' he said. ``The way we deal
with people, there are the same technical problems as in mounting a
show.
   ``It has to look like the Empire State building, but when its
over, two guys have to be able to pack it up and put it away.''

   The stock market weakened early today, stalling
after a two-day runup.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which gained 5.94 points
Monday after adding 40.84 points on Friday, fell 9.15 to 2,556.44
by 10 a.m. EST.
   Among broader market barometers, the New York Stock Exchange
index of all listed stocks fell 0.55 to 176.52. On the American
Stock Exchange, the market-value index fell 0.65 to 301.95.
   Declining issues outnumbered gains by about 2-1 on the NYSE,
with 647 up, 344 down and 465 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board
totaled 21.9 million shares after a half hour of trading.
   Stock strategists said the market's behavior partly reflected a
decline in prices overseas. Stocks on the London and Tokyo markets
weakened overnight.
   They also attributed the decline in U.S. stock prices to an
underlying anxiety about the domestic economy, which by many
assessments has fallen into recession. The gnawing uncertainty
about the outcome of planned U.S.-Iraqi talks to resolve the
Persian Gulf crisis also weighed on stock prices.
   Citicorp and Chase Manhattan, the nation's largest banks, led
the list of actively traded NYSE stocks early in the session, both
rising on word that Federal Reserve was loosening reserve
requirements to stimulate lending and ease a credit crunch. The
move was expected to help boost the profit of banks.

<HEAD>British Airways Seeking to Create Berlin-based Airline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways said Tuesday it is seeking to
create a new Berlin-based airline which would compete with the
German carrier Lufthansa.
   Such an airline, which aims to turn Berlin into a hub, could
expand greatly in coming years by providing East-West European air
services and feeding into long-haul transcontinental flights.
   British Airways would hold a 49 percent stake in the new
carrier, and unspecified German investors would own the rest, said
a British Airways spokeswoman, who wasn't identified in accordance
with airline practice.
   ``We are still talking to a number of German interests. It's not
going to be an immediate announcement. It's very much at the
planning stages,'' she said.
   The new airline, as yet unnamed, isn't expected to begin
operating until 1993.
   British Airways is advertising in the trade press for pilots in
preparation for the airline's creation, the spokeswoman said.
   The carrier has been spurred to seek such a deal by German
unification, which effectively forces foreign carriers out of
Germany by 1993.
   British Airways currently operates a Berlin-based fleet of nine
airplanes providing 86 daily flights to nine German cities.
   ``We're keen to continue to operate in Berlin. We've been in
there for 44 years. We want to continue, and expand it,'' the
spokeswoman said.
   British Airways has served Berlin since World War II when it
flew in supplies as part of the airlifts through which the Allied
forces replenished the blockaded city.
   After the Berlin Wall came down, Pan American World Airways, the
primary provider of Berlin air services, sold its operations to
Lufthansa, which had been prohibited from operating out of Berlin's
Tegl airport since the war.
   British Airways, which has transformed itself from a poor
airline into a world class carrier since its 1987 privatization,
has been expanding its European operations.
   It recently announced plans to create a new Moscow-based airline
called Air Russia, which the British airline wants to operate
jointly with the state-owned Soviet carrier Aeroflot.
   It also is seeking to turn the government-owned Belgian airline
Sabena into a carrier jointly owned by British Airways, KLM Royal
Dutch Airways and Sabena. That deal, which aims to make Brussels
another hub, awaits regulatory approval from the European
Commission.

<HEAD>FTC Ends Delay of Chevron Stock Purchase By Pennzoil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission has cleared
Pennzoil Co. to proceed with previously announced plans to boost
its 8.8 percent stake in Chevron Corp., Pennzoil disclosed today.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Pennzoil said the FTC had lifted a delay imposed in August on the
Houston-based oil giant's plans to buy an additional 3.9 million
shares of Chevron stock from time to time.
   The FTC said it wanted more information after Pennzoil, which
already held 32 million shares of San Francisco-based Chevron's
stock, said in July that it intended to spend about $291 million to
acquire some 3.9 million more shares.
   That would boost Pennzoil's stake to just under the 10 percent
level that would a trigger a Chevron shareholders' rights plan,
also known as a ``poison pill'' anti-takeover defense, according to
Pennzoil.
   Pennzoil said the stock purchase was only for longterm
investment.
   The company said it already had spent more than $2 billion to
obtain the 32 million Chevron shares it now holds.
   Under federal antitrust laws, companies seeking to take over a
publicly-traded company worth $100 million or more, or trying to
acquire stock worth more than $15 million, must obtain anti-trust
clearance from the FTC.

   Grain and soybean futures were mixed in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The market received a boost from reports the Soviet Union will
be making large purchases on the world's grain markets next year,
said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
in Chicago.
   The reports indicated the Soviet Union may be importing about 10
million metric tons of grain from foreign producers in the first
quarter.
   A sharp drop in soybean and soymeal prices on the Rotterdam
market is putting pressure on soybean futures.
   Corn prices were higher on speculative buying. Wheat futures
were steady to slightly lower due to commission house selling.
   In early trading, wheat was a { cent to 1 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.46} a bushel; corn was
unchanged to } cent higher with December at $2.30\ a bushel; oats
were a { cent lower to a { cent higher with December at $1.13\ a
bushel; and soybeans were 2{ cents lower to } cent higher with
January at $6 a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mixed and pork futures sharply lower in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures were boosted by their steep discount to cash
prices, with feeder cattle futures pressured by lower cash prices
paid at auction.
   Pork futures were pushed lower by an expected increase in
movement of hogs to market. Lower cash prices also weighed on the
market.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .05 cent higher with December
at 78.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .28 cent lower to .10

<TEXT>
   Talks to revamp the world free trading
system are very close to collapse, a U.S. trade official said
today.
   Ambassador Rufus Yerxa, a deputy U.S. trade representative, told
a news conference the European Community had not responded to
demands from most other countries for greater liberalization on
farm trade.
   ``It's quite clear the ball is now in the community's court,''
he said.
   Yerxa, asked about Australian Trade Minister Neal Blewett's
statement that something had to give by the day's end, replied:
   ``It is safe to say we share the concern of Minister Blewett of
Australia that these negotiations are very close to collapse.''
   President Bush, in Uruguay, the birthplace of the so-called
Uruguay Round talks, expressed hope that the negotiations might yet
succeed.
   ``We must use this meeting to find the political will to limit
or reduce distortions in trade,'' Bush said.
   Yerxa said it was ``highly unlikely'' there would be further
negotiations unless the EC changed its position. No talks on the
key farm trade question were scheduled.
   As he spoke, EC trade ministers were gathering to discuss their
position in talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
a treaty pledging its members to free trade.
   Despite pressure from many sides on the Europeans for deep cuts
in the EC's costly farm support programs, community officials
showed no willingness to make new reductions in their agriculture
offer at the 107-nation Uruguay Round, the most ambitious trade
talks ever.
   ``There is absolutely no hope of having an agreement this
afternoon or even tomorrow afternoon - but possibly by Friday,''
said Ray MacSharry, the farm chief of the 12-nation trading bloc.
   Officials are locked in a make-or-break effort to overhaul the
global trading system by week's end.
   The comprehensive agreement they are seeking would lower trade
barriers and write new rules covering trade in 15 areas, including
agriculture, manufactured goods, textiles, trademarks and patents
and services, such as banking and telecommunications.
   The Uruguay Round bargaining, which opened in 1986 in the
Uruguayan resort of Punta del Este, has broken down in recent
months because of a stubborn fight between the European Community
and its major trading partners over government payments to farmers.
   The United States, backed by Argentina, Australia and other
nations, has demanded - so far without results - that the European
Community peel away much of the support program for its 10 million
farmers.
   There appeared to be growing anger over the community's refusal
to budge on agriculture, which a number of nations, including the
United States, Australia and Argentina, have said is key to an
overall deal.
   The EC has offered to trim only 30 percent in subsidies for
major crops over a 10-year period, counting from 1986. The United
States is urging it to slash subsidies by 75 percent to 90 percent
over the next decade.
   Canadian State Minister Charles Mayer dismissed the community's
offer as ``mumbo jumbo'' and said: ``In our country, someone who
comes around selling snake oil, we call him a quack.''
   Many European farmers view the subsidy cuts as threatening their
livelihood. Police fired tear gas and water cannons Monday to
disperse 30,000 farmers outside the European Parliament building in
the Belgian capital.
   The United States believes that without a commitment to reduce
farm subsidies, Third World countries will walk away from the
negotiations, dooming any chances to get new trade rules to cover
service industries and copyright theft.
   Third World leaders say the subsidies steal potential markets
from their farmers, ruining agriculture in their countries.

<HEAD>Portman Announces Lenders Have Approved Pool Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlanta architect John C. Portman Jr. said he has
won preliminary approval from lenders of his debt restructuring
plan and completed a separate agreement refinancing the Peachtree
Center office complex.
   Portman has been meeting with about 20 lenders since August in
an attempt to refinance a debt that reportedly tops $1.6 billion.
Lenders participating in the restructuring had been asked to
approve the terms by Saturday.
   Portman on Monday called the plan ``the best way to protect the
long-term interests of our company, our creditors and our
tenants.''
   Dennis Glass, executive vice president and chief financial
officer for The Portman Companies, said the loan agreements and
other documents on the restructuring should be finalized in late
January.
   ``We have received overwhelming support for the collateral pool
agreement from our lenders,'' Glass said.
   The group has been using that term collateral pool to describe
the process of converting unsecured loans into loans backed by
collateral. Terms have not been disclosed.
   Portman also announced Monday completion of a separate agreement
to refinance Peachtree Center by increasing the equity position of
the holder of a $332.6 million mortgage on the property, Equitable
Real Estate Investment Management Inc.
   The agreement with Equitable had been announced in early
November, when Portman and the mortgage company agreed to terms
designed to stop foreclosure proceedings initiated by Equitable.
Limited partners in the property, mainly Portman relatives and
employees, had to approve the deal before it could be finalized.
   Under the agreement, Equitable increased its ownership of the
complex and agreed to make significant property improvements,
including completing a current mall expansion.
   The Peachtree Center complex in downtown Atlanta includes six
office towers, a retail shopping mall, two parking decks and an
athletic center.
   Portman also has under construction a 60-story addition to the
complex called One Peachtree Center and another building nearby
called the Atlanta Gift Mart. He just opened an apparel mart in San
Francisco and a massive office-hotel-retail complex in Shanghai,
China.

   Stock prices turned mixed in slow trading early
today, stalling after a two-day runup.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which gained 5.94 points
Monday after adding 40.84 points on Friday, was up 1.74 to 2,567.33
by noon EST.
   Among broader market barometers, the New York Stock Exchange
index of all listed stocks rose 0.12 to 177.19. On the American
Stock Exchange, the market-value index fell 0.23 to 302.37.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered gains by about a 7-to-6
margin on the NYSE, with 694 down, 617 up and 547 unchanged. Volume
on the Big Board totaled 81.38 million shares in the morning, vs.
83.24 million Monday morning.
   Stock strategists said the market's behavior partly reflected a
decline on key markets overseas. Stocks in Tokyo fell sharply
overnight and were lower in London as well.
   They also attributed the decline in U.S. stock prices to an
underlying anxiety about the domestic economy, which by many
assessments has fallen into recession and dimmed the outlook for
corporate profits early next year.
   Gnawing uncertainties also persisted over the questionable
outcome of world trade talks in Europe and the consequences of
planned U.S.-Iraqi negotiations to avert war in the Persian Gulf.
   Bank stocks showed prominent advances among the most actively
traded issues, rising on word that the Federal Reserve was easing
reserve requirements to stimulate lending and ease a credit crunch
hurting the economy.
   Citicorp rose 1\ to 14&lsqb;, Chase Manhattan rose { to 11{, and
BankAmerica rose 1\ to 24\.
   NCR, target of a takeover bid by AT&amp;T, rose 1| to 83&lsqb;. AT&amp;T rose
&lsqb; to 30\.
   Continental Airlines led the Amex's most-active list, dropping \
to 1}. The highly indebted company filed for bankruptcy court
protection from creditors on Monday.
   In the over-the-counter market the leading issue was MCI, down &lsqb;
to 19&lsqb; with more than 1.5 million shares traded. Investors
evidently have been trimming their holdings of the
telecommunications concern recently on reports that AT&amp;T's
aggressive business strategies have stalled MCI's growth.

<HEAD>Deere Earnings Down for Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOLINE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm manufacturing giant Deere &amp; Co. on
Tuesday reported its fourth-quarter earnings fell 27 percent from a
year ago, due mainly to lower production of lawn-care and
industrial products.
   Deere reported net income of $74.5 million, or 98 cents a share,
in the quarter ended Oct. 31, down from $103.2 million, or $1.37
per share, in the same period of 1989.
   Revenue totaled $2.06 billion, up 3 percent from the $2 billion
earned in the same three months last year.
   Deere attributed the earnings decline to lower production of its
lawn and grounds-care products and industrial equipment. It also
cited higher sales incentive costs in an extremely competitive
market, as well as a four-week strike at the company's lawn and
grounds-care equipment factory in Wisconsin.
   The company has put about 500 factory workers on indefinite
layoff in the past two months in response to slumping sales. In
addition, plant shutdowns will idle 4,500 workers in Iowa and
Illinois in the next couple of weeks as the company tries to slow
down production to match demand.
   Company spokesman Robert J. Combs said uncertainty over the
economy and the Persian Gulf standoff were combining to depress
sales of farm equipment and other products.
   ``There's an atmosphere of uncertainty we've been seeing since
August,'' Combs said. ``As a result, we expect North American farm
equipment sales to be somewhat lower.Our response has been to
reduce production levels for 1991 by 12 percent.''
   Deere's financial subsidiaries also reported an earnings
decline. The farm credit, insurance and health care operations
earned $33.7 million in the quarter, down from $36.5 million last
year.
   For the year, the farm equipment manufacturer said it earned a
record $411.1 million, or $5.42 a share, marking the third
consecutive record-setting year for the 153-year-old company. The
company made $380.2 million, or $5.06 a share, in fiscal 1989.
   Yearly revenue came to a record $7.8 billion, up from $7.2
billion in 1989.

<HEAD>American General Says It Reviews Two Bids on Subsidiaries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurance giant American General Corp. said
Tuesday it is reviewing two bids for its Home Service insurance
subsidiaries, but received no bids for the company as a whole.
   The company put itself up for sale in May amid speculation it
could be the target of a hostile takeover. But a dearth of buyers
led American General to set a Monday deadline for bidding and to
offer to sell parts of the company.
   Senior Vice President James S. D'Agostino declined comment on
who submitted bids for the four subsidiaries, based in Nashville,
Tenn., and Jacksonville, Fla., or how much they offered.
   He said American General's board of directors was due to meet
Thursday and a more detailed announcement would be made then.
   Torchmark Corp., an insurance firm based in Birmingham, Ala.,
has been frequently mentioned as a potential bidder.
   Torchmark has been trying to acquire all or a part of American
General since March, when it informally proposed buying the company
for $50 a share, representing a total offer of more than $6
billion. The offer was turned down by American General officials,
who said the company was worth more.
   In midday trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange,
American General was up 25 cents a share at $29.25.

   Competition has revolutionalized relations
between management and labor, who have found in many industries
that they have to become partners to survive. In the second of a
three-part series, ``The New Workplace,'' Midwest Regional Reporter
Sharon Cohen explores the changes that have led to no more Us vs.

<TEXT>
   Each Monday, two guys named Mike get
together to talk about their future. Their jobs seemingly make them
rivals, but, in fact, they share a goal: survival.
   Mike O'Brien is a union leader. Mike Spitzley is a company man.
But in their meetings here at the General Motors plant, the two
talk costs, labor, quality - topics workers wouldn't have been
privy to years ago.
   ``Most of the things we talk about, it's `we.' It's not us vs.
them. We've pretty much recognized our goals are the same,'' said
Spitzley, manager of GM's 5,300-worker car-truck plant. ``We make
decisions together. ... I don't think there's anything I know I
wouldn't tell them if they asked me.''
   ``There's something different going on,'' said O'Brien,
president of UAW Local 95. ``Years ago, it wasn't any of our
business what went on in the business.''
   Like two boxers bloodied and bruised, union and management in a
small number of industries - mostly auto and steel - have stopped
fighting. Instead, they're joining forces, sharing ideas and
working together in ways they never would have before.
   Nowadays, blue and white collar, company and union, travel,
lobby and meet customers together. In perhaps the most
revolutionary example, Saturn Corp., both parties share all big
decisions, from choosing suppliers to the advertising agency for
the new auto company.
   ``An adversarial relationship cannot be compatible with today's
market. We're part of a world trade. We're no longer king this and
king that,'' said John Smith, administrative assistant to the
president of the United Steelworkers of America.
   ``Survival is probably not too strong a word for what drives the
two parties together,'' said Steelworkers' president Lynn Williams.
   Though there's a growing alliance, conflict remains, as
evidenced by bitter strikes against the New York Daily News,
Eastern Airlines and Pittston Co.
   Some labor officials also contend unions' acceptance of
concessions in the '80s didn't ensure job security. And
cooperation, they say, really is co-opting.
   ``The largest loss is the union's autonomy. We become one with
the corporate agenda. It's an unnatural place for the union to
be,'' said Jerry Tucker of the New Directions Movement, a dissident
autoworkers group.
   Even so, a survey released this year found at least half of 350
unionized manufacturers had some formal joint activities, most
begun in the 1980s.
   ``We've never seen anything as widespread in our own history,''
said William Cooke, a professor and associate dean at Wayne State
University, who conducted the survey and wrote a book on the topic.
``In every case, it's come out of the same, `If we don't change,
we're out of the market. The old way doesn't work well.' ''
   The biggest test of cooperation may be the layoffs and idling of
plants in the current economic downturn. Hard times, Cooke said,
could have a demoralizing effect and, perhaps, even crush the more
fragile partnerships.
   ``If (workers) perceive management as doing this without due
consideration for the welfare of employees ... it will have the
potential of destroying the efforts altogether,'' Cooke said. ``If
employees have information shared with them about the market ...
then employees, generally speaking, are able to accept management
decision-making.''
   Cooke's survey found partnerships in almost all industries -
including trucking, mining and public utilities - but they tend to
be most common in autos and steel, both battered by foreign
competition, plant closings and job losses.
   In the steel industry, the workforce shrank from 453,200 in 1979
to 168,900 in 1989, the American Iron and Steel Institute said. The
average annual employment in the auto industry dropped from 990,000
to 857,000 in the same period, the government said.
   Union ranks have shrunk, too. Nationwide, 17 percent of workers
were represented by a union in 1989, compared with 20 percent six
years earlier.
   For partnerships to make their businesses more competitive,
experts say, both sides must adapt: Managers must relinquish some
authority and give workers more responsibility, while unions must
become more flexible to increase competitiveness.
   The auto industry has been in the vanguard of this movement,
with joint training, health and safety, education and quality
programs, some since the 1970s.
   Labor-management partnerships vary in scope. For example:
   - AT&amp;T and the Communications Workers of America and
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers formed a joint
non-profit corporation in 1986 that provides training and job
placement and finances employee education. About 66,200 AT&amp;T
workers have participated in the programs.
   The CCWA, however, adopted a measure this summer expressing
anger over layoffs, consolidations and forced transfers and
questioning cooperation with the company.
   - Northwest Aluminum Co. in The Dalles, Ore., reopened in 1986
under new ownership with a team concept and a new philosophy. Labor
and management participate in interviewing prospective employees.
Union meetings are held on company property; management attends at
the beginning to answer questions. There no longer are separate
worker-manager showers or Christmas parties.
   ``Those little things when you stack them up, put them in a
bucket, made a big difference,'' said personnel manager Dick Schon.
``We argue like hell. It's not a love-in. The difference is
basically I think we are a team.''
   - The New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., a Toyota-GM venture
in Fremont, Calif., holds quarterly union-management meetings, and
representatives from both parties share an office in the labor
relations department.
   ``They're treating (workers) as if people had brains. Before you
had to check your brain outside when you came in the door in the
morning,'' said George Nano, bargaining committee chairman for UAW
Local 2244.
   The plant has a rancorous labor-management record when operated
by GM alone. ``It was like a war here,'' Nano said, adding that now
``it's not peaches and cream. (But) it's a hell of a lot better.''
   There's probably no more innovative partnership than at Saturn,
the GM subsidiary in Spring Hill, Tenn.
   The union has a seat on the plant's governing body. Saturn's
president and UAW coordinator have offices in the same suite and do
business together. All major decisions - including product design,
suppliers, dealers, equipment, machinery, investments - are made by
consensus.
   In one ad, one Saturn autoworker explains: ``We've had our share
of knockdown-dragouts over the years. ... It's hard to tell
engineers from technicians, and, you know, it doesn't seem to
matter. It's just labor and management on the same team.''
   ``It's like a marriage,'' said Mike Bennett, UAW Local 1853
president at Saturn. ``You make vows. Fidelity is a matter of
choice. Both GM and the UAW are working to make this marriage
work.''

   But not everyone believes the parties should be married.
   ``Why should we work together on speeding up assembly lines,
pitting workers against each other as the team concept does?'' said
Tucker, of New Directions. ``Why should we aid corporations
whipsawing one plant against the other?''
   By trying to get along, he said, grievances aren't filed and
safety may be jeopardized.
   ``The `I'm your pal, you're my pal' - it's almost a California
New Age philosophy implanted in the industrial heartland,'' said
Harley Shaiken, professor of work and technology at the University
of California-San Diego. ``It raises expectations about
participatory democracy. If those expectations aren't met, then the
situation can become very conflict-ridden very early.''
   At Janesville, cooperation has grown through the years, ranging
from abolishing separate worker-manager parking lots to more
drastic changes like a four-day workweek and elimination of dozens
of restrictive job classifications.
   GM brought in consultants to talk with workers about on-the-job
problems and sent rank-and-file employees to Michigan to help on
truck prototypes.
   Labor and management now lobby for state funds and meet
suppliers and dealers together. ``We want them to know this is the
way we operate,'' Spitzley said.
   ``It used to be you'd say something to management and they'd say
`I'm the boss. You're the worker.' Now what they do is we sit down
and talk about the problem,'' said John Resch, an autoworker for 20
years at the plant.
   ``For us to survive, it takes both of us to do it together.''

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Vernon Savings Association owner Don R.
Dixon blamed his employees for wrongdoing at the failed thrift as
testimony ended in his bank fraud trial Tuesday.
   ``I thought they were loyal at the time,'' said Dixon, who took
the stand for the third time.
   Dixon is charged with 38 counts of bank fraud, misapplication of
funds, conspiracy and other crimes. He is accused of using Vernon
money for prostitutes, personal beach homes in California and
illegal political contributions.
   Dixon bought the small-town thrift in 1981 and its assets grew
more than tenfold by the time he sold it in 1986.
   The following hear, Vernon failed at a cost to taxpayers of more
than $1.2 billion. It was one of the first costly collapses of the
thrift crisis and focused national attention on the troubled
industry.
   Federal prosecutors and defense attorney Billy Ravkind were
scheduled to present closing arguments Wednesday before the case
goes to the jury. If convicted on all counts, Dixon could be
sentenced to up to 190 years in prison and fined as much as $9.5
million.
   The trial began in mid-October and included more than four weeks
of testimony from about 25 prosecution witnesses and a handful for
the defense.
   Dixon took the stand in his own behalf Friday, Monday and for
about 30 minutes Tuesday. He finished by repeating his contention
that he did not authorize Vernon officers to reimburse themselves
with Vernon funds for donations to political candidates.
   He said he gave ``conditional'' approval, telling the executives
to check with attorneys before reimbursing themselves.
   ``If those officers had thought it was illegal, not one of them
told me,'' Dixon said.
   Later, prosecutors recalled one witness, George McGuffey, who
was Dixon's loan officer at Republic Bank in Dallas for eight
years.
   McGuffey disputed Dixon's testimony that Republic allowed him to
redirect money it loaned him from one project to another. He also
said Dixon would have had to document any use of Republic's money
for purposes other than what it was borrowed for.
   McGuffey also said Republic did not make financial agreements on
a handshake, as Dixon said he did with a Dallas developer
concerning payments on a $1 million beach house near San Diego.
   Prosecutors contend Dixon developed an elaborate scheme using
developer James Atkinson to pay for the house, preventing its
discovery by federal regulators.

<HEAD>Testing of Electronic Trading System to Begin in Spring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The testing of Globex, an electronic global
trading system developed by Chicago's futures exchanges, will get
underway at the end of the first quarter of next year, a spokesman
for one of the exchanges said Tuesday.
   Globex is being developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
the Chicago Board of Trade and Reuters Holdings PLC. It will link
investors in North America, Europe and Asia through an electronic
system for trading futures and options contracts.
   It will operate during hours when the Mercantile Exchange and
Board of Trade trading floors are closed.
   Andrew Yemma, a spokesman for the Mercantile Exchange, said the
testing of Globex will involve about 250 terminals stationed in
Chicago, New York and London.
   ``The goal of the testing is to make sure the system performs
totally up to its capabilities before it is placed into service,''
Yemma said.
   The results of the testing will determine the actual launch date
for Globex.
   Yemma said negotiations are continuing between the exchanges and
Reuters for a final agreement on operating the system. When an
agreement is finalized, it will be submitted to the exchanges'
membership for approval.
   Globex was the idea of the Mercantile Exchange. After initial
opposition, the Board of Trade decided earlier this year to join
the Merc in developing the system, abandoning plans to develop its
own 24-hour electronic trading system.
   Reuters, a British news agency and disseminator of financial
news and market information, is providing the technical expertise.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, with the soybean market
getting some support from an expected increase in business from the
Soviet Union.
   There was little news to influence the market, said Joel Karlin,
an analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago. He said
traders used the day to consolidate gains made in Monday's trading,
which saw the market climb sharply.
   Soybean futures were pressured by a decline in the price of
soybean and soymeal on the European market.
   However, soybean futures received a boost from expectations of
increased soymeal demand from the Soviets. The first quarter of
1991 could see the Soviet Union importing about 10 million metric
tons of grain from foreign producers. Wheat futures were pushed
lower by reports of large worldwide supplies and aggressive
overseas competition.
   Corn futures were lower on pressure from commercial house
selling.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 3{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.45 a bushel; corn was 2{
cents lower to \ cent higher with December at $2.28 cents a bushel;
oats were 1 cent to 2\ cents lower with December at $1.11{ a
bushel; soybeans were 5\ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with
January at $5.96 a bushel.

   Stock prices retreated this afternoon, with
blue-chip issues leading the way down.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which gained 5.94 points
Monday after adding 40.84 points on Friday, was down 15.09 at
2,550.50 with one hour left in the session.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 8 to 7 on the
NYSE, with 687 up, 806 down and 479 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 137.77 million shares as of 3 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   The market moved lower at the outset in what market watchers
said was a reaction to a decline on key markets overseas. Stocks
slumped overnight in Tokyo and ended lower in London as well.
   But prices recovered their declines by midday and moved higher
before withering once again at midafternoon.
   Analysts said the market's weakness reflects an underlying
anxiety about the domestic economy, which by many assessments has
fallen into recession and dimmed the outlook for corporate profits
early next year.
   Uncertainties over the world trade talks in Europe and the
consequences of planned U.S.-Iraqi negotiations to avert war in the
Persian Gulf also weighed on the market.
   Bank stocks were among the most actively traded issues, rising
on word that the Federal Reserve was easing reserve requirements to
stimulate lending and ease a credit crunch hurting the economy.
   Citicorp rose 1&lsqb; to 14, Chase Manhattan rose &rsqb; to 11&rsqb;, and
BankAmerica rose ~ to 23~. First Bank System was the most active
issue on the NYSE, rising | to 13{.
   NCR, target of a takeover bid by AT&amp;T, rose 2 to 83{. AT&amp;T was
unchanged at 30&lsqb;.
   Continental Airlines led the Amex's most-active list, dropping \
to 1}. The debt-laden carrier filed for bankruptcy court protection
on Monday.
   In the over-the-counter market the most active issue was MCI,
down | to 18| with more than 2.9 million shares traded.
   Among broader market barometers, the New York Stock Exchange
index of all listed stocks fell 0.44 to 176.63. On the American
Stock Exchange, the market-value index fell 0.31 to 302.29.

   Continental Airlines is using comedians to
lighten the atmosphere on some flights this week, but they're not
allowed to make jokes about the company's bankruptcy court filing.
   Peter Bales, one of five comics chosen, said the airline's
financial troubles were the least of his worries. Turbulent skies
on the Newark-New Haven, Conn., route on Monday forced the stand-up
comedian to deliver his 10-minute shtick sitting down.
   ``It's difficult to be funny when you're try not to vomit,''
Bales said in a telephone interview Tuesday from his home in
Northport, N.Y.
   On Monday, the airline said it would continue normal operations
while it seeks protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy laws. The nation's fifth-largest airline said a
$2.2 billion debt and increased jet fuel costs due to the Persian
Gulf crisis forced the move.
   Continental first served up cabin comedy on its
Detroit-Cleveland route in August, said spokeswoman Nancy Compel.
   This week, its Continental Express division is offering stand-up
comedians and business speakers on its 46-seat commuter service to
New Haven - the serious stuff in the mornings and the funny stuff
in the afternoons.
   The promotion was hatched two months ago and will continue
despite the bankruptcy proceedings, Continental said.
   ``It's going well,'' Compel said Tuesday. ``Travelers seem to
enjoy it, even though it was a little bit rough and our comedian
had to sit down.''
   The comedians were advised last week to keep the cabin humor
clean and not make jokes about airplanes.
   On Monday, Compel said, she ``told them the news of the day''
and reminded them to ``stay away from inappropriate material.''
   Bales said he avoided negative airline jokes, but added that he
generally says what he wants.
   He began by warning hecklers they would be asked to leave. Then
he griped about the gig, saying there were ``two guys with
headphones'' in his dressing room.
   The jokes were delivered while he was strapped into his seat,
with his head craning down the aisle to catch a glimmer of response
over the noisy engines.
   ``I thought at one point I got applause but I think my ears were
just popping from the pressure,'' he said.

   A late burst of buying sparked by rumors that
Iraq was considering withdrawing from Kuwait lifted the stock
market to its third consecutive gain today.
   The market's major indicators were trading well below Monday's
closing levels late in the session when rumors swept the market
that Iraq had come up with a new proposal to withdraw from Kuwait.
   The rumors, based on a British television news report, fanned
speculation the Persian Gulf crisis could be resolved without
bloodshed.
   Up until those reports circulated in the last half hour of
trading, the market was generally lower on what analysts attributed
chiefly to profit-taking in the wake of a big gain on Friday and a
smaller advance on Monday.
   Bank stocks were doing well, however, in the wake of today's
anouncement by the Federal Reserve that it was easing reserve
requirements to stimulate lending and ease a credit crunch hurting
the economy.

   D. Leonard Wise was elected chairman and
chief executive officer of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. Tuesday,
succeeding William J. Scharffenberger, the company said.
   Wise, 56, has been vice chairman since April 23 and a member of
the board since January 1988. He has been involved in the steel
industry for 33 years.
   James L. Wareham will continue as president and chief operating
officer, the nation's eighth-largest steelmaker said.
   Scharffenberger, whose resignation was effective Tuesday, will
continue as the ``responsible officer'' in leading the company from
Chapter 11 status in compliance with a June 1987 bankruptcy court
order, the company said.
   Scharffenberger said the timing of his resignation would help
accomplish ``a smooth transition from the `old' company to the
`new' company under the plan or reorganization.''
   The company and the United Steelworkers union reached settlement
in mid-August on a contract that expires March 1, 1994. The
agreement was seen as a key to allowing the company to emerge from
Chapter 11 status after five years.
   The Wheeling-based company employs 5,500 union workers and 1,600
non-union workers in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.

<HEAD>Paul Loses Bid to Keep from Paying $30.8 Million Restitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted CenTrust Chairman David Paul, a national
symbol of excess in the savings and loan crisis, lost his bid
Tuesday to keep from paying $30.8 million in restitution sought by
federal regulators.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Davis rejected Paul's motion for a
temporary injunction to hold off the Office of Thrift Supervision.
   But Paul attorney Sanford Bohrer promised an appeal even before
seeing the opinion, saying, ``What OTS did doesn't bear any
resemblance to what the constitution requires.''
   Davis' ruling did not address a deadline for Paul to pay up, but
OTS attorney Deborah Siegel said, ``Hypothetically, the order has
always been in force and the bond is due.''
   Thrift regulators ordered Paul to submit the bond by Nov. 1 to
cover CenTrust funds converted to his personal use, but payment was
delayed by Paul's appeal.
   OTS targeted a $15 million legal defense fund for the failed
savings &amp; loan's officers and directors, sumptuous furnishings and
fixtures at CenTrust's 47-story office tower, Old Masters paintings
and a private dinner cooked by European chefs flown in for the
occasion.
   Paul, CenTrust's majority stockholder until the Resolution Trust
Corp. became conservator last February, faces numerous civil suits
over his control of Florida's once-largest thrift. No criminal
charges have been filed against him.
   Great Western Savings has acquired most of CenTrust's branches,
but its headquarters and money-losing projects remain in federal
hands. The federal takeover already has cost an estimated $1.8
billion.
   Bohrer attacked the restitution order as ``an Alice in
Wonderland approach to due process'' that reached a judgment
against Paul without allowing him to defend himself.
   ``What OTS as done is they've talked to themselves and said,
`We should win this lawsuit, shouldn't we?' and declared themselves
the winner,'' he said after learning of the ruling. ``No proof or
nothing.''
   Bohrer said Paul was in Miami but would not make any comment.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Surge Despite Reports of Middle East Negotiations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices rebounded Tuesday from steep declines of
the past two trading sessions, shrugging off reports the Kuwaitis
were willing to enter into negotiations with the Iraqi on
withdrawal from Kuwait.
   On other markets, grains were lower and soybeans higher;
precious metals gained; and livestock and pork futures were lower.
   Analyst Brian Tagler of Shearson Lehman Bros. Inc. said energy
futures were stronger on New York's Mercantile Exchange because of
a fire in the Saudi Arabian oilfield and nervousness over an
upcoming OPEC meeting.
   The market sold off at mid-session on news the Kuwaiti royal
family may be willing to hand over two islands in exchange of Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait. However, the market later recovered from
the losses and moved higher.
   ``It is an indication that the market is in a bullish stage,''
Tagler said.
   Light sweet crude settled 95 cents to $1.51 higher with the
contract for delivery in January at $30.66 a barrel; heating oil
was 1.63 cents to 2.23 cents higher with January at 86.90 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was 2.40 cents to 3.85 cents higher with
January at 75.92 cents a gallon.
   Grain futures prices settled lower and soybeans were higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade, with the soybean market getting some
support from an expected increase in business from the Soviet
Union.
   There was little news to influence the market, said Joel Karlin,
an analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago. He said
traders used the day to consolidate gains made in Monday's trading,
which saw the market climb sharply.
   Soybean futures were pressured by a decline in the price of
soybean and soymeal on the European market.
   However, soybean futures received a boost from expectations of
increased soymeal demand from the Soviets. The first quarter of
1991 could see the Soviet Union importing about 10 million metric
tons of grain from foreign producers.
   Wheat futures were pushed lower by reports of large worldwide
supplies and aggressive overseas competition.
   Corn futures were lower on pressure from commercial house
selling.
   Wheat was 2\ cents to 3{ cents lower with December at $2.44} a
bushel; corn was \ cent to 2 cents lower with December at $2.28\ a
bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2\ cents lower with December at $1.11{
a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to 2{ cents higher with
January at $6.01\ a bushel.
   Precious metals prices were higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange, with gold pushed higher by renewed Middle East war fears.
The fears were spurred by more militant tones in remarks President
Bush made Tuesday in Montevideo, Uruguay. The president said he did
not believe economic sanctions would force Iraq out of Kuwait.
   Gold was $1.80 to $2.30 higher with December at $378.90 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.3 cents to 1.4 cents higher with December at
$4.151 a troy ounce.
   Live hog futures were sharply lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, with selling interest spurred by lower cash hog prices
and expectation of further price declines, said Paul Georgy of
Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   Frozen pork belly prices were pushed lower by an expected sharp
increase of bellies in storage.
   Live cattle futures were pushed lower by commodity fund selling
and spillover weakness in the hog market.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .28 cent lower with December at
78.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .30 cent lower
with January at 87.32 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to
1.32 cents lower with December at 49.30 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.85 cents to 2 cents lower with February at 63.90
cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Tuesday affirmed a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that ordered the LTV Corp. to re-assume
liability for nearly $3 billion in employee pension plans it
stopped funding in 1987.
   The Dallas steel, aerospace and energy concern, which is in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, had opposed restoring the
plans because it claimed such a move could possibly force the
company to liquidate.
   LTV lawyers had argued that the high court decided only legal
issues regarding events that were three years old and had not taken
into account the company's current financial situation.
   Attorneys for LTV's various creditors also had urged against
returning liability to the company, arguing that it could disrupt
LTV's attempts to reorganize.
   But U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet of Manhattan rejected the
company's and creditors' position and granted a request by the
federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. to make LTV take back
responsibility for the pension plans.
   In his 22-page decision, Sweet said: ``In view of the Supreme
Court's holding, PBGC is entitled to attempt to restore the plans
before determining the effect or propriety of such action.''
   The PBGC insures pension benefits, much like the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. insures bank deposits.
   The high court's June ruling upheld PBGC's decision to force
LTV's Cleveland-based steel unit, LTV Steel Corp., to re-assume
pension obligations for three underfunded plans. Those plans were
to provide for more than 60,000 LTV retirees and active employees.
   Sweet's decision means liability for the three funds will be
transferred to LTV from the PBGC.
   ``With today's order, LTV can now take the necessary steps to
complete its bankruptcy reorganization and emerge as a viable
company while workers and retirees can have their full pensions as
originally promised,'' said PBGC executive director James B.
Lockhart.
   LTV spokesman Charles M. Palmer said the company would continue
to make payments from the pension plans.
   ``Because we're in Chapter 11 we can't put any additional money
into the pension funds, so future pensions will be paid from
existing assets of the three plans,'' Palmer said.
   Last month, the PBGC issued a proposed payment schedule for the
restored plans that would allow LTV to pay its unfunded pension
liabilities over a 30-year period.
   ``We believe the proposal is not workable but we would expect to
have more discussions in the future,'' Palmer said.
   Sweet conceded that his order left unresolved ``the survival of
LTV and the means by which the benefits under its pension plans are
to be paid.''
   The judge recommended that all parties involved in the dispute
select an arbitrator to address these problems.
   ``The difficulty of these issues has engaged, and to date,
defeated the best efforts of administrators, judges and legislators
at all levels,'' Sweet wrote. ``Perhaps all parties should agree
than an instance-specific global solution would be preferable to
the continuation of the present trench warfare.''
   LTV filed for protection from its creditors in July 1986.
   The litigation stems back to 1987 when LTV stopped funding the
pension plans and the PBGC assumed liability.
   A few months later, a new LTV labor contract with the United
Steelworkers of America restored some retirement benefits similar
to those in the terminated plans.
   The PBGC ordered LTV to re-assume liability for the three
terminated plans. When LTV challenged the order, PBGC went to
court.
   In 1988, Sweet ruled that the agency improperly ordered LTV to
re-assume the plans' operations. A year later, a federal appeals
court agreed that PBGC had exceeded its legal authority.
   But the Supreme Court reversed the lower courts and sided with
the PBGC.

<HEAD>Report that Iraq May Withdraw from Kuwait Triggers Stock Rally</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A report that Iraq may be ready to withdraw from
Kuwait peacefully triggered a powerful rally in the stock market on
Tuesday, lifting key market indicators to their third consecutive
advance.
   The news that suggested the Persian Gulf crisis could be
resolved without an armed conflict between Iraq and the
multinational military force led by the United States ignited a
market that sank gradually for much of the afternoon.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which was down more
than 25 pouints with a half hour left in the session, finished with
a gain of 14.11 points to close at 2,579.70.
   That represented a turnaround of about 40 points in only 30
minutes.
   ``This is a news headline type of market,'' said Larry Wachtel,
a market analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities. He said the
report ``turned market psychology around'' even without official
confirmation.
   But he warned that if the report proves inaccurate, the market
could reverse course just as quickly.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
907 up, 639 down and 457 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 185.82 million
shares, up from 177.07 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 227.06 million shares.
   News of a British satellite television report that Iraq would be
willing to withdraw from Kuwait in as long as it was not attacked
and could keep the disputed Rumailah oil field triggered the rally
at about 3:30 p.m. EST.
   Wachtel said the report triggered buying in the futures markets,
which in turn set off a scramble to buy the stocks on which stock
index futures contracts are based.
   But Wachtel and several other analysts said that the stock
market faces some tough going, given the depressed state of the
economy and the damaging effect that that may have on corporate
profits.
   ``The market is getting a little tired,'' Dennis Jarrett, chief
market analyst at Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., said before the late
turnaround.
   He said the market's early decline reflected profit-taking in
the wake of last week's 32 point-plus advance in the Dow Jones
industial average.
   That advance had included gains of 40.84 points in the Dow
industrials on Friday and another 5.94 point rise on Monday.
   Bank stocks got a lift Tuesday from the Federal Reserve's
announcement that it was reducing reserve requirements in an effort
to encourage more bank lending.
   First Chicago Corp. was the most active issue on the NYSE,
rising 1 to 18}.
   Citicorp gained 1{ to 14&rsqb;, Chase Manhattan rose { to 11{,
BankAmerica climbed 1{ to 24{ and First Bank System rose ~ to 13}.
   NCR rose 2 to 83{. On Sunday, AT&amp;T said it was offering to buy
NCR for $90 a share, but NCR has indicated it wants to remain
independent. AT&amp;T rose \ to 30&rsqb;.
   Continental Airlines led the Amex's most-active list, dropping \
to 1}. The debt-laden carrier filed for bankruptcy court protection
on Monday.
   In the over-the-counter market the most active issue was MCI,
down { to 18} with more than 4.6 million shares traded.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $20.71 billion, or 0.68
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.12 to 178.19.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.88 to 381.93, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index climbed 2.25 to 326.35.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
2.78 to 364.10. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 302.64, up 0.04.

   Oil prices rallied on the futures market
Tuesday, then a news report indicating Iraq might vacate Kuwait
pushed crude down sharply.
   Light sweet crude, the benchmark grade, settled at $30.66 a
barrel, up $1.51, at the New York Mercantile Exchange on contracts
for January delivery. Later contract months all settled higher,
mostly by more than $1 per barrel.
   But soon after the Mercantile Exchange had closed for the day,
oil traders were jolted when they received word of a British
television news report indicating that Iraq might have a plan for
pulling its army out of Kuwait.
   Sky television news said Iraq might be ready to withdraw from
most of Kuwait as long as it is allowed to keep the disputed
Rumailah oil field and as long as it gets a guarantee that Western
forces will not attack.
   Prices for petroleum at loading platforms and docks, commonly
called the cash or spot market, tumbled by more than $1 per barrel
minutes after the Mercantile Exchange closed, traders said. The
cash market ordinarily follows the bahavior of prices at the
exchange, which is known as the futures market.
   ``That's a lot,'' said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy analyst
with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J. ``They
usually don't move as dramatically as on the futures market,
because it's not an open cry system.''
   In early afternoon trading on the Mercantile Exchange, oil
prices had fallen on a report indicating Kuwait might be willing to
negotiate the future of some of its islands if Iraq withdraws its
troops, which invaded the oil-rich emirate on Aug. 2.
   ``But it did not continue to sell off. In fact it snapped back
up,'' said Brian Tagler, a broker with Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc. ``Everybody interpreted that as as a very bullish event, the
fact that the market did not collapse.''
   Crude oil futures shot up nearly $2 above their lows for the
day, puzzling many traders.
   Once the market was closed, they began trying to piece together
what had happened before news of the British television report came
in and they began nervously watching the cash market. Financial
markets that were still open at that point made sharp moves on the
possibility of peace in the Gulf.
   Futures prices for refined petroleum products had moved pretty
much in tandem with crude prices Tuesday.
   Home heating oil rose 2.23 cents to 86.90 cents a gallon on
contracts for delivery in January. Unleaded gasoline for January
delivery rose 2.40 cents to 75.92 cents a gallon.
   Natural gas prices, which are not directly affected by the
potential for Mideast war, fell 3.5 cents, to $2.44 per 1,000 cubic
feet, on contracts for delivery in January.
   Later Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported that
the nation's supply of crude oil fell last week to 335.5 million
barrels, down from 337.1 million barrels a week earlier and 351.9
million barrels a year earlier.
   The stockpile of gasoline was at 221.1 million barrels, up from
218.3 million barrels a week earlier but down from 223.1 million
barrels a year earlier, API said in its weekly report. The
stockpile of distillates, which include home heating oil, totaled
132.9 million barrels, down from 134.8 million barrels a week
earlier but up from 121.5 million barrels a year earlier, API said.

   The conviction of Robert Morris for unleashing a
computer ``worm'' program in 1988 should be overturned because he
didn't intend to paralyze thousands of computers linked to a
nationwide program, his attorney told an appeals court Tuesday.
   The oral arguments in Morris' appeal were presented to three
judges of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, who didn't
immediately make a decision.
   Morris, 25, of Arnold, Md., was the first person brought to
trial under a section of a 1986 federal computer fraud and abuse
law that makes it a felony to break into a federal computer network
and prevent authorized use of the system.
   The former Cornell University student was convicted at trial and
sentenced to three years probation, 400 hours of community service
and a $10,000 fine.
   The appeal presentations of defense attorney Thomas Guidoboni
and the prosecutor, Justice Department attorney Ellen Meltzer,
focused on their different interpretations of the law, which a
federal jury in Syracuse found Morris violated.
   Morris' worm immobilized an estimated 6,000 computers linked to
the Internet network, including ones at NASA, military facilities
and major universities. Witnesses testified that it did not
permanently harm the computers or computer files, but in some cases
victims were unable to use their computers for several days while
the worm was hunted down and removed from their computers.
   Morris testified during his trial that he had made a programming
error that caused the worm to go berserk and cripple the Internet
system on Nov. 2, 1988.
   He said he did not intend to cause permanent damage to computer
files - only to infiltrate the network's security.
   In court Tuesday, Guidoboni said he interpreted the computer
fraud law to mean that the government had to prove that Morris not
only intended to access the computer program but also planned to
interrupt access for others.
   He said there was insufficient evidence to support his
interpretation of the statute.
   The lawyer also claimed Morris did not break into computers
illegally, but rather merely exceeded authority already given to
him for computer access.
   Meltzer, however, argued that the conviction should stand
because the language of the law explicitly stated that proof that a
hacker intended to cause damage or loss to others was not required.
   The appeals court will issue a written opinion at a later date.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Gold Prices Close Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply against other major
currencies Tuesday, hit hard by the Federal Reserve's decision to
ease its grip on interest rates and by a news report that Iraq may
be willing to withdraw from Kuwait.
   Gold prices were mixed, falling overseas and then rising in New
York.
   The dollar first slumped after the Fed said it was relaxing its
reserve requirements for banks, an unusual move aimed at
stimulating the deteriorating economy by easing a shortage of
credit.
   The central bank said its action, the first change in reserve
requirements since 1983, was taken in part for technical reasons
but also to encourage banks to increase lending.
   Ideally, if banks have more money to lend, interest rates would
fall, although some private economists questioned whether that
would in fact be the result of the Fed move. But the foreign
exchange markets, taking no chances, sold the dollar down.
   The dollar, like all currencies, draws support from higher
interest rates, which make U.S. investments more attractive. When
rates fall, the dollar tends to follow suit.
   The U.S. currency took another hit shortly before the close of
trading, after a British news report said Iraq may be ready to
withdraw from most of Kuwait as long as it is allowed to keep the
disputed Rumailah oil field.
   The report raised the prospects for a peaceful end to the Middle
East crisis. The dollar, seen as a relatively safe investment in
times of international strife, has advanced as tensions increased
in recent months and dropped as they were defused.
   James T. McGroarty, senior vice president with Greenwich Capital
Markets Inc., noted that the dollar stormed higher last week as the
Persian Gulf situation appeared to worsen. That surge upward made
the dollar particularly vulnerable to a sharp decline, he said.
   The British pound rose against the dollar Tuesday. In New York,
sterling closed at $1.92925, up from $1.9180 late Monday. In London
earlier, the pound rose to $1.9255 from $1.9205 late Monday.
   The dollar fell to 133.30 Japanese yen in New York from 134.735
late Monday In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose 1.35 yen to a
closing 134.35 yen, and it was later quoted in London at 134.00
yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late
quotes, included: 1.5030 German marks, down from 1.51395; 1.2825
Swiss francs, down from 1.2935; 5.0825 French francs, down from
5.1135; 1,129.25 Italian lire, down from 1,138.00; and 1.16325
Canadian dollars, down from 1.16625.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.5030 German marks, down from 1.5125; 1.2840 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2915; 5.0835 French francs, down from 5.1113;
1.6955 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7055; 1,130.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,137.00; and 1.1638 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1655.
   Gold advanced in New York, climbing $2.30 on the Commodity
Exchange to close at $378.90 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank
later quoted a bid of $376.25, up 75 cents.
   Gold fell earlier in London to a late bid price of $378.20 a
troy ounce from $380.50 late Monday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a
closing bid of $377.40 from $380.85 late Monday.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell $3.37 to close at a bid $376.69.
   Silver prices advanced. The metal rose 1.3 cents on the
Commodity Exchange, closing at $4.151 a troy ounce. Earlier, silver
rose in London to a late bid price of $4.18 a troy ounce from
Monday's $4.16.

   Sales of new homes dropped 3.5 percent in
October to the lowest level in eight years, the government reported
Tuesday. But analysts said the free fall may be bottoming out and
sales should begin rebounding by spring.
   ``Sales should be leveling off at this number in the fourth
quarter and the first quarter of next year,'' assuming mortgage
rates continue to fall and the Mideast problem is resolved, said
economist David G. Seiders of the National Association of Home
Builders.
   Economist Mark Obrinsky of the Federal National Mortgage
Association suggested sales may zig-zag for several months, ``but
assuming no blowup in the Middle East ... I expect to see a more
sustained pickup by spring of 1991.''
   Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 491,000, the
Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development said in a
joint release. That was the lowest since 480,000 new homes were
sold in October 1982, a month before the 1981-82 recession ended.
   So far this year, new home sales were off 15.8 percent from the
same period of 1989.
   Sales fell 4 percent in September and 2 percent in August. The
September figure was revised down from 6 percent in the
departments' initial estimate, but the October total was worse than
the 1.8 percent drop first reported.
   Obrinsky said the main reason for the decline ``is great
consumer uncertainty and generally negative buying sentiment.''
   Consumers, he said, are experiencing rising prices caused by the
Persian Gulf crisis and increasing unemployment as the economy
slows.
   ``But, really, the big one is the great uncertainty over the
Mideast ... concern over war breaking out,'' Obrinsky added.
   At the October sales pace, it would take 8.4 months to exhaust
the inventory of unsold homes, up from 8.3 months in September.
There was a seven-month supply of unsold homes in October 1989.
   But Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers
Association, said builders are cutting back on housing starts to
counter the slow sales.
   And, ``once the market recovers, you're going to find relatively
few new homes,'' he said. That, in turn, will drive up prices which
have been declining recently.
   The median price of a new home in October was $121,800, up from
$112,900 in September but down from $123,000 a year ago. The median
means half of the homes cost more, half less.
   Seiders attributed the price increase to a hefty 47.4 percent
gain in sales in the Northeast which has the highest housing costs
in the nation. Sales there totaled an annual rate of 84,000 units
after falling 12.9 percent the previous month.
   Sales in all other regions fell, including a drop of 18.2
percent in the West, to 112,000 units. That was the lowest since
106,000 homes were sold in September 1982.
   In the Midwest, sales were off 11.7 percent, to 83,000 units -
the lowest since 74,000 homes were sold in August 1986. Sales
dropped 4.1 percent in the South, to 212,000 units.

   Here are sales results for the 10 major U.S.
automakers for third period of November 1990.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were eight selling days in the period this year and eight
selling days last year.
   For the month, there were 25 selling days this year and 25
selling days last year, and for the year so far, 282 selling days
this year and 281 selling days last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru, Isuzu and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic
and appear in this table separately and combined as transplant
cars.
   Mazda has begun selling sport-utility vehicles made in a Ford
plant in Kentucky.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign.

<HEAD>New York Investment Group Proposes Merger with DeSoto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sutton Holding Corp., a New York investment
group that has been pursuing DeSoto Inc., proposed acquiring the
manufacturer through a merger.
   In a letter to Des Plaines, Ill.-based DeSoto's board of
directors, Sutton Chairman William Spier proposed a merger in which
stockholders would get $4.25 per share in cash and securities.
   The securities would entitle shareholders to a pro rata share in
the proceeds from any dissolution of DeSoto's pension plans.
   ``This security could be distributed as a dividend to DeSoto
stockholders immediately prior to consummation of our
acquisition,'' Spier said in the letter, dated Dec. 3, which was
included in a Sutton filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   In October, DeSoto shareholders approved a plan to sell off most
of the company's assets and terminate its pension plans in return
for a one-time dividend of $35.50 per share.
   Under the restructuring the company would sell substantially all
of its businesses, including its domestic consumer paint business,
which has supplied Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. for 80 years.
   Only DeSoto's detergent business would be retained.
   DeSoto has estimated that the partial liquidation and
restructuring would raise about $222 million before taxes with $85
million earmarked to retire corporate debt.
   It noted that its plan to terminate pension plans and recover
some $28 million in excess assets is subject to approval by the
Internal Revenue Service and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.,
the federal agency that guarantees workers' pensions much like the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. guarantees bank deposits.

   Prices for stocks and bonds jumped sharply and
oil fell on the cash market in late afternoon trading Tuesday after
a British television report of an Iraqi withdrawal plan raced
through the financial markets.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip stocks, which was down
more than 25 points with a half hour left in trading, finished with
a gain of 14.11 points to close at 2,579.70.
   The move amounted to a turnaround of about 40 points in 30
minutes.
   Bond prices also moved higher. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year
bond closed up { point, or $5 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield,
which falls when prices rise, was down to 8.32 percent from 8.36
percent late Monday.
   ``This is a news headline type of market,'' said Larry Wachtel,
a stock market analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities. He said the
report ``turned market psychology around'' even without official
confirmation.
   But he warned that the market could reverse course just as
quickly if the report proved inaccurate.
   News of the British television report hit trading floors just
after 3:30 p.m. EST. Sky television news said Iraq might be ready
to withdraw from most of Kuwait as long as it was allowed to keep a
disputed oil field and as long as it received a guarantee that
Western forces would not attack.
   A multinational force of more than 400,000, led by the United
States, has been deployed in the region to oppose Iraq. Following
the passage of a U.N. resolution last week, Iraq has been given
until Jan. 15 to withdraw or face possible attack.
   The oil futures market had just closed when the Iraq report
reached U.S. financial markets, but the news pushed prices down on
the cash market, where the commodity is picked up and delivered.
   Prices for petroleum at loading platforms and docks, also called
the spot market, tumbled by more than $1 per barrel to below $30
minutes after the futures market closed.
   In futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light
sweet crude for January delivery had settled at $30.66 a barrel, up
$1.51. Prices on the cash market have closely followed those at the
exchange throughout the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Also Tuesday, some stock and bond prices were buoyed by the
Federal Reserve's loosening of bank reserve requirements.
   The Fed's move followed other important credit-easing steps by
the central bank, including a steady lowering of the federal funds
rate.
   ``This validates the view that the Fed is on a prolonged path of
easing. It doesn't initiate it; it strengthens it,'' said Richard
B. Hoey, managing director and chief economist at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Government Securities Inc.
   In the long-term, the progressive easing in credit conditions
could soften the negative effects of an economic slowdown and
potentially strengthen the stock market, some analysts said.

   Northwest Airlines is planning on retaining
its ranking as the nation's fourth largest carrier despite a spate
of setbacks the carrier has suffered in recent years.
   ``The public knows we run a safe airline and an airline of
integrity. These things can happen to any airline,'' Northwest
spokesman Doug Miller said after the latest disaster, a runway
collision Monday that left eight people dead at Detroit
Metropolitan Airport.
   In the past four years, Northwest has suffered through two
crashes, a takeover, bitter labor strife and the convictions of
three pilots for flying while intoxicated.
   Monday's runway collision came three years after Northwest
Flight 255 went down near the same airport, killing 156 people in
the second-worst air crash in U.S. history.
   In that Aug. 16, 1987, accident, the MD-80 failed to gain
altitude during takeoff and slammed into a highway overpass. The
National Transportation Safety Board ruled that the pilots didn't
set the plane's wing flaps and slats properly for takeoff and that
failure ff a cockpit warning device contributed to the crash.
   Northwest gained its fourth-place ranking, behind United
Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Airlines, after the
Eagan-based carrier acquired in-state rival Republic Airlines for
$884 million in August 1986.
   What followed was an epidemic of late flights and lost baggage
roundly attributed to union warfare that stemmed from pay
disparities. As union leaders fought the company for more than two
years to unify contracts, many former Republic workers were getting
paid less than their Northwest counterparts.
   By the time Los Angeles investor Al Checchi led a $3.65 billion
buyout completed Aug. 3, 1989, the airline was fighting to overcome
a new nickname: ``Northworst.''
   Checchi ushered in new management and improved service. The
airline in March 1988 already had scored points with some travelers
by banning smoking on all of its domestic flights - not just on
flights of two hours or less as federal rules mandated.
   But other problems mounted.
   On Dec. 28, 1989, Northwest publicized a bomb threat it received
for a Dec. 30 flight from Paris to Detroit. More than 100 people
canceled their reservations for the flight; 28 passengers and 14
crew members made the trip.
   On Jan. 4, 1990, an engine fell off a three-engine Northwest
plane flying from Miami to Minneapolis. The Boeing 727 landed
safely in Tampa, Fla. Federal officials said improper maintenance
was involved and proposed a $200,000 fine.
   Then on March 8, 1990, three Northwest pilots flying a Boeing
727 from Fargo, N.D., were arrested at Minneapolis-St. Paul
International Airport after authorities were alerted that the
pilots had been drinking heavily the night before. The three became
the first commercial pilots to be convicted for flying a jetliner
while intoxicated. Their sentences ranged from one year to 16
months.
   That was followed with a company report in October that ground
workers in Atlanta filled the hydraulic systems of two DC-9 jets
with a mixture of hand soap and hydraulic fluid. The airline said
it was a mistake. Fifty flights were canceled around the country
and 12 DC-9s were grounded for inspections.
   Checchi called a news conference Oct. 16 to say that layoffs and
a reduced flight schedule were imminent because of higher jet fuel
prices brought on by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   But at the same meeting, he told reporters the airline was in
good financial shape and positioned to possibly acquire another
airline, or part of another airline. The takeover debt stands at
$1.7 billion, two years ahead of schedule, and the company has cash
reserves of $1 billion available.
   Despite a 47 percent drop in its third-quarter earnings,
Northwest's market share in the first 10 months of this year was
11.7 percent, up 0.7 percent from the same period a year ago.
   Although Northwest and other U.S. carriers are expected to lose
a total of more than $1 billion in the fourth quarter, Checchi said
last week in an interview with the Star Tribune that he was content
with the airline's position.
   ``I feel that under circumstances we're in pretty good shape,''
he said. ``But it's nothing to crow about.''

<HEAD>Gasoline Prices Up, Largely Because of Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An increase in the federal gasoline tax pushed
up prices at the pump when they otherwise would have dropped, the
American Automobile Association said Tuesday.
   In its weekly survey, AAA found the average nationwide retail
price for a gallon of self-serve regular unleaded was up 2.1 cents
at $1.387 per gallon. It was just .1 cent less than the AAA's
highest recorded price of $1.388 per gallon just before the Easter
holiday in 1981.
   Self-serve unleaded had risen 31.2 cents a gallon since Aug. 1,
the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait and threw world oil markets into
a state of chaos, AAA said.
   AAA said gasoline prices would probably have fallen for the week
without the imposition of an additional 5.1-cent per gallon tax
that took effect Saturday. The average pump price was up in all
regions, AAA said.

<HEAD>Troubled Bank Reaches Settlement With SEC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The troubled Bank of New England Corp. has reached
an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over
allegations the firm failed to properly disclose financial
problems, bank officials said Tuesday.
   SEC commissioners were expected to vote this week on the
settlement. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed, and SEC
officials would not comment further.
   SEC staff had alleged the bank refused to acknowledge the
deterioration in its loan portfolio until December 1989, when
shareholders were told the bank would increase its loan-loss
reserves and cancel its quarterly dividend.
   The bank then posted a $1.1 billion loss for the year. But a
quarter earlier it reported a $42.7 million profit and $121.6
million in nine-month earnings.
   Bank of New England spokesman James Dorsey would not give any
details of the settlement but said the firm had cooperated fully
with the investigation.
   ``We've been discussing this settlement with the SEC staff,''
Dorsey said. ``We have agreed to a resolution whereby the company
would consent to an SEC enforcement proceeding.''
   Dorsey said the company had brought in new management since the
time of the allegations.
   ``The issues being reviewed relate to the firm's disclosures in
1989, and don't in any way involve matters during 1990, or our new
management team,'' he said. ``This relates to a different era and a
different time for this company, and we're pleased this is coming
to a resolution.''
   Bank of New England and its loan portfolio have been shaken by
bad loans made during the 1980s and by New England's recession. The
firm reported a $123.2 million loss in the third quarter, or $1.78
a share.
   Bank of New England is a Boston-based bank holding company with
assets of $23 billion. It has offices in Maine, Connecticut and
Rhode Island.

<HEAD>Defense Concedes Rule Violations But Denies Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defense attorney conceded Tuesday that a
soybean trader at the Chicago Board of Trade broke exchange rules
but said he did not attempt to cheat customers or commit fraud.
   The comments came during closing argumnents in the 11-week-old
trial of 10 soybean traders and brokers charged in a federal
investigation of alleged corruption at the Board of Trade and
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Attorney Jim Epstein called the government's evidence
insubstantial, conceded violations of Board of Trade rules and
vigorously denied charges of wire fraud, mail fraud and
racketeering conspiracy.
   ``Did he violate the rules? Absolutely,'' Epstein said of his
client, Martin J. Dempsey. ``Did he attempt to commit fraud?
Absolutely not.''
   Epstein told a federal court jury that testimony indicated many
of the rule violations were common on the trading floor and often
benefited customers for whom the defendants may have been trading.
   One such violation is curb trading, which occurs in the trading
pit in the seconds or minutes after the closing bell.
   ``Sure, he did curb trading,'' Epstein said of Dempsey. ``Is he
proud of it? No. Did he try to conceal it? Of course, he did - but
not because he was committing ... fraud, but because he was
breaking the rules.''
   The defense contended the prosecution wanted the jury believe
concealing the trades was a sign of trying to cheat customers.
``Other than breaking the rule, you're not cheating anyone,''
Epstein said.
   The attorney also contended that government witnesses lied and
presented misleading testimony.
   Earlier, in their closing arguments, prosecutors scoffed at the
idea that traders broke the rules to benefit customers.
   ``These men intended to get money from customers under false
pretenses,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Rotert said. ``They think
things like ethics, fairness and the law are a matter of context.''
   In all, 48 people have been indicted after FBI agents posed as
traders and secretly tape-recorded conversations.

   Ford Motor Co. said it has indefinitely laid off
about 2,000 workers at an assembly plant here because a strike in
Indiana has reduced the flow of parts.
   Workers who assemble Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable autos at the
plant learned of the layoffs Monday.
   The strike is at a Ford-owned warehouse in Munster, Ind., that
supplies bumpers, body panels and other parts to the assembly
plant. The United Auto Workers union called the strike Friday for
the 92 members at the plant seeking wage and benefit increases.
   Their contract expired Sept. 14, but work continued under an
extension of the pact.

<HEAD>Baltimore Walkout Ends; Philadelphia Strike Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Shipping cargo clerks in Baltimore ended a two-day strike
Tuesday after reaching a tentative contract agreement, while
negotiations continued to halt a longer walkout at ports in and
around Philadelphia.
   The strike by 415 clerks, who process paperwork for loading and
unloading cargo, had brought the Baltimore port to a near
standstill. Officials sai the workers were to return Wednesday.
   The clerks, members of International Longshoremen's Association
Local 953, walked out Monday after failing to reach agreement with
management over pension, health benefits and job security issues.
Details of the new 46-month pact were not available.
   A handful of ships was unloaded Monday but activity came to a
near stop Tuesday because clerks weren't there to operate gates and
process cargo. At a few locations, ship line managers and office
workers performed the work.
   In Philadelphia, negotiators for about 2,500 dockworkers and a
marine trade association continued talks Tuesday night in an
attempt to end their four-day strike.
   Eight ILA locals, representing about 2,000 dockworkers at ports
in Philadelphia, southern New Jersey and Wilmington, Del., went on
strike Saturday, a day after rejecting an offer by the Philadelphia
Marine Trade Association, an employers' group.
   The ports had been scheduled to receive 22 ships by Wednesday,
according to the Philadelphia Maritime Exchange, a trade group.
Some ships already have been diverted to other East Coast ports,
officials said.
   The dock workers' 14-month contract extension expired at
midnight Friday.
   The disputes came two weeks after ratification of a master ILA
contract and concerned local issues affecting work rules. Labor
agreements have been reached in New York; Hampton Roads, Va.,
including Norfolk; and in South Atlantic ports from North Carolina
to Florida.

   The Upjohn Co. and Biopure Corp. on
Tuesday signed an agreement to develop and market a human blood
substitute derived from cow hemoglobin.
   Under the agreement, Upjohn will pay $25 million for world
marketing rights for all Biopure's blood-related products. The
pharmaceutical firm also must foot the bill for pre-clinical and
clinical development of Hemopure, the blood substitute for use on
humans.
   Hemopure is awaiting Federal Drug Administration approval for
clinical testing, which has been completed for Oxyglobin, a blood
substitute for animals.
   ``Biopure has worked diligently over the past seven years to
develop a mammalian-based substitute for human and animal blood,''
said Carl Rausch, co-founder and chief executive officer of
Boston-based Biopure.
   ``The potential product for human use, when approved, will begin
to lessen the estimated 100 million-unit annual shortfall in human
blood,'' he said.
