   South Korea and the Soviet Union have
agreed to start passenger air service between each other's capitals
next month, the government announced today.
   The agreement marks a major step toward improving relations
between Seoul and Moscow, which have no diplomatic relations but
recently have expanded economic and non-political links.
   The Transportation Ministry announced that it has approved an
air accord that Korean Air concluded with the Soviet state
airliner, Aeroflot, in Moscow on Wednesday.
   The agreement will allow KAL to start its European service by
way of Moscow on March 25. All European-bound KAL flights now take
a longer route through Anchorage, Alaska, and the North Pole.
   Under the new agreement, one of KAL's 10 weekly European flights
will be allowed to stop over in Moscow, with the other nine passing
through Siberia and Moscow on their way to European cities.
   The agreement also will enable Aeroflot to launch two weekly
flights to Seoul beginning on March 26, the officials said.
   Reports said China and South Korea, which also have no
diplomatic relations, are negotiating to conclude an air accord
this year.

<HEAD>Uncertain Political Future Looms After Japan's Election</HEAD>

   National elections Sunday will likely leave the
government in the throes of the current legislative gridlock _
regardless of the winner, analysts say.
   Some say the paralysis could leave Japan without strong
leadership to bargain with the United States on trade disputes.
   Japan's leadership has been hamstrung in recent months by
opposition control of the upper house of Parliament and power
struggles within the governing party.
   Six political parties with widely differing agendas are
contending for the 512 seats in the lower house of Parliament in an
election expected to set the tone for Japan in the 1990s.
   The lower, more powerful part of Japan's two-chamber parliament
passes the budget and appoints the prime minister.
   All the party leaders speak of the need to negotiate to resolve
the legislative crisis after the election, but ``they agree on
little else,'' said an analysis in today's Yomiuri Shimbun, a
conservative national daily.
   Polls in the final week before the election predict the
governing Liberal Democratic Party will hold its majority, but
political analysts have not ruled out upsets because 30 percent or
more of voters were undecided.
   The conservative Liberal Democrats, in power since the party was
formed in 1955, lost control of the upper house last year after it
leaders were battered by a series of sex and bribery scandals and
an uproar over a new sales tax.
   Sunday's election is critical for Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu,
who lacks a firm power base within his own party. He became leader
of the governing party last summer after two prime ministers were
forced to step down because of scandals.
   Here are three possible scenarios in the post-election political
scene:
   _ If the Liberal Democrats come in short of a majority, Kaifu
will step down immediately. Former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe is
the widely favored candidate to replace Kaifu, but the opposition
camp is likely to try to appoint popular Socialist leader Takako
Doi as prime minister.
   Liberal Democrat Secretary-General Ichiro Ozawa said his party
will turn over the government to the opposition if it fails to win
a majority.
   ``As we are already short of a majority in the upper house, I
must admit the people's decision not to give us control of the
lower house would have an immeasurably important significance,'' he
told The Associated Press. ``If we lose in this election, we have
no choice but to turn over the government.''
   That would mean Japan could have a leftist-led coalition
government for the first time in more than four decades. But the
Socialists and centrist opposition parties failed to resolve policy
differences before the election, and it is uncertain whether they
could agree on coalition terms.
   Socialist Secretary-General Tsuruo Yamaguchi has said the
opposition camp will unite quickly if the parties win a majority in
the lower house.
   _ The Liberal Democrats may manage to stay in power by
attracting conservative independents even if the party itself falls
short of the 257 seats required for a majority.
   This would increase pressure on Kaifu to step down to take
reponsibility for the electoral loss, and the power struggle within
the party would probably intensify.
   _ If the Liberal Democrats win a clear majority, Kaifu is
expected to form a strong government of his own, unlike the present
one, which reflects the will of party elders.
   The first challenge for Kaifu will be to pass the budget by
April 1. The Liberal Democrats are committed to change the widely
unpopular 3 percent sales tax, while the opposition parties are
united in saying it should be abolished. The tax logjam in
Parliament, in the end, may also force Kaifu to step down.
   ``I would not be surprised if someone other than Kaifu ends up
going to the summit meeting in Houston in July,'' said Masaya Ito,
a political analyst.
   ``Either way, without strong and stable domestic leadership,
Japan will have a troublesome time in trade negotiations with the
United States, whose demands are expected to toughen after the
election,'' he said.

<HEAD>Artist Known for Cartoon-like Drawings Dies of AIDS</HEAD>

   Keith Haring, whose cartoon-like drawings
appeared in public spaces from New York City's subways to the
Berlin Wall, has died of AIDS. He was 31.
   Haring, who had been diagnosed with the AIDS virus more than a
year ago, died early Friday in his downtown Manhattan apartment,
said an assistant, Margaret Slabbert.
   Active in AIDS fund-raising, Haring returned from a European
trip a month ago and fell ill soon after.
   Haring's work, characterized by human and animal figures in an
energized setting, was admired worldwide and brought him a
lucrative business.
   Some in the art world denigrated the commercialization of his
art through T-shirts, posters and in advertising. But Haring said
that was part of the point.
   ``If commercialization is putting my art on a shirt so that a
kid who can't afford a $30,000 painting can buy one, then I'm all
for it,'' Haring said. ``Art is nothing if you don't reach every
segment of the people.''
   His critical reputation never matched his popularity.
   ``Keith Haring's work is obviously very seductive and immensely
attractive to a lot of people,'' said New York Times art critic
Michael Brenson. ``But there never seems to be any edge to it...I
don't care for it at all.''
   Haring's motifs _ a glowing baby, dancing figures, pyramids,
creatures with TV heads, barking dogs _ first appeared on blank
advertising space in New York's subways about 10 years ago.
   By 1983, Artnews was calling his work ``provocative,
far-reaching and uplifting.''
   Others called it the visual equivalent of rap or hip-hop music,
popular but not necessarily serious.
   Newsweek's Mark Stevens once called Haring's work ``fast food.
... It's a good time. It's boogeying on Saturday night. But great _
no.''
   In 1986, he painted a 300-foot mural on the Berlin Wall of a
chain of red and black human figures on a yellow background _
incorporating the flag colors of East and West Germany.
   His other murals include those at Children's Hospital in
Washington, D.C., Grady Hospital in Atlanta, Necker children's
hospital in Paris and the maternity ward of Princess Grace Hospital
in Monte Carlo.
   He did a great deal of work for free, including posters for the
anti-apartheid movement and anti-crack murals. One anti-drug mural
in East Harlem overlooking the FDR Drive on Manhattan is seen by
thousands of commuters each day.
   In 1986, Haring opened the Pop Shop, a store in the SoHo section
of Manhattan that sells products bearing his art, including
T-shirts, refrigerator magnets and inflatable toys.
   ``My shop is an extension of what I was doing in the subway
stations, breaking down the barriers between high and low art,'' he
said.
   His projects included painting rock star Grace Jones' entire
body for a poster and collaborating on a poster of model Brooke
Shields with photographer Richard Avedon.
   Haring was raised in Kutztown, Pa., and learned to draw from his
father, a supervisor at Western Electric. His formal training
consisted of two years as a handyman at the Pittsburgh Center for
the Arts, and two years at New York's School of Visual Arts. Andy
Warhol was his mentor.
   Mayor David Dinkins said Haring's ``death deprives the art
community and the city-at-large of a great creative force. In his
effort to bring art to communities throughout the city and, indeed,
around the world, Keith Haring demonstrated the openness of spirit
and commitment to creativity that defined his art.''
   A private cremation was planned, with a memorial service to be
scheduled at a later date.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Demand Talks for Release of Two Americans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas demanded negotiations
for the release of two U.S. citizens they kidnapped this week to
protest President Bush's visit to Colombia, a news report said.
   One other American was also reported captured by the guerrillas
to protest Bush's one-day visit Thursday for a regional drug
summit. Authorities said they had no word on the third American, a
Roman Catholic priest from Rochester, N.Y. Parishioners prayed for
his return.
   The television program 24 Hours said Friday night that relatives
of James Donnelly, one of the captives, were contacted by the
abductors. It said they demanded a committee be formed to negotiate
the terms to release Donnelly and fellow captive David Kent.
   The abductors did not provide details on the conditions they
would put forward during such talks, the report said. It also was
not clear who the abductors wanted on the committee.
   Donnelly, a 65-year-old mechanical engineer from Detroit, and
Kent, a 40-year-old school teacher from Indianapolis, were
separately kidnapped in the northwestern city of Medellin on
Tuesday.
   The pro-Castro National Liberation Front made public Friday
night a communique claiming responsibility for their abductions.
   Officials also blame the group for kidnapping the priest, the
Rev. Francisco Amico Ferrari. He was abducted Thursday in the
southwestern city of Cali.
   The guerrillas said the summit in the Colombian resort city of
Cartagena between Bush and the presidents of Colombia, Peru and
Bolivia was part of a design for ``the military control of our
(Colombian) territory.''
   The summit approved a joint fight by the four nations against
drug trafficking.
   A police spokesman contacted in Medellin by telephone said the
police knew nothing of the guerrillas' demands.
   Roman Catholic Church bishops in Cali issued a statement calling
for the abductors to release Amico.
   The bishops also condemned guerrilla bomb attacks Thursday at
two Mormon temples run by American pastors. Damages were estimated
at $12,000, but no injuries were reported.
   Medellin and Cali are homes to the drug cartels named after
them. The cartels are blamed for more than 80 percent of the
cocaine entering the United States.

   A sheriff fed up with months of
overcrowding at the county jail commandeered a National Guard
armory and said he will temporarily house prisoners there ``to keep
the peace.''
   Richard McCarthy, spokesman for the Hampden County Sheriff's
department, said the action taken Friday by Sheriff Michael Ashe
was ``a last resort. It's an extreme action to deal with a more
dangerous situation.''
   McCarthy said he expected the 15 minimum-security prisoners
taken to the armory's drill hall would be housed there at least
through the holiday weekend.
   State Secretary of Public Safety Charles V. Barry said Ashe was
notified that housing prisoners in the armory was illegal. He said
Ashe was subject to prosecution for criminal trespass and that he
would pursue legal action Tuesday if the prisoners were not removed.
   State offices will be closed Monday for Presidents' Day.
   ``This is no way to do business,'' Barry said. ``If you would
come to us to discuss the problem, we would see what we could do to
accommodate you.''
   In a directive sent to the brigadier commander of the
Massachusetts Army National Guard Armory, Ashe said, ``It appears
... there is an imminent danger of a breach of the peace due to
insufficient prison space in this county.''
   ``Reasonable and prudent steps must be taken in order to
preserve the peace and quell such danger,'' he said.
   McCarthy said the move was not symbolic and that Ashe believes
the armory could become an effective temporary prison, housing
about 100 prisoners. All 15 prisoners at the armory have less than
two months to serve, McCarthy said.
   ``This action is within my inherent power to keep the peace. I
take full responsibility for this action to protect my fellow
citizens,'' Ashe said.
   Friday's action followed a week of turmoil at the jail, which
had reached maximum capacity. The jail was built to hold 279
prisoners and is under federal orders to house no more than 500
inmates.
   Two deputy county sheriffs were detained for most of Wednesday
by Westfield District Judge Philip Contant after they refused to
take a prisoner back to the Hampden County Jail in Springfield on
Ashe's orders.
   Ashe didn't want the prisoners sent to the jail because it had
more than 500 inmates.
   Contant said Ashe was doing an admirable job under trying
circumstances, but insisted he would pursue contempt charges if
prisoners were denied entry to the jail.
   McCarthy said early release, late sentencing and sending
prisoners to other jails had failed to relieve congestion at the
jail. A new jail has been approved in nearby Ludlow, but that is
expected to take two to three years to build.
   State Sen. Brian Lees went to the armory, described as the size
of a large gymnasium, and said it was unclear whether Ashe had the
authority to take over the building.
   ``We're waiting to see if this is legal and whether it falls
under the guidelines of the constitution,'' he said.

   East Germany will tear down a 600-foot
section of the Berlin Wall near the Brandenburg Gate and allow
completely unhindered passage between the two sides of the city
there, West German television said.
   Since November, the East Germans have created numerous passage
points through the Berlin Wall but have retained nominal checks of
passports or identity cards.
   The section at the Brandenburg Gate will be the first section
without any official controls.
   ``The Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate will be torn down,''
the ZDF television network said Friday. ``East German border troops
will start the work on Monday.''
   ``There will then be unhindered passage between East and West
from the Reichstag to the Brandenburg Gate. There will not be a
fence there as originally planned.''
   The wall, for years a symbol of the division of Europe, was
built in 1961 to prevent East German laborers from leaving. A
popular uprising in East Germany last fall toppled the hard-line
leadership and forced the opening of the wall in November.

<TEXT>
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping of China today met
with the authors of Hong Kong's proposed constitution for Chinese
rule and called their work ``a masterpiece of creativity.''
   Many Hong Kong residents fear the new constitution will not
force China to keep its promises of allowing the capitalist system
to remain for 50 years after the 1997 takeover and of letting Hong
Kong exercise a high degree of autonomy.
   Confidence in China's pledges dropped dramatically after the
June 3-4 military crackdown on Beijing's pro-democracy movement.
The protests were widely supported in Hong Kong, a British colony
on China's southwestern coast.
   The 51-member constitutional committee, appointed in 1985 by the
Beijing government, completed the final draft of the document this
week. The plan, known as the Basic Law, now goes to China's
legislature, the National People's Congress, for approval.
   ``This is a historical event, not just for the present but for
the future, not just for the Third World but for all of mankind,''
Deng said. ``Such a document is a masterpiece of creativity.''
   Deng met once before with the drafting committee _ in April
1987, just after pro-democracy student protests of the winter of
1986-87.
   During that meeting, he emphasized the need for stability and
warned that after 1997 ``if (people) try to turn Hong Kong into a
base of opposition to the mainland in the name of `democracy' ....
we will definitely interfere.''
   He also said general elections and ``Western democracy'' were
not suitable for Hong Kong, while ``keeping certain power for the
central government will benefit Hong Kong and bring it no harm.''
   Under the Basic Law plan, only 20 of the 60 seats in Hong Kong's
legislature in 1997 will be directly elected in Hong Kong. That
number will increase to 30 by 2003.
   The plan includes clauses that allow China to declare a state of
emergency and ban contacts with foreign political groups.
   At today's meeting, Deng was accompanied by Premier Li Peng,
Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, President Yang Shangkun and
congress chairman Wan Li. They did not speak.
   Ji Pengfei, chairman of the drafting committee, said in his
closing remarks later in the morning that the plan ``reflects the
great thinking of (the) one- country, two-systems'' policy.
   He added that the task before the drafting committee now was to
``make the Basic Law a part of the popular feeling in Hong Kong.''
   In Hong Kong on Friday, news of passage of the final Basic Law
draft was greeted with renewed demands for rapid democratic change.
   About 1,500 students chanting pro-democracy slogans and carrying
placards marched to the Chinese diplomatic mission in protest.
   The government has announced plans to increase the pace of
democratic change next year.

   A mass of molasses oozed through two
blocks of Colorado's ``Sweetheart City'' after a storage tank
ruptured, forcing a kindergarten to close and blocking the
entrances of several businesses.
   Before the syrupy mess was identified, authorities took
precautions against what they thought was a potentially dangerous
chemical spill.
   No one was injured by the leak in the city of 30,000 about 50
miles north of Denver.
   Word of the mess reached authorities early Friday after a car
spun out of control on a slippery substance and ran into a ditch.
   City manager Mike Rock said two young men were in the vehicle
and ``one of them told me it was like hitting glare ice. His
windshield was so splattered with the stuff he couldn't see.''
   The molasses was steaming when it escaped but quickly thickened
in temperatures of 5 degrees below. It flowed down a busy street,
into an industrial park and on into an irrigation ditch where it
ran for another half-mile, said police Cpl. Al Sharon.
   ``It gives a whole new meaning to the term Sweetheart City,''
Sharon said.
   ``We have engineers on the scene trying to determine the best
way to clean up the spill,'' said Jack Fulton, director of
government relations for Western Sugar Co., owner of the molasses,
which is used as an animal-feed supplement. Fulton estimated
582,000 gallons of molasses had spilled.
   Rock said of the cleanup effort, ``maybe we need to bring in a
big bunch of pancakes.''

   Madras, a 300-pound white Bengal circus
tiger in Florida for the winter, had human-style root canals after
breaking his two lower fangs while gnawing on a bone.
   Bill Richardson, a DeLand dentist, had only worked on people
before, but was eager to aid the 2-year-old tiger's teeth.
   ``One interesting thing about this is when I was in dental
school, they'd say to you, `We're not going to teach you how to do
everything. We're going to teach you how to figure out how to do
everything,''' Richardson said.
   He performed the root canals outdoors Thursday, using a slab of
wood as an operating table. The cat was anesthetized and
Richardson, assisted by eight people, used forceps to remove the
dead tissue from inside the fangs. He filled the teeth with a
cement mixture and filed them with a buffer.
   Trainers with the Clyde Beatty and Cole Bros. Circus called the
dentist because they feared the cat would get an infection.
   Madras woke up about 30 minutes after the 50-minute operation a
little groggy but feeling no pain, Richardson said.

   An 18-month-old girl who was the nation's second
live-donor liver transplant recipient is back home in Tennessee.
   Sarina Jones' departure was delayed twice by snowstorms, but on
Friday she finally flew from Chicago to Memphis.
   She had received a portion of her father's liver Dec. 9 to
correct a potentially fatal disorder.
   Doctors at the University of Chicago Hospitals said when she was
released about a week ago that her recovery was coming along fine
and that she could expect to grow normally.
   After her discharge, she was staying at a Ronald McDonald House
during a transition period before returning to her Millington,
Tenn., home.
   A couple of weeks before Sarina's surgery, doctors at the
University of Chicago Hospitals performed the nation's first
live-donor liver transplant, this one on 21-month-old Alyssa Smith
of Texas. She, too, has returned home.

<HEAD>Researcher: Teen-age Childbearing Can Combat Poverty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study presented at a prestigious scientific
gathering challenges the commonly held view that teen-age pregnancy
is a scourge of the poor.
   The researcher, Arline T. Geronimus of the University of
Michigan, said Friday that pregnancy can lead to economic
improvement for teen-age girls and increase their chances of having
a healthy baby.
   The Children's Defense Fund, a research and advocacy
organization in Washington, D.C., disputed the finding and said it
would continue to battle teen-age pregnancy.
   ``If a 15- or 16-year-old becomes pregnant, there's no way
that's a smart thing,'' said the organization's Ray O'Brian. Early
motherhood locks poor women into poverty and poor academic
performance, he said.
   But Geronimus said in an interview: ``I think women in poverty
know what they're doing. There are social realities in the poor
that those of us doing research are unaware of.''
   Among her findings, presented at a meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science:
   _Infants in poverty-stricken communities are healthier if their
mothers are in their teens rather than their 20s, because poor
mothers are healthier when they are younger.
   _Teen-age mothers form alliances with the fathers' families _
even if they are not married _ that improve the mothers' economic
positions.
   _Teen-age mothers are free to earn a living in their 20s,
because their children are old enough to be cared for by other
family members.
   _The elevated death rate for children of poor black mothers
would become even higher if the women were encouraged to delay
childbirth.
   ``I would like to go on record today in opposition to the view
that teen childbearing is self-destructive, irrational or
anti-social behavior,'' Geronimus said.
   In a separate study, researchers reported that teen mothers were
no more likely to drop out of school than their childless
classmates.
   ``Simply altering the fertility patterns will not guarantee
social and economic well-being for young mothers,'' said the
researchers, Dawn Upchurch of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore
and James McCarthy of Columbia University in New York.
   Geronimus bases her findings on health statistics and on
anthropological investigations of poor rural and urban communities.
She said she has conducted extensive interviews with poor women in
a rural area in North Carolina and in Boston.
   She has also built on the work of anthropologist Carol Stack,
who found that poor teen-age women who have children get help,
including financial help, from the families of their children's
fathers.
   Stack also found that poor young women have been widely exposed
to child rearing and thus arrive at motherhood with realistic
expectations. The young women also receive help caring for the
children.
   Geronimus has shown that the health of poor black women
deteriorates much more rapidly than that of middle-class women. By
the time poor women reach their 20s, they may be in menial,
stressful jobs and are more likely to smoke and consume alcohol,
both of which are hazardous during pregnancy.
   She thinks the same is probably true for poor white women, but
she said those studies have not been done.
   Geronimus found that infant mortality was not increased among
the children of teen-age mothers.

   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today said
he plans to play down his highly publicized spat with Philippine
President Corazon Aquino and focus on ``the things that unite us''
during his critical talks next week in Manila.
   ``I would hope that any unpleasantness is minimized,'' Cheney
said during an interview aboard the U.S. Air Force jet carrying him
to this British colony from Seoul, South Korea.
   Cheney's schedule today included lunch with Hong Kong Gov. Sir
David Wilson. He planned to meet Sunday with the U.S. ambassador to
the Philippines, Nicholas Platt, before traveling to Manila on
Monday.
   Cheney last week decided to shorten his Philippine stay by a day
after Mrs. Aquino announced she would refuse to see him because of
anger over negative U.S. press coverage of her government and U.S.
payments for the use of six military bases in the Philippines.
   Cheney is on a two-week tour of the Pacific rim to reassess
America's military role in the region. He was expected to inform
the Philippine and Japanese governments that they can expect a 10
percent to 12 percent cut in U.S. troops based in Asia over the
next three years, and that Congress is unlikely to keep paying as
much for their support as in the past.
   ``Clearly we have a major interest in the Philippines and the
region. It's an important stop,'' Cheney said of the Manila visit.
   The defense secretary pointed out that his discussions come at a
crucial juncture in the U.S.-Philippines relationship with talks
expected to open next month on renewal of the leases for Clark Air
Base, Subic Naval Base and several other military posts.
   ``We've got major negotiations about to begin with the
Philippines on the bases,'' he said, adding that he doesn't intend
``to be in the business of negotiating a new base agreement''
during his stay.
   Instead, he indicated he'd work on improving relations.
   ``I think the things that unite us, that we've got in common,
are a good deal more significant than any momentary stress in the
relationship,'' Cheney said, adding, ``I would expect to focus on
and emphasize those things _ (such as) the historic ties between
our two countries.''
   Cheney said he deliberately ``tried to respond in a very low-key
fashion to Mrs. Aquino's decision not to receive me. ... I think
the president has tried to keep all of that on an even keel as
well.''
   President Bush issued a rare public rebuke to Mrs. Aquino for
refusing to meet with his defense secretary, saying in an interview
that ``she can learn a great deal from Dick Cheney about the way we
view the very important U.S. presence in the Pacific.''
   Cheney said he intended to stress that despite the rumblings
from Congress for troop cuts and sharply reduced Pentagon budgets,
``our interests in the region will continue.''
   He added, ``The message I emphasize is, we're not talking about
a radical departure of U.S. policy. It`s a matter of readjustment,
but it's also a matter of reaffirmation'' of long-term American
ties to the region.
   In recent weeks, U.S. officials have expressed mounting concern
about Aquino's leadership and her ability to withstand the unrest
inside her government that has resulted in a half-dozen coup
attempts.
   Mrs. Aquino's snub of Cheney shocked many because of the support
she'd received from the Bush administration, in particular the
president's decision to authorize U.S. F-4 Phantom Jet Fighters to
pin down rebel planes at the height of the Dec. 1 coup attempt.
   Some analysts have viewed Mrs. Aquino's rejection of Cheney as
an attempt to bolster support inside the Philippines in the face of
charges that Bush's help made her beholden to Washington.
   The two-year leases on the Philippine bases expire in 1991 and
even though Pres. Reagan pledged in 1988 to pay more than $481
million for their use, Congress has refused to cough up the full
amount, a sore point between the two governments.

<HEAD>Study Says Pesticides Can Linger in Homes for Years</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Deletes extraneous words in lead.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says
pesticides may become trapped in homes for years and some say that
could be cause for concern by the public.
   ``These findings call into question some of the fundamental
assumptions we have made about the safety of chemical pesticides,''
Rep. James Scheuer, D-N.Y., after release of a government indoor
air study on Friday.
   Scheuer is a co-sponsor of legislation that would call for
additional research into indoor air quality problems.
   EPA spokesmen characterized the chemical levels found in samples
of air in homes in Florida and Massachusetts as ``uniformly low''
and not great enough to pose a health concern. The report concluded
that ``no risks of major concern were identified.''
   The study by an EPA consultant examined indoor air in 259 homes
in Jacksonville, Fla., and the Springfield-Chicopee area in
Massachusetts to determine the residue levels from 32 selected
pesticides.
   Air monitoring devices were placed inside and outside the homes
over a 24-hour period on three occasions in 1986 though 1988 in a
search for traces of the pesticides. Many of the chemicals have
been commonly used for years in household products such as bug or
flea sprays or for termite control and others normally are used in
agriculture. Some of the chemicals have been banned by the EPA for
a number of years because they are carcinogenic.
   Some of the chemicals were found in the houses at levels much
greater than outdoors, sometimes at levels 50 to 90 times the
levels detected with the outdoor monitors at the same locations,
the study said.
   But the EPA characterized the concentrations as ``very low
levels'' and not surprising because many of the chemicals have been
associated widely with household use.
   ``We characterize the risk as low to negligible,'' said Michael
Firestone, an EPA chemist. ``These are not figures that we didn't
expect to find.''
   But Janet Hathaway, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense
Council who over the years has focused on pesticide issues, said
the study involves an area ``that has tended to be completely
ignored by the EPA.''
   Government regulators have focused on pesticide residue levels
on foods, but have paid little attention to the risks posed by
these chemicals in the air, especially indoors, she said. ``I think
the study is being underplayed by the EPA.''
   Ms. Hathaway said the findings for a number of the chemicals
suggest cancer risks from airborne exposure possibly being greater
than the 1 in 1 million ``minimum risk'' level the government uses
in food residue calculations.
   The study, conducted by Research Triangle Institute in North
Carolina, made no specific risk assessment except to say that
``both cancer and non-cancer risks were evaluated...(and) no risks
of major concern were identified.''
   Some of the highest airborne levels found inside the houses
involved chemicals that over the years have been commonly used to
control termites. Other chemicals have long been associated with
various household products from flea sprays for pets to bathroom
disinfectants and for a variety of garden uses.

<HEAD>Scientists Finish Review of Massive Acid Rain Report</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists from around the globe
have had their chance to review and comment on 15,000 pages of
research from the most comprehensive study of acid rain ever
conducted.
   The challenge now, participants said, is to take the individual
reports and pull them together in an integrated document to provide
planners with a yardstick for gauging the impact of policy
decisions.
   ``Now that we have done the detail, we need to come back to a
universal,'' said James Mahoney, the director of the National Acid
Precipitation Program.
   About 700 scientists from 35 nations on Friday finished a
week-long meeting held to review preliminary reports compiled in a
$500 million study by Mahoney's program.
   ``The sense of development in the science ... has been to
eliminate the two extreme views about acid rain effects,'' Mahoney
said.
   ``There was one extreme that there were no effects that were
really important and nothing is documented _ the other extreme was
that we have an absolute disaster and we're burning up the forests
and the lakes,'' he said.
   Mahoney said the project is the largest study of acid rain ever
conducted. The scientists reviewed 26 draft studies compiled over
ten years.
   Those documents, the work of about 1,000 researchers, focus on
the topics ranging from effects of acid rain on aquatic life to
impacts on forests and building materials.
   Acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and
other pollutants that can fall to earth as rain, snow, sleet, fog
or dust particles.
   The studies indicate the pollution can make lakes and streams
acidic and kill aquatic life. The studies also link acid rain to
declines in certain types of trees and damage to stone buildings
and statues.
   The scientists' comments will be taken into consideration as the
unified report is written.
   Scientists were told there may be no quick answer to some
questions about acid rain.
   The research into forests indicated acid rain may have
contributed to the mortality of red spruce trees in the northern
Appalachians.
   But David Radloff said of the U.S. Forest Service said while
it's possible to gauge impacts on individual trees, larger forest
systems are too complex.
   ``It may be impossible for a long time to prove acid rain is
impacting forest ecosystems,'' he said.

<HEAD>Creditors Reschedule Polish Debt to Aid New Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Showing support for Poland's struggling
non-Communist government, 17 creditor nations agreed to reschedule
nearly a fourth of the country's $40 billion foreign debt and
suspend payments over the next year.
   The agreement Friday, the most generous so far by the Paris Club
group of creditor nations, lets Poland postpone paying principal on
its debt for eight years, said Jean-Claude Trichet, chairman of the
group.
   It allows Poland to reschedule $9.4 billion of its $27 billion
debt to Paris Club nations, including $3.4 billion of arrears.
   That debt, which was due March 1, 1991, is to be spread over 14
years. All payments will now be suspended until March 1, 1991.
   The agreement, reached after two days of negotiations, reflects
Western backing for the government and its radical plans for
adopting a market economy, Trichet said.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki took over in August, ending
four decades of Communist rule in Poland. Since then, hard-line
Communists have been ousted in East Germany, Czechoslovakia,
Bulgaria and Romania.
   Macowiecki sent messages to creditor governments Feb. 9 asking
them to suspend principal and interest payments for 1989 and 1990
on the entire $40 billion Poland owes and to consider freezing the
debt, or even reducing it.
   Mazowiecki said the debt was the greatest threat to Poland's
dramatic attempt to switch from a centrally controlled economy to a
free-market system.
   A deputy government spokesman, Henryk Wozniakowski, said in
Warsaw that the agreement will reduce payments to the West by about
one-fourth.
   Janusz Sawicki, head of the Polish delegation, said Friday's
accord was the best Poland could obtain and should be viewed as a
response to the Mazowiecki's appeal, the Polish news agency PAP
reported.
   The Paris Club agreed with Mazowiecki's suggestion that
consultations also be held on reducing the debt in cooperation with
the International Monetary Fund, the Polish PAP news agency
reported.
   Two weeks ago, the fund approved Poland's economic restructuring
plan, which involves eliminating a huge budget deficit by cutting
subsidies to unprofitable state-run industries and attracting
foreign investment by establishing a convertible currency.
   Elimination of price controls and subsidies created 78 percent
inflation for January alone. The World Bank estimates ending
industrial subsidies will cost 1.7 million jobs _ nearly 10 percent
of Poland's work force _ this year.
   Poland's foreign debt is the largest in Eastern Europe. The
partial payments it was making consumed nearly all its hard
currency earnings, leaving little to rebuild its obsolete industry.
   Most of the debt was accumulated during the 1970s when Edward
Gierek was Communist Party chief. He spent borrowed Western money
on ill-conceived projects and consumer goods in an effort to win
public support.

   A team of U.S. specialists arrived in
northern Vietnam to search for American servicemen missing there
since the Vietnam War, the U.S. Embassy said today.
   Spokesman James Williams said the group of 14 U.S. technical
experts would concentrate in Son La Province to the northwest of
Hanoi and the area around the northern port city of Haiphong.
   They arrived in Hanoi Friday to start the 15-20 day mission in
cooperation with Vietnamese search teams, Williams said.
   The U.S. team comprised a forensic team, a recovery team and two
investigation teams from the Joint Casualty Resolution Center and
the U.S. Army's Central Investigation laboratory, both of which are
in Hawaii, Williams said.
   The forensic teams included anthropologists and experts
specializing in the analysis of dental remains, Williams said.
   In the past, searches have included the excavation of sites
where U.S. warplanes crashed and field expeditions in which
investigators have asked villagers about crashes they witnessed.
   Vietnam last returned the remains of U.S. servicemen in
September 1989. The three sets of remains handed over then are
currently undergoing analysis in Hawaii, Williams said.
   A total of 2,309 U.S. servicemen remain missing in action in
Indochina. Of that number 1,683 are missing from the Vietnam War,
which ended in a 1975 Communist victory over the U.S.-backed South
Vietnamese government.
   Last year, Vietnam agreed to work on ``discrepancy cases''
involving the loss of some 80 Americans. Such cases include people
whom the United States believes were captured, but not freed when
U.S. involvement in the war ended in 1973.
   Vietnam said it now has no U.S prisoners.

<HEAD>Labor Unions Oppose Elections Under Avril</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti's biggest labor unions said
they oppose any elections organized by Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril's
government, which they said is not committed to a transfer of power
to freely elected civilians.
   Virtually all political parties, angered by a crackdown on
government critics in January, also have refused to take part in
presidential elections scheduled for October.
   ``The present state, based as it is on the will and interest of
a small group of men, is unable to hold democratic elections,'' the
country's six largest unions said in a joint statement Friday.
   The unions urged all democrats to set aside their differences
and work for the establishment of ``a state of law.'' They did not
elaborate.
   During the crackdown, more than 50 activists were rounded up,
and many later said they were beaten while in police custody.
   Avril also sent seven prominent opposition leaders into exile.
After protests from the United States, France and the European
Community, he said they could return, but most have refused to come
back.
   Friday's statement was signed by the Autonomous Union of Haitian
Workers, the Confederation of Haitian Workers, the Federation of
Unionized Workers, the Organization of Independent Workers, the
National Confederation of Haitian Teachers, and the Union of
Electric Utility Workers.
   In opposing elections under Avril, opposition leaders have cited
the government's failure to punish soldiers for human rights abuses.
   A Radio Metropole reporter, Ertho Zamor, was severely beaten by
soldiers Wednesday and said a prominent officer, Maj. Isidore
Pongnon, took part in the beating.
   Radio Cacique reporter Willie Paul also was beaten by police
while covering a demonstration last week, and Jean-Andre Destin, a
well known Radio Cacique satirist and critic of Avril, was gunned
down in January.
   In November 1987, Haiti's first free general elections since
independence from France in 1804 were canceled after thugs
protected by soldiers massacred at least 34 voters at polling
stations.
   Avril, a former adviser to ousted dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier,
had promised free elections and an end to human rights abuses when
he replaced Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in a September 1988 coup.
   Namphy had taken power as part of a transitional government
after Duvalier fled to France during a popular uprising in 1986.
Namphy later took over as a military ruler.

   Prince Charles didn't score, but his
team won the first of two polo matches the heir to the British
throne played before a crowd swelled by royalty watchers.
   Nearly 2,000 people came out to see the 40-year-old Prince of
Wales and his Windsor Park teammates defeat Canada's Maple Leaf
squad 11-7 Friday at the Windsor Park Polo Club, 10 miles north of
Vero Beach in the community of Orchid.
   The prince arrived in Vero Beach earlier in the day under the
watchful eyes of British and U.S. security officers. The polo match
was his first public appearance in a weeklong visit to the United
States.
   Wearing a cream-colored uniform with red letters, Prince Charles
failed to add any points to his team's effort but played hard
enough to break the top off his mallet.
   Justin Fletcher, 18, of Vero Beach was working at the match and
got to keep the mallet when the prince had it replaced.
   ``I think I'll frame it,'' Fletcher said.
   In Friday's first match, White Birch _ featuring Gonzalo
Piernes, rated by many as the world's top polo player _ defeated
Ponte Vedra 12-10 to advance.
   The prince's team will play White Birch on Sunday.
   The teams are competing for the Prince of Wales Cup, which the
prince's team won 10-7 last year over Greenwich at the Windsor club.
   Before Sunday's match, the prince is scheduled to appear at a
$250-a-plate lunch and watch a display of wild and endangered
animals, including a baby cheetah and an aardvark.
   He will speak to 550 guests at the luncheon on wildlife
conservation.
   No public appearances were planned for the prince today. He was
expected to remain at the mansion of friends Geoffrey and Jorie
Kent.
   Forty workers reportedly spent months renovating a wing of the
mansion for the prince, who is traveling without his wife Diana or
their children.
   Balconies were added to the prince's room and on the third-story
observation tower, which offers a vista of the Atlantic Ocean and
Indian River.
   The prince's bathroom has a marble tub and several heated towel
racks.
   Round-the-clock security arrangements for Prince Charles are
elaborate, with at least 150 bodyguards, State Department officials
and local police officers.
   During Sunday's polo match, a special ambulance will be ready
exclusively for the prince, said Indian River County chief
paramedic Jim Judge.
   Sections of the coastal Route A1A will be closed to traffic and
pedestrians, said security coordinator Jerry Burr.
   On Monday, Prince Charles is to visit the Kennedy Space Center
before flying to Charleston, S.C., for an international business
conference. Later, he travels to Washington to meet with President
Bush.

   A mild earthquake jostled San
Bernardino County, causing no reports of damage or injuries,
officials said.
   The temblor measured 3.4 on the Richter scale when it hit at
7:46 p.m. Friday, said Hall Daily, spokesman for the California
Institute of Technology, where a seismology lab records quake data.
   The epicenter was located about 6 miles north-northwest of Lake
Arrowhead, Daily said.
   A county sheriff's dispatcher said the jolt prompted no calls
about injuries or damage.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy released during an
earthquake by measuring the ground motion. A quake of magnitude 3.5
can cause slight damage. Every increase of one number on the scale
means that the ground motion is 10 times greater.

   Playing down their differences, a husband
and wife both running for election to Parliament today debated how
to reform Japan's scandal-ridden politics on the last day of
campaigning.
   Confronting each other from separate campaign trucks set along
the boundary of their respective electoral districts in this Tokyo
suburb, Takujiro and Makiko Hamada argued how the country should
revive trust in Japan's flagging political system.
   ``I am fighting from the stance of the Liberal Democrats and
will reform the Liberal Democratic Party from within. Makiko Hamada
is fighting from the stance that reform must take place from
outside the party. But what we are aiming for is the same,'' said
Takujiro Hamada, a three-term lawmaker.
   Japan, controlled for 34 years by the Liberal Democrats, has
been beset by a series of scandals that have shaken faith in the
conservative party. It lost its majority in Parliament's upper
house last year, and voters are expected to vote out several of its
members in elections Sunday for the more powerful lower house.
   Mrs. Hamada, a former flight attendant for Japan Airlines,
emphasized her candidacy as an independent was meant to help
talented politicians such as her husband, who were constrained by
power politics in the governing party.
   ``I believe from my heart that Takujiro Hamada is a very good
politician, a serious politician, a politician who Japan needs. But
is the Liberal Democratic Party really making good the type of
policies Takujiro Hamada is proposing, the great forecasts the
party is making?'' she asked.
   Pausing periodically during her speech to thank her husband for
his support and apologize to irate motorists blocked by the rally
north of Tokyo, Mrs. Hamada said she intended to work toward
creating a second conservative party to revive competition in
Japan's political system.
   ``To realize your ideals'' of bringing better government to the
people, she said, addressing her husband, ``I want to start
building a new conservative party based among the people.''
   Mrs. Hamada, 47, announced her candidacy two months ago over the
wishes of her husband, also 47, and to the surprise of many in this
country where wives have traditionally been expected to follow
their husbands' bidding.
   Her husband has been linked to a scandal in which the
information conglomerate Recruit Co. has been accused of trying to
buy influence with many of Japan's most influential politicians,
bureaucrats and business executives.
   The 13-year political veteran told the small group of supporters
and journalists at the rally that the Liberal Democrats were still
on the right track, although the party needed thorough internal
reform.
   Following the 30-minute rally, the Hamadas shook hands and
hurried off to continue campaigning in their adjoining districts.

<HEAD>Mondale Expresses Cautious Optimism on Prospects for World Peace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Vice President Walter Mondale says
he's cautiously optimistic about the prospects for global peace in
the light of recent political upheavals in Eastern Europe.
   Mondale told a peace forum Friday that, while prospects for
world peace are as good as they've been in his lifetime, he sees
dangers in power struggles in countries such as Romania and
Bulgaria and increasing anti-Semitism reported in the Soviet Union.
   ``I want to be optimistic, but I'm very concerned about these
trends,'' said Mondale, 62, a Minneapolis attorney. ``I'm not sure
we've won the whole thing yet.''
   Mondale is moderator of the two-day Peace Prize Forum at
Augsburg College. The forum, in its second year, is intended to
promote discussion of peace issues and features as speakers Nobel
Peace Prize laureates, diplomats and other leaders.
   The forum continues today.
   Also participating in the forum are former President Carter;
Yelena Bonner, a longtime human rights leader in the Soviet Union
and widow of the late Andrei Sakharov, the prominent Soviet
dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate; and Peter Duffy, chairman
of the international executive committee of Amnesty International.
   Mondale said the Bush administration should be responding more
enthusiastically to the changes in Eastern Europe.
   ``The day (Soviet leader Mikhail S.) Gorbachev announced a
multiparty system, our president was running around asking for more
money for the military,'' Mondale said. ``I think people were
wondering what our president was doing. ... Here's a tremendous
development, and I wish we could get more enthusiastically and
energetically involved. We seem to be more like bookkeepers now,
checking the books.''
   Mondale suggested that President Bush offer Eastern Europe's
fledgling democracies money and know-how, especially about setting
up democratic institutions. He said the money could become
available if military funding were cut to match the shrinking
threat to national security.
   Bonner opened the forum by saying that Gorbachev is a
power-hungry politician who has an overblown reputation as a
reformer.
   ``Gorbachev has shown himself as a very strong leader in the
struggle for his own power and his own survival,'' Bonner said.
``Is he only interested in personal power? Or is he interested in
the rights of the people?''
   Gorbachev's actions have been widely misinterpreted by Western
countries, Bonner said. She said that revolts for democratic change
in the Soviet bloc have been brewing for a long time and Gorbachev
deserves credit only for not stamping them out.
   ``He behaves that way not because he wants them to proclaim
their independence from the Communist Party, but because he could
not stop it,'' Bonner said. ``He had no way of influencing events
in Eastern Europe.''
   The forum is sponsored by five Midwestern colleges of the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. It is held in cooperation
with the Oslobased Norwegian Nobel Institute, which awards the
Nobel Peace Prize.

   About 50 armed men ambushed and
killed a police commander and eight of his men today and then fled
with the slain officers' guns, a local leader said.
   There was no immediate word on the identity of the attackers.
But the military considers the southern village of where the ambush
took place to be a stronghold of Communist guerrillas.
   In other violence, three gunmen shot and killed the chief
security officer of the National Bureau of Investigation inside a
passenger jeep in Manila, investigators said. A woman passenger was
also reported wounded in the attack.
   The identity of those attackers was also unknown, but one
investigator said robbery was possible.
   In the attack at the southern village of Margos, a surviving
policeman wounded some of the assailants, according to Leo
Zaragoza, vice mayor of nearby Kapatagan town, about 500 miles
southeast of Manila.
   Zaragoza, interviewed on radio station DXBB, quoted police
investigators as saying the victims were responding to a report of
a Friday night robbery.
   He said about 50 armed men positioned along the highway fired at
the policemen's jeep as it passed through Margos, killing the nine
men. Among those killed was station commander police Cpl. Artemio
Traiga.
   The military has identified the town as being infiltrated by the
Communist New People's Army.
   The attackers took the slain policemen's M-16 rifles and pistols
and fled carrying some of their own wounded comrades, the vice
mayor said, quoting a village leader.
   Today's violence came as a leftist umbrella group called on the
President Corazon Aquino to order dismantling of U.S. military
bases in the Philippines and enter into new peace negotiations with
the rebels.
   In a statement released to news agencies, outlawed National
Democratic Front renewed a pledge to declare a unilateral
cease-fire if the Aquino government announces it will remove the
U.S. bases by 1991, when the current agreement on the facilities
expires.
   The rebel front's statement came two days before U.S. Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney arrives for a meeting with Defense Secretary
Fidel Ramos. Ramos has said he will discuss with Cheney unfulfilled
U.S. aid commitments to the Philippines and regional security.
   The military has been put on alert for leftist disturbances in
connection with Cheney's two-day visit beginning Monday. Troops in
Central Luzon, where the U.S. bases are located, are reported
bracing for attacks against American servicemen.
   The communists are waging a 21-year-old insurgency against the
national government.
   In the Manila attack, security chief Restituto Masilungan was
shot in the face inside the jeep on a bridge in Manila, homicide
investigator Police Cpl. Rodolfo Janer.
   Janer said the three men may have planned to rob the passengers
but noticed Masilungan's gun and instead ``beat him to the draw.''
   The gunmen fled after the shooting, he said.

<HEAD>Superintendent Files Lawsuit; 180 White Students Leave School
System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's first black school superintendent
has filed a $10 million lawsuit against the white-majority school
board, which sparked racial turmoil when it voted not to renew his
contract.
   Meanwhile, almost 200 students, mostly whites, have decided to
withdraw from the Selma school system, which reopened this week
following a student sit-in to protest the decision not to extend
Norward Roussell's contract beyond June, when it expires.
   Roussell's lawsuit, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in
Mobile, claims his contract was not renewed for racial reasons and
that the board's decision was based, in part, on his ``complete
dismantling'' of a student placement system known as leveling.
   Critics of the system say it was designed to segregate students
and keep blacks in lower-level classes.
   According to the suit, Roussell's decision to end leveling
served as the catalyst for removing him because ``for the first
time in the system's history, black students were given a fair
opportunity to compete in advanced academic classes.''
   About 15 blacks demonstrated at Selma City Hall on Friday to
protest city education policies, chanting ``Do the right thing''
and other slogans intended for white Mayor Joe Smitherman.
   The protesters have been holding rallies and sit-ins at the
building to press their demands that Roussell be rehired for
another three years, that changes be made in student placement
policies, and that the city go to an elected, rather than
appointed, school board.
   The 11-member school board, which has six white members, voted
along racial lines in December not to renew Roussell's three-year
contract.
   Roussell said nearly 12 percent of the white students in Selma's
6,000-student public school system have withdrawn since the schools
reopened on Tuesday under heavy security.
   ``I'm sure they've left because of the tense situation we're
facing,'' Roussell said, ``but I think that when we get out of this
situation and resolve our problems, people will begin to come
back.''
   Since Tuesday, 199 students have left the system, 180 of them
white, Roussell said. That leaves about 1,500 whites in a system
that is 70 percent black.
   Smitherman, who was in office during the racial turmoil of the
1960s, said the withdrawal figures were ``very saddening.'' He said
continued withdrawals could turn into ``chaotic situations in
surrounding counties.''

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party chief in Samarkand today
denied a report by state-run Radio Moscow that rioting in Soviet
Central Asia had spread to his ancient city in Uzbekistan.
   The broadcast said members of the Moslem majority fought ethnic
Armenians.
   The report aired on Radio Moscow's international
English-language service late Friday followed a week of unrest in
the neighboring Soviet republic of Tadzhikistan, where 20 people
were killed and 568 wounded by Interior Ministry count.
   Nasyr Yakubov, the first party secretary of Samarkand, told The
Associated Press by telephone his city was quiet, there were no
riots and no curfew was imposed.
   He said the city's 12,000 Armenian residents live in peace with
members of other ethnic groups.
   Asatyulo Yusupov, a duty officer at the Interior Ministry office
in Samarkand, also denied the radio report.
   Radio Moscow reported Friday that the Interior Ministry sent
troop reinforcements to Samarkand and ordered residents to remain
in their homes after dark. Despite those measures, the radio said,
rallies and demonstrations continued.
   It cited the Interfax news service, a joint venture affiliated
with Radio Moscow, as the source of its information.
   No other state Soviet news outlet carried the report, which did
not mention casualties or damage in Samarkand, a city of colorfully
tiled buildings, domed mosques and oriental bazaars.
   The ancient city is about 1,700 miles southeast of Moscow and
has a population of 390,000, mostly Moslems. The Armenian refugees
are mainly Christians.
   Asked about Yakubov's and Yusopov's denials, an editor at Radio
Moscow's central newsroom in the Soviet capital acknowledged today
the radio had not been able to independently confirm the details of
the Interfax report.
   The report was sent via facsimile to subscribing Western news
organizations in Moscow. Interfax, created last year, has been a
usually reliable source on developments in the Soviet Union and
even broke the news of what would be in Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
speech on political reforms to the Communist Party leadership
earlier this month.
   Tass, the official news agency, reported Friday that inflamatory
leaflets were being circulated in areas of Uzbekistan bordering
Tadzhikistan. They demanded ``the immediate eviction of Russians
from Central Asia'' and denounced the alleged resettlement in
Uzbekistan of refugees, presumably Armenians, who fled Azerbaijan,
Tass said.
   Tass said a man identified as Kh. Saidov was arrested in
Samarkand for carrying 30 anti-Armenian leaflets, and the Siab
district court fined another man, I. Guseinov, 500 rubles ($830)
for advocating the eviction of Armenians and using force against
them.
   Tadzhikistan, 1,600 miles southeast of Moscow, was the latest in
a string of republics torn by ethnic strife since Mikhail S.
Gorbachev came to power five years ago and relaxed central
controls. He has repeatedly warned that the turmoil threatens his
reform program.
   The strife in Tadzhik capital, Dushanbe, was touched off Feb. 10
by rumors that Armenian refugees were arriving by the thousands and
receiving scarce apartments.
   Interfax said authorities brought Dushanbe under control Friday,
halting a week of bloodshed. Izvestia, the government daily, said
the central part of Dushanbe, a city of 600,000 people, was being
guarded by special Soviet army commando units.
   Tadzhikistan's top three officials, including Communist Party
chief Kakhar M. Makhkamov, offered to step down Wednesday because
of the rioting. But the resignations were rejected Friday at an
emergency session of the policy-making Central Committee of the
republic's Communist Party.
   The committee decided that ``while there is such a difficult
situation in the republic, its leaders do not have the right to
resign,'' Mansur Sultanov of the Gostelradio state broadcasting
authority said from Dushanbe.
   Sultanov said he had not heard the rumors of an impending
massacre cited by Interfax. But he said an unauthorized
demonstration was scheduled today. At previous demonstrations, held
in defiance of government orders, Tadzhiks demanded the ouster of
their party and government leaders.
   Ethnic Russians, who make up 10 percent of Tadzhikistan's
population of 5 million, are worried about the unrest but so far
are not leaving, Sultanov said.
   The scarcity of housing in Uzbekistan, which like Tadzhikistan
has one of the Soviet Union's highest birth rates, seemed to be
fueling nationalist sentiments there.
   The Presidium of the Tadzhikistan Supreme Soviet formed a
special commission to investigate how people died in the week of
violence, said Boris K. Pugo, a non-voting member of the ruling
Politburo visiting Dushanbe.

   When detectives arrested a man for the 1946
killing of a Miami police officer, they said he was expecting them,
that he knew it was only a matter of time before they would arrive.
   But the arrest of 61-year-old Leroy Strachan on Thursday in
lower Manhattan left the arresting officers from Miami with mixed
emotions _ proud at solving an old case but bothered that the
suspect apparently led a life untarnished by crime in New York.
   In the years since the slaying, Strachan got married, had three
children _ one of them is a state corrections officer _ and worked
for 21 years as a freight elevator operator.
   Miami Detective George Cadavid said the arrest was ``a great ego
booster, no doubt. Not only was a human life taken but another
police officer's life was taken. But here's a person who is now 61
years old and was 17 years old when the incident happened, and as
far as we can tell, he's never been arrested.''
   Strachan was arrested thanks to an anonymous tip eight months
ago from a conscience-stricken witness, authorities said.
   Police said Strachan admitted to Miami detectives in late
January that he had shot the officer. The victim, Officer John
Milledge, was one of Miami's first black police officers.
   He told detectives he had been waiting to be arrested since they
had talked to him in late January, the detectives said.
   ``He knew us,'' Cadavid said. ``He said, `Are you going to
arrest me?''' and asked to call his attorney in Miami.
   ``He has admitted shooting the policeman and there is other
evidence,'' Cadavid said. Strachan did not express any remorse over
the shooting, the detective said.
   The suspect had several thousand dollars on him at the time of
his arrest, leading police to think that he was about to leave the
city.
   Strachan, still wearing his dark brown work uniform, looked
nervous as he refused to waive extradition during a brief
arraignment at Manhattan Criminal Court on Friday.
   Strachan's lawyer, Alan Mass, told Judge Bruce Allen the fact
that Florida allowed capital punishment played a part in Strachan's
decision.
   ``No way if it's within our power that Mr. Strachan is going
back to Florida,'' Mass told reporters outside court.
   The judge ordered Strachan held without bail pending a March 14
hearing.
   Milledge was fatally shot Nov. 1, 1946, while on patrol outside
a football game in the Overtown section of Miami, after he had
chased and beaten several teens who tried to sneak into the game,
Cadavid said.
   The Milledge case was reopened by the department's ``cold case
squad'' after an anonymous July 1989 tip to Crime Stoppers from a
woman who had seen a youth with a .22-caliber rifle running from
the shooting scene.
   ``The reason she never came forward was because her husband was
very good friends with the shooter,'' Cadavid said. The woman's
husband died a few years ago ``and her conscience was bothering
her,'' he said.
   Cadavid called a New York City detective, who ran a check and
located Strachan.
   In late January, the Miami detectives talked with Strachan in
New York.
   ``He told us what had happened, we went back to Miami to do some
more investigation, to corroborate some of his story, we found
witnesses. We found one witness that he had confessed to that same
night,'' Cadavid said.
   Strachan said that the night of the slaying, Milledge had hit
several youths.
   According to police, Strachan said he got a rifle from a friend,
told everyone to step aside, fired one shot at Milledge, then ran.
   The next day he left for New York.

<HEAD>Fruit Juice Pulled From Shelves in Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JACOBS, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen brands of fruit juice made
at a local plant and shipped throughout much of Canada were being
recalled after a chemical that causes cancer in laboratory animals
was found in samples.
   Sundor Canada Inc., which is owned by Cincinnati-based Procter &amp;
Gamble Co., announced Friday it is recalling all its 48-ounce cans
of juice made from concentrate. The juice is shipped primarily to
Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada.
   Health and Welfare Canada said the contaminated juices do not
present a major health threat but the company had been asked to
recall the products as a precaution.
   The company said juice not made from concentrate is not being
recalled because it is processed without adding local water. The
water has been found to be contaminated with the chemical N-nitroso
dimethylamine, or DMNA.
   Also excluded from the recall are products in glass or plastic
bottles and drinking boxes.
   The following brands are affected: Martins, Bright's, A and P,
Dominion, IGA, Food City, Cavalier, Timothy's, Calbecks's, Pantry
Shelf, Red Label, Sunshine, and Libby's Pineapple Juice.
   Tests taken from October to December found DMNA at levels
reaching five parts per billion. The government's guideline for
DMNA in drinking water is 0.014 parts per billion.
   DMNA is a waste byproduct in the manufacture of some
agricultural and rubber products. It has been found in emissions
from a Uniroyal Chemical plant in nearby Elmira.
   The province ordered the chemical plant shut down earlier this
month after the DMNA turned up in nearby wells.
   Sundor Canada Inc., formerly known as Martins Foods Company, is
owned by the Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
   In a statement released Friday night, the company said: ``It is
difficult to predict what level of DMNA would be potentially
harmful'' given the varying amounts of juice that people drink.
   ``However, Sundor believes it is a prudent course of action to
recall all these products until it has a better analysis of the
risk involved.''
   Barry Pipes, a company spokesman, said the recall involves
``thousands of cases'' of juice. Each case contains 12 48-ounce
cans. The company did not specify what types of juice were affected.
   Pipes said the tests were performed because the company was
concerned about local water quality.
   Earlier this week, about 160 million bottles of Perrier in 120
countries were being removed from shelves after the cancer-causing
chemical benzene was found in some of the water.
   Perrier officials said some shipments of the bottled water were
contaminated by a dirty filter at the company's underground spring
in Vergeze, France. The filter is designed to remove naturally
occurring benzene from the carbon dioxide gas that gives Perrier
its distinctive bubble.

   Showers soaked Los Angeles, southern Texas, the Gulf and parts
of Florida. Winds from the northwest cooled the Eastern states,
although afternoon highs were likely to remain 10 degrees or more
above normal from the eastern Carolinas to Florida.
   Parts of Utah and Wyoming braced for Pacific moisture and gusts
up to 50 mph.
   Snow closed nearly 80 miles of Interstate 80 in northern
California on Friday, dumping up to 3 feet of fresh snow on the
mountains, with 2 feet recorded at Placerville and 18 inches in
Auburn.
   Snow continued across the southern Great Lakes, on the
Washington coast and in Northern Plains.
   Arctic air, flurries and sub-zero temperatures were expected by

buffeted Syracuse, N.Y., today.
   Thousands of customers were without power Friday in the Midwest
and Northeast after snow and ice storms.
   Thunderstorms spawned tornadoes and heavy rain in the Southeast
on Friday, triggering widespread flooding.
   Rising waters forced hundreds to evacuate in parts of Georgia,
Tennessee, North Carolina, and Alabama.
   Tornadoes touched down at Carrollton, Ga., Irmo, S.C., and
Chilton County, Ala.
   Wind gusted to 63 mph during a thunderstorm at Robins Air Force
Base, Ga.
   Advisories for strong winds and wind chills near 60 below were
posted for Montana's northwest passes. A winter storm watch was
posted for the northwest valleys and for the mountains of northern
Utah through tonight.
   Blinding snow postponed the sled dog races scheduled for the

   Donald Trump is considering reconciling with his
wife, Ivana, because of the effects a divorce would have on the
couple's three children, a published report said.
   The Daily News today quoted an unnamed source close to the
billionaire developer who said Trump is thinking of ``dropping the
whole thing'' for the children's welfare.
   The annonymous source told the News the immense publicity the
planned divorce has generated has enabled Trump to ``test the
waters of public opinion, and the results seem quite clear.''
   The Trumps' children are Donald Jr., 12, Ivancka, 8, and Eric, 6.
   Word of the divorce was reported last Sunday and news about the
couple's break-up has been splashed across the front of New York's
three tabloids, including reports on purported Trump girlfriend
Marla Maples.
   Trump's fortune is an estimated $1.7 billion. His major assets
are the Trump Tower in New York, the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino
in Atlantic City, N.J, and the Trump Shuttle.
   The couple has a divorce agreement which was updated four times
during their nearly 13-year marriage. It reportedly would give
Ivana $25 million, a Connecticut estate and custody of their three
children.

<HEAD>Four Former Palace Guards Executed For Roles in Failed 1965 Coup</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: One name correct for Suharto, Sukarno, Solaeman</NOTE>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four members of former President
Sukarno's palace guard have been executed after serving nearly a
quarter century on death row for their involvement in a failed
coup, a government spokesman said today.
   In Washington, the human rights group Asia Watch today asked
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to condemn
the executions by firing squad, which it called ``an act of
cowardice.''
   Brig. Gen. Nurhadi Purwosaputro, an armed forces spokesman,
confirmed that Solaeman, Noor Tohayana, Satar Suryanto and Yohannes
Surono had been put to death Tuesday.
   All were arrested shortly after the abortive Communist coup on
Sept. 30, 1965. They were charged with kidnapping and killing Gen.
Achmad Yani, the army commander. They were convicted by a military
tribunal.
   Officials gave no reason why the four remained on death row for
24 years, but delays in carrying out earlier executions were said
to have been made to allow time for the accused to divulge
information about their activities.
   The government executed nine former members of the banned
Indonesian Communist Party in September 1986. The party was accused
of planning the coup.
   In addition to Yani, five other army generals were killed in the
coup bid, which was crushed within 48 hours by troops led by then
Maj. Gen. Suharto. He is now president.
   In the bloodbath that followed the coup, an estimated 450,000 to
500,000 people were killed by anti-Communist forces.
   More than 500,000 also were detained following the uprising,
among them some of the nation's best-known writers, poets,
educators, journalists and intellectuals.
   Sukarno relinquished power to Suharto when calm was restored in
March, 1966.
   Asia Watch sent messages to Bush, Gorbachev and other heads of
state declaring that ``to spend a quarter century waiting to be
killed is cruel and inhuman punishment by any standard.''
   It also said the four guardsmen were sentenced by military
courts after trials ``lacking any semblance of fairness.''

   Hazardous wastes have contaminated Chinese food,
water and air far beyond international safety standards, causing
``significant damage'' to the health of millions of people, an
international conference said today.
   The conference, organized by the Chinese government and the U.N.
Development Program, also warned that water resources are fast
being depleted.
   During the first three decade of Communist rule, pollution was
considered a problem confined to capitalist countries. In recent
years, China has passed an environmental protection law and laws on
controlling water and air pollution, but it has lacked the money
and personnel to reverse the steady deterioration of the
environment.
   The 44 Chinese and 14 foreign experts at the five-day conference
ending today called for ``urgent action'' to strengthen regulations
and penalties, improve factory efficiency, and take steps to better
manage the environment.
   Deng Nan, director-general of the Social Development Department
and daughter of senior leader Deng Xiaoping, said ``significant
damage is now occurring to the health of both urban and rural
residents mainly due to economic constraints and rapid economic
development.''
   She said industrial wastes are destroying water resources and
that the burning last year of 1 billion tons of coal _ about a ton
per person _ has exacerbated respiratory diseases.
   The workshop said many factories, particularly small rural
enterprises, lack any pollution control equipment and emit wastes
and air pollutants directly into the environment.
   Poorly maintained equipment causes leaks, there is often little
incentive to run factories efficiently, and managers lack
information about how to protect the environment, it said.
   Ms. Deng said China must charge more for water and coal to
encourage recycling and efficient use, invest in sewers and sewage
treatment plants, and improve the quality of its coal so its
combustion produces less ash, smoke and sulphur dioxide.
   The workshop also recommended that China put more effort into
industrial planning, training of environmental experts, water
conservation and enforcement of water pollution policies.
   Qu Geping, head of the National Environmental Protection Agency,
said China now spends about $2 billion a year on the environment.
That amount is 0.7 percent of its gross national product.
   He said his agency hopes to increase that amount to 1 percent of
the gross national product by 1992, which would be one of the
highest rates in the developing world. But he acknowledged that
``just to control today's level of pollution, it shouldn't be lower
than 1.5 percent of GNP.''
   The gross national product is a measures of the total worth of
goods and services produced.
   Qu said a study made five years ago estimated pollution causes
$12.8 billion in damage to the economy and the health of the nation
every year.

   A day-care center owner accused of
possessing child pornography tested negative for a veneral disease
found in three children who attended his preschool, the police said.
   The attorney for John W. Shaver, who currently is free on
$75,000 bond, said test results released Fiday indicate that either
the children were infected by someone else or test results from the
children were incorrect.
   ``I think the state should go back to the drawing board if they
have three children who are testing positive for gonorrhea because,
to me, it means that there may be someone else out there they
should be looking for,'' said lawyer J. David Bogenschutz.
   Police spokesman Ott Cefkin said police are confident the test
results are accurate.
   ``The Health Department told us they were absolutely positive in
their findings,'' Cefkin said.
   Shaver, 56, faces charges of possessing child pornography and
using pictures of children to create pornographic images. On
Tuesday, police added 24 counts of procuring the sexual performance
of a child.
   A venereal test given to Shaver as part of the conditions for
his release from jail showed he did not have the sexually
transmitted disease, police said.
   Shaver was tested after health officials discovered gonorrhea in
throat cultures of three children who attended Shaver's Rainbow
Learning Center.
   The new charges involve allegedly pornographic photo montages
found in Shaver's home that combine pictures of children with nude
pictures from magazines.
   Bogenschutz has entered an innocent plea on behalf of his client.
   About 200 children have attended Shaver's preschool since its
opening in 1985. County officials closed it down this month as the
police investigation widened.

<HEAD>Voters Cast Ballots in Election for Moslem Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in Moslem-dominated southern
provinces went to the polls today to elect their first autonomous
Moslem government, despite a wave of bombings, political brawls and
ballot theft.
   The elections are being held under a plan by President Corazon
Aquino to meet popular demand and blunt a Moslem insurgency in the
region by allowing more local rule.
   Four candidates were running for regional governor, seven for
vice governor, and 137 for 21 assembly seats in four
Moslem-dominated provinces in the south, according to Commission on
Election records.
   The four provinces _ Lanao Del Sur, Maguindanao, Tawi-tawi and
Sulu _ voted to join the regional government in a referendum
covering 13 southern provinces and cities in November.
   A bomb exploded on the eve of the polls, and another blast
occurred an hour before polling stations opened today at 7 a.m. in
the town of Jolo, 600 miles south of Manila, said Maj. Hermogenes
Esperon, a spokesman for the military's Southern Command. An
exploded grenade was also found, he said.
   No one was reported injured, and no one has claimed
responsibility for the bombings.
   ``We hope that with the assurance of the armed forces ... this
election will be a clean and credible one,'' said Commission on
Elections Executive Director Vicente Delima. He was interviewed by
a local radio station from Cotabato city, 530 miles southeast of
Manila.
   Esperon said unidentified armed men snatched five ballot boxes
in the town of Buldon in Maguindanao province.
   He gave no details, but local radio reports from the area said
the men were followers of one of the candidates and pursuing
soldiers killed as many as three of them.
   Meanwhile, 12 men were hurt in a brawl among followers of
opposing candidates in the town of Marantao in nearby Lanao Del Sur
province. No arrests were reported.
   Local radio reports also said armed men seized ballot boxes, and
firefights occurred in the Maguindanao towns of Matanago, Buluan
and Barira. Balloting was canceled in the village of Gata.
   Critics have questioned the viability of the autonomous region,
saying that the four provinces are among the poorest in the
country, lack adequate communications and transportation, and are
not even contiguous.
   The regional government will control its own police force and
take responsibility for taxation, natural resources, economic
development and education.
   Responsibility for foreign affairs, defense and customs remains
with Mrs. Aquino's government.
   The Moro National Liberation Front, a Moslem guerrilla group,
has opposed the plan as inadequate and vowed to continue its nearly
20-year rebellion to secede.

   Imelda Marcos' new attorney, trying to repair
the image of the former Philippine first lady, asks that people
compare her to Nancy Reagan.
   ``Suppose Mrs. Reagan were abducted from her home in California
and taken to the Philippines and charged in the Philippines with
crimes she allegedly committed in the U.S.,'' the attorney, Gerry
Spence, said Friday. ``How do you think Mrs. Reagan would feel?''
   Spence made his remarks after a federal court hearing on the
racketeering indictment that charged Mrs. Marcos and her late
husband, Ferdinand Marcos, with embezzling more than $100 million
from the Philippine treasury to buy art and Manhattan real estate.
They also were charged with defrauding banks of $165 million in
loans.
   Marcos died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28 at age 72.
   Spence of Jackson Hole, Wyo., who had represented the family of
Karen Silkwood, was hired by Mrs. Marcos as part of changes in her
defense team that included the dropping of two other attorneys.
   Mrs. Marcos' trial had been scheduled to start March 13 but at
the hearing, U.S. District Judge John Keenan delayed it a week,
until March 20, to give Spence more time to prepare his case.
   In his statement to reporters, Spence said, ``I hope you take
the opportunity to view this case from the perspective of a woman
instead of a queen because women have rights whether they're a
queen or not.''
   He claimed the case was a political prosecution.
   Spence, who has written several books including ``And Justice
for None,'' gained prominence when he tackled chemical giant
Kerr-McGee in 1979 to win a $10.5 million jury award for the heirs
of Karen Silkwood. A federal appeals court reversed the award and
the family later settled for a smaller amount.
   Silkwood, who worked at a Kerr-McGee plutonium plant in
Oklahoma, was killed in a car crash in 1974 on her way to meet a
reporter to talk about alleged workers' exposure to plutonium.
   The two attorneys leaving Mrs. Marcos' legal team are Richard A.
Hibey of Washington, her former lead counsel, and Sandor Frankel of
New York.
   Spence would not comment on why the two were leaving, but Hibey
had been named in a possible conflict of interest raised by
prosecutors, who said they intended to call one of his law partners
as a witness. Spence said Mrs. Marcos had become distressed when he
discussed the possible conflict with her.

   People emerged from their bunkers today
and showered rice on troops loyal to Gen. Michel Aoun as the
soldiers rumbled through two devastated neighborhoods captured from
a rival Christian militia.
   ``Long live the army! Long live Aoun!'' weary residents shouted
from balconies strung with Lebanese flags.
   ``We lived 17 days underground. It's so good to breathe fresh
air again!'' a woman shouted as she and others sunned themselves on
a pockmarked balcony overlooking a burned armored personnel carrier.
   For many, however, there was little to celebrate after 18 days
of fighting for mastery of Lebanon's 310-square-mile Christian
enclave. The battle has killed 615 people and wounded 1,829.
   ``My poor children. What has happened to your father?'' a mother
sobbed in Ein Rummaneh as she hugged her two kids. Her husband was
a militiaman for Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces, pushed out of the
residential district on Friday after a savage, two-day attack.
   Aoun's command, in a communique, said the Lebanese Forces
mounted an attack at dawn today against the helicopter base at Adma
in the Christian heartland of Kesrouan province.
   The short communique, broadcast by Aoun's Radio Lebanon, said
the 500 commandos in charge of defending the base were
``confronting the gunmen.'' It did not elaborate.
   The base is the only military facility that remains loyal to
Aoun in Kesrouan province, the power base for Geagea's militia.
   Aoun's radio said the attack started ``behind a fierce artillery
and rocket barrage.'' It did not disclose further details.
   Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 12 of
Lebanon's 18 French-made helicopter gunships are at the Adma base.
   Today's attack came a few hours after 900 soldiers from Aoun's
19,000-member army, advancing behind 36 U.S.-made M-48 tanks,
dislodged Geagea's militia from Ein Rummaneh on Beirut's
southeastern edge in a savage, two-day attack that wrecked the
residential district.
   At least 75 people were killed and 54 wounded in the assault on
Ein Rummaneh, police said.
   A carpet of glass shards and debris covered the narrow alleys of
Ein Rummaneh. Smoke continued to billow today from hundreds of
gutted apartment buildings.
   Pieces of furniture blown out of shelled apartments were
scattered in the streets. Water from blasted rooftop tanks drained
into underground shelters.
   ``The people of Lebanon are subjected to the ugliest wave of
annihilation in their history at the hands of Gen. Aoun ....
Silence is a crime. All available means must be used to save
Lebanon,'' Geagea said in his appeal, which was repeatedly
broadcast by the Christian Voice of Lebanon radio.
   His reference to the ``legitimate authority'' was a call on
Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi to intervene to dislodge the
rebellious general from his command headquarters at the
shell-wrecked presidential palace, which he has refused to
relinquish.
   Geagea's mention of ``available means'' appeared to be a signal
that the chieftain of the 6,000-member Christian militia would not
object to an intervention by the 40,000 Syrian troops deployed in
Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   The leftist Beirut newspaper As-Safir, which is close to Hrawi,
reported ``movements'' by Hrawi's troops and Syrian soldiers in
Moslem west Beirut and the southeastern mountains overlooking the
Christian enclave overnight. There were no details.
   Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic like Aoun and Geagea, was elected
Nov. 24 under a peace plan brokered by the Arab League. The plan
was designed to end the country's nearly 15-year-old civil war and
provide more power to the nation's Moslems.
   Aoun, who was serving as head of an interim Cabinet, rejected
the peace pact and the government of Hrawi. Aoun, who refused
Hrawi's order to quit as army commander, has criticized the peace
plan for not laying out a timetable for a complete withdrawal of
Syrian forces.
   Geagea has recognized Hrawi, but he has been vague on the peace
agreement.

   A top-ranking adviser to Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today ``there won't be any unification''
if the West insists on NATO membership for the combined German
states.
   The issues of NATO membership and the German military stance
have become increasingly important as plans for German unity
advance.
   ``If the Western alliance sticks with its demand for a NATO
membership of all of Germany, then there won't be any German
unification,'' said Valentin Falin in an interview with Saarland
state radio.
   Falin, in addition to serving as a Gorbachev adviser, is the
head of the international section of the Soviet Communist Party's
Central Committee. He is a former Soviet ambassador to West Germany.
   Falin called on Western nations to use the opportunity of German
unity to ensure peace in Europe. ``We are talking about doing away
with the military factor in Europe overall,'' he said.
   West German officials, pushing ahead with plans for German
unification, have proposed a 16-state united Germany with NATO
membership but left open the possibility that Soviet troops might
remain in the eastern sector.
   ``Defense obligations are indivisible and cannot be weakened for
a whole Germany,'' Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg of West
Germany said Friday, adding that military integration will be an
initial step.
   Stoltenberg said defense officials of East and West Germany will
meet after the East German elections March 18 to work out a joint
security policy and that the continued presence of Soviet troops in
what is now East Germany was open to discussion.
   He raised the possibility of a ``transitional phase'' in which
the West German and East German armies would cooperate while
retaining their own command structures, but also said: ``We are not
going to have two different armed forces in a united Germany for
long.''
   The Soviet Union has been insisting that a united Germany be
neutral, while Western allies want it to remain in NATO.
   The push for quick unification is worrying some countries that
suffered occupation by Nazi Germany, such as Poland.
   Poland has asked to be included in talks on German unification
between the two German states and the four World War II allies _
the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France.
   On Friday, East German Premier Hans Modrow endorsed the Polish
request during a visit to Warsaw.
   West Germany's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who has
rejected the Polish request, said Friday that immediately after
East German elections next month, the two governments must declare
that they will have no territorial claims against their European
neighbors after reunification.
   ``This applies especially for Poland,'' Genscher said. He said
German unity will enhance European stability.
   An international Holocaust awareness organization said victims
of the last united Germany, which produced Hitler and the Nazis,
have ``great fears'' of the rush toward reunification.
   Letters to Kohl and Modrow from the Simon Wiesenthal Center in
Los Angeles said the fears stem in part from the fact that the
Germans have not consulted thos victims about reunificiation.
   ``Not a single word is said publicly about the great internal
questions of how to educate millions of people who have lived under
an oppressive regime and have been cut off from the real world for
more than 40 years, and how to prevent their ignorance of the past
from negatively affecting the course of the future,'' said Rabbi
Marvin Hier in a letter dated Feb. 9 and released Friday.
   Hier proposed education programs, oversight committees, strong
ties to Israel and establishment of Holocaust memorials and Jewish
cultural exchange programs.

   The government today put three main
opposition leaders under house arrest on the eve of their planned
launch of a pro-democracy movement in the Himalayan kingdom.
   The arrests follow the detention of the leader of the United
Left Front and hundreds of other activists who demand an end to
Nepal's 29-year-old ban on political parties.
   Police surrounded the home of Ganesh Man Singh, a senior leader
of newly formed Nepali Congress Party, and placed him under house
arrest, family sources said. Armed police guarded the entrance and
did not allow anyone to enter.
   Government sources confirmed that arrest, and said authorities
also put under house arrest Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, the acting
president of the leftist party, and G.P. Koirala, the party's
secretary-general.
   The sources described the action as ``preventative detention.''
   The party planned to formally launch a popular opposition
movement Sunday demanding a multiparty system. It is supported by
the United Left, a coalition of the seven factions of the outlawed
Communist Party. Sunday is Nepal's 40th National Democracy Day.
   On Tuesday, police arrested senior United Left officials,
including its leader, Sahana Pradhan.
   Bhattarai on Friday said that more than 2,200 activists,
including a large number of students, had been rounded up by the
police in a nationwide crackdown on dissent.
   But the Home Ministry later that day issued a statement saying
only 559 persons suspected of involvement in disruptive activities
in the movement had been taken into custody. It said further
investigations were under way.
   Bhattarai had said the Nepali Congress would carry out its
platform even if its three top leaders were arrested.
   He said the movement would be peaceful and non-violent, and
added ``if anything happens, the entire responsibility lies with
the government.''
   Although the party is outlawed, it runs an office in a downtown
building.
   The government, a constitutional monarchy, contends that the
party is trying to force its own version of democracy.
   On Friday, the International Press Institute said King
Birendra's government seized editions of two weekly newspapers that
gave extensive coverage to the campaign for multiparty democracy.
   The institute, which has offices in London and Zurich, said the
editions were seized Tuesday. It issued a protest to Home Minister
Niranjan Thapa, calling for an end to ``harassment, fear and
intimidation.''
   King Birendra, who is seen as a reincarnation of the Hindu god
Vishnu, has ruled for 17 years. It is against the law to criticize
him.

   The foreign ministers of 18 European
and Asian countries today praised recent reforms in South Africa
but said international pressure should be maintained until Pretoria
begins dismantling apartheid.
   The declaration came at the end of a two-day annual conference
of the European Economic Community and the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations.
   The ministers met after President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa
lifted a ban on Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and
other groups on Feb. 2, then released the black nationalist leader
on Sunday after 27 years in prison.
   On Friday, the exiled leadership of the ANC said it would send a
delegation to South Africa to meet with de Klerk to discuss opening
talks on ending the group's three-decade guerrilla war against
apartheid.
   De Klerk wants to negotiate a new constitution that will include
the 28 million black majority in the national government. But he
opposes a one-man, one-vote system and outright black majority
rule, the basic demand of all leading anti-apartheid groups,
including the ANC. He envisions some mechanism that will give
whites veto power on major policy decisions.
   ``While welcoming the recent lifting of the ban on the ANC and
other organizations and the release of Mr. Nelson Mendela, they
were of the view that more needed to be done in order to establish
a climate conducive to a meaningful dialogue,'' the ministers'
declaration said.
   It added the ministers' ``common objective was the complete and
peaceful eradication of the apartheid system and that, pending
evidence of clear and irreversible change to this end, appropriate
pressure should be maintained on the South African government.''
   A senior official at the talks, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said some countries at the meeting even want more
pressure put on South Africa to end its system of racial
discrimination.
   The 12 EEC members are Britain, Spain, the Netherlands, France,
Italy, Portugal, Luxembourgh, West Germany, Denmark, Belgium,
Ireland and Greece.
   The six ASEAN countries are the Philippines, Indonesia,
Thailand, Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore.

   The Vatican's delegate to the Catholic
Church in Mexico will also become the pope's envoy to the Mexican
president, the Vatican said today, prompting speculation that
formal diplomatic relations will be restored.
   Overwhelmingly Catholic Mexico has had no formal ties with the
Vatican since 1926, when Mexico expelled the papal envoy during a
crackdown on Catholic dissidents.
   ``A significant step,'' read the title of a Vatican
announcement. The Vatican said Pope John Paul II and Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari established permanent envoys to
allow ``a permanent dialogue about common interest and for
contributing to a useful cooperation.''
   The pope plans to make his second visit to Mexico in May.
   On Wednesday, Mexico's interior secretary announced that the
president would soon appoint a personal representative.
   The announcement caused outcries by opposition groups, which
accused the government of violating Mexico's constitutional
separation of church and state.
   The issue is a sensitive one in Mexico, where the church was
historically linked with landowners and other power groups which
resisted social change. Mexican law prohibits clergy from teaching
in universities and schools and even bans priests from voting or
wearing their collar in public.

   The soldiers who helped overthrow the
Ceausescu regime won another victory today when the provisional
government appointed a new defense minister of their choosing to
replace the one they forced out.
   Victor Anastase Stanculescu, a lieutenant general who was the
economic minister, was named to replace Defense Minister Nicolae
Militaru.
   The appointment climaxed a week-long protest by junior and
middle-level officers who demanded the dismissal of 74-year-old
Militaru because they said he had not carried out the democratic
reforms called for in the December revolution that toppled
hard-line Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   On Thursday night, state-run television broadcast a frank but
edited tape of talks between Deputy Prime Minister Gelu Voican
Voiculescu and 58 officers from 38 units who presented a list of 13
demands including Militaru's ouster.
   At one point, Voiculescu asked the officers who they would
wanted as defense chief and they said Stanculescu.
   At Stanculescu's installation ceremony today, interim President
Ion Iliescu said the new minister ``has prestige in the army and is
appreciated by its command.'' Militaru, Iliescu said, ``did not
succeed in establishing a real communication with the army's
command, aggravating the situation in the army to a point at which
it became a source of tension for all of society.''
   Iliescu said Romania still faces ``a grave situation of the
political, social and economic spheres.''
   He did not say who would head the economic ministry.
   The appointment of a new defense minister defused the first
challenge by the military to the government it helped create in
December's revolution.
   At its first meeting Friday, the 21-member Executive Bureau of
the ruling Council of National Unity endorsed the creation of a
commission to investigate all the officers' demands and expressed
hope that the measures taken by the government would calm the
situation in the country. Iliescu heads the bureau.
   Thousands of civilians had flocked to Victory Square in
Bucharest to support the officers, whose decision to back the
popular uprising in December was crucial to winning the revolution.
Similar demonstrations were held in Timisoara and the port of
Constanta.
   The newspaper Tineretul Liber reported today that a big
demonstration backing the officers was also held in Brasov,
Romania's second-largest city, on Friday. Protesters shouted, ``The
army is with us, and we are with the army.'' The newspaper Adevarul
said today that before Iliescu's announcement, the national news
agency Rompres had received a statement from a committee of the
Military Central Command backing the officers' call for Militaru's
resignation.
   The committee called for the ministry to be run by generals and
officers ``not compromised during the revolution.'' It also
demanded the retirement of all officers, like Militaru, who were
recalled to active duty during the revolution.
   Navy officers from Tulcea in the Danube delta also backed the

   President Bush, in a new clash with
Congress over China policy, says he'll ignore parts of a spending
package that he considers an infringement on his right to conduct
diplomacy.
   A White House official said today that the action was not an
attempt to assert presidential line-item veto powers.
   ``It's not a line-item veto. As president, he's going to fulfill
the role laid out by the Constitution. He is saying he will not
recognize parts of the legislation that he thinks are
unconstitutional,'' said Stephen Hart, deputy press secretary.
   Bush late Friday signed a $9.8 billion State Department bill
that reinforces sanctions on China and requires that Congress be
notified when such secret missions as national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft's visit last June to Beijing are undertaken.
   The president, at his oceanside home for a three-day weekend,
signed the bill but voiced serious objections to those sections and
several others which he said raised ``constitutional difficulties.''
   The Constitution gives the president exclusive power ``to
receive and appoint ambassadors and to conduct negotiations on
behalf of the United States with foreign governments,'' Bush told
Congress.
   The overall legislation authorizes $4.8 billion for the State
Department and related agencies for the fiscal year that began last
Oct. 1, and another $5 billion for fiscal 1991.
   Bush vetoed an earlier version of the legislation, not only
because of the China sanctions but also due to an amendment that
would have prohibited the administration from seeking third-country
financing of insurgent groups, such as the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Congress dropped that proposal from the current legislation.
U.S. support of the Contras was phased out under a bipartisan
accord with Congress.
   The bill writes into law sanctions identical to those Bush
imposed on China after last May's bloody crackdown in Tiananmen
Square, including a ban on military sales to China and restrictions
on trade and loans.
   Bush declared, ``Legislatively mandated sanctions represent an
unwise constraint upon the president's ability to conduct foreign
policy.''
   However, Bush signed the bill with the assertion he would not
follow sections he considered unconstitutional.
   Some senior White House officials have claimed that the
Constitution grants the president the power to veto individual
parts of legislation, the so-called line-item veto. Many
constitutional scholars dispute that contention.
   Refusal to follow certain sections of the State Department bill
would be tantamount to a line-item veto.
   The Washington Post, in today's editions, quoted an
administration official as saying the administration is considering
a lawsuit over the bill to test the issue. An administration
official told The Associated Press todaythis was not the intent and
there was ``no way'' the administration would initiate such a
lawsuit.
   In Congress, Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Judiciary constitutional rights subcommittee, has said he would sue
Bush if he sought to cast a line-item veto.
   Bush noted the legislation allows him to waive sanctions on
grounds of ``national interest'' and suggested this clause put
enough flexibility into the measure to allow it to escape a veto.
   The sanctions remain in effect for now and Bush has no immediate
plans to lift them, said deputy press secretary Stephen Hart.
   Bush flatly said he would disobey the section of the legislation
that would require the State Department to give Congress a full
report on any politically sensitive secret diplomatic contacts.
   The restriction was an outgrowth of the clandestine trip to
Beijing last June, shortly after the Tiananmen Square crackdown, by
Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger. That
trip, coming soon after Bush banned high-level exchanges between
U.S. and Chinese officials, was roundly criticized on Capitol Hill.
   ``Such blanket reporting requirements could be read to compel
the disclosure of sensitive ongoing negotiations,'' Bush said.
   Bush's statement is the latest dispute with Congress over China
policy.
   Earlier this year, the Senate narrowly sustained Bush's veto of
legislation that would have extended visas of Chinese students
studying in the United States. Bush asserted he was affording the
same protection to the Chinese students by executive order.
   The measure he signed also would provide $16 million in start-up
funds for ``TV Marti,'' which will broadcast from the United States
into Cuba and be a sister station to the ``Radio Marti'' that has
operated for several years.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, flew to the snow-covered coastal
community of Kennebunkport on Friday for the three-day Presidents'
Day weekend.
   The Bushes planned to see how remodeling work is progressing on
the family home overlooking the Atlantic. The Bushes are having
rooms remodelled as a gift to each other on their 45th wedding
anniversary last month.
   Only two rooms now can be heated in the winter, a bedroom and a
kitchen.
   Hart said the Bushes planned to spend the weekend ``privately
relaxing,'' with no planned activities and no guests, before
returning to Washington on Monday.

<TEXT>
   Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's
unconventional president, goes to Washington this week to tell the
Bush administration that swift policy changes are needed if America
is to retain its standing among the people of Eastern Europe.
   Although many East Europeans resent the way the West abandoned
them to Stalin more than 40 years ago, the United States is widely
admired as a beacon of freedom.
   In an interview at his lunchtime haunt, the Vikarka restaurant
inside the sprawling presidential castle, Havel indicated that
Washington will have to work hard to keep that standing now that
Europe is changing.
   ``The United States were traditionally seen here as a guarantor
of democracy, and (America) may be more popular here than in other
countries, and rightly so,'' Havel told The Associated Press last
week.
   ``But that doesn't mean that in a radically changing situation _
the process of disintegration of the Soviet bloc _ the United
States will not be called upon to pursue a different policy than to
date.
   ``It is a phenomenon which has to be reflected upon and
projected into the future policy,'' Havel said, leaning over the
table. ``It is my impression that if the United States does this
courageously and quickly, it will be only for its own good.''
   Havel is reluctant to give specifics, particularly before he
outlines his ideas for President Bush during a hectic three-day
visit that begins Monday. He will also address Congress and meet
New York cultural figures.
   Since taking office Dec. 29, Havel has acted decisively to give
new style and substance to Czechoslovak policy.
   Diplomatic relations have been established with Israel and South
Korea. Prague has translated the latitude won by the overthrow of
Stalinism into a new independence toward Moscow, insisting the
Soviets start pulling their hated troops out of Czechoslovakia.
   Havel was only four days in office when he visited both Germanys
and gave guarded approval to reunification, then traveled to Poland
to propose that Prague, Warsaw and Budapest pool economic,
political and other efforts to ``re-enter Europe.''
   In style, Havel has set standards all his own. Donning a suit if
necessary for ceremonial occasions, he otherwise favors the dark
sweaters and corduroy trousers he wore as a dissident playwright.
   Several of his advisers _ rock singer Ladislav Kantor, now chief
of protocol, personal secretary Vladimir Hanzal, castle artist
Joska Skalnik _ have the long hair and beards that complete the
1960s air of this new government.
   The 53-year-old president has meditated with the Dalai Lama,
chatted with American rock star Frank Zappa (Zappa wore the suit),
and admitted to traveling castle corridors on a child's scooter.
   Outsiders may puzzle at such presidential behavior. But Czechs,
who have an ingrained appreciation of the absurd, seem to find it
refreshing and to feel that they have found a real leader.
   Posters and lapel pins of Havel are all over Prague. When he
leaves the restaurant, schoolchildren gather to applaud and shout,
``Long Live Havel!''
   ``Love, desire for understanding, strength of spirit and idea
can radiate forever from our country, if we want this to happen,''
he told his compatriots in a New Year's Day address, suggesting
they make this ``our very own contribution to world politics.''
   ``Let us teach both ourselves and others that politics does not
have to be the art of the possible, especially if what is meant by
this is the art of speculating, calculating ... and pragmatic
maneuvering, but that it also can be the art of the impossible,
that is the art of making both ourselves and the world better,''
Havel urged.
   Discussing the new style of his government, Havel bristled at
the suggestion his administration smacks of American hippies of the
1960s.
   He clearly sees a chance to marry some of the ideas of the 1960s
with the sophistication of the 1980s and what Czechoslovaks learned
from the repression that followed the crushing of liberal reforms
in 1968.
   John Lennon, Zappa and other heroes of the 1960s became symbols
of freedom for Czechoslovak youth through the harsh 1970s and 1980s.
   ``The phenomenon known as the '60s was indeed a sort of
inspiration'' for Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution last year,
Havel said.
   ``But 20 years has elapsed since then, the world is different,''
he added. Hippies, students, Vietnam draft dodgers and others
``were predominantly movements of protest, anti-establishment
movements which developed into destructive movements, destroying
the ossified old structures but unable to offer something new,
something better.
   ``The inevitable outcome was that the hippies cut their hair,
put on their suits and became law-abiding Americans,'' Havel said.
   ``In our case, especially the younger generation _ which is
partly inspired by the nonconformism of the 60s, faces a duty to do
it better, to provide a concrete program, to enter politics.''
   Feeling that society was calling him to inspire such efforts,
Havel agreed during the revolution to become president.
   He still insists, ``I would much rather be a writer than a
president.'' But he is visibly enjoying the job, and there is a
widespread feeling in Prague that this unique president is going to
be in the castle beyond June's free election, breathing fresh
spirit into world and domestic politics for some time to come.

   There are just 15 houses in the spot on the map
known as ``Pigsville,'' but residents say that when the doomed
enclave is destroyed next year in a bridge-rebuilding project it
will be the end of a close-knit way of life.
   The fate of one of Milwaukee's oldest and most stable
blue-collar neighborhoods has been sealed by the very bridge that
has given it an identity the last 80 years.
   Pigsville, on the bank of the Menomonee River west of downtown,
will be destroyed in 1991 when the mammoth Wisconsin Avenue Bridge
whose approach forms one of its borders is rebuilt under a $15.3
million project.
   ``There's a lot of irony in it. It's a unique, special
neighborhood that now will be gone, resigned to the history
books,'' said Alderman Michael Murphy, whose district includes
Pigsville.
   The 40 or so residents who have lived in the neighborhood _ many
for decades _ will be relocated starting in August.
   They'll be leaving behind the asphalt-tile roofs, limestone
basements and creaky stairwells of their century-old homes. They'll
also leave behind the smell of hops from the huge Miller Brewing
Co. brewery across the river, the sounds of crowds cheering at
Milwaukee Brewers games at County Stadium a quarter-mile away and
the plate-rattling vibrations of Soo Line trains that pass on the
western edge of the neighborhood.
   But most of all, the residents will miss the camaraderie that
goes back decades and the privacy of an isolated neighborhood where
crime is rare and friends can venture outside in their bathrobes
for an early-morning chat.
   ``Our biggest fear going somewhere else is neighborhoods don't
get his close,'' said Kim Papp, whose family has lived in Pigsville
since 1922. ``It's a great place to live. We're all going to miss
it.''
   Mrs. Papp, 30, her husband, William, a plumber, and two
daughters live next door to the two-story house where her husband's
father, grandmother and grandmother's sister-in-law still live.
   ``Our daughters are the fifth generation to live down here,''
she said. ``There's a lot of history. Bill's great-grandfather
helped build the Wisconsin Avenue viaduct.''
   That viaduct, the main bridge for the main drag leading toward
downtown, was completed in 1911, boasting concrete arches that
resemble a Roman aqueduct. The bridge is the main symbol for
Pigsville, but it is suffering from long-term deterioration and
must be replaced. And the replacement project will mean the
leveling of the clutch of houses at its base.
   The river, the railroad tracks and the approach to a smaller
bridge to the south form the other boundaries of Pigsville. There's
only one road leading in.
   ``Unless you know where you're going, it's hard to find,'' said
resident Sue Wiederstein. ``There's only one way in and one way
out. It's like a little city suburb. There's no sidewalks. We don't
have driveways or garages. We don't have problems.''
   How the area got its name, which dates back to before the turn
of the century, is a mystery. One story attributes the moniker to a
man who kept pigs, while another holds that the area was named
after a dentist named Dr. Pigg. Yet another says it was named for
iron castings _ known as pigs _ poured from a smelting furnace at a
nearby foundry.
   While residents throughout the Menomonee River valley often
stake claim as members of Pigsville, most agree the 15-home
neighborhood of bungalows and cottages at the base of the viaduct
is the original Pigsville. Early residents were German immigrants,
later supplanted by Slavs.
   Pigsville has had its share of excitement. Occasionally, the
Menomonee is known to rise above its banks with spring rains,
sending water through the streets.
   Roughly once every 10 years, one of the passing Soo Line trains
has derailed, sounding a bone-shaking clamor. At least three times,
despondent people jumped to their deaths from one of the bridges
above.
   But perhaps the single biggest event was in the early 1980s when
neighborhood residents joined together to force the closing of a
popular tavern called Fourth Base because patrons sometimes plucked
flowers from neatly kept gardens or urinated in the road.
   The final chapter is at hand. The bridge project is slated to
begin in 1991 with demolition of the homes and bridge. The new
bridge, which will preserve the original architectural design, will
probably take two years to complete.
   Leonard Bielinsky, 77, a retired shoemaker, reared 11 children
in Pigsville. He and his wife, Irene, moved to their 120-year-old
home in 1950 and expected to live there until they died.
   ``We don't know where we're going. We can't do anything till
they make us an offer. Thrown out. That's how I feel about it,'' he
said.

   Anarchists, communists and advocates of
totalitarian government will be allowed into the United States
under a law signed by President Bush unless officials can find a
reason to keep them out that goes beyond their political beliefs.
   The measure, part of a $9.8 billion State Department
authorization Bush signed Friday night, effectively repeals part of
a 1952 law that barred visitors with radical views.
   Nobel laureates Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Pablo Neruda have
been excluded under the law in recent years as well as authors
Graham Greene, Doris Lessing and Carlos Fuentes, according to a
Senate Foreign Relations Committee report.
   Among others excluded were French actor Yves Montand; former
Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith; Hortensia Allende, widow of the
Marxist president of Chile, and Yasir Arafat, head of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   ``For a generation and more, these miserable provisions made the
United States present itself to other nations as a nation of
fearful, muddled, intimidated citizens,'' said Sen. Daniel
Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   ``The so-called look-out list of excludable aliens maintained by
the State Deparment should be purged of the names of persons
previously considered ineligible because of political beliefs or
associations,'' Moynihan declared.
   Still subject to exclusion under the new measure are ``aliens
who are polygamists or who practise polygamy or advocate the
practice of polygamy.''
   Polygamy itself, but not advocacy of polygamy, is forbidden by
state law in most of the country.
   Lawyers familiar with immigration could not recall any problems
with polygamists visiting the United States, who include many
leaders of Moslem countries.
   The Senate committee report said the new provisions would not
prevent the government from barring visitors on grounds of national
security or foreign policy.
   Others still barred under the law _ but not always in practice _
are the mentally retarded, the insane, criminals, pimps,
prostitutes, paupers, vagrants, professional beggars, stowaways,
drug addicts, chronic alcoholics and those with a dangerous
contagious disease or likely to become burdens on the American
public.
   There is also a ban on, but no definition of, those ``afflicted
with psychopathic personality, or sexual deviation, or a mental
defect.''
   Another undefined but excluded group is: ``Aliens coming to the
United States to engage in any immoral sexual act.''

   A storm blanketed the Sierra Nevada with up to 3 feet of snow,
stranding motorists and cutting power lines, while a freak warm
front in the South brought tornadoes and flooding that drove
hundreds from their homes.
   Snow gave way to freezing rain Friday in an icy trail across the
upper Midwest and the Northeast but power outages caused by earlier
blizzards continued.
   ``Hot wires are falling all over the place,'' said police
dispatcher Rosemarie Million in Erie, Pa.
   The Puget Sound area of Washington was hit for the second
straight year with unusually heavy snowfalls. Seattle had up to 10
inches of snow by Saturday morning and Olympia, to the south, had
an accumulation of 20 inches from snowfalls Wednesday and Friday.
   The area, noted for its rain not its snow, saw two snowfalls in
Seattle last year of about 12 inches each, and Olympia had about
half that last year.
   A few rivers began receding in some areas of the Southeast this
morning, but other rivers were still rising after up to 12 inches
of rain fell on the region. Flooding has claimed at least four
lives since Friday.
   The Ocoee River jumped its banks, swept away a new bridge and
ran 8 feet deep in the streets of Copperhill, Tenn., and across the
river at McCaysville, Ga., where about 500 people were evacuated
from their homes.
   ``There are porches from other houses that have been damaged and
are coming down the river,'' said Russell Newman, a rescue
official. ``I don't know whether you'd call it looting or not, but
I saw some guys fishing stuff out of the river as it floated by.''
   The Ocoee also swamped a footbridge at a Tennessee Valley
Authority hydroelectric dam, flooding the power station and
trapping six TVA workers, who were rescued by helicopter.
   Police in the Atlanta suburb of Smyrna today found the body of a
69-year-old man in a car in a flooded parking lot, where the
vehicle apparently stalled and submerged.
   Churning waters forced the evacuation of up to 1,000 people in
Trion, Ga., about 30 miles south of Chattanooga, Tenn. A man
drowned when his car stalled in floodwaters. This morning, the
Chattooga County sheriff's department said the water receded
several feet overnight and main roads were now open, but that
authorities were not allowing residents back to their homes yet.
   Gerald Birdo of the National Weather Service said the flooding
in some areas of the South was the worst since 1979.
   ``I don't ever recall seeing this much rain in this short a
period,'' said Carl Parker, a 30-year weather service veteran in
Fort Payne, Ala., site of 8 inches of rain in under 24 hours.
   One of many twisters that tunneled through the Southeast
destroyed or damaged 38 homes in Carrollton, Ga.
   ``Some houses looked like they just exploded,'' said Capt.
Robert Lee of the Carroll County Sheriff's Department. ``It looked
like a bomb hit right in the middle of the subdivision.''
   Tornadoes also were recorded in Alabama, South Carolina and
Mississippi.
   About 80 people were evacuated from a flooded rest home in
Cullowhee, in western North Carolina. A man in nearby Transylvania
County was swept away by the rain-swollen French Broad River as he
tried to save his trout farm.
   Rapidly rising waters closed dozens of schools and roads in
northern Alabama, while tornadoes in the southern part of the state
ripped apart mobile homes and shattered trees. At least 200 people
statewide had to leave their homes.
   An elderly woman lost her footing and drowned while fording a
flooded creek near her home in Cherokee County, Ala., in
northeastern Alabama near the Georgia border, said Leon Smith, the
county's emergency management coordinator.
   Meanwhile, the heaviest winter storm in 74 years blanketed Reno,
Nev., with snow that fell at rates of up to 4 inches, and freezing
homes were blacked out by a power outage.
   The snow was so blindingly fast and heavy that even a sled dog
race scheduled to begin today had to be be postponed until Sunday.
   Snow closed nearly 80 miles of Interstate 80 in northern
California on Friday, dumping up to 3 feet of fresh snow on the
mountains, with 2 feet recorded at Placerville and 18 inches in
Auburn.
   At dawn, I-80 still was closed from Auburn to the Nevada state
line, but westbound lanes opened early today for vehicles with tire
chains. U.S. 50 was open to vehicles with chains, which were
required on all mountain roads.
   More snow fell overnight in the Sierra Nevada, with
accumulations of up to 2 feet expected, the National Weather
Service said, but much of the storm was heading east toward Utah
and Wyoming.
   Lyle LaFaver, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric, said
tens of thousands of customers were without power late Friday ``and
they'll probably be out all night.''
   ``We've had problems with very heavy, very wet snow,'' he said.
   In the San Francisco Bay area, wind gusts to 60 mph downed trees
and power lines Friday, and heavy rains caused mud slides and
snarle traffic.

   Glass shards crunched underfoot as Red
Cross workers removed the body of a Lebanese Forces fighter crushed
by his burned-out tank against the wall of a demolished building.
   Gen. Michel Aoun's soldiers warned civilians not to touch
corpses, saying some of them had been booby-trapped by the fleeing
Lebanese Forces militiamen led by Samir Geagea.
   Two other Red Cross workers in bright orange uniforms trudged
through a pile of garbage near the Soviet-made T-54 tank in the
Furn el-Shubbak neighborhood, trying to slip a metal stretcher
under the body of a second militiaman.
   ``We found the lower part of the body near the garbage. The
upper part was 10 yards away,'' said one Red Cross worker as he
waved off swarming flies.
   Parents shooed away youngsters watching the scene.
   ``Where are the other two bodies?'' one harried rescuer asked
his colleague. ``There were four militiamen in the tank.''
   An eerie silence hung over Furn el-Shubbak and Ein Rummaneh on
Saturday, a day after Aoun's soldiers captured the neighboring
districts from the Lebanese Forces after a 16-hour tank assault.
   At least 43 people were killed and 54 wounded in the attack on
the low-income residential districts in Christian east Beirut.
   By police count, more than 600 people have been killed and more
than 1,800 wounded in the 18-day-old showdown for mastery of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Ein Rummaneh and Furn el-Shubbak looked as if they had been
struck by a killer earthquake after the brutal onslaught by Aoun's
pre-dominantly Sunni Moslem ``mukafaha,'' or special corps.
   An acrid stench of incinerated steel mingled with the smell of
corpses.
   Some of the district's densely populated narrow alleys resembled
junkyards piled with burned cars, some compressed into thin sheets
by tanks that had crushed them.
   Tanks and armored personnel carriers rumbled through the dusty
streets as people emerged from bunkers to take stock of the damage
and stockpile food.
   Many threw rice on Aoun's troops from balconies strung with
Lebanese flags as they shouted: ``Long live the army! Long live
Aoun!''
   ``We have finally seen light,'' said Mary Shammas, a housewife.
``The Lebanese Forces was a germ that was squashed by the army. May
God safeguard the army and the general. I'm ready to die for him
(Aoun).''
   Some young women sunned themselves on a pockmarked balcony
overlooking a burned Lebanese Forces armored personnel carrier.
   ``We lived 17 days underground. It's so good to breathe fresh
air again,'' shouted one.
   The 1,500-yard-long Furn el-Shubbak commercial boulevard looked
like a piece of plowed land, strewn with debris, pieces of
furniture and window shutters.
   Aoun's soldiers were defusing mines planted by Geagea's men
around the militia's posts and barracks, now decorated with Aoun
posters and the Lebanese flag.
   A soldier who lost his left eye in the latest clashes stood
guard at the entrance to one of the Lebanese Forces barracks in Ein
Rummaneh.
   ``There's a booby-trapped backgammon board here. No one can go
in. We are waiting for the sappers (bomb squad)'' he said.
   The troops, stationed in nearly every street in the two areas,
warned civilians against touching suspicious-looking objects.
   ``The dirty militiamen have even booby-trapped corpses,'' said
one soldier standing next to a car piled with mines the army had
removed from the edges of Furn el-Shubbak.
   ``We didn't enjoy fighting them but we wanted to liberate our
areas from these filthy people. They left us no other choice,''
said another soldier.
   ``We are taking a small rest now before we attack them in
Ashrafiyeh,'' he added.
   Ashrafiyeh is one of the last two pockets of the Lebanese forces
in east Beirut. The other is the low-income district of Nabaa.
   Reporters and photographers were not allowed to go close to the
Kassardjian barracks, the Lebanese Forces' main barracks in the
area, ``because the area around it is still being cleared of
mines.''
   Workers were singing as they collected garbage next to a red
Volkswagen containing a body wrapped in a plastic bag.
   The wife of a Lebanese Forces militiaman, Pierre Helou, sobbed
as she hugged her two children in Ein Rummaneh:
   ``My poor children. What has happened to your father?''
   ``She doesn't know whether her husband Pierre has been killed or
has surrendered to the army,'' a neighbor said.
   Long lines of cars crowded the lane leading into west Beirut at
the Museum crossing, the only open link between Moslem west Beirut
and the Christian sector.
   Most of the passengers were fleeing Ashrafiyeh in fear of an
Aoun offensive. Very few cars were crossing into east Beirut.

<HEAD>Sandinistas, Opposition Exchange Threats As Tension Rises</HEAD>

   Campaign rhetoric is heating up as
Sunday's elections draw near, with the opposition, government and
rebel guerrillas exchanging threats of vengeance and accusations of
cheating and planned violence.
   The campaign had been relatively tranquil since a Dec. 10
opposition rally turned into a bloody clash, but now the tension is
showing as the Feb. 25 vote approaches and the result remains
uncertain.
   The tone of the campaign darkened as opposition vice
presidential candidate Virgilio Godoy said the Sandinistas would be
forced to pay for their past misdeeds and President Daniel Ortega
responded likewise.
   U.S.-supported Contra guerrillas accused the government of
planning an armed offensive on election day; the Sandinista
government said 2,000 Contras were preparing to disrupt the voting.
   Both sides denied they planned any violence but said they
wouldn't hesitate to respond if provoked.
   Managua residents assessed the situation and advised each other
to stock up on food, water and candles in case there of trouble
after election day.
   ``You never know,'' said one middle-aged woman who did not want
her name used. ``It's better to prevent than to lament.''
   Two polls last week found about 50 percent of respondents
picking Ortega's leftist Sandinistas, with around 30 percent
expressing a preference for Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's
U.S.-supported United National Opposition, a coalition of 14
disparate parties.
   However, the accuracy of any poll is difficult to assess. Not
only is Nicaragua a rural country with few telephones, but many
people are reluctant to express their true feelings after years of
civil war and intimidation.
   Interior Minister Tomas Borge accused the opposition of planning
to disrupt voting in an effort to make a Sandinista victory appear
illegitimate.
   UNO representatives denied that and said they expected to win
easily, but Godoy said that if the Sandinistas set loose
``turbas,'' or gangs of supporters, the opposition would call out
its own supporters.
   ``We won't let ourselves be intimidated by the government,''
Godoy said.
   The Sandinistas, who have ruled since the overthrow of dictator
Anastasio Somoza in 1979, have an interest in appearing to win
fairly because it would put pressure on the United States to reduce
sanctions and other pressures on the government.
   Mrs. Chamorro's campaign manager, Antonio Lacayo, said Friday
that UNO would accept a Sandinista victory if international
observers confirm the vote is fair.
   About 3,000 international observers and journalists plan to
watch the voting. International observers have asked both sides to
control the zeal of their supporters, but over the past week the
campaign atmosphere has been more intense.
   ``We're going to make them pay the bill,'' Ortega told a crowd
of thousands at a rally Wednesday in the northern town of Matagalpa.
   Ortega, who is seeking a second six-year term, used a common
Nicaraguan phrase, ``Vamos a pasarle la cuenta,'' an ominous
expression that threatened retribution against UNO should the
Sandinistas win.
   ``They will be left without a newspaper, and the house of the
lady and that of the vice presidential candidate will be turned
into nurseries for children,'' Ortega told the crowd.
   Mrs. Chamorro laughed off Ortega's threats, even though her
newspaper, La Prensa, was shut down for nearly two years because of
its criticism of government policies. It was allowed to reopen in
October 1988.
   ``How funny. This poor man is saying that because he's already
lost,'' Mrs. Chamorro said.
   Both Mrs. Chamorro and Godoy pointed to increasingly
enthusiastic opposition crowds and said the threats showed the
ruling party was becoming desperate.
   The exchange actually was started by Godoy, who used the same
phrase against the Sandinistas in two speeches, saying ``One by
one, we will make the Sandinistas pay the entire bill.''
   The U.S. State Department expressed concern about Ortega's
statements _ but not Godoy's _ and urged Ortega to commit the
Sandinistas ``to respect the political, civil and human rights of
opposition parties.''
   The statement noted that under international agreements signed
by Ortega, the elections are envisioned as a first step in a
national reconciliation process.
   The Godoy-Ortega exchange marked a change in tone because most
Nicaraguans are hoping for peace after years of civil war, and both
parties had tried to exploit that mood.
   Ortega, for example, bills himself as ``the president of peace''
and urges reconciliation.
   Mrs. Chamorro says her government would be the only one that
could bring peace and reconciliation. She notes the Sandinistas
have the largest armed forces by far in the region and she promises
to ``dump the weapons into the ocean'' if she is elected.

<HEAD>Hopeful Former Governors Heading Down the Comeback Trail</HEAD>

   Former governors, hankering for the power they
once held and perhaps the trappings as well, are heading down the
comeback trail in increasing numbers, hoping to regain the best job
they ever had.
   ``You think you'll like retirement, but after about a year you
miss the crowds,'' says Bruce King, who is trying for a second
comeback and third term as governor of New Mexico.
   ``As governor, you're like the director of the symphony _ in
Congress, you're more like one of the players of instruments,''
said Rep. Joe Brennan, a Democrat who is giving up his House seat
to run for his old job as governor of Maine.
   At a time when politicians complain that the pressures of money
and ethics are driving people out of government, there is no
shortage of experienced candidates for the 36 governor's seats up
for election in 1990.
   In at least eight states, former governors are running for
governor _ not counting incumbents seeking another consecutive
term. And at least three more former governors are considering
running or are being mentioned as possible candidates.
   Some may be engaging in futile gestures or spoiler candidacies,
while others have serious shots at winning.
   Lester Maddox, the one-time segregationist and one-term governor
of Georgia, is a longshot in the Democratic primary this year. At
74, he is a symbol of another era.
   Evan Mecham, impeached in 1988 as governor of Arizona, is a
symbol many Republicans in his state would like to forget. But GOP
leaders say a crowded field could splinter the opposition and allow
him to make a strong showing.
   Former Texas Gov. Mark White, defeated for re-election four
years ago, is a strong Democratic contender and may have recovered
from the fallout over the tax increase and no pass-no play high
school sports rule he pushed as governor.
   Other former governors running or likely to run include
Republican Richard Snelling in Vermont and Democrats Fob James in
Alabama and John Carlin in Kansas.
   In Alaska, Republican Walter Hickel, who served in the 1960s and
was a spoiler independent candidate four years ago, is considering
another run, and Democrat Bill Sheffield, who served one troubled
term in the 1980s, hasn't ruled out another try. In Nevada, former
Gov. Bob List's name is being floated by Republicans looking for a
challenger.
   ``It's the best job in America,'' said Michele Davis, executive
director of the Republican Governors Association.
   ``A U.S. senator _ how many jobs does he get (to fill)? Maybe
40,'' she said, explaining some of the allure. ``A state governor _
we're talking thousands. ... It's pure power.''
   Some of the interest in returning to the Statehouse also may be
due to disenchantment with Washington.
   A still-strong congressional seniority system breeds frustration
and some say the stalemate over the federal deficit has engendered
a sense that little if anything ever really gets resolved in the
nation's capital.
   Brennan was the first former governor in two decades to move to
the House, though the Senate has many former governors. But in
either chamber, he said, a former governor is acutely aware of the
limits of his power compared to what he wielded in his old post.
   ``There's no question you have the levers of government much
more available to you,'' he said. ``You're not bogged down in any
seniority system because there is no seniority.''
   ``You can make a difference _ you are the chief executive,''
said King. ``Up there (on Capitol Hill), you're just one of 400 and
some odd.''
   Few have shown more unabashed enthusiasm for the governor's job
than King in New Mexico.
   He first won election as governor in 1970 after serving as
speaker of the state House. Barred by law from a second consecutive
term, he returned to his cattle ranch in 1975 and planned his
comeback. He won another four-year term in the 1978 election.
   Now 65 and eight years out of the governor's mansion in Sante
Fe, King is waging another comeback bid.
   Davis, who heads the national Republican group that will try to
defeat King if he wins the Democratic primary, offers ungrudging
professional admiration.
   ``Bruce King is truly one of the best polticians I have ever
seen,'' Davis said. ``He can work a room like nobody _ remember
names, everything. But he is the past. Others are the future.''
   Now that New Mexico has changed its constitution to allow
governors to succeed themselves, King makes no secret that he has
two more terms in mind.
   ``I enjoy campaigning,'' he said. ``I must.''

<HEAD>Three Killed When Police Fire on Moslem Protesters in Kashmir</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SRINAGAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security forces fired on hundreds of
pro-independence Moslems who tried to grab their guns Saturday, and
three people were killed and two were wounded, officials said.
   A government spokesman for Jammu-Kashmir state, Syed Ghulam
Nabi, said the officers of the paramilitary Central Reserve Police
Force opened fire in self-defense.
   The crowd had gathered during a relaxation of the curfew that
has been in effect on-and-off in Srinagar since Jan. 20, when the
government began a crackdown on the Moslem secessionist movement.
   Nabi said the violence broke out in the Nawa Bazaar neighborhood
of Srinagar, the city that is the focal point of the Moslem
independence movement. Curfew was imposed in the area immediately
after the noon incident, he said.
   In the rest of the Moslem-dominated city, the curfew was
re-imposed at 6 p.m. as scheduled after a 13-hour break.
   Nabi said the dead were a woman and two men. He said two people
were injured.
   Witnesses said that a half-hour before the shootings, troops
fired in the air at Nawa Bazaar to disperse another group of
demonstrators and clubbed some on the head with rifle butts.
   At least 12 people, including two boys, were injured in the
beating, said doctors at a hospital where the injured were taken.
   Salima, a 48-year-old wool saleswoman who gave only one name,
said she was hit on the head by a policeman during the melee. She
said she got caught in the violence while walking to the market to
sell her wool.
   Later, a police station in Srinagar was set afire, and police
blamed Moslem militants. The blaze spread to an adjoining
handicrafts shop, damaging both buildings.
   Reporters on the scene said some residents tried to stop
firefighters from dousing the blaze.
   Other reporters said a police bus parked outside a police
station in central Srinagar exploded and caught fire when suspected
militants hurled a bomb at it.
   The driver, the only occupant, drove the burning bus away from
the congested neighborhood to a deserted bridge 200 yards away and
jumped to safety, said the reporters who refused to be identified.
   At least 99 people, most of them Moslem militants shot for
defying curfew, have been killed since Jan. 20 in the Kashmir
region.
   Moslem militants in Kashmir had originally demanded either union
with neighboring Pakistan, which is Moslem, or total independence,
but in recent months they have increasingly campaigned for the
status of a neutral country.
   Kashmir is a part of Jammu-Kashmir state. About 64 percent of
Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are Moslem, making it the only
Moslem-dominated state among India's 25 states. Nationwide, Moslems
comprise 12 percent of the 880 million population. Hindus make up
82 percent.

   A woman donated $15,000 worth of jewelry to
the Central Bank on Saturday to help the country's troubled economy.
   Alia Abu Tayeh, a senior adviser at the Education Ministry, said
the donation ``is the least any Jordanian citizen can do to aid her
country.''
   ``What is the use of me living happily while Jordan is broke?''
she told The Associated Press after discussing her gift with Prime
Minister Mudar Badran and Parliament Speaker Suleiman Arar.
   Ms. Abu Tayeh, whose grandfather fought alongside King Hussein's
family in the Arab revolt against Ottoman colonial rule, said the
jewelry includes gold and diamond-studded bracelets, necklaces and
rings.
   Last week, deputy Nayef Al-Haddid urged all Jordanians to loan
their jewelry to the Central Bank for five years to help it
overcome a shortage of foreign currency reserves.
   Jordan's economic problems started in 1988 due to rising
payments on its $8.3 billion debt and declining foreign revenues.
There were four days of riots in April 1989 over worsening economic
conditions.

   Clemson University's student body
president, who this past week reviewed and approved the school's
toughened alcohol policy, has been charged with driving under the
influence, authorities said.
   William Astor Blackwood III, a 21-year-old senior, was arrested
early Friday by a university police officer. Blackwood's blood
alcohol content registered .16 percent, the police report said.
Anything over .10 is illegal in South Carolina.
   After a 14-member committee of students and faculty agreed on
changes in the school's on-campus alcohol policy, their
recommendations were presented for approval by Blackwood and the
dean of students before the final OK was given by university
President Max Lennon.
   ``Students took this process very seriously and contributed many
of the ideas in the final policy,'' Blackwood said Tuesday.
   Blackwood is scheduled to go to trial March 15.

   A decade ago, Janet Mullins, a 30-year-old
single mother with a background in retailing and real estate and a
recent college degree, took a job typing letters in a Senate office
as a first step to a meaningful career in politics.
   In a meteoric rise that would make the producers of the movie
``Working Girl'' gulp, Mullins was made chief of staff in Sen.
Robert Packwood's office _ less than two years after she started
working for the Oregon Republican. She more than doubled her
$18,000 salary in that time.
   Mullins quit the job after a year to return to Kentucky, but
parlayed the Packwood post into series of plum jobs. And after
working in the Bush presidential campaign, she was appointed
assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs.
   A self-described ``Senate animal,'' the 40-year-old Mullins _ a
Democrat until she went to work for Packwood _ is the State
Department's chief lobbyist on Capitol Hill.
   She also reportedly is dating one of the capital's most powerful
and eligible Democrats: Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of
Maine, her adopted party's principal nemesis in the Senate.
   A young-looking, businesslike brunette who says she shies away
from profile stories, Mullins said in an interview the secret of
her success is simple: ``hard work,'' and an eye for good
opportunities.
   Then again, Mullins hasn't had much time for reflection in the
last decade, what with raising her daughter, Shannon, now an
18-year-old college student in Colorado, and routinely working long
hours.
   Luck and timing have also played a role. Take, for instance, her
decision to join the Bush campaign.
   She was ``about two days away from accepting a job'' with the
presidential campaign of Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
in 1987 when Lee Atwater ``called and said, `Don't make a decision
until I can talk with you,''' Mullins said.
   Atwater, the Republican National Committee chairman, ran George
Bush's presidential campaign.
   Rejecting the advice of several friends, Mullins went with Bush
because ``he was an excellent candidate,'' his campaign
organization ``was the A-team from the beginning,'' and the Bush
operatives convinced her she would have ``a role that would be
satisfying for me,'' she said.
   Although she was a neophyte in presidential campaigns, she was
named executive director of the Fund for America's Future, Bush's
political action committee.
   ``She has a reputation for being tough,'' says a former boss,
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., but he added that Mullins is actually
``more bark than bite.'' He also calls her ``extraordinarily
bright.''
   Packwood has even cited Mullins in his speeches as an example of
how one can succeed quickly by dint of hard work and intelligence.
   Others describe Mullins as politically insightful, capable and
private.
   So private, in fact, that she refuses to talk about the nature
of her relationship with Mitchell, although she doesn't deny it.
Mitchell, who was divorced three years ago, also doesn't discuss
his personal life, spokeswoman Diane Dewhirst said.
   ``Rumor? It's not a rumor,'' McConnell said when asked about a
Mullins-Mitchell relationship. McConnell hired Mullins to run his
successful 1984 Senate campaign in which he upset incumbent Walter
Huddleston. Mullins then became McConnell's chief of staff.
   In a town where two-career couples are common, such separation
of personal and professional lives _ Democrat and Republican _ is
not unusual.
   ``It hasn't been a problem for me,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. ``I like her. She is a charming young lady.''
   Mullins' predecessor in the State Department position, J. Edward
Fox, said access to the leadership can be a big plus in the job,
which he said was ``very tough.'' The administration's foreign
policy is a ``good whipping boy'' for members of Congress, he said.
   While Mullins declines to talk about her social life, she's not
closed-month about other aspects of her work.
   ``The neat part of my job is that I personally represent the
secretary's and the administration's point of view. My job when I
walk into a meeting is to know what (Secretary of State James)
Baker would want ... what the president wants,'' she says, leaning
back in her chair in a large sunny office on the State Department's
seventh floor.
   Supervising a staff of 50, Mullins and her team track
legislation and advance the administration's foreign policy goals
on Capitol Hill, where members often have their own ideas.
   ``Because the White House legislative affairs office has the
entire agenda to deal with, they really rely upon us and the NSC
(the National Security Council) to honcho the foreign policy side
of things,'' she said.
   While Mullins gets ``on the phone with members and staff people
to the extent I can,'' she usually relies on feedback from staff.
She comes to Capitol Hill for big events like Baker's testimony
before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   From a professional standpoint, 1990 started off well for
Mullins when the Senate gave President Bush a big victory by
sustaining his veto of a bill that imposed sanctions on China. The
House had overridden the veto.
   Generally, Mullins and her operation receive good marks, but
some members have their gripes.
   ``Sometimes they do well,'' said Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., a
member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ``Sometimes they
come to us late. ... There have been some hot issues, they came to
us late in the game.''
   Others don't have an opinion.
   ``Who?'' asked Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., when questioned about
Mullins. ``I haven't been lobbied by anyone in the
administration,'' said Biden, a leading Democrat on the Foreign
Relations Committee.

   Here are some of the major figures in Japanese
politics whose futures may be decided by Sunday's general election
for the 512-seat lower house of Parliament.
   The Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed Japan since the
party was formed in 1955, faced a serious challenge to its majority
in the lower house, which chooses the prime minister, amid public
dislike of a new 3 percent sales tax and criticism of party
leaders' involvement in an influence-buying scandal.

   Kaifu, 59, is a 10-term member of the Diet, or parliament, from
Aichi Prefecture (state) in central Japan. He was catapulted to the
Liberal Democratic Party's top post in August when Prime Minister
Sousuke Uno resigned. Kaifu promised to revise an unpopular sales
tax and to reform a system dependent on large corporate donations
to oil politics, but few measures have been taken. A former
education minister without a firm power base in the party, Kaifu
has been plagued by rumors that power brokers plan to replace him
soon after the election.

   Charismatic Ms. Doi, 61, has been head of the largest opposition
party since 1986. She was a law professor before running for
Parliament in 1969, and is seeking her eighth term from Hyogo
Prefecture in western Japan. She has gained fame at home and abroad
as her party encouraged the emergence of women in local and
national politics and made impressive gains in the upper house of
Parliament last July, with many women winning seats. Favoring an
unarmed, neutral Japan, the Socialists oppose the U.S.-Japan
security treaty, which places 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan, and
support protectionist farm trade policies.

the world spotlight with his first-name relationship with President
Reagan. Often criticized as a ``weathervane'' who changed political
ties and policies to advance his career, Nakasone declared his
guiding principle was that Japan should ``hold a place of honor in
the international community.'' Although never charged with
wrongdoing in the Recruit scandal, he was forced to testify in
Parliament about his links to the scandal last year and resigned
from the party. Running as an independent, he hopes for a strong

resigned over the Recruit scandal last year, he was spared most of

<HEAD>Actress-Wife of Cornel Wilde Dead at 66</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jean Wallace, the film actress of
the 1940s and 1950s whose off-screen escapades fueled Hollywood
gossip, died at home after an internal hemorrhage, officials said.
She was 66.
   Miss Wallace, the wife of actor Cornel Wilde from 1951 to 1980,
died Wednesday at her home here, family members said Friday.
   The cause of death was ruled to be an upper gastrointestinal
hemorrhage, said Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Bob
Dambacher.
   Born Jean Walasek in Chicago on Oct. 12, 1923, she came west in
1940 and worked as a showgirl at Earl Carroll's legendary Hollywood
nightclub.
   As a Paramount contract player, she appeared in the 1941 musical
``Louisiana Purchase.'' Her other 1940s films included ``You Can't
Ration Love,'' ``It Shouldn't Happen to a Dog,'' ``Blaze of Noon,''
``When My Baby Smiles at Me,'' and ``Jigsaw.''
   She married actor Franchot Tone in 1941 and the couple had two
sons before a 1948 divorce. She married James Lloyd Randall, but
the marriage was annulled after a few months.
   She married Wilde in 1951 and they had a son before divorcing in
1980. Wilde died of leukemia on Oct. 16, 1989.
   The blonde leading lady's highly-publicized personal life
included a sleeping pill overdose in 1946, hospitalization in 1949
for a self-inflicted knife wound and bitter child-custody squabbles
with Tone in 1951.
   Her later films were produced primarily for Theodora
Productions, a company she and Wilde created. Her credits from that
period include ``Storm Fear,'' ``The Devil's Hairpin,'' ``Lancelot
and Guinevere,'' and her last film, ``No Blade of Grass,'' a 1970
picture praised for its anti-pollution theme.
   Beside her children, survivors include a brother, a sister and
three grandchildren.

   Ronald Reagan was in front of the camera
again, with lawyers hanging on his every word as the former
president produced a videotaped version of his recollection of the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Reagan testified behind closed doors for about six hours Friday
and returned for a second session today, answering questions about
his role in the Iran-Contra affair, the failed arms-for-hostages
deal during Reagan's second term.
   Reagan was compelled to testify in the case by U.S. District
Judge Harold Greene, who is presiding over the trial of former
White House National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter in
Washington, D.C.
   The former president's blue luxury car pulled up in a pounding
rainstorm at about 9:30 a.m. today. Poindexter arrived by taxi
about 15 minutes earlier, bounding through the rain and past a
throng of reporters on his way into the courthouse.
   As they did Friday, both men ignored reporters' questions
outside the courthouse.
   The former president was to face 154 questions, which were drawn
from 183 submitted to the court by defense attorney Richard
Beckler. The attorney was allowed follow-up questions if necessary
but the judge prohibited him from raising additional questions on
new subjects.
   On Friday, Greene had estimated that the president would wind up
the taping by lunchtime today.
   Security was especially rigorous for the extraordinary session,
which began Friday morning at the federal courthouse in downtown
Los Angeles. Reporters were kept more than 100 yards away.
   In deference to the former president, Greene allowed Reagan, 79,
to give videotaped testimony near his Bel-Air area home rather than
require him to appear in person at Poindexter's trial in Washington.
   On Friday, Reagan entered the courtroom a few minutes after
Poindexter, and the two exited separately about 6{ hours later.
   The former security adviser goes on trial March 5 on charges of
concealing from Congress assistance by his former aide, Oliver
North, to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels and lying about a 1985
shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   Poindexter sought the former chief executive's testimony to
bolster his contention that his secret activities had been
authorized by Reagan.
   ``I think he was very fair in his testimony,'' Beckler said of
the president as he left court.
   Greene threw out 29 of Beckler's questions because they lacked
relevance or touched too closely to national secrets.
   Cross-examination was to be conducted by Dan K. Webb, the chief
prosecutor for Iran-Contra independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.
   Although the judge has not made the specific questions public,
he said they fell into several broad categories, such as the extent
of Reagan's knowledge of the shipment of missiles to Iran and
Reagan's understanding of legislation that barred, temporarily,
U.S. aide to the Contras.
   Reagan said early in 1987 that he hadn't known about ``secret
bank accounts and diverted funds,'' two products of the Iran-Contra
affair that he said he found ``personally distasteful.'' He told
the Tower Commission he didn't know the National Security Council
staff was assisting the Contras.
   Poindexter subsequently told Congress he believed Reagan
understood that ``North was instrumental in keeping the Contras
supported without maybe understanding the details of exactly what
he was doing.''
   Greene earlier rejected a request by news organizations to
attend the deposition. However, he said he would order the
videotape released within a few days, after editing to remove
material deemed to touch on classified matters.

<HEAD>Ethnic Anger Engulfs Soviet Central Asia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the deserts of Turkmenia to the glacier-laced
peaks of Tadzhikistan, Soviet Central Asians are venting their
anger over nationalist issues as they awaken from decades of
complacency.
   Dangerous ingredients that have been brewing for decades _
suppression of Islam, joblessness, pollution and a burgeoning
population _ have come to a boil, and they pose dangerous new
challenges for the Kremlin.
   In some cases, the emotions have exploded into violence. Since
1986, more than 120 people have been killed in ethnic clashes in
the region.
   Stretching over an area half the size of the United States and
home to 49 million people, Soviet Central Asia is becoming the
nation's heartland, but also one of its biggest headaches.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is well aware of the dangers as
he tries to reverse decades of neglect of the environment, culture
and religion.
   ``This is a kind of chain reaction accompanied by an orgy of
violence,'' Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet legislature last week
during the most recent outbreak of ethnic violence in Tadzhikistan.
   ``The country's destiny and the safety of our citizens is at
stake, comrades. We must do everything to put out the fire,''
Gorbachev said.
   Soviet Central Asia has been in flames before. It was a
crossroads for invading Mongols, Turks, Persians and Slavs until it
was absorbed in Czarist Russia's drive south in the 19th century.
   In modern times, the Central Asians have fought each other.
   In 1986, the bloodiest Soviet ethnic riots in decades broke out
in Alma Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan, following the replacement
of the republic's party leader, a Kazakh, by an ethnic Russian. Two
people were killed.
   That same year _ in a prelude to the riots that began last week
_ 3,000 people rioted in Dushanbe, the capital of Tadzhikistan.
Reports spoke of an unspecified number of injuries.
   Last May, bands of young people frustrated with high prices and
consumer shortages rioted in two cities of the Turkmenia republic
bordering Iran.
   Then in June, a large-scale rampage of arson and murder
involving ethnic Uzbeks and Meskhetian Turks _ forcibly deported to
Central Asia by Stalin in 1944 _ tore through Uzbekistan's Fergana
Valley. About 100 people were killed.
   Later that month, four people died in the Kazakhstan city of
Novy Uzen when rioters attacked immigrants from the Caucasus,
accusing them of setting up private business and getting special
housing and other privileges.
   Similar factors fueled riots that exploded Feb. 10 in Dushanbe,
where 20 people have been reported killed.
   As many as 200,000 of the republic's 5.1 million people are
reported to be unemployed and housing is in short supply in
Dushanbe for the large families that are traditional among Central
Asians.
   Young villagers living in tents since an earthquake destroyed
their homes in January 1989 have been identified as rioters in
Dushanbe. They reportedly were enraged by rumors that Armenian
refugees fleeing ethnic violence in the Caucasus were being given
apartments.
   The protesters' demands have included banning the sale of pork,
which Moslems do not eat, and introducing measures to combat
unemployment. They also want the Tadzhik language to use the Arabic
script instead of Cyrillic.
   Other problems include animosity between the indigenous
population and immigrants, many of whom have better skills and
therefore receive better jobs and better housing.
   Demographics are an important factor in the unrest.
   A population boom in the five Central Asian republics _
Tadzhikistan, Turkmenia, Kazakhstan, Kirgizia and Uzbekistan _
means that in many areas, there are more people than jobs. A Soviet
legislator has estimated that 6 million young people are not
working or studying in Central Asia.
   The population boom has political ramifications. It threatens to
shift the power balance, which now favors European Slavs in the
north, to the Moslems in the south. The Central Asian republics now
account for 17 percent of the total Soviet population, compared
with 15 percent in 1979 and 11 percent in 1959.
   Western demographers say Central Asia could hold the majority of
the Soviet population within a century if current birthrates
continue. Tadzhikistan has the highest birthrate of all 15 Soviet
republics, with its population increasing 34.5 percent in the last
decade.
   Most of the residents of the broad area separating the country's
Slavic heartland from Iran, Afghanistan and China are of Moslem
heritage, and have taken advantage of the freedoms Gorbachev has
offered to assert their religious interests.
   The number of students in Islamic academies is increasing along
with the publication of the Koran and other religious books. The
Kremlin is removing a Stalin-era ban on group religious education
and plans to allow believers to organize charities.
   Last year, the spiritual leader of Central Asia's Moslems was
ousted after radicals accused him of corruption and ignorance of
Islam.
   In Central Asia, as elsewhere, the deteriorating environment has
become a rallying point.
   National policy demanding increased cotton production has led to
overuse of fertilizers, increasing infant mortality in some places
to as high as 70 per 1,000 live births, seven times the U.S. rate.
Pushing marginal land into production has ruined hundreds of
thousands of acres.
   Rivers tapped to irrigate the cotton crop on arid land have
dried up nearly half the Aral Sea between Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan, making its revival one of the Soviet Union's most
pressing environmental concerns.

   Superpower leaders are expected to sign two
big and three small treaties in 1990, the year of arms control, and
the proposed pacts mark a big change in the way Moscow views its
security interests.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who for the past five years
has amazed the West with sweeping arms proposals, made dazzling
concessions over the past two weeks, clearing the way for a
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and a multilateral pact to
cut conventional armies in Central Europe.
   The treaties, which are qualitatively different than previous
arms control pacts, reflect the change in Soviet thinking on
security issues, say U.S. and Soviet arms control officials and
experts.
   The changes in Kremlin thinking, sparked in large measure by an
economic crisis within the Soviet Union, have prompted the
Gorbachev generation to scrap the doctrine that guided Kremlin
leaders during the four decades of the Cold War: that they needed
an East European military alliance as a buffer against possible
aggression from the West.
   And both superpowers have decided that the world would be safer
with fewer nuclear weapons, reversing a four-decade build-up.
   ``Someplace, there is a museum of old `vital interests' that
nations could no longer afford to defend,'' said Albert Carnesdale,
an arms control expert at Harvard University.
   Several of the agreements are likely to be signed at a summit
this June in Washington, U.S. and Soviet officials say.
   President Bush and Gorbachev are likely to sign a START
framework agreement in June, instructing negotiators to hammer out
the remaining details of the 1,500-page document for signing by
year's end, said one Soviet official, speaking on condition he not
be further identified.
   In June, the two leaders also are expected to sign protocols
designed to ease Senate ratification of two minor treaties from the
1970s limiting underground nuclear tests.
   And agreement is near on a bilateral pact under which the
superpowers would destroy most of their chemical weapons.
Multilateral negotiations continue for a global ban.
   In the most notable recent Soviet concession, Gorbachev dropped
opposition to Bush's proposal that the United States retain 30,000
troops in Britain and southern Europe under a treaty reducing
conventional armies in Central Europe.
   Bush's plan would allow the superpowers to keep 195,000 troops
apiece in Central Europe, mostly in Germany.
   Gorbachev also waived his opposition to the reunification of
East and West Germany.
   Those concessions, and others designed to speed work on START _
which would reduce superpower strategic nuclear arms by 30 percent
_ prompted some Western commentators to describe the Soviet Union
as a failing power.
   U.S. and Soviet arms negotiators, however, reject that argument,
saying Gorbachev's flexibility reflects a changing perception of
national security, and the wish of Kremlin leaders to concentrate
on domestic affairs.
   ``No one is holding a gun to our head. We are negotiating
agreements on the basis of our security interests _ what is good
for us,'' said one Soviet official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Gorbachev was willing to allow the 30,000 U.S. troops to stay on
the European periphery because far more Soviet forces will remain
within the Soviet Union, far closer to the potential battlefield
than American reserves.
   A U.S. arms control official agreed, saying the Soviets ``are
preoccupied with their internal problems, and they want to minimize
the time their top leaders will spend on internal questions.''
   The Soviets have accelerated work on arms control treaties ``by
coming to the U.S. position in a couple of cases, but the U.S.
positions were not cutthroat,'' said the American official, also
speaking on condition he not be further identified.
   ``They are not rolling over completely,'' he said, but want to
close deals this year, and are ``willing to push some hard
questions down the road.''
   Among the issues that have been moved to later negotiations are
Soviet efforts to draw the United States into talks on naval arms
control, limitations on sea-launched cruise missiles and a
superpower disagreement on how to count fighter aircraft in Europe.
   The nuclear, conventional and chemical treaties differ from arms
control pacts of the 1970s by requiring the superpowers to scrap
large numbers of arms, including new weapons systems. The treaties
of the 1970s limited the numbers of weapons, but did not require
destruction of significant quantities.
   ``By and large, in the past, arms control agreements codified
defense plans,'' said Carnesdale. ``What has changed is that our
defense plans have built into them an expectation of arms control.''

   Powerful tobacco interests that have ruled
Virginia since Colonial times may be losing clout as legislators
prepare to join their counterparts in 44 other states in passing a
law to restrict smoking in public.
   How influential the tobacco lobby remains will be shown by
whether the General Assembly approves the stronger or weaker of two
bills that have survived initial votes in the House of Delegates
and the Senate.
   The success of both bills so far shows the increasing clout of
health groups that have battled well-financed tobacco interests
over public smoking for years, lawmakers and lobbyists say.
   ``When you see bills introduced in Virginia, what more can you
say?'' said Athena Mueller, general counsel for Action on Smoking
and Health, an anti-smoking lobby based in Washington.
   Anti-smoking activists attribute their success to recent medical
reports on the harm caused by second-hand smoke and the waning
political influence of rural counties where tobacco is the No. 1
cash crop.
   Virginia, the nation's fifth biggest producer of tobacco, is
among six states with no statewide limits on smoking in public. The
others are North Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri, Alabama and Wyoming.
   States such as Illinois and Kentucky merely limit smoking in
schools, Ms. Mueller said, but 30 to 35 states have relatively
strong anti-smoking laws that cover a variety of public places.
   Tobacco lobbyists concede they have been forced to accept
smoking regulations because of the growing strength of smoking
opponents.
   ``The anti-smoking zealots are much louder than smokers,'' said
Tom Lauria, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute in Washington.
``They're able to get their point across to both the media and to
the lawmakers. I don't think the smokers are doing that.''
   But Lauria said the tobacco industry continues to influence
legislators. The weaker Virginia bill ``has been drafted at least
in part by tobacco interests,'' he said.
   The bill's sponsor, Delegate C. Richard Cranwell, and the
Tobacco Institute's chief Virginia lobbyist, Anthony F. Troy, have
vehemently denied the tobbaco lobby is behind the weaker bill as a
way of forestalling the other one.
   ``There are provisions in that bill that we object to,'' Troy
said.
   The House-passed bill sponsored by Cranwell, a Democrat from
Roanoke County, would ban smoking in elevators, school buses,
school common areas and hospital emergency rooms and require
no-smoking areas in government buildings.
   But it would also limit cities and counties from passing tough
new local smoking ordinances and require employers to have the
support of two-thirds of their workers before banning smoking in
the workplace.
   Troy said the tobacco industry thinks the bill's guidelines for
local ordinances are too stringent.
   A Senate-passed bill would ban or limit smoking in a wide range
of public places, allow localities to make ordinances as strict as
they want and let employers forbid smoking in the workplace.
   Anti-smoking ordinances already in effect in nearly two dozen
Virginia localities, including some of the state's most populous
counties and cities, would remain intact under either bill. The
differences between the two measures probably will be resolved by a
committee of legislators from both chambers, said Sen. Thomas J.
Michie Jr., a Democrat from Albemarle, sponsor of the Senate bill.
The two chambers must act before their adjournment March 10.
   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who took office last month, has not
endorsed either bill, saying he preferred to let the legislators
work the issue out among themselves first.
   Michie, who saw his legislation narrowly defeated last year,
attributed the turnaround to medical warnings about passive smoke
and constituent pressure.
   ``I don't think interest groups have a great deal of influence
when the citizenry feels strongly about something,'' he said.
   Health groups are divided about the smoking legislation.
   David L. Bailey Jr., a lobbyist for heart, lung and cancer
associations, said the weaker bill would satisfy them. ``It's a
good half a loaf,'' he said.
   But other health activists see the tobacco lobby behind the
bill. Anne Morrow Donley, executive director of the Virginia Group
to Alleviate Smoking in Public, said she would rather see no
statewide law than the Cranwell bill.
   ``When the tobacco industry sees that it is inevitable that some
law is going to go through, then they do what Cranwell has done,''
she said. ``They get a weak bill, as weak as they can get it and
they tie the localities' hands.''

   Former President Gustav Husak and
other ex-leaders, including some forced from power in the
pro-democracy revolution, were expelled Saturday from the Communist
Party, official media reported.
   The expulsions were announced during a session of the party's
Central Committee, the CTK news agency said.
   Husak became party chief in 1969 after the Soviet-led invasion
of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, which crushed the Prague Spring
reform movement.
   He was replaced as party chief in December 1987 by Milos Jakes
but continued as president until resigning Dec. 10 during the
peaceful revolution that led to one-time dissident Vaclav Havel
assuming the office.
   Also ousted from the party Saturday was former Premier Lubomir
Strougal, who resigned from his government position on Oct. 11,
1988 after criticism from inside the Communist Party.
   He was replaced by Ladislav Adamec, who is now leader of the
declining Communist Party.

<HEAD>Mayoral Rival Won't Call for Barry's Resignation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   David Clarke is running for mayor of the
nation's capital and already is just a step away from getting the
job, eight months before the election.
   Clarke, the only white candidate for mayor in this predominantly
black city, would automatically become acting mayor if incumbent
Marion Barry stepped down because of his indictment last week by a
federal grand jury.
   The 46-year-old City Council chairman says, however, that he
doesn't want the job that way.
   ``I am not a candidate for acting mayor,'' Clarke said. ``I'm
not calling for (Barry's) resignation.''
   He says that if he succeeded Barry before the Nov. 6 election it
could upset many blacks, who make up 70 percent of the population
of the District of Columbia.
   ``Our community is going through a difficult time,'' Clarke
said. ``It's going through mourning.''
   He says he knows that a number of blacks are concerned over
whether Barry has been treated fairly. In any case, he says,
Washingtonians need to ``restore their dignity'' by voting for the
next mayor and not have one foisted on them.
   Barry was indicted Thursday on three felony counts of lying to a
federal grand jury and five misdemeanor counts of cocaine
possession. He was arrested Jan. 18 in a sting operation in a
downtown hotel.
   Barry, in a statement released by his aides, said he would be
exonerated at his trial and added that he was not considering a
resignation. Under city law, he can serve as mayor unless he is
jailed after being convicted.
   Clarke, asked in a recent interview about his chances of being
elected, said, ``I'm staking my career on it.'' He stressed his
ties in Washington, where he was born and schooled.
   He was director of the local branch of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference in the 1960s and part of the campaign that
led Congress to grant home rule to the city in 1973. He said he
doubts that race will be a major factor in the voting.
   ``I am not hearing it, and I do not think it is a feeling of the
majority of the voters in this city,'' Clarke said. ``If I thought
it was a dominant feeling, why would I take this gamble?''
   Clarke pointed out that before winning the chairmanship in a
citywide election eight years ago, he represented a racially
diverse ward.
   The next mayor should come from within local politics, he says.
He brands the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who moved here last year, as an
outsider.
   Jackson remains noncommittal about a run for mayor. A Washington
Post poll the day after Barry was arrested showed Jackson as a
strong favorite, with Clarke and other announced candidates well
behind.
   There have been hints that the U.S. attorney for the District of
Columbia, Jay B. Stephens, might accept Barry's resignation as part
of a plea bargain.
   The mayor dropped plans to announce for a fourth term on Jan. 21
_ three days after his arrest _ but has given no sign that he will
not run. He currently is in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation
clinic in Florida while city administrator Carol Thompson heads a
caretaker government.
   Barry says he is being treated for alcoholism.
   If Barry were to resign, Clarke would become acting mayor for up
to 120 days, the deadline for holding a special election. If Barry
were to resign within 60 days of the election, however, Clarke
would be mayor until then.
   Clarke refused to discuss what he would do if Barry resigned and
he automatically became mayor. But he spoke eagerly of the kind of
mayor he would be if the voters choose him in November.
   ``I'd be much more low key,'' he said, contrasting his style to
Barry's.
   ``You won't see any great claims of the Dave Clarke
administration,'' he said. Instead, Clarke says, he would
concentrate on ``getting things done.''
   The 6-foot-5, 250-pound Clarke at times appears disheveled with
shirttail out and necktie askew as he lumbers about the District
Building. Often, he can be seen pedaling a bicycle around town.
   Clarke and his wife, Carole, have been married for 16 years and
friends say their social life is anything but flamboyant.
   His style is in sharp contrast to that of Barry, an impeccably
groomed, self-described ``night owl'' who travels by chauffeured
limousine and relishes his entourage and other trappings of power.
   Clarke characterizes his relationship with Barry as one of
``respect, constructive tension,'' but is noticeably irritated with
the way Barry has reacted to policies Clarke helped establish on
the council.
   ``After 16 years in making policies, we haven't seen enough
realized because of the administration,'' the chairman said.
   The other candidates for mayor are Sharon Pratt Dixon, a utility
company executive and Democratic National Committee member; and
council members John Ray and Charlene Drew Jarvis.

   Despite fears that the planet is heating up,
temperatures in the southeastern United States have actually fallen
1 degree Fahrenheit over the past 30 years, according to a federal
study released Saturday.
   The finding contradicts the widely held notion that pollution in
the atmosphere has already made temperatures start to rise.
   ``It's cooling and getting wetter,'' said George A. Maul. ``This
is quite different from what the computer models suggest should be
going on with global warming.''
   Often-repeated theories of global warming hold that rising
levels of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases are trapping heat
in the atmosphere, causing the so-called greenhouse effect.
   These gases result from burning fuels and other sources.
Computers programmed to run complex mathematical formulas predict
that if the gases continue to build up, temperatures around the
world will jump between roughly 3 and 8 degrees Fahrenheit over the
next century.
   Maul, an oceanographer with the U.S. Commerce Department's
Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami,
presented his findings at a meeting of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.
   He said his work does not definitely prove that global warming
isn't happening. The fall in temperatues ``may be a factor of the
difficulty of calculating global warming on a regional scale. But
it should increase the debate about global warming.''
   Last year, Maul and colleagues produced a report showing that
overall temperatures across the United States have been virtually
unchanged during the past century.
   Two other studies, done by other groups of researchers, suggest
that around the world, temperatures have risen 1 degree in the past
100 years.
   However, some critics have suggested that this rise might be
partially due to increasing urbanization where the temperatures are
recorded. City temperatures are higher than the surrounding
countryside because of the concentration of people.
   Maul's latest data show that from the turn of the century to the
mid-1940s, average temperatures in the Southeast rose a
half-degree. But since then, they have fallen a full degree. So
over nearly a full century, temperatures have dropped half a degree.
   At the same time, annual rainfall in the Southeast has increased
65 millimeters, or roughly 2{ inches, since the turn of the century.
   Maul said he believes that if the heat-trapping gases continue
to increase _ and nothing else changes _ then global temperatures
almost certainly will increase. However, he said, too little is
known about other forces that affect weather, such as ocean
currents and the sun's output, to say with certainty that the
planet will heat up.
   Computerized predictions, known as computer models, produce
widely divergent scenarios of what might happen, especially over
relatively small portions of the Earth.
   The weather is affected by mountains, lakes and other features
on the Earth's surfaces. However, adding all of these features to
the computerized calculations makes the job dauntingly complex.
   Michael E. Schlesinger of the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, who makes computer models, said that accurate
predictions about global warming will require calculations that use
10 times finer detail. And producing a model with this much detail
would require running the world's fastest supercomputer non-stop,
day and night, for 40 years, he said.
   Despite the uncertainties, many climate experts have used the
existing models to speculate about what might happen over the next
century. Among the predictions offered at Saturday's meeting:
   _Diana Liverman of Pennsylvania State University said higher
temperatures and lower rainfall could damage Mexican farming. Corn
output, for instance, in non-irrigated fields could fall by 40
percent.
   _Orman E. Granger of the University of California at Berkeley
said that rising sea levels in the Caribbean would destroy the
beaches, which are crucial to the islands' tourist industry.

<HEAD>Former Politburo Member Dead at 71</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, a conservative former
Politburo member and chief of the Ukrainian Communist Party for 17
years, has died at the age of 71, the Tass news agency said
Saturday.
   Tass said Shcherbitsky died after a long illness on Friday, a
day short of his 72nd birthday.
   The conservative party chief, who ran the Ukraine and its 50
million people with an iron fist, was retired from the ruling
Politburo Sept. 20 in a shake-up orchestrated by President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   He was relieved of his Ukraine post a week later.
   Shcherbitsky was one of the last Politburo members from the days
of former President Leonid I. Brezhnev. Before his removal from
party positions, activists in the Ukraine blamed him and his
followers for slowing down economic and political reform in the
nation's breadbasket and industrial heartland.
   Some Ukrainians blamed him for covering up the radiation damage
from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, for restraining
the local press and for the arrests and harassment of dissidents.
Thirty-one people died and hundreds were hospitalized in the
Chernobyl accident on April 26, 1986. Shcherbitsky was born in the
city of Verkhnedneprovsk in the Ukraine.
   Following service in the Soviet army from 1941 to 1946,
Shcherbitsky began his climb in the Communist Party hierarchy by
being elected second secretary of the Dneprodzerzhinsk City
Committee in 1948.
   In 1961, he was appointed chairman of the Council of Ministers
of the Ukraine and became a member of the Communist Party Central
Committee.
   Shcherbitsky was appointed a member of the Politburo under
Brezhnev in 1971.
   The Tass obituary was signed by Gorbachev and other members of
the Politburo, including Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, Vitaly
Vorotnikov, Yegor Ligachev, Vadim Medvedev and Alexander N.
Yakovlev.

<HEAD>Embattled Dodd Stakes Out Moderate Stance on Salvador Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd can't seem to shake the
criticism on his left from opponents of military aid to El
Salvador, an odd predicament for a longtime foe of administration
policies in Central America.
   Dodd's Wethersfield, Conn., office has been occupied. His name
has been pasted on effigies of death squad victims. In the latest
campaign, college students in the Northeast are receiving phony
draft notices urging them to call Dodd and change his position on
Salvadoran aid.
   During the Reagan administration, Dodd supported a measure
barring economic aid to El Salvador unless the U.S. certified
progress in human rights. He also opposed President Reagan's
certification of the country.
   Dodd, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on
Western Hemisphere affairs, has been a spokesman against aid to the
Contras in Nicaragua. On those and other issues affecting the
region, he has been no darling of the right.
   But his proposal last week to cut military aid and then either
increase it or decrease it depending on the progress of peace
negotiations won no converts among left-leaning groups.
   Dodd says the plan was a logical progression of his long-held
view that Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani, a personal
friend, wants peace and is willing to negotiate with rebel forces.
   The change in Dodd's position is in the amount he is willing to
support.
   If the Salvadoran government broke off negotiations or failed on
the human rights front, the aid would be cut entirely. On the other
hand, if the rebel forces were responsible for breaking
negotiations, full military aid would be restored.
   ``The time has come to frame our assistance in a way that
evidences our firm support for what President Cristiani is trying
to achieve,'' Dodd said. Among other things, he said, ``this
legislation makes it clear that if Cristiani is overthrown or
unconstitutionally removed from power, all assistance will be
terminated.''
   Coming two days after Sens. John Kerry and Edward Kennedy
proposed a complete cut-off of aid, Dodd's proposal pleased
conservative observers.
   ``Dodd is looking at it in a realistic manner,'' said Michael
Wilson, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation.
``He understands the issue a little bit better than some of these
other senators as well.''
   Typifying the reaction from the left was Larry Birns of the
Council on Hemispheric Affairs.
   ``The basic thing about Dodd is he's a straddler,'' Birns said.
``He has lost a lot of credibility in terms of being the serious
student of the region that he has long been believed to be. Within
the community of those who closely monitor U.S.-Latin American
relations, Dodd is looked on as unreliable and inconsistent.''
   Dodd and his liberal critics disagree on a fundamental point:
the impact of military aid. Birns and others argue that military
aid simply provides the tools for right wing death squads to carry
out their terror campaign against peasants, land reformers and
anyone else deemed potentially ``subversive.''
   Dodd argues that military aid prevents violence by convincing
rebels that they cannot take over the country by force and must
negotiate for a political role.
   ``There are those who say `If we cut off aid we cut off the
war.' That is just not a fact,'' said Dodd's top Senate aide, Jason
Isaacson.
   The group whose local chapter was responsible for the ``draft
cards'' being sent to Yale, Rutgers and other schools is pleased
that Dodd has at least abandoned his support for full military aid
to El Salvador.
   ``That he's calling for a cut-off of half the aid indicates that
the policy is in trouble and it indicates that the pressure that
has been put on in his district and around the country has had some
impact,'' said Hugh Byrne, political director of the Committee in
Solidarity With the People of El Salvador.
   Byrne points to the co-sponsors of his proposal _ moderate Sens.
Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., Joe Biden, D-Del., Terry Sanford, D-N.C., and
Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., _ as an indication that he has staked out a
centrist position.
   Isaacson rejected any notion that Dodd formulated his policy
with his critics in mind.
   ``This proposal has to do with what's going on in El Salvador
today and with what's gone on in El Salvador for the last 10
years,'' Isaacson said. ``It has nothing to do with what goes on in
this country.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush, out for a chilly
``power walk'' near his snow-swept vacation home, said he plans to
stay out of former President Reagan's court battle with John
Poindexter.
   Asked if he had talked recently to Reagan, who gave closed
videotape testimony Friday and Saturday in the trial of his former
national security adviser, Bush said ``No, have not talked to him.''
   Bush said he planned to ``stay out of it.'' As to whether he
thought it was good that the former president had testified, Bush
said ``That's a matter between him and the process. ... The process
worked.''
   The Bush administration, however, joined Reagan's defense last
week in supporting his assertion of executive privilege to avoid
turning over diary excerpts sought by Poindexter.
   Poindexter goes on trial March 5 on charges of concealing from
Congress assistance that national security aide Oliver North gave
to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels and lying about a 1985 shipment of
Hawk missiles to Iran.
   Bush, who was Reagan's vice president, consistently has denied
any knowledge of the Iran-Contra dealings.
   Bush arrived in Maine on Friday to spend the holiday weekend
with his wife, Barbara, at their seaside home.
   Skies dawned sunny on Saturday, but a bitter wind blew across
the snow scape.
   Dressed in wool plaid pants and a leather flight jacket against
the icy air, Bush headed off on a vigorous march of about 5 miles
to inspect repairs on his speedboat.
   Although he invited reporters to join him for part of the slushy
walk, Bush was not in a mood to discuss issues.
   ``No questions,'' he called curtly as he and Mrs. Bush set out
from the family compound on Walker's Point.
   Instead he bantered about the ``great day,'' and pointed out his
secret for icy-weather walks _ a cane he called ``one of these
sticks for the non-slide walker.''
   He said he had heard no news of reports that Cuba was to reform
its party structure. However, he said he had spoken to Boston
Cardinal Bernard Law, who was going to meet with church leaders in
Cuba.
   Asked about the four-nation drug summit he attended Thursday in
Colombia, he said reaction has been ``so far pretty good.''
   He jovially shook hands with a few bystanders along the
residential route, but seemed more intent on racing past them to
keep up his breakneck pace.
   ``Careful of this down slope, you guys,'' Bush told the press
pack before dashing off ahead. ``I have to speed up. I hate to go
so slow,'' he said as aides and bodyguards panted along.
   ``Power walk,'' he shouted to reporters, apparently missing
their rejoinders that this form of exercise was the habit of his
former Democratic presidential rival, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis.
   Bush walked to nearby Cape Porpoise where his speedboat Fidelity
is in dry dock for an overhaul.
   Bush proclaimed the job ``beautiful.''
   ``New screws, new engines, everything. It's perfect.''
   Mrs. Bush rode back in one of the security vehicles that
accompanied them on the walk, while Bush was joined by his daughter
Dorothy LeBlond, a Maine resident, for the return hike.
   Bush went the opposite direction for his walk than he did a year
ago when a walk into the town of Kennebunkport resulted in a
chaotic traffic jam of reporters, cameras, townspeople and security
vehicles.
   The Bushes were planning later Saturday to go over remodelling
plans with the interior decorator who will redo some rooms in the
87-year-old stone house on Walker's Point.
   They plan to return to Washington on Monday.

<TEXT>
   Winter winds and waves have broken down
or removed much of the oil left over from last year's cleanup,
Exxon says, but state officials are not so sure.
   ``There's a considerable amount of oil that's not been
removed,'' said Art Weiner, an Alaska Department of Environmental
Conservation official who heads scientific programs for the state's
oil spill team.
   Exxon officials said Friday that some beaches that were black
with oil in September from the March 24 spill from the Exxon Valdez
tanker are now clean, especially those that have taken the most
intense beatings from winter storms. The beaches are in Prince
William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska.
   Even areas that are more protected from the elements are being
cleansed by the harsh weather, they said.
   ``There has been significant removal through time,'' said Andy
Teal, a biologist coordinating Exxon's shoreline monitoring. ``More
than half of what was found in September has disappeared by now,''
he said.
   Exxon said its data reflected surveys conducted from September
through December.
   On Friday, Exxon turned over four months of data from its
monitoring program to the state conservation department and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The company said
the data reflected its best estimate of how much oil from the
nation's worst oil spill remains on the beaches and under the
surface of Prince William Sound and the nearby gulf.
   The Exxon Valdez went aground on Bligh Reef as it was leaving
the oil port of Valdez. It spilled nearly 11 million gallons of
crude into the sound and the gulf.
   Company officials said they hoped the sharing of data with the
federal and state governments would help defuse a ``contentious''
atmosphere that has existed in recent months concerning the effects
of the spill and cleanup.
   ``We don't want to come across as if there's no problem,'' said
Hans Jahns, Exxon's scientific coordinator who is analyzing the
information that 19 scientists have gathered since September. The
studies were conducted at 64 sites throughout the oil spill area,
Jahns said.
   Some beaches remain blackened to varying degrees, he said.
   Jahns disputed recent state figures that as much as 6 million to
7 million gallons of oil remained along the affected area, more
than 1,000 miles of shoreline of Prince William Sound and the Gulf
of Alaska.
   Exxon officials refused to estimate how much cleanup might be
needed this summer, saying they will release their general 1990
cleanup proposal in March.
   State crews surveying the shorelines in the sound and the gulf
would have more information on current oil conditions within 10
days, Weiner said.

<TEXT>
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat promised the
sister of American hostage Terry Anderson on Saturday that he will
do his ``very best'' to help free Anderson and the other 17
Westerners held in Lebanon.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization leader met for an hour
with Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, in the dining room of his
well-guarded mansion overlooking the Mediterranean in the Tunisian
capital, where the PLO has its headquarters.
   They ate lunch while a score of friends and associates looked on
and later discussed what Arafat called the ``tragedy of the
hostages held in Lebanon.''
   ``I am doing my very best to get the hostages released,'' he
told Mrs. Say. ``I shall continue to do this because I consider it
my duty. With the fanatical groups holding them, it is not an easy
task. But I promise you that I will do my utmost.''
   Mrs. Say arrived in Tunis on Friday to appeal to Arafat to use
his influence to obtain freedom for Anderson, the chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press who was kidnapped March 16,
1985 in Beirut. On her European trip, Mrs. Say has been accompanied
by Larry Heinzerling, a deputy director of the AP.
   In Tunis, Mrs. Say also pleaded the cause of the other Western
hostages, who include seven Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman.
   Most of the hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem groups.
   Arafat told Mrs. Say that he had no contact with those holding
the hostages and that the only person who could be expected to help
was President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran.
   ``Even he is blocked for the present because of the power
struggle inside the Iranian leadership,'' Arafat said. ``If
Rafsanjani alone were in power, it would be very easy.''
   Rafsanjani is believed to want to improve Iran's ties to the
West, and this has put him at odds with more hard-line Iranian
politicians.
   Arafat agreed ``with pleasure'' to accept letters to the
hostages carried by Mrs. Say and assured her he would try to relay
them.
   ``You have my sincere gratitude for your efforts,'' Mrs. Say
told the Palestinian leader.
   Mrs. Say's ``humanitarian pilgrimage'' has also taken her to
meet with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar in New
York, Pope John Paul II in Rome, leaders of the European Parliament
in Strasbourg, France and top officials of the International
Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva.
   She is scheduled to continue her trip Monday to Paris to meet
with UNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor, then to Damascus to
confer with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa and later
Canterbury, England to meet with Anglican Archbishop Robert Runcie.
   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, is
believed to hold Anderson and Runcie's special envoy to the Middle
East, Terry Waite, who disappeared while trying to negotiate the
release of the hostages on Jan. 20, 1987.

<TEXT>
   A man with an immaculately kept basement
room furnished with an altar and labeled ``chapel'' has been
charged with possessing thousands of dollars worth of stolen
religious articles.
   Priests from around the area were showing up at the police
station Friday and Saturday following the arrest to reclaim
vestments, chalices, statues and other items.
   William R. Silva, 22, was arrested Friday, the day after police
acting on a tip confiscated hundreds of articles following a search
of the house where he lives with his parents.
   The ``chapel'' was furnished with an altar, church kneelers,
votive candles, flowers, church linens, chalices for Communion wine
and a tabernacle for the storage of Communion wafers, police said.
   A photo album taken by police was filled with pictures of the
altar decorated for Christmas, Pentecost and other religious
holidays. There were pictures of Silva dressed in vestments and
standing at the altar posing as a priest offering Mass.
   There also were color photos of people laid out in coffins, and
newspaper obituary clippings. Silva reportedly had worked at
several funeral parlors. Police said there was no evidence any of
the photos had been taken in Silva's basement ``chapel.''
   Dozens of vestments were confiscated, ranging from brown monks'
robes and plain black cassocks to ornate brocade garments, police
said.
   There also was a crimson skullcap belonging to Bishop Kenneth
Angell, auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Providence, police said.
   Silva may have bought some of the items, or received them as
gifts, police said, but most were believed to have been stolen from
Roman Catholic churches throughout Rhode Island. Their estimated
value was more than $15,000.
   The thefts could date back as far as a decade, said Detective
Capt. Alan B. Leach.
   Silva was released on $25,000 personal recognizance after
arraignment in District Court, Warwick, on Friday.
   A steady stream of priests showed up at the station Friday to
reclaim articles, Leach said. A dispatcher said Saturday that
priests were continuing to show up to identify property.
   A priest from St. Augustine's Church in Providence recovered a
carved wooden statue of St. Joseph worth about $3,000, police said.

   Here is a brief rundown of facts and figures for
Japan's national election Sunday.
   VOTING TIMES: Polling stations are open for 11 hours, closing at
4 a.m. EST Sunday. Most votes will be counted about six hours after
polls close.
   VOTERS: About 90 million people are eligible to vote.
   AT STAKE: Voters cast one vote each in 130 multi-seat
constituencies for 512 seats in Parliament's House of
Representative, or lower house. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party
must win at least 257 seats to retain the right to name the prime
minister.
   CANDIDATES: 953 people, 66 of them women, are running. The
Liberal Democrats are fielding 338; the Socialists 149; the Komeito
(Clean Government Party) 58; the Communists 131; the Social
Democrats 44; the United Social Democratic Party 6; the Progressive
Party 7 and minor parties 64; independents 156.
   OUTGOING LINEUP: The Liberal Democrats, who held 295 seats in
the outgoing lower house, have governed Japan since the party was
formed in 1955. The Socialists, who had 83 seats in the lower
house, are the largest opposition party, followed by the Komeito,
with 54 seats; the Japan Communist Party, with 26 seats, the
Democratic Socialist Party, with 25 seats; the United Social
Democratic Party, with four seats, and eight independents. The
remaining 17 seats were vacant.
   OUTLOOK: Polls predicted the Liberal Democrats would keep their
lower house majority, though with fewer seats. The election was
seen as a test of their popularity against criticism of a sales tax
and of senior politicians' links to the Recruit influence-buying
scandal.
   If the Liberal Democrats lost their majority, opposition parties
were expected to try to form a coalition government, but major
ideological differences between the various opposition groups could
result in a period of political instability.

<TEXT>
   The sticky black goo slopping
onto Southern California beaches from an oil spill is more than an
environmental disaster. It's a conspicuous, election-year issue for
politicians and environmentalists.
   ``This kind of thing motivates to action even people who are not
politically or environmentally active,'' said Bob Hattoy, regional
director of the Sierra Club. ``You've got angry Republican
housewives from Orange County sopping up oil with tea towels. This
will have an effect.''
   The cause of the 400,000-gallon spill Feb. 7 still is under
investigation, but officials speculated the 811-foot American
Trader was struck by one of its anchors while maneuvering into a
mooring area two miles offshore.
   The spill coincided with campaigns for the June primary, when
candidates for governor will be chosen along with many other state
and local offices.
   So many politicians went to the beaches that Mayor Tom Mays
finally asked them for advance notice so they would not interfere
with the cleanup. ``They were bringing their podiums on the beach
and it was a whole show,'' Mays said.
   The interest among lawmakers, however, also is expected to
revitalize efforts aimed at improving oil industry safety,
including proposals for double hulls and double bottoms on tankers,
better traffic control system to guide tankers along the coast,
more tanker safety equipment, and a halt to new offshore oil
drilling.
   The double hull issue probably will be the first settled because
it is currently before a House-Senate committee working on
compromise legislation.
   William Rusnack, vice president of corporate planning for Arco,
said the oil industry was bracing for the worst. ``We always have a
concern there could be an overreaction,'' he said.
   In the first days after the spill, strong Santa Ana winds kept
the oil slick offshore, but a sudden shift in wind direction and
high tides last weekend pushed the oil ashore on Huntington Beach
and Newport Beach.
   Chocolate-brown waves crashed onto beaches caked in black muck
that looked like asphalt and smelled like road tar. From the air,
it looked like a highway had been paved where the water touched the
sand.
   As of Saturday morning, 10 days after the spill, the oil had
killed about 175 birds and coated 370 others in oil. About 1,000
grunion, a small fish, were killed when they came ashore to lay
their eggs, which also were doomed. Halibut fisheries were
devastated, fishermen said.
   Ship traffic was barred at three harbors, hurting fishing boat
charter services, Catalina Island excursion operators and
whale-watching boat operators. Even local fish stores that sold
fish caught far away from the spill lost business from the publicly.
   State officials said things could have been much worse. The
spill will not make the record books in terms of wildlife killed or
dollars lost, and it pales in comparison to Alaska's Valdez spill.
   The cleanup was aided by cooperative weather in the early days,
the geography of the beach, the accessibility of equipment and a
lot of dumb luck.
   Sandbags and booms so far have protected environmentally
sensitive wetlands, and almost no oil drifted south to the tide
pools and the rocky shoreline, which would have been much more
difficult to clean than the sandy beaches of Newport and Huntington.
   Some businesses even benefited from the spill. Restaurants and
shops catered to curious visitors who wouldn't normally be on the
beach in the slow winter season. One shop was selling $12.95
T-shirts that read, ``Crude is Rude, Dude.''

<HEAD>Body of Foreign Minister Recovered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police flew the body of the country's
foreign minister to the capital Saturday but refused to comment on
whether he was murdered after dropping from sight last week.
   ``Only the Police Commissioner (Philip Kilonzo) or his deputy
can comment, and they are not in,'' said an officer at the police
headquarters.
   President Daniel arap Moi announced Friday that the body of
58-year-old Robert Ouko was found four miles from his family home
at Koru. It had been partly burned.
   The president said the body was found ``in circumstances which
indicated foul play'' and vowed ``anyone who may be associated with
this horrible event will most certainly be apprehended.''
   Ouko, considered one of the most articulate and able members of
Moi's Cabinet, disappeared Tuesday, apparently without informing
colleagues or family members of his plans.
   His disappearance went unreported until Thursday evening, when
the offical Kenya News Agency broadcast an appeal from family
members urging him to contact them or government officials.
   Nairobi newspapers Saturday carried lurid reports of the
sighting of the body and its location on a slope, in a bush about a
mile from the nearest road.
   The Daily Nation said Ouko's remains were in ashes. Nearby were
a pair of gum boots, a walking stick, and a sheathed knife.
   Reporters at the scene said police kept them and local residents
about 300 yards away as they loaded Ouko's remains into an air
force helicopter for the journey to Nairobi.
   Ouko's last public appearance was on Feb. 10, when he addressed
a service club in Kisumu, 220 miles northwest of Nairobi and not
far from his home.
   The Kenya Times has reported that a white car arrived at Ouko's
home at about 3 a.m. Tuesday and left with the minister. The
newspaper attributed its report to sentry and a servant.
   Ouko, a father of four girls and three boys, first served as
permanent secretary in the ministry of foregn affairs from 1963 to
1964 and held the same position in the ministry of works up to 1969.
   He later held other high-ranking government jobs before being
tapped by Moi to head the foreign ministry in 1979.

   Antony Michael, a Welsh-born actor
and theater director who had lived and worked in Denmark for 17
years, died of a heart attack at his home in Copenhagen, television
reported Saturday. He was 38.
   The actor left his hometown of Swansea, Wales, in 1973 and
traveled to Denmark, where he started his career by playing mimics.
   As he learned to speak Danish, Michael became popular as a revue
theater actor. In 1989, he was awarded Denmark's top revue theater
prize.
   He was also well known for a series of children's television
programs.
   His death was announced by the TV2 channel during a show that
once featured a comic routine in which Michael portrayed a Turkish
immigrant trying to understand the manners and mores of Denmark.
   Michael married three times and was the father of three children.

<TEXT>
   Christian militiamen struck back Saturday
after a major defeat in Beirut, launching a massive tank-led
assault against a helicopter base held by Gen. Michel Aoun's army
north of the capital.
   Rescuers evacuated 32 bodies _ some mutilated beyond recognition
_ from burned-out cars, tanks, apartments and narrow alleys of east
Beirut's Ein Rummaneh district, taken by Aoun's troops Friday.
   The 18-day-old showdown for control of the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave has left 615 people dead and 1,829 wounded, by
police count.
   Among the latest fatalities was Khalil Dehaineh, 26, a part-time
photographer for the British news agency Reuters.
   Police said Dehaineh was killed by machine-gun fire in the
Shiite Moslem district of Shiyah as he was taking pictures in the
Ein Rummaneh neighborhood. A Shiite militiamen standing next to
Dehaineh also was killed.
   Aoun's gunners and Lebanese Forces militiamen dueled with
mortars in the streets of east Beirut Saturday, starting a dozen
fires in the districts of Ashrafiyeh and Nabaa, the last two
pockets controlled by the Christian militia in the capital.
   ``We are taking a short rest before we start uprooting them from
Ashrafiyeh,'' one of Aoun's soldiers told reporters in Ein Rummaneh
on Beirut's southeastern edge.
   Police said at least 1,000 heavily armed fighters from Samir
Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia were engaged in a three-pronged
attack on the helicopter base at Adma, on the hilltop above the
famous Casino du Liban in Kesrouan province.
   The Lebanese Forces said they had taken control of the base, but
Aoun's command said the garrison shook off the repeated tank
assaults.
   Aoun called a cease-fire throughout the Christian enclave as of
8:30 p.m. in response to repeated pleas by Patriarch Nasrallah
Sfeir, spiritual head of the dominant Maronite Catholic sect.
Geagea's forces accepted the truce and said its fighters had been
ordered to stop shooting on deadline.
   Eleven previous cease-fires have failed to hold.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be named according to
regulations, said Geagea's militiamen launched the attack on the
base at first light. About 500 army commandos have been holding out
against repeated assaults by the militia since the fighting started
Jan. 30.
   He said Geagea's gunners used truck-mounted, multi-barreled
rocket launchers that spit out 40 projectiles a minute to hit the
base, as well as T-54 tanks to try to advance from the north, east
and south.
   The commandos also held the Mediterranean beach that lies below
the base to the west.
   Aoun's gunners outside the area were firing U.S.-made 155mm
howitzers, ``trying to ease the pressure on the helicopter base,''
the police spokesman said. ``He won't be able to keep protecting it
by shellfire.''
   Geagea's gunners were also shelling the Aoun-controlled
mountains on Kesrouan's eastern edge in an apparent effort to
prevent the general from concentrating forces for a ground
offensive to rescue the base, which has 12 of Lebanon's 18
French-made helicopter gunships.
   The remaining six are controlled by the 22,000-strong mainly
Moslem troops loyal to President Elias Hrawi, whom Aoun refuses to
recognize as Lebanon's leader.
   Geagea has recognized Hrawi, who was elected to implement a
peace plan that Aoun opposed on grounds it did not provide for the
withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
   The helicopter base is the only military facility that remains
loyal to Aoun in Kesrouan province, the power base for Geagea's
militia.
   Lebanon's four-plane air force, which had been loyal to Aoun,
took off from its Halat air base in Kesrouan late Friday and
defected to Hrawi's Syrian-backed governmment. They landed at a
base in Syrian-policed north Lebanon, far from Aoun's artillery
range.
   In the Ein Rummaneh neighborhood, scene of Friday's fighting,
glass shards and debris carpeted the narrow alleys. Smoke billowed
from hundreds of gutted apartment buildings.
   Power cables dangled from twisted poles and the wreckage of
burned cars lined both sides of the streets.
   Pieces of furniture, pushed out of blown-up apartments, were
scattered in the streets as water from blasted roof-top tanks
drained underground shelters.
   ``Is this where we used to live?'' asked Mary Hajj, emerging
from an underground shelter.
   Tears on her face, Mrs. Hajj, in her late 60s, kept repeating
the same question. She seemed so stunned that she could not say
anything else.

   A Connecticut man protesting U.S. policies in
Nicaragua was arrested Saturday for allegedly throwing a blood-like
liquid onto a White House gate, police said.
   The arrest took place as an estimated 20 members of the Vietnam
Veterans Against the War chanted `Give Peace a Chance' during a
demonstration in support of the Nicaraguan government and its
elections next Sunday.
   The group also demanded that the U.S.-backed Contra rebels be
disbanded.
   Louis Debenedette, 46, was arrested outside the northeast gate
of the White House after he threw what was believed to be blood
onto the gate during the protest, U.S. Park Police officials said.
   He was charged with vandalism and released on his own
recognizance, U.S. Park Police Lt. Philip Kramer said. The charge
carries a $50 fine.
   Park police and Secret Service officials halted a White House
tour, sealing some tourists inside the gate while the protest took
place.
   None of the protesters got on the White House grounds, Kramer
said.
   President Bush was at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine,
at the time.
   ``We are here protesting today in support of the Nicaragua
elections (and) in support of President (Daniel) Ortega,''
Debenedette, a Vietnam-era veteran, said. ``We believe that the
U.S. is trying to interfere in these elections. Nicaragua and El
Salvador all represent to me the ugliness of this war machine in
this country.''
   A written statement issued by the group said the Contras
``continue to kill, destroy and terrorize.''
   Debenedette currently lives in either Washington or Baltimore,
but is originally from Montville, Conn., officials said.

<TEXT>
   The Defense Department is investigating
allegations that a Connecticut company manufactured a defective
engine part used on some F-16 aircraft, according to documents
obtained by a watchdog agency.
   A Navy memo from Dec. 13, 1989, noted that the Defense Criminal
Investigative Service has ``initiated an investigation into
allegations that gearbox housing assemblies ... are defective,
creating a potentially serious hazard.''
   The investigation centers around allegations about the units
made by the Purdy Corp. of Manchester, Conn., for use in the F-16's
F-100 engine, said the documents released by the Project on
Government Procurement.
   The allegations are that the F-100 gearbox housing assemblies
are being made in such a way that they could vibrate loose when
attached to another part, the documents said.
   But the documents said, ``No problems of this nature have been
reported ... regarding these parts as of this time.''
   Navy spokesman Lt. Frank Thorp said the service does not fly
F-16s with F-100 engines. The memos on Navy stationery were written
as a precautionary measure after the Defense Department's inspector
general was notified of the problem.
   The Air Force flies the F-16s with F-100 engines manufactured by
Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Division, officials said.
   Lt. Don Black, an Air Force spokesman, said he did not know how
many F-100 engines were involved.
   Purdy has been shipping the gear housing assemblies to Kelly Air
Force Base in Texas since December 1988, the documents said.
   Carol Howell, who answered the telephone at Purdy, said no one
at the company was available to talk about the case.

   A regional Communist Party leader on Saturday
denied reports of rioting in Uzbekistan and another top official
said the rumors were aimed at inflaming ethnic tensions in the
neighboring republic of Tadzhikistan.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda warned that ethnic strife
threatens the reforms of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and
thousands of people in Leningrad demonstrated against civil
violence, particularly anti-Semitism.
   Radio Moscow on Friday night reported clashes between members of
the Moslem majority and ethnic Armenians in the ancient Uzbekistan
city of Samarkand. It said army troops had been sent to the city
and a curfew had been imposed.
   It attributed its information to the Interfax news service, a
joint venture affiliated with Radio Moscow.
   But Nasyr Yakubov, the first party secretary of Samarkand, told
The Associated Press by telephone that his city was quiet, there
were no riots and no curfew was imposed. He said the city's 12,000
Armenian residents live in peace with members of other ethnic
groups.
   Interfax later quoted an unidentified high-ranking Interior
Ministry official in Moscow as saying the report amounted to
``provocative information aimed at aggravating the situation in the
region and provoking new national disorders.''
   Radio Moscow said further checks by its correspondents showed
that Samarkand was ``calm and quiet.''
   The city is about 1,700 miles southeast of Moscow and has a
population of 390,000, mostly Moslems. The Armenian refugees are
mainly Christians and had fled ethnic violence in the mostly Moslem
republic of Azerbaijan.
   In the Tadzhik capital of Dushanbe, the army general in charge
of enforcing a state of emergency said that thousands of troops
have helped to stabilize the city after a week of unrest.
   ``I cannot say we have full control over the situation now, but
there are no more outrages like those that took place Feb. 13 and
14,'' Lt. Gen. Georgy Kondratyev said in an interview with the
newspaper Sovietskaya Rossia.
   The violence in Dushanbe, a city of 596,000 people 1,600 miles
southeast of Moscow, was touched off Feb. 10 by rumors that
Armenian refugees were arriving by the thousands and receiving
scarce apartments.
   The official Tass news agency said the death toll in
Tadzhikistan had risen to 22.
   In a front-page editorial, Pravda said increasing civil violence
and confrontations in the far-flung Soviet republics are
endangering Gorbachev's reforms.
   The newspaper said the Soviet Union was at a turning point.
Democracy, it said, must be defended from political extremists on
the right and left.
   ``Democracy should not be left defenseless before the danger of
civil confrontation, chaos and unstability,'' Pravda said.
``Unfortunately, the danger is becoming more and more real.''
   ``The key question of the day is on what ground stabilization
will be achieved,'' it said. ``On the grounds of democracy, with
the help of emerging democratic institutions, on the ground of
national and inter-ethnic accord _ or in accordance with the forced
methods of `tightening the screws' happily used in the past?''
   Perestroika is forging fundamental changes in the Soviet Union,
Pravda said.
   ``We must defend our perestroika as a revolution which is
worthwhile only if it can defend itself,'' Pravda said. ``And we
shall defend it from violence and political platitude, from
ignorance and Philistinism, from unreason and destruction.''

   Strangulation, decapitation, cocaine
dealing, greed and a teen-ager's ghoulish rap song are elements in
a bizarre murder trial that has pitted brother against brother.
   Ruben Deases, just turned 18, is charged with first-degree
murder in the killing of Jennifer Ann Gardner. A brother, Edward
Deases, 21, awaits trial on the same charge. A third brother,
Johnny, 16, is the state's key witness.
   Four youth workers have testified that Ruben bragged about the
May 28 killing after his arrest and even made up rap songs about it.
   One such song included the lines, ``She thought she was cool,
and I was a fool. And now she's dead and I'm ahead,'' said Jack
Leinen, a former youth services worker at the Des Moines detention
center where Ruben was held.
   Ms. Gardner, 20, was the girlfriend of a fourth Deases brother,
Eustaquio, 23, a cocaine dealer who according to defense lawyers
sold $10,000 worth of the drug a week. They shared a one-bedroom
apartment in Ames, a college town north of Des Moines in central
Iowa.
   Called by prosecutors to testify on Friday, Eustaquio lunged
across the defense lawyers' table at Ruben, throwing punches and
snarling curses. Officers had to pull the brothers apart.
   At the time of the death, Edward and Ruben Deases also were
living in the apartment. Johnny, then 15, was visiting for the
weekend from Boys Town, the Nebraska home for troubled youth where
Eustaquio met Ms. Gardner years earlier.
   On the night of May 28, while Eustaquio was out of town, Edward
got into an argument with Ms. Gardner, Johnny testified.
   She was strangled, then decapitated. The next day her head was
found by a jogger in a roadside ditch south of Ames. Ruben and
Edward were arrested June 1, hours before her torso was found in a
lake north of Ames.
   Johnny Deases testified that Edward was jealous of Ms. Gardner's
influence over Eustaquio and that Edward viewed the woman as an
obstacle to his advancement in Eustaquio's cocaine dealing business.
   After quarreling with Edward, Johnny said, she threatened all
three brothers with a 9mm automatic and went into the bedroom.
   Johnny, Ruben and Edward sat in the living room and plotted her
death. Johnny said he was recruited to kill her because of his
legal status as a juvenile, but lost his nerve.
   Ms. Gardner had returned to the living room with a beer and was
sitting on the couch watching MTV, Johnny said, when Ruben moved
behind her and grabbed her throat in a choke hold, lifting her feet
from the floor.
   ``She was struggling,'' the youth said. ``Her legs were moving
and he brought her to the ground in about 45 seconds.''
   ``She was panicking as if she was drowning. Her arms were moving
every which way. ... Her legs were moving every which way ... She
was gasping for air,'' he said.
   Johnny Deases said Ruben choked the woman until she was
unconscious, and Edward then strangled her with a belt while Ruben
held the body down with his foot. Johnny also said he saw Ruben
have sex with the corpse.
   Defense lawyer Stephen Terrill contends Ms. Gardner was killed
by Edward, and that Ruben pleaded with his brother to call an
ambulance. He also got Johnny Deases to admit he earlier had
withheld evidence and lied about what happened on the night of the
killing.
   Chris Cox, a former Iowa State University football player who
shared the rent on a West Des Moines apartment with Eustaquio
Deases, said Edward, Ruben and Johnny Deases showed up at his
apartment in the wee hours of May 29.
   Cox said that while Johnny Deases went to another room, he
freebased cocaine with Edward and Ruben, who wanted to know what to
do with a dead body and whether they could borrow knives, rope and
tape.
   ``It seemed weird,'' Cox said, when Edward and Ruben told him
they had killed Ms. Gardner and left the body in the bathroom of
the apartment.
   The brothers were arrested only after they told another friend
about killing Ms. Gardner and he alerted authorities after hearing
news accounts about the slaying.
   Ruben is scheduled to testify in his own defense. If convicted
of first-degree murder, the brothers face mandatory life prison
sentences, without parole.
   Since the killing, Eustaquio has been arrested and sentenced to
prison on a federal cocaine trafficking conviction.

<TEXT>
   When the Exxon Valdez sailed into icy
Alaskan waters, its crew included a timid helmsman, a second mate
with alleged mental problems and a captain with a history of
drinking, according to testimony at Joseph Hazelwood's criminal
trial.
   As the prosecution ended its second week of evidence and
prepared to wrap up its case, a picture emerged of a cohesive
navigational team strengthened by highly educated and experienced
officers but weakened by the troubled few.
   As the case against Hazelwood unwound, questions were raised
about the skipper's drinking, his knowledge of the crew and his
judgment in leaving the ship's bridge in the hands of others at the
time of a tricky maneuver.
   Did he know that the man holding the ship's wheel, Robert Kagan,
had well-known problems with steering? Did he rely too much on the
veteran third mate, Gregory Cousins? And, once the ship was
grounded, did Hazelwood try a dangerous maneuver to rock it off a
jagged reef?
   The jury must decide whether any of Hazelwood's actions
constituted the reckless behavior with which he is charged.
   The 43-year-old Hazelwood, the only person criminally prosecuted
in the nation's worst oil spill, is charged with second-degree
criminal mischief, a felony, and three misdemeanors _ reckless
endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating a vessel
while intoxicated.
   If convicted on all charges, Hazelwood faces a maximum penalty
of 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   The March 23, 1989, grounding of the 987-foot Exxon Valdez
spilled 10.92 million gallons of oil into the clear waters of
Prince William Sound, killing countless birds, fish and wildlife
and coating hundreds of miles of rocky coast with black goo.
   As crew members formed a virtual parade to the witness stand,
their struggle to maintain loyalty to the captain while testifying
against him was evident.
   Cousins, who was in charge of the ship when it ran aground,
blamed the helmsman, Kagan, for failing to follow orders and steer
hard to the right. ``I think Mr. Kagan didn't really understand the
command,'' said Cousins.
   The third mate credited Hazelwood with being calm and clearly in
command after the disaster.
   Kagan himself conceded under oath that he had become ``timid''
about steering after he was once accused of ``chasing the
compass,'' or oversteering a ship.
   James Kunkel, the chief mate, graduate of prestigious Kings
Point Merchant Marine Academy and a 20-year veteran of the seas,
suggested the skipper knew _ or should have known _ that helmsman
Kagan was the weak link in the ship's chain of operations.
   ``I mentioned I'd sailed with him before and I thought he needed
extra supervision and extra practice in steering,'' Kunkel said,
recalling a conversation he had with Hazelwood. He said Kagan could
not do even the simplest tasks without being watched.
   Once, he said he assigned Kagan to paint a bulkhead, but knew he
would have to keep an eye on him to make sure he used the right
paint and brush.
   Yet Kunkel credited Hazelwood with keeping everyone calm aboard
ship and said he made prudent decisions in the wake of the
grounding.
   The second mate, Lloyd LeCain, said he had assessed Kagan's
capabilities as ``slightly below normal.''
   ``I talked to Capt. Hazelwood about it,'' he testified. ``He
knew he had a problem. He told me to keep an eye on him when he was
steering.''
   But Hazelwood's defense team immediately attacked LeCain's
crediblity, telling the judge that LeCain was on leave from Exxon
for mental problems. They asked that the jury be told that LeCain
had boasted of being a submarine commander in the Falklands, a
Green Beret in Vietnam and a figure in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Defense lawyer Dick Madson said that when Hazelwood left his
ship after the accident, LeCain approached him and said he had two
cyanide pills in case he needed to commit suicide, saying he was
``Ninja trained.''
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone ruled that jurors should not
hear these allegations because they were confusing and constitued
``character evidence'' not permitted under Alaska law.
   And then there was crew member Maureen Jones, who was the
lookout. When the Exxon Valdez grounded she said she saw ``an
aura'' around the bow of the ship which she could not explain. She
described it as ``a greenish glow.''
   For Hazelwood, who has a history of drunken driving convictions
and is accused of intoxication on the fateful night, one fact
mentioned by every crew member was important. They said the captain
seemed sober and in command after the accident and denied smelling
alcohol on his breath. Blood and urine tests taken about 10 hours
after the accident showed alcohol in his system and an investigator
smelled liquor on him.
   ``What was the captain's demeanor?'' Kunkel was asked about the
hours after the grounding.
   ``Very sullen but all business,'' he replied. ``Cool, calm, in
charge.''

<HEAD>Researchers Declare Success in Putting AIDS in Remission</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Drugs are now available that can put AIDS
patients into remission, and recent advances have made clear that a
vaccine to protect against AIDS infection is possible, a panel of
AIDS experts said Saturday.
   At the same time, however, the AIDS epidemic is being followed
by a suddenly resurgent epidemic of tuberculosis, the scientists
said.
   ``We have now made demonstrable first steps in inducing
remission,'' said William Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston.
   ``I think there is evidence that a substantial number of people
who would have died are now alive,'' Haseltine said at the annual
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   He cautioned against a premature conclusion that the AIDS
epidemic may be coming to an end. A number of treatments for AIDS
and AIDS-related infections are available, he said, but many of
them are not available to the poor or to developing countries.
   ``It looks like most of these will be expensive, hard to deliver
and require monitoring,'' Haseltine said.
   ``Unless we develop a vaccine, the future of this epidemic
worldwide will be extremely grim,'' he said.
   A year ago, the prospects for an AIDS vaccine looked doubtful,
said James Mullins of Stanford University. But that has changed.
``There has been a transition in the effort to find a vaccine,''
Mullins said.
   Vaccines to protect animals against AIDS-related viruses have
shown some success, he said, encouraging researchers to believe
that similar vaccines can be found for humans.
   ``There's new hope and interest that a vaccine is possible,''
said John McGowan of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
   Sten Vermund, also of the Allergy Institute, noted that an
epidemic of tuberculosis is emerging in AIDS patients in the inner
cities.
   In New York City, for example, tuberculosis declined between
1960 and 1977, but is now increasing and has reached the 1960 level
again.
   ``We anticipate in our major cities losing two decades of
progress in our tuberculosis control efforts,'' said Vermund. And
unlike the AIDS virus, which cannot be transmitted through casual
contact, tuberculosis is easily transmitted through the air.
   ``I think we should worry about tuberculosis and the risk to the
general population,'' Vermund said.
   Many of the cases of tuberculosis are occurring when individuals
who were exposed to tuberculosis early in life contract AIDS. They
lose the ability to continue suppressing the tuberculosis bacteria,
which normally would have remained dormant, and tuberculosis
appears.
   ``It's likely to be yet another health problem imposed on the
inner cities, where the health problems are already legion,''
Vermund said. There is no strong evidence yet that tuberculosis is
spreading to a significant number of poeple who do not have AIDS,
but that is likely, Vermund said.
   He said the rise in tuberculosis began before the AIDS epidemic,
probably because of the rise in the homeless population during the
1970s. Homeless people are at elevated risk of tuberculosis,
Vermund said.

   Leftist guerrillas said they would free
two American hostages if U.S. diplomats negotiate conditions for
their release, a newspaper reported Saturday. The fate of a third
American hostage was unknown.
   The three men were captured last week when President Bush met in
Colombia with three South American leaders to discuss ways to stop
drug trafficking.
   The Bogota newspaper El Tiempo said relatives of two of the
Americans _ James Donnelly of Detroit and David Kent of
Indianapolis _ had been contacted in Medellin, where they traveled
to gain news about the captives.
   The report said the relatives were assured that Donnelly and
Kent, who were captured either Monday or Tuesday in the drug center
of Medellin, were ``in good health and their lives will be
respected.''
   The paper said the kidnappers demanded that a committee be
formed to discuss the unspecified conditions under which the two
hostages would be freed.
   The report quoted the kidnappers as saying the panel should
include representatives of Antioquia state, of which Medellin is
the capital; the U.S. Embassy in Bogota; the Colombian Human Rights
Comittee; the Red Cross; Colombia's attorney general; and relatives
of Donnelly and Kent.
   The U.S. Embassy in Bogota did not comment immediately on the
report.
   Donnelly, 65, a mechanical engineer, and Kent, 40, a school
teacher, were kidnapped in Medellin in separate attacks by armed
men.
   The third American, the Rev. Francisco Amico Ferrari of
Rochester, N.Y., was kidnapped in Cali on Thursday while the summit
was held in the resort city of Cartagena, 450 miles to the north.
   Although police blamed the leftist guerrillas for the abduction,
no claim of responsibility has been received, and authorities and
Amico's colleagues said no word has been received about his fate.
   The guerrillas, of the pro-Castro National Liberation Front,
issued a statement Friday night claiming responsibility for the
abduction of Donnelly and Kent, which the police had already blamed
on the front.
   The communique, obtained by The Associated Press, said the
rebels kidnapped Donnelly and Kent ``to condemn the U.S.
intervention in Latin America.''
   It said the Bush meeting with the leaders of Bolivia, Peru and
Colombia was part of a plan to impose military control over
Colombian territory.
   The four nations agreed on a joint plan to fight drug
trafficking.
   Since last year, Washington has played a key role in Colombia's
crackdown on the Medellin and Cali drug cartels by extraditing
several top drug traffickers to the United States to face federal
charges.
   Referring to the U.S. invasion of Panama on Dec. 20 that ousted
dictator Manuel Noriega, the guerrilla statement said: ``As it just
happened in Panama, the objective (of the plan) is to impose its
(U.S.) own interests.''
   The statement also criticized to a U.S. proposal to place
American ships off Colombia's shores to interdict drug shipments.
The proposal was put on hold after it was criticized by Colombian
officials.
   The guerrilla communique also criticized the Colombian
government's free-market economic policies and a recently passed
Medellin law taxing citizens to raise funds for the construction of
a subway.
   The leftist insurgency, aimed at establishing a Marxist-Leninist
state in Colombia, began 25 years ago. Authorities say the National
Libertion Front and the Cali and Medellin drug cartels have not
worked together in the past.

<HEAD>Fauntroy Urges Tax Boycott Until District Achieves Statehood</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walter E. Fauntroy, the capital's non-voting
delegate to Congress and a prospective candidate to succeed
embattled Mayor Marion Barry, has again asked his fellow residents
to withhold payment of their federal income taxes until the city is
granted statehood.
   Fauntroy, whose statehood bill lies virtually dormant in
Congress, has promoted the tax disobedience strategy for weeks
without much notice. But the proposal landed him on the front page
of The Washington Post on Saturday, and was sure to raise more than
a few eyebrows at a time when Congress and the administration are
not in the friendliest of moods toward city officials.
   Fauntroy, who said he is ``agonizing'' about running for mayor
in the wake of the perjury and cocaine-possession charges lodged
against Barry, noted at a news conference Friday that people who
fail to file tax returns or withhold their payments could face
fines or imprisonment.
   But ``Those of us who have decided to take this action are
prepared to accept those consequences,'' he said.
   Fauntroy and other statehood advocates have tried several
gambits recently to revive interest in the statehood issue, even as
the city's image is bogged in municipal scandal, a monumental drug
problem and the highest murder rate in the nation.
   One idea has been to post signs at the city's borders which
read: ``Welcome to the Nation's Last Colony. All residents must
leave their rights at the border. D.C. Statehood Now.''
   Another, in Barry's last proposed city budget, calls for the
election of two ``shadow'' senators and a ``shadow'' congressman to
lobby for statehood, though Fauntroy already effectively has that
job in the House.
   Congress in 1978 did pass a constitutional amendment which, if
ratified, would have granted statehood to the city. But only 16
states approved the amendment before the 7-year ratification period
expired. Approval from 38 states is required.
   Fauntroy likened his tax protest to the civil disobedience of
the civil rights movement. He said he would soon establish an
``escrow corporation'' to receive tax payments of fellow
protesters, and hold them until statehood is attained. That
organization, he said, will be called the ``Taxation Without
Representation'' committee.
   Henry B. Holmes, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service,
said that while formation of the escrow corporation would appear to
be legal, taxpayers who diverted their payments could still face
serious penalties.
   Holmes noted that the U.S. courts have consistently ruled that
similar tax protests, such as those against the Vietnam War, did
not obviate criminal or civil liability for non-payment.
   With 650,000 residents, the District of Columbia is more
populous than Alaska, Wyoming, Delaware, Vermont and North Dakota,
while its 68 square miles is less than one-tenth the size of Rhode
Island.
   President Bush has long opposed statehood for the district,
though he favors it for Puerto Rico _ which likely would send
Republicans to Congress. The Democratic Party's national platform
in 1988, meanwhile, singled out the heavily Democratic city for
statehood, a plank won by supporters of the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
Despite that, the Democratic Congress has been less than eager to
press the issue again.
   Jackson, himself a possible contender in the mayor's race, has
acknowledged he might someday like to serve in the Senate, but
denies any personal motivation for his support of D.C. statehood.
   Under limited home rule granted by Congress in 1974, Washington
residents elect their own city government, which levies one of the
highest local income taxes in the nation. But while they
participate in presidential balloting, their only representation in
Congress is the sole non-voting post held by Fauntroy.
   The federal government annually contributes about $500 million
to the city's $3 billion budget. That payment, in theory, is in
lieu of property taxes on federal lands and buildings in the city.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., recently called the federal subsidy a
``very hefty price'' and said that was why he had no use for the
``taxation without representation'' complaint.
   ``I brush aside this quotation, which was revered in 1776, but
believe me, it doesn't apply to the District of Columbia today,''
he said.

<HEAD>Miners Mostly Positive On UMW-Pittston Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CASTLEWOOD, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miners, who vote Monday on the contract
offer that would end their 10{-month-old strike against Pittston
Coal Group Inc., are giving the proposals mixed reviews _ but say
it probably will be accepted.
   ``It's kind of like a marriage. There are some good things and
some bad things, but you've got to take them both,'' John Kirk, a
striking UMW member from Coeburn, Va., said Friday. ``It's a good
contract. I think it'll fly.''
   The strike has idled 1,700 United Mine Workers members in three
states.
   Kirk and the rest of the striking miners got their first look
Friday at Pittston's 49-page proposed contract. The four-year pact
would give Pittston's 1,700 union miners in Virginia, West Virginia
and Kentucky concessions on health care and pension benefits and
the company more flexible work rules.
   If the miners ratify the contract Monday, they could be back at
work before the end of the week, more than two years after the old
contract between the union and Pittston expired, UMW President
Richard Trumka said.
   Trumka drew a round of applause when he displayed the contract
offer while he met Friday with miners at the Russell County
Fairgrounds in southwestern Virginia.
   ``I'm proud,'' Trumka said, choking back tears. ``I'm proud you
did this,'' he said referring to the long strike.
   Pittston's offer is a winner, said Charlie Keen, a veteran miner
from Whitewood, Va., who attended the rally at the fairgrounds.
   ``It's better than I expected,'' Keen said. ``I believe we'll be
back to work next week. There's no doubt in my mind it will be
ratified.''
   ``I think a lot of people are relieved to hear it's a good
contract,'' said Steve Powers, a striking miner from Clintwood, Va.
``Some people are struggling financially.''
   Similar briefings were held for striking miners in West Virginia
and Kentucky.
   UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts had to coax more than 200
members of Local 5737 out of the rain and into an eastern Kentucky
elementary school to hear the contract provisions. The miners were
angered with the pact's lack of provision for taking back 13
strikers accused of picket-related violence.
   ``I've glanced at it enough to know what my vote is, and my vote
is no,'' said Jerry Hurley of Lick Creek, Ky.
   Roberts said the 13 miners were suspended, not fired, and their
work status will be decided by an arbitrator.
   The UMW's strike began April 5. The contract settlement offer
was reached New Year's Eve, but not made public until Friday, while
the UAW tried to get $64 million in fines for illegal strike
activities dismissed.
   Pittston President Michael Odom said the company was delighted
the proposal is going to a vote.
   ``It's a good contract for our employees, good for the company
and good for the communities,'' Odom said in a statement Friday.
``We look forward to going back to work.''
   The UMW is eager ``to get back to doing what we do best, and
that's mine coal,'' Trumka said.
   Wages were not a major issue in the strike, but miners would
receive a cumulative $1.20-an-hour raise at the end of three years.
Top-scale hourly pay in selected positions would be $17.52.
   Pittston won the ability to hire contract truck drivers and
maintenance workers, so long as union miners are not laid off in
the process. And the company would be able to run its mines 24
hours a day, seven days a week, except for Christmas and the Sunday
day shift.
   The UMW won its demand to maintain the 100 percent medical
coverage for employees, pensioners and their families, the same
coverage provided by the 1988 national agreement.
   Pittston agreed to continue participation in the union pension
plan.

   A sometimes unruly crowd weathered
freezing weather Saturday to hail heavyweight boxing champion James
``Buster'' Douglas as its hometown hero.
   Police on horseback had to drive back the crowd which surged
toward Douglas' car in a parade downtown. Police estimated that
25,000 people jammed the parade route, including about 15,000 for a
ceremony at City Hall.
   Douglas' motorcade passed through his old neighborhood earlier.
   One woman was injured when a mounted officer's horse stepped on
her foot during the downtown parade, police said. The parade route
was cut short and Douglas and his manager, John Johnson, arrived at
the City Hall podium from a side street.
   The woman, whose identity was not available, was treated at St.
Ann's Hospital and released, nursing supervisor Rick Ward said. No
other injuries were reported.
   At City Hall, onlookers crowded the streets and watched from
several levels of a high-rise parking garage across the street. The
crowd crossed barriers erected earlier and pressed toward the
reviewing stand. Some people carried posters lauding Douglas and
ridiculing Mike Tyson's promoter, Don King.
   Douglas knocked out Tyson in the 10th round of their title bout
last weekend in Tokyo.
   ``I'd like to thank everybody for coming out today, showing us
support and appreciation,'' Douglas told the crowd. ``And, Columbus
_ make the best of it, baby!
   ``As Mayor (Dana) Rinehart said, I couldn't have done it without
the support of Columbus, my family, the Coach Boxing Team _ I love
you,'' Douglas said. ``It really makes me feel good to see all you
out here today.''
   ``We're just everyday, hard-working, honest, God-loving''
people, Johnson said to scattered ``Amens'' from the crowd. ``The
reason we beat Mike Tyson is because we believe in Jesus Christ.
Mike Tyson is just another man. He was just another man.''
   Rinehart and state Rep. Ray Miller presented proclamations
designating Saturday James ``Buster'' Douglas Day in Ohio and the
city.
   Nine-year-old Clent Dalton said he braved snow flurries and wind
chills of 14 degrees because he watched the fight and wanted to see
Douglas in person.
   ``Tyson had it, and he lost it,'' Clent said. ``I wanted Douglas
to win, because he thought he was so bad at first. I guess there's
always a bigger man, and he was one of them.''
   Earlier Saturday, a 20-car motorcade wound through the
low-income north-side neighborhood where Douglas grew up and
stopped for a ceremony in his honor near the elementary school
where his 11-year-old son, Lamar, is a student.
   ``I sure hope this does a lot to help. This neighborhood is
infested with crack cocaine, and people don't know how to live
right. Maybe this will help,'' said neighborhood resident Calvin
Wilson.
   Douglas was recognized as the heavyweight champion by all three
of boxing's governing bodies after a short-lived dispute over
Tyson's knockdown of Douglas in the eighth round. King claimed
referee Octavio Meyran gave Douglas a long count, allowing him
extra time to get up.

<HEAD>Two Charged With Extorting Money from Family of Missing Girl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The grandfather of a 5-year-old girl missing
since early December reacted with outrage to an alleged attempt by
two men to extract $75,000 in exchange for her promised return.
   ``People who would prey on a tragedy are about as low as the
people who would do it in the first place,'' Larry Pigue said after
the arrest Thursday of two men on federal charges of extortion.
   Pigue is the maternal grandfather of Melissa Brannen, who has
been missing since she attended a Christmas party Dec. 3 at the
apartment complex where she lived in Lorton, Va., a suburb of
Washington.
   Pigue told The Washington Post he and the girl's mother, Tammy,
had doubts that the people who telephoned them Wednesday with the
demand for money were really kidnapers because 10 weeks had elapsed
since Melissa's disappearance.
   ``Your head tells you that it probably isn't true, but your
heart tells you that you hope it is,'' Pigue said.
   The family had contacted the FBI by the time a second call came
Thursday that led to the arrest of Anthony G. McCray, 24, and
Emmett M. Grier III, 20, both of Washington, after arrangements
were made to deliver the ``payoff.''
   On Friday, U.S. Magistrate Jean F. Dwyer ordered McCray held for
10 days pending notification of authorities in Illinois, where
officials said he was on probation. Dwyer placed Grier's bail at
$100,000.
   U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson said the two men did not have
custody of the child ``and there was no indication that they had in
the past.''
   Grier's father, Emmett Grier Jr., said his son had been on the
honor roll at Royal Oak Shrine high school in Detroit, and had won
two scholarships to Howard University.
   ``He said he wanted to take a semester off,'' Grier said. ``I
was very upset but I didn't want to push. My son is basically a
follower. I can't see him conjuring something like this up.''
   McCray has never been a student at Howard, said university
spokesman Alan Hermesch.

   Zulu leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi and his organization Saturday lashed out at the African
National Congress and questioned ANC leader Nelson Mandela's
commitment to black unity.
   Buthelezi and the leadership of his Inkatha movement accused the
ANC of trying to aggravate black political divisions. Their
statements suggested that a bloody feud between the ANC and the
more conservative Inkatha may persist despite the release of
Mandela, who has been widely viewed a possible peacemaker.
   Also Saturday, blacks staged protest marches and rallies in
several cities and towns across the country.
   The central committee of Inkatha adopted a resolution urging
Mandela ``not to be used by factions in the ANC (which) are even
now being destructively divisive when history is calling on all
blacks to unite.''
   Buthelezi, in a separate statement, said he was the target of a
``sordid and sick'' smear campaign by ANC-aligned activists, aimed
at depicting him as the main cause of the 3-year-old conflict in
Natal Province that has claimed more than 2,500 lives.
   Inkatha, which claims 1.5 million members, opposes the ANC's use
of guerrilla violence and its advocacy of militant anti-apartheid
tactics such as economic sanctions and consumer boycotts. The ANC
favors a partly socialist economy, while Inkatha backs capitalism.
   On Friday, Buthelezi became the first black leader to criticize
Mandela publicly since the ANC patriarch was freed Feb. 11 after 27
years in prison.
   Mandela made ``serious errors of judgment'' in suggesting that
police sided with Inkatha in clashes between the group and the ANC,
Buthelezi said. ``He did not even pick up the phone to check my
side of the story.''
   On Saturday, however, Buthelezi directed his criticism at the
ANC, not at Mandela personally.
   Buthelezi said Mandela contacted him after the statement was
issued Friday and added: ``I am entirely at ease and satisfied that
there is still love and respect between us.''
   Buthelezi, chief minister of the tribal homeland of KwaZulu,
said he hoped to meet Mandela when the ANC leader visited Natal.
This trip could take place as soon as next weekend.
   In black protests Saturday, police in the tribal homeland of
Ciskei reportedly fired tear gas over a large area after blocking
protesters from a stadium. A rally was planned at the stadium to
protest the fatal shootings of several blacks by police last week
during celebrations marking Mandela's release.
   In Johannesburg, about 1,000 black postal workers jogged through
downtown, chanting in support of the ANC. They demanded higher
wages and protested government moves to privatize major state-owned
enterprises.
   About 1,000 youths staged a peaceful march in the Cape Province
town of Wellington to demand improved educational and recreational
facilities. In Thokoza, near Johannesburg, several thousand blacks
attended a rally protesting high rents and demanding the mayor's
resignation.
   In another development, a group opposed to mandatory military
service said conscription should be suspended pending an inquiry
into charges that a secret army unit masterminded assassinations of
anti-apartheid activists.
   The statement by the End Conscription Campaign follows
disclosures by police investigators and in news reports about four
former members of a Johannesburg police squad who allegedly joined
a covert army unit assigned to attack anti-government groups. One
of the four is in custody, and arrest warrant have been issued for
the others.

<TEXT>
   Several hundred employees of a
national bank ended a two-day sit-in Saturday to protest plans to
close branches and cut jobs, but workers threatened a strike
involving all five national banks.
   The employees at the National Mortgage Bank began their sit-in
strike Friday and left Saturday afternoon. The secretary-general of
the Bankworkers Association, Juan Zanola, said union members would
strike all five national banks Monday.
   Organized labor, one of Argentina's most powerful institutions,
appeared to be nearing an open break with the Peronist Party
government it helped elect 10 months ago.
   Teachers demanding pay hikes threatened to boycott the start of
classes March 5, and striking clerks who shut down federal courts
one day last week pledged to do so again next week.
   The National Mortgage Bank workers were protesting plans to
close 14 branches and cut 1,200 jobs.
   On Friday, President Carlos Menem said of the striking bank
employees that ``It will go bad for them.'' He insisted he will go
ahead with plans to restructure Argentina's failing,
state-dominated economy.
   ``They may fatten the lines of the unemployed,'' he said of the
strikers.
   Leaders of the 3 million-member General Labor Confederation
sided with the strikers. ``We workers support ... Menem, but we
reject restructuring plans that include layoffs of bankworkers,''
said Guillermo Andreoni, a secretary-general.
   Menem was elected last May and took office in July. His current
confrontation with labor poses dire consequences for his plans to
sell public companies, balance the budget by reducing state
spending, and hold wage increases below price hikes as a way to
curtail inflation.
   The confederation opposes any plan that may reduce jobs and
benefits, and defends workers' demands for more pay. When the
previous government tried similar measures, the group responded
with 13 general strikes.
   The confederation so far has refrained from calling a general
strike even though wages shrank by 50 percent last year, and Menem
seems to have put the needs of business ahead of the demands of
labor.
   Labor is disenchanted with Menem, who pledged during the
campaign to raise wages, increase employment and turn around the
state sector by increasing efficiency rather than selling companies
that were created or nationalized four decades ago by President
Juan Domingo Peron.
   Menem has said he has no choice but to impose austerity
measures. Argentina no longer may borrow abroad because it stopped
repaying its loans. Argentines refuse to lend money to the
government that on Jan. 1 seized bank deposits. Printing money has
led to hyperinflation.
   The showdown with organized labor comes at a time when Menem's
public approval rating has slid to 48 percent, compared to 80
percent four months ago, according to a poll published several days
ago by the respected Socmer agency.
   The national currency lost 28 percent of its value this week
against the dollar, bringing the austral's devaluation to 51
percent since the start of the year, and 99 percent since January
1989.
   Devaluation has fueled inflation that in January soared by 79
percent, and by 4,924 percent in 1989. The cost of living from
February 1989 through last month skyrocketed by 8,164 percent.
   Wages have not kept pace, a dilemma the government sought to
alleviate by setting up soup kitchens, then by handing out food
coupons.
   Neither solved the problem, and fears of social unrest, such as
the food riots of last May, are widespread.

   The legality of the nation's first
hypodermic needle exchange program has been upheld by a state judge.
   Superior Court Judge Robert Peterson said Friday there is only
preliminary proof the program is slowing the spread of AIDS but
added, ``to wait until you get that concrete, specific evidence is
too late.''
   ``We waited a long time,'' said David Purchase, founder of the
1{-year-old program. ``Now we have a clear legal sanction, and we
can go about the business of saving lives.''
   Each week, health workers distribute about 2,000 clean needles
to drug users in return for used ones, to prevent intravenous drug
users who carry the AIDS virus from spreading it to others by
sharing syringes.
   ``We'll obviously keep on going with what we think is a
successful program to combat AIDS,'' said Dr. Al Allen, director of
the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, shared needles
or syringes, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant
women to their offspring.
   Allen filed the lawsuit against the city of Tacoma and Pierce
County last fall to test the legality of the program. The health
department was the first public agency in the nation to sponsor a
needle-exchange project.
   Robert Rohan, the department's lawyer, said the case also was
the first in the nation to test the legality of a needle-exchange
program.
   Although the ruling directly affects Tacoma only, Allen said the
decision could serve as a precedent for similar programs nationwide.
   City Attorney Bill Barker said his staff would meet with the
city manager and City Council next week to decide whether to appeal
the ruling, and whether to pay the city's 50 percent share of the
$45,000-a-year program.
   If the ruling stands, the city could participate ``without being
under the threat of being charged or accused of making an
expenditure on an unlawful or illegal program,'' Barker said.
   The city withheld its share in November after state Attorney
General Ken Eikenberry issued an advisory, non-binding opinion
saying needle exchange programs were illegal under state law.
   The law exempts state, county and municipal officers who
distribute paraphernalia in their lawful duties, and the judge
ruled that health officials are covered by that exemption.

<HEAD>Ukraine Legislators Call for Chernobyl Nuclear Plant to be Closed</HEAD>

   Ukrainian lawmakers said Saturday the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant must be closed and demanded to know why the
issue was not on the agenda of the nation's Supreme Soviet
legislature, the Tass news agency reported.
   Tass said a majority of lawmakers attending the current session
of the republic's Supreme Soviet favored shutting down Chernobyl
because of harmful environmental effects following a fire and
explosion at the plant on April 16, 1986.
   Thirty-one people died and hundreds were hospitalized in the
world's worst atomic accident.
   Ecologists have increasingly said the plant is a danger to the
ecology of the Ukraine, the breadkbasket of the Soviet Union, and
should be closed.
   Tass said deputies opposed to Chernobyl sent a telex to the
national Supreme Soviet, currently in session in Moscow. ``In it,
they ask why the question of the Chernobyl was not included in the
agenda as one of the most vital questions,'' the news agency said.
   The national Ministry of Atomic Energy controls the nuclear
power plant and the national legislature would decide whether it
should be closed.

   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel,
on his way to the United States and Canada, stopped over to meet
Iceland's president Saturday and attend a play he wrote but had
never seen performed.
   The new non-Communist president told a news conference he
decided to visit Reykjavik, Iceland's capital, because the name is
a symbol of peace _ a reference to the U.S.-Soviet summit in 1986.
   Havel talked with reporters before attending a production in
Icelandic of his play ``Slum Clearance.'' Czechoslovakia's former
hard-line Communist government banned Havel's plays for 20 years.
   Havel, his wife, Olga Havlova, and an entourage of about 80
people were scheduled to depart for the United States Sunday for a
three-day visit.
   It will be the official trip to the United States by a
Czechoslovak president, the nation's news agency CTK reported.
   Havel said he and Iceland's president, Vigdis Finnbogadottir,
had common interests, since she is a former director of Reykjavik's
municipal theater. Speaking in Czech, which was translated by a
member of his entourage, Havel said he invited her to visit his
country.
   The Czechoslovak president, who took office Dec. 29 after
Communist leaders resigned, said he did not know whether he would
run for the presidency in June elections.
   ``It does not depend on me,'' he said. ``It depends upon the
various political forces, parties and organizations. All I can do
is either accept or refuse.''
   Also traveling with Havel is Premier Marian Calfa, Finance
Minister Valcav Klaus and Minister of Foreign Trade Andrej Barcak.
Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier and Deputy Premier Vladimir Dlouhy
will join the delegation in Canada, CTK said.

   Michel Drach, a director who along with Jean-Luc
Godard and Francois Truffaut created a new style of filmmaking
known as New Wave, died last week and was buried Saturday. He was
59.
   About 200 people attended the burial at the famed Pere Lachaise
cemetery for Drach, who died of lung cancer Thursday at the
American Hospital in Paris.
   The mourners included Drach's wife, actress Marie-Jose Nat, and
his son, David, as well as Greek director Costa-Gavras and writer
Gilles Perrault, whose novel ``Le Pullover Rouge'' Drach adapted
into a film in 1979.
   Drach made his film debut in 1959 with the well-received ``On
N'Enterre Pas le Dimanche.''
   Working at the same time as Godard, Truffaut and Claude Chabrol,
Drach experimented with the new, freewheeling cinematic styles that
eventually became known as New Wave.
   In 1974, Drach made ``Les Violons du Bal,'' a dark tale based on
the anti-Semitism he experienced as a child during the Nazi
occupation. The 1979 hit ``Le Pullover Rouge'' turned his camera to
crime in Marseille, where he made a strong case against the death
penalty for the killers of a young girl.
   Drach's last film, ``Il Est Genial, Papy,'' in 1987, featured
his friend Guy Bedos, who also attended Saturday's ceremony.
   He is survived by his wife and son.

   Iran's official news agency reported
Saturday that 30 people were arrested in Tehran after they hurled
stones at cars and buildings to protest the postponement of a
soccer game.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the
angry fans had come great distances and waited in line for hours to
see the match Friday. Some of the detainees were released after
interrogation, IRNA said.
   Meanwhile, Iran's main opposition group said in a statement
telexed to The Associated Press that there also were ``bloody''
anti-government protests in the Iranian capital Friday. The
Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, said tens of thousands
of Iranians demonstrated and clashed with security forces.
   The Baghdad-based group said the demonstrations began shortly
after the soccer protest.
   The head of the Tehran soccer board, Hassan Aminbakhsh, said the
matches were postponed because the field had been flooded by heavy
rains and snow the night before.
   Aminbakhsh told IRNA he was present at the stadium Friday and
unsuccessfully tried to switch the games to another stadium.
   He criticized the government-run radio for not carrying IRNA's
anouncement about the postponement hours before the scheduled game
time.

   The Soviet Union will block the reunification
of Germany if the West insists on NATO membership for the combined
states, a top adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said
Saturday.
   Also Saturday, two West German publications said Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher made
concessions to Moscow to win Kremlin support for reunification last
week.
   The Bonn government denied the reports, which said the West
German leaders agreed to seek immediate legal recognition of
Poland's Western border by a united Germany; and promised that East
Germany would continue to supply the Soviets with much-needed food
and farm equipment.
   In an attempt to calm Soviet fears about security, Genscher
Saturday ruled out basing NATO troops on what is now East German
soil.
   ``The West is agreed that with a unification of Germany, there
will not be any eastward extension of NATO,'' Genscher told the
Westdeutsche Rundfunk radio station.
   His comments conflicted to some extent with those of West German
Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, who said Friday that NATO's
military protections should extend ``without weakening'' to all of
Germany in the event of unification. West German officials have
said they have no intention of turning their backs on the Western
alliance.
   The Kremlin made its stance clear Saturday.
   ``If the Western alliance sticks with its demand for a NATO
membership of all of Germany, then there won't be any German
unification,'' Valentin Falin said in an interview with Saarland
state radio.
   Falin, in addition to serving as a Gorbachev adviser, is the
head of the international section of the Soviet Communist Party's
Central Committee. He also is a former Soviet ambassador to West
Germany.
   The Soviet Union has been hardening its stance against NATO
membership for a united Germany, creating an impasse that could
slow the breakneck pace toward reuniting the states split after
World War II.
   Poland's insistence on a role in guiding the process has created
another potential stumbling block. It is concerned about
conservative West German politicans' claims to pre-war German
territories that were awarded to Poland by the Allies after World
War II.
   The Welt am Sonntag newspaper reported that Kohl and Genscher,
when they met with Gorbachev last week, promised to seek full and
immediate legal recognition of Poland's Western border by a unified
Germany.
   A Bonn government spokeswoman denied Saturday that such a
promise was made but added that ``it is possible this issue was
discussed.''
   Welt am Sonntag and the influential Der Spiegel magazine of
Hamburg said Kohl and Genscher also guaranteed to the Moscow
leadership that East Germany's contractual obligations to deliver
various products to the Soviet Union would be upheld after
reunification.
   Welt am Sonntag said the products were mainly food and farm
equipment. The Soviet Union is heavily dependent on East Germany
for such agricultural products.
   The spokeswoman denied that such an agreement was reached in
Moscow but added: ``These issues can only be settled after the
joining of the two German states.''
   Der Spiegel appears on the newsstands on Monday and Welt am
Sonntag is a Sunday newspaper. Both provided their reports to other
news media in advance of publication.
   West Germany has sought to quicken the pace of unification,
prompting East German protests that Bonn has been heavy-handed in
its dealings with its troubled neighbor.
   For weeks, there have been assertions that the troubled East
German economy could soon collapse.
   East Germany has been hurt by the exodus of about 2,000
emigrants a day this year, joining the more than 340,000 who left
last year. Many of them are young, skilled workers.
   In the financial capital of Frankfurt, West German Economics
Minister Helmut Haussmann criticized East German Premier Hans
Modrow's rejection of quick introduction of the West German mark in
East Germany.
   ``Heading back home with the West German mark in your luggage is
one of the greatest gifts there is,'' Haussmann said, referring to
Modrow's trip to Bonn earlier in the week.
   ``A free market-oriented country like Hungary would know how to
appreciate such an offer,'' Haussmann added.
   East Germans have said they realize that unification is
inevitable, and they have been making plans to join the two
countries and the city of Berlin.
   That includes East German plans to tear down a 1.2-mile stretch
of the Berlin Wall between the Reichstag, the former Parliament
building, and the famous Checkpoint Charlie crossing.
   The West Berlin city government said the East Germans will put
up a 5-foot fence along most of the stretch, but leave open a
200-yard section near the Brandenburg Gate. The work is to start on
Monday.
   East Germany's Communist leaders began opening the wall last
Nov. 9 in response to the exodus of East Germans and the growing
street rallies demanding democratic reforms.
   A group of about 1,000 West Germans held their own street rally
in Frankfurt Saturday and clashed with police in a demonstation
against an extreme rightist party.
   Several police officers and 27 demonstrators were injured in the
clashes. Police said the demonstrators threw rocks, bottles and
fireworks. The protesters demanded that the ultra-rightist National
Democratic Party be outlawed.

   The Communist Party on Saturday
expelled former President Gustav Husak, former Premier Lubomir
Strougal and other members it said had given communism a bad name.
   The action came four months before the party, which in December
gave up its monopoly on power, is to compete in free elections.
   In addition to Husak and Strougal, 18 other former officials
were expelled, including five who were on the party's ruling
Politburo until recently.
   ``With their activity, they contributed to a situation where the
ideas of socialism are quite discredited in a considerable part of
the population,'' said a party announcement quoted by the
government news agency CTK.
   The expulsions were proposed by a commission looking into the
political responsibility of former senior party officials ``for the
crisis development'' in the past. They were announced following a
party Central Committee meeting chaired by current party chief
Ladislav Adamec.
   Adamec told the session that ``20 to 30 percent'' of the party's
1.7 million members had left its ranks since Nov. 17, 1989, the
start of the peaceful revolution that removed the Communists from
power.
   The Communist Party lost its control of the goverment and its
majority in Parliament following the revolution. It also has lost
credibility and prestige among the people and is expected to face a
tough campaign in free elections tentatively scheduled for June 8.
   Husak became party chief in 1969 following the Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968.
   He was replaced as head of the party by Milos Jakes in December
1987 but continued as president of Czechoslovakia, a post he lost
during the revolution to playwright Vaclav Havel, once the nation's
leading dissident.
   Strougal resigned as premier on Oct. 11, 1988, following party
criticism of his work.
   The party suspended the memberships of Husak, Strougal and 30
other former party officials in December.

   A 17-year-old girl who was caught in
an avalanche Saturday was found alive after being buried under
three feet of snow for nearly two hours, authorities said.
   Carrie Hamilton, a drill team member from Mater Dei High School
in Santa Ana, was treated for minor frostbite to her toes, said
sheriff's Deputy Ronald Card.
   ``She's a lucky girl,'' he said.
   Miss Hamilton was among 98 people on an excursion to the Ester
Christian Conference Center in the Angeles National Forest, 45
miles northeast of Los Angeles, said Mike Corrigan, leader of the
outing.
   The avalanche apparently was touched off by 10 students who
hiked without permission up a hill covered in 1{ feet of snow, said
Corrigan.
   Miss Hamilton, who was at the bottom of the hill, was buried,
but managed to clear a small breathing space in the snow. The other
hikers were tossed around by the snow, but were unhurt, said Card.
   She was rescued by members of the National Ski Patrol and a
sheriff's search team.

   A Sea Lance anti-submarine missile was
successfully launched for the first time in a test Saturday at the
White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, Boeing Aerospace &amp;
Electronics announced.
   Boeing is testing the missile although the Navy has cancelled
its $380 million contract the Sea Lance.
   The 20-foot-long missile was launched from a ground pad and made
a long-range flight to its target, the company said in a news
release.
   Boeing spokesman Milt Furness said Boeing was required to build
and test the two missiles under its contract with the Naval Sea
Systems Command, which expires in September. Before money for the
missile was eliminated from the 1991 defense budget, Boeing was to
develop and build 50 missiles for testing.
   Sea Lance is designed to be launched from either submarines or
ships. After flying to the vicinity of an enemy submarine, the
missile would release a torpedo which would float by parachute to
the ocean's surface and then hunt down the sub.

   Israeli soldiers backed by helicopters raided a
West Bank village and tracked down Palestinian fugitives in nearby
caves, arresting more than 100 suspected uprising activists, the
army and state radio said Saturday.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, a 22-year-old Palestinian woman was
stabbed and beaten to death Saturday morning by fellow Palestinians
who accused her of helping Israeli authorities, Arab reports said.
   The woman, Ishanhaz Timraz, was murdered on the main street in
the Gaza town of Rafah when she went to a U.N. relief office to get
food supplies, Palestinian journalists and hospital officials said.
   The military command confirmed the death and said it was under
investigation.
   The killing brought to 186 the number of Arabs slain by fellow
Palestinians as suspected pro-Israeli collaborators in the 26-month
uprising against Israeli rule in Gaza and the West Bank.
   At least 656 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or
civilians, and 43 Israelis have died.
   Also in Gaza, Israeli troops shot and wounded at least six
Palestinians in a number of stone-throwing clashes, Arab hospital
officials said. The army said it knew of three Palestinians who
suffered light injuries.
   The military command said soldiers raided the village of Yamun
in the northern part of the occupied West Bank over the weekend. It
did not say when exactly the raid took place.
   The soldiers, backed by air force helicopters, arrested some 90
Palestinians suspected of guerrilla activities and participation in
violent protests, the army said. It said instigative material and
weapons such as axes, knives and sticks were found in the village.
   Israel radio said some Palestinians were captured in caves near
the village, where they had fled. The radio said another 20
Palestinians were arrested for not paying taxes, a major uprising
protest tactic.
   It quoted an unidentified army commander of the area as saying
no shots were fired during the operation.
   In another development, Israeli authorities expelled from the
country a Yugoslav woman suspected of spying for the PLO, the radio
reported. Patricia Kansevitz, 26, was sent to Zagreb, Yugoslavia on
Friday.
   Kansevitz was arrested by Israeli security officials on Jan. 7
along with another Yugoslav woman, Victoria David, 34. David, a
convert to Judaism who immigrated to Israel in 1987, was charged on
Jan. 28 with contact with a foreign agent, membership in an illegal
organization and passing information to the enemy.
   The charge sheet alleged that she took photographs of military
installations and strategic sites.
   According to the charge sheet, David went by the code name of
``Halila'' and was recruited in Yugoslavia into Fatah, the
Palestine Liberation Organization's mainstream branch headed by
Yasser Arafat.
   Kansevitz reportedly acted as a courier who transferred the
information to the PLO.
   The case was under a court-imposed news blackout lifted on Jan.
23 when the Hebrew daily Haaretz published the story on its front
page.

   The metal rings that bulls wear in
their noses have taken on new appeal for humans.
   Collectors and decorators now covet the rings, said Sandi
Mauldin, owner of the Antique Corner in this central Illinois town.
``It's one of the things we sell anytime we can get one,'' she said.
   The nose rings are brass, bronze or stainless steel, giving them
lasting value. Usually 2 to 3 inches in diamater, they are inserted
in the flesh between the nostrils when the bull is about 1 year
old. Cattle owners have long used the rings in the sensitive noses
to control ornery bulls.
   ``About the only one who ever removes a ring from a bull is the
butcher, my farmer friend says,'' said Mauldin in a recent
interview.
   She has bought the rings at auctions for $2 or so. The rings
sell at her shop for as much as $5.
   ``I've found them in a box of tools at auctions, and I've had
people bring them in, wondering if I had a use for the rings,'' she
said. ``I want those that are used. I wouldn't have any use for a
new one.''
   People who decorate with country items use the bull rings as
wall decorations, according to Mauldin.
   ``The pure country enthusiast would not polish the ring. They
don't want it to shine or look new,'' she said.
   Nostalgia also is a selling point, especially for customers who
grew up on farms. ``They exclaim, `I know what this is!','' Mauldin
said.

   Elvis Presley impersonator Don Wright is in the
spotlight of a lawsuit.
   The 43-year-old Wright of Akron appeared in Cuyahoga County
court, dressed in black, his shirt opened nearly to his waist, and
his black hair swept back in the best Elvis style. Speaking in an
Elvis sound-alike voice, Wright testified at a hearing Friday.
   At issue: whether Wright copied his program, in which he invites
bar patrons to take the stage and sing to professionally recorded
music, from a former employer.
   Judge Richard J. McMonagle refused to issue a temporary
restraining order to stop Wright from conducting the shows. He
scheduled a hearing on the case in about two weeks.
   ``We're not telling him he can't be Elvis,'' said lawyer Thomas
S. Hudson, representing Center Stage Entertainment of Parma
Heights, which brought the action against Wright.
   ``The only person who has a claim against that would be Elvis,
and I don't know if he's in the building,'' McMonagle said.
   Hudson said Wright was hired by Center Stage as the host of
audience participation programs. The plaintiff said Wright engaged
in unfair competition by continuing to stage the programs under the
name ``Stars of the Bars.''
   Company owners said he used similar advertising and the
identical musical library, which the company says he copied.
Wright's lawyer, Teddy Sliwinski, said his client helped create the
bar concept.

   The interim government on Saturday
named a defense minister backed by reformist officers, who demanded
the resignation of the previous chief for failing to purge
commanders from the Ceausescu regime.
   Lt. Gen. Victor Anastase Stanculescu, who was the interim
government's economic minister, was the choice of hundreds of army
and air force officers who had demonstrated since Monday in front
of government headquarters.
   Former Defense Minister Nicolae Militaru handed in his letter of
resignation Friday morning, said government spokesman Dan
Radulescu. He did not disclose the contents of the letter, but said
``Militaru clearly realized he had to step aside, when faced with
such massive opposition.''
   Saturday afternoon, the army's general staff discussed the
events of the past week and the internal reorganization demanded by
the officers.
   The officers criticized Militaru for not replacing many top
officers after December's revolution that toppled Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Stanculescu, who had been a first deputy defense minister under
Ceausescu, told reporters he agreed with the purge.
   ``The Securitate as a body no longer exists,'' he said,
referring to the disbanded secret police. ``But there needs to be
an investigation and punishment of those who were compromised (in
the army).''
   At Stanculescu's installation ceremony, interim President Ion
Iliescu said Stanculescu was ``professionally and intellectually
qualified'' to ``lead the process of ... improving the army on all
levels.''
   Iliescu told about 200 military officers assembled in the hall
of the Grand National Assembly that Militaru ``did not succeed in
establishing a real communication with the army's command,
aggravating the situation in the army to a point at which it became
a source of tension for all of society.''
   Stanculescu promised to ``collaborate with all the army's
commanders.''
   ``We will present our conclusions in consensus,'' he said. The
officers present responded with loud applause.
   On Thursday night, state-run television broadcast a frank but
edited tape of talks between Deputy Prime Minister Gelu Voican
Voiculescu and 58 officers from 38 units who presented a list of 13
demands including Militaru's resignation.
   The 21-member Executive Bureau of the ruling Council of National
Unity Friday approved the creation of a commission to investigate
all the officers' demands and expressed hope that the measures
taken by the government would calm the situation in the country.
   But Saturday afternoon, about 200 civilians demonstrated outside
government headquarters against Iliescu.
   Demonstrators claimed that he ``controls three-quarters of the
Council of National Unity,'' which is ruling the nation until
elections scheduled for May 20.
   Iliescu's National Salvation Front led the country for six weeks
after the revolution and is now one of 37 parties that will compete
in the elections.

<HEAD>Snow Blankets Much of Nation; Rain Remains in South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow blanketed much of the nation from New England to the
Pacific Northwest on Saturday, and rain continued to pose a threat
in the West and South where torrents had caused flooding.
   Snow was scattered in northern New England, New York state,
northern and western Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan,
Montana, western Wyoming, northern and western Utah, eastern
Nevada, and the mountains of northern California, Oregon and
Washington.
   Rain fell in the lower elevations of western California, and
from southeast Louisiana across northern Florida and the Texas Gulf
Coast.
   A winter storm warning remained in effect for interior parts of
western Washington state, where up to 12 inches of snow fell
between Whidbey Island and Olympia. Strong winds brought the wind
chills to near zero in many locations.
   Rain continued in Los Angeles and Orange counties.
   Wind advisories were posted in southern Nevada and the deserts
of Southern California, while a winter storm watch was posted for
Saturday night for parts of Utah.
   Advisories for blowing and drifting snow were posted in much of
Minnesota, eastern North Dakota, and across South Dakota except the
state's extreme eastern and western parts.
   Winds gusting to 40 and 45 mph moved snow around north-central
Nebraska and caused hazardous driving conditions.
   Yellowstone Park in Wyoming had as much as 3 inches of snow
overnight, and there were greater amounts of snow in the higher
mountains nearby. Gusts reached about 50 mph near Casper Mountain.
   In Colorado, winds gusted to more than 50 mph at Elbert, and to
near 80 mph at Telluride ski resort. Ski lifts at Telluride and
Snowmass ski resorts were closed by the winds.
   Duluth, Minn., broke its low temperature record for the date,
plummeting 27 degrees below zero. The previous record: 21 degrees
below zero, set in 1958. The normal low temperature for the date in
Duluth is 3 degrees.
   The nation's low Saturday morning was 28 degrees below zero at
Hibbing, Minn.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 7 degrees
below zero at Cutbank, Mont., to 84 degrees in Bartow, Fort Myers
and Orlando, all in Florida.

   LOS ANGELES _ (AP) _ Former President Reagan spent a second day
in court Saturday, testifying about the Iran-Contra affair that
mired the final two years of his presidency.
   Reagan, flanked by Secret Service agents, emerged from a federal
courtroom at 2:10 p.m. and headed down a back stairwell after
completing approximately eight hours of videotaped testimony over
two days.
   Reagan, who had entered the downtown federal courthouse smiling
and waving earlier in the day, smiled broadly as his limousine
pulled out of the courthouse parking garage. As he has before,
Reagan ignored reporters' questions.
   Reagan testified before U.S. District Judge Harold Greene in
connection with the trial of his former national security adviser,
John Poindexter.
   Poindexter is accused of concealing his former aide Oliver
North's assistance to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels and lying about
a 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   Poindexter declined comment as he climbed into a taxi after the
session, but answered ``no'' when asked if he would be returning to
the courthouse for more testimony.
   ``Testimony is finished. That's all I can tell you,'' said his
lawyer, Richard Beckler.
   Later, Reagan's spokesman, Mark Weinberg, issued a news release
saying the former president had cooperated and hadn't asserted
executive privilege.
   ``Since he first learned of the Iran-Contra matter and
immediately told the American people about it, President Reagan has
cooperated fully with all of the attendant investigative and
judicial proceedings,'' the statement read.
   ``President Reagan testified fully and completely in response to
questions posed by counsel for Adm. Poindexter and the Iran-Contra
independent counsel. President Reagan agreed to the videotaped
deposition and did not assert executive privilege,'' the statement
concluded.
   Reagan was allowed to give his videotaped depositions at a
courtroom near his Bel-Air area home, rather than in Washington,
where the proceedings against Poindexter are to begin March 5.
   Security was especially rigorous for the extraordinary two-day
session. Federal marshals and Secret Service agents kept the media
some 40 feet away from Reagan as he entered and left the courtroom
Friday. Reporters were allowed only a bit closer Saturday.
   Although the deposition-taking was closed to the public, Greene
said the videotapes would be released within a few days after
editing of issues deemed to involve national security.
   Over the two days, the former president answered 154 questions
about his role in the Iran-Contra affair, the failed
arms-for-hostages deal during Reagan's second term.
   The questions were drawn from 183 submitted to the court by
Beckler, who was allowed follow-up questions if necessary. However,
the judge prohibited Poindexter's attorney from raising additional
questions on new subjects.
   ``I think he was very fair in his testimony,'' Beckler said.
   Poindexter sought the testimony to bolster his contention that
his secret activities had been authorized by Reagan.
   Although the judge hasn't made the specific questions public, he
said they fell into several broad categories, such as the extent of
Reagan's knowledge of the shipment of missiles to Iran and Reagan's
understanding of legislation that temporarily barred U.S. aid to
the Contras.
   Reagan said early in 1987 that he hadn't known about ``secret
bank accounts and diverted funds,'' two products of the Iran-Contra
affair that he said he found ``personally distasteful.'' He told
the Tower Commission, which was appointed to investigate the
affair, he didn't know National Security Council staffers were
assisting the Contras.
   Poindexter later told Congress he believed Reagan understood
that ``Col. North was instrumental in keeping the Contras supported
without maybe understanding the details of exactly what he was
doing.''

<HEAD>Soviet Group Asks U.S. Government to Protect Crane Habitat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEARNEY, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet environmental group has asked the
U.S. government to protect the habitat for sandhill cranes when it
considers relicensing the Kingsley Dam on Nebraska's Platte River.
   Alexander Mischenko, deputy chairman of the Soviet Association
for Ecology and Peace, said in a letter to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission that the Platte River habitat is a primary
staging area for the cranes. About 10 percent of them nest in
Siberia following their spring migration from the United States.
   The Soviet made their appeal at the urging of the U.S. chapter
of Friends of the Earth.
   Brent Blackwelder, vice president for policy for Friends of the
Earth, called the Soviet move unprecedented and a sign of the
growing recognition that environmental issues often transcend
political boundaries.
   U.S. environmental groups have urged Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to place conditions on the long-term licenses sought by
Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District and the
Nebraska Public Power District to operate the dam, two other power
plants and a steam plant.
   Applications for those licenses will be submitted May 5.
   The environmentalists say the dam has held back too much water
from the Platte River, threatening the habitat of 300 species of
migratory birds, including six endangered species, and the sandhill
cranes.
   The long-term licenses for the districts expired in 1987 and
they have operated on annual licenses since then. On Wednesday, the
federal commission placed conditions on Nebraska Public Power
District's interim license concerning habitat development and flows
in the Platte River.
   ``At first I thought when I heard it (Soviet intervention in the
relicensing) that it was a joke,'' said Frank Dragoun, manager of
the power and irrigation district.
   He said that although sandhill cranes aren't hunted in Nebraska,
they are hunted legally in eight or nine other states, with 14,000
to 16,000 killed annually.
   Power district spokesman Wayne Jacobsen said the Soviets's
intervention in the relicensing issue ``looks like it might make an
interesting legal problem for somebody to straighten out.''
   Ken Strom, manager of the National Audubon Society's sanctuary
along the Platte River between Kearney and Gibbon, said the
international interest in the river shouldn't come as a surprise.
   ``We and anyone involved in habitat on the river realize it's
not just a Nebraska resource, but a national and international
resource,'' he said.
   Sandhill and whooping cranes that rest and feed along the river
each spring often begin their migratory flights in South America
and Mexico, Strom said, and continue north to Canada and Siberia.
   More than 500,000 cranes stop along the shallow river in
Nebraska each spring to feed and gain strength for the flight
north. The cranes roost along the river's sandbars to keep safe
from predators.

<HEAD>Fire At Tire Dump Near Lake Erie Burns For Sixth Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAGERSVILLE, Ont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blaze at a huge tire dump near Lake
Erie defied firefighters for a sixth day Saturday, spewing smoke
that forced 600 nearby residents from their homes.
   The fire at Tyre King Recycling, which contains between 12
million and 14 million tires, broke out Monday and investigators
have blamed arson.
   Ontario officials said there was no health hazard outside the
2{-mile evacuation area surrounding the blaze, 12 miles north of
Lake Erie and 60 miles north of Erie, Ohio, which lies across the
lake.
   About 40 firefighters were working to bring the blaze under
control. Some environmental experts say it could burn for months
because of the number of tires.
   Environment Minister Jim Bradley said Friday that Ontario
taxpayers may end up paying an estimated $1 million to clean up
after the fire if the owner is unable to pay.
   The Environment Ministry declared Tyre King, Ontario's largest
tire dump, an illegal waste site in December 1985. Since then the
owner, Edward Straza, has not applied for a certificate of approval
to operate the dump, according to a news report.
   Four thousand people, including many of Hagersville's 2,500
residents, were urged to leave their homes but records showed only
about 600 had left.
   Preliminary air samples showed levels of cancer-causing benzenes
but not at levels much higher than in major urban areas, chemist
Akos Szakolcai of the Environment Ministry said Friday.

   A freight train derailed near this small
town Saturday morning, sparking a huge fireball and forcing the
evacuation of several families living nearby, authorities said.
   Nobody was reported injured in the accident shortly before 8:30
a.m., said Mike Cox, spokesman for the state Department of Public
Safety. He said the derailment of 24 cars caused ``quite an
explosion.'' The cause wasn't immediately known.
   The train was reported carrying liquid propane and other
hazardous materials, Cox said. He said there was a possibility some
of the material would leak into a creek, but other authorities
discounted the possibility.
   Fearing further explosions, firefighters decided ot allow the
fire to burn itself out.
   Doug Fogg, Corsicana Police Department's assistant fire chief,
said it was common practice to allow derailment fires to extinguish
themselves.
   The three crewmembers, who weren't identified, were given drug
tests, a standard procedure following train accidents.
   Curtis Rash, mayor of this town of 200 about 45 miles south of
Dallas, said he was about two miles away when the blast occurred.
   ``It looked like napalm going off,'' he said. ``It was a ball of
fire about 100 feet in diameter. It rose up in the air about 100
feet or so.''
   The wreckage continued burning past noon, and huge black plumes
of smoke could be seen for 15 miles. Reporters and other
non-residents were being kept out of the area.
   The 44-car train, bound for Houston from Tulsa, Okla., lost its
last 24 cars on a curve, said John Grundmann, superintendent of
operations for Fort Worth-based Burlington Northern, which owns the
train.
   A commercial clean-up team from nearby Corsicana arrived shortly
before noon to begin removing the wreckage. The Texas Railroad
Commission and state Water Commission dispatched investigators to
the derailment.
   Fear of more explosions kept five public safety department teams
from approaching the site and forced evacuations of fewer than a
dozen families in a rural section of Emhouse. The evacuation area
was scaled back later in the day and all but three or four families
were allowed to return.
   Cox said the authorities at the site believed some of the
hazardous liquids were leaking into Chambers Creek, which feeds
feeds Lake Corsicana and the Richland Creek Reservoir, which
supplies water to many Navarro County residents.
   But Rash said the creek is about 400 yards from the accident
scene, and said he doesn't believe the leaking materials would be
able to reach the water. And Charles Gazda, chief of the emergency
branch of the Environmental Protection Agency in Dallas, said as
far as he knew nothing spilled in the creek that would cause any
significant problem.
   The mayor said that despite the mammoth fireball, the explosion
wasn't extraordinarily loud.
   ``When we went around to evacuate those who lived nearest there,
thy were still sleeping,'' he said. ``They didn't even wake up.''
   The nearest residents were about a quarter-mile from the
derailment scene.

<HEAD>Carter Says He Tried To Negotiate With Noriega To Step Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Carter revealed Saturday
that he tried to persuade Panamanian ruler Manuel Noriega to step
down after that country's May presidential election, which was
widely considered fraudulent.
   Carter, who served as an unofficial election observer, tried to
negotiate with Noriega on May 8, a day after the election, said
Robert Pastor, who was Carter's national security adviser on Latin
America from 1977 to 1981.
   ``I negotiated with Noriega through an intermediary all through
that day, and I tried to convince him (Noriega) could be a hero,
that all of his problems would be over,'' Carter told the Peace
Prize Forum at Augsburg College.
   ``I had the authority _ this is the first time I've ever said
this publicly _ to tell Noriega, `You can stay on as commander in
chief until September (1989), when the new president takes over.
You will not be extradited to the United States. You can stay in
Panama if you wish, after you step down as commander in chief.'''
Carter recalled.
   ``I think he considered this very carefully. About 2 o'clock
Monday afternoon (May 8), it became apparent to me that Noriega
decided to steal the election. He refused to communicate with me
any more,'' Carter said.
   Carter left Saturday's conference, which was attended by an
estimated 3,400 college students and others, without saying who had
given him the authority to negotiate with Noriega.
   Noriega, who held ultimate power in Panama as military
commander, is accused of trying to steal the election for his
hand-picked candidate. International observers said the opposition
really won by a 3-1 margin, but Noriega annulled the results.
   Noriega surrendered to the United States after this country's
invasion of Panama last year and is in custody in Miami awaiting
trial on drug-trafficking charges.
   Pastor, reached Saturday night at his home in Georgia, declined
to say who gave Carter permission to negotiate with Noriega.
   ``I think I would like to leave it as saying he consulted with
senior levels of the U.S. government,'' said Pastor, an Emory
University professor and director of the Latin American program at
the Carter Center at Emory.
   Through tabulations made by the Roman Catholic Church, Pastor
said he and Carter determined early the day after the election that
the opposition had beaten Noriega's candidate. He and Carter tried
to contact several senior military officials and subsequently
Noriega to arrange a meeting, Pastor said.
   In the meantime, Carter met with the opposition leadership,
current Panamanian President Guillermo Endara and vice presidents
Ricardo Arias and Guillermo Ford.
   ``They encouraged Carter to get directly in touch with Noriega
to try to arrange a peaceful transition,'' Pastor said. ``We later
learned that Noriega had gotten the message and was just too afraid
to meet with Carter.''
   After Noriega failed to respond, Carter's staff informed him
they would give him an hour to do so before Carter would hold a 7
p.m. news conference to denounce the election as a fraud, Pastor
said.

<HEAD>Federal Experiment Will Deny Job Training for Poor, Paper Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal welfare experiment would deny some job
training opportunities to about 10,000 poor people in 10 states to
see how well they do without them, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   Texas welfare officials have questioned the ethics of the
experiment and refused to participate, according to The Dallas
Morning News.
   The experiment is intended to evaluate the Job Opportunities and
Basic Skill training program, which requires some people on welfare
to apply either for education or training programs or lose benefits.
   The experiment would reject some people who normally would have
received training _ forming a control group _ and compare their
experience over several years with those who participate in the
program.
   Government officials say this kind of experiment is the only way
to determine if the training programs will work _ even if it means
some people are denied job training opportunities.
   Federal officials hope to have 10 states participate in the
experiment. Arkansas, California and Oklahoma have expressed an
interest.
   But some state officials, including those in Texas, are
uncomfortable with the ethical dilemma of randomly forcing some
people out of potentially helpful programs in the name of science,
the paper said.
   ``We told them we would not take part,'' said Claudia Langguth,
deputy commissioner for the client self-support services division
of the Texas Department of Human Services. ``My staff told me it
would require a very large control group of several thousand
people.''
   Federal officials have focused new attention to the ethics of
welfare experiments. On Feb. 12, U.S. Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan killed a federal study that would have
denied about 800 Texans access to extended medical coverage and
child care.
   Officials also told Ohio that a similar study of new Medicaid
benefits in that state would likely be canceled, the paper said.
   Martin Gerry, assistant secretary for planning and evaluation
for HHS, said the although the value of Medicaid and child care
programs are generally accepted, the benefits of JOBS programs are
still being weighed. Therefore the need for a precise experiment is
greater, he said.
   ``I don't see here, yet, any real disadvantage to the person who
is not picked'' to go into JOBS, Gerry said.
   JOBS was created by the Family Support Act of 1988. It requires
states to have specific educational and job training programs for
people who are, or are likely to become, long-term welfare
recipients.
   The law set aside $500,000 a year to pay for control-based
experiments to evaluate the program.
   In states included in the experiment, a small percentage of
those who meet the guidelines for inclusion into JOBS will be
randomly rejected and placed in a control group. Their ability to
find work will be compared to those in the JOBS program.
   The experiment's results will be used to adjust the program,
federal officials said.

<HEAD>Cuba Calls Party Congress Meeting For Next Year; Hints at Reform</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with background on Cuban-Soviet ties; no
pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba's hard-line Communist Party called for a
party congress next year, the official Cuban news agency said
Saturday in a dispatch that hinted the party will consider economic
and political reforms.
   Cuba's Fidel Castro has remained one of the Communist world's
staunchest Stalinist holdouts and has criticized the democratic
reforms that have swept out Old Guard Communist leaders in Eastern
Europe over the past year.
   While Saturday's Prensa Latina dispatch was the first indication
that Cuba is willing to consider change, the report said the
Communists also reaffirmed ``revolutionary principles'' and cited a
need to strengthen Cuba's defense.
   The dispatch came less than a month after Castro declared on
Jan. 28 that Cuba would stick to orthodox Communism even if its
longtime ally, the Soviet Union, cut off $5 billion a year in aid.
   He also said he would brook no political liberalizations and
rejected a petition for recognition by an opposition party based in
Miami.
   The U.S. State Department in Washington had no independent
knowledge of Saturday's report and could not comment, said an
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Communist Party Central Committee said Friday that on March
15 it would announce the date of next year's party congress, Prensa
Latina reported in the dispatch, monitored in Mexico City.
   ``The members of the high body studied an analysis made by the
political bureau about fundamental problems that should be tackled
by the fourth party congress, that need to be debated and
adopted,'' Prensa Latina said, quoting Cuba's official Communist
Party daily Granma.
   ``At Friday's meeting, the committee promised to improve results
in the process of correcting the sphere of economic and social
development, such as in the political conscience of the country,''
it said.
   The news agency said the Central Committee also reaffirmed its
support for Castro, who came to power in 1959.
   ``There is agreement that conditions have matured enough to
tackle in practical and concrete terms as to perfect the political
system in the country,'' Prensa Latina said.
   Despite indicating a willingness to consider reforms, the
dispatch said the Cuban government remains committed to its
fundamental policies.
   ``Analyzing these realities in light of the situation of
socialism on the world level, the meeting concluded that if Cuba
has been able to maintain itself despite certain errors, it was due
to our sticking to a revolutionary policy,'' Prensa Latina said.
   ``It should remain clear that this critical analysis will not
question Cuba's principles and will discuss how to make more
perfect a united Leninist party based on democratic centralism,''
it said.
   Prensa Latina apparently referred to the U.S. invasion of Panama
in December as a reason to maintain its defenses.
   ``Facing the crisis of socialism and the aggressive euphoria of
American imperialism, we need to continue strengthening our
defenses and preparing the people to resist and conquer any
aggression.
   ``It is necessary to analyze the immediate and long-term goals
of the revolution. We will follow the light of our principles
without ever responding to external pressures,'' the dispatch said.
   Cuba is heavily dependent on Soviet economic aid and there have
been signs the assistance is being pared.
   U.S. sources last year said there had been substantial
reductions in Soviet aid to Cuba as evidenced in the marked decline
in the purchase of sugar, which the Soviet Union buys from Cuba at
prices substantially higher than world market levels as a form of
subsidy.
   During a visit to Havana in April, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev made no move to ease Cuba's debt burden, which last year
was estimated at between $8 billion and $12 billion. Cuba's debt to
Western nations was believed to be about $6 billion.
   Castro in the past has expressed disapproval of Gorbachev's
domestic reforms as leaning too much toward capitalism.
   ``The (Cuban) revolution will not back down one millimeter, not
even if it is totally blockaded by the United States or if the
Soviet Union totally cuts off its supplies,'' he said last month.

<HEAD>Former Leader of Irish Labor Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEXFORD, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brendan Corish, former leader of the
Irish Labor Party and deputy prime minister from 1973 to 1977, died
Saturday in a nursing home in Wexford, his family said. He was 71.
   The cause of death was not disclosed.
   Corish was an old-fashioned Irish socialist and professional
politician who in 1945 inherited the Wexford seat in the Dail,
Ireland's parliament, from his father, Richard. He succeeded
William Norton as Labor Party leader in 1960.
   In the 1973 general election, Labor sided with the right-wing
Fine Gael party to form a coalition that narrowly defeated Fianna
Fail, which had held power without a break since 1957. Liam
Cosgrave, the Fine Gael leader, became prime minister and Corish
was minister of health and social welfare.
   The coalition lasted four years and ended on a low note in 1977
when it was decisively defeated at the polls by Fianna Fail led by
Jack Lynch, who became prime minister. Cosgrave and Corish both
resigned their party leaderships.
   Fine Gael and Labor formed a coalition to govern again in 1981
after an inconclusive general election in which no party secured a
majority. Corish subsequently resigned from politics.
   He is survived by his wife, Phyllis, and two children.

   The government on Saturday said
it will compensate the families of four children and an adult who
were killed last week by an army rocket during an attack on
suspected rebel positions.
   ``The cause of death of the civilians was the explosion of a
rocket launched by a helicopter,'' the Armed Forces Press Committee
said in a statement.
   Air force planes and helicopters last Sunday bombed suspected
leftist rebel positions in Chaltenango province, in northeastern El
Salvador. Fifteen people were injured.
   The attack occurred in Corral de Piedra, about 50 miles
northeast of San Salvador, the capital.
   It was the second time the government announced indemnities for
civilian losses in the country's decade-old civil war.
   In a similar attack in 1985, the government paid civilians for
their losses from an army bombing. The number of casualties in that
incident was not reported.

   More than half the members of the United
Nations owe $1.59 billion in back dues at a time when the world
body faces mounting fiscal problems due to its growing peacemaking
role, officials say.
   Of the total amount due by 81 countries, roughly $1.09 billion
is for the regular budget and about $500 million for U.N.
peacekeeping missions, according to a U.N. report released Friday.
   The United States owes the largest share, $772 million, the
report said. The Soviet Union owes $229 million.
   The regular budget for the 159-member world body is for the U.N.
headquarters in New York, Vienna and Geneva, and for smaller
offices in more than 70 countries.
   A two-year budget of $1.98 billion has been approved for
1990-91, with about $935 million of that for this year.
   Member contributions for 1990 became overdue on Feb. 1.
   ``In light of all that the organization is being asked to do at
the moment, I think it is high time that the U.N. be able to leave
its financial worries behind,'' said U.N. spokesman Matthew Nerzig.
   In recent years the United Nations has heightened its
involvement in mediating regional conflicts, clearing the way for
an end to the Iran-Iraq war and overseeing the transition to
independence in Namibia. The five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council _ the United States, Soviet Union, France, Britain
and China _ have recommended a major role in Cambodia peace efforts.

<HEAD>10 People, Four Companies Named in Obscenity Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Obscenity charges were issued against a
satellite adult-movie channel and three other companies, including
GTE Corp., over broadcasts of what officials described as hard-core
sex movies.
   Four companies and 10 people were indicted by a county grand
jury over the movies, which authorities said were picked up on home
satellite dishes and in some cases recorded and shared by
teen-agers.
   Among those named in the 18-count indictment unsealed Friday
were GTE Corp. of Stamford, Conn.; a subsidiary, GTE Spacenet Inc.
of McLean, Va.; U.S. Satellite Inc. of Murray, Utah, and Home Dish
Satellite Networks Inc. of New York City, also known as the
Exxxtasy Channel.
   The names of the individuals charged were withheld because they
hadn't been served with court papers, said Montgomery County
District Attorney Jimmy Evans.
   The charges involve allegedly obscene videos with titles such as
``Hardcore Girlfriends'' and ``Fantasy Chamber'' that were beamed
into Alabama on the American Exxxtasy Channel.
   Colette Connor, vice president of advertising and promotion for
Home Dish Satellite Network, denied wrongdoing.
   ``The movies that we broadcast, as far as we know, have never
been judged obscene,'' she said.
   Barbara Foelbar, manager of corporate communications for GTE
Spacenet, said ``as a communications common carrier, regulated by
the (Federal Communications Commission), we have no authority to
censor what customers use our satellite to transmit.''
   An attorney for U.S. Satellite Inc. said he hadn't seen the
indictments and couldn't comment on them.
   An investigation of the transmissions began about a year ago
after Evans' office received complaints from parents whose children
were buying copies of adult movies at school.
   ``The movies had been taped by other students off satellite dish
transmissions,'' he said.
   Gov. Guy Hunt and the governors of Utah, Virginia and New York
will be asked to arrange extradition of those defendants to
Alabama, the prosecutor said.
   Evans said that for $150, anyone with a satellite dish, code
number and descrambler could subscribe to American Exxxstasy for
six months. He said his investigators began taping the material and
found it contained graphic sex scenes which he called ``hard-core
obscenity'' and ``clearly a violation of the Anti-Obscenity Act.''
   That law, approved by the Legislature in May, expanded the
definition of obscene materials to include telephone and electronic
communications.
   Evans said he sought federal cooperation in the prosecution on
grounds the defendants may have violated federal obscenity statutes.
   The mother of a porn star who committed suicide in 1984 after
two years of making movies came to Montgomery to testify before the
grand jury.
   Karen Applegate of Burnsville, Minn., said some of the movies
made by her daughter, Colleen, are still shown on the Exxxtasy
Channel.
   ``The only reason I'm here is to get rid of (my daughter's)
films and stop the men who use her,'' she said. ``Those men made
money off her before her death, they don't have to after.''
   The charges carry a maximum penalty of 36 years in prison and a
$540,000 fine against each defendant. The state also could seize
property and profits, which Evans said could amount to millions of
dollars.

   Rival Protestant and Roman
Catholic soccer fans rioted at a match Saturday, and police said
they fired plastic bullets into the stands to stop the disturbance.
   Forty-eight police officers and 15 civilians were injured and
one officer and one civilian hospitalized, police said.
   The violence spread from the stadium to surrounding streets, and
fans hijacked buses and set them on fire, a statement from the
Royal Ulster Constabulary said.
   In other incidents later, police said a bomb exploded near an
army vehicle in southwest Belfast, slightly injuring two soldiers
on patrol. A second bomb exploded 10 minutes later in a parking
area at the Greenan Lodge Hotel in the west of the city after an
anonymous warning that allowed police to evacuate the building in
time. No injures were reported at the hotel.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either blast.
   The violence at the stadium was the worst in years at a soccer
game in Northern Ireland. Sports events are usually free of the
fighting between Protestants and the Roman Catholic minority that
has torn other areas of life in the British province. Security
forces had feared trouble at the game, a first-round match in the
Bass Irish Cup competition, so it was delayed 25 minutes until the
spectators were seated.
   The police _ who said many fans ``were under the influence of
drink'' _ had formed a barrier between supporters of the Linfield
team, which has a tradition of having only Protestant players, and
Donegal Celtic, a team based in a Catholic neighborhood of West
Belfast.
   Police said one Linfield supporter got onto the field and
attacked a Celtic player and ``serious public disorder'' continued
in Donegal Celtic's area.
   Officers were pelted with bottles and stones and had to use riot
shields to protect themselves, police said.
   The officers eventually charged fans in the Donegal Celtic area
to keep from being overrun by the crowd and had to fire plastic
bullets ``to repel the sustained attack,'' the Royal Ulster
Constabulary said.
   Trouble flared again at half time and continued sporadically
during the remainder of the match, which Linfield won, 2-1.
   After the game, ``as the Donegal Celtic supporters made their
way home through west Belfast, they hijacked four buses and set
them on fire,'' the police statement said.
   Officers fired more plastic bullets to disperse those crowds, it
said.
   The statement also said a bomb had been discovered in an empty
house ``convenient to where police would have been taking up duty
to see these supporters through the area.'' It was being defused,
and no one had claimed responsibility, police said.
   The soccer match had been drawn to be played at the Donegal
Celtic ground in the heart of Catholic West Belfast. But the Irish
Football Association, fearing trouble, switched it to Windsor Park,
Northern Ireland's international soccer ground, which is also home
to Linfield.
   Celtic failed in a High Court bid to have the match switched to
a neutral spot.

<HEAD>Reuters Plans to End News Pictures Agreement With UPI</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reuters, which announced it will end its news
picture agreement with United Press International, continued to
supply photos on Saturday to UPI amid a public flap between the two
news services.
   Under a 10-year agreement begun in January 1985, UPI has been
supplying Reuters with news pictures from the United States while
Reuters supplied UPI with news pictures from abroad.
   On Friday, Reuters abruptly stopped sending photos to UPI,
saying it was dissatisfied with the quality of photographs supplied
by UPI and intended to start its own U.S. photo coverage. It
resumed sending photographs to UPI after UPI threatened a lawsuit.
   ``We told them they were way out of line through our
attorneys,'' UPI Vice Chairman Joe Taussig said Friday.
   He added that Reuters offered to turn the service back on if UPI
would agree not to sue for breach of contract. UPI made no
agreement and is still considering legal action, Taussig said.
   Taussig said the original agreement calls for either service to
give 10 days notice of intent to terminate.
   But on Saturday, Milt Capps, the senior vice president for
corporate affairs at UPI, said: ``Earlier comments about the 10-day
period may have been in error.''
   He said UPI lawyers are reviewing the contract to determine if
Reuters had violated it.
   UPI is considering restarting its own international photo
coverage and also studying a photo exchange agreement with other
foreign news service agencies, Capps said.
   Reuters said it restarted the service Friday night after a
senior UPI official called and asked that the service be resumed
temporarily.
   Capps said no senior UPI official had made such a request.
   Andrew M. Nibley, editor of Reuters America, said in a statement
released early Saturday: ``At their request this evening, we agreed
to temporarily continue providing them with non-U.S. pictures.
However, we will no longer be using UPI pictures.
   ``We will be covering the United States with our own resources
to ensure a quality service to our subscribers in the United States
and abroad.''
   The dispute between the two news services started Friday when
Reuters issued a news release announcing it was ending its
agreement with UPI and starting up its own news photo network in
the United States.
   In addition, Reuters filed a lawsuit to recoup money it says it
lost on the agreement. The company didn't say what those claims
might total.
   ``It has not been an easy decision. It's essentially a quality
issue. We do not want their pictures,'' said Robert A. Crooke, a
spokesman for Reuters America.
   As to why Reuters was providing photographs to UPI, he said:
``This is simply giving them some continued international coverage
for a limited amount of time.''
   In a statement released Friday before the service was restored,
UPI said the abrupt cancellation of the photo exchange ``was
unjustified and without regard for the interest of both companies'
subscribing newspapers.''
   UPI Chairman Earl W. Brian said the news service ``is outraged
at the sneak termination of the Reuters international picture
service, for which there was no basis whatever.''
   UPI is owned by Infotechnology Inc., a holding company with
interests in scientific and information ventures, which completed
acquisition of the company that controls the news service in March
1989 from Mexican publisher Mario Vazquez Rana. UPI lost $16
million in 1988 and $25 million in 1987.
   Reuters presently supplies news photographs directly to 20
United States newspapers and 500 newspapers around the world,
Crooke said.

<HEAD>AFL-CIO Leaders Attempt to Regain Lost Clout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AFL-CIO leaders are using their annual winter
trek to Florida as a strategy summit designed to help unions regain
bargaining clout lost in the 1980s and to bolster the chances of
labor-supported candidates and legislation heading into 1990
elections.
   Union chiefs gathering in Bal Harbour will try to capitalize on
the unity and renewed fighting spirit many said has been felt
following successful strikes in 1989 by Appalachia coal miners and
telephone workers in the Northeast, where unions won on key
bargaining points.
   ``It was one of the most traumatic decades for organized labor _
it was ushered in with union busting but ushered out by union
building,'' said Jan Pierce, vice president of the Communications
Workers of America in charge of the New York region.
   The Pittston coal strike served as a rallying point for
organized labor. At one point before a tentative settlement was
reached New Year's Eve, some 46,000 coal workers in 10 states
walked off their jobs in sympathy strikes.
   ``There's a new spirit of solidarity. Unions are again living up
to the credo that an injury to one is an injury to all,'' Pierce
said.
   Also on this week's agenda for the AFL-CIO's Executive Council
is the second meeting between the 33-member board and Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole; meetings with several prominent officials
of the Democratic Party, one of labor's traditional allies; and
domestic and international issues.
   Abortion is expected to dominate much of the behind-the-scenes
maneuvering, though AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland has already
said a vote on pro-choice resolutions will be skipped and instead a
committee will study whether the 14.1 million member federation
should take a stand.
   Recent Labor Department statistics show that union membership
has remained fairly constant since 1985 at about 17 million, but
the percentage of the workforce that is unionized has dropped to
about 16 percent _ meaning that labor is not bringing in new
members to match the rapid growth of the workforce. In 1985, for
instance, 18 percent of the workforce belonged to unions.
   AFL-CIO spokesman Rex Hardesty said union officials realize that
future organizing drives will have to center around issues such as
health care that employers are reluctant to provide.
   ``We bottomed out in the 1980s, and it was just brutal. But
we've gotten up off the floor,'' Hardesty said.
   Still, others noted that unions suffered their share of setbacks
last year, such as the machinists' walkout at Eastern Airlines.
   The strike, which continues, was dealt a major blow last
November when pilots and flight attendants ended sympathy strikes.
Their defection followed President Bush's veto of legislation
establishing a special congressional panel to propose a solution to
the strike.
   ``A whole bunch of workers got kicked around a lot. We're not
out of the woods yet ... in the face of all the monkey wrenches
that can be thrown at us, we still have a rotten situation,'' said
Paul Booth, organizing director for the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees.
   Booth and others contend the Bush administration is following
former President Reagan's anti-union lead by allowing employers to
intimidate workers who try to organize.
   Many labor leaders felt Reagan, who fired striking air traffic
controllers in 1981 and effectively killed their union, was the
worst president of the century for organized labor.
   Union officials will continue efforts for a warmer relationship
with the Bush administration as Mrs. Dole visits with council
members Tuesday.
   Also on labor leaders' mind this week will be the upcoming 1990
elections as a steady stream of political heavyweights make
appearances.
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Ronald Brown, House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the chairmen of the
House and Senate Democratic election committees and two senators
who face tough re-election bids _ Paul Simon of Illinois and Tom
Harkin of Iowa _ are among those who will meet with union officials.
   Gephardt will discuss major bills before Congress this year that
labor is interested in, such as legislation involving health care
and child care and the proposed Social Security payroll tax cut.
   Brown and DNC staff will be discussing the party's campaign for
statehouse seats around the nation, since control of state
legislatures will dictate which party controls congressional
redistricting. Labor is providing much of the funding for the
party's redistricting effort and also is involved in identifying
potential candidates for targeted state races.

<HEAD>Report: IRS Investigating if Foreign Companies Underpaying Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal tax officials are using new auditing
powers to investigate the American subsidiaries of Japanese
companies they suspect have underpaid corporate income taxes by
billions of dollars, according to a published report.
   The New York Times reported in its Sunday editions that while
foreign-owned assets in the United States more than tripled in 10
years to $1.8 billion and gross income of foreign firms here more
than doubled, the amount of taxes paid didn't change much.
   Data compiled by the Internal Revenue Service indicates that of
36,000 foreign-owned companies, more than half didn't report any
reported taxable income.
   Tax officials say subsidiaries underestimate their earnings to
reduce their tax liability by manipulating transactions with parent
companies, the Times said.
   But the government, often thwarted in its efforts to review the
records of such companies, is now armed with a new law that gives
the IRS broad authority to assess taxes on foreign-owned firms that
fail to promptly comply for requests for records or testimony.
   ``We don't target a particular country for enforcement,''
Charles S. Triplett, deputy associate chief counsel of the tax
agency told the Times. ``Nonetheless, it's pretty clear that the
Japanese do a lot of business here and have many U.S. subsidiaries
acting as distributors of manufactured goods.''
   The Japan Tax Association said the IRS was partly to blame
because it had failed to establish ``concrete guidelines'' for
determining the right price of transactions between branches of a
multi-national company.
   Tadashi Iwashita, a financial counselor at the Japanese Embassy
in Washington, D.C., said Japanese firms try to comply with U.S.
tax laws.
   One unidentified IRS official told the Times the agency suspects
that underpayments amount to at least $12 billion.

<TEXT>
   Residents lined up against Mayor Richard M.
Daley's plan to build a third airport in Chicago, voicing concern
that their neighborhoods would be eliminated by his proposal.
   ``Isn't there some other place he could put this thing, some
other place than this town?'' resident Mary Ann Kolojay asked.
   The plan would virtually obliterate her Hegewisch neighborhood
on Chicago's far southeast side.
   Hegewisch _ an old steel mill neighborhood separated from the
city by stretches of landfills, factories and vacant lots _ is one
of two neighborhoods and two suburbs where 6,700 homes and 47
businesses would be demolished to make way for the proposed Lake
Calumet Airport.
   ``We have all this land everywhere and they still have to
flatten this town,'' Kolojay said, while working a cash register at
a local food store.
   ``Why not Bridgeport?'' said resident Mike Hennessy, referring
to Daley's neighborhood.
   Daley said the $4.9 billion project would rejuvenate an area
impoverished over the last decade by the decline of the mills and
other industry. He said the airport would generate 200,000 jobs and
$13.7 billion in annual revenue.
   The airport, scheduled to open in 2010, would be 20 percent
larger than O'Hare International Airport on the city's far
northwest side and 15 times the size of Midway Airport, southwest
of Chicago.
   O'Hare has been criticized by federal officials as being
overcrowded and the cause of national travel delays. The question
of a third airport has been under debate for months and four other
sites have been proposed.
   Federal Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner and Illinois
Gov. James R. Thompson said that Daley's proposal, unveiled
Thursday, will be considered with the others.
   ``We are a long way from having a third airport,'' said Gregory
Baise, chairman of a three-state committee conducting a $6 million,
study to pick a rural south suburban site. ``I would view (Daley's)
plan very skeptically.''

<TEXT>
   NEW YORK _ Billionaire Donald Trump says the news media in New
York has treated him unfairly and inaccurately reported his
separation from his wife, Ivana, according to a published report.
   The Daily News in New York reported in its Sunday editions that
Trump is unhappy with extensive coverage of his marital problems in
New York's tabloid papers and local television stations.
   ``I think the news media should be ashamed of itself,'' Trump
told the News in a telephone interview. ``I'm sure that it sells,
and people don't care for the truth.
   ``They have me with women I never even met before. They have me
with women I shook hands with.
   On Saturday, the Daily News quoted an anonymous source as saying
Trump was upset by coverage of the split and was considering
``dropping the whole thing.''
   Trump lawyers Jay Goldberg and Stanford Lotwin couldn't be
reached Saturday, but they told the Daily News they knew nothing
about any possible reconciliation.
   No legal action has yet been taken by either Trump.
   Mrs. Trump was in seclusion Friday at the couple's Greenwich,
Conn., home with the couple's three children, New York Newsday
reported Saturday. On Saturday, according to the Daily News, they
were in Florida.
   Mrs. Trump met with Cardinal John O'Connor Friday in his office.
   ``It was a private meeting,'' said archdiocesan spokesman Joe
Zwilling, who declined to say what was discussed.
   Mrs. Trump's father, Milos Zelnicek, flew from Czechoslovakia to
be by his daughter's side, the New York Post said.
   Mrs. Trump reportedly burst into tears Friday when she saw the
Post's front page story quoting alleged ``other woman'' Marla
Maples as saying Trump was the ``best sex I've ever had,'' the Post
reported.
   Miss Maples' manager, Chuck Jones, was quoted in Saturday's Post
as saying his client called the quote a ``blatant lie'' made up by
a jealous actress-friend.

   The Virginia budget is shrinking, but Gov.
L. Douglas Wilder's limousine has grown a few inches and nearly
doubled in cost over the one used by his predecessor.
   Wilder's black Lincoln Town Car is a wee bit longer than the
stretch Cadillac used by ex-Gov. Gerald L. Baliles. But Wilder's
limo is costing the state $37,923 plus trade-in of the Cadillac,
which cost $19,949 plus trade-in four years ago.
   Wilder's car will be delivered in about six weeks, Curtis Wells,
general manager of the dealership, said Saturday. It will have a
keyless entry system, a 5-liter V-8 engine and six-way adjustable
power seats.
   Since taking office, Wilder has pleaded for fiscal austerity
among state agencies. On Friday, the House Finance Committee sent a
$267 million package of revenue enhancement bills to the floor to
help Virginia balance its proposed $25.8 billion budget.
   Car prices have gone up in four years, said Laura F. Dillard,
the governor's press secretary. Plus, she said, former Gov. Charles
S. Robb's car commanded a higher trade-in price to bring the cost
of the Baliles car down.
   New governors traditionally trade in the vehicle of their
predecessors.

   ``As you get older, I think you need to put your arms around

   Japan held parliamentary elections Sunday that put
the scandal-plagued governing Liberal Democratic Party to its
toughest test in decades.
   A controversial sales tax and sex- and influence-peddling
scandals have dogged Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's party for
nearly two years, forcing the resignation of two prime ministers.
   On Saturday, hundreds of candidates wearing white gloves to
symbolize clean politics held final campaign rallies, and the issue
was on the minds of some voters.
   ``The consumption tax and cleaning up politics are the most
important issues in this election,'' said a middle-aged woman
coming out of a voting booth who declined to give her name.
   But Masaru Oshima, 48, said although opposition parties are
gaining support, ``their policies are unclear and their leadership
untested.'' He said he voted for the Liberal Democrats.
   Polls indicated that the large number of uncommitted voters
could hurt the Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan
since 1955. The conservative party needed to win at least 257 seats
in the 512-seat lower house of Parliament to retain its majority
and win the right to name the prime minister.
   The Liberal Democrats hold 295 seats in the outgoing house, to
83 for the main opposition, the Socialist Party.
   A victory for the Socialists could lead to Japan having its
first female prime minister _ 61-year-old Socialist Chairwoman
Takako Doi.
   Polls opened at 7:00 a.m. (5 p.m. EST Saturday) and were to
close 11 hours later. Partial election results were expected later
Sunday, but final results were not expected until Monday afternoon.
   Mild winter weather across the country was expected to
contribute to an unusually high voter turnout; polls predicted 80
percent of Japan's 90 million eligible voters would cast ballots.
   A poll released Saturday by the nationwide Asahi Shimbun
newspaper reaffirmed earlier surveys showing the Liberal Democrats
leading the Socialists by about 20 percentage points.
   But 32.2 percent of the 103,200 people surveyed said they had
not decided which party they supported. The newspaper did not
provide a margin of error for the survey, conducted Feb. 8-9 and
11-12.
   Ms. Doi said Sunday she was ``confident that people will move
the mountain a second time,'' referring July elections for the less
powerful upper house of Parliament in which the governing party
lost its majority for the first time in 34 years. That chamber is
now controlled by a Socialist-led coalition.
   Outside his Tokyo residence, Kaifu told reporters, ``It's up to
the judgment of the people, but I'm certain that the Liberal
Democratic Party's policies are generally accepted by the people.''
   Both leaders voted earlier by absentee ballots.
   At a rally Saturday, Kaifu urged several thousand people at
Tokyo's Shinjuku Station not to be swayed by the opposition.
   He accused the Socialists of being unclear on their position on
defense and said a comment by Ms. Doi that such issues could be
worked out ``overnight'' after the election was ``irresponsible.''
   ``We can't allow someone who does things overnight to take over
this precious country,'' he said.
   In an effort to win support from conservatives, the Socialists
watered down their longstanding opposition to the U.S.-Japan
security treaty, under which the United States bases 50,000 troops
in Japan. But opposition to the treaty remains party policy, giving
the conservatives an opening to accuse Socialists of weakening
Japan's security.
   The Liberal Democrats had a disastrous year in 1989, caused by
scandal and the passage of the unpopular 3 percent sales tax in
April.
   Also in April, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita resigned to
accept responsibility for an influence-peddling scandal in which
politicians profited from sales of cut-rate stock shares supplied
by the Recruit Co. conglomerate.
   Takeshita's replacement, Sousuke Uno, lasted only two months and
was plagued by allegations of extramarital affairs.
   He quit after the sex scandal and sales tax cost the Liberal
Democrats their majority in the upper house in the July election.
The party also lost farmers' support for partly opening
agricultural markets to imports.
   Ms. Doi urged several thousand people at a rally in the western
Tokyo suburb of Hachioji to ``show you believe the consumption tax
and money politics are unforgivable.''
   Kaifu, 59, urged voters not to base their decisions solely on
the sales tax and promised the Liberal Democrats would not allow
another Recruit scandal.
   ``The LDP will repeat right policies, but we will never repeat
wrongdoings,'' he said.
   The Uno scandal and the sales tax, which was particularly
disliked by housewives who do most of the family shopping, gave
women in this male-dominated society a new voice in politics. The
women's vote was said to have played a large part in the Liberal
Democrats' election loss in July.
   The Liberal Democrats fielded 338 candidates; Socialists 149;
Komeito (Clean Government Party) 58; Japan Communist Party 131;
Democratic Socialist Party 44; United Social Democratic Party 6;
and the Progressive Party 7. There were 64 candidates from minor
parties and 156 running as independents.

   The Boeing 727 airliner made famous by
D.B. Cooper is being dismantled for money _ not the skyjacker's
ransom but for spare parts.
   The jet arrived Friday at the Greenwood-Leflore Airport where it
will be disassembled for parts by The Memphis Group, a
Tennessee-based company.
   The company purchased the airplane from American Transair, which
bought the airplane from Northwest Airlines several years ago for
charter flights.
   The jetliner was the one hijacked on Nov. 24, 1971, by a ``D.B.
Cooper.'' A man using that name hijacked the plane during a flight
from Portland, Ore., to Seattle. He demanded $200,000 in $20 bills
and four parachutes.
   After the aircraft landed in Seattle, he released the 36
passengers and some of the crew in exchange for the ransom.
   Cooper ordered the crew to fly to Reno, Nev. Somewhere over
southwest Washington, Cooper opened an exit door and jumped. He has
never been located and his body was never found.

   Federal investigators said Friday they
smashed a pirate video movie ring that produced 1,500 illegal
videocassettes a week for distribution to rental stores in the
Northeast.
   The investigation, described by film industry officials as the
most damaging operation ever against video bootlegers, led to the
arrests of seven people in New Jersey and New York in raids
Thursday night, said Gary Penrith, acting special agent in charge
of the FBI's Newark office.
   During those raids, he said, agents discovered a video
duplicating lab in a home in the New York borough of Queens packed
with 78 state-of-the-art video recorders and about 2,000 copies of
video movies popular in the rental market.
   Agents also found what they believe to be a distribution center
in a private home that manufactured phony labels and boxes for the
videos and shipped them to stores in the Northeast, officials said.
   ``For us this series of seizures in New York and New Jersey
represents the toughest crackdown ever on video piracy,'' said Mark
Harrad, an attorney and investigator who worked with federal agents
on the case for the Motion Picture Association of America.
   ``We've had bigger seizures, but the discovery of the labs and
distribution centers are really the most significant thing,'' he
said.
   Neither the FBI nor the motion picture association could provide
an estimate of how much money the bootleg ring cost the industry.
   Authorities believe the Queens lab was producing at least 1,500
illegal videocassettes a week, said Jack Valenti, president of the
movie association.
   Arrested in New York were Julio Larraquente, owner of Video
Latino and Sarita Feldman, owner of Latin Video, both in the New
York borough of Brooklyn.
   In New Jersey, agents arrested Walter Martinez, 45, owner of
Paradise Video &amp; Record in Paterson; Santiago Branopolsky, 48, of
North Bergen; Eddie Torres, 22, of Marlboro, Mass.; and Felix
Humberto Blas-Aguilar, 20, of Union City.

   U.S. Customs Service agents have confiscated 30
million empty crack vials worth $3 million and other drug
paraphernalia in a series of arrests here and Los Angeles, federal
officials announced Friday.
   During the last three days, special agents in New York arrested
11 people involved in the smuggling and distribution of drug
paraphernalia, the service said in a statement.
   In addition to the vials, agents seized 40 million plastic bags
valued at $639,000, three 1989 luxury automobiles and $14,500.
   The investigation started Dec. 13 last year when 270 cartons of
plastic vials were found during a routine investigation by a Los
Angeles inspector. The vials had been smuggled into the country as
part of a shipment of cast iron from Taiwan.
   Customs agents then tracked the cartons, which contained about
10 million vials, to a warehouse in Elizabeth, N.J., and on to a
warehouse in the New York City borough of Queens, where nine people
were arrested Wednesday as they unloaded the cartons.
   The next day, agents executed search warrants at nine locations
in Queens and confiscated 20 million additional vials and the 40
million plastic bags.
   At the same time, customs agents executed a search warrant at
the offices of Success Systems Services in San Gabriel, Calif.
   The seizures and arrests are part of the customs services effort
known as ``Operation Pipe'' designed to confiscate drug
paraphernalia.

<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Sean Connery pulled a James
Bond stunt and drove at high speeds along a scenic highway, but
police nabbed him. He admitted guilt and paid a fine, authorities
said.
   ``007 did it. But unlike Zsa Zsa, he didn't fight with police,''
said Bob Calvert, Santa Barbara County chief trial deputy,
referring to Miss Gabor's conviction for slapping a Beverly Hills
policeman who stopped her Rolls-Royce.
   Connery, through his attorney, on Thursday paid a $190 speeding
ticket for going 82 mph in a 55 mph zone. He was driving a rented
1989 Thunderbird when he was caught along the two-lane Highway 154
near the Southern California town of Solvang last Dec. 23.
   A California Highway patrolman ticketed him for speeding and for
driving without a license.
   The latter charge was dismissed after Connery's attorney showed
the star had a British driver's license.
   ``Too bad he wasn't in an Austin Healy and got away with an oil
slick or smoke screen,'' Calvert said. ``All the secretaries in the
office were going crazy. They wanted me to make sure that he
appeared in court. I would've lost a whole day's work if he did.''
   Connery, the first of four actors to play Bond, starred in
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' one of the top grossing
movies of 1989 with $196 million. His newest film, ``The Hunt for
Red October'' opens next month.

   The Export-Import Bank said Friday night it

   Financing and related insurance services were cut off in
December 1987 as part of the U.S. campaign against the regime of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the dictator deposed by the U.S.
invasion last Dec. 20.
   Economic sanctions have been lifted since the establishment of a
new government and Congress has voted extra aid to Panama.
   The bank said short-term insurance was available for both public

insurance for up tom five years is available for private sector
buyers.

<HEAD>Investigator Says Hazelwood Didn't Seem Drunk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Coast Guard investigator said Joseph
Hazelwood smelled of alcohol but otherwise did not appear drunk the
night his Exxon Valdez went aground, causing the nation's worst oil
spill.
   Mark Delozier, one of the first officers to board the Exxon
Valdez after it rammed a reef last March 24, testified Friday that
he called for someone to administer blood and urine tests to the
crew after first encountering Hazelwood and smelling liquor on his
breath.
   But Delozier said his message to Coast Guard headquarters was
misinterpreted and a state police officer was dispatched with a
different mission.
   ``He was under the impression he was supposed to come out to the
ship to take ahold of an unruly drunk,'' Delozier said, noting the
officer brought no testing equipment.
   ``I was disgusted at the fact that we had already waited a few
hours and now he was going to be of no use to us,'' he said, noting
that the passage of time meant alcohol could dissipate from blood
and urine.
   But Delozier acknowledged that Hazelwood seemed coordinated and
showed no sign of being intoxicated other than the smell of his
breath.
   Delozier said Hazelwood had ``a very intense and very obvious''
smell of liquor about him and was trying to hide it by covering his
mouth and drinking coffee.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with one felony
count of second-degree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of
reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating a
vessel while intoxicated. If convicted, the former tanker skipper
could draw up to 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled from the Exxon
Valdez into Prince William Sound on March 24, killing countless
birds, fish and wildlife and blackening hundreds of miles of rocky
shore.
   Delozier, who boarded the ship about 3{ hours after it ran
aground on Bligh Reef, said he first saw Hazelwood standing at a
window in his cabin with an elbow on a window sill and his hand
covering his mouth.
   Because of the confusion about sending test equipment to the
ship, the blood and urine tests were not taken until 10{ hours
after the accident, he said.
   Before Delozier took the stand, a forensic toxicologist
testified that Hazelwood's blood and urine tested positive for
alcohol.
   Michael A. Peat, of Sacramento, Calif., said Hazelwood had a
level of 0.061 percent of alcohol in his blood and 0.094 percent in
his urine.
   He said the blood and urine tests almost never result in the
same figures and did not explain the significance of the amounts
found.
   The blood alcohol test was under the Alaska state limit of 0.10
for driving a vehicle, but over the federal limit of 0.04 for
operating a commercial vessel.
   Ironically, Delozier acknowledged that he had been drinking the
night before the accident at the same Valdez bar where Hazelwood is
alleged to have gotten drunk earlier in the same day.
   DeLozier said he had only two light beers and did not consider
himself intoxicated but conceded that someone talking to him might
have smelled beer on his breath.
   ``Mr. Delozier, are you sure you weren't smelling your own
breath?'' Chalos asked of the confrontation with Hazelwood.
   ``Absolutely,'' Delozier responded.

   Soul singer Ike Turner, former
husband of Grammy-winning singer Tina Turner, has begun serving a
prison sentence for cocaine convictions.
   Superior Judge Robert Altman sentenced Turner, 58, to four years
in state prison Friday. Turner had asked to be admitted to a
rehabilitation program instead, but Altman refused, noting Turner
already had entered several such programs.
   Prosecutor Ralph Mayer said, ``He's not the type of criminal
that's in any way violent ... He's just a 20-year abuser of the
drugs who should have been caught a long time ago.''
   A Superior Court jury convicted Turner last month of driving
under the influence of cocaine and being under the influence of
cocaine, both misdemeanors.
   The panel deadlocked 8-4 in favor of acquittal on two felony
charges, transportation of cocaine and possession of cocaine for
sale, forcing a mistrial. Turner then pleaded guilty, avoiding
another trial, Mayer said.
   The charges stem from an Aug. 19, 1987, arrest by sheriff's
deputies who stopped Turner after his car was traveling erratically
in West Hollywood. Deputies found crystallized cocaine in the car.

   Tenor Vladimir Popov, more jittery than

U.S. citizen, eight years after he defected from the Soviet Union.
   ``I've been before thousands of people,'' he nervously told a
naturalization official in halting English before taking the oath
Friday, ``but this is more.''
   Popov, who lives in Wentworth, N.H., flew in from Washington for
the ceremony and planned to return in time to appear as the lead
when Verdi's ``Aida'' opens today at the Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts.
   With his wife, Lucy, their three children and other relatives
excitedly looking on, Popov took the oath in the court of U.S.
District Judge Shane Devine. He was the only new citizen taking the
oath.
   Afterward, Popov turned to his relatives, puffed out his chest
and smiled as they applauded.
   Popov, 42, a native of Moscow, defected while studying in Milan,
Italy, in 1982, the only time he was allowed out of the Soviet
Union.

   Thousands of Lithuanians took to the streets of
two cities on the anniversary of their 1918 declaration of
independence and demanded freedoms that were lost when the Kremlin
annexed the Baltic state in World War II.
   About 100,000 people attended a rally Friday in the republic's
second-largest city of Kaunas, while 40,000 turned out for a public
meeting in the capital, Vilnius, according to a spokeswoman for
Sajudis, Lithuania's grass-roots pro-independence group.
   Leaders of Sajudis addressed the crowds in both cities, renewing
the republic's demand for independence, Sajudis activist Romuna
Sakoloskejda said by telephone from Vilnius.
   Lithuania's parliament last week approved a resolution declaring
``unlawful and invalid'' the 1940 act that incorporated their
republic with neighboring Latvia and Estonia into the Soviet Union.
They demanded talks with the Kremlin on restoring Lithuanian
independence.
   On Thursday, the Parliament of neighboring Latvia also condemned
the annexation and voted to restore the national anthem and
red-and-white flag of independent Latvia, replacing the Communist
hammer and sickle emblem.
   Lithuania, a hilly region on the Baltic Sea about the size of
West Virginia, was under Russian rule before World War I and
occupied by the German army during the war.
   It became the first Baltic state to declare independence from
both Russia and Germany on Feb. 16, 1918, and its example was soon
followed by Latvia and Estonia.
   But all three Baltic states enjoyed only about two decades of
independence before being swallowed up and incorporated into the
Soviet Union in 1940, after the 1939 Hitler-Stalin pact carved
Eastern Europe into spheres of influence.
   The Soviet Union tried to diminish the local culture by
promoting immigration of Russians to the Baltics, but Lithuanians
still make up about 80 percent of their republic's population.
   Lithuania has spearheaded the Baltic drive for independence from
the Soviet Union. Its Communist Party broke with Moscow in December.
   The Lithuanian moves initially drew sharp criticism and warnings
from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but the Lithuanian party's
move to break with Moscow won it public support at home.
   Lithuania's parliament faces an election Feb. 25, and the
outcome will be a major factor in future relations with Moscow.
   Gorbachev has promised more autonomy for the 15 Soviet
republics. During a visit last month to Lithuania, he announced
that a law is being written that under certain conditions would
allow a republic to secede from the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Attorney General Hopes Bar Group Won't Use Abortion `Litmus Test'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is concerned
that the American Bar Association will use a resolution endorsing
abortion rights to produce a litmus test for screening judicial
nominees.
   But the president of the ABA says the hotly debated resolution
adopted Tuesday in Los Angeles will not affect the way the bar
group evaluates the qualifications of prospective federal judges.
   Thornburgh said in an interview Friday that the resolution could
result in ``a litmus test on judicial nominees.''
   ``If one arm of the ABA is saying something and another arm of
the ABA is evaluating judicial candidates, you want to know what's
the connection between the two arms,'' he said.
   But L. Stanley Chauvin, the ABA president, said the resolution
will not touch the ABA's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary
decisions on rating prospective candidates for federal judgeships.
   ``That wasn't the purpose of the resolution,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``It will not have anything to do with it.
   ``As far as our relationship with Gen. Thornburgh and the
Justice Department, it is as though it never passed,'' said
Chauvin, who voted against the resolution along with John J. Curtin
Jr., the ABA president-elect.
   Adopted by a 2-1 margin following acrimonious debate, the
resolution puts the ABA in opposition to the Bush administration on
abortion rights. Under Thornburgh, the Justice Department has asked
the Supreme Court to overturn its landmark 1971 decision that
legalized abortion.
   Thornburgh has expressed other concerns about the ABA's judicial
screening panel, which conservative critics have charged was used
by liberals to weed out people with views the committee found
unacceptable.
   Thornburgh last spring got from the ABA an agreement to delete
language from its guidelines stating that political and
philosophical views would not be considered, except as they bore on
other factors.
   ABA officials denied the views of candidates were considered,
but Thornburgh threatened to cut the organization out of judicial
screening unless it agreed to change the guidelines.
   On Friday, Thornburgh denied he was again threatening the ABA
with exclusion from the judicial-selection process.
   ``We want to hear from the ABA,'' he said.
   But Thornburgh expressed concern that the members of the
judicial-screening committee might feel compelled to enforce ABA
policy on abortion when interviewing prospective candidates.
   Thornburgh said that, as an ABA member, he objected to the
resolution because ``this view doesn't reflect my views.''
   ``I am concerned that the association would squander its
expertise to express its views in areas where they have no
particular expertise,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviets Lift Navigator Requirement For Alaska-Siberia Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet government Friday rescinded its
requirement that Alaska flights to Siberia have a Soviet navigator
aboard, again opening the door for flights across the Bering Strait.
   The change was announced the same day Federal Aviation
Administration and Soviet of Civil Aviation officials met in
Washington, D.C., to sign a memorandum of cooperation promoting
civil aeronautics and air commerce between the United States and
Soviet Union.
   The agreement sets up air corridors between Anchorage, Gambell,
King Island and Nome, and the Siberian communities of Provideniya,
Magadan, Anadyr and Khabarovsk.
   The Soviets also announced they will upgrade the airport at
Provideniya and give it international status.
   The decision lifting the navigator requirement applies to all
carriers, including Nome's Bering Air.
   While Bering Air's twin-engine commuter planes have made scores
of flights into Siberia since their first flight to Provideniya in
1988, the airline balked when the Soviets required a Soviet
navigator be aboard each flight.
   Bering Air owner Jim Rowe said the $12,000-per-flight cost would
be prohibitive and the airline stopped flying to Siberia in
November. Rowe was in Washington, D.C., on Friday and could not be
reached, his office said.
   The small airline charges $2,500 for each charter to Siberia,
and about $250 for a one-way trip.
   ``This is the first significant step in a two-part effort to
begin regular commercial air service between Alaska and the Soviet
Union,'' Sen. Ted Stevens said in a news release. ``It's welcome.
We've been working toward this for a long time.''

<HEAD>Report Says Terrorism Down Overall, but Iran Not Letting Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials believe international terrorism
is declining although attacks by Iranian-sponsored Shiite groups
are on the increase.
   ``Iran believes terrorism is a legitimate part of foreign
policy,'' said an American official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Preliminary figures show incidents of international terrorism
declined by about 25 percent last year from the 1988 total of 856,
according to the official.
   The figures to be released in the State Department's annual
report on terrorism next month also show a decline of about 27
percent in the number of fatalities from terrorist acts _ from 660
to 485. Exact numbers on overall incidents were not available.
   Counterterrorism experts attribute the 1989 decline to better
airport security, more commitment by governments to bring suspected
terrorists to trial and a drop in violent activities of Palestinian
groups.
   Fatah, the largest faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, has kept a pledge leader Yasser Arafat made in
December 1988 to refrain from terrorist attacks, said the U.S.
official, who predicted Fatah would continue that promise.
   Two groups that may not remain as inactive as they were in 1989
are the Fatah Revolutionary Council headed by Abu Nidal and the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Commanded led
by Ahmed Jebril.
   Abu Nidal's group has been paralyzed by a revolt that led the
Libyan-based leader to order dozens of followers killed over the
past two years, PLO sources say. However, experts agree the group
still poses a threat and that some Abu Nidal operatives have joined
the Syrian-based PFLP-GC.
   FBI and intelligence officials believe the PFLP-GC carried out
the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Scotland that
killed 270 people. However, the U.S. official said evidence
collected in the multinational police investigation isn't
sufficient to bring charges.
   Jebril is thought to have carried out the Pan Am attack under
contract with Iran, which has been accused of sponsoring dozens of
terrorist attacks around the world.
   Iranian-sponsored terrorism has increased in the six months
since the death of revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The State Department issued a warning earlier this month that
pro-Iranian extremists could be planning an attack against
Americans in Europe to coincide with the 11th anniversary of the
Islamic revolution that brought Khomeini to power.

<HEAD>Scientists Caution of Possible Climate Disruption</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: El Nino is pronounced el-NEEN-yo</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government scientists say changing water
temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean may be signaling the
start of a new El Nino that could cause powerful climate changes
worldwide.
   Current conditions resemble those of 1986, a relatively mild
version of El Nino, which has caused widespread devastating weather
in the past.
   ``The current situation deserves very close attention,'' the
federal Climate Analysis Center said in a statement Friday.
   The El Nino in 1982-83 led to weather changes that were blamed
for 1,500 deaths and billions of dollars in damage across the globe.
   ``We don't want to say something is developing that could be
like that, because that was exceptional,'' Dr. Vernon Kousky of the
climate center said in a telephone interview.
   The 1982-83 El Nino was blamed for worsening the devastating
drought in Africa, causing severe winter storms to come ashore in
California, spawning the first typhoon to strike French Polynesia
in 75 years _ followed by five more in five months _ deluging Peru
and Ecuador with torrential rains and promoting the worst drought
in two centuries in Australia.
   The United Nations estimated overall damage at between $2
billion and $8 billion.
   Scientists suggest that was a once-in-a-lifetime event, however.
The El Nino in 1986-87 was closer to average, bringing some weather
changes but not the massive damage of the earlier event.
   Formally called El Nino-Southern Oscillations, or ENSOs, these
events are characterized by unusually warm water conditions in the
eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and by changes in air pressure over
different parts of that ocean.
   Water temperatures near the international dateline have risen 1
and 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. While that may seem small,
the great amount of energy needed to warm such a large mass of
water can make it a significant increase.
   Years ago, when such changes tended to be first noticed by South
American fishermen around Christmas, the phenomenon was given the
name El Nino, which is Spanish for child, a reference to the baby
Jesus.
   Current conditions are similar to those prior to the 1986 event,
said Kousky. But, he added, ``I can't really say how firm it looks.
... There is nothing to say this will hang in there tough and
continue on. We're just monitoring it carefully.''
   If it does build into a full-fledged El Nino, the impact could
be felt worldwide.
   The problem is relocating warm water from one side of the
Pacific Ocean to the other.
   Normal conditions include strong easterly winds, which move the
warm surface waters of the ocean toward Asia and allow cooler
waters to rise up from the depths along the coast of South America.
   But when an ENSO occurs the easterly winds diminish or are
replaced by westerlies, and the warm water sloshes back toward the
Americas.
   That puts more rain and cloudiness in the central Pacific, where
it normally isn't, said Kousky, and the heating strengthens the jet
stream and upsets the normal wave patterns.
   A disruption in the normal jet stream can cause changes in
weather almost anywhere on the globe.
   El Ninos have been recorded periodically for many years.
Evidence of the effects of El Ninos can be traced, in fact, back to
1532 when an unusually wet season apparently helped Pizarro and his
Conquistadores cross normally desert areas in what is now Peru.

   The International Press Institute said it
protested to the government of Nepal over the reported seizure of
editions of two weekly newspapers reporting on a campaign for
democracy.
   ``We strongly urge that journalists in Nepal be allowed to
pursue their profession without further harassment, fear and
intimidation,'' Peter Galliner, the institute's director, wrote in
a letter released Friday.
   The letter to Nepal's home minister, Niranjan Thapa, said the
institute was concerned about reports that police on Tuesday seized
editions of the weeklies Saptahik Simarsha and Saptahik Nepali
Awaaj. The two newspapers gave extensive coverage to the campaign
for multiparty democracy in the Himalayan country, a constitutional
monarchy.
   These actions directly contravene international agreements such
as Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which
guarantees the right of journalists to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas through the news media regardless of
frontiers.
   The institute, which has offices in London and Zurich, is an
independent organization of nearly 2,000 leading publishers and
editors in more than 60 countries.

   A defense consultant described as a major
figure in the Pentagon procurement scandal will have to spend up to
27 months in prison and pay a $10,000 fine for participating in a
six-year scheme to bribe a government official.
   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton in Alexandria, Va.,
sentenced Thomas E. Muldoon on Friday to 27 months in prison and
also ordered him to serve three years of supervised probation
following his release from prison.
   Muldoon, 60, of Rockville, Md., was convicted in December of
participating in the conspiracy to funnel $80,000 in bribes to Jack
A. Sherman, a civilian Marine Corps contracting official.
   Muldoon, described by prosecutors as a major figure in the
Pentagon procurement scandal, received one of the longer sentences
in the long-running investigation that has been nicknamed
``Operation Ill Wind.''
   He could have received a 70-year prison sentence and fined up to
$1.04 million for eight convictions of conspiracy, bribery,
interstate travel in the aid of racketeering and false claims.
   A jury found Muldoon guilty of funneling the bribes to Sherman
through two defense consultants for Lee Telecommunications and the
Whittaker Corp. subsidiary that took over the company in 1986.
   Sherman, who is serving an 18-month term, testified that he
arranged to receive the bribes in return for helping Lee obtain
lucrative Marine Corps electronics contracts. Sherman testified
that he received $25,000 from Muldoon. Two other defense
consultants also served as conduits for the bribes, according to
testimony.

   A strong earthquake hit Japan's southern islands
today but no injuries were reported, the Central Meteorological
Agency said.
   The agency said the quake had a preliminary reading of 6.3 on
the Richter scale and was centered 12 miles under the seabed off
the coast of Amami Oshima island, 940 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   The quake was also felt on Yakushima and Tenegashima islands,
625 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   There was no danger of tidal waves nor any reports of death,
injury or damages, according to the agency.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy an earthquake
releases. Each increase of one number on the scale means the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   On the Richter scale, a six can cause severe damage in populated
areas. A seven is a ``major'' quake, capable of widespread heavy
damage.

   Thirty-four judges forced out for
political reasons during the 1981 martial-law crackdown regained
their old jobs and President Wojciech Jaruzelski apologized for
their firings, TV news reported.
   It said the provincial judges were sworn in Friday by
Jaruzelski, who declared martial law to suppress the independent
Solidarity movement.
   Throughout Poland, judges, journalists, professors, doctors and
others suspected of sympathizing with the opposition were fired.
Others resigned rather than undergo a ``verification'' of their
loyalty to Communist authorities in the Dec. 13, 1981 crackdown.
   After Solidarity was legalized and the non-Communist government
led by Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki took power last year,
formal efforts began to re-hire some of those who lost their
professions.
   ``There is a feeling of satisfaction, but there is also a
feeling of the old bitterness remaining,'' Judge Tadeusz Pokrzywa
told the main evening TV news program after he was sworn back in.
   Jaruzelski, who been increasingly accepting blame for martial
law and its failure to restore Poland's economic and social
stability, apologized to the judges at the ceremony.
   ``The president's apology made today in this room had a great
impression on me,'' said Pokrzywa, from the southeastern province
of Rzeszow. ``In connection ith that, I accept it with full
satisfaction.''

<BYLINE>African Monkey Linked to Branch of AIDS Epidemic
^By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A disease closely related to the AIDS virus
can almost certainly be traced back to an African monkey, which may
have given it to people by biting them, a researcher said.
   Dr. Vanessa M. Hirsch of Georgetown University said Friday the
West African epidemic of HIV-2 disease most likely comes from the
sooty mangabey, a nondescript charcoal-gray monkey that is now
endangered.
   The virus causes no outward signs of disease in the monkeys. But
when humans contract the disease, it causes a serious illness that
is similar to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, although less
fatal.
   Hirsch said she believes HIV-2 was transmitted from monkeys to
people within the past century through a bite or some other close
contact.
   HIV-2 is in the same family of viruses as HIV-1, the virus
responsible for the AIDS epidemic elsewhere in Africa as well as
Europe and the United States.
   Many kinds of African monkeys naturally harbor relatives of the
human AIDS virus. And while the chances of transmission from
animals to people are slim, this likely has happened in the past
and could occur again.
   Hirsch presented her findings Friday at a meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Many experts believe that HIV-1 spread from animals to people,
as well. According to one theory, it moved into a small,
geographically isolated pocket of humans in Africa; the disease
became epidemic only in recent years when those people moved to
cities.
   ``The evidence is highly suggestive of transmission from monkeys
to man of HIV-2,'' said Dr. Louis N. Martin of the Delta Regional
Primate Research Center at Tulane University. ``But where did HIV-1
come from? We don't know.''
   Hirsch said there are two reasons to think that HIV-2 came from
sooty mangabeys. The monkey virus and HIV-2 are about 75 percent
alike, and the monkeys live in the same area where HIV-2 is rampant.
   She said the animals are quick to bite, and people in West
Africa keep them as pets and for food.
   ``I would say it's very dangerous to own any kind of African
primate,'' Hirsch said.
   She said the sooty mangabey virus also was probably the cause of
an AIDS-like illness in macaque monkeys in the United States.
Macaques are Asian monkeys and do not naturally harbor their own
relative of the AIDS virus.
   A virus known as SIV, or simian immunodeficiency virus, was
first isolated at the New England Regional Primate Center in 1985,
and it has become an important stand-in for studying human AIDS.
   Macaques that catch this virus quickly grow sick and die. They
are now used as models to test possible ways to treat or prevent
AIDS in people.
   For instance, researchers at the New England primate center have
found evidence that a potential medicine known as CD4, which is
intended to draw the virus away from its usual targets in the
bloodstream, appears to wipe out the virus in monkeys. Preliminary
studies of this approach are now being conducted in people.
   Other researchers at the Delta primate center have found that
vaccines made from killed monkey virus may be effective in
protecting animals from infection with the virus. Experts say this
work is among the most promising signs yet that an AIDS vaccine for
people is possible.

<HEAD>Despite Praise, Some Questions Linger About Drug Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid the applause for President Bush's role at
the Colombia drug summit, questions linger over the meeting's
achievements and the deliberate avoidance of areas of dispute.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
praised Bush on Friday for ``his courage and leadership,'' but
called the president's drug policies misdirected and geared too
much toward military assistance.
   ``This continues our policy of attacking the drug traffickers
but doing too little to stop coca growing by farmers, which is the
root problem,'' Biden said.
   He said the United States should focus on crop development,
economic assistance, debt relief and trade policies that do not
undermine legitimate exports such as coffee and flowers.
   The summit communique signed Thursday by Bush and the leaders of
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru proclaimed sweeping goals, such as
replacing coca-growing economies, attacking the production and
trafficking of drugs and reducing the demand by users.
   The document didn't say how those goals would be achieved,
however, and controversial subjects such as the extradition of drug
suspects and increased U.S. military involvement in the drug war
were largely ignored.
   There also was no discussion of any specific amount of increased
aid from the United States, though the Andean nations clearly want
more assistance and relaxed trade policies.
   National drug policy director William Bennett said many of the
blanks would be filled in during negotiations with the summit
countries.
   ``I'm not saying we won't have more difficulties from here on.
We will,'' he said. Still, he said the summit had been of
``transcendent importance.''
   ``It was the first time the four countries faced up to all the
problems,'' Bennett said, calling it important for the South
American leaders to talk about the ``moral dimensions'' of a coca
economy.
   Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson called it ``a
meeting in which nobody talked in stereotypes or cliches.'' Bennett
said there was ``a lot of good-natured sparring.''
   Bush gave no hint he would beef up the $2.2 billion, five-year
Andean aid program already on the table.
   ``We're going to stay with that figure for now,'' the president
said Thursday before returning to Washington.
   Bush's attendance provided a dramatic gesture of support for
Barco and his unrelenting battle against the drug lords.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, called Bush on Friday to
congratulate him.
   Rangel said it was ``a significant first step in the global
effort to control the drug trade'' and the communique provided ``a
valuable framework for future cooperative efforts.''
   Rangel, whose committee will hold a hearing Feb. 28 about the
summit outcome, made clear he believes the administration has a
long way to go.
   ``I hope your entire Cabinet will become energized by your
historic mission,'' Rangel said in a letter to Bush. ``The heads of
the executive departments must develop the kinds of creative
strategies that will be necessary'' to reduce the demand for drugs.

   She's young, she's white, she parties, she
thinks tractor pulls are cool.
   She's just what the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. is looking for.
   A marketing plan to test a new brand of cigarettes called
``Dakota'' targets women in the 18 to 20-year-old range who like to
watch ``Roseanne'' and evening soap operas on TV and aspire to
marry in their early twenties, according to a story published in
today's Washington Post.
   Until that trip to the church, this smoker is content to spend
her free time ``with her boyfriend doing whatever he is doing,''
according to The Post, which obtained the company's marketing
proposals for ``Dakota.''
   Reynolds, which plans to begin test marketing of the cigarette
in Houston in April, said the Dakota is not intended to be solely
for women.
   ``Different products are designed to different categories of
consumers,'' the company said in a statement. ``Dakota is no
different. It is not a male brand or a female brand.''
   The marketing studies say Dakota is designed to ``replace
Marlboro as the brand of choice among female smokers 18-24.''
   Marlboro is produced by Philip Morris Companies Inc. A man on a

   The Post reported Reynolds confirmed its plans to test market
the cigarettes but got testy when asked about the marketing study.
   ``Reynolds does not know what these documents contain,'' the
company said in a statement. ``Reynolds does not know if they are
authentic or fabricated. ... If they are authentic, they represent
stolen, proprietary information belonging to R.J. Reynolds and
which would be of great value to our competitors.''
   The company already has had plans for a new brand of cigarette
go up in smoke this year, when public uproar led Reynolds to
abandon introduction of ``Uptown,'' which was targeted at blacks.
   The marketing plan obtained by the Post draws this profile of
the preferred Dakota smoker:
   _Education: High school, but no more.
   _Employment: ``Work is a job, not a career.''
   _Interests: ``Partying with friends; dancing, going to clubs and
bars; cruising; watching television; shopping at the mall.''
   _Live Entertainment: ``Drag races; motocross, motorcycle races;
hot rod shows; cycle shows; tractor pulls, monster trucks;
wrestling, tough man competitions.''

   The reputed leader of the Medellin drug
cartel was indicted by a statewide grand jury on cocaine-smuggling
charges, but authorities concede that bringing him to justice won't
be easy.
   Pablo Escobar Gaviria, last reported at large in Colombia, was
indicted Friday with 13 others on charges they helped smuggle more
than 8,000 pounds of cocaine through Florida.
   Escobar already faces federal drug charges in Miami, where he is
one of 15 co-defendants of Manuel Noriega, and in Jacksonville.
   ``What expectation does ... the state of Florida have of
prosecuting Pablo Escobar in this country? I just don't know what
the odds would be at this point,'' Florida Department of Law
Enforcement agent Manuel Pondakos said Friday.
   ``But it's not a lost hope,'' he said. ``I think we can get our
hands on him and he'll be brought back here.''
   Agents said the nine-count racketeering and conspiracy
indictment returned Friday is the culmination of a 15-month
investigation. The cocaine was said to be worth $82 million.
   Another major defendant arrested Friday is James M. Timonere, a
Tarpon Springs attorney. Agents alleged he was ``soldier in the
Colombian drug organization,'' helping to hide profits from drugs
smuggled into the St. Petersburg area and shipped to New York and
other large cities.
   ``He also leased motor vehicles and laundered money for the
organization,'' Florida agent Connie Smith-Patrick alleged of
Timonere. ``He also stored cocaine.''
   Timonere was in the Pinellas County jail Friday night on
$250,000 bond. Other defendants included U.S. citizens from
Florida, Alabama and Arizona, and foreign nationals from Colombia
and Belize.
   Authorities have also seized more than $1.6-million worth of
property, including boats, cars, homes and cash, as part of their
investigation.
   The state indictment only adds to the federal charges Escobar
already faces.
   Escobar was named in the 1988 federal drug-trafficking
indictment that led to the arrest of Noriega. That indictment
accused Escobar, as head of the cartel, with bribing Noriega to
turn Panama into a transit and processing point for Colombian
cocaine.
   In March 1989, a federal grand jury in Jacksonville, based on
testimony in the trial of Carlos Lehder Rivas, indicted Escobar and
other cartel leaders for drug smuggling and for organizing the
assassination of Colombian Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla on
April 29, 1984. The indictment also said Escobar and Fabio Ochoa
Vasquez directed the Feb. 19, 1986, slaying of former Drug
Enforcement Administration informant Barry Seal.
   Escobar and other alleged cartel leaders, including Jorge Ochoa
Vasquez, were also named in a sweeping August 1986 indictment in
Miami which laid out the organization's operations.

   The head of a delegation of Soviet lawmakers
says his group is satisfied with its access to U.S. military bases
and that the Soviet Union will be more forthcoming when Americans
return the visit.
   Vladimir L. Lapygin, a member of the Supreme Soviet Presidium,
spoke at a news conference Friday after meeting with the House
Armed Services Committee to discuss ways to assure a smooth
transition to a more peaceful coexistence.
   ``Let's decide about some specific issue to get from words to
deeds,'' Lapygin told committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis.
   The 10-member group, on a 12-day tour, has visited military
bases, Los Alamos National Laboratories, NORAD, a Minuteman II
missile site and the Strategic Air Command in Nebraska.
   Today the group was to visit the Tactical Air Command at Langley
Air Force Base in Virginia and an Army chemical weapon facility at
Fort McClellan, Ala. On Sunday, they planned to visit the Kennedy
Space Center and Walt Disney World in Florida.
   Lapygin said some troop levels must be maintained despite mutual
concerns about how to ease the return of soldiers to civilian life
and convert war industries to peacetime use.
   Aspin mentioned some areas of possible cooperation, including
the conversion of industries and precautions against the accidental
launch of missiles.

   The Interstate Commerce Commission has voted
unanimously to continue service on the ailing Delaware &amp; Hudson
Railway for another week while a bankruptcy trustee tries to
negotiate the sale of the nation's oldest continually operated
railroad.
   ``I think we're all of one mind that the service should be
maintained,'' ICC Chairman Edward J. Philbin said at a hearing
Friday.
   The ICC voted 4-0, with one commissioner absent, to allow three
railroads to run on D&amp;H tracks: the New York, Susquehanna &amp;
Western, which operates the D&amp;H under earlier ICC orders;
Lackawanna Valley Railroad Corp.; and North Shore Railroad Co.
   Under the plan, the railroads will be subsidized by the states
of New York and Pennsylvania; two shippers; two Canadian railroads;
and a third unidentified railroad, said Charles H. White Jr.,
counsel for the bankruptcy trustee.
   He identified the shippers as General Electric Corp. and
International Paper Co. The two Canadian railroads, Canadian
National and Canadian Pacific, are interested in buying the D&amp;H.
   White estimated the subsidies would amount to $500,000 or more a
month.
   The D&amp;H in June 1988 filed for court protection from its
creditors under the federal bankruptcy laws. The line has debts of
about $100 million.

   Progress on a Chinese application to join an
international group aimed at expanding world trade has been slowed
because of questions about China's commitment to economic reforms,
the State Department says.
   It said Friday that a number of members of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), including the United States, have
expressed concern about measures China has taken ``which restrict
market access and are incompatible with GATT principles.''
   ``We believe these questions need to be adequately addressed
before further action is possible on China's application,'' the
department said in a written response to press questions.
   At the same time, State said it was looking forward to the
eventual inclusion of Taiwan in GATT's membership because of the
island's importance in the global trading system.
   The department added that the United States has maintained a
consistent policy on GATT membership for both China and Taiwan over
the years.
   ``We have told both parties that we want eventual access for
both on meaningful terms agreed upon by GATT members,'' it said.

Spence said Friday. ``How do you think Mrs. Reagan would feel?''
   Spence made his remarks after a federal court hearing on the

from the Philippine treasury to buy art and Manhattan real estate.
They also were charged with defrauding banks of $165 million in
loans. Marcos died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28 at age 72.
   Spence of Jackson Hole, Wyo., who had represented the family of

   A disease closely related to the AIDS virus
can almost certainly be traced back to an African monkey, which may
have given it to people by biting them, a researcher said.
   Dr. Vanessa M. Hirsch of Georgetown University said Friday the
West African epidemic of HIV-2 disease most likely comes from the
sooty mangabey, a nondescript charcoal-gray monkey that is now
endangered.
   The virus causes no outward signs of disease in the monkeys. But
when humans contract the disease, it causes a serious illness that
is similar to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, although less
fatal.
   Hirsch said she believes HIV-2 was transmitted from monkeys to
people within the past century through a bite or some other close
contact.

   Hal Rosenbluth's 51st-story office looks
down over City Hall, far away from the dusty, brown North Dakota
prairie. But he thinks the two fit together.
   The 37-year-old chief executive got interested in North Dakota
when he decided to help its drought-stricken farmers. Now he's
become a fan of the state, and his friendship has led to a thriving
business and the promise of more to come.
   Rosenbluth Travel is the nation's fourth-largest travel agency,
a 98-year-old business that writes airline tickets for corporate
giants ranging from Eastman Kodak to General Electric.
   But Rosenbluth's idea of a great vacation is someplace where
you're overdressed if you wear anything other than a T-shirt with a
stain on it.
   ``He is a very down-to-earth, non-pretentious person,'' says
Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.
   The two men and their wives struck up a friendship after
Rosenbluth opened a data-processing office in Linton, N.D., in
1988, when drought threatened to drive many families there off the
farm. They have united in a promotion and recruitment effort they
say could spur several Rosenbluth clients to open new businesses in
North Dakota.
   ``It's so genuine, It's so refreshing, pure,'' Rosenbluth said
during a recent interview in his office. ``I had never carried on a
conversation for more than 15 minutes, I think, until I went out
there.''
   Folks in Linton, a town of about 1,000 in central North Dakota,
find it easy to talk to Rosenbluth.
   ``Before our first meeting I was nervous,'' said Sharon Jangula,
the coordinator for Rosenbluth's data-processing office. ``I really
didn't know what to expect, a stuffed shirt, hard to talk to,
strictly business type person. I was really surprised.''
   Rosenbluth's 2,300 employees are called ``associates.''
   To become one, you must be ``nice'' _ friendly, outgoing and
willing to provide demanding clients with ``elegant service.''
   Managers are taught that a good supervisor is a good servant.
Each new employee at any of the agency's 265 offices round the
world is brought to Philadelphia for seminars that end with tea in
the board room. Rosenbluth and other managers serve the tea and
cakes.
   Associates are encouraged to think of ways to improve the
company's service. One employee's suggestion led to Rosenbluth
Travel's new telecommunications service for the deaf.
   ``That's one of the few ways you get dismissed is if someone
suppresses an idea,'' Rosenbluth said.
   His management style may sound corny or impractical, but you
can't argue with success.
   Rosenbluth went to work for the company in 1974 after earning a
degree in criminology from the University of Miami. The former
steamship ticket office his great-grandfather opened in 1892 had
$20 million in billings.
   Bored as a vice president, Rosenbluth left the front office
after a year to work as a reservation agent. His management ideas
were born in after-hours talks with the other agents.
   By 1975, Rosenbluth's billings had grown to $300 million. They
hit $1.1 billion last month and are still growing, the company says.
   Out of its success came a social conscience.
   The agency contributed to Philadelphia charities, but the sight
in 1988 of struggling farmers and parched Midwest fields on the
television news sparked something in Rosenbluth's imagination.
   Determined to help, he contacted U.S. Agriculture Department
officials to find out what area was hit hardest. They pointed him
to North Dakota, and state officials pointed him to Linton.
   The company rented space in a tractor dealership and hired 40
part-time employees to punch information into the company's
computer at $5 an hour. To some farm wives, Rosenbluth's jobs were
the difference between losing the farm or taking a job an hour away
in Bismarck.
   He expected costs in North Dakota to be less, although he
insists he never considered the potential savings. Wages alone are
20 percent to 25 percent less than in Philadelphia.
   He found a strong work ethic, practically no turnover and ``nice
people'' that fit his corporate style.
   ``I said to myself, this is something we need to wake up to,''
Rosenbluth said.

<HEAD>Restructuring Your Way to a Higher Stock Price</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the expansionist 1980s behind most U.S.
companies and the leaner and more conservative '90s under way,
corporate restructuring may well become more popular as a way to
increase the price of a firm's stock.
   Junk bond financing is just about on hold and fewer takeovers
are getting done, so it's harder for companies to boost their stock
prices by making acquisitions. But buying back shares, divesting
underperforming units or taking other restructuring steps is an
easier and sometimes cheaper alternative.
   When Marriott Corp. announced in December it was restructuring
by selling most of its restaurants and buying back more stock,
company officials said enhancing shareholder value _ Wall Street's
catchword for raising the firm's stock price _ was among their
goals.
   It doesn't always work, and when it does, it can take time. The
day the Marriott restructuring was announced, the company's stock
fell $1 a share to $33.62{.
   Marriott's shares have traded lower since then, but the company
has been subject to the same doldrums that have eroded prices for
most issues on Wall Street this year.
   Investors were more enthused when International Business
Machines Corp. announced a $1 billion stock buyback in October.
They immediately bid the computer giant's shares up $2.37{ to
$104.12{. IBM is currently trading at about that level.
   How much a restructuring affects a company's stock price depends
on a number of factors, including the kind of move undertaken, how
much money is involved and whether the shares themselves are
directly involved, as in a buyback. Conditions on Wall Street are
also a variable.
   There is nothing new about restructurings, but analysts have
predicted there will be more of them in the coming months and years
now that the takeover boom has ended.
   Companies are now working from within, rearranging and
streamlining their businesses, trying to improve their profits and,
consequently, the price of stock. If they decide to repurchase
stock, the price often goes up under the law of supply and demand.
   But some firms are forced into restructuring by the threat of
hostile takeover attempts. The buyout binge may be over, but a few
companies have become the targets of investors who want a better
return on their holdings _ in other words, a higher stock price.
   Georgia Gulf Corp. had to formulate a recapitalization plan to
try to fend off Texas investor Harold Simmons, who holds about 9
percent of the chemical company's stock. Simmons began playing a
cat-and-mouse game with Georgia Gulf last summer, presenting
management with a list of suggestions on how to raise their share
price.
   The company says its recapitalization plan, which provides for a
cash payment to stockholders, is worth up to $55 a share. Simmons,
dissatisfied with the recapitalization, has launched a $1.1 billion
_ at $45 a share _ hostile bid and wants to unseat the Georgia Gulf
board.
   The company's stock is currently trading below Simmons' bid.
   Simmons' strategy _ considered corporate raiding in some
quarters _ is similar to the approach Carl Icahn used at Texaco
Inc. starting in late 1987. Icahn, then Texaco's biggest
shareholder, fought the oil company's management for more than a
year, charging they were not doing enough to raise its stock price.
   Icahn proposed a takeover bid and tried unsuccessfully to unseat
Texaco's board. The oil giant ended up with a major restructuring
that included the sale of billions of dollars worth of assets and
the payment of a special dividend to stockholders.
   Now Icahn is the largest shareholder at USX Corp., and is
expected to rock the boat there, too.

<HEAD>Stock Prices Say `What Recession?'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the economy is headed for a period of pain
and retrenchment, some stubborn optimists in the stock market
evidently haven't gotten the word.
   Over the first seven weeks of 1990, the financial news has been
almost unrelentingly negative _ recession forecasts, a sudden rise
in interest rates, and the dramatic failure of a prominent Wall
Street firm.
   The stock market joined in the gloomy chorus last month with a
selloff that chilled followers of the ``January barometer,'' which
is supposed to signal the likely course of stock prices over the
rest of the year.
   But with all those excuses to lose its nerve, the market has
lately rebounded instead, and now stands only about 6 percent below
the record high it reached as the new year began.
   The latest demonstration of the markets' resiliency came this
past week, when barely a ripple of selling followed news of the
collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the firm that reigned as
``junk-bond'' king through most of the 1980s.
   That was hardly the only instance. Analysts also note that the
market has been faced with a barrage of increasingly downbeat
appraisals of the business outlook.
   For example, Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber Inc., this
month said he believed the odds of a recession had increased to
about two in five, or 40 percent, from one in three previously.
   At about the same time, the economists S. Jay Levy and David
Levy in Chappaqua, N.Y. increased their recession-probability
rating from 50 percent to 60 percent.
   Among other factors, both cited the surprise jump in interest
rates, which has added to an already worrisome list of credit
problems facing business planners and consumers.
   Said the Levys: ``The economy has financial vulnerabilities that
are now just beginning to impact nonfinancial economic activity.
   ``Overindebtedness has reduced, or ended, business at a number
of retail firms. Construction companies are building fewer houses
because they cannot obtain financing. Financial institutions'
willingness to fund real estate development is diminishing, the
result of lately having been burned too many times.''
   The stock market, however, is not making the kind of recession
forecast it has made in advance of many past business slumps. The
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 12.61 at 2,635.59 in the
past week, remains just a decent rally's distance shy of its Jan. 2
peak of 2,810.15.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index down .64 at 183.75; the NASDAQ composite index for
the over-the-counter market up .17 at 429.01, and the American
Stock Exchange market value index off 2.02 at 358.77.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 148.57 million shares a day,
against 154.98 million the week before.
   Attempts to explain the stock market's steady showing generally
fall into two categories. On one side, there's the bullish view
that investors, in the aggregate a traditionally knowledgeable
group, can see beyond any short-term economic weakness to better
days ahead.
   In the other camp are those who believe stock traders are
missing the usual signs of trouble, their vision obscured by the
long bull market of the '80s.
   To some of this persuasion, the problem was only worsened by
Drexel Burnham's demise and the markets' unruffled response to it.
   As junk bonds full further from favor and credit worries mount,
these observers say, stocks are less and less likely to get support
from takeover news and speculation.
   Even before the Drexel news broke, analyst Greg Smith at
Prudential-Bache Securities observed, ``the stock market continues
to react to takeover stories as though little has changed. I would
like to see market reactions that indicate investors understand the
takeover binge has been severely diminished as a positive stock
market influence.''

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Courts Playing Increased Role in American Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bankruptcy once conjured up images of outraged
creditors plundering what's left of businesses that can't pay the
bills, a notion rooted in medieval Europe.
   In late 20th century America, however, bankruptcy has taken on
an entirely new meaning as a protective remedy that allows troubled
companies to keep operating while they work out their financial
problems under a judge's supervision.
   Bankruptcy itself has become a huge business, fed in part by
failures such as that of financial giants Drexel Burnham Lambert
and Integrated Resources Inc. this past week.
   The latest names join a long list of other big business that
have recently found refuge in the bankruptcy court system,
including Eastern Airlines and the Campeau Corp. retailing empire.
   Such moves have placed an extraordinary amount of power in the
hands of judges, entrusted with the fates of companies that employ
hundreds of thousands of people and owe billions in debts.
   More money passes through bankruptcy courts than all other
courts combined, bankruptcy attorneys say. Figures compiled by the
American Bankruptcy Institute, a Washington group of attorneys,
show the number of bankruptcy filings nearly doubled to 643,000
last year compared with five years earlier.
   Most filings represent sincere attempts by businesses in
financial trouble to delay or stretch out repayment of onerous
debts under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, which gives
companies a respite from creditors while they restructure and
attempt to rehabilitate themselves.
   The code was liberalized in 1978, partly to give businesses more
flexibility in turning to the Chapter 11 strategy. Attorneys trace
the bankruptcy boom to that reform, which in many cases has been
exploited by large, financially solvent companies facing potential
ruin, not necessarily because of pressure from lenders.
   Texaco Inc., for example, resorted to Chapter 11 three years
ago, not from heavy losses in its oil business, but because of a
$10.5 billion court judgment awarded to smaller rival Pennzoil Co.
   Manville Corp. and A.H. Robins Co. exited bankruptcy court in
1989 as healthy companies after years under Chapter 11 protection
because of product-liability lawsuits that they claimed threatened
their existence.
   ``Chapter 11 as it's now functioning is proving to be a fairly
hospitable resort for big companies,'' said Frank Kennedy, a
University of Michigan professor and noted authority on bankruptcy
law. ``Other countries don't have anything like rehabilitiation.
Our bankruptcy laws are unique in providing hospitality.''
   Many business veterans have found American bankruptcy law to be
a lifeline in squalls of financial trouble. Sanford Sigoloff, an
executive known as a turnaround artist for helping steer building
products retailer Wickes Cos. through a sucessful bankruptcy five
years ago, is one of the system's most articulate defenders.
   ``There are lots of Chapter 11s in this country and a large
percentage of them meet all or part of their obligations over time
and come back,'' said Sigoloff. ``The system, when used as
designed, is outstanding.''
   Bankruptcy stems from the Italian ``bancorotto'' or ``broken
bench.'' In medieval Italy, where skilled craftsmen did business
from benches in guild halls, those who defaulted on debts faced the
wrath of suppliers, who would smash the bench and rifle the
craftsmen's tools as partial compensation.
   Protection against bankruptcy is largely an American legal
innovation, based on the theory that if businesses had a reprieve
from sudden shortages of cash or credit, for whatever reason, they
and the country would ultimately benefit because jobs would be
saved and the economy would continue to grow.
   ``For the businessman, it's a time to renew the company,''
Sigoloff said. ``For the creditors, it's an opportunity to have a
common forum and return the company to health.''
   In Drexel's case, however, the Chapter 11 filing appeared to be
largely a formality to briefly prolong the life of the company,
which had been devastated by legal problems and a depression in the
market for its main business, high-risk junk bonds.
   Many legal experts say the Drexel case illustrates another side
to the U.S. bankruptcy law _ that it is not a magic bullet for
resurrection.
   Without public trust or a marketable product, both of which
Drexel quickly and dramatically lost, bankruptcy court becomes a
trough where the scraps of a business are thrown, to be distributed
among its many creditors.
   ``That's the kind of business so tied to confidence that it's
difficult to reorganize,'' said Harry Dixon, an Omaha lawyer who
chairs the American Bankruptcy Institute. ``Any company that has
that problem, Chapter 11 won't solve.''
   In other business news this past week:
   _The government said a 30 percent trade-balance improvement in
December helped the United States narrow the deficit to $108.6
billion, the smallest in five years. But private economists said
the figure masked a troubling surge in dependence on foreign oil
and other products this year that could dramatically widen the
deficit, the most visible symbol of U.S. economic weakness.
   _Big Three carmakers reported a severe plunge in 1989 earnings
because of costly incentives to woo buyers and a depression in the
auto industry. Workers at General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
got sharply reduced profit-sharing bonuses. Chrysler's workers gone
none.
   _Perrier recalled its famous sparkling water worldwide after
traces of cancer-causing benzene were found in some shipments. The
French company, which traced the contamination to a dirty filter,
faces multimillion-dollar losses, potentially huge liability claims
and an embarassing humiliation over a product it had peddled as
pure from the source.

<HEAD>With All the Bad News About Junk Bonds, Maybe Now Is a Good Time
to Buy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just when it looked like things couldn't get any
worse for the junk bond market, the house of Drexel came tumbling
down in a stunningly swift collapse.
   It was the kind of news that gets the pulse racing in some
vulture buyers and other long-term investors.
   The junk market has been reeling for months from defaults,
credit downgrades of benchmark issues, requirements that ailing
thrifts sell their holdings and a virtual boycott by mutual funds
and others.
   Then last week's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by the parent of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. removed the firm that built the $200
billion market virtually from scratch.
   For many, it was a fitting comeuppance for the cocky investment
bank and its paper prodigy, which promised such riches that many
buyers seemed to forget why the bonds were called ``junk.''
   But a number of stout-hearted money managers who invest for the
long haul rather than the quick turn believe there are juicy
pickings in the junk pile.
   ``If nothing else, the Drexel bankruptcy has created an
opportunity for people that can truly analyze the creditworthiness
of the individual bonds and can determine those that are junk and
those that aren't junk,'' says Steven Case, senior consultant at
Berg Fiduciary Consultants.
   Junk bulls caution that the market is likely to remain shaky for
months as buyers remain scarce and hard-pressed investors _
everyone from thrifts to what remains of Drexel itself _ sell their
holdings. The heady enthusiasm for double-digit yields that
dominated the go-go years is out.
   But anyone willing to do a sober review of junk bond issuers _
checking cash-flow, the schedule of debt maturities coming due and
need for asset sales _can find good values.
   ``That is what's slowly taking place,'' says Dan Baldwin, who
manages close to $1 billion in high-yield assets at Chancellor
Capital Management in New York. ``It's going back to credit
fundamentals.''
   Baldwin and others say the negative publicity about the market
has obscured the fact that there are at least three levels of junk
out there.
   Roughly 35 percent of all junk bonds come from companies that
are operating profitably and are traded actively by a number of
securities firms, Baldwin says. Bonds issued by Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. and Kroger Co. _ the Cincinnati retailer that made good
_ yield around 12 percent, more than two percentage points above
investment-grade corporate bonds.
   A similar amount of bonds have been issued by companies that can
meet their interest payments, but few market makers deal in these
issues so liquidity is problematic, he says.
   At the bottom is the stress tier, perhaps 25 percent of the
market, where issuers are in default or unlikely to be able to meet
future debt payments, Baldwin says. Yields here can range from 16
percent to more than 30 percent, assuming interest actually is
paid, and paid in cash rather than more junk.
   ``The prices have gone down so low and yields are so attractive,
it's very attractive relative to equities,'' Baldwin says.
   Peter W. Thayer, president of Gateway Investment Advisers in
Cincinnati, is a long-time equity investor who shunned junk bonds
in the past but is giving the market another look.
   A buyer willing to wait two to four years for a return can
assemble a $20 million portfolio of bonds from a dozen companies,
Thayer says. At current prices, the investment should pay off
handsomely even if a few of the companies fail, he says.
   For the small investor, it isn't a bad time to put some money
into high-yield mutual funds because customer redemptions in the
wake of Drexel's bankruptcy filing may depress fund prices, Thayer
adds. ``You should just buy them and forget them for a few years.''
   For the real vulture, the market's current distress is like an
appetizing heap of corpses.
   David J. Breazzano, who manages about $100 million for T. Rowe
Price Associates of Baltimore, is interested only in true
``distressed credits,'' or companies that have filed for bankruptcy
protection. These bonds trade mostly for as little as 20 cents to
50 cents on the dollar.
   Few people deal in these bonds, though, so when an investor has
to sell, the price often drops fast.
   ``If somebody can absorb size, he can buy it below market,
substantially below,'' Breazzano says. The vulture buyer may have
to wait through two to three years of bankruptcy court proceedings,
but if he's done his homework on the company, he can be pretty sure
of a payback.
   As Breazzano says, ``Everything, even a bankrupt bond, has value
at a price.''

<HEAD>The MBA _ Still Considered `The Ticket'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Until last week, 23-year-old Jarl Ginsberg, was
an options trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   But when the company's parent filed for bankruptcy court
protection in the largest collapse of any Wall Street firm,
Ginsberg was forced to consider his alternatives.
   Getting a master's of business administration would give him
``credentials and credibility,'' and it would buy him time while
the industry limps back on its feet.
   The shine on the MBA degree, the yuppie ticket to bigger and
better things that has been coveted for more than a decade, has yet
to tarnish.
   Despite fresh and massive layoffs on Wall Street, businesspeople
and students alike still say the degree makes a difference.
   Business schools anticipate no drop in applications, though
students are shifting their studies away from risky investment
banking in favor of consulting and more traditional areas like
corporate finance.
   Many new MBAs have yet to chip away at the loans they took out
to foot the degree. A few are considering drastic career changes.
   One 30-year-old investment banker who graduated from Columbia
University's business school two years ago owes nearly $25,000 on
college loans. But job prospects have dimmed so astonishingly that
he is preparing to apply to law schools.
   ``Career paths within banking are fairly restricted now,'' he
said, speaking anonymously so he wouldn't officially violate his
company's ``don't-talk-to-the-press'' policy. ``It's time to look
beyond banking.''
   What drove hordes of people to the financial services industry
via business school was the promise of financial rewards that
practically knew no bounds.
   Recruiters visiting the Columbia campus a few years back were
offering starting salaries of $75,000 and ``the unspoken promise of
$250,000 five years out,'' one recent grad remembers.
   Today, financial companies are not even showing up to talk to
students, let alone offer them jobs. At New York Univeristy's Stern
School, ``all companies are cutting back and some are canceling
their schedules'' to interview for summer internships, said Howard
Leifman, assistant director of the school's office of career
development.
   At Columbia, director of placement and career services Elizabeth
Katsivelos said there haven't been any ``excessive cancellations.''
But she did note that more students are showing an interest in
consulting and manufacturing.
   In 1986, the go-go days of Wall Street, 31 percent of Columbia's
MBA grads went to brokerage houses and investment firms. Last year,
the number dwindled to 16 percent, and Katsivelos called further
declines possible.
   Some insiders predict only a mere 10 percent of the Drexel
people will actually land jobs in financial services in New York.
More than 5,000 Drexel employees were expected to lose their jobs.
   According to a study of recent MBA graduates from the
prestigious Wharton School in Philadelphia, those accepting jobs in
the Northeast have dropped more than 7 percent, while those moving
to the South jumped 56 percent.
   For those willing to pack it all in and move, many will find
themselves trapped by real estate they can't readily unload.
Cooperative apartments in Brooklyn Heights, which offers a
bird's-eye view of Wall Street, are either being deeply discounted
or taking months to sell.
   At the peak of the city's real estate boom a few years ago, a
modest, two-bedroom apartment sold for $225,000 in a less
fashionable Brooklyn neighborhood. Local realtors now tell the
owners they'll have to drop to about $190,000 if they want a quick
sale.
   ``You're stuck with property you've paid a lot of money for,''
one homeowner complained.
   For those who do manage to land on their feet, the question
becomes just how solid the foundation will be. Do they have any
chance of earning their previous salaries?
   One 28-year-old trader, who earned $100,000-plus at a Wall
Street firm, has been unemployed since September. His prospects are
even bleaker now that he's competing with another few thousand
Drexel jobless.
   Though he received a generous severance package, there's only
money left to cover living expenses for his family and the mortgage
on his designer duplex loft for another eight months.
   Then, of course, there's a certain amount of guilt to be dealt
with after riding the wave of greed and materialism. Some of Wall
Street's unfortunate said they were embarrassed they didn't see the
end coming.
   ``I feel responsible for not anticipating things better,'' said
one.

<HEAD>Multibillionaire Texan Takes Aim At Leading Newspaper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT LEISNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrew Barnes, head of the St.
Petersburg Times, bristles at a Texas tycoon's attempt to acquire a
prominent newspaper that was set up to be forever independent.
   ``What you're seeing is people who think everything can be
measured in dollars,'' says Barnes, 50, of a bid led by Fort Worth
billionaire Robert M. Bass to acquire control of the Times
Publishing Co., owner of the newspaper and the Congressional
Quarterly.
   A Bass-led partnership, which bought a minority stake in
mid-1988, offered $270 million for a controlling share, a deal
rejected Friday by trustees who control the company. The Bass
investors also are suing for a bigger share of dividends they claim
aren't fairly distributed.
   What paved the way for a takeover fight was a feud that started
long ago in the family of the late Times titan Nelson Poynter, who
ran the newspaper for 30 of its 105 years.
   Poynter engineered a unique way to keep a profitable daily
newspaper in the hands of journalists, free from control of
outsiders or even his family. He established a nonprofit journalism
school, the Poynter Institute, which through a complex system is
the major stockholder of the newspaper and receives 83 percent of
the dividends.
   In a special centennial issue in 1984 the Times said of its
ownership: ``As corny as it sounds, how one of ... America's
largest daily newspapers became the property of a school is the
story of one man's commitment to corporate excellence and local
control.
   ``Nelson Poynter's gift _ valued in the hundreds of millions of
dollars _ has been called both a noble gesture and a tax dodge.''
   Poynter carved family scars as he brought his dream to life. Ten
years after his death in 1978, disgruntled heirs said they felt
they weren't getting a fair share of the dividends. They sold their
minority interest to Bass and now are part of his Poynter-Jamison
Ventures Ltd. partnership.
   In its suit, the Bass group values the company at $450 million
and alleges management is cheating shareholders. Bass and his
partners own 40 percent of the common stock but only receive 5.7
percent of the company's dividends.
   Barnes, who won't disclose the company's worth, calls the suit
``meritless and wrong'' and vows to ``respond as forcefully as we
know how to do.
   ``They're accusing us of doing what we assert we do. They call
it a breach of fiduciary trust. This is a fight about dividend flow
and whether they get the 6 percent they bought or the 40 percent
they'd like,'' Barnes said.
   Both sides have been lining up high-powered attorneys for what
could be a long and bitter fight.
   Barnes believes an emphasis on profits would sacrifice
journalistic excellence.
   ``Journalism is our strength. We also have excellent lawyers,''
he said. ``I don't intend to lose.''
   The other side thinks economics and good journalism mix.
   Bass, 41, a renowned takeover dabbler with artful acquisitions
to his credit, wants the paper because it is widely respected and
financially sound, says spokesman David Bonderman.
   ``Barnes acts like it's the Holy Grail; that nobody could have
an interest in journalistic integrity if they had an economic
stake,'' Bonderman said. ``The only ones like that are the St. Pete
Times and Pravda. And even Pravda seems to be learning its lesson.''
   Barnes doesn't take kindly to the Soviet Communist Party
newspaper analogy.
   ``If they so value the journalistic aspect, how can they compare
us to Pravda?'' he asks.
   ``We're not talking about little old ladies,'' Barnes said.
``We're talking about corporate raiders from Texas. I think there's
an intimate relationship between good journalism and the dollars it
costs to provide it ... You can't have it both ways.''
   The Bass group has said it will guarantee editorial integrity of
the paper, and claims the buyout plan would strengthen the
institute financially.
   The newspaper Poynter envisioned wouldn't have to worry about
debt, or ownership by investors or a large newspaper chain that
could influence content. He centralized control of the newspaper in
the hands of one person by arranging for the institute shares to be
voted by the chief executive officer of the Times Publishing Co.
   That power went first to Times editor Eugene Patterson, who
picked Barnes as his successor when he retired in 1988. Barnes is
chairman of the institute, board chairman and chief executive
officer of both the Times Holding Co. and the Times Publishing Co.
and editor, president and chief executive of the newspaper.
   When Nelson Poynter took over the paper and its parent from his
father Paul in 1947, the stock was allocated with the idea that
Nelson would have voting control and his sister, Eleanor, would
have a greater income flow, said Merritt Gardner, an attorney who
represented her before her death in 1987.
   It didn't work out that way.
   Eventually, Nelson Poynter called in the redeemable, non-voting
stock Eleanor held, leaving his sister with 40 percent _ or 200
shares _ of voting stock and only 6 percent of the dividends.
   Poynter wound up with 60 percent of the voting stock _ or 300
shares _ and 3,000 shares of preferred stock he didn't redeem. That
gave him 94 percent of the dividends. Later, some shares went to
Poynter's widow, Marion, who receives about 11 percent of the
dividends.
   Voting stock provides power; non-voting stock brings dividends.
   The Bass group got its entree by buying the 200 shares of voting
stock owned by Poynter's nieces, Mary Alice Jamison Griffin and Ann
Poynter Jamison Parker. The sisters, daughters of Eleanor, said
they were forced to sell to settle estate taxes after their mother
died.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. gave thousands of
fired workers skimpy severance payments but offered cut-rate deals
on computer equipment as it headed into oblivion after reshaping
corporate America in the 1980s.
   The bulk of Drexel's 5,300 employees were turned loose Friday
into a slumping securities industry that already has witnessed tens
of thousands of layoffs since the 1987 stock market crash.
   Drexel's parent company filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law Tuesday when it
defaulted on some debt and banks refused to lend money. The company
then began liquidating its businesses, including the once-powerful
securities firm.
   ``It has been a historic week,'' said Kathleen Camilli, a Drexel
money market economist who is forming a research firm with a
co-worker. ``Just think, 10 years from now I'll look back and say I
worked for Drexel Burnham. And that firm no longer exists.''
   On Friday, Drexel workers finished packing boxes, unscrewed
computer equipment from desks to buy at fire-sale prices and left
the firm's downtwon headquarters, many for the last time.
   ``It's a beautiful day, isn't it?'' one Drexel executive said,
pointing to a drizzly, gray sky overhead. ``It's like the day King
Kong invaded Manhattan.''
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said an unspecified number of
employees _ from investment bankers to secretaries _ would remain
temporarily to finish pending business. Drexel is transferring some
business to other firms and liquidating its portfolio of junk bonds
and other securities.
   Under the severance plan, salaried workers are to get a week and
a half's pay for each year of completed service, plus two weeks'
pay. Unsalaried workers are to get just one week's pay per year,
plus one week, employees said. The maximum is 24 weeks' pay for 15
or more years at the firm.
   The payments are coming out of the securities firm's remaining
assets, which are not covered by the parent's bankruptcy filing.
   ``We deeply regret this short notice of termination to you, but
we made Herculean efforts to obtain additional capital, which we
believed would be available, and anticipated a refinancing of our
debt obligations as has been done in the past,'' the letter said.
``Unfortunately, this did not occur.
   ``With the filing of the petition in bankruptcy by our parent
company, a loss of confidence by the public, our investors and
customers has resulted in our inability to conduct our business and
compelled us to close down our operations.''
   The bulk of Drexel's high-yield bond division in Beverly Hills,
Calif., was fired. The operation long headed by Michael Milken was
largely responsible for the firm's rise to prominence.
   About 1,000 Drexel clients handled by Milken used the risky debt
securities to expand. Some used them to raise money for hostile
raids on much larger firms, a phenomenon that altered American
business in the 1980s.
   Drexel's demise was due in part to the collapse of the junk-bond
market last fall and to the firm's agreement to plead guilty to
securities crimes and pay $650 million to the government. Milken
left Drexel after he was indicted on related charges.
   Also Friday, officials confirmed that Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. was expected to acquire about 28,000 Drexel brokerage accounts
with assets of as much as $5 billion. The accounts are held by
current and former Drexel employees, their relatives and small
institutions.
   A Drexel junk-bond holder filed a class-action lawsuit charging
a Drexel controlling company, Milken, chief executive Frederick H.
Joseph and others with fraud, deceit, misrepresentation and
securities law violations in junk-bond deals.
   The lawsuit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, claims Milken
``lured in'' thousands of investors and then engaged in secret
transactions.
