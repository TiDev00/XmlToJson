   Fire raged through a subway tunnel under
construction near downtown Friday, collapsing a section near the
Hollywood Freeway and snarling traffic when the thoroughfare was
shut for fear it might also fall.
   Commuters were thrown into chaos, and firefighters and engineers
reported damage to the Metro Rail tunnel running under the freeway,
one of the principal routes linking Northern and Southern
California.
   ``Current information has part of the tunnel collapsed due to
failure of the metal rings binding the tunnel together,'' said city
Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon.
   By late afternoon, the blaze was ``confined and contained but
not out,'' fire spokesman Greg Acevedo said.
   ``The tunnel is 750 feet long. The fire is in 450 feet of it,''
he said.
   About 150 firefighters remained on site but were unable to get
far into the tunnel because of the intense heat, he said.
   Fire Department estimates variously put the collapsed section at
80 or 140 feet by 20 feet. A California Department of
Transportation spokeswoman said the collapsed section was at least
100 feet and included a segment under the freeway.
   ``We're quite concerned about the integrity of the freeway,''
said Deputy Fire Chief Craig Drummond.
   The fire's cause was unknown and not likely to be known until it
was out.
   There was no estimate of when the fire would be controlled and
predictions of when the freeway would be reopened stretched as long
as Monday morning.
   ``As big a headache as it is, we want to be safe,'' said Margie
Tiritilli, a spokeswoman for Caltrans. ``We want to make sure that
the structure will not collapse. And we're just not certain
underneath with that tunnel.''
   The $1.3 billion, 4-mile subway project was scheduled to open
sometime in 1993. Officials of the Southern California Rapid
Transit District weren't sure how the fire would affect the
timetable.
   Smoke poured out of tunnel vents and the odor permeated downtown.
   ``It started getting to me, it was just disgusting,'' said Jeff
Singer, who got to work at the district attorney's office after
being stuck in traffic almost an hour. ``It was just starting to
make me nauseous.''
   Firefighters poured water into the tunnel during the first hours
and then began considering whether to smother it with foam or pump
in an inert gas such as nitrogen to displace the oxygen that
allowed the fire to burn.
   Two minor injuries to firefighters were reported. Six cleanup
crew workers in one of two underground tubes smelled smoke in the
adjacent tunnel and escaped unharmed.
   The top of the tunnel is 18 feet underground. The tunnel is 19
feet in diameter.
   The Hollywood Freeway, U.S. 101, is a main artery linking
downtown to Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley suburbs. Traffic
from the valley was suprisingly light, some commuters reported, but
freeways such as the Santa Ana, San Bernardino and Glendale were
snarled as they tied into the downtown grid. Surface streets also
backed up.
   ``It was a mess,'' said Elizabeth Munnerlyn, a court secretary
who got to work two hours late.
   ``Some mail will not be delivered today. They could not get into
some areas because of safety reasons,'' said Larry Dozier of the
Postal Service. The downtown post office on Los Angeles Street is
just blocks from the fire.

<TEXT>
   Colombia's president-elect, Cesar Gaviria,
said Friday the United States must curb its appetite for drugs
before his nation can significantly stem illegal cocaine production.
   Gaviria told reporters after meeting with President Bush that
``the demand for drugs is the engine of the trafficking problem. If
the United States and the industrial countries don't get a way to
reduce consumption, we will not solve the problem.
   ``It doesn't matter how much we work against the trafficking of
drugs, how many lives we lose. It doesn't matter how great our
effort, the problem will be there. The United States and
industrialized countries need a way to reduce the consumption of
drugs.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the two presidents
had discussed the administration's pending proposal for $80.5
million in drug-fighting assistance to Colombia.
   ``Colombia has made a great effort against narco-traffickers,''
Gaviria told reporters. ``We have had a lot of violence. ... Three
of our presidential candidates were assassinated, thousands of
Colombians have been killed. And we really are in the front line
all the time.''
   In an interview with The Washington Post, Gaviria said,
``Colombians are waiting for severe sanctions'' against Marion
Barry, the mayor of the nation's capital, who is on trial for drug
and perjury charges.
   Colombians are extremely interested in the Barry trial, Gaviria
said, adding, ``people were quite upset and surprised'' that Barry
had not resigned.
   The Colombian leader told the Post that public support for his
drug-fighting efforts would be diminished if Barry is acquitted.
   Gaviria was elected May 27, when millions of Colombians went to
the polls in defiance of terrorist threats following the bloodiest
campaign in the nation's history.
   In a photo session, Bush praised Gaviria for his ``forthright
commitment'' to fight drugs.
   Gaviria also said he asked Bush to help reverse U.S. moves that
have cut Colombian revenues from coffee and cut-flower exports.
   Colombia has been unhappy over new U.S. tariffs on Colombian
flowers and over the U.S.-led collapse of an international
coffee-pricing agreement.
   ``We have a kind of survival at stake everyday,'' Gaviria said,
adding that Colombia wants the industrialized world to ``understand
that Colombia needs some help. It's not economic aid, not military
help, but basically what we expect is trade.''
   Fitzwater said Bush and Gaviria had ``pledged to continue
working toward mutually satisfactory agreements on various trade
issues.'' One White House official said flowers and coffee had come
up in a general discussion on trade.
   The United States had dropped out of the coffee cartel,
complaining that some coffee-growing nations were secretly selling
coffee surpluses in Eastern Europe at lower prices than those
charged in the United States.
   Without U.S. support, the cartel collapsed. The subsequent drop
in coffee prices cost Colombia more than $500 million in 1989.
Coffee represents one-third of Colombia's legal exports.
   The administration now says that it is trying to get the
agreement renegotiated but that other countries that are a party to
it, including large producers such as Brazil, are not in agreement.
   Colombia wants its cut flowers allowed into the United States
tariff-free.
   Early this year, the Commerce Department made a preliminary
decision to increase tariffs on Colombian cut flowers to an average
as high as 8.5 percent. In May, however, the department eased its
initial decision, placing a tariff averaging 4.16 percent on the
flowers. The Colombians say even that is too high.
   The department, acting on a complaint by U.S. flower growers,
had accused Colombia of dumping freshly cut flowers at below
fair-market prices.
   The U.S. trade representative's office is engaged in talks with
the Colombians on Bush's recent proposal to have free-trade
agreements with all Latin countries.

   Two masked gunmen held up a luxury jewelry shop on
the Avenue Montaigne's fashion row, making off with an estimated
$2.2 million in jewels and watches, the Queen Gallery store said.
   An official at the shop, located off the Champs Elysees, said
two men armed with pistols entered late Thursday morning when there
were no clients, disconnected the security system and went to the
main basement showroom.
   Shouting, they ordered the director to open the display cases
and then forced the five or six employees to lie on their stomachs,
said the store official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   They fled 10 minutes later after seizing the jewelry, employees
said.

<HEAD>Consumers Focusing on Price at Supermarkets, Survey Shows</HEAD>

   Consumers are paying more attention to prices
and taking advantage of coupons and supermarket specials regularly,
reflecting an overall concern about the economy, according to an
industry survey.
   At the same time, supermarket prices this year have increased
faster than expected, but should moderate during the rest of 1990,
a government economist said at a forum Thursday sponsored by the
Food Marketing Institute.
   Price is increasingly becoming a factor in consumer decisions
about where to shop, according to a survey by the institute, a
non-profit grocery store trade group.
   The survey, taken every January for 20 years, questioned the
primary grocery shopper in 1,005 households about attitudes and
practices.
   This year, it found that 96 percent of shoppers rated low prices
as very or somewhat important, up from 92 percent in 1989, 94
percent 1988 and 93 percent in 1987.
   And nearly 40 percent of the people surveyed said they used
coupons or watched for specials in newspaper ads, said Timothy M.
Hammonds, the institute's senior vice president of research and
education. He said that figure was 2 percent to 4 percent more than
a year ago and reversed a general trend since 1982.
   ``People were beginning to get a little less confident about the
economy. There is a general unease,'' he said. The only factors
ahead of prices were quality produce, wide selection and quality
meat.
   Prices at the nation's 147,000 supermarkets rose more in 1989
than in any other year since 1981, Denis Dunham, an agricultural
economist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said at the
conference.
   He said prices averaged 6.5 percent more than in 1988, partly
because of lingering effects of the drought of 1988.
   ``Largely reflecting the price increases that have already
occurred this year, food prices in the second half of 1990 will
average about 4 perent higher than a year earlier,'' he said.
   The causes, he said, included a December freeze in Florida and
Texas and low production of some dairy products. These were offset
in the spring, Dunham said.
   ``Given the developments that seem most likely in commodity
prices and marketing costs, there is not likely to be much increase
in average prices of food at grocery stores in the third and fourth
quarter of 1990,'' he said.
   Also at the seminar:
   _Finding ways to reduce and recycle solid waste will become
increasingly important for an industry in which profit margins
already are less than a penny on the dollar and in a society in
landfill space is shrinking rapidly, said Thirman L. Milner,
director of government affairs for First National Supermarkets Inc.
of Windsor Locks, Conn.
   _Microwaveable foods have grown from ``a category that wasn't
much in existence five years ago'' to a $2.5 billion business, said
Nicholas J. D'Agostino Jr., chief executive of D'Agostino
Supermarkets Inc., a New York area chain.
   _Seventy-two percent of shoppers surveyed said they look at food
labels, but only 36 percent said they looked beyond expiration
dates to ingredient lists or nutrition information.
   _Only 8 percent of shoppers said manufacturers' health claims
are ``very believable,'' but 52 percent said they were ``somewhat
believable.''
   _Supermarket takeout food is increasingly important. ``Not
cooking is becoming a substitute for eating out'' for baby boom
generation families now raising children and strapped for time,
Hammonds said.
   _Convenience foods no longer carry a ``tinge of guilt.''
``Convenience foods let you spend more quality time with your
family,'' Hammonds said. This attachment to convenience foods,
however, is offset somewhat by a willingness to prepare fresh
produce.

<HEAD>Aging Does Not Affect Ability to Remember to Do Tasks, Study Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elderly people remember as well as young people
to do tasks like stopping to buy milk on the way home, says a new
study that surprised memory experts.
   The result appeared in two laboratory tests of prospective
memory, which involves remembering to carry out a task at the right
time.
   Prospective memory is important for older adults who must
remember to take medications and show up for medical appointments,
but research has not clearly shown whether it declines with age,
co-authors of the new study wrote.
   The new results were unexpected because some other kinds of
memory worsen with age, and ``some of the prominent theories in the
area suggest that this kind of memory ought to be especially
difficult for the elderly,'' said study co-author Gilles Einstein.
   Einstein, a psychology professor at Furman University in
Greenville, S.C., and Mark McDaniel of Purdue University report the
federally funded research in the July issue of the Journal of
Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition.
   A prominent memory expert who proposed that aging leads to
declines in prospective memory said the new results surprised him.
   The study was well done, but ``I'm not convinced that it's the
whole and final truth,'' said psychology professor Fergus Craik of
the University of Toronto. Maybe age differences appear under some
conditions but not others, he suggested.
   Einstein agreed, noting that a recent unpublished experiment
found an age difference in a more difficult memory test. But the
published work still suggests no age-related decline in relatively
simple cases of remembering to do a task at the right time, he said.
   One of the new experiments involved 24 people ages 65 or older,
and 24 college students ages 17 to 24. Participants sat in front of
a computer in what they thought was an experiment in improving
short-term memory.
   They were told that they would see a list of words on the
computer screen, and that immediately afterward they would be asked
to recall the words they saw. This would be done 42 times with
different lists, they were told.
   In addition, if they saw the word ``rake'' they were supposed to
press a particular key on the computer keyboard. Half the
participants in each age group were allowed to choose a memory aid,
such as writing the cue word on a piece of paper.
   Participants were kept busy on unrelated tests for 15 minutes to
encourage them to forget about the word ``rake.'' Finally, the
word-list exercise began without any reminder about reacting to
that word, which appeared three times in the course of the exercise.
   Results showed that for participants with no memory aid, the
young and the old groups remembered to push the key equally often,
47 percent of the time ``rake'' appeared.
   Performance was better for those using a memory aid, but age
still had no effect. Nor did any age effect appear in a second
experiment with 48 different participants.

   One of Europe's major north-south links
has been closed down after authorities found a bridge section of it
had sunk about two feet, causing major traffic jams for thousands
of summer vacationers.
   The closure Thursday of the Kneissl Bridge cut off a highway
connecting West Germany to Austria _ a major route for vacationers.
It also shut down the train line between Munich, West Germany, and
the Austrian city of Innsbruck.
   Police tried to reroute traffic during the peak holiday season,
but it only led to tieups on alternate routes, many of which lead
through small towns in Austria.
   Experts said one of the bridge supports appeared to have been
partially dislodged by the force of the Inn River flowing
underneath it. They said repairs could take one year.

   An Iranian government employee has been
sentenced to 20 years in prison for black market sales of foreign
currency that netted him more than $100 million, Iran's official
news agency reported.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Ali
Sharifiyun was an ``economic terrorist,'' a term for people making
excessive profits.
   The Tehran government has been fighting an uphill battle against
corruption, which is said to have spread throughout the bloated
bureaucracy.
   IRNA said Sharifiyun, whose job was not identified, earned $114
million by diverting foreign exchange to the black market, where
the dollar sells for up to 20 times its official rate of 70 rials.
   He was ordered to surrender the profits, pay a fine and serve 20
years in prison.
   It could have been worse for Sharifiyun. The Parliament, or
Majlis, ruled in May that ``economic terrorists'' should be
executed for major offenses.

   A woman who said doctors left an
18-by-24-inch towel in her abdomen after an operation filed a $1
million lawsuit against a hospital and a surgeon.
   Dorothea J. Cline, and her husband, Randall, both of Pineville,
said in the lawsuit that Dr. Daniel Stewart left the towel inside
an incision made in Mrs. Cline's lower abdomen during exploratory
surgery on July 27, 1988.
   After her discharge from the hospital, Mrs. Cline continued to
experience pain and other medical problems, said the lawsuit filed
Thursday in Monongalia County Circuit Court against West Virginia
University Hospitals Inc. and Stewart.
   She was readmitted to the hospital, where physicians removed a
green surgical towel on Oct. 17, 1988, the lawsuit said.
   Mrs. Cline is seeking $1 million in compensatory damages,
attorney's fees and court costs. Her husband, also a plaintiff,
sued the defendants for $250,000 in compensatory damages and court
costs.
   Several telephone calls to Stewart, now a physician in Columbia,
Mo., went unanswered Thursday.
   Brian Gallagher, associate general counsel for West Virginia
University Hospitals, Inc., said he had not seen the lawsuit and
declined to comment. Bernard Westfall, president of West Virginia
University Hospitals, Inc., also would not comment.

<TEXT>
   In the midst of furious negotiations at the
seven-nation Houston summit, the Europeans balked at U.S. pressure
to yield on farm subsidies. The White House negotiators finessed
the moment and it passed.
   ``The Europeans were being critical, but in fact they were
complimenting President Bush. They kept saying that this is the
least pushy of the White House administrations in many years,''
said a Canadian official who recounted the moment.
   ``Bush is exactly suited to bridging the gap by persuasion,''
the official said.
   At the Houston meeting this ability proved crucial.
   The U.S. president met this week with the leaders of the other
major industrialized democracies in radically changed circumstances.
   The Cold War, which for decades kept the militarily mighty
United States as the undisputed leader of the West, is over.
   And gone, too, is America's once unquestioned economic dominance.
   For Bush it amounted to a unique challenge: would the others
still accord the United States a pre-eminent role, and would they
still feel they need Washington in quite the same way?
   At the end of three-day meeting with the leaders of Canada,
Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Italy, the answer appeared
to be an unqualified yes, despite the subtly changing dynamics.
   The Europeans, apart from Britain's unswervingly pro-American
Margaret Thatcher, are often prickly about U.S. muscle. But they
were full of praise this time.
   West Germany, whose dominance in Europe is soon to be enhanced
in a united Germany, bowed gracefully to U.S. rejection of its
urgings for direct financial assistance now to the Soviet Union.
   ``George Bush continues to be the most reliable friend the
Germans have,'' said Hans Klein, spokesman for West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   ``But someone like Helmut Kohl understands that his actions
sometimes have to be guided by different considerations from ours.''
   And Japan, which has already replaced the United States as the
world's largest creditor country, said Bush showed at Houston that
America can lead by persuasion.
   ``He is showing himself to be very, very competent and has an
ability to be very considerate to the feelings of other nations,''
said Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe.
   ``The potential of the United States is still greater than it
has shown in actual achievements ... it still attracts people from
our country who are looking for the best atmosphere in which
innovative activities can be pursued.''
   The summit had its sticky moments. There was tough talking to
find a compromise between American demands for a real commitment to
cut agricultural subsidies and European resistance.
   West Germany wanted to go a lot farther than the United States
on environmental measures. And while Britain, Japan and Canada
lined up with the United States on the Soviet aid issue, West
Germany, France and Italy had strong opposing views.
   ``There were real breakthroughs that I wouldn't have thought
possible a week ago,'' said the Canadian official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``And much of this was due to George Bush. He gives the
impression of being an erudite Ivy League professor. He is very
well-briefed, seldom speaks from notes, and uses logic and
argument, not strongarm.''
   The summit, the second time Bush had met the European leaders in
two weeks including a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in
London, also appeared to have been genuinely friendly despite the
differences.
   ``George Bush's chairmanship was very relaxed,'' said British
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. ``It's been very clear-headed and
conciliatory.''
   In the British view, U.S. leadership is now more, not less,
vital because of what Mrs. Thatcher sees as the danger of the
transatlantic relationship weakening in the post-Cold War era.
   However, British officials acknowledge the personal chemistry
between Bush and Mrs. Thatcher isn't the same as the exceptionally
close relationship the British leader had with Ronald Reagan.
   ``But the intellectual chemistry with Bush is better,'' said a
Thatcher aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He's not the
same intense arguer and debater that she is; he's a much more
relaxed chap who talks it through. But at least they can discuss,
there was real debate here.''

   Chester Atkins' congressional district in
Massachusetts is a long way from Cambodia, but the convoluted
politics of the Southeast Asian nation are complicating his
re-election race.
   The three-term Democrat, a congressional expert on Cambodian
affairs, is being criticized on two fronts.
   First, his Republican opponent, state Rep. Jack MacGovern,
charges that Atkins opened the floodgates for a surge of Cambodian
immigrants to the district, putting a drain on local resources.
   The district's largest city, Lowell, has roughly 20,000
Cambodian immigrants, second in the United States only to Long
Beach, Calif.
   At the same time, Atkins is drawing fire from Cambodian refugees
because he has tried to block any aid from going to Cambodia. A
group of about 100 Cambodians recently staged a protest outside
Atkins' Lowell office.
   Atkins, 42, is known for helping refugees escape to the United
States. He opposes sending financial assistance to Cambodia because
he fears it may end up helping the Khmer Rouge, one of the
guerrilla groups fighting for control of Phnom Penh.
   The Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge were responsible for the
genocidal killing of nearly 1 million Cambodians when they ruled
the country in the 1970s.
   Last month, Atkins led an unsuccessful floor fight to block $7
million in ``non-lethal'' aid to Cambodian revolutionary forces.
   ``Atkins is getting hit by both sides up in this city,'' said
MacGovern, 38. ``You cannot be surprised when you have certain
hostilities arise when all that (non-Cambodians) see is the burden
side of it and the fact that they have to hire teachers who speak
Cambodian.''
   Atkins bitterly accuses MacGovern of waving the flag of racism
and fostering resentment of the Cambodian immigrants.
   MacGovern has ``falen in with ... people who have really played
to the very darkest instincts and fears that people have,'' the
congressman said.
   He also accuses MacGovern's allies of helping arrange the
protest by Cambodian refugees.
   Atkins denies that he has encouraged Cambodians to come to
Lowell, saying that they were attracted by jobs in the
working-class city. Once the city's Cambodian community was
established, it served as a magnet to other immigrants, he said.
   He defends his interest in foreign policy, particularly his
efforts to encourage Cambodians to find a peaceful solution to
their political problems. If Cambodia is stable, many refugees from
Lowell could return to their homeland, he says.
   ``Part of what I'm trying to do with my efforts at peace is to
create the sort of environment so that they can go back,'' he said.
   MacGovern says he's pro-Lowell, not anti-Cambodian.
   ``A lot of people feel that the city has been left alone and has
not received enough help,'' MacGovern said. ``My position is there
ought to be federal impact aid for a city like Lowell.''
   Atkins acknowledges ``widespread anger and resentment'' to the
Cambodian population in Lowell, but he insists he has made sure the
city received $1.7 million in extra federal help in the last 18
months.
   ``We're now getting frequent and significant federal grants,
particularly for the schools, so that the Southeast Asian kids
don't take resources away from the other kids,'' he said.
   Despite sensitivity over the Cambodian issues, MacGovern is a
long shot to unseat Atkins.
   With fewer than 2,000 of Lowell's Cambodians registered to vote,
they will have little say in deciding the election.
   ``They're a political factor, certainly,'' Atkins said.
``They're not a force.''

<HEAD>Republicans Promise to Get Back on Offense, Even on Taxes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republicans, stung by Democratic attacks over the
savings and loan crisis, are promising to get their party back on
the offense _ even when it comes to discussing President Bush's
reversal on taxes.
   ``Don't get defensive,'' GOP pollster Bob Teeter told the
Republican National Committee on Thursday. ``It is the single
greatest mistake I think we could make.''
   Teeter, voicing publicly what many GOP leaders are mumbling
about privately, said Bush's decision to ditch his ``no new taxes''
pledge could hurt Republicans in the short term.
   But he told the party leaders that Bush had to make the
concession to win a promise of spending cuts from the Democrats
controlling Congress _ and that the GOP will quickly rebound if
Bush negotiates a significant deficit reduction plan.
   ``A good economy is good politics,'' Teeter said. ``There is no
worse politics than a recession.''
   Democrats have been tweaking the Republicans by blaming Bush and
the GOP for the burgeoning savings and loan crisis, tying in Bush's
switch on taxes by saying he wants to use the increased revenues to
bail out failed thrifts.
   The Democrats, borrowing a page from GOP political handbooks,
got out front in the S&amp;L political debate, and Republicans spent
much of Thursday trying to mount a counteroffensive.
   The GOP strategists sought to frame the next round of the tax
debate, saying Bush's concession on taxes was a tough but bold move
that Democrats should acknowledge by supporting cuts in programs
like Social Security and other entitlements long favored by
Democrats.
   ``Now is the time to turn the focus of the American people to
the Democrats,'' Teeter said.
   He also tried to allay the fears of Republicans who believe that
including any income tax increase in a deficit reduction plan would
be devastating to the GOP.
   Privately, the senior Republican officials are telling the RNC
members the White House will oppose any attempt to raise income
taxes. Teeter was less specific in his public comments, but he said
Bush ``will not support, he will not sign, he will not agree to any
deal that is not a good deal for our country and for our economy.''

   Vice President Dan Quayle today made the same assurance in
prepared remarks for a luncheon speech to the RNC.
   ``His (Bush's) position is simple,'' Quayle said. ``A good deal
or no deal at all.''

   It was clear that GOP strategists came to this two-day meeting
aiming to get the party back on the attack. This fall's elections
are vital to GOP hopes of eroding the Democratic majority in
Congress and boosting their influence in post-census redistricting.
   ``We have a tremendous opportunity as a party if we don't go on
the defensive,'' said Ed Rollins, chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee.
   Most of his lengthy speech was aimed at blunting the Democratic
attacks on over the S&amp;L crisis, which now often include references
to the troubles of Bush's son, Neil, who is under investigation for
his role as a director of a failed Colorado thrift.
   Rollins said Democrats in Congress resisted early Reagan and
Bush administration efforts to clean up the troubled industry
because of the financial support they were getting from S&amp;L
interests.
   ``For a few million dollars in campaign contributions, the
Democrats sold out the taxpayers,'' Rollins said.
   Rollins did not say so, but many of the S&amp;L executives he
identified as big Democratic donors also gave heavily to Republican
causes, including one who gave $100,000 to the GOP's 1988
presidential campaign.
   Rollins' speech was barely over when the Democrats countered in
what has became an escalating rhetorical war over blame for the
$300 billion-plus debacle _ in Democratic Chairman Ron Brown's
words ``the greatest ripoff in American history.''
   Said Brown: ``We're not surprised that `casino economy'
Republicans who gambled us into this whole mess are whining and
scapegoating every step of the way.''
   Meanwhile, Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater, who has
been battling a life-threatening brain tumor for the past four
months, was quoted in today's Washington Post as saying he has been
urging party leaders and the White House to ``go on the offensive
and be more aggressive'' in challenging Democrats on issues such as
the S&amp;L scandal.
   Atwater remained in Washington during the party meeting.

   Discovery of the gene linked to the Elephant
Man's disease may be too late to help Porter Colley, but the
Massachusetts woman whose tumor-covered face is a mark of the
disease says that, at last, there is hope.
   Ms. Colley, speaking Thursday at a news conference with
researchers who have isolated the disease gene, said the most
wrenching part of being one of 100,000 Americans with
neurofibromatosis was the bleak sense that nothing could be done.
   The discovery of the neurofibromatosis, or NF, gene changes all
that and raises, for the first time, the possibility that the
untreatable disorder may eventually be understood and controlled.
   ``The most painful feeling has been that there was no hope for
progress in NF research,'' she said, television lights glinting off
the globular masses scarring her face. ``It was almost as if people
with NF had been singled out for a particularly cruel life.''
   With the isolation of the NF gene, she said, ``now there is real
hope.''
   ``It may not change the tumors I have,'' said Ms. Colley, her
voice unsteady. ``But to know along with others with NF that we
have reason to hope is to know that we are full participants in the
human experience.''
   Research teams from the University of Michigan and the
University of Utah discovered the NF gene virtually at the same
time and both are publishing their results today in journals.
   Dr. Francis Collins, head of the Michigan research team, said it
may be years before the gene discovery leads to new therapy for the
disease, which affects one in every 4,000 newborns. But he said
tests may be developed fairly soon to genetically identify
youngsters with the disease, or couples who may give birth to NF
children.
   ``We have pried open the black box of neurofibromatosis and are
peering inside,'' Collins said.
   The co-discoverer of the gene was a Utah team led by Raymond
White.
   Collins published his study in Science, the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, and White's
report was in the magazine Cell.
   For Collins it was the second major gene discovery in 11 months.
He was a co-discoverer of the cystic fibrosis gene last August.
   For two-thirds of NF patients, the symptoms are mild skin
discoloration. For the rest, the disease causes tumors that can pop
up anywhere in the body, but always on nerve tissue. The tumor
growth can raise large globular masses on the face, trunk or limbs,
and can distort growing bones, causing crippling or misalignment of
the skull.
   Symptoms often appear in early childhood, although many cases
don't become known until the patient is in puberty.
   Ms. Colley said she has undergone numerous operations for
removal of tumors, including one in her neck the size of a turkey
egg that almost killed her.
   NF was once inaccurately known as the Elephant Man's disease
because it was believed to be the cause of the deformities on John
Merrick, a 19th century Englishman whose life was portrayed in a
play and a movie. Experts have since determined, however, that
Merrick had another disorder, Proteus syndrome.
   But Ms. Colley said many NF patients suffer the same social
isolation that affected the Elephant Man.
   ``I've been called the Elephant Man and I've been called Mrs.
Merrick,'' she said. The movie on the Elephant Man ``did help in
public understanding and I am grateful to John Merrick for that.''
   Collins said finding the NF gene can be compared to locating a
house somewhere in the United States after starting out without an
address or even a hint of the right state.
   Earlier researchers, he said, mapped the NF gene to chromosome
17, which was like finding the right state. But that still left
thousands of possible locations.
   ``We'd still be slogging around if it hadn't been for the
identification of two crucial patients who have NF,'' said Collins.
They were found to have breaks in chromosome 17 at the same place
and in an area where the other work had narrowed the search.
   ``Those translocations (chromosome breaks) actually interrupted
the gene itself and therefore provided crucial landmarks,'' he
said. The gene interruption meant that there was a mutation that
could be related to NF.
   Collins said all normal human cells have the NF gene and the
disease occurs only when the gene is mutated in some way. This
mutation may be passed from parent to child, with a 50-50 chance of
inheritance. But just as frequently, the mutation occurs
spontaneously.

<TEXT>
   Except when asked about his son Neil's
business problems or his own relaxed view of global warming,
President Bush is rarely as agitated as when he is challenged on
his policy toward China.
   Having served a one-year stint as head of the U.S. liaison
office _ before there were formal diplomatic relations and
full-fledged ambassadors _ Bush fancies himself an expert on the
complex land that has perplexed Westerners for centuries.
   He doesn't appreciate being questioned about his moves on China,
and especially resents the widely held notion that he is soft on
Beijing.
   ``They are wrong,'' was Bush's answer this week to those who
detected a double standard in supporting loans to China but
opposing more than technical assistance to the Soviet Union.
   ``The pressure is still on,'' he said during the Houston
economic summit.
   Yet when it comes to China, Bush is feeling his way, lurching
from respectful deference to the leaders of the world's most
populous country to criticism of their record on human rights.
   Universal disgust with the brutal treatment of pro-democracy
forces in Beijing in June 1989 drove Bush into sanctions that he
was reluctant to impose.
   He then joined leaders of the seven industrial democracies who
in July 1989 adopted a declaration freezing most loans to China and
offering extended visas to Chinese students.
   But that same month, without any sign of change in China, Bush
undercut his own sanctions by secretly dispatching Brent Scowcroft,
his national security adviser, and Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputy
secretary of state, to Beijing for high-level talks.
   That trip and another in December by the two officials assured
Chinese leaders that whatever their record on human rights, the
United States under Bush would not seek to isolate them. After the
uprising, thousands of political prisoners were jailed in China,
most without specific charges.
   At the Houston summit, Bush joined in giving Japan a free hand
to resume a $5.6 billion loan program to China. Also, the seven
democracies authorized the World Bank to consider other loans.
   At a news conference, Bush said those actions did not mean the
sanctions imposed in Paris had been lifted. The loans the World
Bank will consider deal with the environment and with promoting
reform in China, he said.
   ``We have offered the hope that if they take further steps in
the human rights field, more can be done,'' the president said.
   He said he wants China to move forward ``and I want to see
restored good relations with China, but we are not there yet.''
   Hundreds of political prisoners have been released. But hundreds
of others remain in jail. It is hard to tell how many, said Alan
Romberg, senior fellow for Asia at the private Council on Foreign
Relations in New York, because the Chinese do not keep lists of
their prisoners.
   Last month, the best-known dissident, Fang Lizhi, and his wife,
Li Shuxian, were allowed to leave China after spending more than a
year sheltered in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
   Romberg said Thursday that there are signs the Chinese ``will
release pretty near everyone else in the near future.''
   Romberg, a former State Department official, credited Bush with
a policy that ``overall has been correct'' but also is far from
perfect in execution.
   He faulted Bush for the way he handled visas for Chinese
students. The president first vetoed legislation to permit the
students to remain in the United States, then used his executive
powers to allow them to remain.
   But Romberg praised Bush and the other leaders for maintaining a
firm line against most bank loans to China. He said the decision in
Houston to let the World Bank consider loans that promote economic
reform was ``a modest step forward and not what the Chinese want.''
   The Chinese wanted last year's summit ban on loans lifted.
   Bush's next test on China will come in Congress.
   In May, responding to urgent appeals from Beijing, he extended
for a year what is called most-favored-nation status. That means
imports from China are not priced out of the market with
artificially high U.S. tariffs.
   Congress has until Aug. 31 to pass a resolution disapproving the
decision. At stake is $18 billion a year in U.S.-China trade.
   Meanwhile, the House Appropriations and Banking committees have
passed legislation to deduct the U.S. share of any World Bank loans
to China that are not made on the basis of basic human needs.
   The outcome will depend on whether Congress can figure out where
Bush stands on China and if that stand is considered tough enough.

<HEAD>Wheat Crop Third Highest Ever, Despite Bad Weather in Some Areas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's wheat crop this year is a
whopper, despite floods in some areas and drought in others, the
Agriculture Department says.
   All told, the crop may be about 2.7 billion bushels, a six-year
high and 33 percent more than last year's harvest, the department
said Thursday.
   ``This would be the largest crop since 1982 and the third
largest on record,'' the department said in a report.
   It will be a near-record production at that. Records show the
biggest U.S. wheat crops were back-to-back in 1981 with 2.79
billion bushels and 1982 with 2.77 billion.
   And if winter wheat yields had improved in June instead of
deteriorating, it would have been even closer.
   New production estimates for the first time this season included
durum and other spring-planted wheat, in addition to winter wheat
planted last fall.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said the average
yield, based on indications as of July 1, was estimated at 38.6
bushels per acre, compared with 32.8 bushels last year.
   Farmers are expected to harvest about 70 million acres of wheat
this year, also the most since 1982. The 1989 crop was from 62.1
million harvested acres.
   The department's first official estimate of 1990 corn, soybeans
and some other major spring-planted crops will be issued Aug. 9,
along with an updated estimate of wheat production.
   Winter wheat production was estimated at 2.04 billion bushels,
down 3 percent from the June forecast but up 40 percent from the
1989 harvest. Winter wheat makes up about three-fourths of the U.S.
total.
   Yields in many of the winter wheat states are down from the June
forecast, especially in Illinois and Missouri, the report said. The
huge Kansas crop, at 460.2 million bushels, was unchanged from last
month.
   Durum wheat production was estimated at 114 million bushels, up
24 percent from last year, and other spring wheat was indicated at
549 million bushels, up 12 percent from 1989.
   North Dakota, the biggest durum producer, was estimated at 97.6
million bushels, compared with 66 million bushels last year. The
state's production of ``other'' spring wheat, also the largest, was
estimated at 254.4 million bushels, up from 174 million in 1989.
   Government crop watchers said earlier this week that the
nation's wheat harvest was 71 percent completed by July 8, slightly
ahead of the five-year average for this time.
   The July report also estimated barley production at 414 million
bushels, up 3 percent from last year. Yields were indicated at 53.4
bushels per acre, up 4.9 bushels from 1989.
   Oat production was estimated at 375 million bushels, virtually
the same as last year, with average yields at 60.2 bushels per
acre, compared with last season's 54.4 bushels.
   Flue-cured tobacco production was forecast at 856 million
pounds, up 6 percent from last year, reflecting a larger acreage.
   In a related supply-and-demand report, ``highly tentative''
projections of 1990 production of corn showed the fall harvest
might total 7.85 billion bushels.
   That would be down from the 8.1 billion bushels projected in
June, but still larger than the 1989 harvest of 7.53 billion
bushels.
   Soybean production also was projected down _ 1.86 billion
bushels against 1.93 billion projected in June. Last year's output
was about 1.93 billion bushels, about what had been projected in
June for 1990.
   The analysis showed wheat prices at the farm in 1990-91 may
average in the range of $2.80 to $3.20 per bushel, down 10 cents
from the June forecast. Last season, wheat prices averaged $3.72
per bushel.
   Corn prices, reflecting tighter supplies, were projected to
average $2.50 to $2.90 per bushel in the 1990-91 marketing year, up
15 cents from June. They are expected to be in the range of $2.35
to $2.40 in 1989-90.
   Soybean prices were projected at $5.50 to $6.75 per bushel, a
50-cent increase from the range last month. The 1989-90 price was
estimated at $5.70 per bushel.
   Cotton production was projected at 15 million bales, down 1
million bales from the June outlook, primarily because of
``extremely hot, dry conditions which have reduced prospective
harvested acreage and trimmed potential yields in Texas,'' the
report said.
   No price information was projected for 1990-91 cotton.

   The Agriculture Department has scheduled an
extended public hearing on the government's milk pricing apparatus
this fall in six cities.
   John E. Frydenlund, deputy assistant secretary for marketing and
inspection services, said Thursday the hearing will focus on issues
that are ``national in scope.''
   The hearing will be held between Sept. 5 and Oct. 15 in Eau
Claire, Wis.; Minneapolis, Minn.; St. Cloud, Minn.; Syracuse, N.Y.;
Tallahassee, Fla.; and Irving, Texas.
   Department officials on March 29 invited public comments and
suggestions on what the hearing agenda should include. Frydenlund
said more than 130 proposals were received by the May 31 deadline.
   The hearing will involve the milk pricing provisions used in all
federal marketing orders, the system used to set minimum prices for
milk that dealers must pay farmers.
   Although the marketing orders do not set retail milk prices, the
minimums specified at the farm level are felt through the marketing
chain.
   On the hearing agenda, he said, are proposals for establishing
prices for Class I (drinking) milk and Class II milk used to make
``soft'' products such as cottage cheese, yogurt and ice cream.
   The proposals call for establishing a uniform system of
classifying milk by its uses, and for changing regulations on
reconstituted milk _ milk that has had its water removed in one of
several ways, and to which water is added later.

<HEAD>Earthquake Rattles French Island of Martinique, Windward Islands</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   BASSE-TERRE, Guadeloupe (AP) _ A moderate earthquake in the
Caribbean shook Martinique and the Windward Islands Thursday night,
but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries, radio
stations and officials said.
   The quake of 5.5 on the Richter scale struck at 7:08 p.m. EDT in
the Windward Islands, 50 miles east of Fort-de-Frnce, Martinique,
according to the U.S. Geological Service in Golden, Colo.
   Radio Paris, in a broadcast relayed on Radio Caraibe in
Guadeloupe, reported that three tremors struck Martinique shortly
after 7 p.m. The report said there were no injuries or damage, but
gave no further details.
   There were unconfirmed reports of some electrical and telephone
outages on Martinique, a French territory.
   There were no immediate reports on how the quake affected the
three Windward Islands, part of the Netherlands Antilles.
   Myriam Inimod, a biology student reached in the southern
Martinique city of Trinite, said in a telphone interview that she
was in a movie theater when she felt two tremors. She said the
first was mild but the second was ``terrible.''
   She said there was no panic, however, and that she saw no
evidence of damage as she drove through town.
   Martinique is a French overseas department of 336,000 people,
and a popular tourist destination. It is situated between the
Caribbean islands of Dominique and St. Lucia.
   Martinique is the site of one of the most devastating volcanic
eruptions in history, on May 8, 1902. Mt. Pelle erupted, and in
less than 3 minutes annihilated the city of St. Pierre, killing an
estimated 30,000 people.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause
considerable damage, while one measuring 6 can cause severe damage.

routine'' the American Civil Liberties Union calls a violation of
the First Amendment rights of a group lobbying for an end to
military aid to El Salvador.
   The department wrote the National Agenda for Peace in El
Salvador in June asking it to describe the nature of its
``activities for or in the interests of'' the Salvadoran leftist
rebel group, Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front or FMLN, and
whether its activities were financed or directed by a foreign
organization.
   The department's letter said a newspaper advertisement in May
sponsored by National Agenda ``indicates that you are engaged in
publicity activities on behalf of'' the FMLN.
   The ad called on Congress to end military aid to El Salvador as
a way to force a political solution to the decade-old civil war and
to push for action against whoever was responsible for the murder
late last year of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her
daughter.
   The head of the three-member Washington staff of National
Agenda, Geoffrey Thale, told a news conference Thursday, ``Our view
clearly is that we're not foreign agents and not subject to the
act.'' Asked if National Agenda receives money from anyone in El
Salvador, Thale replied, ``No, and if you could see our office
you'd know we don't get enough money from anybody.''
   The department has no statutory authority to ask such questions,
Morton Halperin, director of the Washington office of the ACLU,
said. Even if it did, he said, ``We believe it would be a violation
of the First Amendment rights of Americans to petition the
government for a redress of grievances,''
   At the Justice Department, spokesman Doug Tillett said, ``It
sounds to me like an over-reaction on their part.''
   ``The request itself is fairly routine,'' he added.
   The ACLU released a letter from two House subcommittee chairmen
to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh asking for information about
the inquiry.
   ``There is nothing in the ad to indicate that the group is
engaged in activities on behalf of any foreign principal,'' said
the letter from Reps. Robert W. Kastenmeier, D-Wis., and Don
Edwards, D-Calif.
   They noted the only two references to the FMLN in the ad were
coupled with references to the El Salvador government in a
discussion of the fitful peace negotiations between the two sides.
``It would seem equally logical to conclude that National Agenda is
engaged in publicity activities on behalf of the government of El
Salvador,'' the congressmen wrote.
   In the House Judiciary Committee, Kastenmeier chairs the
subcommittee on courts, intellectual property and the
administration of justice and Edwards chairs the subcommittee on
civil and constitutional rights.
   National Agenda was formed at the 1988 Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta by a group of delegates seeking to bring
visibility to the issue.

<HEAD>Business Community Condemns Strike Accord; Sandinistas Celebrate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista-led strike forced
concessions that left the government's free-enterprise plan
``bleeding,'' the business community says. But the Sandinistas
celebrated what they called a preservation of the gains of their
revolution.
   The crippling strike was settled Thursday with an accord that
grants hefty wage hikes to government workers _ and puts some key
elements of the new administration's plan to return Nicaragua to a
free-market economy on hold.
   The accord also calls for suspension of a decree to return land
confiscated in the 1979 Sandinista revolution to the original
owners. Former President Daniel Ortega says Sandinista land reform
was a basic ``conquest of the revolution.''
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and her aides have said
the settlement prevented more bloodshed and unrest and made it
possible for Nicaragua to get back down to business.
   During the last six days of the strike, street fighting broke
out between strike supporters and opponents, claiming at least four
lives and turning the capital into a maze of bonfires and
barricades.
   Ortega, unseated by Mrs. Chamorro's U.S.-backed United National
Opposition coalition in Feb. 25 elections, said the strike showed
the Sandinistas still wield considerable power in Nicaragua.
   But the nation's business leaders were busy counting up the
costs.
   ``The government lost. The Sandinistas lost. The people lost,''
said Gilberto Cuadra, president of the nation's leading business
group, the Superior Council of Private Enterprise.
   The business council, known by its Spanish acronym COSEP,
described the walkouts by public employees an attempt to
destabilize the government, a charge Ortega denied.
   ``It wasn't a strike; it was mob action,'' Cuadra said in an
interview Thursday.
   He said COSEP estimates economic damage at between $35 million
and $50 million in lost business, property damage and diminished
crops.
   Central Bank President Francisco Mayorga had earlier said the
strike was costing about $2 million a day.
   About 95,000 workers, mostly from federal offices and state-run
farms, walked off their jobs demanding more participation in
economic policy making and job security, Sandinista union leaders
said.
   The strike hit during the planting season and Cuadra said the
cotton crop, crucial to this agricultural nation, may be 30 percent
less than expected.
   A sharp rise in agricultural exports is a key factor in the new
administration's economic recovery program.
   Mrs. Chamorro, who inherited a bankrupt government and a
crippled economy, has promised to reverse more than a decade of
leftist Sandinista rule with measures such as privatization and
trimming a bloated public payroll.
   The Sandinistas, who held power for more than a decade after the
uprising that ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza, have waged a
campaign of labor unrest since Mrs. Chamorro's April 25
inauguration.
   COSEP condemned the government for giving in to what it called
Sandinista ``blackmail'' after the strike turned violent over the
weekend.
   Ortega and the Nicaraguan Human Rights Commission said at least
four people died and at least a score were injured in armed
confrontations between strikers and government supporters. Union
leaders claimed at least six people were killed in the fighting.
   The transmission tower of the private Radio Corporacion was
bombed, vehicles were burned and thousands of paving stones ripped
up to build barricades.
   The government settled the strike, which it had declared
illegal, with an accord giving 65,000 government workers a 43
percent raise this month and another, unspecified raise in August.
   It also agreed to put on hold plans to return some confiscated
farms to pre-revolutionary owners and opened the door to some
degree of power-sharing with workers.
   Cuadra said the agreement had left the economic recovery plan
``bleeding'' and ``thrown cold water'' on hopes that investors
would put money into post-revolutionary Nicaragua.
   But Ortega said Thursday that the Sandinistas don't welcome any
investors who hope to reclaim land or businesses confiscated after
the 1979 revolution. He portrayed the strike as a Sandinista
victory that had preserved fundamental revolutionary gains.
   COSEP says the strike accord diluted Mrs. Chamorro's authority.
   ``She's lost confidence and power,'' Cuadra said.
   But Mrs. Chamorro says the fact that the Sandinista-dominated
army and obeyed her orders constituted a vote of confidence.

   ``Saturday Night Live'' cast member Jon Lovitz
has decided to find out whether acting in movies is the ticket.
   Lovitz, known for his character the pathological liar who says
``That's the ticket,'' said Thursday he's leaving the show.
   ``I've done the show for five years. That's enough,'' he said.
``I've had a great time on the show and it's time to move on.
   ``I've got several offers to do movies and that's the direction
I'm headed,'' he said.
   Lovitz, 32, has finished ``Mr. Destiny,'' a movie for Disney,
and is working on ``Mom and Dad Save the World'' for Warner Bros.
   On ``Saturday Night Live,'' his recurring comedic bits included
an impression of playwright Harvey Fierstein as an
affection-starved talk show host, and as himself, jovially urging
viewers to ``Get to know me!''

   ``Godfather of Soul'' James Brown says critics
of his release from prison to a community work program in Aiken,
S.C., should consider his accomplishments.
   ``When a man has a second-grade education and achieves any goal
in the world ... talk about the records I've set in music. Talk
about those kinds of things,'' Brown said in an interview televised
Thursday on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``Talk about the fact I've outdone anybody you can name _
Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Strauss ... Irving Berlin _ he wrote 1,001
tunes, I wrote 5,500.''
   Brown, released from prison in April, served 15 months of a
six-year sentence for aggravated assault and avoiding police in a
two-state auto chase in 1988.
   Now, he said, his career ``isn't on an upswing, it's flying. ...
I really needed the rest. I would prescribe to anyone all the rest

   Makeup artist Frances ``Frannie'' Arvold, who
powdered the noses of TV celebrities from Edward R. Murrow and Ed
Sullivan to Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather during 40 years at CBS,
has retired.
   The network announced Arvold's retirement Thursday.
   Richard Nixon's refusal to let Arvold make him up during his
1960 debate with John F. Kennedy _ the first televised presidential
debate _ may have cost him the election, some historians have said.
   Nixon, looking haggard next to the youthful Kennedy, lost the
debate in the eyes of those who watched it on television but won it
among those who listened on radio, polls at the time showed.
   ``Don Hewitt, who directed the debates, told Nixon several years
later that had he only allowed Frannie to apply some pancake to his
5 o'clock shadow, she may have changed the course of history,'' CBS
spokeswoman Donna Dees said.

<HEAD>Radio Talk Show Host Suspended for Banning Black Callers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A radio talk-show host was suspended
indefinitely for banning black callers after a colleague's car was
broken into. He later apologized on the air for his ``emotional,
spur-of-the-moment decision.''
   Tim Lennox, host of a live, weekday show on WERC-AM, refused to
allow black callers Wednesday and was suspended Thursday by the
station's general manager, who let him back on the air briefly to
apologize.
   ``I want to sincerely apologize to anyone who was offended by my
actions,'' Lennox told his listeners. ``Anybody who has listened to
my show for 14 years is aware of my liberal outlook.''
   Lennox, 40, who is white, said he had been upset because a black
man broke into a station employee's car and stole her purse
Wednesday, just before the start of his two-hour show.
   Lennox he ``made an emotional spur-of-the-moment decision to
accept only calls from white listeners.''
   The general manager, Berkley Fraser, also apologized on the air
Thursday.
   Fraser said he didn't know how long Lennox would be suspended.
``It will give us at least the weekend to sit down and calm down
and see what the emotion was that got him off on that tangent,'' he
said.
   Lennox said he was proud to have been part of the first
integrated talk show in Birmingham some years back.
   ``None of that excuses yesterday's show, but it might provide
some perspective for what happened,'' he said.
   Fraser said the station encourages free expression with live
programming and ``unfortunately, mistakes do occur.''
   Callers during the Wednesday show talked about their experiences
as crime victims and how to prevent becoming a victim. But nearly
half were critical of Lennox for banning blacks, the Birmingham
Post-Herald said.
   About 60 percent of Birmingham's 284,000 residents are black and
about 40 percent are white.

<HEAD>Members of Congress Seeking Compensation for Hanford Victims</HEAD>

   New disclosures of harmful radiation releases
at the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington state could help
win federal compensation for those who became ill following the
emissions in the 1940s, some lawmakers say.
   ``The federal government owes something if folks have been
harmed by these early releases of radiation,'' said Rep. Sid
Morrison, a Republican whose district houses the 560-square-mile
Hanford reservation near Richland, Wash.
   An independent panel of scientists released preliminary data
Thursday that showed some residents in the early years of atomic
bomb building in the 1940s could have been exposed to large doses
of radioactive iodine.
   For a few infants, the doses were as high as 2,900 rad over
three years. One rad is the amount of radiation a body organ would
absorb from about a dozen chest X-rays.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said the findings underscore the need
for the Energy Department to make public its secret records of
health risks at all DOE sites nationwide. He said he was
``surprised and disturbed'' by the results of the dose
reconstruction study at Hanford.
   ``The study suggests that the Hanford residents may have been
exposed to more radioactive iodine than from any industrial nuclear
facility in the world,'' he said.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., said the Energy Department should
launch a major campaign to help locate people who may have been
exposed to the radiation.
   ``The number of curries released over all these years are
comparable to the levels released in Chernobyl (in the Soviet
Union) ... The missing link is where are the people who were
exposed?'' Adams said.
   ``If we find these people around the country and if there has
been injury then the government should compensate them for it,''
Adams said.
   Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., said if it can be proven that people
were injured as a result of the emissions it ``would be only fair''
to compensate them.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., said the high doses of radiation
exposure during the 1940s suggests a study into thyroid disease
should begin immediately.
   However, he added, ``Radioactive materials have leaked from
existing storage tanks at Hanford as recently as last month... I
fear the public is left with the impression that the only threat at
Hanford existed 30 years ago.''
   Some members of Congress are pushing to remove the Energy
Department's oversight authority of health and environmental safety
at nuclear weapons plants.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., have
proposed bills to establish independent oversight of DOE's weapons
facilities through the Department of Health and Human Services.
   ``I think that because the federal government has misled the
people of the Pacific Northwest, that unless there are truly
independent decisions being made on health and safety, the citizens
of the Northwest are going to doubt the department's credibility,''
Wyden said.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins said his department is preparing
to enter an inter-agency agreement that would transfer some
radiation research activities from DOE to HHS.

<TEXT>
   Marijuana laws will remain a low
priority in this city of '60s love-ins and leftist politics after
anti-pot activists failed in a try at stiffening enforcement.
   Black leaders and others this week didn't gather enough
signatures for a November ballot measure that would let voters
repeal a 1979 law directing police to make marijuana busts their
lowest priority.
   Opponents of that law argued that it sends youngsters the wrong
message about drugs. Proponents contended marijuana does not
necessarily lead to harder drugs.
   ``I think this shows the depth of indifference to any
anti-marijuana movement,'' said Dale Grierginger, California
coordinator of the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
   ``Originally, the ordinance was sort of a declaration of
principle that marijuana use was no big deal,'' he said.
``Enforcing marijuana laws is certainly not a priority with the
public and certainly not in Berkeley.''
   Jim Smith, president of the Black Property Owners Association,
which led the drive to repeal the law, said he plans another try in
1992.
   ``Drugs have become a very devastating problem here,'' he said.
``We don't feel we can tell our kids, `Say no to some drugs, but
not to others.'''
   Smith and his followers did not make the Tuesday deadline for
submitting the required 2,304 signatures to put the initiative on
the ballot in this community of 106,000 residents. The city clerk's
office said the petition drive fell 222 signatures short.
   The 1979 law makes enforcement of marijuana laws the lowest
priority for police. It also commits the city to work for
legalization and legal, private cultivation of the drug.
   About 70 percent of the city's voters approved the ordinance,
which grew out of the freewheeling Age of Aquarius typified by
Berkeley, a site of anti-war student protests, love-ins, leftist
politics and flower power.
   ``Berkeley was the hallmark of progressive movement in the
nation,'' City Manager Michael Brown said. ``I think what has
happened, though, is some young liberals have become old
conservatives.''
   Charles Henderson, program director at First Step Foundation, a
Berkeley drug treatment center, said the ordinance sends mixed
signals to children.
   ``They hear adults in authority talk about this and it creates
confusion,'' he said.
   Grierginger said marijuana does not necessarily lead to harder
drugs. ``The history of the last decade shows precisely the
opposite. Ten years ago, a lot more people smoked marijuana, but
there was less drug abuse,'' he said.
   Mayor Loni Hancock did not take a stand on the initiative,
saying it was a ``non-issue.''
   ``The ordinance was passed by voters at a period when there was
great citizen concern that police were spending an inordinate
amount of time pursuing marijuana offenses rather than other
crimes,'' said Hancock spokeswoman Peggy Sullivan. ``Our main drug
crisis is crack now, and that's the police focus.''
   Police Capt. Waymon Jenkins said the department did not take a
position on repeal because the law doesn't affect how officers work
most of the time.
   ``When it comes to small amounts for personal use we just don't
bother,'' Jenkins said. ``But it's still considered a drug and if
someone is selling it or has large quantities of it we'll enforce
the law.''

<HEAD>Conferees Agree to Phase Out Single-Hull Tankers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate conferees erased a major
obstacle to passage of oil spill protection legislation with
agreement on a compromise to phase out most single-hull oil tankers
over the next 20 years.
   Congressional leaders hoped to finish action on the bill, which
creates a $1 billion emergency oil spill response fund, before the
August recess. The bill also calls for establishment of regional
strike forces to battle oil spills.
   The double-hull issue has been among the thorniest facing
negotiators trying to resolve differences between bills passed by
the House and Senate. The House had sought a phaseout of
single-hull tankers by 2005, while the Senate called only for a
study of the issue.
   But the compromise agreement reached late Thursday would require
that all new oil tankers be built with double hulls and that most
existing tankers be retrofitted with double hulls or taken out of
service between 1995 and 2010. A small number of single-hull
tankers would be allowed to operate until 2015.
   The legislation was prompted by the devastating oil spill from
the tanker Exxon Valdez that in March 1989 contaminated miles of
Alaska's waters and shoreline. Much of the coastline has yet to be
completely cleared of oil despite a cleanup effort that already has
cost $2 billion, according to Exxon and government estimates.
   Approval of the compromise timetable for requiring double-hull
tankers came in voice votes by both the House and Senate members of
the conference committee with virtually no debate.
   Environmental groups, in a letter to the conferees earlier this
week, called a requirement for double-hull tankers ``the single
most important step Congress can take to prevent oil spills.''
   Double hulls provide added protection if a tanker runs aground
or collides with another ship. A Coast Guard study of 30 tanker
groundings between 1969 and 1973 determined that spills would have
been averted in 96 percent of the cases if the vessels had double
hulls. There have been conflicting studies on what effect a double
hull might have had on the Exxon Valdez spill.
   Environmental groups had called for a faster phaseout with all
double-hull tankers gone by 2005. Because of the longer timetable,
Clifton Curtis of Friends of the Earth characterized the
House-Senate compromise ``a kiss on the cheek _ followed by a slap
in the face.''
   The bill calls for a $1 billion emergency response fund to deal
with oil spill cleanup and establishes liability levels for spills.
The fund will comes from a 50-cent-a-barrel levy on petroleum that
already has begun to be collected.
   In addition, the bill would create regional emergency response
teams to deal with oil spills and make it easier for the government
to take over cleanup efforts. It also establishes liability levels
for spills and toughens licensing requirements for tanker crew
members.
   Congressional sources said with the double-hull issue resolved,
the long-debated legislation is likely to be approved before
Congress begins its summer recess Aug. 3.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said the timetable likely will see
43 percent of the tankers with double hulls by the end of the
decade and 80 percent by the year 2005. With few exceptions, all
tankers will have to be double hulled by the year 2010. Tankers
that off-load oil 60 miles outside U.S. waters and tankers that
already have double bottoms or sides have until 2015 to comply.
   There are more than 1,300 tankers of various sizes that
transport oil in and out of the United States and between U.S.
ports, according to congressional estimates. Tankers under 5,000
tons are not subject to the double-hull requirement.

<TEXT>
   When the Organization of African
Unity was born 27 years ago, many nations on the continent were
ruled by European powers. Today the countries are self-ruled, but
unity, peace and prosperity still elude them.
   African heads of state and government who gathered this week for
the OAU's 26th summit pointed to the democratic movements that have
swept Eastern Europe, and expressed hopes for political reform on
their own continent.
   ``We ... recommit ourselves to the full democratization of our
societies and to the consolidation of democratic institutions in
our countries, taking into account the realities of each of our
countries' views,'' the leaders said in a communique Wednesday at
the end of their three-day gathering in the Ethiopian capital of
Addis Ababa.
   But in the cases of some African leaders, the pledge to
democratize seemed like little more than lip service.
   Most of Africa's 550 million people are governed by dictators or
live in one-party states. Popular upheavals and civil wars are
convulsing the continent, and force is the most common response by
African governments.
   Some African leaders were feeling too beleaguered to attend the
OAU summit.
   Liberian President Samuel Doe, under siege in Monrovia from
rebels seeking to seize control, did not attend the conference.
   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, still recovering from riots
against food price hikes that left 26 people dead last month,
stayed away for the first time since he led his country to
independence in 1964.
   And Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi cut short his visit and
flew home on the first day after a weekend of rioting sparked by
demands for a multi-party democracy in his one-party state.
   The absent leaders might have been mindful that leaving their
own capitals could give their opponents an opening to act.
   Yakubu Gowan of Nigeria was toppled in a 1975 coup while he was
attending an OAU summit, and Milton Obote of Uganda was overthrown
during the 1971 British Commonwealth summit in Singapore.
   The OAU's original charter pledged action to improve the living
standards of all Africans, to defend sovereignity, territorial
integrity and independence and to rid the continent of all traces
of colonialism.
   The colonial powers have departed, but other dreams remained
unfulfilled.
   Living standards have plunged, and wars rage in Liberia, Uganda,
Angola, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan.
   A common market proposed in 1980 has yet to be formed, a move to
militarily confront white-ruled South Africa never materialized,
and leaders are still striving for continental unity.
   Of the 30 heads of state who signed the OAU charter on May 25,
1963, only seven were still in power in 1980. Of the others, seven
were assassinated by their own troops, 17 were ousted in coups, two
died of natural causes and one bowed out of office.
   Some leaders conceded they felt left out of the sweeping changes
elsewhere in the world.
   ``It was we Africans who raised high the banner of unity well
before many regions of the world,'' Ethiopian President Mengistu
Haile Mairam told this week's gathering.
   ``But viewed against the current trend of rapid changes in the
international scene and the movement towards harmony and unity
among countries in various regions of the world, the pace of
progress we are making to achieve continental unity has indeed been
very slow,'' he said.
   Julius Nyerere, former president of Tanzania, lamented that
African leaders had not followed northern industrialized nations in
burying differences in order to improve trade and their economies.
   One bright spot at the summit was the presence of Nelson
Mandela, the black South African nationalist leader who was in
prison when the OAU was created. For many of those present,
Mandela's release in February was symbolic of moves toward reform
in South Africa.
   But South Africa's system of racial segregation has at least
provided a rallying point for the OAU states. If apartheid is
eventually dismantled, some observers said, the OAU might not find
much else to agree on.

<HEAD>House Spending Bill May Not Survive Budget Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill that earmarks $27 billion for roads,
bridges, airports, railroads and commuter rails next year cruised
through the House only to face a potential pothole: budget talks.
   ``We may not be able to keep this one after the budget summit,''
Rep. Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa., said Thursday before the House
passed the spending bill, 385-31.
   The overall bill for the Transportation Department and related
agencies totals $31 billion, with the bulk covering money for
various projects.
   Although intended to relieve crowded, aging highways and
airports, the bill also contains millions for local projects in the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Rep. William Lehman, the Florida Democrat whose appropriations
subcommittee prepared the bill, said the delays caused by a
decaying transportation system cost the nation ``billions of
dollars in lost working hours and in economic production.''
   Because of ongoing negotiations between the Congress and the
White House to reduce the budget deficit, the spending levels could
change. The Senate has not yet taken up the bill.
   Under an amendment approved, 331-88, states would lose 2 percent
of their federal highway dollars unless they enact laws to suspend
or revoke for at least six months the driver's license of any
person convicted of a drug offense.
   The bill as now written gives the Bush administration $107
million less than it had sought for aviation but $1 billion more
than was appropriated for this year.
   The overall spending for transportation and related agencies
would be $2.8 billion higher than this year's level.
   The biggest chunk goes for highways _ nearly $15 billion _
reflecting Lehman's contention that the highway system accounts for
nearly 90 percent of passenger miles traveled. The amount is $2.7
billion more than requested by the administration, which Lehman
criticized for trying to shortchange rails and highways in favor of
air transportation.
   The $8.1 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration
includes a 24 percent increase over the current year's level for
facilities and equipment, including Doppler weather radar, and $10
million for expansion of the Dallas-Fort Worth regional airport.
   The bill also provides $71 million to replace air traffic
control facilities at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports and at
Helena, Mont., Kansas City, Mo.; Los Angeles; Montgomery, Ala.;
Newark, N.J.; San Diego, Calif., and St. Louis.
   The radar funds are for Columbus, Ohio; Chicago's Midway;
Indianapolis; Milwaukee; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Oklahoma City and
Wichita, Kan.
   The rail money, $736.5 million, is $667 million higher than what
the administration requested and $30 million over this year's
level. It includes $482 million in subsidies for Amtrak and $12
million to study the prospects of developing a magnetic levitation
system, which would use magnets to lift and propel trains.
   The $3.2 billion set for mass transit is more than $900 million
above the administration's request and $156 million over this
year's level.
   Among the projects are $440 million in new rail systems,
including $150 million for construction in Los Angeles, $66 million
for St. Louis, $45 million for San Francisco, $30 million for metro
transit in Houston, $20 million for light-rail development in
Dallas, $22 million for a skyway project in Jacksonville, Fla., and
$10 million for engineering and design of a light-rail system in
Honolulu.
   An existing project, the Washington, D.C., subway system, would
get $108 million.

   A man who mistakenly received the
AIDS-tainted blood of a patient with the same last name has died,
apparently of non-AIDS-related causes.
   The patient, whose name and age weren't disclosed, died
Thursday, the Veterans Administration Medical Center said. The man
was elderly and was already seriously ill before receiving the
erroneous injection June 26, the hospital said.
   The man died long before the virus that causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome normally would disable a body's immune system.
That can take years.
   ``It is the opinion of the patient's physicians that his death
was not AIDS-related,'' hospital spokesman Ron Lopez said. An
autopsy was planned.
   Dr. Darwin Palmer, chief of infectious diseases at the hospital,
has said the patient inadvertently received the AIDS-infected blood
when he and an AIDS patient underwent the same blood scan within 24
hours of each other.
   Both men had the same last name and were in the same ward.

<HEAD>Budget Negotiators Prepare to Trade Tax Boost Plans</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: GOP, Democratic negotiators meet separately in morning EDT;
lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Budget negotiators from the White House and
Congress expect to begin trading offers by early next week on about
$25 billion in tax boosts for next year.
   Bargainers from both political parties, asking to remain
anonymous, said Republicans could send Democrats the first package
of levies by Monday. It would be the first serious effort in the
2-month-old talks to tackle the most politically delicate issue
negotiators face: whose taxes will be raised, and by how much.
   ``We expect to have it in hand by early next week,'' a Democrat
said. ``The group will then evaluate it.''
   Republicans said no final decisions have been made on what taxes
the plan will include.
   But one GOP bargainer said it will probably contain boosts in
excise taxes, perhaps on alcohol and tobacco products, as well as a
cut in the capital gains tax rate. It is unlikely to contain a
boost in income tax rates, which many Republicans have adamantly
opposed, the official said.
   In recent days, participants in the talks and lobbyists have
said that broad energy taxes also stand a good chance of emerging
from the negotiations.
   Budget summit sessions today and Thursday were canceled so
bargainers from the two parties could meet separately to formulate
strategies. Negotiators are searching for at least $50 billion in
spending cuts and tax boosts for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1,
in an effort to shrink a budget shortfall that will otherwise hit
at least $160 billion.
   On Thursday, Republicans discussed a list of 70 to 80 possible
tax increases but made no decisions on which should be included in
any package, said Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., one of the negotiators.
   Packwood said the Republicans talked about taxes on sales of
stocks and on tobacco, alcohol, energy and luxury items.
   Also Thursday, House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia
said it was ``arrogant and outrageous'' for Senate Democratic
Leader George Mitchell to demand higher income tax rates for
wealthy Americans in exchange for a GOP-sought cut in the capital
gains levy.
   Gingrich, the No. 2 House Republican leader, said Mitchell's
stance threatens the budget talks.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, said Wednesday that if President Bush refused
to accept a boost in the income tax rates paid by the nation's
richest wage-earners, there would be no deal to cut the capital
gains tax rate.
   Bush has sought a reduction in the capital gains tax since his
presidential campaign. The tax is paid on the profits from the
sales of property such as real estate and stocks.
   Republicans say reducing the tax will encourage property sales
and thus allow the government to collect additional money.
Democrats say the idea would increase tax collections immediately
but be a long-range money-loser.
   On the House floor and at a later news conference, Gingrich said
budget bargainers had agreed that everything would be negotiable.
   ``I think it was a stupid mistake,'' he said of Mitchell's
demand. ``I think it is arrogant and outrageous. I think he should
withdraw it.''
   Gingrich, who is one of the budget negotiators, added, ``If
that's his non-negotiable position, I don't see any reason to walk
into a room with him.''
   Asked if he would boycott the talks, Gingrich said, ``I don't
know. We'll have to wait and see how irrationally obstructive
George Mitchell wants to be.''
   Mitchell declined to respond to Gingrich. A spokesman said:
``The senator will continue to discuss the substance of issues but
will not engage in a name-calling contest with someone like Rep.
Gingrich.''

<HEAD>Mayor's Friend Says Cocaine Possession No Crime</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Court resumes 10 a.m. EDT; will be led</NOTE>

   A prosecution witness at Marion Barry's trial
says he doesn't think cocaine possession is a crime, while another
told the jury the mayor was a victim of entrapment.
   The statements came Thursday from two longtime friends of the
mayor who were testifying reluctantly for the government.
   Both men said they had possessed cocaine and distributed it to
Barry. They aren't being charged because of their assistance to the
government.
   ``I thought use of cocaine was a personal matter,'' said Jeffrey
Mitchell, an advertising executive who worked on Barry's mayoral
campaigns.
   Mitchell testified that he and the mayor snorted cocaine on at
least 10 occasions from 1985 to 1987. In most instances, Mitchell
said he was the one who supplied the cocaine.
   ``You don't feel you committed a crime?'' Mitchell was asked.
   ``Under the circumstances that went down, no,'' Mitchell replied.
   Mitchell said he thought distribution of cocaine was a crime,
but didn't think his own actions necessarily constituted
distribution.
   But Barry's chief lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, pointed out that
Mitchell gave cocaine to his friends, and that is a crime.
   ``I guess technically, yeah,'' Mitchell conceded.
   Mitchell testified that Barry was taking drugs and drinking
heavily before he was rushed to a hospital by ambulance during a
Super Bowl party in Los Angeles in 1987.
   Mitchell said he found Barry collapsed on a living room chair
complaining that he was having trouble breathing.
   The mayor was making sniffing noises, as he had done in the past
after using cocaine, said Mitchell.
   He and the mayor had smoked a marijuana cigarette the day of the
party and Barry drank four bottles of champagne, a fifth of cognac
and some wine, said Mitchell.
   After an ambulance rushed Barry to the hospital and oxygen was
administered, Barry felt better and said ``he didn't want any
tests,'' Mitchell testified. he said the mayor then left the
emergency room.
   Mitchell said he refused to give cocaine to the mayor when he
had city duties to perform. ``I love Marion Barry,'' he said.
   Darrell Sabbs testified that he and Barry snorted cocaine four
times.
   Sabbs said he worked for Barry on different city assignments
over the years and had developed ``almost a father-son
relationship'' with the mayor.
   Sabbs came to Washington on Jan. 19 to be on hand for Barry's
planned announcement that he would seek re-election.
   The announcement was never made because Barry was arrested in an
FBI sting operation the previous night 18 and charged with cocaine
possession.
   By the time Sabbs got to Washington, ``There had been this
entrap, sting or whatever,'' he told the jury.
   The spectators in the courtroom chuckled over Sabbs' reference
to entrapment, the defense Barry is using in seeking acquittal on
the FBI sting. The mayor was videotaped smoking crack cocaine.
   He is charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession, one count of
conspiracy and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury.
   Meanwhile Thursday, another U.S. District Court jury acquitted
David Rivers, former head of the city's Human Services Department,
on bribery and conspiracy charges in connection with the awarding
of $2 million in city contracts.
   Rivers had been charged with steering contracts to the firms of
friends or companies headed by his co-defendant and Barry
associate, developer John B. Clyburn. The jury reported it was
still deliberating charges against Clyburn.
   In the Barry trial, a witness alleged that Rivers and the mayor
used cocaine together.

<HEAD>Two Million Aging Australian Sheep to Be Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two million older sheep will be killed
in controlled shootings around the country to thin out the
country's sheep population estimated at a record 175 million head,
officials said today.
   Farmers said they will begin the mass shootings as early as next
week because many old ewes, held over when wool prices were higher,
are now being sold for as little as 10 cents each.
   ``It's sad, but some of the sheep aren't worth as much as a
bullet,'' said one farmer who was not identified. Earth movers will
likely be used to dig trenches to bury the sheep, other farmers
said.
   More than a million of the sheep will be killed in Western
Australia state, while several hundred thousand are expected to be
shot in New South Wales state and the remainder in other areas of
the country.
   Rob Sewell, spokesman for the New South Wales Farmers
Association, says most of the sheep to be killed are over the age
of 7. ``They've outlived their breeding purposes and are too old
for commercial production either for their wool or mutton,'' Sewell
said.
   ``This really is the only humane way out of the problem now,''
said Dr. Hugh Wirth, president of Australia's Royal Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, who said he will urge tight
government controls over the shootings.
   He said the sheep population crisis, which had been forecast
several years ago, had intensified recently when the floor price of
Australian wool was lowered and when live sheep trade to the Middle
East was disrupted due to diseased shipments.
   There were a record 175 million head of sheep in Australia as of
March of this year, a spokesman for Australian Bureau of Statistics
said today.
   ``There are a lot of old sheep around, many of them that cannot
be shorn anymore,'' said bureau spokesperson Elisabeth Davis. She
said the last reported mass killings of sheep, for which no figures
are available, occurred in 1972-73 when stocks were again too large.
   Wirth, who said recent bids at sales had only received from 10
to 20 cents a head, said Australia's rural community had not paid
enough attention to the sheep problem.
   ``We've been warning them for years,'' he said. ``It seems there
really isn't any other alternative but the bullet, although we
believe the industry must urgently explore alternatives.''
   Kevin Sheil, executive-director of the Sheepmeat Council of
Australia, said the industry had been looking at ways of avoiding
the problem by promoting mutton sales overseas. But those sales are
also down, including a $1.2 million (U.S.) shipment due to be sent
to the Soviet Union in two weeks that was canceled by Moscow.
   ``We understand that the public may be distressed to hear that
sheep may have to be destroyed,'' said Sheil. ``But the public must
understand that the farmers are also disturbed at the possibility
of shooting their own sheep.''

   Fidel Castro has changed his name to Mike
and is living in Bradenton working for a capitalist bank.
   No, not that Fidel.
   With the stroke of a pen Wednesday, Circuit Judge Stephen Dakan
changed the legal name of Bradenton's Fidel Castro _ named after
the Cuban president _ to Michael Anthony Castro.
   ``If you had a name like Fidel Castro, wouldn't you want to
change it?'' Castro said.
   ``I have heard every joke _ `Where's the beard?' `Where's the
cigar?'''
   Castro said he could handle the ribbing, but worried his career
might be hurt.
   ``I think from a business point of view, a lot of doors might
shut in my face because of the name,'' said Castro, a lending
representative for a bank.
   ``Should a position present itself, I wouldn't be too keen on
moving to Miami with the name Fidel Castro, knowing the intense
sentiment against him there,'' he said. Miami has a large Cuban
exile community.
   Antonio and Amparo Castro of Miami named their newborn son on
Jan. 22, 1961, after the man then considered a hero for
overthrowing dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959. But Castro later
changed Cuba into a Communist state.
   One person still will be calling Michael Castro by his former
name.
   ``My wife said whatever I wanted to do was fine, but I'll still
be Fidel to her,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Evan Mecham can run for governor again this fall
despite being impeached and removed from the office in 1988,
Arizona's Supreme Court ruled.
   Voters, not the courts, should decide whether the former
governor is worthy of holding public office again, the state's
highest court ruled Thursday in unanimously rejecting a challenge
to Mecham's comeback bid.
   ``Impeachment, essentially a political process, is not subject
to judicial review,'' the justices said. ``Any appeal from the
impeachment conviction lies in the electoral process.''
   Mecham was convicted by the state Senate of misusing about
$80,000 given him by supporters and trying to thwart an
investigation of an alleged death threat against an aide.
   He is one of five candidates seeking the Republican nomination
in the Sept. 11 primary.
   Mecham has a small but extremely loyal following and could win
the primary if the turnout is low and the other Republicans
splinter the vote, a pollster said.
   ``I don't think he's a leader in the race right now, but he's
still a contender,'' said Earl De Berge of the Behavior Research
Center in Phoenix. ``His hard core is hard core, and everything
depends on turnout.''
   But De Barge said Mecham almost certainly would lose the general
election.
   A retired Arizona highway patrol officer, Dennis Ingram, had
challenged Mecham's right to hold office again, saying the state
constitution automatically barred him from doing so because of his
impeachment and ouster.
   Mecham, 66, contended the ban was not automatic. He noted that
the Senate specifically failed to prohibit him from running again.
   The justices said the constitution was not clear on that point
and ``election, the ultimate weapon of democracy, is favored where
any doubt exists.''
   Mecham, campaigning in Yuma Thursday evening, was jubilant.
   ``The court made the only decision that we could see that they
could make,'' he said.
   ``We appreciate that, and now let's get on with the election and
let the people do the choosing of who their next governor's going
to be and get on with solving the critical problems of the state.''
   Ingram said through his lawyer, Michael Meehan, that he was
disappointed in the 5-0 decision.
   Mecham has said he believes a political opponent was behind
Ingram's challange. Meehan denied it. Ingram has declined to
discuss his motivation for filing the challenge.
   Mecham won the governorship on his fifth try in 1986. While in
office, the former auto dealer offended blacks, Hispanics, Jews and
women with inflammatory remarks, but he remained popular with many
conservatives.
   Gov. Rose Mofford, a Democrat who as secretary of state
automatically succeeded Mecham upon his removal, is stepping down.
Former Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard is the only major Democratic
candidate.
   The Senate convicted Mecham by a two-thirds vote but came up
three votes short of a two-thirds majority when it considered a
``Dracula clause'' that would have banned him from holding public
office.
   Vice Chief Justice Stanley Feldman, writing for the court, said
the constitution left it unclear whether the separate vote on the
``Dracula clause'' was even needed or whether the conviction vote
automatically meant Mecham could never hold office again.
   Given the uncertainty, he wrote, it is best to leave it ``to the
will of the people.''

<TEXT>
   America's original Medal of Honor, hidden away
for generations in an Ohio family's safety deposit box, is for the
first time going on display in the U.S. Capitol.
   The descendants of Jacob Parrott, the first medal recipient,
returned their heirloom to Congress on Thursday.
   Parrott, of Kenton, Ohio, was a 19-year-old Union Army volunteer
when his regiment sneaked into Georgia and captured a locomotive
200 miles behind the Confederate line.
   With the opposing Army in pursuit, the raiders ran the train for
90 miles, until it ran out of fuel. All 22 were captured and eight
were hanged.
   Secretary of War Edwin Stanton chose the raiders to be the first
to get the medal. Pvt. Parrott got the prototype medal because he
was the youngest in the group.
   Marilyn Frackelton of Westlake, Ohio, tearfully turned over to
House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., the medal presented to her
great-grandfather in 1863.
   During a formal ceremony attended by Foley, Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and 33 Medal of Honor recipients,
Mrs. Frackelton said she turned over the original medal ``with a
great sense of relief, of mission accomplished.''
   Through the generations, the Parrott medal was kept in the
family's bank safety deposit box. Its new home will be a
climate-controlled display case in the House Crypt beneathStatuary
Hall in the Capitol.

   The cymbals on about 9,200 Sesame Street
Rhythm Band sets will be replaced because a New York toy company
says the parts pose a choking hazard for small children.
   LEWCO Corp. said this week it would offer to replace the Oscar
the Grouch cymbals for its model 3553 band sets because ``the heads
detached from the cymbals'' and fail the Consumer Product Safety
Commission's small-parts test.
   The sets consist of a drum, drum sticks, maracas, slide whistle,
tambourines and the cymbals. Only the cymbals are subject to the
replacement program, the company said.
   There have been no injuries reported involving the sets but
consumers should discard the original cymbals and contact LEWCO
Corp., 1107 Broadway-Suite 905, New York, N.Y., 10010 for
replacements.
   In a similar action, another toy manufacturer recalled 2,364
dolls because various body parts detach easily and present a
choking hazard to young children.
   Allen-Lewis Manufacturing Co. of Denver, Colo., said its ``Cutie

tourists in small towns throughout the nation.
   The 6-inch dolls came with pacifiers and are dressed in a pink

   The North Carolina-based company has received 25 reports of the

<HEAD>Papp, Actors Lobby Against Art Endowment Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Theatrical producer Joseph Papp and a
delegation of performers are lobbying Congress against restrictions
on funding for the National Endowment for the Arts.
   Legislators on both sides of the issue have predicted Congress
will almost certainly impose restrictions when it votes on whether
to extend the federal arts agency's life for another five years.
   Critics of the agency want to restrict the content of works that
receive tax-paid grants from the endowment.
   Papp was accompanied by actors Kathleen Turner, Morgan Freeman
and Kevin Kline.
   He said they had lunch with the Congressional Arts Caucus and
Black Arts Caucus and encountered ``a mixed bag of opinion.''
   ``Everyone was for the NEA, but they weren't solid on
restrictions,'' he said.
   He said they had ``a very lively discussion'' at a meeting
attended by Speaker of the House Thomas Foley, D-Wash., and
lawmakers from both parties..
   Then, he said, they went to the office of Sen. Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo., where they ``met a number of senators who think differently
than we do,'' including Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   He said the group included Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and ``I
think we had some impact on her.''
   Asked whether they met with Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., one of the
endowment's sternest critics, Papp said, ``Unfortunately, he didn't
show up. He was invited, though. It would have been fun to talk
with him.''

<HEAD>Government Broadcast Operations to Combine Under VOA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Information Agency wants the
government's radio, televison and film service operations to be
consolidated under the Voice of America as a unified broadcasting
group.
   The reorganization, proposed Thursday, would combine the
government's Satellite Television and Film Service, Radio Marti, TV
Marti under the direction of VOA chief Richard W. Carlson.
   The move would ``better position the agency'' to be more
effective in a rapidly changing world, USIA Director Bruce Gelb
said in a statement.
   ``Hopefully, we will be also be able to bring about operating
efficiencies that will allow us to make better use of our
resources,'' Gelb added.
   The four divisions involved in the consolidation have a combined
budget of $222 million and employ 3,500 people.
   Gelb told The Washigton Post in an interview published in
Friday's editions that no current employees would lose their jobs
in the reorganization.
   Two other broadcasting networks _ Radio Free Europe and Radio
Liberty _ operate under the Board for International Broadcasting,
an organization separate from the USIA.
   Gelb said the new broadcast group would begin operation Oct. 1,
the start of the 1991 fiscal year, pending congressional approval.

<HEAD>Four Opposition Lamwakers Quit, Radicals Hurl Firebombs, Broadcast
Strike</HEAD>

   Angry over government plans to revamp
the nation's broadcast system, four opposition lawmakers quit,
hundreds of broadcast workers walked out and radical students
clashed with police.
   The lawmakers' resignations capped a week of controversy over
government-sponsored bills which restructure the nation's broadcast
industry and the military's operational command.
   Opposition groups claim the government of President Roh Tae-woo
is railroading the bills through the legislature.
   Broadcast union leaders claim the bills are timed to strengthen
the government's grip on broadcasting prior to next year's national
elections.
   They say the bills will effectively allow the government to
control ownership and censor programming of broadcast networks.
   The government claims the bills are aimed at rejuvenating South
Korea's broadcast industry, introducing new programming and
allowing the formation of new privately owned stations and cable
television.
   In the provincial capital of Kwangju, about 200 radical students
hurling firebombs at a government building today were dispersed by
riot police firing tear gas, said the Joong-ang Daily News.
   ``Evil laws!,'' students shouted, according to the reprot.
   Hundreds of broadcast workers shouting anti-government slogans
walked off the job today at Munwha Broadcast Corp. television.
Also, a strike vote was being taken among 5,000 union workers at
the state-run Korean Broadcasting System Co., the largest of the
country's three networks.
   Most of MBC's news programs were shortened or canceled and
senior management officials took over programming jobs, the network
said.
   A statement released by the four lawmakers charged that the
assembly has become a ``rubber-stamping body to pass undemocratic
administration-sponsored law bills.''
   They said it was the result of a merger of President Roh's
governing party with two conservative opposition parties in
February. The merger gave the new party control of 218 of the total
299 votes.
   Opposition lawmakers, dissidents and radical students have
called the merger a political coup.
   Under the law, lawmakers' resignations are subject to consent
through plenary session voting when the assembly is in session. The
assembly was not expected to vote before its current session ends
Monday.
   When the broadcasting bills were passed by committee on
Wednesday, governing party members ignored procedural norms and
used a quick standing vote. A scuffle broke out and one lawmaker
was injured.
   Many Koreans eager for more choice in programs watch Japanese
satellite television and the American military television. The
government views both as cultural erosion.
   South Korean media came under strict government control in 1980,
after disgraced former president Chun Doo-hwan seized power. Chun
closed private networks and placed virtually all radio and
television stations under state management.
   Roh succeeded Chun in 1988 and has introduced press freedom and
other reforms. Networks have aired news reports critical of the
government.
   In April, about 5,000 KBS workers staged a strike to challenge
the head of the network, who had been appointed by Roh. They
demanded a more reform-minded figure run the network. Riot police
were used to squelch the 19-day strike.

<HEAD>Unlike Other Cancers, Oral Cancer Survival Rates Not Improving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many cancer patients in the United States are
increasingly likely to survive, but for about 30,000 hit by throat
and mouth cancer every year the chances are roughly 50-50 _ and not
getting any better.
   Oral and pharynx cancers killed 9,742 Americans in 1987, the
latest year for which statistics are available, the national
Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   That fatality rate _ 3.6 deaths per 100,000 people _ is
unchanged from 1973, said CDC dental health specialist Linda
Crossett.
   But the survival rate hasn't changed much since then either, the
Atlanta-based disease center said.
   Only 52 percent of oral cancer patients survive five years or
more. That's in contrast to the survival rates for breast, prostate
and colorectal cancers, which are improving, officials said.
   Survival rates are lowest for blacks, and getting worse.
Statistics for 1981 through 1986 showed that just 31 percent of
black patients survived oral cancer, compared with 35 percent in
1974-76.
   For white patients, the survival rates have remained more
constant: 53 percent from 1981 through 1986, down from 55 percent
during 1974-76.
   ``We're not making a lot of progress,'' Crossett said, adding
that about 30,000 new cases a year are diagnosed in the United
States.
   Major risk factors for oral cancer include use of tobacco,
either smoked or smokeless, and drinking.
   ``The combined risks from tobacco and alcohol use appear to be
substantially greater than those from tobacco or alcohol alone,''
the CDC said in its weekly report.
   ``The increased use of tobacco among women, adolescents and
children'' _ as compared to a decline in smoking overall _ ``is
likely to elevate death rates for these cancers in the next several
decades,'' the report said.
   Another major reason for oral cancer deaths ``is the fact that
there has not been any improvement in early detection,'' Crossett
said. ``Most are only detected ... after they've grown pretty
large, so advanced that it's obvious.''
   Dentists traditionally have been most likely to perform
extensive oral exams, but the CDC documented in 1986 that people at
highest risk for oral cancer seek the services of a physician four
times more often than a dentist.
   ``And many people going to their physician may not get a
thorough oral, head and neck exam,'' Crossett said.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albanian refugees who escaped
Europe's last stronghold of Communism hope that even in their tiny
country the days of one-party rule are numbered.
   A group of 51 Albanians who had sought refuge in the
Czechoslovak Embassy in the Albanian capital Tirana were
transported to Prague early Monday on Czechoslovak President Vaclav
Havel's plane.
   They were the first of about 4,500 asylum-seekers sheltering in
foreign embassies allowed to leave their country. They speculate
that the exodus could be the harbinger of the demise of Communism
in their abandoned country.
   Hundreds more refugees arrived in Italy by ship today.
   ``I give Communism in my country one or two years,'' said Kola,
a 36-year-old construction worker who is housed together with the
other refugees in a workers' barracks on the outskirts of Prague.
Like others, he declined to give his full name out of fear of
possible reprisals against his family at home.
   ``It was intolerable. We all dreaded the isolation,'' Kola said
in fairly fluent Italian. He was one of the few who spoke anything
but Albanian.
   Kola claimed he spent five years in jail for publicly
criticizing the late Albanian leader Enver Hoxha.
   ``Some people spent up to 40 years in jail for similar
offenses,'' he added.
   During his 40 years of leadership, Hoxha steered his country
into increasing isolation internationally and suppressed dissent to
maintain absolute rule of the Communists.
   The country's current leader, Ramiz Alia, who took over after
Hoxha's death in 1985, has opened his country considerably to the
outside world and initiated some modest reforms, mostly in the
economy. But he has rejected any far-reaching political changes.
   Other refugees confirmed that the leadership continues to
exercise a tight grip on its people's freedoms.
   Residents of Tirana are not permitted to travel further than 25
miles out of town without a special permit, they said, and the
omnipresent secret police, known as Sigurimi, kept a close watch
over their private lives.
   ``The Romanian Securitate was like The Salvation Army compared
to them,'' Kola said. He was referring to the hated secret police
of Romania's ousted Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu who was
executed after his overthrow by a bloody revolution.
   The reference to the Romanian Securitate indicated that Kola and
other Albanians were able to keep themselves informed of what was
happening in the world, despite the tight reigns on the
Communist-run press in Albania.
   Kola said his knowledge of Havel, garnered from foreign
broadcasts that can be received in Tirana, was one reason for his
choosing the Czechoslovak Embassy to seek refuge.
   ``Everybody listens to Italian and Yugoslav radio in Tirana and
we knew very well what happened in Czechoslovakia,'' he said.
   But he admitted his reasons were not merely political: ``Quite
frankly, the fence around the Czechoslovak Embassy was one of the
lowest, too,'' he laughed.
   When the Albanian refugees arrived at the Ruzyne airport in
Prague Monday, many of them carried pictures of Havel and chants of
``Long live Havel'' were still heard from the jubilant arrivals as
a bus was taking them off to their quarters.
   Czechoslovak authorities provided each of them with about $1,700
worth of basic clothing, medical help and a little pocket money.
All of the refugees were said to be in good health.
   ``It is just too bad we do not have such intellectuals and
dissidents in our country,'' Kola said of Havel, a former dissident
playwright turned statesmen in the wake of Czechoslovakia's
peaceful revolution last year that ousted Communists from power.
   ``Most of them are corrupted,'' Kola said of intellectuals in
his country.
   Kola said he had not yet decided where he wanted to settle, but
indicated that he did not plan to stay in Czechoslovakia. ``I`d
like to go to the U.S.,'' he said.
   But Kola made clear that ideally he would like to consider his
homeland an option as well.
   ``Certainly I hope the Communist rule ends soon and we can all
be free like you,'' he concluded.

   Legally barred from suing the government,
people whose health may have suffered because of huge radiation
releases from Hanford nuclear reservation began considering other
ways to get compensation.
   Scientists today were to start trying to determine just how much
radiation people who lived downwind from Hanford were exposed to by
releases into the air in the 1940s and into the Columbia River in
the 1960s.
   The federal government disclosed the magnitude of radiation
releases Thursday, revealing for the first time that people and
farmland were exposed to significant levels of potentially
cancer-causing nuclear contamination.
   ``We really believe we're getting the truth now,'' said Tom
Bailie, a farmer and spokesman for people living east of the
southern Washington reservation.
   Residents are legally barred from suing the government for
damages suffered by radiation exposure, but could win compensation
through congressional action, Bailie said.
   Pending legislation in Congress would pay uranium miners for
radiation-related illnesses, though they also are blocked from
suing the government by the so-called doctrine of sovereign
immunity, he said.
   ``The federal government owes something if folks have been
harmed by these early releases of radiation,'' Rep. Sid Morrison, a
Republican whose district includes the reservation, said in
Washington, D.C.
   ``While these estimates are preliminary and they will change,
the potential for harmful side effects is with us to stay,'' he
said.
   An independent panel of scientists was scheduled to meet here
today to begin the second phase of a five-year study. They will try
to determine individual radiation exposure and health risks for
those who lived downwind from the 560-square-mile site.
   The first phase studied airborne radioactive iodine emissions
from 1944 to 1947 and radioactive cooling water poured into the
Columbia River from 1964-67.
   The five-year, $15 million study is being paid for, but not
directed, by the U.S. Department of Energy, which operates the
reservation.
   Hanford was established late in World War II as part of the
Manhattan Project to build atomic bombs.
   Fuel rods irradiated in as many as nine nuclear reactors at the
site were taken to several top-secret plants where plutonium and
uranimum were extracted to fuel nuclear bombs.
   The iodine and other radioactive materials was released into the
air through unfiltered stacks, officials said.
   A few infants were hit hardest, with doses as high as 2,900 rad
over three years. One rad is the amount of radiation a body organ
would absorb from about a dozen chest X-rays.
   The panel concluded that most people living near the Hanford
site from 1944 to 1947 were exposed to low doses of radiation. The
study covered 270,000 people living in 10 Washington and Oregon
counties.
   In releasing the first phase report, John Till, a South Carolina
scientist and nuclear consultant, cautioned that the results should
not be used to make health risk estimates.
   But as many as 13,500 people, or 5 percent of the population,
may have received doses of more than 33 rad in milk after cows
grazed in contaminated pastures, he said.
   About 1,400 infants and children living in the area received 15
to 650 rad, with only a small number suffering the 2,900-rad doses,
Till said.
   When it concentrates in the thyroid gland, radioactive
iodine-131 can cause cancer and other diseases.
   Scientists hope that within a year they will be able to tell
people who lived in the area what their highest potential radiation
doses likely were.
   Such information would greatly help doctors treat affected
residents, Dr. George Laramore, professor of radiological oncology
at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.
   Bailie led an impromptu press conference of downwind residents
angered by the report that came decades after radiation was
routinely released in the rural agricultural area.
   ``I feel like they used us for guinea pigs, and I don't feel
like they cared one iota what happened to us either, or our
families,'' said Betty Perkes, a farmer in Pasco.

<HEAD>Doubter Fights Friday the 13th Superstitions By Tempting Fate</HEAD>

   Those who dread today _ Friday the 13th _
don't have to cringe under the covers until Saturday, thanks to
superstition-smasher Jerry Karol.
   The prop store owner's 13-step, tongue-in-cheek remedy for
triskaidekaphobia may seem to tempt fate, though.
   In Karol's ``Theme Factory,'' a showroom where he creates props
for unusual parties, museum exhibits and other events, he has set
up what he describes as a ``disease-killing display leading to a 13
cure.''
   People who want to break the fearful habit are invited to stop
by and:
   _Break a mirror.
   _Walk under a ladder.
   _Let a black cat cross your path.
   _Whistle indoors.
   _Toss three coins in a fountain.
   _Spill salt.
   _Walk a plank.
   _Stir a caldron of witch's brew.
   _Step on a crack in a block of cement.
   _Circle a tombstone.
   _Open an umbrella indoors.
   _Kiss a moose.
   _Hop on one foot while counting backwards from 13.
   Karol admits he doesn't really believe in the allegedly unlucky
day, so the truly superstitious might not want to try his cure.
   Then again, Karol says, ``Why not?''
   ``Anything is worth a try, and if you can do it, especially on
Friday the 13th, it should cure triskaidekaphobia, which is only in
the mind, anyway.''
   ``It's long been held that the best way to get rid of anxieties
and frustration is through laughter and fun,'' he said. ``It's
important to look at our fears and put them in perspective. Then
one realizes that most superstitious fears are figments of our
imagination.''
   Those who try the remedy will be asked to make a contribution to
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, or their favorite charity, Karol
said.

   A police dragnet based on astrological research
failed to turn up the Zodiac killer and cost the city as much as
$30,000 in overtime for undercover officers sent out as decoy prey.
   ``Maybe he read in the papers that we were beefing up,'' Chief
of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said Thursday after the all-night
hunt.
   ``I'm happy he didn't shoot anyone. I'm not happy we haven't
caught him yet,'' Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown said.
   Investigators activated ``Operation Watchdog'' because they
feared the gunman would strike according to a 21-day, Thursday
pattern he has followed over four months in attacks on four people.
   In another prominent New York crime spree, police arrested a
33-year-old man with a history of psychiatric problems as a suspect
in the ``Dartman'' dart-blowing attacks.
   In the past few weeks, 55 well-dressed women have reported being
jabbed by homemade darts in the buttocks, legs and arms as they
walked down streets, mostly in midtown Manhattan.
   Of the ``Night of the Zodiac,'' Borrelli refused to say how many
officers scoured the city in search of the gunman, who said in
letters to police and news organizations that he chooses his
victims by their astrological signs.
   All four of the Zodiac's victims, including one who died, were
shot on Thursday nights between midnight and dawn.
   The 21-day cycle of shootings started March 8, with other
shootings on March 29, May 31 and June 21. The time between the
second and third shootings was 63 days, a multiple of 21.
   The gunman vowed in letters to police and news media to shoot 12
people _ one for each sign of the Zodiac.
   At least two men who resembled a sketch of Zodiac were picked up
by detectives, questioned and released during the dragnet. Borrelli
estimated the operation cost the city as much as $30,000 in
overtime for officers.
   Borrelli said the absence of a Zodiac shooting early Thursday
``is not inconsistent with him because there was that period'' of
63 days between the second and third shootings.
   In the Dartman case, authorities said Jerome Wright, 33, of the
Bronx, a messenger with a criminal record and admitted psychiatric
problems, was charged Thursday in the firing of darts made from
straight pins, sewing needles and paper.
   Wright was identified in a lineup by three women Wednesday night
and was charged with three counts each of reckless endangerment,
criminal possession of a weapon and harassment.
   ``We believe he is our darter,'' said Manhattan Chief of
Detectives Joseph DeMartino.

<TEXT>
   The army and navy have launched a
major offensive against the rebel Tamil Tigers, killing more than
70 insurgents, capturing two camps and blowing up six boats,
military officials said today.
   The government operation began Thursday in the Trincomalee
district, about 140 miles northeast of Colombo, according to the
military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A total of 130 Tigers and government troops have been killed
since Wednesday night, according to government tallies.
   There was no independent confirmation of the reports. Contact
with the Tigers has been tapering off because of the fighting and
also due to poor communications.
   The Tigers have been fighting seven years for a separate
homeland for their ethnic minority in northeastern Sri Lanka,
claiming they need to protect Tamils from discrimination by the
Sinhalese majority.
   The government claimed the Tigers lost 40 men when the
government attacked two guerrilla camps near the deep-water port
city. At least 33 more Tigers were killed when navy gunboats
destroyed six rebel boats in a lagoon, the officials said.
   They said 45 soldiers were killed when the Tigers overran a camp
at Kokkavil, about 180 miles northeast of Colombo. A survivor was
quoted as saying the rebels used armor-plated bulldozers to mount
the assault.
   Government troops fanned out to look for more survivors.
Officials said a search party early today killed eight rebels at
Mankulam, 12 miles south of Kokkavil.
   In the far north, a Tiger sniper killed one soldier at the
200-year-old Dutch colonial fort, the only government-held post in
Jaffna town. The town has been a rebel stronghold since the Tigers
launched their offensive in 1983.
   Three other soldiers were killed in the northwestern town of
Mannar and in the northeast, the government said. No breakdown was
given.
   About 2,400 combatants have been reported killed since July 11
when the Tigers overran a chain of police stations, shattering a
13-month-old cease-fire. Many civilians also have died, but no
figures were available.
   The mainly Hindu Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people and say they have been denied equality in jobs and
education. The predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese account for 75
percent of the population and have run the Indian Ocean island
since it became independent from Britain in 1948.
   More than 17,000 people have been killed in the 7-year-old
confrontation.

<HEAD>Irish Envoy In Beirut Seeking Word Of Hostage</HEAD>

   An Irish envoy was in Moslem west Beirut
today seeking further information on whether kidnapped Irish
teacher Brian Keenan will soon be freed after four years' captivity.
   The envoy, Adrian McDaid, arrived in Beirut Thursday, five days
after Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said in a brief
dispatch from Beirut that pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups might
release one of 16 Westerners missing in Lebanon.
   ``I'm here to collect information about the possible release of
Brian Keenan,'' said McDaid, the first secretary at the Irish
Embassy in Baghdad, which is also responsible for Lebanon.
   IRNA did not say which hostage could be freed but said he would
probably be one of 10 missing Europeans. Sources close to the
Syrian Army headquarters in Beirut have speculated that Keenan
would be the one freed.
   ``We don't have official confirmation that it will be him, but
we're hopeful that it will be him,'' McDaid said.
   Apart from Keenan, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss and
an Italian are missing in Lebanon, along with six Americans. The
longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Keenan, a 39-year-old English language teacher from Belfast, was
kidnapped in west Beirut April 11, 1986, as he walked to work at
the American University of Beirut.
   No group has claimed to hold him or made any demands for his
release.
   Former hostage Frank Reed, an American educator freed April 30,
said he saw Keenan two days before his release, which was announced
by a group calling itself Islamic Dawn.
   McDaid, interviewed at the Irish consulate in west Beirut, said
the duration of his stay in Lebanon ``depends on the developments.''
   Declan Connolly, the Irish Ambassador to Syria, said he was in
constant touch with the Syrian Foreign Ministry in Damascus.
   Syria, Iran's main Arab ally, has played a role in previous
hostage releases. The Syrians have 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a
1976 Arab League mandate to quell a civil war between Christians
and Moslems that broke out in 1975.
   Officials and diplomats in Damascus said Thursday a release was
not likely before next week because President Hafez Assad, Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa and other senior government officials
were scheduled to be in Cairo Saturday and Sunday.
   In another development, Beirut's al-Liwa daily said the Belgian
government and the Palestinian faction of terrorist mastermind Abu
Nidal have struck a deal for the release of four Belgians held by
the group for more than 2{ years.
   The front-page report, attributed to unidentified Western
diplomatic sources, said the four would be freed July 21 after
Belgian King Baudouin issues a ``special pardon'' for Palestinian
Nasser Sa'eed, who is serving a life sentence for a grenade attack
on young Jews June 27, 1980.
   Al-liwa does not have a record of accurate reporting on the
hostage issue.

   The killing of a militant Wesleyan
University student was related to drugs, not his civil rights
activism, police said after charging two suspects.
   Police said Nicholas B. Haddad's death was plotted by cohorts
who feared reprisal after they lost or misspent a large sum of the
money he invested in a drug-dealing operation.
   Haddad's body was found in his car July 6. Carl Lightner, 20,
and Kumar Viswanathan, 21, were charged Thursday with murder and
conspiracy in Haddad's death, officials said. Neither suspect is a
Wesleyan student.
   Lightner has been in custody since July 7 on an unrelated drug
charge and was scheduled for arraignment today, with bail set at
$550,000. Viswanathan remained at large. His bail was set at
$750,000.
   Haddad, 21, a Lebanese-American, had organized several rallies
and taken part in a hunger strike at the university to protest
racism on campus, prompting initial speculation that his activism
was tied to his death.
   Hartford State's Attorney John M. Bailey ruled out that theory
Thursday.
   ``We found no motive concerning the deceased's activities at
Wesleyan University and there was absolutely no racial motive in
this case,'' Bailey said.
   Found in Haddad's car was a cache of weapons, including an Uzi
semiautomatic, police said.
   Police Lt. Frederick Lewis theorized that Lightner and
Viswanathan were to buy and sell drugs purchased with money
supplied by Haddad, who was to receive a percentage of the profits.
   The two men plotted Haddad's slaying because they lost or
misspent an undisclosed large sum of his money, Lewis said.
   Haddad, a Lebanese-American from Red Hook, N.Y., was co-editor
of a the student publication ``The Afrikan Nation.'' He and nine
other students went on a nine-day hunger strike in May following
the discovery of racist graffiti on a black student dormitory.
   Activists said the graffiti was the product of a climate of
racial intolerance at the elite private school with an enrollment
of 2,700.
   In another episode, black students complained that police had
unfairly singled out Haddad and several other minority-group
members as suspects in two April firebombings on campus.

<HEAD>Military to Victorious Opposition: Don't Try To Declare Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military junta today told the
opposition that scored a landslide election win six weeks ago not
to try to declare a government.
   Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the head of military intelligence, said
the junta would not yield to international demands that it transfer
power to the National League for Democracy and release the
opposition group's general secretary, Aung San Suu Kyi.
   Ms. Suu Kyi, the daughter of Burma's foremost independence hero,
has been under house arrest for nearly a year, since last July 20.
   ``The (junta) is a military government ruling the country under
martial law. No attempt for a unilateral declaration of government
will be tolerated,'' Khin Nyunt told the weekly government news
briefing in Rangoon.
   He acknowledged international pressure to transfer power and
free Ms. Suu Kyi, ``but we do not care at all about such threats.''
   The pressure amounted to ``undue interference in the internal
affairs of our country,'' Khin Nyunt said.
   The junta took power in 1988, brutally crushing a national
uprising for democracy. It allowed the nation's first free election
in 30 years to be held May 27. The National League trounced the
miltiary, winning 396 of 485 parliamentary seats.
   The military government says the newly elected parliament must
approve a constitution before it can govern. In the past, it had
said the parliament could choose between two previous constitutions
or draw up a new one.
   The National League has said it wishes to adapt the constitution
of 1947, used after Burma gained independence from Britain the
following year.
   But Khin Nyunt said ``both the 1947 and 1974 constitutions are
no longer adaptable to the country's present situation,'' adding:
``Hence an entirely new constitution which would not entail legal
problems arising out of its shortcomings must be drawn.''
   The military would be willing to hold talks with political
leaders only when all election expenses and objections had been
cleared by the Elections Commission, Khin Nyunt said.
   He said Ms. Suu Kyi was being detained ``according to the law,''
and that she had been treated with lenience.
   ``Though she is restricted to her home, all facilities are being
provided for,'' he said. Khin Nyunt said she was able to receive
gift parcels from her British husband through the British Embassy.
   He said Ms. Suu Kyi would be allowed to hold a religious
ceremony on July 19 to commemorate the anniversary of the
assassination of her father Aung San 43 years ago.
   The junta detained Ms. Suu Kyi after she vowed to lead a mass
anti-government rally to commemorate the last anniversary of her
father's death.

<HEAD>Soviet-Japanese-North Korean Fishing Flap Apparently Settled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet authorities today permitted a dozen North
Korean-flagged fishing vessels and their mainly Japanese crews to
leave a Soviet port where they had been held for alleged poaching,
Japanese officials said.
   But the ships were bound for North Korea, and it was uncertain
when the Japanese crewmen would be brought home.
   Shigeo Takenaka, acting Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman,
told foreign journalists the North Koreans said they would return
the fishermen to Japan ``without delay'' after arrival at the port
of Hungnam in North Korea.
   The ministry said earlier the crewmen were wary of going to
North Korea.
   Japan's consul general in the Soviet Far East port of Nakhodka
strongly protested that the crewmen were not being brought directly
to Japan, and Japanese coast guard vessels were dispatched to try
to monitor the voyage.
   The incident, which started in mid-May, was a three-way dispute
between the Soviet Union, North Korea and Japan over fishing in
salmon-rich waters off the Soviet coast.
   The seized vessels flew North Korean flags and had North Korean
officers, but they had been leased from Japanese companies and
about three-quarters of the crew was Japanese.
   Soviet authorities directed their complaints about the alleged
poaching to their ally North Korea, while Japanese authorities
scrambled to try to get the crew released. Japan and Communist
North Korea have no diplomatic relations. The Japanese Foreign
Ministry said North Korea would pay compensation to the Soviets for
the illegal fishing. But no amount was announced.
   North Korea has no fishing agreement with the Soviet Union, and
North Korean boats had been permitted to fish for salmon, experts
said.
   It was speculated that such informal arrangements enticed
Japanese operators to put their vessels under North Korean flag and
take more salmon than what was permitted in the Japanese-Soviet
agreement.
   But Japanese authorities said it was illegal to lease fishing
vessels to North Korea without permission, which had not been given.
   The Japanese crew's fears were proably raised by the fact that
two Japanese fishermen were imprisoned in North Korea after they
allowed a North Korean to stow away on their boat and defect to
Japan.
   The two went back to North Korea to fish after the incident and
were arrested, tried for espionage and sentenced to 15 years in
prison.
   North Korea has suggested they would be released in exchange for
the defector, but Japan has refused.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Refugees Volunteer to Return Home from Thailand,
Malaysia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 Vietnamese are expected
to return to their homeland in the first voluntary repatriation of
Vietnamese refugees from Thailand since 1975, a U.N. official said
today.
   Sixty other boat people will return home Sunday from Malaysia,
the United Nations said. That would bring to 167 the number of boat
people who have returned from Malaysian camps voluntarily since the
beginning of 1989.
   Southeast Asian countries burdened by thousands of Vietnamese
who fled their Communist homeland have threatened to forcibly
repatriate refugees unless the United States and other countries
help resettle them.
   Fifty-nine refugees are awaiting authorization from Vietnam to
return while another 130 have indicated they want to go back, the
U.N. statement said.
   In the departures from Thailand, an official of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees said 113 refugees from the Phanat Nikhom
refugee camp had volunteered to return to Vietnam and would be
interviewed by Vietnamese immigration officials in Thailand early
next week.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
expected the refugees would return to Vietnam within one or two
months.
   There are now some 14,000 Vietnamese refugees in Thailand. Less
than 2,000 are currently eligible for third-country resettlement.
   All Vietnamese who arrived in Thailand after March 14, 1989 must
be screened to determine their eligibility for resettlement. Most
of the Vietnamese refugees now in Thailand arrived after that
cutoff date.
   The group of 113 had not yet been screened, the official said.
It appeared they were returning due to the lengthy screening
process and because they were pessimistic about the prospect for
eventual resettlement, another relief official said.
   The U.N. official said the number of Vietnamese arriving in
Thailand had increased in the first five months of this year to an
average of about 1,000. He said it appeared the Vietnamese now
perceived Thailand to be more receptive to them than countries
Malaysia and Hong Kong.
   There are about 17,500 Vietnamese refugees in Malaysian camps.
Of these, 14,000 arrived after the March 1989 cutoff date.
   Vietnamese began fleeing their homeland after the Communist
victory over U.S.-backed forces in South Vietnam in 1975.

   A murderer called the death penalty racist
before he was strapped into the electric chair and executed early
today.
   Wallace Norrell Thomas, 35, quoted from the Bible and read a
1{-page statement as relatives and other witnesses looked on.
   ``Let my death serve as an instigator that will awaken a nation
to fight and adopt the philosophy of the late, great Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., who said, `Injustice anywhere is a threat to
justice everywhere,''' Thomas said.
   Thomas, who was black, called capital punishment a ``racist,
violent penalty.'' He wore a purple ribbon and a sticker saying,
``Execute justice, not people.''
   Alabama death row inmates clanged the bars of their cells and
yelled as the execution time drew near.
   Thomas was condemned for the Dec. 20, 1976, abduction and
gunshot slaying of Quenette Shehane, 21, who had graduated from
Birmingham-Southern College just a few days before. She was
kidnapped at a convenience store near the campus.
   One of two other men charged in the case implicated Thomas in
the shooting. Thomas' co-defendants are serving life sentences.
   The U.S. Supreme Court, which rejected an appeal in the case in
April, on Thursday rejected Thomas' plea for a delay.
   Later, Gov. Guy Hunt restated his intention to let the execution
proceed, and the state Supreme Court denied an emergency stay
motion.
   In the appeal, Thomas' lawyer, Bryan Stevenson, argued that the
electric chair is inhumane, based on two instances in which inmates
were not killed with the first flip of the switch. He also
challenged a judge's instructions to jurors for Thomas' trial.
   Thomas was the 133rd person executed since the Supreme Court in
1976 allowed states to resume use of the death penalty, the eighth
in Alabama.
   While on death row at Holman Prison near Atmore, Thomas helped
found Project Hope, an anti-death penalty group for inmates and
their families. The organization seeks to educate the public about
capital punishment and tries to bring condemned inmates and their
relatives together.
   Miss Shehane's mother, Miriam Shehane, has become Alabama's
leading advocate for victims' rights. Mrs. Shehane helped found the
group Victims of Crime and Leniency.

<HEAD>Toy Rocket Ignites California Blaze, Lightning Fires Rage
Elsewhere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager's toy rocket touched off a roaring fire that
blackened 7,000 acres of brush in Southern California, and
lightning-sparked blazes rampaged through the Okefenokee Swamp in
Georgia today.
   Five people, including the 15-year-old boy accused of starting
the fire with the model rocket, were injured in the fire that broke
out Thursday in Chino Hills State Park, about 40 miles southeast of
downtown Los Angeles.
   The boy, whose name was withheld because of his age, was
arrested for investigation of unlawful use of a model rocket and
was released to his parents.
   ``He did admit to starting the fire,'' Orange County fire
spokeswoman Maria Sabol said. ``He tried to put the fire out and
sustained minor burns to his right leg.''
   Seven hundred firefighters were expected to surround the blaze
today, said fire dispatcher Lori Malavenda.
   Three prison inmates fighting the fire were overcome by smoke
and were treated at the scene. Another inmate firefighter fractured
an elbow in a fall.
   The fire was near the Carbon Canyon area, where 6,000 acres were
consumed in the last three days of June by an arson fire. Charred
land there acted as a fire stop, keeping the new fire from
spreading in that direction, fire officials said.
   A wildfire triggered by lightning last weekend in the Okefenokee
Swamp burned out of control today, adding to 3,900 acres of charred
brush.
   The Georgia fire on Mitchell Island, about six miles from the
Florida state line, spread from 1,700 acres on Wednesday to 3,900
acres by Thursday afternoon, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Don
Corban.
   A new lightning-sparked blaze erupted in Yellowstone National
Park on Thursday and had blackened at least 15 acres of forest by
today, officials said.
   Air tankers were dispatched to drop fire retardant on flames
about eight miles north of Yellowstone Lake, park spokesman Joan
Anzelmo said.
   The latest fire was the park's 12th of the year, but only the
second to surpass two acres.
   As many as 300 lightning-caused fires dotted the Cascades
Mountains in Washington and Oregon on Thursday, but most were small
and did not threaten any buildings, U.S. Forest Service spokesman
Ralph Satterberg said.
   The largest fire was a 100-acre blaze in the William O. Douglas
Wilderness Area of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in
southwestern Washington state, he said.
   Another blaze charred about 50 acres of forest near the Henry M.
Jackson Wilderness Area of the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National
Forest, about 40 miles east of Everett, Wash., said Ron DeHart,
another forest service spokesman.
   In Oregon, the largest fire was a 55-acre blaze burning in
Douglas County south of Roseburg, said Doug Decker of the Oregon
State Forestry Department.
   In Alaska, wildfires continued to burn, many unattended. There
have been 615 wildfires in Alaska this season, scorching a combined
545,706 acres, according to Bureau of Land Managment figures.

   Rain sprinkled the eastern third of the nation early today and
temperatures cooled in the Pacific Northwest after a scorching day
of temperatures shooting well past the century mark.
   The northern Plains, Rockies and desert Southwest were mostly
dry, but severe thunderstorms, with a chance of tornadoes, were
expected in eastern Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi.
   Heavy showers also could develop in the Virginias.
   At midnight Thursday, temperatures had dipped to 83 degrees in
Pendleton, Ore., and to 79 at Boise, Idaho. Earlier in Washington
state, Pasco hit 116, Hanford reached 110 and it was 108 in Walla
Walla.
   Torrid temperatures were expected to cool in the Northwest
today, and thunderstorms over eastern Washington state were moving
toward Montana.
   In the Southwest, temperatures were likely to soar past 100.
   Death Valley, Calif., had a high of 125 degrees on Thursday, and
in Arizona, Bullhead City and Lake Havasu City hit 116.
   Rain fell across much of the Northeast early today, and was
scattered across the South and Ohio Valley. Rain also fell in parts
of the Midwest.
   A cold front extending from the Great Lakes was likely to push
cool air across the Plains to northern Texas, bringing unseasonably
cool temperatures.
   Moist air from the South will collide with a stationary front
stretching across the Appalachias from western Tennessee to
northern Virginia. Heavy rains were expected just north of the
front.

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers voted today to sell off Poland's
state-owned industries, a major step in the Solidarity-led
government's 7-month-old radical reform program.
   More than 80 percent of the country's industry is
government-owned, including steel mills, coal mines and factories.
Government officials said no sectors of the economy would be
off-limits to privatization.
   The Sejm, or the lower house of parliament, passed the
legislation 328-2, with 39 abstentions. The vote came one day after
the long-delayed measure reached the floor.
   The privatization measure still needs Senate approval, but with
99 of 100 senators elected from the non-Communist Solidarity
movement, it was not expected to have any difficulty.
   Companies in the best financial shape would be put on the
auction block first.
   ``I think this is the most fundamental bill ever passed by the
Polish parliament, said Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz.
``This is a foundation of the new economic system in Poland.''
   Introducing the bills a day earlier, Balcerowicz told lawmakers
that the ownership changes must come quickly.
   ``Without a decisive change in the ownership of the economy,
further progress of the reforms is not possible,'' he said.
   Poland, whose Communist regime was replaced by the Solidarity
government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in August, embarked
in January on a radical economic reform program. The first goal was
to stabilize runaway inflation.
   The program whittled inflation down to 3.4 percent in June,
compared to 600 percent to 1,000 percent inflation in 1989. But the
social cost has been high _ real incomes have dropped by 30 percent.
   The privatization measure bogged down for some time because of
disputes over how to proceed. Many people feared foreign investors
or the former Communist elite would be the only ones with the
capital to buy state property. But the government promised that
``privatization coupons,'' which can be used toward purchase of
state-owned property, would be issued to all citizens.
   ``In this way, the idea of citizen's stock ownership will be put
into practice,'' said Balcerowicz.
   He also promised that Polish citizens would be allowed to buy
shares on an installment basis and, in some cases, on favorable
credit terms.
   Employees of enterprises would be allowed to buy up to 20
percent of the shares of their companies on preferential terms.
Foreign investment will be at the discretion of the government
agency overseeing the transactions.
   Although the government wants to sell off state companies as
quickly as possible, it will take time.
   Krzysztof Lis, who heads the privatization office, estimates
that even after three years, less than 50 percent of Poland's 7,600
enterprises will be in private hands.

   Officials are easing water-use
retrictions for most of south Florida because recent rains have
raised underground water levels.
   Under the South Florida Water Management District's relaxed
rules that begin Monday, car and boat washing is permitted any
time, and lawn sprinkling is permitted every day before 9 a.m. and
after 5 p.m.
   The restrictions adopted Thursday end most water-use
restrictions in coastal areas from Palm Beach Gardens to Key West
and west to Lee County. Stricter rules remain for rain-deficient
Jupiter and Tequesta areas.
   Although the south Florida drought is now in its 23rd month,
even below-average summer rains have topped off the Biscayne
Aquifer and ended the threat of its contamination by sea water.
   Still, Lake Okeechobee, the region's backup water supply, stands
at almost 2{ feet below normal.

   Fox Broadcasting Co. said it will start its
fall season early with two programming moves designed to snatch
viewers from the Big Three.
   ``Babes,'' a half-hour comedy about three overweight sisters,
will premiere at 8:30 p.m. on Aug. 23.
   That show will be preceded on Thursday nights by repeats of
``The Simpsons,'' as the latter moves early into its new time slot
against NBC's top-rated ``The Cosby Show.''
   Original episodes featuring the animated Simpsons family will
begin in late October. Fox's highly publicized decision to do
battle with Bill Cosby is the most daring aspect of the alternative
network's fall schedule.
   Thursday's announcement that ``Babes'' will debut in six weeks
came just two days after Fox executives said the pilot was being
redone because some of the program's jokes were considered too
raunchy.
   Breaking with tradition has been one of the reasons cited for
the success of the 4-year-old Fox network. For example, it has
launched its fall shows early while ABC, CBS and NBC are still
broadcasting summer repeats.

radio said, in a report monitored in Bangkok.
   ``The two sides frankly exchanged ideas on the issue.'' it said.
It gave no additional information on the Vietnamese proposal for
joint searches.
   Vietnam has said that since April the United States has twice
suspended meetings between MIA specialists from the two countries.
   At the beginning of this month, Richard Solomon, U.S. assistant
secretary of state for east Asian affairs, complained of ``a
relative lack of serious cooperation over the past several months''
on the MIA issue.
   Washington lists about 2,300 Americans missing from the
Indochina war; about 1,700 of them in Vietnam, and the rest in
Laos, Cambodia and Chinese coastal waters.
   The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency last month said it had
confirmed a decade-old report that Vietnam had the remains of 400
or more U.S. servicemen stored in a warehouse.
   The radio report said that during the Hanoi meeting the
Vietnamese side rejected as ``ill-intentioned fabrications'' both
this report and another which said U.S. servicemen were still being
held in Vietnam.
   Cooperation on the MIA issue is hampered by a lack of diplomatic
ties between the United States and Vietnam.
   Hanoi has eagerly sought diplomatic relations, but Washington
has first demanded a peace settlement in Cambodia, where
U.S.-backed guerrillas are fighting the government Vietnam
installed after a 1978 invasion.

   The round-trip cost of chugging across New York
Harbor in a bright yellow Staten Island ferry is going up from a
quarter to 50 cents.
   Mayor David Dinkins signed bills Thursday making the fare hike _
along with $564 million in new taxes _ official. The fare goes up
in three weeks.
   The ferry takes riders on a seven-mile trip across the harbor,
past the Statue of Liberty, between Manhattan and the city's least
populous borough. The fare is paid in Manhattan by outgoing
passengers.
   Besides commuters, the ferry is popular with tourists.
   The last time the price went up was in 1975. Until then, the
traditional fare was a nickel, each way.

<HEAD>NAACP Seeks To Distance Itself From Charges Of `Jewish Racism'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   NAACP leaders agreed to meet with Jewish
groups angered by a statement that claimed ``Jewish racism'' had
kept blacks from being treated fairly in the entertainment industry.
   While distancing themselves from the remarks, made during a
panel session at the NAACP convention here, leaders reasserted
their view that blacks are victims of racism in Hollywood.
   ``We do not agree with the statement, but we do not exercise
thought control. I would not invite a panelist here and then say
you cannot say this or that,'' said NAACP Executive Director
Benjamin L. Hooks.
   ``We do have a position that there has been racism in Hollywood.
That's proven,'' Hooks told reporters Thursday.
   ``We don't want to separate it into Italian Americans, or Jewish
Americans or Greek Americans. They're all white folk as far as
we're concerned, and we've got to sit down and reason together as
brothers and sisters,'' Hooks said.
   The time and place for a meeting will be determined by an NAACP
committee assigned to work out the details, Hooks said.
   The organization also issued a call on Thursday, the concluding
day of its convention, to the movie and recording industry for an
agreement to bring more blacks, women and other minorities into the
entertainment field.
   Hollywood studios have been reluctant to talk about any aspect
of the issue. A telephone poll on Wednesday produced refusals to
comment from the major studios, with one executive calling it a
``no-win'' situation.
   Jewish organizations contacted Thursday said they were satisfied
with the move by the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
   Leaders said they agreed with the NAACP stance about racism in
the entertainment industry, but said it was ``negative and
misguided'' to point at Jews as its source.
   An official for the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'Rith said
any meeting with his group on the issue would only concern the
remarks of an NAACP delegate regarding Jews.
   ``We're not the right address for dealing with Hollywood,'' said
B'Nai B'Rith regional director David Lehrer. ``If they wish to
discuss the motion picture industry, they should meet with them. We
don't represent that diverse industry.''
   Marla Gibbs, a producer and star of the NBC sitcom ``227,'' said
during a Tuesday workshop session at the convention: ``I think
we're all talking about film distribution and marketing based on
how the Jewish people and the other people set it up. It was not
set up for us. So we have a problem.''

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea today denied allegations
in an Amnesty International report that said the country holds
hundreds of political prisoners and has tortured some of them.
   The Justice Ministry said in a statement that since President
Roh Tae-woo took office in 1988 no individual has been punished
simply for harboring certain political views.
   ``It is regrettable that without giving any evidence or
criteria, (Amnesty International) defined some of those in prison
as prisoners of conscience and demanded their release,'' the
statement said.
   In its annual report released Wednesday, Amnesty International
charged that South Korea holds about 900 political prisoners and
some have been tortured.
   ``In South Korea, there are no prisoners of conscience as
referred to by the International Amnesty report. Those who remain
in prison have either violated laws or endangered the very safety
of our nation,'' the statement said.
   It said that many of those defined as ``prisoners of
conscience'' by the London-based human rights monitoring group are
spies sent by North Korea. It said the Communist nation poses a
serious threat to South Korea's security.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of the
Korean peninsula in 1945.
   Addressing the issue of torture, the statement said two suspects
died last year in police custody but that they were isolated cases.
Two policemen involved in torturing the prisoners were arrested and
put on trial, it said.
   In its annual world survey of human rights, Amnesty also said
thousands of people were imprisoned, tortured and killed last year
by governments seeking to suppress conflicts arising from ethnic
tensions or nationalist yearnings.

<HEAD>PLO Official Says His Group Approved Meeting With Defense Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAID GHAZALI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A PLO official said in an interview published
today that his organization approved in advance the first major
meeting between local Palestinians and a Cabinet minister in the
new Israeli government.
   The meeting between Defense Minister Moshe Arens and three West
Bank Palestinian mayors came after the new right-wing government
said it hoped to reach a Middle East peace settlement by talking
only to Palestinians not linked to the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Israel's refusal to give the PLO even an indirect role in peace
talks was one reason U.S. efforts to mediate a peace settlement
have stalled.
   Abdullah Hourani, a member of the PLO's executive committee,
said in an interview with the Jerusalem Arabic weekly Al-Nadwa that
the PLO knew of the meeting ahead of time and received reports on
it afterward.
   ``The PLO endorsed a meeting as a chance for Palestinian
national figures to notify the Israeli official that the PLO is the
legitimate representative ... for the Palestinian people,'' Hourani
was quoted as saying.
   Mayor Farah Araj of Beit Jala, one of those who met with Arens
on June 27, verified the account given by Hourani.
   ``The content of our talks (with Arens) that the PLO is the only
representative is also correct,'' he told The Associated Press
today.
   Mayor Elias Freij of Bethlehem, who also attended the meeting,
said Hourani ``has the right to say this'' when asked about the PLO
official's comments.
   Freij, who is regarded as among the most moderate Palestinians,
had said after the June meeting that the officials told Arens that
only the PLO could negotiate with Israel.
   The third mayor who attended, Hanna Atrash of Beit Sahour, was
not available for comment.
   After Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir formed the new right-wing
government on June 11, officials immediately reiterated the stand
that the government would not negotiate with the PLO, which Israel
considers a terrorist organization.
   Officials said later that the government's peace effort would
focus on trying to open talks with Palestinians who are not part of
the PLO, a tactic that has repeatedly failed in the past.
   ``We are going to make a determined effort to convince our
Palestinians here that the PLO option is not available,'' said
Yossi Ben-Aharon, a top policy adviser to Shamir.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said last month that any
peace talks with Israel need the acquiescence of the PLO. Without
PLO consent, Baker said, ``there won't be any dialogue for Israel.''

   The Senate gave final congressional approval
today to legislation guaranteeing a full range of civil rights for
disabled Americans. The measure now goes to President Bush, who is
expected to sign it next week.
   The Senate passed the bill 91-6 a day after the House approved
it 377-28, culminating two years of legislative efforts.
   The measure guarantees the nation's estimated 43 million
disabled people access to jobs, transportation, telephone service
and stores, restaurants, shopping malls and other public
accommodations.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the administration welcomed the final congressional passage of the
measure.
   ``We congratulate the Congress for joining us in this landmark
legislation,'' Fitzwater said. He said there would likely be a
White House signing ceremony next week.
   ``When the president proposed this legislation, he said disabled
Americans must become full partners in America's opportunity
society. We consider passage of this important civil righrts
legislation to be among the most important accomplishments of the
administration,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush earlier this year urged Congress to speed passage of the
bill, which has been called the most significant piece of civil
rights legislation since the 1964 act that guaranteed rights for
blacks and other racial minorities.
   Voting against the legislation were Sens. Christopher S. Bond,
R-Mo.; Sens. Jake Garn, R-Utah, Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., Steve Symms, R-Idaho, and Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.,
   Not voting were Sens. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.; James A.
McClure, R-Idaho, and Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo.
   The vote followed a brief debate that included a speech in sign
language by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, the chief Senate sponsor of
the bill.
   Harkin paid he silent tribute to his deaf brother. Harkin later
explained, ``I wanted to say to my brother Frank that today was my
proudest day in 16 years in Congress.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the bill ``ensures that
millions of men and women and children can look forward to the day
when they will be judged by the strength of their abilities, not
misconceptions about their disabilities.''
   ``It is a comprehensive piece of legislation that will have a
dramatic impact not only on the disabled but on the consciousness
of America as well,'' said Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., the lead
House sponsor of the bill said after the House vote.
   Hoyer added that Bush ``will be ecstatic to sign this bill with
the largest possible crowd he can invite.''
   Bush has vetoed other major domestic legislation _ minimum wage
and family medical leave. A special commission under former
President Reagan had urged a disabilities bill, however.
   A key supporter has been James S. Brady, the former White House
press secretary who suffered a disabling head injury when shot in
the 1981 assassination attempt on Reagan.
   Business, transportation systems and local governments will bear
most of the costs of the bill. Supporters say businesses will
ultimately benefit by the increased participation of disabled
people in the economy, and the federal government will pay less for
welfare and special support.
   The House on Thursday accepted a compromise provision that helps
protect the jobs of AIDS-infected workers in food industries,
including restaurants.
   Under the legislation, the Health and Human Services Department
must determine which diseases are transmitted by food handling. HHS
Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, a physician, has told lawmakers that
AIDS cannot be transmitted by handling food.
   The bill phases in its requirements and exempts businesses with
fewer than 15 employees from its hiring requirements. Small
businesses would have more time than larger ones to make their
premises accessible to disabled customers, but no change would be
required that would cause a financial hardship to companies.
   Transportation requirements, including making all new buses
accessible to people with wheelchairs, would occur over years.
Amtrak and commuter rail lines will be covered.
   The cost to supply relay services for hearing- and
speech-impaired telephone users would be spread out among all
telephone users, adding little to average phone bills, supporters
said.
   The bill does not list disabilities that are covered, saying
rather that anyone is disabled who has a mental or physical
impairment that limits a person ``in some major life function.'' It
also includes anyone perceived as being disabled, such as someone
with a disfiguring scar.
   The bill specifically excludes, however, active drug users and
people with mental disorders such as pyromania or kleptomania that
could lead to criminal behavior. Although the bill protects people
who suffer from AIDS _ large numbers of them homosexuals _ it does
not protect homosexuals per se.
   Still, critics of the bill say the language is so vague that
only lawyers can understand it. The bill will create ``a firestorm
of litigation,'' said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who voted against it.
   Businesses that repeatedly violate the public accommodations
provisions could be fined $50,000 for the first finding of
violation and $100,000 for the second. The Justice Department could
also seek compensation, but not punitive damages, for victims of
discrimination.
   Sanctions for violating the employment provision are tied to the
1964 Civil Rights Act, meaning a person who is discriminated
against may seek a court order, back pay and lawyer's fees.

<TEXT>
   Former White House aide Oliver L. North
testified for the sixth time today before the special federal grand
jury that is continuing to investigate the Iran-Contra affair.
   The retired Marine lieutenant colonel, who is appealing his
three Iran-Contra convictions, has been questioned before the panel
by prosecutors working for independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.
   North coordinated a secret operation to ship arms to the
Nicaraguan Contras after Congress banned U.S. military aid when he
served as a National Security Council aide in the Reagan
administration.
   The panel has also heard testimony from North's old boss, former
national security adviser John M. Poindexter, who was convicted of
lying to Congress about the Iran-Contra affair. Poindexter, who
received a six-month prison term but is free pending appeal of the
convictions, is expected to give additional grand jury testimony.
   The grand jury is trying to determine if other Reagan
administration officials participated in efforts to deceive
Congress about the sale of U.S. arms to Iran and the diversion of
weapons-deal profits to the Contras, sources say.
   It also is trying to perform a final assessment of the roles of
then-President Reagan and then-Vice President Bush in the
Iran-Contra affair.

   Firefighters today battled a blaze in a
subway utility tunnel under construction that forced authorities to
close downtown streets and a heavily-used freeway through the
morning rush hour.
   About 140 city firefighters were battling flames in the 700-foot
utility tunnel, said city fire spokesman Pat Marek. The cause of
the fire, reported at 1:50 a.m., was not immediately known.
   Intense heat, smoke and toxic fumes from burning plastic
prevented firefighters from entering the tunnel, Fire Chief Lon
Pursell said. Fire crews decided to let the blaze burn itself out,
he said.
   The fumes posed no immediate threat to the public, Pursell said.
   The fire struck a utility tunnel for the Metro Rail rapid
transit line that is under construction.
   Two firefighters suffered minor injuries, Marek said. The fire
was contained to the tunnel and no other structures were
threatened, he said.

   Thousands of exhausted, grimy Albanians
reached this Adriatic port today on board a flotilla of ferries
that evacuated about 4,500 asylum-seekers from embassies in the
hard-line Communist state.
   The first ship, the Espresso Grecia, arrived this morning after
a journey of about seven hours. As it docked, a Red Cross nun in a
starched white uniform dashed off clutching a newborn baby in an
orange blanket.
   ``I feel so many emotions, so much liberty,'' said a beaming
young woman as she disembarked. Police whisked her away before she
could give her name.
   Albanians lining the decks of three more ships broke into chants
of ``Italia! Italia!'' and ``We shall win!'' as they arrived this
afternoon.
   Five ships chartered by West Germany, Italy and France cruised
to Albania on Thursday to pick up thousands of refugees who have
packed Western embassies in the capital, Tirana, in the last two
weeks.
   The ship chartered by the French, the Orient Star, was cruising
directly to Marseille, French officials said.
   The evacuation was expected to defuse one of the worst crises
facing Albania's hard-line Communist government in decades.
   Many of the Albanians leaving the ships in Brindisi looked
stunned. One man crossed himself as he got off the Appia. On the
Espresso Grecia, a man swung a baby in a white sweater up and down
in glee.
   Many of the Albanians boarded trains for West Germany after a
quick breakfast of hot milk and croissants provided by the local
government.
   ``Everyone off to freedom!'' a refugee cried to his cheering
countrymen waving from the windows of a departing train.
   The arrivals, many of them single men or young families, were
sweaty and their clothes were grimy after crowding together for two
weeks or more in the small embassies.
   ``We are all feeling glad,'' said a mining engineer named
Muharrem, clutching a foil-wrapped packet of Italian army-issue
crackers. ``We are going in the West toward freedom. All the world
is going West,'' he said, grinning.
   ``We want freedom,'' said Arjan Xhaferi, 32, carrying his
5-year-old daughter, Arrisa, on his shoulders. ``I have sacrificed
everything _ even my life.''
   He said he and his family entered the West German Embassy in
Tirana by scaling the wall in the middle of the night.
   A few people were carried off the ferry on stretchers with foot
injuries apparently suffered when they entered the embassies.
Albanian police fired at some of the asylum-seekers.
   The five ships were bringing out about 3,200 people who had
crowded into the West German Embassy, more than 800 from the
Italian Embassy and about 540 from the French Embassy.
   The Albanians were transported by bus from the embassies 20
miles west to the port of Durres, where they boarded the ferries,
they said. Police ringed the dock to prevent anyone else from
jumping aboard, crew members said.
   Durres is about 85 miles from Brindisi.
   The Albanians from the Italian Embassy will be transferred to a
temporary shelter outside the town. West Germany sent three trains
to the dock to pick up the Albanians. Authorities would not
disclose their destination.
   Until today, only 51 of the 5,000 or more asylum-seekers had
left Albania. The small group was permitted to leave the
Czechoslovak Embassy and take a plane to Prague on Tuesday.
   Hungary's official news agency reported that 40 Albanians who
sought refuge in the Hungarian mission in Tirana would be put
aboard a special flight tonight for Budapest.
   The assault on the embassies and several accompanying
demonstrations presented the biggest challenge in decades to the
Albanian government.
   The situation was reminiscent of a rush on foreign embassies in
East Germany last year, which contributed to the collapse of that
country's Communist system.
   The Albanian government of Communist leader Ramiz Alia agreed to
let the refugees leave the embassy compounds after supplies of food
and medicine ran low and hygienic conditions deteriorated.
   The West German Foreign Ministry in Bonn said its embassy in
Tirana had been closed for renovations.
   ``The embassy is in an inconceivable state,'' said spokesman
Juergen Chrobog. He said renovations would ``last a long time,''
and he did not know when the embassy would officially reopen.
   Foreign Ministry officials have said the resolution worked out
for the Albanians who left today included an agreement that seeking
refuge in embassies could not become an accepted route for
emigration.
   Alia introduced limited reforms this year, including some
religious freedom and travel abroad, which Albanians have not been
able to do for 45 years.
   The crisis in Albania has caused a shake-up in the leadership,
but the government has vowed to maintain its Communist line.

   Mental health advocates are hailing a new drug
for acute schizophrenia but criticizing its pricetag _ $750 per
month per patient.
   Groups attending a weeklong convention on psychiatric treatment
want Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. to provide more information on
clozapine's cost. They also urged state hospitals to buy more.
   The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill has adopted the same
position.
   ``We're hearing what sound like testimonials at church revivals
on the effects of the drug,'' said J. Benedict Centifanti, deputy
director of Pennsylvania Protection and Advocacy Inc., a support
group for psychiatric patients.
   Clozapine reduces emotional disturbances and thought disorders
in schizophrenics who haven't responded to conventional treatment,
said Sandoz, which introduced it in February.
   ``In some cases recovery is quite dramatic,'' said Barbara
Gordon, research director for the state Office of Mental Health.
``In others it's not so dramatic, but even they are showing
improvement.''
   Unlike other drugs prescribed for schizophrenia, such as
thorazine and prolixin, clozapine doesn't cause involuntary facial
tremors known as tardive dyskinesia, an irreversible condition in
some cases.
   ``When you take one of those drugs you are rolling the dice,''
said Dr. Janice Guidotti, who held a workshop Thursday at Duquesne
University.
   The workshop was part of a five-day convention attended by 1,000
current and former mental patients and their advocates, whose goals
include getting rid of a perceived stigma associated with
psychiatric treatment and advancing a nationwide civil rights
movement for mental patients.
   Sandoz Pharmaceuticals of East Hanover, N.J., said part of the
reason for clozapine's high cost is the need for patients to
undergo weekly blood tests to check for a potentially deadly side
effect _ a reduction in white blood cell count.
   The company estimates 5,000 patients in public and private
hospitals in the United States take clozapine. Sandoz
Pharmaceuticals estimated up to 2 percent of patients taking the
drug could develop the side effect.
   The price of the drug should drop when more psychiatrists
prescribe it, said Dr. Gilbert Honigfeld, a Sandoz spokesman.
   At a workshop Thursday, Centifanti cited the case of James
Angliss, a patient at Western State Hospital in Steilacoom, Wash.,
who sued for the right to take clozapine. Administrators withheld
it because of cost and potential liability.
   The case is believed to be the first in the United States
involving clozapine, Centifanti said.
   A jury awarded Angliss $600,000 and his mother $60,000 after he
was forced to take another drug and developed tardive dyskinesia.
The hospital has appealed the case.
   Pennsylvania will spend $2 million this fiscal year to treat
schizophrenics with clozapine in state hospitals, enough for about
220 patients. Gordon said there are 4,500 schizophrenics among
7,000 state hospital patients.

<TEXT>
   President Bush met today with President-elect
Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and praised his ``forthright commitment''
to cooperate with the United States in fighting drug traffic and on
other issues.
   Welcoming Gaviria to the Oval Office, Bush said that in their
talks, ``respect is the word here today and friendship.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the two
leaders would discuss the war on drugs and the administration's
$80.5 million aid request this year to assist Colombia's drug
interdiction efforts.
   Trade issues, including Colombia's complaints about U.S. trade
restrictions on some Colombian exports, were also likely to come
up, he said.
   Appearing earlier on the NBC ``Today'' show, Gaviria said the
United States ``has not found many ways to help Colombia in this
time.'' He said he is looking for help in the areas of trade and
commercial assistance.
   ``Right now we are losing so much in lives and we are incurring
so much cost economically and politically,'' Gaviria said. He added
that ``if we do not curb the demand for drugs, we are going to have
a lot of violence in Colombia and I think that's the engine of the
problem.''
   Gaviria was elected May 27 when millions of Colombians went to
the polls in defiance of terrorist threats following the bloodiest
campaign in the South American nation's history.
   Gaviria became the Liberal Party candidate after Luis Carlos
Galan's assassination by drug traffickers on Aug. 18.
   Gaviria succeeds outgoing President Virgilio Barco, who could
not by law succeed himself. Gaviria at 43 will be the youngest man
ever to lead Colombia.
   Gaviria has vowed to continue Barco's fight against drug
traffickers. He also called on developed countries to cut cocaine
consumption.
   The major campaign issue was whether to continue the
government's tough crackdown on drug traffickers and its policy of
extraditing top dealers to the United States for prosecution.
   Gaviria, an economist, took the toughest position on the drug
traffickers and pledged to continue the U.S.-backed crackdown.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela suggested today that
Western nations have no right to pressure African countries to
accept democratic reforms.
   The 71-year-old African National Congress deputy president was
speaking in Kenya, where four days of violent clashes between
stone-throwing mobs and heavily armed riot police left at least 20
people dead. The rioting began Saturday when the government tried
to stop a pro-democracy rally.
   Mandela made no mention of the riots in his address to 20,000
people at a sports stadium in the outskirts of Nairobi.
   But he did praised Kenyans who fought for independence from
Britain in the 1950s and said: ``What right has the West, what
right have the whites anywhere, to teach us about democracy when
they executed those who asked for democracy during the time of the
colonial era?''
   Kenya has accused the United States of fueling the pro-democracy
movement and interfering in Kenyan internal affairs.
   Also today, a Kenyan human rights lawyer who fled his country
this week said in London that he fears the government of President
Daniel arap Moi will resort to massive violence to quash the
pro-democracy movement.
   Gibson Kamau Kuria flew into London on Thursday morning after
taking refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi for four days.
   Also today, The Standard newspaper reported that police detained
six more people in continuing arrests following the riots. The
newspaper's acting editor-in-chief, Mitch Odero, went into hiding
Thursday to avoid seizure.
   The reported arrests would bring to 17 the number of people
picked up since July 4, when the leading advocates for multiparty
democracy were seized.
   Mandela also made no mention of an open letter to him Thursday
by the wives of seven prominent Kenyans who are in detention or
went into hiding to avoid arrest for their criticism of Kenya's
one-party government. They had asked Mandela to intervene on their
behalf in securing their husband's freedom.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, however, said in her brief remarks that:
``I speak on behalf of those (women) who waited.''
   Nelson Mandela was freed in February after spending 27 years in
prison for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-minority
South African government.
   Mandela noted Kenya's assistance to the ANC, and he singled out
Kenya's 1978 public collection of about $181,000, which Moi later
handed over to ANC President Oliver Tambo.
   Mandela said the ANC still needed ``material and political
assistance'' from the international community and Africa in
particular.
   ``We go home determined to fight harder than ever before because
we smell victory,'' Mandela said, who is concluding a worldwide
tour in which he called on the West to maintain economic sanctions
on South Africa.
   The ANC is the largest group seeking the abolition of South
Africa's policy of racial discrimination.
   Mandela is scheduled to leave Kenya on Saturday for Mozambique
before heading back to South Africa in time for his 72nd birthday
on July 18.

   The Bush administration will ``do everything a
government can do'' to learn the fate of American servicemen
missing in action, Vice President Dan Quayle said today. But he
said more cooperation is needed from Vietnam.
   Quayle spoke to the 3,650-member National League of Familes of
American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, which is holding
its 21st annual meeting in Washington this weekend.
   ``The fullest possible accounting will continue to be a matter
of highest national priority until we achieve success,'' Quayle
told the group. ``We will do everything a government can do to
recover your loved ones. And, if we discover proof of captivitiy,
action will be taken to bring our men home.''
   However, he said, increased activities on the POW@MIA issue
``can be fully productive only if Vietnam makes the political
decision truly to cooperate with us.''
   ``Vietnam can provide the information, historical records and
cooperation necessary to resolve the contradictions and unanswered
questions which still exist,'' the vice president said.
   ``Why they don't recognize that doing so is in their own best
interest remains a mystery. I again appeal to the government of
Vietnam to make the fundamental decisions necessary to resolve this
issue.''
   Quayle ended his speech on what he called ``a personal note''
referring to a controversy that arose during the 1988 presidential
campaign. Critics said he avoided campaign duty during the Vietnam
War by joining the Indiana National Guard.
   ``I did not serve in Vietnam,'' he said. ``And while I have not
apologized, and never will, for my National Guard service, I
recognize that the members of my generation who served in Vietnam
made a sacrifice for their country that was far, far greater than
mine.''
   Another group, the newly formed National Alliance of Families
for the Return of American Servicemen, was holding a forum later in
the day on its believe that as many as 5,000 prisoners of war from
the Korean war may have remained behind in Chinese and Soviet labor
camps and some could still be alive.
   On the group's agenda was a report on the case of Bill Sowles of
Edmonds, Wash., who believes one of the men shown in a film
recovered from North Korea 37 years ago may be his father, who
vanished on a Korean battlefield in 1951.
   Their claims are rejected by the Defense Department, the State
Department and the National League of Families.
   ``To the best of our knowledge there is no verifiable evidence
that has surfaced to support these claims,'' State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher says. ``We don't believe that there are
U.S. POWs in the Soviet Union.''
   Lt. Cmdr. Ned Lundquist, a Defense Department spokesman, said
the department has documents in its files about such allegations
but ``there is no evidence today that leads us to conclude that any
of those reports were true.''
   The league's public relations director, Betsy Cox, said, ``There
is absolutely no intelligence to back up such assertions.''
   Sowles, 47, was attending an American Legion meeting in
Bellingham, Wash., when he saw a film recovered from the North
Koreans by U.S. intelligence agents in 1953, and unearthed more
recently by a Seattle television station. It purportedly showed a
group of prisoners with their communist captors. One frowning
figure caught Sowles' eye.
   ``My first thought was, `Gee, that fellow looks like my son.'
And then it just hit me that that was my dad,'' Sowles said. He
said his son, Lewis William Sowles IV, 24, ``is the spitting image
of his grandfather.''
   Sowles said Dr. Michael Charney of Colorado State University, an
expert on identifying Vietnam area remains, studied the film and
told him the man in the picture is his father.
   Willy Sowles, then 32, a medic who had also served in World War
II, disappeared when Communist Chinese Army forces overwhelmed the
U.S. 2nd Infantry Division in 1951 at the Battle of Kunu-Ri in what
is now North Korea. He was never seen again and became one of the
8,000 Americans listed as missing in action as a result of the
1950-1953 conflict.
   The reporter who unearthed the film, Mark Sauter of KIRO-TV in
Seattle, has said that declassified U.S. military intelligence
reports show that U.S. officials were told by French intelligence
in 1951 that 3,000 American prisoners had been shipped to the
Manchurian border with Korea. He said CIA reports in 1951
established the location of secret POW camps in China.
   Col. Delk Simpson, a retired Air Force officer who lives in Palm
Beach, Fla., said that when he was U.S. military attache in Hong
Kong in 1954, a refugee gave him a detailed account of American
prisoners being transferred from a Chinese to a Soviet train at the
Chinese-Siberian border town of Manchouli.
   Facing skepticism about their stories, alliance members are
seeking public disclosure of information in government files
concerning POW-MIA personnel from World War II, the Korean War or
Vietnam. The bill they support would exempt information that would
compromise national security by disclosing sources and methods of
intelligence.
   The League of Families opposes this legislation, saying it could
jeopardize Americans who might still be held. Noel Woolsley,
legislative director of AMVETS, said that organization also is
expected to oppose the bill at its convention next month.

<HEAD>Immigrants Charge Ethiopian Government Holding Jews Ransom</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ethiopian leader Mengistu Mariam Haile is
denying 10,000 Jews permission to emigrate to Israel as a way to
get military supplies from the Jewish state, a leader of the
Ethiopian community here said today.
   The accusation comes amid reports that Mengistu's hard-line
Marxist government is teetering as secessionist rebels gain ground
in their battle to topple him.
   An Israeli government spokesman said the claim was untrue.
   Rahamim Elazar, chairman of the Public Council for Ethiopian
Affairs in Israel, said Mengistu was demanding arms from Israel in
exchange for allowing more Jews to leave his country for Israel.
   ``Mengistu is trying to use them for military aid,'' he said.
   Israel has sought to bring out all of Ethiopia's Jews since
immigration was cut off in 1984 when a secret airlift campaign
known as Operation Moses was halted after the Ethiopian government
learned of it.
   About 8,000 Ethiopian Jews were brought to Israel in the
U.S.-supported, three-month operation. About 15,000 Jews are
believed to remain in the North African country.
   Elazar told The Associated Press that 10,000 Ethiopian Jews were
encamped in Addis Ababa after leaving villages in the province of
Gondar in hope of eventually emigrating to Israel.
   The Jews went to the Ethiopian capital after Israel and
Mengistu's government resumed diplomatic relations in October,
Elazar said. He said his information came from Jews who managed to
leave Ethiopia.
   On Wednesday, the chairman of the U.S. House Subcommittee on
African Affairs charged that Mengistu was trying to pressure Israel
into supplying Ethiopia with 1,000 cluster bombs.
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, a Michigan Democrat, was quoted by the
newspaper Washington Jewish Week as warning Mengistu not to use
Ethiopian Jews to pressure Israel.
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, denied that Mengistu asked Israel to supply him with
weapons. He also denied that Ethiopia was placing obstacles in the
way of Jews wanting to leave.
   ``The situation there is so complicated, there is a war there,
confusion, famine,'' said Pazner. ``This is the reason they are
being held up.''
   An Italian newspaper reported Saturday that Mengistu made a
secret visit to Israel on July 3 to meet Israeli leaders. Israeli
officials denied the report.
   In January, The New York Times quoted unidentified U.S.
officials as saying they strongly suspected Israel had supplied
Ethiopia with cluster bombs for it war against the rebels. Other
reports said Israel also supplied Mengistu with military advisers,
ammunition and spare parts.
   Israel has denied it supplied cluster bombs to Ethiopia. It has
refused to confirm or deny reports of other supposed arms sales
under its standing policy of not discussing any weapons deals.
   A recent article in the independent Hebrew daily Haaretz written
by Zeev Schiff, a respected military analyst, said U.S. officials
were trying to damage Israel's image by fabricating the reports of
cluster bomb sales.
   The United States has criticized Israeli support for Ethiopia.
The U.S. government objects to sale of cluster bombs without
Washington's permission since the weapons were developed with U.S.
technology.

   ``Cheers'' co-star Kelsey Grammer was ordered
to stand trial on a cocaine possession charge after failing to
enter a drug treatment program.
   Grammer, 35, made no comment Thursday as Van Nuys Superior Court
Judge James Coleman rejected a defense request to give the actor
another chance to complete the drug program, said Deputy District
Attorney Teri Hutchison. The drug charge could have been dropped
after the program.
   Grammer plays the egocentric, patrician Dr. Frasier Crane in the
hit NBC comedy series.
   He is accused of possessing about a quarter-gram of cocaine
which police said they found in the back seat of a patrol car after
bringing the actor in on a warrant for an outstanding speeding
ticket.
   Grammer was pulled over April 14, 1988, because his license
plate registration tags were expired.
   The cocaine charge carries a maximum sentence of three years.
   Grammer, who lives in Van Nuys, has a previous misdemeanor
conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol, Ms.
Hutchison said.

<HEAD>NASA Officials Said Hubble Flaw Clearly Avoidable By Simple Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA officials said today the flaw that gives
the Hubble Space Telescope a fuzzy view of the universe could have
been detected in simple, low-cost tests that were not performed
before launch.
   Lennard Fisk, the chief scientist for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, said the perscription error in the two
main mirrors of the $1.5 billion Hubble is so precise that it had
to have happened during manufacturing.
   It is an error, he said, that could have been detected and
corrected while the mirrors were being made or after they were
assembled into a telescope.
   ``The error is very large, therefore some simple, low-cost,
no-risk test that could have been done could have detected the
flaw,'' Fisk said in testimony before the House committee on
science, space and technology.
   Asked why the test was not performed if it was so low-cost and
simple, Fisk said, ``We're asking those same questions.''
   NASA officials had said in earlier statements that tests to
detect the focusing flaw that has disabled Hubble would have
required up to $300 million and the construction of a special
facility.
   But Fisk said today that may not have been the case. He said
such a facility would have been required for a test of the fully
assembled telescope, but that there could have been other, cheaper
tests performed that were not done.
   ``You could have performed tests on the mirrors individually
that could have detected this flaw,'' he said.
   Failure to conduct such tests, said Fisk, ``was a technical
decision and not a financial decision.''
   Hubble was built in the early 1980s and was launched on April 25
of this year. It was only after it had been in orbit for more than
two months that engineers discovered there was a flaw in either the
94-inch primary mirror or the 12-inch secondary mirror that collect
and concentrate starlight.
   The lack of focus has cut the possible research by the telescope
by about half, according to most estimates.
   Fisk said the focus problem will be corrected for the main
Hubble camera in 1993 when a replacement camera is flown up to the
telescope by the space shuttle and spacewalking astronauts switch
out instruments. But that mission will correct the focus for only
one of the five instruments on board Hubble. Other corrections will
have to wait until 1996 and later.
   Hubble is designed to operate for 15 years, and Fisk said that
with the replacement instruments the telescope will recoup work
lost by the focusing error.
   ``Hubble is not a dud,'' he said. ``Hubble will be capable over
its 15-year lifetime to accomplish all the science'' that is
expected.
   Richard Truly, administrator of NASA, said that an investigation
committee is now studying records on Hubble and eventually will
determine where the mistake was made that allowed a flawed
telescope to be launched.

<HEAD>Concert Promoters Threaten To Cancel Convention if Labeling
Becomes Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group that promotes concerts threatened
today to cancel its New Orleans convention this fall if the
governor approves a bill that requires labels for explicit records.
   It was the latest complaint about the bill, passed by the
Legislature and sent to the Gov. Buddy Roemer for either his
signature or his veto.
   Under the bill, which would be the first state law of its type,
records with lyrics some consider obscene would be labeled and kept
from minors.
   Carl Freed, director of the North American Concert Promoters
Association, said in a statement from New York: ``If this bill
becomes law, concert promoters, recording artists and community
retailers will be driven out of business. They are being made
scapegoats by soap box politicians.''
   Freed said the association would cancel its convention,
scheduled for Oct. 5, if record labeling becomes a law.
   On Thursday, members of the music industry in Louisiana
suggested a program of voluntary labeling to head off the
governor's signature of the mandatory labeling bill.
   ``Our plan is to have every record dealer in the state
voluntarily sign a pledge that they will not sell records with
explicit lyrics to minors,'' said Shea Dixon, backer of a proposed
Grammy Hall Of Fame for New Orleans. ``That's pretty much what's
being done now. This just formalizes it.''
   The Record Industry Association of America labeling system,
which took effect July 1, effectively singles out explicit records,
said Freddie Szilagi, manager of Tower Records in New Orleans.
   According to the pledge to be sent to the governor, record
dealers agree not to sell any recording to any minor that either
bears the RIAA warning or any other manufacturer-imposed warning,
or one that they find should be so labeled.
   Roemer has until July 29 to decide the fate of the record
labeling bill. If he does not sign it or veto it, the bill
automatically becomes law.

<TEXT>
   Mohawk Indians have opened talks with the
Quebec government after a police officer died in a gunfight over
plans for a golf course addition on land the tribe claims.
   But the Mohawks in this town near Montreal swore to keep their
barricades up until police leave and they get immunity from
prosecution.
   Quebec's native affairs minister, John Ciaccia, said the two
sides held talks late Thursday and agreed to more talks today.
   ``We've had a very positive meeting,'' Ciacca said. He said
Thursday's talks were halted to ``respect the Mohawk tradition of
not continuing this type of a meeting after sunset.''
   The dispute centers on plans by the Oka town government to build
a golf course addition the Indians say encroaches on their
ancestral land.
   Police brought in reinforcements Thursday, bringing to about
1,000 the number of officers in the area.
   The Mohawks dug trenches and strengthened their concrete-block
and barbed-wire barriers with crushed police cars as they prepared
for a possible showdown.
   Dozens of police wearing flak jackets and carrying shotguns were
seen patrolling their new sandbagged positions reinforced with
concrete blocks.
   All day Thursday, the two sides faced each other across their
barricades, about 200 Mohawks at the top of a hill on the highway
that goes through this picturesque town, 18 miles west of Montreal,
and the police at the bottom of the hill.
   ``The police have to retreat completely from the area before we
can ever work out a deal with Ciaccia,'' Mohawk spokeswoman Ellen
Gabriel said.
   A Ciaccia aide said earlier the minister was negotiating with
members of the Mohawk band council and their Warriors Society,
trying to resolve the dispute.
   Mohawks, wearing camouflage and carrying revolvers, hunting
rifles and assault rifles, raised the yellow and red Warrior
Society flag over the golf course's immaculate lawns. They
commandeered a fleet of golf carts to ferry leaders and messages
between encampments.
   The Mohawks claim title to a small pine forest Oka wants to cut
down so the golf course can add nine holes. Police intervened at
the request of Oka's mayor after Mohawks refused to tear down a
small barricade they built four months ago.
   Early Wednesday, a raiding force of about 100 Quebec police
attacked the barricade. They retreated after Cpl. Marcel Lemay, 31,
was shot. Police said they were not certain whether he was shot by
Mohawks or fellow police.
   According to a newspaper report today, ballistics tests
indicated the bullet was not from Lemay's weapon or from the weapon
used by his colleagues.
   Le Journal de Montreal also said the bullet that killed him
pierced his lungs and heart and was found under his right shoulder
blade. It said Lemay was wearing a bullet proof vest but the bullet
slipped through a small opening under his right arm.
   Initial reports said he was shot in the face.
   Montreal police declined to comment on the report. Angele Joyal,
a police spokesman, said there would be no comment until the
investigation was completed. He also declined to say when the
autopsy report would be ready.
   Jocelyn Turcotte, president of the Quebec provincial police
association, came to the lines to talk to his union members.
   ``We don't want to send our members back in to assault this
barricade again, because the Mohawks are heavily armed and it would
not be a safe action at this time,'' he said. ``One policeman has
already been killed and we don't want another death.''

<TEXT>
   Bart Simpson, the television cartoon
character whose image can be found on everything from coffee mugs
to T-shirts, is now turning up on stamps of the psychedelic drug
LSD.
   Bart's smirking face has appeared on blotter acid, LSD-laced
stamps that are sold in sheets, police said.
   Michael Borcsok, 21, of Albany, was charged Tuesday with
possession of 261 ``hits'' of hallucinogenic Bart Simpson stamps,
police said.
   Another batch of the stamps surfaced last week in Pittsfield,
Mass., about 40 miles east of Albany, police there said.
   ``These stamps are very obviously aimed at young children. Kids
love Bart Simpson,'' said Steve Dnistrian, a spokesman for Phoenix
House, a New York drug rehabilitation center.
   Cartoon characters such as Mickey Mouse and Goofy have been
placed on blotter acid sheets since the 1960s, when the illegal
drug became widely sold.

   NASA partly filled Atlantis'
external tank with liquid hydrogen today in an attempt to locate a
leak that has grounded the spacecraft and has all shuttle missions
on hold.
   A leak reoccurred during the testing around a valve in a pipe
that carries fuel from the external tank to the main engines.
Engineers planned to spend the rest of the day analyzing the data
and try to pinpoint the source of the leak.
   ``There's no speculation on exactly how much was leaking or
exactly where the leak was coming from, whether it was the orbiter
side or the tank side,'' said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
   During the testing, super-cold volatile fuel was pumped into the
tank. A small amount of hydrogen escaped into a bag around a
17-inch-diameter valve. When the flow was increase, more hydrogen
leaked in the valve area.
   Extra sensors had been placed next to valves, pipes and seals
suspected of leaking, with plastic bags covering the components.
The contents of the bags will be analyzed in an attempt to pinpoint
the leak.
   ``We're going to a lot of trouble to add numerous points of data
collection,'' said David Winterhalter, director of systems
engineering and analysis for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   A less vigorous test was conducted June 29, during which
hydrogen escaped from Atlantis' extensive plumbing system. The
shuttle's classified Defense Department flight in mid-July
consequently was put on hold.
   In late May, a hydrogen leak was detected in Columbia while the
shuttle was being fueled for an astronomy mission. Columbia was
returned to the hangar for repairs. Atlantis remains at the launch
pad.
   The leaks have prompted NASA to ground the three-shuttle fleet.
It was the first time the fleet has been grounded since shuttle
Challenger exploded in January 1986, killing seven crew members. No
shuttle flew for two-and-a-half years after that.
   Rockwell International, the shuttle builder, has identified
Columbia's leak in laboratory tests in California but has not yet
found the source in the group of pipes and valves linking the
orbiter with the external tank.
   The space agency encountered more trouble with leaks Wednesday
when hydrogen escaped from an unmanned Atas-Centaur rocket during a
simulated countdown. The problem quickly was fixed and was
considered so minor it would not have delayed Tuesday's launch with
a NASA scientific satellite, said agency spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
   That launch was postponed one to two weeks, however, after
problems were discovered Thursday with one of the satellite's two
``black boxes.'' The so-called command decoder units receive ground
commands and plug them into the spacecraft's system.
   ``All they know at this point is it's not returning any
information or indicating it's even receiving any information,''
Buckingham said. ``It's just kind of staring back at us.''
   The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite, or CRRES,
will study the invisible magnetic and electric fields in space and
measure space radiation and its effects on microelectronics. It is
a joint program of NASA and the Defense Department.

   The Senate Armed Services Committee early
today approved a $289 billion defense bill that cuts troop strength
in Europe by 50,000 and reduces the budget request for the
Strategic Defense Initiative by nearly $1 billion.
   In a session that began early Thursday and ended shortly after 1
a.m. today, the panel agreed to an overall budget that is $18
billion less than President Bush proposed in January.
   The committee, as expected, agreed to the total its chairman,
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., had called for in military spending.
   ``This is a responsible and manageable glide-path toward a major
restructuring of the military establishment and the way it does
business,'' Nunn told reporters at a news conference announcing
completion of the bill.
   The full Senate is expected to take up the bill just prior to
the August recess, and Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking
Republican on panel, predicted fights over the level of spending
for SDI and an Air Force satellite.
   ``We've postponed the battle to the floor,'' Warner said of the
SDI issue.
   In a surprise move, the panel adopted a measure that reduces
armed forces in Europe, an issue left unresolved by U.S. and Soviet
negotiators after stalled talks on cutting conventional forces.
   The panel agreed to a total 100,000-person reduction in military
personnel.
   Nunn has told the committee to draw up legislation around two
numbers _ his preferred budget level of $289 billion and the Budget
Committee-approved level of $286 billion.
   Bush proposed $307 billion in defense spending for fiscal 1991,
but it has been assumed that Congress would cut the budget.
   As expected, the committee agreed to limit money for the two
land-based nuclear missiles _ the MX and Midgetman _ to only
research and development funds.
   The administration requested more than $2.2 billion for the two
missiles but the committee earmarked $548 million for the MX and
$202 million for the Midgetman, said the sources, who requested
anonymity.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney also proposed canceling the V-22
Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopter
and flies like a plane. But the Armed Services panel agreed to more
than $200 million in research and development funds for the
aircraft.
   In a politically divisive issue, the panel agreed to eliminate
about $1 billion for the Milstar program, an Air Force navigation
and communications satellite. The vote in the full committee was
11-9 along party lines, the sources said.
   The committee significantly reduced funds for the C-17 transport
plane and the Navy's A-12 attack plane, an aircraft that has been
at the center of controversy ever since the service said it was a
year behind schedule.
   The decision to cut the C-17 program came despite Cheney's
revised proposal for the aircraft that called for cutting the
purchase from 210 to 120. The defense secretary made that
announcement in April.
   The reduction in SDI to about $3.7 billion cuts the program's
budget to about the level Congress approved last year for the
anti-missile shield.
   The 1990 reduction marked the first time since former President
Reagan presented the plan seven years ago that the requested
funding had been cut.
   The Armed Services panel also approved a plan that eliminates
advanced procurement money for the Trident submarine, a decision
that largely limits the program to 18 submarines.
   Cheney, faced with a diminishing Soviet threat and budget
constraints, revised his request for the B-2 bomber to two planes
in fiscal 1991 and 75 planes in total.
   The panel agreed to the secretary's proposal.

   A big burst in department store sales last
month helped push retail sales up 0.5 percent, the first increase
since January, the government said Friday.
   ``It's a welcome sign for a beleaguered sector of the economy.
... It offers a good deal of hope that the economy will keep on
expanding,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co.
   Other analysts, however, cautioned against reading too much into
the turnaround. They noted that the June increase followed three
months of declines in retail sales _ a period of weakness unseen
since 1981.
   ``The question is whether it's a one-time reversal of a string
of weakness or the start of something new,'' Sinai said.
   Retail sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $147.82 billion last
month, up $784 million from the May sales level, the Commerce
Department said.
   Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total
economic activity, prolonged weakness in this area raises fears
that the economy could be headed for a downturn.
   June's upturn in retail sales was probably due, in part, to
consumers making up for lost ground in April and May, analysts said.
   Cooler temperatures in May probably resulted in Americans
holding off on buying summer clothing, air conditioning and other
seasonal items, analysts said. They probably made those purchases
in June when the weather warmed up, analysts said.
   David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill called the June increase ``just a
rebound from the softness we saw in May.''
   ``We're up only 2.4 percent from a year ago. That's not even
keeping up with inflation,'' Wyss said.
   Americans continue to demonstrate signs of cautious spending,
said Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Co. of
Chicago.
   ``The consumer did not turn tail in the spring, but nonetheless
is behaving in a rather restrained way,'' Dederick said.
   The 0.5 percent increase in June was the first rise since a big
2.8 percent jump in January. After that gain, retail sales showed
no change in February and then fell 0.4 percent in March, 1 percent
in April and 0.6 percent in May.
   Last month's increase was led by a 2.8 percent rise in spending
at department stores, reflecting a rebound after a big 2.2 percent
drop in May.
   Analysts attributed part of the dramatic increase in department
store sales, which had fallen for three months, to price cuts
intended to encourage purchases of slow-moving summer clothes.
   Auto sales edged up a tiny 0.1 percent in June after being down
0.2 percent in May. Weakness in auto sales has been a major factor
contributing to the overall sluggishness of consumer spending this
year.
   Sales at building material and hardware stores rose 1.3 percent
after falling 0.2 percent in April.
   Bucking the upward trend in June, sales at furniture and home
furnishings stores plunged 1.9 percent. They had been up a slight
0.4 percent in May.
   Sales at grocery stores were up 0.3 percent while sales at
gasoline stations climbed 0.5 percent. Sales at drug stores were up
1.2 percent but spending at bars and restaurants fell 0.6 percent.

   An extremist Islamic group today claimed
reponsibility for an explosion at a Texas chemical plant July 5
that killed 17 people.
   Arco Chemical Co. of North America said from its headquarters in
Newtown Square, Pa., that it had not heard of the claim and did not
know whether it was valid.
   The cause of the blast is under investigation, and no signs of
sabotage at the plant have been reported.
   A spokesman for the Islamic Liberation Front told The Associated
Press the Arco plant in Channelview, Texas, was attacked because
the United States supports Israel despite ``its killings and
terrorism against our Palestinian families'' in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Washington ``ignores the human rights of our Palestinian
people,'' said the official, who met with an AP reporter and spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   ``We want Washington to taste the pain of the deaths of its
people the same way we feel the pain of the killings of our
Palestinian families at the hands of the Zionist criminals,'' he
said.
   There was no way independently to verify the claim of
responsibility. The Islamic Liberation Front threatened two weeks
ago to attack U.S. and Israeli interests worldwide to avenge the
May 20 massacre of seven Palestinian laborers in a Tel Aviv suburb
by an ex-Israeli soldier.
   The Front is a relatively large group based in the West Bank and
Gaza. It has followers in Jordan and several other Arab countries.
   It advocates armed struggle against neighboring Israel and calls
for the elimination of the Jewish state.
   The Front has opposed Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman
Yasser Arafat since 1983 over his moves toward reaching a
settlement with Israel, and hundreds of guerrillas broke away from
the PLO.
   The Front was responsible for an attack on an Israeli army
patrol May 17 near the West Bank city of Hebron in which an Israeli
soldier was wounded.
   ``This factory was providing the U.S. Army with chemical
equipment, although it was publicly operating as a factory
manufacturing supplies for civilians,'' the Front's spokesman
claimed.
   ``One of our unit commanders, operating in the United States of
America, informed our headquarters in the occupied territories last
Friday that our commrades had set ablaze a Texas chemical factory
and that the mission was successfully accomplished,'' he said.
   He refused to give any further details for ``security reasons.''
   The Arco plant, 15 miles east of Houston, was wrecked by the
explosions and fire, which leveled an area the size of a city block.
   Arco spokeswoman Sallie Anderson said from the company's
headquarters today that the cause of the explosion had not been
determined. She also said she was unaware of any recent threats
against the company.
   ``We have no knowledge of any warnings,'' she said. ``There were
no warnings from that group that they were planning to blow up the
plant.''
   Asked if the company knew why it would be singled out as a
target by the group, Anderson said: ``we have no idea.''
   She said the company had no dealings with Israel and she
disputed the Front's claim that the plant was providing the U.S.
Army with chemical equipment.
   ``I think their statement from what I understand says that we
make chemical weapons for the Army and we do not,'' Ms. Anderson
said.
   Plant Manager Earl McCaleb said last week it was believed that
``some kind of work'' was being done on a device that compresses
gases before they enter tanks containing flammable hydrocarbons. He
did not elaborate.
   The plant produced propylene oxide, used to make foam for seat
cushions and bedding. The substance also is used in cleaning
compounds.
   It also produced styrene monomer, used for insulation, foam
drinking cups, packaging materials and automotive parts. Another
product was methyl tertiary butyl ether, a high octane blending
component used as a replacement for lead in gasoline.

   A woman who has camped for two years in
front of the motel where Martin Luther King Jr. died was ordered
today to get out of the way of workmen building a museum.
   Chancery Court Judge George Lewis said he would send in
sheriff's deputies at noon Saturday to move protester Jacqueline
Smith if she defied his order.
   Ms. Smith promised to stay.
   ``Right now, I don't have no intention of moving no place,'' she
said as she left Lewis' courtroom.
   Lewis denied her request to delay the hearing days while she
tried to find a lawyer to represent her. He said she has had ample
time to find a lawyer.
   Ms. Smith has been camped on a sidewalk in front of the Lorraine
Motel, where she was a former employee and resident, since March
1988. She contends the motel should be used as housing for the
homeless, not as a museum.
   King was assassinated at the Lorraine in 1968.
   The $9 million museum, called The National Civil Rights Center,
is being built by the state, county and city governments. It is to
open July 4, 1991.
   Lewis said Ms. Smith must carry on her protest somewhere other
than the museum site. She has refused requests to move to a
sidewalk across the street.
   ``The court has no alternative except to order her out of the
way of the construction,'' Lewis said.
   His order came on a petition from Jameson-Vaccaro Construction
Co. Inc., the primary contractor for the museum. Anthony Vaccaro,
project manager, said Ms. Smith is camped in a spot that must be
torn up for utility lines.

<HEAD>Former Congressman Says He's Advised Neil Bush on S&amp;L Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Rep. Thomas Ashley, a longtime friend
of President Bush, confirmed today that he's been giving advice to
Neil Bush since last winter on the controversy surrounding the
president son's role in the collapse of a Denver savings and loan.
   But Ashley, a banking lobbyist, denied that Bush had asked him
to contact his son.
   ``That is absolutely inaccurate,'' Ashley said in an interview.
``I'm to smart to do that.''
   The Denver Post reported in today's editions that Ashley, a
college classmate of George Bush's from Yale, had talked to the
younger Bush at the president's behest before Neil Bush was
questioned by federal banking regulators.
   The newspaper attributed the report to comments by Neil Bush
himself, contained in a deposition taken by the Office of Thrift
Supervision.
   ``If Neil thinks his father called me, he's mistaken,'' Ashley
said.
   Ashley, 67, a Democrat, is a former congressman from Ohio. He is
currently president of the Association of Bank Holding Companies, a
banking lobbying organization based in Washington.
   Neil Bush faces a public disciplinary hearing before federal
regulators in September on his role as a director of the bankrupt
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan.
   Ashley said that he contacted Neil Bush on his own last winter
after reading about his troubles in the paper.
   Since then, ``I've seen Neil a half dozen times. We talk about
it,'' Ashley said.
   He said that, although President Bush didn't ask him to contact
Neil Bush, the president is aware that he has been counselling the
son.
   Bush has pledged not to get personally involved in the
investigation of his son.
   Ashley said ``I don't think the president has any problem'' with
the fact that he has involved himself in the matter. ``What he
feels is I'm a longtime friend of Neil's.''
   ``Is everyone who is close to the president supposed to stay
away from Neil?'' Ashley asked.
   President Bush ``doesn't go along with that. He rejects that,''
Ashley said.
   ``I've talked to the president (about the situation) on a couple
of social occasions, when we're alone,'' including once at Camp
David, Ashley said. ``I talk about the kids. Neil's one of the
kids.''
   Ashley said that Neil has made his own decisions in the matter.
``What we do is talk about the consequences of one course or
another,'' Ashley said.
   Ashley said that his own experience in politics and in bank
regulation make him a good source for advice for Neil Bush.
   ``The situation is such that he can't go to his father and talk
to him,'' Ashley said.
   ``It's not a partisan matter or he wouldn't be coming to a
Democrat,'' Ashley added. ``It's just a situation where somebody
he's known for a long time is available and has experience in
matters involving regulatory matters.''
   ``I'm a good sounding board,'' Ashley added.
   Ashley said that Neil Bush decided on his own ``not to take the
easy way out'' and that he's been the victim of ``a little
selective treatment'' from federal regulators.
   But, Ashley said, ``He hasn't whined or complained about that.''
   He said that Neil Bush was concerned that when the Office of
Thrift Supervision ``decided to go public'' about the case, ``it
only presented its side of the matter. A thousand pages. It didn't
include Neil's defense.''
   Ashley and Bush have remained close friends since they were both
members of the secret society Skull and Bones while they were
undergraduates at Yale University in the late 1940s.

   A gang of thieves forced a train to stop in
the middle of the night in southern France, then made off with
several sacks from two mail cars, police said.
   There was no immediate word about the nature or value of the
stolen goods. No one was hurt in the robbery, which occurred
Thursday night shortly before midnight.
   A railroad official said at least one robber hid aboard the
engine in Marseille when the train was being assembled. About 60
miles out of the Mediterranean port city, the engineer was accosted
and ordered to stop the train in the countryside. At least three
accomplices were waiting to board.
   The engineer was ordered to signal on his radio that the train
had broken down, and the robbers then took several sacks of mail
and drove off in cars.
   Passengers aboard the train apparently were unaware at the time
that a theft was taking place.

<HEAD>East German Factories Agree to Preserve Jobs, Raise Wages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scores of East German factories agreed Friday
to raise wages and preserve jobs for 350,000 metalworkers but said
the labor contract may actually speed the collapse of some plants.
   The one-year pact was reached after a series of strikes by
hundreds of thousands of metalworkers around Berlin. It is the
biggest labor agreement since East Germany became a free market on
July 1.
   The contract at least temporarily ends one of many
confrontations between former government enterprises facing new
Western competition and workers demanding better pay to cope with
suddenly higher food prices.
   But while one labor dispute was settled, another arose almost
immediately. About 60,000 retail industry workers held
demonstrations in a half-dozen cities Friday to protest plans to
dissolve the government-run retail chains.
   East Germany, meanwhile, said it is facing a huge drop in income
because of declining production and would need more money from West
Germany.
   Finance Minister Walter Romberg told Parliament that East
Germany would have nearly $38.7 billion in expenditures through the
second half of this year but only $17.5 billion in income.
   East Germany merged its economy with West Germany's on July 1 in
a prelude to the full unification expected later this year.
   It is now in the early stages of converting its moribund,
centrally planned economy to a market economy. Prices have risen
dramatically, and East German companies already are feeling the
effects of Western competition.
   Many East German factories are expected to fail, causing wide
unemployment in the coming months. Workers in several industries
have staged ``warning strikes'' to press their demands for job
protection and better wages.
   The metalworkers contract ends a bitter confrontation.
   The contract was negotiated by the powerful West German labor
union IG Metall and its East German affiliate and covers 350,000
workers at 164 factories in an area around Berlin.
   Management said the pact may hasten the closing of enterprises
already struggling to meet their payrolls.
   ``This extensive compromise package is not economically
justifiable,'' Lothar Heinzmann, head of the employers group, said
in a statement carried by the East German news agency ADN.
   He called it ``an advance payment for an uncertain future.''
   In a statement, the union said the agreement keeps the burden of
moving to a free market from being placed ``fully on the workers.''
   The contract is expected to set a pattern for other labor
agreements currently being negotiated.
   ``It must be feared that factories will close because of this
contract,'' said Christoph Borchelt, spokesman for the employer
association, the Association of Metal and Electronics Industries of
Berlin and Brandenburg.
   The agreement raises the annual monthly salary of $666 to $850
through October, then to $880 through April 1, when the wage
portion of the contract expires.
   The job-guarantee section runs through June 1991, after which
workers can be laid off.
   The contract also increases the factories' participation in a
government program aimed at heading off layoffs.
   Under the program financed largely by West Germany, workers
targeted for layoffs receive 63 percent of their salaries while
remaining in the plants, where they receive training for other jobs.
   The contract will increase factory participation in the program,
raising the salaries of workers targeted by layoffs to 85 percent
of their former wages.
   About 220,000 East German workers nationwide are in such
programs and another 240,000 are expected to be added shortly, the
government said. About 162,000 workers are unemployed.
   Negotiations are continuing in other parts of metalworking and
electronics industries, a sector that employs 1.6 million of the
nation's 8 million workers.

opposition to giving financial aid to workers who lose their jobs
because of tougher pollution controls.
   The congressional talks lasted only an hour today and are
expected to drag on for weeks.
   Separate clean air bills passed by the House and Senate last
spring call for tougher pollution controls on factories,
automobiles and electric power plants, breezed through both the
House and Senate last spring. Their aim is to curb urban smog, cut
toxic industrial releases and acid rain pollution by the end of the
decade.
   But scores of differences will have to be resolved in the coming
weeks.
   A major issue will involved job protection for workers who
become unemployed by the tougher pollution controls. The House bill
contains a three-year, $250 million assistance program for such
workers and the Senate version does not.
   After today's House-Senate session, Roger Porter, President
Bush's chief domestic policy adviser, who will sit in on the talks,
said the administration remains ``fundamentally opposed'' to any
jobs protection provision and that he would recommend the president
veto legislation containing such a program.
   ``It sets a precedence that we're uncomfortable with,'' said
Porter in an interview.
   Even though no substantive agreements were reached in the first
session, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he
remained ``hopeful and certain'' that a compromise bill can be
worked out with the House before Congress is scheduled to adjourn
in early October.
   Many members of Congress would like to wrap up action on clean
air before the November election in view of polls that indicate the
environment and clean air are important voter concerns.
   Environmentalists on Thursday expressed concern that the tight
congressional schedule may jeopardize a strong clean air bill,
especially if it is held over for final action in a possible
lame-duck session after the November election.
   ``The time for (approving) a good bill is running out,'' Richard
Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition, said. He noted
that in 1976 a clean air bill won approval by both the House and
Senate and cleared a conference committee, only to die in the final
days of a session because of a Senate filibuster.
   The issue of job protection has dogged both the Senate and House
bills.
   In the Senate, an aid package for coal miners lost by only a
single vote after an emotional appeal by veteran Sen. Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va. The House approved a less ambitious assistance
measure, which calls for spending $250 million over three years in
extended unemployment compensation for workers in all industries
who lose their jobs to pollution controls.
   Lobbying by industry as well as environmental groups also is
expected to intensify during the talks, as both sides see the
conference as a last chance to influence the final law.
   Neither side completely likes either the House or Senate version.
   The auto industry is expected to fight the alternative-fuel
provision in the House bill. Under it, the industry this decade
would have to build 300,000 vehicles that use a fuel other than
gasoline as part of a pilot program in California.
   But a House provision on automobile tailpipe emission controls
is preferred by automakers over a similar version in the Senate
bill. Requirements in both bills for cleaner fuels in cities with
the worst smog problems is strongly opposed by the oil companies as
well as the White House because it allegedly favors an ethanol
blend over other fuels.
   Environmentalists will push to retain tougher toxic industrial
emission controls enacted by the House because they cover a broader
range of small polluters than the Senate bill. Industry argues the
House version will drive many small companies out of business.
   The administration, meanwhile, is expected to seek changes in
the House bill that call for new pollution controls for national
parks and for specific phaseout requirements for various chemicals
that harm the ozone layer.

   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley accused a
Republican Party leader today of trying to politicize the growing
savings and loan scandals with ``unrestrained and totally raw
partisanship.''
   Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, signed a
letter seeking a special prosecutor's investigation of a failed
Colorado savings and loan where President Bush's son Neil was a
director.
   Foley, D-Wash., responded sharply to comments a day earlier by
Ed Rollins, chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign
Committee, who urged party leaders to get on the offensive and
blame Democrats for the S&amp;L scandals.
   In his speech, Rollins said, ``For a few million dollars in
campaign contributions, the Democrats sold out the taxpayers.''
   Foley said Rollins ``sounded like he was in a panic'' and has
demonstrated he is an ``out of control person.''
   ``The fact is, he's a political operative, a hired gun,'' Foley
said. ``He's there to spread whatever mischief he can. ...
Certainly he's not the most composed, rational and fair minded man
in town in either party.''
   He called Rollins's remarks ``a wild statement'' and
``unrestrained and totally raw partisanship.''
   Foley's broadside came as 12 House Judiciary Committee Democrats
signed a letter asking Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to appoint
a special prosecutor to investigate the $1 billion failure of
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association.
   Republican House Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia charged the move
was politically motivated. ``I am sick of the stench of corruption
and hypocrisy which permeates the Democratic Party on Capitol
Hill,'' he said Thursday.
   But Thornburgh said he would consider the request and respond
within 30 days as the law requires.
   In another development Thursday involving Silverado, Rep. Frank
Annunzio, D-Ill., suggested that a $10,000 donation to the
Republicans by developer Ken Good could have been ``hush money'' to
block an investigation of the Denver thrift.
   Annunzio, who has accused the Bush administration of not
prosecuting savings and loan fraud vigorously, didn't provide
specific evidence to back up his allegation concerning the Nov. 2,
1988, donation.
   Good, a business partner of Neil Bush and a former shareholder
in Silverado, accused Annunzio of ``spreading vicious, false
accusations in the public arena without any basis.''
   ``No government agency at any level has accused me of any
wrongdoing,'' Good said in a statement issued by his attorney. He
said the donation was made two yars after he ended his relationship
with Silverado.
   Neil Bush has denied any wrongdoing, and the president has
defended the ``honor and integrity'' of his son at news
conferences. Neil Bush's attorney, James Nesland, said his client
would have no comment Thursday.
   The Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee said the
involvement of the president's son, Good and other political
contributors poses a conflict of interest in a Justice Department
investigation of Silverado.
   ``It's a clear-cut case for a special prosecutor,'' said Rep.
John Bryant, D-Texas, a member of the Judiciary committee who
signed the letter.
   But Gingrich said the Democrats were being hypocrites ``who
pretend they care about ethics and then exploit the president's son
for their own narrow partisan reasons.''
   If the Democrats move forward with their request, Gingrich said
he would press for special prosecutors to explore the role of seven
current and former Democratic lawmakers in the thrift crisis.
   Annunzio said officials of the Office of Thrift Supervision made
five criminal referrals concerning Silverado to the Justice
Department, but the thrift office has refused to give him the names
or dates of those referrals. He speculated that one of the
referrals could have involved Good.
   Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett said the names of any
people who might be involved wouldn't be made public since they
would be part of a pending investigation. He wouldn't confirm
whether Silverado referrals had been made to the department.
   Good donated more than $90,000 to Republican candidates in the
1987-88 period, including $5,750 for George Bush's presidential
bid, the Federal Election Commission said. About $85,000 was given
to candidates other than Bush in November 1988 just before the
elections.
   Records show Good contributed $750 in August 1986 and $5,000 in
October 1987 to the Bush presidential campaign, said FEC spokesman
Scott Moxley.
   During Neil Bush's tenure on its board, Silverado loaned Good
around $30 million that was never repaid. Federal regulators have
ordered the president's son to answer allegations of conflict of
interest in his role as a director of the thrift.
   Among others, the regulators allege that he failed to adequately
disclose his ties to Good.

   The lawyer for the family of a police cadet who
died after collapsing during the first day of training said today a
settlement has been reached in their lawsuit against the state.
   But lawyer Michael Hashim said he could not disclose the terms
of the settlement under an agreement reached with the state's
attorneys.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said Thursday he wants the Legislature
to include $1 million for Timothy Shepard's family in a deficiency
budget to cover costs during the fiscal year that ended June 30.
   But it was unclear whether the request would also include funds
to cover the medical bills of Shepard and the other injured cadets.
   Shepard's widow, Holly, sued the state and 14 others last
December, claiming that ``brutal, inhumane and life-threatening
training practices'' killed her 25-year-old husband.
   Other defendants in the suit included the Criminal Justice
Training Council, training academy officials and State Police
training officers.
   Shepard and 15 other recruits in the 50-member class became ill
during the first day of training, a hot day in September 1988, at
the Agawam training academy. Shepard died two months later.
   The incident led to changes in the way the state trains police
officers.

   The mayors of Moscow and Leningrad today joined
populist Boris N. Yeltsin and leaders of the reform bloc of the
Communist Party by quitting the party in the first split since the
time of Lenin.
   The dramatic events came as Mikhail S. Gorbachev was wrapping up
a personally victorious 28th party congress with adoption of new
party rules and the election of new members of the Central
Committee. In a secret battot, the delegates approved 412 members
of the policy-making Central Committee.
   ``All those who stand for democracy and socialism, we extend a
hand and call for their cooperation,'' President Gorbachev said in
a six-minute closing address that drew a standing ovation. The
delegates then sang the Communist anthem, ``The Internationale,''
to close the congress.
   Yeltsin, elected president of the Russian republic in May,
announced to a hushed congress Thursday that he was leaving the
Communist Party because his new post meant that he could no longer
obey only party policies.
   ``I have to obey the will of the people and their all-powerful
representatives,'' he said. ``Therefore in connection with my
obligations, I declare my exit from the party.''
   By quitting the party, Yeltsin became the first non-Communist
leader of Russia in 72 years of Soviet power.
   As the silver-haired reformer strode forcefully up the center
aisle in the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses, delegates shouted
``Shame!'' and whistled derisively. A very few, however, applauded.
   Gorbachev had no reaction, except to say that Yeltsin's decision
would not be discussed at the congress.
   Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov and Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak
issued a statement today saying they were quitting the party
because of its inability to offer a realistic program for
transition to a new society.
   ``Recognizing all the responsibility before the people and
history, we have taken a decision in the situation that arose to
leave the Communist Party in order to help create a multiparty
system,'' said their statement, released at the Moscow City Council.
   On Thursday, progressive delegates Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, a
leader of the Democratic Reform bloc, told the congress that he and
other progressive delegates, including Yuri Boldyrev of Leningrad
and Vladimir Lysenko of Moscow, were leaving the party and would
form their own independent organization.
   ``I am empowered to declare a division in the Communist Party,
and our intention to form an independent, democratic, parliamentary
party,'' Shostakovsky said, announcing the first split in the
Communist Party since 1921.
   Another delegate, Vladimir Polokholo, today announced the
formation of another new bloc, called Democratic Unity in the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union, designed to chip away at the
party's traditionalist bastion.
   ``The threat of a mass exodus from the party has not been
removed,'' he told the congress. It was not clear how many members
the bloc might attract, although within 30 minutes of his speech,
Polokholo had collected the signatures of 96 sympathetic delegates.
   For Gorbachev, the departure of the enormously popular Yeltsin
and members of the Democratic Platform represents a break in the
unity among reformers that he has been telling the congress was
essential ever since it convened on July 2.
   ``If perestroika fails, it will be because someone succeeds in
splitting the pro-perestroika forces,'' he said, referring to the
Russian word for his policy of restructuring the government and
economy.
   Yeltsin's resignation led the Soviet evening television news
program ``Vremya,'' whose announcer declared it a ``sensation.''
   Hard-liner Yegor K. Ligachev, who earlier in the day had been
defeated for the No. 2 party post by Gorbachev protege Vladimir A.
Ivashko, hinted that the party was better off without Yeltsin.
   ``There are people who, in leaving the party, could strengthen
it,'' said Ligachev.
   Gorbachev survived an onslaught by hard-line critics in the
congress earlier in the week and was re-elected party general
secretary.

<HEAD>Irish Envoy Waits For Word On Possible Hostage Release</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODEINA KENAAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Irish envoy waited in vain Friday for
word whether kidnapped Irish teacher Brian Keenan would be the
European hostage Iran's official news agency says will likely be
freed.
   Hopes of a weekend release diminished as Syrian President Hafez
Assad and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, a key figure in
arranging previous hostage releases, prepared to fly to Cairo
Saturday for a two-day visit.
   The summit with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will be the
final chapter in a reconciliation between Syria and Egypt that
ended a 12-year rift caused by Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with
Israel.
   Adrian McDaid, first secretary of the Irish Embassy in Baghdad,
which also oversees Irish affairs in Lebanon, flew to Beirut
Thursday ``to verify that Mr. Keenan will be the European hostage
released.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported last
Sunday that pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists might release a
hostage. It did not say who would be freed, but said it probably
would be one of the 10 European hostages.
   McDaid visited IRNA's Beirut office on Friday and met with the
agency's resident correspondent, Mussayeb Naimih.
   ``We stressed that our sources are reliable and we explained to
Mr. McDaid that the hostage to be released will probably be a
European national,'' Naimih told The Associated Press.
   ``He asked us about the reports that said Keenan will be
released and we explained to him that our report did not name the
hostage,'' Naimih said.
   Before visiting IRNA, McDaid had spent the day at the Irish
consulate in Moslem west Beirut, waiting for the kidnappers or
other Moslem leaders to contact him. But consulate sources said no
one did.
   ``I'm here to collect information about the possible release of
Mr. Brian Keenan. We don't have official confirmation that it will
be him but we are hopeful that it will be him,'' McDaid said.
   Sources close to the headquarters of the Syrian Army in Lebanon
said there were no indications that the release of any of the 16
Western captives was imminent.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Brig. Gen.
Ghazi Kenaan, commander of Syrian military intelligence in Lebanon,
was in Syria, which ``indicates that nothing major is cooking'' for
the time being.
   Kenaan has always been in Beirut for previous releases, when
hostages are usually handed over to Syrian Intelligence and driven
to Damascus to be repatriated.
   Sources close to Syrian army command in Beirut have speculated
that Keenan will be freed.
   Keenan, a 39-year-old English language teacher from Belfast, was
kidnapped in west Beirut April 11, 1986, as he walked to the
American University of Beirut where he worked.
   The other Western captives are six Americans, four Britons, two
West Germans, two Swiss and an Italian. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
   Officials and diplomats in Damascus noted Thursday that a
hostage release was not likely before Assad and Sharaa return.
   McDaid said the duration of his stay in Lebanon ``depends on
developments.''
   No group has claimed to hold Keenan or made any demands for his
release.
   But former hostage Frank Reed, an American educator who was
freed April 30, said he saw Keenan two days before his release.
   He said he had spent almost three years in the same house or
room with him and kidnapped British journalist John McCarthy.
   A group called Islamic Dawn announced Reed's release.

<TEXT>
   Fire raced through a storage area at a
Kerr-McGee Corp. plant, destroying 100 tons of a fuel oxidizer used
in the space shuttle and military rockets.
   Authorities credited a new storage system mandated after a
disastrous blast at a neighboring plant two years ago with averting
a more serious fire or explosion.
   Fire and company officials say 106.5 tons of ammonium
perchorlate was destroyed in the blaze late Thursday. Damage was
estimated at $200,000, according to Rick Stater, operations manager
at the plant.
   Kerr-McGee produces about 1,500 tons of ammonium perchlorate per
month, according to Stater.
   Stater and fire officials credited new fire safety regulations
with averting a disaster similar to one on May 4, 1988, when an
explosion of ammonium perchlorate destroyed the Pacific Engineering
Co. (Pepcon) plant a mile from the Kerr-McGee facility.
   Kerr-McGee and Pepcon were the only companies in the United
States producing the critical fuel oxidizer, and the loss of the
Pepcon plant left U.S. officials faced with a possible shortage of
the critical fuel element.
   Pepcon has since rebuilt a new plant in Cedar City, Utah.
   The Pepcon blast killed two people and injured more than 300.
The blast rocked the Las Vegas Valley and cause more than $74
million in property damage, primarily in this community of 55,000,
some 25 miles southeast of Las Vegas.
   Following the Pepcon blast, Clark County fire officials imposed
strict new fire safety codes at the Kerr-McGee plant. Included was
a provision that ammonium perchlorate be stored on separate pads,
with concrete walls separating the pads.

<TEXT>
   Negotiations to end Liberia's
civil war were at an impasse Friday, but the head of the rebel
delegation said he was prepared for more talks next week.
   Thomas Woewiyu, the chief rebel delegate, said he had conferred
with the mediation committee of the Economic Community of West
African States for two days and was returning to Liberia to report
to rebel leader Charles Taylor.
   ``There has been absolutely no cease-fire and no agreement for
an occupation of Liberia by ECOWAS forces,'' Woewiyu said,
referring to the organization.
   But, he said, the rebels were willing to sit down with members
of the economic group ``to find a way to peace without any
preconditions.''
   In the Liberian capital of Monrovia, power had been restored to
a small area of the city for the first time in two weeks. The
government also said it was sending technicians to power plants to
try to resume regular power supplies.
   Water remained cut off.
   The road out of Monrovia to neighboring Sierra Leone also was
reported open, although numerous government checkpoints made travel
slow.
   The Liberian government's delegation to the talks was led by
Senate President Tambakai Jangaba. But Woewiyu and Jangaba did not
meet during the current round and did not jointly attend any
meeting of the mediation committee.
   There was no immediate comment from the Liberian government on
the talks, which began Thursday.
   ``It's a waste of time talking to the delegation of the Liberian
government,'' Woewiyu said. ``There is no Liberian government.''
   However, he said he would return to Freetown for more talks on
Monday. Abbas Bundu, secretary-general of the mediation committee,
said the talks would resume Tuesday.
   The rebel delegation commandeered a fishing boat from the
rebel-held port of Buchanan to travel to Freetown on Wednesday
night.
   Rebel forces invaded from neighboring Ivory Coast on Dec. 24 and
since have taken control of more than two-thirds of Liberian
territory. They have been advancing on the capital and now are
fighting government troops in the suburbs of Monrovia.
   The guerrillas accuse President Samuel K. Doe's government of
corruption, tribalism and suppressing the opposition. They have
said they will lay down their arms only after Doe leaves office.
   Doe took power in a 1980 coup that ousted elitist descendants of
American slaves who founded Liberia in 1847.
   Taylor supports capitalism, but Washington and other governments
have questioned his commitment to democracy.

<HEAD>Military Group Claims Responsibility for Bombings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six bombs exploded Friday, causing
damage but no casualties, and an anonymous caller claimed the
explosives were planted by military dissidents opposed to President
Corazon Aquino.
   Troops and police went on full alert in the capital following
the pre-dawn blasts, which occurred in the tourist and financial
districts. Unexploded bombs were also found in cars at the Silahis
Hotel and Philippine Plaza Hotel and on two trucks in the Paco
district.
   Three rifle grenades were also found in a plastic bag near the
headquarters of an American-sponsored foundation.
   An anonymous caller told the private television station ABS-CBN
the bombs were the work of the underground Reform the Armed Forces
Movement. The station said the caller, who claimed to be a military
officer, said the bombings were part of a ``test mission'' for new
recruits to the organization.
   The dissident military group led the February 1986 revolt
against the late President Ferdinand Marcos, which triggered the
uprising that propelled Mrs. Aquino into office.
   Later, the group turned against Mrs. Aquino and played a major
role in at least three of the six coup attempts against her. The
most recent was a December coup that left 113 people dead.
   Earlier, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said the chief
suspects in the attacks were right-wing military dissidents seeking
to topple Aquino.
   Brig. Gen. Marino Filart, chief of the police Capital Command,
ordered round-the-clock checkpoints established throughout
metropolitan Manila, which has a population of almost 8 million.
   The military chief of staff, Gen. Renato De Villa, appealed to
the public to ``remain calm and go about their usual activities.''
   He called the bombings the work of ``a handful of extremists.''
   Small-scale bombings have often preceeded coup attempts against
Mrs. Aquino, but De Villa said there was no indication of a coup
attempt. ``Coup plotters do not have a capability to launch a major
attack at the moment,'' he said.
   Mayor Gemiliano Lopez said the explosions were aimed at
discrediting the government and scaring off foreign investors. He
said he was calling an emergency meeting of hotel managers,
business leaders and private security firms to discuss ways to
prevent bombings.
   Guards were stationed at the entrances of several luxury hotels
to check belongings of those entering.

   The last time a trolley lumbered from Los
Angeles to Long Beach was in 1961, when the Pacific Electric Red
Car line died of neglect by car-crazed Southern Californians.
   The Red Cars first rolled on July 4, 1902, when thousands jammed
the trolleys for an inaugural ride through scenic countryside and
farming communities like Compton.
   Clean beaches with lively waves, an enormous heated saltwater
bathhouse and a growing amusement zone known as the Pike awaited
them in Long Beach. Accommodations ranged from fancy hotels to tent
camps.
   In the decades since, nothing at the start, the middle, or the
end of the 22 miles of track has remained the same. Only the route
of the new Blue Line trains beginning service this weekend is
identical.
   Barely a city a century ago, Los Angeles has become the
country's second largest metropolis. Traffic is terrible and the
air can be dirty. Police battle street gangs. Its infrastructure is
aging and nearing the breaking point.
   Despite its problems, Los Angeles continues to attract new waves
of immigrants.
   Long Beach has turned from tourism to become a top-ranked
seaport, oil producer and business center. But the city also had
the state's largest crime increase last year, much of includes ``Kojak,''
``The Rockford Files,''
``Baretta'' and CBS' old late-night ``Night Heat.'' With the
one-hour ``Top Cops,'' he's entering what is known as ``reality''
TV.
   In each show, three real police officers recount the most
memorable experiences of their careers as each of their stories is
recreated, with actors playing the cops.
   The premiere includes the tale of Paul Ragonese of the New York
Police Department's bomb squad, and how he felt when helping disarm
a particularly complex bomb containing 15 sticks of dynamite.
   The bomb was found in mid-December 1986 in an empty abortion
clinic in Manhattan. It had been put there by a madman whose target
was the bomb squad.
   The man later surrendered, got a three-year prison term and was
out in two, Grosso says.
   ``I'm really trying to let people understand what it's like'' to
be a cop, he says. ``And that those streets out there are telling
us every day, `Something ain't working, pal.' ''
   Despite 14 years in the entertainment business, Grosso's heart,
as you might expect, remains with cops.
   ``One thing you have going in the police department is that any
cop, no matter who he is, can get a call, `man with a gun' or
`family dispute,' and be right in the middle, his life on the
line,'' he says.
   ``Whereas so many people in this business never take a chance,
never go out on a limb, and never understand the camaraderie, never
understand what it means to get along with people you work with
because you're dependent upon them for your safety.''

   The gunslinger of the Old West may be
poised for a comeback _ in Mississippi, because of a loophole in a
new gun law.
   On July 1, the state's new gun permit law went into effect. And
to the chagrin of the governor, lawmakers and law enforcement
officials, it allows most Mississippians to tote concealed handguns
almost anywhere _ including sports events, bars and even the state
Capitol.
   An 11th-hour attempt to fix the flawed legislation failed in a
special legislative session last month, and law enforcement
officials fear its looseness will allow the wrong people to be
armed _ and in the wrong places.
   ``It's the law, and we've got to live with it,'' said Sharkey
County Sheriff Joe Ford, president of the Mississippi Sheriff's
Association.
   The law allows Mississippians over age 21 willing to pay $100
for a three-year permit to carry a concealed weapon. The only
exceptions are convicted felons, fugitives, drug and alcohol
abusers, the mentally incompetent, illegal aliens, those
dishonorably discharged from the military, those who renounce their
citizenship or those who falsify permit applications.
   Applicants must undergo background checks, be fingerprinted and
photographed. But the background check requirement is indicative of
what critics say is the sloppiness of the law.
   It says that applications are to be issued within 30 days, but
the state Department of Public Safety says such checks with the FBI
take about six weeks. It's also not clear when the 30-day period is
intended to start.
   And law enforcement officials complain there's no provision for
revoking the permits, which are automatically renewable.
   The law began as a state Senate bill to allow judges to carry
handguns. But it evolved in the House into a bill to loosen up an
old law that defined a weapon as concealed if any part of it was
not open to view.
   Lawmakers have since admitted they made a mistake. But they
failed to pass a cleanup bill at last month's special session.
   Unless Gov. Ray Mabus calls a special session _ for which there
are no plans _ the law stays on the books until the Legislature can
act when it meets in regular session in early January.
   The Mississippi Rifle and Pistol Association, an affliate of the
National Rifle Association, lobbied for the passage of the law, but
with the understanding that the glitches would be ironed out, said
group president David Hawkins.
   Hawkins said he was disappointed that the cleanup bill was not
passed. ``It was a very good compromise .. a bill we all liked and
something we could live with. That's what we wanted passed,'' he
said.
   State and law enforcement officials in Mississippi are still
assessing what has happened and what can be done, said Cliff
Treyens, a spokesman for Mabus.
   Officials hope to have a solution by the end of the month,
possibly before the first of the permits are issued.
   Applications are accepted only on Wednesday, beginning with this
week. On the first day, 426 people sought permits.
   In 1987, Florida also had to fix a flaw in a new concealed
weapons law after lawmakers inadvertently repealed a provision that
prohibited people from carrying firearms openly in public.
   Once the glitch was discovered, lawmakers came back into session
to repeal it and are now satisified with the amended law, said
Robin Hassler, staff director of the Florida House of
Representatives's committee on criminal justice.
   Lawmakers say Mississippi's law, once it is amended, will be
similar to Florida's.

   Nigerians who smoke in public places could
be jailed for up to two years under a decree published Friday by
the military government.
   The law, published in Lagos newspapers, prohibits smoking in
cinemas, elevators, schools, offices and on public transportation.
   The new law also limits broadcast and newspaper advertisements
for cigarettes, requiring them to include warnings that smoking
could cause cancer.
   Companies that violate the law can be fined and their directors
jailed.
   The health minister, Dr. Olikoye Ransome Kuti, had been
campaigning vigorously for such a law for two years.

   An organization of Protestant, Roman Catholic
and Eastern Orthodox publications has strongly protested
restrictive moves on the Southern Baptist news agency and ouster
orders against its top editors.
   ``We are alarmed that responsible and respected journalists have
been penalized and dismissed for their proper reporting of the
news,'' officers of The Associated Church Press said in a letter
sent to officials of the Southern Baptist Convention.
   The organization represents 195 periodicals of various
denominations and independent religious publications.
   The letter, dated Tuesday, was sent to the Rev. Morris H.
Chapman, new president of the Southern Baptists, who are now
controlled by a fundamentalist wing, and to its executive committee.
   That committee has scheduled a special meeting in Nashville,
Tenn., next Tuesday to deal with the chief editors of Baptist
Press, Al Shackleford and Dan Martin, who have been put under an
ultimatum to resign or be fired.
   The agency, which serves 38 weeklies of the 14.9-million-member
denomination and also about 400 other news outlets, has been
prohibited in the meantime from carrying news of the affair.
   Declaring the steps ``adversely affects the credibility of
religious journalism in North America,'' Donald F. Hetzler,
executive director of the transdenominational press group, and its
president, Mary Lou Redding, wrote:
   ``What makes this situation especially regrettable is that
Southern Baptist Press has earned a high degree of credibility and
trust among secular press agencies for its open, balanced reporting
of controversial matters.''
   Chapman has declined comment on actions against the news agency
editors, but said ``the feeling has surfaced ... that there seemed
to be a bias that leaned toward the moderate perspective in the
convention.''
   The letter came as various others, including editors of Baptist
weeklies across the country, decried the crackdown on the news
agency that was launched by officers of the denomination's now
ruling fundamentalist officers.
   Television journalist Bill Moyers, defending the journalistic
integrity of Shackleford and Martin, said a key fundamentalist
strategist, Houston Judge Paul Pressler, had ``shamelessly
engineered'' the action against them.
   In a letter to editors of Baptist newspapers, Moyers urged them
``to rise to challenge this vindictive act and the bully who is
responsibile. ... He rules the Southern Baptist Convention like a
swaggerring Caesar, breaking good men when it pleases him.''
   Pressler, reported out of the country and unavailable for
comment, is vice chairman of the denomination's executive
committee, and has frequently criticized Baptist Press.
   Moyers, a lifelong Southern Baptist, said the two longtime
editors were being ``dumped on the street'' because they ``refused
to dishonor their calling ... and refused to be lackeys for Paul
Pressler.''
   Meanwhile, Nashville attorney Frank Ingraham, a Southern Baptist
opponent of fundamentalist tactics, appealed to its executive
committee for a fair hearing for the editors.
   In a letter to the committee chairman, the Rev. Sam W. Pace of
Lawton, Okla., Ingraham, protested indications that it would
arbitrarily act Tuesday on a ``motion to terminate'' Shackleford
and Martin ``without discussion.''
   Pleading for a chance to defend them, Ingraham asked if the
committee was going to deny Southern Baptists ``the opportunity to
judge the reasonableness of your actions'' or ``make a display of
raw power.''
   ``Certainly, Baptists in the pews of the churches of our
convention will call you to account for these arbitrary displays of
raw power,'' Ingraham wrote. ``They will ferret out those
responsible and ... deal with them appropriately.''

   Tom Cruise stole the thunder of his Hollywood
peers by getting People magazine's annual sexiest man alive award
Friday.
   Cruise's role in the movie ``Days of Thunder'' made him an
all-American ``hot-rod hero,'' said the magazine, announcing its
sixth annual determination of the world's most desirable male.
   The sexiest thing about Cruise? ``His eyes,'' says Valeria
Golino, his ``Rain Man'' co-star. ``Not their color. His regard _
the way he looks with them. They're very alive.''
   He's also ``the boy next door as daredevil,'' the magazine said,
detailing his delight for race-car driving and skydiving.
   Cruise has gone skydiving with current flame Nicole Kidman, who
co-stars in ``Days of Thunder'' as a brain surgeon, and with his
mother, Mary Lee, the magazine said in next week's issue.
   Previous sexiest men alive winners are: Sean Connery, John F.
Kennedy Jr., Harry Hamlin, Mark Harmon and Mel Gibson.
   Cruise was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in ``Born
on the Fourth of July.'' He also starred in ``The Color of Money''
and ``Risky Business.''

   British rock star David Bowie stopped his
concert to take up the cause of the rap group 2 Live Crew and its
right to produce and perform its music.
   ``I've been listening to the album by 2 Live Crew,'' he said
Thursday night after stopping in the middle of the song, ``Young
Americans.''
   ``It's not the best album that's ever been made, but when I
heard they banned it, I went out and bought it,'' Bowie said.
   ``Freedom of thought, freedom of speech _ it's one of the most
important things we have,'' he said to cheers from the capacity
crowd at the Spectrum.
   ``What's happening is the thin end of a very fat wedge,'' he
said.
   In an incredulous voice, he referred to the banning of certain
books by some U.S. libraries.
   ``I mean there are libraries in this country where you can't
read (the novelist) Ray Bradbury or (Ernest) Hemingway,'' said the
flamboyant 42-year-old singer.
   ``That's the end of my speech,'' he said, before finishing
``Young Americans,'' during the third of four concerts here.
   Authorities arrested members of 2 Live Crew in Florida recently
after a federal judge in Fort Lauderdale declared the group's
lyrics obscene.

   Cable chieftain Ted Turner says the United
States should make friends with Fidel Castro. When it comes to
Turner's own relationship with actress Jane Fonda, it's pleasure,
not business.
   Commenting about a recent interview he conducted with the Cuban
leader, Turner said he never intended for the piece to be
hard-hitting journalism.
   ``Maybe Sam Donaldson would have done a better job, but he
didn't get him,'' Turner said. Since Castro didn't do any other
interviews, Turner said, ``it's better than nothing.''
   Turner's typically saucy remarks came Thursday during a
question-and-answer session with reporters at an annual television
network media tour, sponsored by the networks.
   The Cable News Network owner responded to media critics'
conclusions that his Castro interview televised last month on CNN
was a fluff piece.
   ``I just asked the questions. I didn't grill him. I've been
trying to build bridges all over the world,'' Turner said. ``I
think we could really be friends with the Cubans and Castro.''
   Seated in the front row of was Turner's sometime companion, Miss
Fonda. The actress, who donned dark glasses midway through Turner's
talk, was mentioned a few times by the cable czar.
   Asked why Fonda has not participated in a Turner program, he
replied: ``We made an agreement to separate business and pleasure.''

   Gay rights protesters climbed onto a
stage inches from Princess Diana and demanded the right to raise
children in alternative environments.
   Many of the 2,000 delegates to the 16th International Congress
for the Family, which the princess opened, jeered and shouted
``shame'' as the four women and one man marched across the stage on
Thursday.
   The princess blushed but sat calmly, looking composed.
   The protesters carried pink placards spelling out the message:
``Lesbian mothers are not pretending.''
   ``The delegates to this congress are trying to make people
believe that lesbian mothers and gay men looking after children are
not real families but are pretend family groups,'' said protest
leader Danielle Ahrens, 21.
   ``We are not pretending and we have no lesser values than any
other family,'' Ahrens said.
   The princess' decision to open the four-day congress, which
strongly opposes abortion, was criticized by family planning
groups. Sharing the platform with the princess at the Brighton
Center in this south England seaport resort was Cardinal Basil
Hume, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Westminster.
   In her speech, the princess cautioned delegates.
   ``In all your deliberations you should remember that the very
idea of the human family has many different definitions, and
perhaps those who depend on it most _ the young, the old, the sick
and the lonely _ can really claim to know its meaning,'' she said.

   Senior Soviet military officers on Friday welcomed
the visit of NATO leader Manfred Woerner as an important step in
resolving differences between the Western alliance and the Warsaw
Pact.
   ``Before, we could not even imagine such a visit, but now things
are changing so rapidly that even this is possible,'' said army
Gen. Valentin Varennikov, chief of Soviet ground forces.
   ``I expect this visit concretely to bring our points of view
closer together,'' he said.
   Woerner is the first NATO general secretary to visit the Soviet
Union.
   He arrived Friday evening and said the aim of his visit was to
convey a message of peace and friendship to the Soviet Union from
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Tass news agency
reported.
   Woerner was greeted at Moscow's Vnukovo-2 Airport by Soviet
deputy foreign ministers Yuli Kvitsinsky and Viktor Karpov, as well
as ambassadors and charges d'affaires of NATO countries.
   Only high-ranking officers, all delegates to the 28th Communist
Party congress, appeared willing to discuss the trip.
   ``This is a positive step,'' Lt. Gen. Yuri Alexeievich said
during a break in the congress only hours before Woerner arrived.
``It will help stimulate relations between the two blocs and we
think these relations should be stronger and stronger.''
   Varennikov linked Woerner's visit to the invitation extended to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to address NATO members at the
alliance's headquarters in Brussels.
   ``These are historical steps that can bring our alliances closer
together,'' he said.
   Less than a year ago, NATO and the Warsaw Pact were defending
the Cold War, but events in Eastern Europe have led military
leaders to rethink the role of their alliances.
   ``I never thought this would happen. We were enemies and
suddenly there is a friendly visit of a general secretary of NATO
coming to Moscow,'' said Lt. Gen. David Dorogonsky.
   The medal-laden officer said he thought Woerner's visit would
help pave the way for the alliances to work as partners.
   ``Gradually, the role of the Warsaw Pact and NATO must be
transformed into political organs,'' Dorogonsky said. ``I would
like to see the Warsaw Pact and NATO be partners, not in war, but
in peace, and I expect our two sides will be able to take a big
step toward better understanding.''
   Added Lt. Gen. Alexeievich: ``The more that people from
different countries meet and talk, the more they will be able to
solve their problems. I am expecting an improvement in the
political climate of Europe.''

<HEAD>Hungarian Communists Gave Haven to Terrorist Carlos, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX BANDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's former Communist regime
apparently allowed the international terrorist Carlos to use the
country as a base while he carried out attacks in Austria and West
Germany, officials said Friday.
   East German officials recently announced that Carlos also had
found safe haven in their country under the Communist government
toppled late last year.
   Carlos, also known as ``the Jackal,'' has already been blamed
for an attack on OPEC ministers in Vienna in Dec. 21, 1975 that
left three people dead.
   The chief public prosecutor's office in Budapest disclosed
Friday that Carlos also is believed responsible for the 1981
bombing of Radio Free Europe headquarters in Munich in which four
people were seriously injured.
   The U.S.-funded organization broadcasts reports to the countries
of Eastern Europe, many of which were ruled by hard-line Communist
governments until pro-democracy revolutions swept the region last
year.
   Asked about the prosecutor's office statement, which was carried
by the official MTI news agency, a Radio Free Europe spokeswoman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no group had been linked
to the attack before.
   The Hungarian statement was the latest in a series of
revelations that the Moscow-educated terrorist had operated from at
least two former Soviet bloc capitals while terrorizing Western
Europe. Carlos, a Venezuelan, remains at large.
   East German officials recently announced that Carlos also had
found safe haven in their country under the Communist government
toppled late last year.
   The first indication that he had been welcome in Hungary
surfaced June 27. At that time, Interior Minister Balazs Horvath
said that former Communist Party officials provided shelter and
training facilities for Carlos, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez
Sanchez.
   One of the documents produced by Horvath to back up the
allegations was a letter allegedly written by Carlos to late
Communist Party leader Janos Kadar in 1980. ``From our base in
Hungary, we have developed our international ties, getting in
contact with the revolutions of every nation without any hindrance
on the part of the Hungarian authorities,'' the letter purportedly
said.
   State television a week ago showed what it termed the first film
footage of Carlos in which intelligence agents tried to persuade
him to leave Hungary.
   Besides alleging that Carlos masterminded the Radio Free Europe
attack and the OPEC attack while operating from Hungary, the
prosecutor's office also said he was suspected of piling up an
arsenal of weapons, explosives and ammunition while in Budapest
between 1979 and 1985.
   ``There is well-founded suspicion ... that Hungarian officials
and others provided active support for committing these crimes or
were accomplices,'' the chief public prosecutor said. ``Therefore
investigations have been ordered.''
   Carlos, the son of a wealthy Communist lawyer, also has been
linked with a bombing Dec. 31, 1984, in Marseille that killed five
people and wounded 41.
   He is also accused of plotting the 1975 hijacking of an Air
France jetliner to Uganda that ended with the Israeli commando raid
at Entebbe airport.

   Six months after he squeaked into office, Mayor
David Dinkins is taking steady steps toward national political
prominence.
   Attacked in the election as indecisive and fiscally incompetent,
Dinkins has netted a string of successes that indicate otherwise.
He has balanced a painful budget, salved racial wounds, gracefully
escorted Nelson Mandela.
   And this week came his latest coup: winning the 1992 Democratic
National Convention for the city, a prize worth $100 million to the
economy and uncountable sums in boosting New York's sometimes
beleaguered image.
   ``He has done excellently. ... There's nothing about his
performance that I don't like right now,'' Gov. Mario Cuomo said in
an interview. ``He's a leader now. He's a national voice right
now.''
   ``He is doing very well, and I applaud him for it,'' said former
Mayor Edward I. Koch, whom Dinkins toppled after 12 years in
office. ``There were people who worried about his ability to make
decisions on the budget. He has demolished that fear.''
   Dinkins is the first black to serve as mayor of the nation's
most populous city. He often cites his Marines service as a
formative experience in his life. Unlike the voluble and sometimes
abrasive Koch, he is a quiet conciliator, a negotiator and a
champion of tolerance.
   ``Ed Koch was a confrontational mayor, a verbally provocative
mayor,'' said Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center
at New York University. ``Dinkins' verbal skills have been to allay
racial fears and urge restraint. This is a great change after
Koch.''
   Political analysts say some of Dinkins' attraction has simply
been the change of tone. And he may have been aided by low
expectations.
   ``People voted for him with hope, but not with much
confidence,'' said David Garth, Koch's longtime political media
adviser. When Dinkins won November's election by only 40,000 votes,
said Garth, ``There was great suspicion'' of his strength.
   ``The expectations of David Dinkins ... weren't as high as they
should have been. He's benefited from that,'' said Cuomo.
   But he has earned his accolades. Confronted with a huge budget
gap, Dinkins responded with $850 million in spending cuts and $850
million in tax increases, mainly income and property taxes.
   Verdict: ``As good as Koch if not better,'' said Charles
Brecher, research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, a
watchdog group. ``He handled the budget extremely well,'' said
Felix Rohatyn, the financier who engineered the city's recovery
from its 1970s fiscal crisis.
   Next came race relations. Faced with tensions surrounding the
Bensonhurst racial killing trial and a black boycott of a Korean
grocery, Dinkins asked for prime time on local television. He used
it for an impassioned speech urging racial harmony.
   It was well received. ``As a spiritual leader, he put the black
middle class in the forefront, rather than the street radicals,''
said Moss.
   At times the speech seemed a lecture on civility. ``David in a
way is a kindly father figure. He has basically said to the city,
`You have to be in by 11,'' said political consultant Norman Adler.
   Mandela's visit last month was another success.
   ``No way in the world Mandela would have spent one night in
Gracie Mansion with Ed Koch,'' said Moss. But Mandela spent three
nights as Dinkins' guest at the mayor's residence. ``The Mandela
visit gave David Dinkins an opportunity to position himself as a
national and international urban leader,'' Moss added.
   ``What he's starting to build is a certain kind of respect,''
said Garth. ``In the beginning it was begrudging. Now it's serious
respect. If he can get through the next year, that kind of respect
can grow into a national image.''

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl travels to
Moscow this weekend in another effort to soothe Soviet concerns
about German unification and win approval for a united Germany's
membership in NATO.
   Traveling with Kohl are Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
and Finance Minister Theo Waigel, whose presence has fueled rumors
that Kohl will propose some form of financial aid to the Soviets.
Sources in Bonn, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no new
financial aid was in the offing.

open market. Bonn has also agreed to pay $780 million toward the
upkeep of Soviet soldiers in East Germany in the second half of
this year.
   At this week's summit of the world's leading democratic
financial powers in Houston, leaders rejected a bid by West
Germany, France and Italy to put together a $15 billion aid plan to
help the moribund Soviet economy.
   West German government spokesman Hans Klein, briefing reporters
Friday on Kohl's visit, said the visit was ``in support of
progressing the two-plus-four talks on the way to achieving a
united Germany in the Western alliance.''
   The ``two-plus-four'' talks bring together the foreign ministers
of the two Germanys and the World War II victors _ the United
States, Soviet Union, France and Britain _ to work out the
international ramifications of German unification, expected by the
end of this year.
   During his visit, Kohl will meet with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and has been invited to stop Sunday in Stavropol,
Gorbachev's hometown.
   Klein said West Germany considered the invitation to Stavropol
``an especially personal gesture and a good omen.''
   The Germanys have already merged their economies and social
welfare systems and are working on resolving legal and
constitutional issues so that all-German elections and full German
unification can take place by December.
   One of the major obstacles to international approval for German
unification has been the Soviets' rejection of membership in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization for a united Germany. East
Germany was the Soviets' first line of defense against the West,
and Moscow has about 380,000 of its top troops stationed there.
   Klein said Kohl would emphasize ``especially clearly, that our
politics are embedded in the area of the North Atlantic alliance
and the European Community.''
   Kohl's Moscow trip also follows the NATO summit in London, where
leaders pledged to reduce both nuclear and conventional defenses in
Europe and said they had ``no aggressive intentions'' toward the
Soviet Union. They also said NATO would not ``in any circumstance
be the first to use force.''
   During the NATO summit, the Germans also promised to announce by
the fall their plans for troop cutbacks in a united Germany.

   Vice President Dan Quayle told families of
missing servicemen Friday that he'll never apologize for his
Vietnam-era service in the National Guard, but that those who
fought made a ``far, far greater'' sacrifice than he.
   Quayle noted his National Guard service, which became an issue
in the 1988 presidential campaign, in a speech opening the 21st
annual meeting of the 3,650-member National League of Families of
American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia.
   ``As you know, during the Vietnam era, I served in the Indiana
National Guard,'' he said. ``And while I have not apologized, and
never will, for my National Guard service, I recognize that the
members of my generation who served in Vietnam made a sacrifice for
their country that was far, far greater than mine.
   ``The men and women who served in Vietnam were heroes _ not just
because of their deeds of valor _ but because they served at a time
when words like duty, honor and country had lost their meaning for
many,'' Quayle said. ``For the rest of my life, I will live in
admiration of their courage.''
   Quayle was given a standing ovation at the conclusion of his
remarks.
   As George Bush's running mate, Quayle was dogged by accusations
that he avoided combat duty by joining the National Guard.
   The issue surfaced again May 9 when some members of the American
Legion of Paris boycotted a ceremony commemorating the late
President Eisenhower's World War II service as Supreme Allied
Commander. The vice president spoke at the ceremony in the French
capital.
   Quayle, who was to speak later Friday to the Republican National
Committee in Chicago, also told the POW-MIA group that the
``fullest possible accounting'' of missing servicemen ``will
continue to be a matter of highest national priority until we
achieve success.''
   ``We will do everything a government can do to recover your
loved ones,'' he aid. ``And, if we discover proof of captivity,
action will be taken to bring our men home.''
   He added, however, that U.S. efforts ``can be fully productive
only if Vietnam makes the political decision truly to cooperate
with us.''
   ``The Vietnamese government must realize that cooperation now,
to clear up this issue of tremendous national concern, can remove
the last vestige of the war and lay the groundwork for improved
relations in the context of a comprehensive settlement in
Cambodia,'' he said.
   Another group, the newly formed National Alliance of Families
for the Return of American Servicemen, was holding a forum later in
the day on its belief that as many as 5,000 prisoners of war from
the Korean war may have remained in Chinese and Soviet labor camps
and some could still be alive.
   However, Betsy Cox, public relations director of the larger
group, said there was ``absolutely no intelligence to back up such
assertions.''
   State Department and Defense Department officials also have said
there is no verifiable evidence to support such claims.
   Sig Harbak of Seattle, an organizer of the smaller alliance,
said the Defense Department declined an invitation to attend that
group's meeting.
   Alliance members want public disclosure of information in
government files concerning POW-MIA personnel from World War II,
the Korean War and Vietnam. The bill they support would exempt
information that would compromise national security by disclosing
sources and methods of intelligence.
   The League of Families opposes that legislation, saying it could
jeopardize Americans who might still be held.

   There's something magical about Friday
the 13th for Margaret Dailey. She was married 21 years ago on the
date and this year she was transformed into the new president of
the Society of American Magicians.
   The Indianapolis woman becomes the society's magical matriach,
governing the group that has an 88-year history and once was led by
the legendary master of legerdemain, Harry Houdini.
   Nearly 1,000 amateur and professional performers of the art of
magic have gathered in this city to amaze, be amazed, surprise, be
surprised and to share the latest secrets of now-you-see it and
now-you don't.
   Dealers in magic paraphernalia offer up modern miracles ranging
in price from a few bucks for devices to make silk handkerchiefs
disappear to thousands of dollars to make lovely women appear out
of small cages.
   And in nearly every nook and cranny of the convention site one
can see 20-foot flames spring from bare hands, cards and coins
levitate, or you can ``pick a card, any card'' and it's certain to
turn up in the most unexpected places in the most unexpected way.
   Dailey, a performer in her own right, is married to past
national president of the society, Frank W. Dailey. She unabashedly
tells wives of performers, ``If you fall in love with a magician,
the magic will never go out of your life.''
   Her installation as president became official Friday the 13th, a
date that holds no fear for Dailey. She and Frank were married on a
Friday the 13th in June 1969.
   The field of magic has gone and is undergoing a subtle
metamorphosis. The trusty old rabbit in the hat has given way to
high tech wonders where solid safety pins link and unlink, where
the watch in your hand changes time at the magician's command.
   Electronics and computer miniaturization have replaced trap
doors, mirrors and wires. The new technology is a high-priced
specialty of Rich Bloch of Collectors Workshop in Washington, D.C.
   Among Bloch's gadgets is a $135 device that will send a stream
of playing cards flying out of your pocket.
   The image of the tuxedoed dandy who plucked coins and cards out
of nowhere and sawed a woman in half has also given way to the
modern times with the election of Dailey, who declined to give her
age, but is a mother of three daughters and grandmother to 11.
   There are the superstars who are society members, such as David
Copperfield and Harry Blackstone Jr., but most members, according
to Dailey, are people from all walks of life who have an interest
in magic.
   Typical of the new breed of magician is Sister Carol Ann, a nun
from Stamford who is also an honorary assistant coach for the New
York Giants.
   Sister Carol Ann said she has entertained the Giants before big
games with magic, including a special effect that involved burning
a $100 bill and restoring it _ without divine intervention.
   ``They enjoyed that so much, they did the wave for me,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Parliament Votes to Sell Off State Industry in Big Reform Step</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers Friday voted to sell off
Poland's state industries, a major step in the Solidarity-led
government's 7-month-old program of radical economic reforms
designed to build a market economy.
   The author of those reforms, Deputy Prime Minister Leszek
Balcerowicz, described the legislation as ``the most fundamental
bill ever passed by the Polish parliament.''
   The government owns 80 percent of industry in Poland, including
steel mills, coal mines and factories. None of the 7,600 state
enterprises would be off-limits to privatization, officials said.
   All citizens will be given ``privatization bonds'' that can be
redeemed for company stocks, allowing the estimated 65 percent of
Polish families with no savings to become shareholders.
   The Sejm, or the lower house of parliament, passed the
legislation 328-2, with 39 abstentions. The vote came one day after
the long-delayed bill reached the floor.
   A separate bill creating a ministry to oversee the changes
passed 266-0 with 22 abstentions.
   The legislation must still be ratified by the Senate on July 19,
but with 99 of 100 senators elected from the non-Communist
Solidarity movement, it was not expected to encounter any
difficulty.
   ``This is a foundation of the new economic system in Poland,''
Balcerowicz said after the vote.
   The Finance Ministry official in charge of privatization,
Krzysztof Lis, said there would be problems putting the bill into
practice, such as assembling the new ministry and creating a stock
market.
   But, ``wide consensus has been created for privatization, and
this is the most important thing,'' Lis said.
   Before introducing the vote on Thursday, Balcerowicz said the
``ownership changes must be completed more quickly than in any
country that has attempted it before us.''
   Companies in the best financial shape would be sold first. Those
judged unsalvageable will be liquidated and their assets sold off.
   Still, officials estimated that only a dozen major factories
would be privatized in the first year, and even after three years
fewer than half would be in private hands.
   Meanwhile, selling or leasing state stores, boutiques,
restaurants and services to individuals _ so-called ``small
privatization'' _ is already under way and is expected to be
completed by late 1991.
   Hungary and Czechoslovakia are moving toward selling off their
state industries.
   In Hungary, the new centrist government has sold some
enterprises but is taking a cautious approach, hoping to minimize
the negative consequences such as unemployment and higher prices.
   In Czechoslovakia, the government intends to issue coupons this
fall that would allow workers to buy their own companies. The main
privatization laws are expected next year.
   Poland, whose Communist regime was replaced by the Solidarity
government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in August, in
January embarked on a radical economic reform program. The first
goal was to stabilize runaway inflation.
   The program whittled inflation down to 3.4 percent in June,
compared with 600 percent to 1,000 percent inflation in 1989. But
the social cost has been high _ real incomes have dropped by 30
percent.
   But the privatization measure was stalled for months because of
disputes over how to proceed. Many people feared privatization
would benefit only foreign investors or the former Communist elite,
who alone would have capital to buy state property.
   But the government promised to issue all citizens
``privatization bonds,'' which can be used toward the purchase of
state-owned property.
   It also promised citizens would be allowed to buy shares on an
installment basis and, in some cases, on favorable credit terms.
   ``In this way, the idea of citizen's stock ownership will be put
into practice,'' Balcerowicz said.
   In a nod to workers, who under Communist rule came to think of
factories as their property, employees can buy up to 20 percent of
shares in their own companies on preferential terms.
   Foreign investment will be at the discretion of the minister
responsible for privatization, officials said.
   The first step in the process will be to convert all state-owned
enterprises into joint-stock companies owned in full by the state
Treasury, they said.

<HEAD>Bill Would Cut European Troop Strength, Star Wars Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Armed Services Committee approved a
$289 billion defense bill Friday that would cut U.S. troop strength
in Europe and reduce President Bush's 1991 budget request for Star
Wars.
   The panel, responding to the lessening Soviet threat overseas
and economic demands at home, unanimously agreed to slash $18
billion from Bush's proposal of $307 billion in military spending
for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   ``This is the most sweeping degree of change we've seen in a
defense bill that I've had anything to do with since I've been in
the Senate,'' committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said in
announcing completion of the legislation.
   Among the decisions reached in an all-night, closed session that
ended early Friday was approval of the administration's request for
the B-2 stealth bomber, a significant cut in the MX rail-garrison
nuclear missile program and a delay in production of the C-17
transport plane.
   But the surprise was the committee's action on the issue of the
nation's 2.1 million men and women in uniform.
   The panel, by a vote of 15-5, approved reducing the level of
311,855 troops stationed in Europe to 261,855, a cut of 50,000 by
Sept. 30, 1991.
   In negotiations with the Soviet Union on reducing conventional
forces in Europe, Bush has proposed cutting the number of U.S.
troops to 225,000 _ 195,000 in the central front and 30,000
elsewhere in Europe. The reductions would be achieved within the
time frame of a conventional forces treaty, but negotiations
between the two superpowers have stalled.
   The committee also included a provision that would allow Bush to
refuse to reduce troops in Europe if he believes the cut isn't in
the nation's security interests.
   The panel approved a total personnel cut of 100,000, more than
three times the 38,000 the Pentagon proposed for 1991, and set a
fiscal 1995 target of 1.6 military personnel, a reduction of nearly
475,000 from current levels.
   Faced with increasing demands on the money usually earmarked for
defense, the committee cut $972 million from the administration's
request of $4.7 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative,
commonly known as Star Wars.
   Last year, Congress approved the first reduction in the program
since President Reagan introduced the anti-missile shield seven
years ago.
   Amendments to change the SDI figure are certain once the bill
reaches the full Senate just before the August recess, lawmakers
said.
   ``Even if it's technically feasible ... no one has a chart
showing how you pay for it,'' Nunn said about Star Wars.
   Responding to recent signals from the Air Force that the B-2
stealth bomber is its top priority, the committee approved the
Pentagon's revised proposal for two of the radar-evading aircraft
in fiscal 1991.
   But clashes over the bomber, now estimated at a cost of $860
million apiece, are expected on the Senate floor.
   While approving the B-2 money, the committee slashed more than
$1.6 billion from a plan to move MX land-based, nuclear missiles
from fixed silos to railroad cars.
   The panel earmarked only $548 million in research and
development money for the program and $202 million for the
single-warhead Midgetman missile.
   A floor battle also is expected over the committee's decision to
kill the Milstar program by eliminating the administration's budget
request of $1.3 billion. The Air Force program of a communications
satellite was to be the U.S. command and control system for a
nuclear war.
   The committee also:
   _Deferred procurement of the C-17 transport plane because of
development and testing delays, for a savings of $1.8 billion.
   _Trimmed $150 million from the more than $400 million request
for the LH helicopter and directed the Army to postpone full-scale
development and fly a prototype first.
   _Eliminated procurement funds for the A-12 aircraft for a
savings of $1.5 billion.
   _Approved $238 million in research and development money for the
V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft Bush proposed canceling.
   _Deleted all new funds for chemical weapons production.
   _Killed an Energy Department request for $65 million to build a
new plutonium facility at Rocky Flats, Colo.

   The head of NASA's investigation of the Hubble
Space Telescope's blurred vision said Friday it may take more than
six months to pinpoint the error but that the probe should reveal
what went wrong and who was responsible.
   Dr. Lew Allen, chairman of the NASA review panel, told a House
panel the results of the investigation could prove ``very
embarrassing'' to those responsible for the flaw.
   ``We are confident we have the ability to find the error'' and
determine responsibility, he said.
   Allen, making his first congressional appearance since the probe
began, testified before the House Committee on Science, Space and
Technology.
   The most likely problem, Allen said, is an error in the
curvature of the telescope's primary 94-inch mirror that makes it
impossible to properly focus the $1.5 billion observatory.
   The margin of error is microscopic to the human eye, but enough
to make the telescope's vision no better than quality observatories
on the ground. The mistake makes it impossible to focus light from
all parts of the mirror onto one point.
   Dr. Lennard A. Fisk, a NASA associate administrator, said the
focus problem will be corrected for the main Hubble camera in 1993
when a replacement camera is flown up to the telescope by the space
shuttle and spacewalking astronauts switch instruments.
   But that mission will correct the focus for only one of the five
instruments on board Hubble. Other corrections will have to wait
until 1996 and later.
   ``The error is very large,'' said Fisk. ``Therefore some simple,
low-cost, no-risk test could have been done that could have
detected the flaw.''
   Asked why such tests before the telescope was assemble were not
performed, Fisk said, ``We're asking those same questions.''
   Allen said the instrument used to measure the mirrors when they
were constructed nearly a decade ago _ a null corrector _ has been
``untouched since it was used'' and was impounded by the review
panel.
   ``If there was an error in the corrector it would cause the
primary (mirror) to be configured wrong,'' he said.
   Committee Chairman Robert A. Roe, D-N.J., said Allen's probe
could be too narrow and not lead to broad changes in the way NASA
manages complicated programs and tests complex equipment.
   But Fisk, the chief scientist for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, said, ``If we stop at the findings of Dr.
Allen's panel, then we will not have done our job. We won't stop at
that.''
   Fisk said he would determine if any management changes should be
made and would agree to having another panel of outside experts
examine the agency's management system, but only after Allen's
review panel concluded its work.
   Allen said the null corrector that measured the primary mirror
also was used to measure a 60-inch demonstration mirror for the
telescope project. That allows investigators to test the measuring
instrument to see whether the corrector caused the problem.
   But all of these tests will be time-consuming, Allen said, and
he told the committee the probe will take ``perhaps six months or
more.''
   ``We know the most likely outcome from our investigation,'' he
said, will be findings that are ``very embarrassing to someone or
some group.''
   Members peppered Fisk with questions on why the mirrors weren't
tested after the entire telescope was built.
   Although Fisk cited technical reasons for the decision, NASA
officials had said in earlier statements that such testing would
have required up to $300 million and the construction of a special
facility.
   The testing, Fisk said, would have been ``extremely complicated.
It was questionable whether it would yield the information we
wanted. And it ran serious risk of contaminating'' the mirrors for
measuring ultra violet rays _ a function that was not affected by
the focus flaw.

   Yeltsin, the maverick populist of Soviet politics, stunned
thousands of delegates to a Communist Party congress Thursday by
announcing he was quitting the party. It was a sharp blow to the

   Nassau County must pay a $180,000 fine for
failing to meet deadlines for ending ocean dumping of sludge, the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday.
   The county, under a court agreement, had been required to award
two sets of contracts by May 15 _ one to acquire sludge dewatering
equipment and a second to build sludge dewatering facilities.
   Failure to award the contracts triggered penalties that
accumulated at a rate of $2,000 a day from May 15 through June 13,
then $10,000 a day from June 14 through June 25, the EPA said.
Nassau has paid the $180,000 into an escrow account.
   Had the county begun building its sludge dewatering plant by
June 30, the penalties would have been forgiven.
   EPA Regional Administrator Constantine Sidamon-Eristoff said the
penalties will continue building and will reach $420,000 on July 25.
   Nassau is one of nine areas in New York and New Jersey that dump
more than 8 million tons of sewage yearly into an Atlantic Ocean
site 115 miles off New Jersey. The eight other authorities are on
or close to schedule for ending their ocean dumping, the EPA said.

   It was 64 years late and not quite as billed,
but New Orleans finally made good on a promise to a 13-year-old boy.
   Louis May, now 77, tied with a girl named Leola Molbrough in
1926 for first place in an essay contest about why the city needed
an air field. A $20 gold piece had been designated for winner.
Mayor Arthur O'Keefe said that, out of gallantry, the gold piece
would go to the young lady and a duplicate gold piece would be
awarded to May.
   May never got it, and probably never will. But on Thursday,
acting Mayor Dorothy Mae Taylor presented May with a certificate of
merit from the City Council and a gold-sealed paper proclaiming
July 12, 1990, as Louis May Day.
   Taylor said she was bent on recognizing May after reading a July
6 story about him and his never-awarded prize in The Times-Picayune.
   She apologized for not giving May the $20 gold piece. ``But with
the financial constraints of the city, it just wasn't possible,''
she said.

   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley responded
sharply Friday to Republican official Ed Rollins' attempt to blame
Democrats for the savings and loan mess, calling him a panicked,
``out of control person.''
   Rollins, chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign
Committee, told the Republican National Committee in Chicago a day
earlier, ``Democrats sold out the taxpayers.'' He urged the party
to get on the offensive about the S&amp;L disaster, which could cost
American taxpayers $300 billion or more by some estimates.
   Foley, D-Wash., called the remarks ``Mr. Rollins' emotional
ravings'' and added, ``It sounded like he was in a panic. ... It
was sort of a running doggerel of political invective.''
   He said Rollins had made ``a wild statement'' and ``unrestrained
and totally raw partisan accusation.''
   Foley's strong words were in contrast to his normally reserved
demeanor.
   He noted that Rollins' million-dollar contract with the party to
head its congressional campaign committee has been controversial
among Republicans. He said Rollins demonstrated he was ``sort of an
out of control person'' by earlier statements that he would
continue to attack Democratic congressmen on taxes even though
President Bush has called for a tax increase to reduce the budget
deficit.
   ``The fact is, he's a political operative, a hired gun,'' Foley
said. ``He's there to spread whatever mischief he can.''
   ``Certainly he's not the most composed, rational and fair minded
man in town in either party,'' he said.
   Rollins, in his remarks in Chicago, said he was responding to
Democratic attacks concerning the S&amp;L situation and frequent
mention of Bush's son Neil who is under investigation for his role
as a director of the failed Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan in
Denver.
   Rollins said Democrats in Congress resisted early Reagan and
Bush administration efforts to clean up the troubled industry
because of the financial support they were getting from S&amp;L
interests.
   Foley, in his response, said he could think of no attack by
Democrats on the issue that compared in partisanship to Rollins's
remarks.

<TEXT>
   One successful military invasion deserves
another, or so say officials planning a second ``attack'' on Panama
to celebrate McChord Air Force Base's 50th anniversary.
   The highlight of Saturday's day-long show of military might is a
re-enactment of the December invasion. The event is billed as a
``joint services air power demonstration,'' complete with
explosions and strafing runs, paratroopers dropping from the sky
and planes zooming in from overhead.
   ``We in this office never intended to call it the Panama
re-enactment, but a lot of the planes and (some troops) that are
jumping did actually participate in the real invasion,'' said Maj.
Art Dearing, an anniversary coordinator.
   ``It's the same general attack scenario we used in World War II,
in Vietnam, in Panama and in Grenada,'' Dearing said Friday.
   Still, an earlier press release promised ``the most spectacular
event'' of anniversary celebrations would be a ``re-enactment of
the invasion of Panama, with the actual aircraft, aircrews and
soldiers who were there participating!''
   The action at the base south of Tacoma begins with a simulated
bomb run by an A-10 Thunderbolt, followed by a fake strafing run by
a Canadian Air Force CT-33. Charges will be planted in the ground
for the explosions, Dearing said.
   After the area is cleared of the ``enemy,'' an Air Force combat
controller team will jump from 6,000 feet but not open their
parachutes until 1,000 feet above the ground.
   That will be followed by more simulated bombing and a drop of
simulated heavy equipment and ammunition and more control team
members.
   The finale is when C-141 transports drop 150 Army Rangers from
nearby Fort Lewis onto the field. The Rangers belong to a unit that
went to Panama, where they jumped from only 500 feet in seizing the
Rio Hato military airfield, Dearing said.
   But there will be some major differences between ``Panama II''
and the original. No one will be standing in for Gen. Manuel
Noriega, who as a result of the real attack is in custody in
Florida on drug-smuggling charges.
   Nor will the ``attackers'' be shielded by the cloak of night
from the enemy. The event begins in mid-afternoon. There won't be
an enemy, either, just onlookers on what is expected to be a clear,
sunny day.
   The base expects around 100,000 people to attend the simulated
attack, Dearing said.
   ``I would say the controversy over Panama or Panama II has
increased interest,'' he said. ``And it's free.''
   About 625 Rangers from Fort Lewis flew out of McChord to
participate in the real thing. Two were killed and 36 injured in
the Dec. 20 pre-dawn assault and subsequent action.

   A leading dissident under house arrest
since last July will not be released next week as scheduled, the
military indicated Friday, and warned her party not to try to
declare a government despite its landslide election victory.
   Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt, head of military intelligence, said the
junta would not yield to international pressure for the release of
Aung San Suu Kyi and a transfer of power to her National League for
Democracy.
   Suu Kyi, the charismatic daughter of Burma's foremost
independence hero, was placed under house arrest July 20, 1989, for
one year. The junta said then that the sentence could be renewed.
   Khin Nyunt said Suu Kyi would be allowed to hold a religious
ceremony at her home on July 19, indicating she would remain in
detention the day her intial sentence is to expire.
   July 19 is Martyrs Day, the 43rd anniversary of the
assassination of Suu Kyi's father, Aung San. The junta detained Suu
Kyi after she said she would lead an anti-government rally to
commemorate her father's death.
   She has never been formally charged.
   The pressure to release her and threat of economic sanctions
amounted to ``undue interference in the internal affairs of our
country,'' Khin Nyunt said.
   ``We do not care at all about such threats,'' he said.
   In the election, the National League trounced the main
pro-military party, winning 396 of 485 parliamentary seats. But the
junta has said the National League must approve a constitution
before it can govern.
   ``The (junta) is a military government ruling the country under
martial law. No attempt for a unilateral declaration of government
will be tolerated,'' Khin Nyunt said.
   The junta suspended the constitution when it seized power by
brutally crushing a national uprising for democracy in 1988.
   In the past, it has said the new parliament could choose between
two previous constitutions or draw up a new one.
   The National League has said it wishes to adapt the constitution
of 1947. That constitution was adopted when Burma gained
independence from Britain a year later.
   But Khin Nyunt said ``both the 1947 and 1974 constitutions are
no longer adaptable to the country's present situation.''
   ``Hence an entirely new constitution which would not entail
legal problems arising out of its shortcomings must be drawn,'' he
said.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon say the insistence on the
constitution is a ploy to cling to power.
   Khin Nyunt said the junta would hold talks with political
leaders only when all election expenses and objections had been
cleared by the Elections Commission.
   He said Suu Kyi was being detained ``according to the law,'' and
that she had been treated leniently.
   ``Though she is restricted to her home, all facilities are being
provided for,'' he said. She has been allowed to receive parcels
from her British husband through the British Embassy, Khin Nyunt
said.

<HEAD>Bush Encouraged About Chances of Civil Rights Bill Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Friday chances of reaching
a compromise with Democrats on legislation to combat job bias look
encouraging and his optimism was echoed by sponsors of the bill.
   ``As I leave here for the weekend, I hope I'm right in saying it
looks like we can work something out on that,'' Bush said as he
boarded a helicopter for his Camp David, Md., retreat.
   Sponsors say the measure is needed to redress setbacks handed to
the civil rights movement by the increasingly conservative Supreme
Court.
   But the bill has drawn fire from the business community for a
provision that would make employers end disparate, or lopsided,
hiring practices or prove in court that they were justified by
business necessity.
   Much of the negotiations have focused on the definition of the
``business necessity'' that would be required.
   Business critics and the Bush administration say the provision
would prompt companies to hire on the basis of minority quotas to
insulate themselves from lawsuits.
   Bush's comments came as reports swept Capitol Hill that White
House chief of staff John Sununu and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., had reached agreement in weeklong bargaining over terms of
a bill to combat job discrimination.
   Kennedy stopped short of confirming a deal existed but said he
expected one next week. Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said unless a compromise materialized by Tuesday he would
try to cut short debate and push the bill through over White House
objections.
   Some conservative Republicans remained cool to the latest
proposals, according to sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a leading critic, said again
Friday the bill would amount to ``a bonanza for litigators'' and
said it would have to be modified considerably.
   Provisions range from a ban on racial harassment on the job to a
process for imposing punitive damages in discrimination cases _ a
feature business dislikes.
   Bush stopped to take a few questions on his way to the
helicopter en route to Camp David.
   He said that ``Sununu was back today and had a fairly, I would
say, reasonably optimistic proposal.''
   ``My position on that one remains clear,'' Bush said. ``I want
to sign a civil rights bill. I will not sign a quota bill. And
that's about where we are, but I think it's looking encouraging.''
   Bush said he ``saw Ted Kennedy down here yesterday and had a
chance to share my views with him once again.''
   ``And he's been working, I would say, quite cooperatively with
us, the Republican side,'' Bush said.
   Kennedy told a news conference he believed ``we can successfully
conclude an agreement next week. ... Because of the involvement of
the administration and bipartisan efforts, substantial movement has
been achieved. We're dramatically closer.''

   Here are key provisions of the Americans with
Disabilities Act, which President Bush is expected to sign as soon
as next week:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFINITION:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Any physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a
``major life activity'' _ caring for oneself, performing manual
tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning and
working. Anyone perceived as having a disability is covered _ a
person with AIDS, for example. But AIDS is also covered because of
federal court decisions dealing with the disability provisions in
fair housing laws and laws governing recipients of federal money.
People with the history of a disability _ a former cancer patient
or former illegal drug use, for example _ are also covered.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EXCLUSIONS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Current users of illegal drugs. Homosexuals, bisexuals,
transsexuals, transvestites. Pedophiles, exhibitionists, voyeurs
and those with other sexual behavior disorders. Compulsive
gamblers, kleptomaniacs, pyromaniacs. Anyone with a mental disorder
resulting from current illegal use of drugs.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EMPLOYMENT:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   After two years, all businesses with 25 or more workers are
covered. Coverage expands after two additional years to all
businesses with 15 or more workers. Employers may not reject
applicants or fire current employees on the basis of disability.
Businesses must modify or buy equipment or devices or provide
helpers _ such as readers for blind workers _ to help the worker
overcome the particular disability. Businesses are exempt if the
accommodations create an undue financial hardship, which is
determined case by case. Victims may seek back pay, reinstatement
and attorneys' fees.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Public accommodations must be made accessible to disabled
patrons 18 months after the bill takes effect. Such public
accommodations include hotels, restaurants, theaters, auditoriums,
convention centers, doctors' offices, pharmacists, retail stores,
public transportation terminals, museums, libraries, parks, zoos
and recreation centers. Businesses with 25 or fewer employees and
gross receipts of $1 million or less have six additional months to
comply; those with 10 or fewer employees and gross receipts of
$500,000 an additional year. All new facilities must be made
accessible.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TRANSPORTATION:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   All new buses, rapid rail vehicles or light rail vehicles used
in public transit must be wheelchair accessible. Existing vehicles
need not be refitted, but key stations and all new stations must be
made accessible within three years. All new cars for Amtrak and
commuter rail systems must be made accessible. One car per train
must be made accessible within five years. Privately owned
intercity bus companies would have to acquire accessible buses
within six or seven years, depending on the size of the company.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TELECOMMUNICATIONS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   All telephone companies must provide relay services for
hearing-and speech-impaired customers with three years.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FOOD HANDLERS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Employers could reassign employees with certain communicable or
contagious diseases from food-handling duties. However, employers
could only reassign workers with diseases the Department of Health
and Human Services determines can be spread through contact with
food. The provision was adopted after an unsuccessful attempt to
make it possible for AIDS-infected workers to be reassigned. The
government says AIDS is not spread through contact with food.

<HEAD>Dance Group Sues NEA Over Obscenity Certification Requirement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dance group is suing the National Endowment
for the Arts' because of its requirement that grant recipients
promise not to create obscene works.
   The Bella Lewitzky Dance Foundation filed a lawsuit in U.S.
District Court on Thursday claiming the restriction is
unconstitutional.
   In May, the New School for Social Research filed a similar
lawsuit in New York.
   ``The NEA has now taken on the role of art censor. And that's
precisely the wrong role for goverment,'' choreographer Bella
Lewitzky said in a statement.
   Lewitzky last month rejected a $72,000 NEA grant, which would
have accounted for about 8.5 percent of the 12-member modern dance
troupe's budget, said spokesman Allen Wallace.
   In New York, a hearing has been scheduled July 31 for the New
School's challenge, which questions the constitutionality of
loyalty oaths.
   The school is a parent of the Otis-Parsons Art Institute.
   The NEA declined comment on the latest lawsuit.
   The uproar over funding erupted in Congress last year after
conservative groups protested federal support of art shows
containing photographs they considered obscene.
   In the 1990 funding bill for the NEA and the National Endowment
of the Humanities, Congress banned support for work judged obscene
that did not meet high artistic or scholarly standards.
   The NEA responded to the bill's provision by requiring grant
recipients to sign a statement promising not to create obscene
works.
   Of more than 2,000 grant offers sent out requiring the
statement, about 700 have been returned, the NEA said Thursday.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Orders Reconsideration in NYNEX Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ordered a district
judge on Friday to reconsider his denial of a request by NYNEX
Corp. that it be allowed to distribute telecommunications equipment
to other companies.
   The ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia marks another turning point in the
battle by the seven regional Bell telephone companies to escape
restrictions placed on them in the 1984 breakup of the old Bell
System.
   The appeals court said U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, who
continues to oversee the consent decree that effected the Bell
breakup, failed to properly address the competitive issues raised
by New York-based NYNEX's possible entry into the
telecommunications distribution business.
   The 1982 consent decree under which NYNEX and the other regional
Bell companies were created prohibited them from engaging in the
long-distance, equipment manufacturing and distribution businesses,
among other restrictions.
   NYNEX in 1985 asked Greene for a waiver to allow its wholly
owned purchasing unit, NYNEX Materiel Enterprises Co., to
distribute telecommunications products to customers unaffiliated
with NYNEX. Greene denied the request.
   NYNEX appealed to the higher court. American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., along with a host of other telecommunications
equipment manufacturers, filed briefs with the appeals court
arguing against NYNEX.
   The appeals court Friday left little doubt that it looked
favorably on NYNEX's waiver request.
   ``Under our reading of the decree, which differed in some
important particulars from that of the district court, it may well
be that NYNEX is entitled to the relief it seeks in this case,''
Circuit Judge Laurence H. Silberman wrote.
   The basis of the consent decree restrictions is the fear that
the Bell companies may use their positions as monopoly local phone
service providers to impede competition or that they may make their
captive local phone customers foot the bill for new ventures.
   The appeals court said it saw ``significant merit'' in NYNEX's
argument that since thousands of companies are competing in the
telecommunications distribution market that its entry therefore
would be ``competitively benign.''
   NYNEX this year has been hit with a federal indictment for
allegedly violating the consent decree's restrictions on providing
computerized information services. The Federal Communications
Commission also fined NYNEX a record $1.4 million for allegedly
overcharging customers through its Materiel Enterprises division.
NYNEX has denied any wrongdoing.
   The Wall Street Journal reported this week that NYNEX also is
being investigated for allegations that suppliers for NYNEX's New
York Telephone helped pay for bawdy parties and prostitutes at
annual conventions involving Materiel Enterprises employees.
   Greene previously has lifted some of the restrictions on the
Bells' provision of information services and non-telecommunications
products and services, but he has refused to ease other
line-of-business restrictions.
   The Bell companies currently are waging an intense campaign in
Congress to get some of the remaining restrictions eliminated.
   The Senate could vote on lifting the manufacturing restrictions
this year.

   Hold the anchovies, and the delivery man.
   Tenants of a Lawrence trailer park have been told to head for a
restaurant, not a telephone, if they want a pizza.
   Wayne Lacy, manager of Brookwood Mobile Home Community, has
banned pizza deliveries because he says pizza truck drivers go too
fast through the park.
   Residents were told this week that they would get a warning for
the first delivery and their leases would be terminated after the
second.
   Lacy said residents have been complaining about speeding pizza
trucks for two years.
   ``I'm through with it,'' Lacy said. ``I've had too many cussings
from drivers, too many complaints from the tenants. There just
won't be any more pizza deliveries.''
   Mark Pitner, a counselor with Consumer Affairs Association, said
some Brookwood residents have complained about the ban. But the ban
appears to be legal because leases at the park carry a 30-day limit.
   ``Because it's a month-to-month lease, and all he's doing is
terminating the lease and not evicting residents. He can do that,''
Pitner said. ``That's something we'd like to see changed in the
Kansas Landlord-Tenant Act, but it's legal.''
   About 200 of Brookwood 265 units are occupied.

<TEXT>
   Chances of settling the 12-year war in
Afghanistan have slipped because the Soviet Union has not come
through on its promise of new proposals on the future of President
Najibullah, the Bush administration said Friday.
   The issue is the main sticking point in peace negotiations.
Otherwise, the United States and the Soviets are in basic agreement
to hold elections and take other steps to end fighting between
Najibullah's forces and Moslem guerrillas.
   The Soviets, who had troops in Afghanistan from December 1979
until February 1989, are reluctant to undercut Najibullah; the Bush
administration supports the guerrillas in trying to get him to
yield power promptly while elections are held to form a new
government.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze agreed last month in a meeting in
Berlin to try to work out a compromise solution.
   The Soviets were supposed to send experts on Afghanistan to
Washington for talks before Baker's meeting next week in Paris with
Shevardnadze.
   But the Kremlin did not send the experts here, and Baker leaves
on Monday for the French capital.
   U.S. officials said the Soviets, their senior policy-makers
preoccupied with the 28th Communist Party Congress, apparently had
not decided what to do about Najibulah.
   ``They'll be turning their attention back to those kinds of
issues now,'' said a senior U.S. official, who demanded anonymity.
   He said Baker would try to get an answer from Shevardnadze at
their meeting next week.
   The main purpose of Baker's trip to Paris is to hold talks on
German unification with Shevardnadze and the foreign ministers of
Britain, France, West Germany, East Germany and Poland.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev failed
to resolve major differences over Afghanistan at their summit
meeting in Washington in early June.
   But the two sides made headway since then. Baker told the House
Foreign Affairs Committee on June 14 that ``the one thing'' that
continues to separate them is whether Najibullah would preside over
the government in Kabul during a transition period that would
include elections.
   The Bush administration argues that elections held while
Najibullah is still in charge would not be accepted by the Afghan
people.
   During the final years of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan,
U.S. officials expressed confidence that Najibullah and the Afghan
army would collapse once the Red Army departed.
   That forecast turned out to be way off the mark. The Soviets
left massive arsenals behind and are providing $4 billion in
military aid and $1 billion in economic aid.
   Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, senior military adviser to Gorbachev,
said during the summit that the United States now fully understood
that Najibullah would not be defeated militarily.
   Last February, Baker persuaded the Soviets to agree that
elections should be part of an overall settlement to the war in
Afghanistan.

   Gov. Buddy Roemer said Friday he will
not sign the nation's strictest state anti-abortion bill, but may
allow it to become law without his signature.
   A state official, meanwhile, said the bill would even outlaw IUD
birth control devices.
   ``I've gone from three options to two. I will either veto the
bill or allow it to become law without my signature,'' Roemer said
in a statement.
   He has until July 29 to decide whether to veto it.
   Roemer said that although the bill provides exceptions for
pregnancies resulting from rape and incest, he was not happy with
provisions of the legislation and the way the Legislature passed it
during the closing days of its session.
   Roemer, who originally requested a 30-day period in which a
woman would be allowed to report a rape and have an abortion later,
said he was not happy with the bill's seven-day provision.
   He also said he believed the bill did not do enough to protect a
woman's mental health.
   ``It's an issue that gives me great concern,'' he said. ``It's
part of the discussion of how complex this is. At the very minimum,
the mother's physical health has to be taken care of. Mental health
of the mother is a legitimate point of discussion and has always
been a concern to me.''
   The bill calls for up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to
$100,000 for doctors who perform abortions.
   Roemer vetoed a measure that allowed exceptions only to protect
the life of a mother. The Legislature hastily assembled and passed
the measure that Roemer now says he won't sign.
   The governor, pro-choice advocates and some lawmakers have
expressed doubts whether the bill would pass court muster. The
measure sent to Roemer originally was a bill calling for a maximum
$25 fine for people who assault flag burners. The Senate stripped
of those provisions and amended it into an anti-abortion bill.
   Louisiana Attorney General William Guste said Thursday he sees
nothing wrong with the anti-abortion measure.
   ``If in fact there were any procedural irregularities, which we
do not concede, then these were certainly cured by the adoption of
the bill by more than a two-thirds majority in each house,'' he
said.
   An assistant state attorney general, Jennifer Schaye, said the
bill would prohibit the use of intrauterine devices, or IUDs. The
metal or plastic devices are implanted by a physician in the uterus
to prevent a fertilized egg from attaching itself to the uterine
wall.
   Guste agreed, saying: ``Technically, this would be a violation
because the premise is that life begins at conception and the law
says any instrument or device used on a female constitutes the
simple battery of abortion.''

<HEAD>House Votes to Freeze Office Expenses of Former Presidents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Friday to freeze spending on
office expenses of former presidents amid complaints they are
millionaires who already receive generous pensions.
   ``With this government tottering on the financial brink of
disaster, taxpayers in this country might wonder about the sanity
of forcing them to give a half a million dollars each to four
wealthy men who are already collecting $107,000 each in pensions,''
said Rep. Andy Jacobs, D-Ind.
   The action came on amendments to a $20.7 billion appropriations
bill for fiscal 1991 spending by the Treasury Department, Postal
Service, the office of the president and independent agencies.
   The bill provides new authority for the U.S. Secret Service to
join the FBI in investigating savings-and-loan fraud.
   It authorizes 300 new Secret Service agents _ a 50 percent
increase for the agency _ to join the 600 FBI agents at work in the
S&amp;L scandals.
   The Secret Service, while known for protecting the president,
has long been responsible for investigating counterfeiting and
securities, credit card and computer fraud.
   The bill, approved on a 300-72 vote, goes to the Senate.
   Jacobs, a frequent critic of taxpayer spending on former
presidents, tried to amend the bill by slashing all office expenses
for former presidents, totaling nearly $1.6 million.
   But the House voted 300-91 to amend Jacobs' amendment so that it
freezes the office expenditure at 1990 levels. That represents a
cut of 8 percent, $156,000, in the total spending on former
presidents, including their $107,300 a year pensions.
   Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan
receive pensions and benefits.
   Rep. Edward R. Roybal, D-Calif., floor manager for the
appropriations bill, opposed Jacobs' attempt to slash the
presidential spending but supported the freeze.
   It ``sends a message we're looking at this thing very
carefully,'' he said. ``They should be prudent in the expenditure
of funds.''
   The bill contains other provisions that send that message, too.
   It orders the Treasury Department to report to Congress on how
to reduce federal spending on travel by former presidents and their
spouses when they are being paid to give speeches, including
whether the government should seek reimbursement. It authorizes the
Secret Service to accept private contributions to offset the cost
of protecting former presidents when they make paid appearances or
speeches _ something it can't accept now.
   The action came among expressions of dismay over payments to
former presidents while they use their status to rake in large
amounts of money.
   Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said some former presidents ``look
more like retired royalty than retired presidents.''
   ``We've got plenty of needs for money that we don't have to pile
extra benefits on top of benefits her for people that don't need
them,'' he said.
   The bill's overall spending amounts to an increase of $2.3
billion over 1990 levels and $7.8 million over what President Bush
sought in his budget proposal.

   Twelve North-Korean flagged, Japanese-owned fishing
vessels and their crewmen left a Soviet port Friday where they had
been held for two months for poaching Soviet salmon, the Foreign
Ministry said Friday.
   The Soviets released the boats after demanding North Korea take
measures to prevent future fishing violations, the Japanese Foreign
Ministry said.
   The boats were heading toward the North Korean port of Hungnam,
where they would be examined by Soviet inspectors to determine how
much compensation the North Koreans would have to pay for the
illegal fishing.
   Tass said North Korea guaranteed payment of $3 million in bail,
pending discussion of the incident.
   In Moscow, the official Soviet news agency Tass said the ship's
captains estimated their ships were carrying 500 tons of fish,
worth about $8 million.
   The ships have North Korean officers, but about three-quarters
of their crews are Japanese. The Kyodo News Service reported in
late May that 10 North Korean ships were seized May 19-22, with 202
crew members _ 140 of whom were Japanese.
   The Japanese fishermen had been held since mid-May by the
Soviets on Shikotan, a small island in the Kurile chain just off
the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.
   It is unclear when the vessels will be allowed to sail for Japan.
   Japan's consul general in the Soviet port of Nakhodka strongly
protested that the vessels were headed for North Korea and not
Japan.
   The foreign ministry had said earlier crewmen were afraid of
going to North Korea and wanted to return directly to Japan.
Japanese coast guard vessels were dispatched to the area to try to
monitor the voyage.
   Acting foreign ministry spokesman Shigeo Takenaka said North
Korea promised to return the 169 Japanese fishermen ``without
delay'' after they arrived in Hungnam.
   The seizure of the boats led to an unusual tug-of-war between
the Soviet Union, North Korea and Japan over fishing in salmon-rich
waters off the Soviet coast.
   It also accentuated tensions between Moscow and Communist North
Korea. Those ties have been strained by a recent thaw in Soviet
relations with pro-Western South Korea.
   Japan has a fishing agreement with the Soviet Union and there is
a quota of salmon Japanese vessels can take from Soviet waters.
   North Korea has no fishing quota agreement with the Soviet Union
but its fishing vessels were sometimes permitted to fish for salmon
in Soviet waters. Experts said the informal arrangement enticed
Japanese operators to put their vessels under the North Korean flag
and take more salmon than permitted under the Japan-Soviet
agreement.
   Japan and North Korea have no diplomatic relations and Japanese
authorities are examining the ties between Japanese and North
Korean fishing operations.
   Officials at one of the companies that leased boats to the North
Koreans said they were optimistic the vessels would soon return to
Japan.
   But a relative of Kazuo Yoshida, chief engineer aboard one of
the boats, said: ``I cannot help but remember the case of the
Fujisan Maru.''
   In 1983, two Japanese fishermen were arrested, tried for
espionage and sentenced to 15 years in prison in North Korea after
Japan permitted the defection of a North Korean who had stowed away
on their boat, the Fujisan Maru.

   The Census Bureau will count overseas military
personnel as residents of their homes of record rather than as
residents of their last duty station, a lawmaker said Friday.
   ``Wisconsin's population count will increase by approximately
12,000 under this new policy, and that's good news for my state,''
said Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., who chaired a hearing on the progress
of the 1990 census.
   ``It's also good news for many other states who wouldn't have
gotten a fair count under the previous policy,'' he said.
   The Defense Department has estimated there are between 600,000
and 700,000 active duty soldiers stationed oversees, according to a
committee staffer who spoke on condition he not be identified
further. That does not include dependents or civilian military
employees.
   The Census Bureau had planned to count overseas military and
civilian Defense Department personnel and their dependents as
residents of the last state in which they had lived for at least
six months.

<HEAD>FDA Considers Barring Recent Immigrants from Donating Blood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is
considering barring all new U.S. immigrants from giving blood for a
time after their arrival to further protect the nation's blood
supply from AIDS, an official said Friday.
   The ban is one of several proposals the FDA is considering to
replace a policy that prohibits blood donations indefinitely by
immigrants from Haiti or sub-Saharan Africa, which have high
AIDS-infection rates.
   Haitian and black African immigrants have criticized the current
policy as discriminatory because it singles them out. An FDA
advisory committee recently recommended the agency change the
policy.
   ``Our intent was never discrimination,'' said Paul Parkman,
director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.
   ``The advisory committee said we shouldn't use national origin
as a criteria, so one of the ways we can do that is not to single
out people from a geographic region, but (impose) a blanket
deferral,'' Parkman said.
   The proposal would be less restrictive than the current policy,
since Haitians and sub-Saharan Africans would be able to donate
blood after the deferral period.
   The length of a possible deferral period has not been
determined, but he said, ``we have kicked around a couple of
years.''
   It needs to be long enough to cover that period of time during
which a person infected with the AIDS virus still tests negative.
That window is believed to be about six months.

   Highlights of the 28th Communist Party congress,
which closed Friday after meeting for 11 days:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GORBACHEV VICTORIES: Mikhail S. Gorbachev was easily re-elected
party leader, succeeded in getting his protege, Vladimir Ivashko of
the Ukraine, elected as his deputy, and pushed through a proposal
to revamp and decentralize the party's Politburo to include as
members the first secretaries of the 15 Soviet republics.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BIGGEST LOSER: Yegor K. Ligachev, the traditionalist
standard-bearer and most-vocal Gorbachev critic on the Politburo,
was resoundingly defeated in his bid to become the deputy party
leader. He also lost his seat on the Politburo and Central
Committee. Ligachev, 69, said he plans to go back to his village in
Siberia and write a book.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CONSERVATIVE CRITICISM: Conservative delegates, led by Ligachev,
launched fierce attacks on Gorbachev throughout the congress and
accused his leadership of cowardice and indecision in the economy,
politics, the military and foreign policy. Yet, the speakers
themselves displayed no new ideas and no alternative to Gorbachev.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   REFORMERS WALK: Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin and members
of Democratic Platform, the party's reform bloc, announced in the
waning days of the congress that they were leaving the party. The
exodus shattered the unity among reformers that Gorbachev said is
necessary for the success of perestroika.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PUBLIC REACTION: Hundreds of thousands of anti-Communist coal
miners went on strike July 11, ignoring an appeal from the congress
to stay on the job. At two Moscow rallies, demonstrators shouted
for the end of communism, with a protester at one of the rallies
spitting at a delegate leaving Red Square. Muscovite Igor Smirnov
said on Day 3: ``I don't care about this congress. I'm sick of
hearing about it. They talk, talk, and there are no changes.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HIGH DRAMA: There were two dramatic moments: on Day 1, when coal
miner Vladimir Bludov stood up nine minutes into the congress and
called for the party leadership to resign; and on Day 10, when
Boris Yeltsin strode into the Palace of Congresses and stunned a
hushed crowd by saying he was quitting the party. The speech drew
derisive whistles and shouts of ``Shame!''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LIGHT MOMENT: On Day 9, a relaxed, smiling Gorbachev read out a
brief note congratulating delegate Anatoly D. Kravchenko on the
birth of his son. The Soviet leader then asked playfully: ``Are we
going to discuss what to call the son or not? And then vote on it?''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   KEY QUOTES:
   ``I think that in two years, if there are no changes, this
leadership must go.'' _ Mikhail S. Gorbachev, on Day 3 of the
congress, answering reporters' questions on what should happen if
there are no improvements in the lives of Soviet citizens.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``We are witnessing a congress of living corpses. The people are
afraid of many things, but the party is not one of them.'' _

interview with the independent Postfactum news agency on Day 8 of
the congress.

<HEAD>After Blaming an Exotic Islander, Dart Suspect Set for Psychiatric
Checkup</HEAD>

   The man charged with blowing darts at women in
skirts claimed innocence and said the real Dartman came from an
island where provocatively dressed women are tossed into volcanoes,
a prosecutor said Friday.
   Jerome Wright, 33, was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation
by Criminal Court Judge Harold B. Beeler after police at a hearing
disclosed the rambling, incoherent statement he made after being
arrested for the attacks.
   The evaluation will take place at Bellevue Hospital. Wright, who
did not enter a plea at the hearing, is due back in court Aug. 8.
   At least 55 women reported being attacked in midtown Manhattan
by a man who blew darts at their backsides. Not all the darts hit
their mark, and none of the women were seriously hurt.
   Wright was arraigned on two counts of criminal possession of a
weapon; two counts of reckless endangerment; and two counts of
harassment. He could face up to seven years in prison if convicted
on all charges.
   Wright told police the Dartman could be from an island where
they shoot darts at women ``who wear provocative and inappropriate
clothing.'' The women on this island, Wright said, without naming
the island, sometimes are thrown into volcanoes.
   Wright also told police that he'd experienced ``a great deal of
trouble with women in the past,'' including a girlfriend who dumped
him five years ago, said Assistant District Attorney Thomas Shields.
   Wright, a messenger and mail room clerk, made his comments to
police after he voluntarily arrived at a police precinct for a
lineup before Dartman victims, Shields said. He was arrested
Thursday.
   Wright, who has a history of psychiatric problems, detailed for
police his interest in women's legs, Shields said. All the
Dartman's victims were wearing skirts when they were stung with the
homemade darts, created with sewing needles or straight pins
wrapped in paper.
   Defense attorney Robert Wolf insisted his client was innocent.
   ``There's no physical evidence which connects Jerome Wright to
these crimes,'' said Wolf. ``He denies vehemently that he did
this.''
   ``His schedule permitted him to be in the areas where the events
took place,'' said Shields. The attacks began on June 26 and
continued into this week.
   He was charged in only two attacks, on July 2 and July 3. Police
said Thursday that most of the victims could not identify the
assailant because he struck from behind.
   Wright was on probation for a drug conviction at the time of his
arrest.

<HEAD>Bush Still Mum On Support For Specific Tax Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush kept mum Friday on where he
stands in the congressional negotiations over $25 billion in tax
hikes to help shrink the massive budget deficit.
   ``I see a lot of speculation and a lot of people saying what we
will or won't do or what they will or won't do _ Republicans and
Democrats, and look, I understand that,'' Bush said.
   However, the president said he has promised not to discuss
details of the budget negotiations while they are underway, and
that he would not violate that pledge.
   ``And at some point,'' Bush said, ``I may have to go out and
say, `Look, this is all we can do,' or `Here's where we go.' But
I'm not going to do that now.''
   Budget negotiators from the White House and Congress expect to
begin trading offers by early next week on about $25 billion in tax
increases for next year.
   Republicans could send Democrats the first package of proposed
tax hikes by Monday, sources said.
   One GOP negotiator said the plan probably will contain boosts in
excise taxes, perhaps on alcohol and tobacco products, as well as a
cut in the capital gains tax rate.
   It is unlikely to contain a boost in income tax rates, which
many Republicans have adamantly opposed, the official said.
   Negotiators are searching for at least $50 billion in spending
cuts and tax boosts for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, to shrink
a budget shortfall that will otherwise hit at least $160 billion.
   Bush spoke with reporters as he headed for his helicopter on the
White House South Lawn to go to Camp David for the weekend.
   He stopped to read a statement urging the House, in a vote on
Tuesday, to approve a constitutional amendment eventually requiring
a balanced budget.
   Bush said House passage of the measure would send ``a good
signal'' to the budget negotiators.
   He said the balanced budget amendment ``would halt the steady
buildup of the national debt. I think it will bring much-needed
discipline to the process _ discipline on the executive branch,
discipline on the legislative branch, on the Congress of the United
States.''

<HEAD>Rockport Residents Battle Smithsonian Over Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKPORT, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This seaside colony whose charms have
attracted many artists has found itself fighting a court battle
with the Smithsonian Institution over a bequest in a millionaire
sculptor's will.
   Franz Denghausen, the sculptor and poet who lived in Rockport
for 36 years, left $1 million town upon his death to replace the
town's small, turn-of-the-century Carnegie Library.
   But the Smithsonian, which also benefitted from Denghausen's
will, contends the money can only be used to operate the new
library, after the town uses its own money to build it.
   The existing one-story library building is overcrowded with
books, and lacks space for additional collections granted in memory
of Denghausen's wife, Luisita. So the town wants to use
Denghausen's bequest to convert a former elementary school into a
new library.
   The town library trustees contend the Smithsonian is attempting
to block the building of the library so it can obtain the town's $1
million. The Smithsonian already is expected to receive $4 million
to $5 million from the Denghausen estate. It also received $3.8
million from Luisita Denghausen's estate after she died on Jan. 19,
1986.
   The issue is now before an Essex County Probate Court.
Denghausen, who was childless, died Oct. 17, 1987.
   The Smithsonian and town library trustees disagree over the
interpretation of a passage from Denghausen's will that said the
money is intended ``for the purpose of providing an adequate
replacement for the now obsolete Carnegie Library.''
   The will said the money would be granted ``provided that the
town contribute the land upon which such a library is to be erected
or provide the funds for the renovation of some building now owned
by the town....''
   Residents at the December 1988 Town Meeting voted to give a
former elementary school land and building to the trustees for
conversion to a library. Residents also voted to spend $15,000 on
plans for the new library.
   Town officials said that without the $1 million from Denghausen,
the town cannot afford a new library.
   ``At this point, the Smithsonian is vigorously trying to prevent
the town of Rockport from being able to accept this gift,'' said
Ted Reed, chairman of the Rockport Library trustees.
   But Elaine Johnston, the institution's assistant general
counsel, defended the Smithsonian's action.
   ``The actions proposed by the town seem inconsistent with the
terms imposed by Mr. Denghausen, and the Smithsonian feels a
responsibility to ensure that his wishes are carried out,'' she
said.
   The state Attorney General's public charities division supports
the town.
   ``The overall purpose of the gift is to provide a replacement
for the now obsolete library, not for subsequent operating
expenses,'' the office of Attorney General James Shannon wrote.
   ``Frankly, we do not understand why the Smithsonian has chosen
to take such an adversarial position. It does not seem right that
such a large, federally supported, national institution is trying
to prevent a small town from upgrading its public library,'' said
Reed.
   The Smithsonian's annual budget is $225 million from the federal
government and $91 million from trust funds. The Rockport library's
annual budget is $147,000.

<HEAD>19th-Century Farmhouse to be Moved for Newspaper Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Preservationists are unhappy over plans by
Richmond Newspapers Inc. to dismantle and move a 19th-century
farmhouse that is standing in the way of the company's $195 million
production plant.
   ``If that decision is carried out, it will prove to be a very
unpopular one,'' said Robert B. Giles, an official with one of 12
Richmond-area historical groups battling the company over the
house's fate.
   RNI announced Thursday that Lockwood, the suburban Hanover
County farmhouse that was Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's field
headquarters for four days in 1864, will be dismantled and moved to
a new site 12 miles north.
   The house, built in the early 1800s, stands within 50 feet of
where RNI is building its new production plant.
   RNI and its parent company, Media General Inc., said the house
will be given to a Richmond couple who have signed an agreement to
reconstruct it.
   The estimated cost of the project is more than $50,000. RNI will
provide a grant up to $50,000 once the reconstruction begins, said
J. Stewart Bryan III, publisher of the Richmond Times-Dispatch and
The Richmond News Leader.
   ``This will ensure the continuity of a family owning and living
in this house,'' said Bryan, who also is chairman, president and
chief executive officer of Media General. ``We think its location
is the right location.''
   That's not satisfactory to Giles, vice president of the William
Byrd Branch of the Association for the Preservation of Virginia
Antiquities.
   ``As long as the house is still standing, we will carry on what
we envision to be our role to enlighten the public as to the
importance of the house,'' Giles said. ``It is a concern to a great
many people.''
   Lee stayed at the house recuperating from dysentery while
planning the Battle of Cold Harbor.
   Bryan said the heritage of the house, ``if in fact it has a
heritage, is not so much as a place where General Lee was sick for
four days, but its heritage is that of a country farm house. We are
much gratified that its future will also be just that _ a house
that will be lived in.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five prominent conservatives on Friday accused
President Bush of abandoning his conservative electoral base and
urged him to return to the fold lest he weaken the Republican party
and its candidates.
   If he doesn't, Bush will face an ``almost certain'' challenge
from a conservative candidate in the 1992 primaries, one of them
warned.
   Another, Richard A. Viguerie, said Bush ``took a sharp turn to
the left'' shortly after his election. ``It is the conservatives in
the Republican Party that have produced the money, the workers and
the votes all these years,'' said Viguerie, president of the United
Conservatives of America.
   ``Whenever there's a close presidential race and the Republican
nominee abandons his conservative voters, they lose,'' Viguerie
said. He cited as examples the races of 1948, when New York Gov.
Thomas A. Dewey lost to President Truman; 1960, when Richard Nixon
lost to John Kennedy and 1976, when President Ford lost to Jimmy
Carter.
   Viguerie and four other leaders of the conservative movement
joined together at a news conference to cite issue after issue as
grounds for their concern. Topics ranged from trade concessions for
China to support for government-financed art that may be considered
obscene, but it was clear their biggest complaint was with the
president's abandonment of his ``no new taxes'' pledge.
   Politicians may change their minds but ``when a politician does
that on a core defining issue he used to get elected, he sells out
not just his followers but he weakens the system,'' said David A.
Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union.
   Bush has ``dealt a crippling blow to his own credibility,''
Keene said.
   The conservatives' news conference was timed to coincide with a
meeting of the Republican National Committee in Chicago. RNC
spokeswoman Leslie Goodman in Chicago said she was unfamiliar with
the conservatives' comments and declined to respond.
   The five conservatives released a letter to party Chairman Lee
Atwater protesting that the administration had showed ``that it
does not intend to honor the commitments made to the American
people in the 1988 presidential campaign.''
   The conservative leaders showed some differences among
themselves. Viguerie said he thought Bush had sailed under a
``false flag'' of conservatism in 1988, and now was reverting ``to
the big-business, country-club kind of Republican he was in the
'60s and the '70s.''
   Keene, however, said Bush did not sail under any false flags,
but rather had been seduced by high poll ratings. The president
appears not to know that ``success in the polls has a history of
breeding failure,'' he said.
   Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, said ``It
is too early to tell what any of us is going to do.'' But Phillips
said that if Bush ``stays in his present course he will be
challenged in 1992, almost certainly in the Republican primaries
and certainly in the general election.''
   Also participating in the news conference were L. Brent Bozell
III, executive director of the Conservative Victory Committee, and
John Cregan, president of the U.S. Business and Industrial Council.

<HEAD>Federal Investigators to Examine Chicago Census Procedures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of federal investigators is being sent to
Chicago to examine alleged irregularities in local census
data-gathering efforts, a Commerce Department official said Friday.
   Elizabeth Barlowe, deputy counsel to the Commerce Department's
inspector general, declined to say what spurred the investigation
by her agency, which oversees the Census Bureau.
   The Chicago Tribune reported Thursday that about 200 valid
census questionnaires may have been destroyed in a north side
Chicago census office.
   Workers in that office may have falsified information because of
confusion over a nationwide Census Bureau policy of marking a house
``vacant'' when workers can't reach anyone inside, the newspaper
said.
   ``We do have an investigation into some allegations of
irregularities,'' Ms. Barlowe said in a telephone interview from
Washington. ``That's really all I can say.''
   Ms. Barlowe said federal investigators would arrive Monday. She
said investigators also were looking into census operations in
Atlanta. She did not elaborate on the problems there.
   The Tribune reported that a manager in the north side Chicago
office once asked a colleague for a shredder so he could destroy a
stack of census forms. The manager admitted asking for the shredder
but denies destroying the documents, the newspaper said.
   In addition, the Tribune said, other workers in that office said
the manager ordered data gatherers not to report a residence as
vacant if people were believed to be living there but could not be
reached.
   The newspaper said the manager instead ordered workers to record
those residences as having one resident because he believed the
city would lose money if occupied homes were recorded as vacant.

   An extremist Islamic group claimed
responsibility Friday for the July 5 explosion at a Texas chemical
plant that killed 17 people, but U.S. officials and a company
spokesman dismissed the claim.
   A spokesman for the Islamic Liberation Front told The Associated
Press that the Arco Chemical Co. Plant in Channelview, Texas, was
attacked because the United States supports Israel despite ``its
killings and terrorism against our Palestinian families'' in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   He refused to give any details of the alleged operation for
``security reasons.''
   Arco Chemical Co. of North America said from its headquarters in
Newtown Square, Pa., they were surprised by the claim because
federal investigators say they've found no signs of sabotage in the
explosion.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said there was no reason to believe the explosion at the chemical
plant was the result of terrorists.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which is
investigating the blast, said in a statement released in Washington
that ``there is absolutely no information to substantiate this
reputed claim.''
   The Arco plant, 15 miles east of Houston, was wrecked by the
explosions and fire, which leveled an area the size of a city block.
   Arco spokeswoman Sallie Anderson said Friday from the company's
headquarters that the cause of the explosion had not been
determined. She also said she was unaware of any recent threats
against the company and that the company had no dealings with
Israel.
   An Islamic Liberation Front spokesman, who identified himself as
Bassam Walid said: ``One of our unit commanders, operating in the
United States of America, informed our headquarters in the occupied
territories last Friday that our comrades had set ablaze a Texas
chemical factory and that the mission was successfully
accomplished.''
   Walid appeared in person at the AP office to make his statement.
   In a telephone call several hours after he appeared in the AP
office, Walid said: ``Many more attacks will be launched against
U.S. targets ... inside America and around the world.''
   He said attacks would also be made against the U.S. military,
but no attacks would be carried out against civilians.
   The Front is a relatively large group based in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. It has followers in Jordan and several other Arab
countries.
   It advocates the elimination of the Jewish state.

<HEAD>Nostalgia: 25-cent Ferry Fare Going, Going, Gone</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Like Steeplechase Park and Ebbets Field, New
Yorkers will soon be wistfully recalling the 25-cent Staten Island
ferry ride.
   The round-trip ride past the Statue of Liberty, referred to by
many as the best bargain in town, is being doubled to 50 cents Aug.
1 to ease the city's budget crunch.
   Despite protests from commuters in the city's least populated
borough, Mayor David Dinkins made it a done deal Thursday when he
signed the fare increase into law.
   It is only the second official price hike in the history of the
ferry, which was taken over by the city from the B&amp;O Railroad in
1905.
   The ferry cost a nickel each way when Edna St. Vincent Millay
wrote: ``We were very tired, we were very merry. We had gone back
and forth all night on the ferry.''
   But the famous nickel ride was fudged in 1972 when it became a
10-cent round trip, collected in Manhattan; it was altogether
obliterated when the fare went to a quarter in 1975 at the height
of the city's fiscal troubles.
   New fiscal woes have caused Dinkins to raise the fare again. The
mayor, facing a $1.8 billion deficit, says the increase will add $2
million to city coffers.
   The Staten Island ferry, which glides past but does not stop at
the Statue of Liberty, carries 30,000 commuters daily and is one of
the cheapest tourist attractions in New York.
   The seven-mile trip across New York Harbor is called ``a tourist
mecca of great delight,'' by the Architects Guide to New York and
``America's biggest bargain,'' by Geoffrey Moorhouse in his book,
``Imperial New York.''
   Those who deal in the sightseer trade doubt that doubling the
fare will have any appreciable effect on tourists.
   ``At a quarter or 50 cents, in our judgment it's still the
greatest travel bargain anywhere in the world,'' said Marshall
Murdaugh, president of the New York Visitors and Convention Bureau.
   ``I don't think a half a buck is going to upset anyone,'' said
Manny Strumpf, a spokesman for the National Park Service, which
operates the Statue of Liberty.
   By comparison, the Circle Line ferry service which drops
passengers off at the statue costs $4.
   But don't mention the increase to Staten Islanders, already put
upon by new laws limiting their voice in city government.
   To them, the hike is ``another nail in the coffin,'' as one
councilman's aide put it, and all the more reason for the island
and its population of about 400,000 to secede from the city.
   The oft-heard secession battle cry was rejuvenated last year
after the U.S. Supreme Court abolished the city Board of Estimate
and the core of Staten Island's political powerbase.
   ``This kind of action creates the atmosphere for secession,''
Michael Christiano, an aide to Staten Island Borough President Guy
V. Molinari, said before the mayor made the ferry hike history.
   ``The entire population of Staten Island is utterly incensed,''
said Walter Kramer, chief aide to city Councilman Jerome O'Donovan.
   He said many feel they are being treated unfairly because Staten
Island is the only borough where commuters must pay a fee to get to
the rest of the city _ and often as many as three commuting fees to
get to work.

   Thousands of motorists saw a man slumped

realize he was dead, police said.
   A woman called police Thursday after she saw the unidentified
man in the same position for two days on Interstate 35 near
downtown San Antonio, patrolman Richard Smith said Thursday.
   Officers said the man, a Hispanic between age 35 and 40, was
sitting with his head slumped and a full can of beer within easy

   ``That's a common place for vagrants to go to get out of the

   Foul play is not suspected but an autopsy will be performed,
police said.

conservatives' criticism of Bush.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle on Friday tried to calm
GOP fears about the political impact of President Bush's reversal
on taxes and demanded that Democrats make the next move by
proposing sensitive spending cuts.
   Quayle told the Republican National Committee that Bush put
taxes on the negotiating table to spur deficit reduction talks but
would not accept any deal that would hurt the economy _ or the
Republican Party.
   ``He will not accept a bad deal,'' Quayle said in a speech to
GOP leaders from across the country. ``His position is simple: a
good deal _ or no deal at all.''
   Many of the Republicans gathered in Chicago for the party's
two-day meeting believe that Bush's decision to abandon his
campaign pledge of ``no new taxes'' will hurt GOP candidates this
fall.
   But with Election Day four months away and the GOP already
fending off Democratic attacks over the savings and loan crisis,
Quayle and other Republican leaders were out to put the party on
the offensive on the tax issue.
   ``The president is willing to go the extra mile in seeking to
forge a budget agreement that would be good for America,'' Quayle
said. But he said the politically charged budget talks are ``not a
one-way street'' and tried to shift the focus from taxes to
spending.
   ``Today I call on the congressional Democrats to come forth with
their proposed spending cuts,'' Quayle said. ``Their silence on
this issue _ as usual _ is deafening.''
   Quayle's speech led a GOP effort to paint Bush's tax switch as a
sign of bold leadership. Democrats have tried to paint a different
picture, saying Bush is abandoning his no-tax pledge only because
of the soaring costs of an S&amp;L debacle they blame on the Reagan and
Bush administrations.
   Friday's focus on taxes and the budget talks came one day after
GOP leaders counterpunched the Democratic attacks on the savings
and loan crisis. Ed Rollins, chairman of the Republican
Congressional Campaign Committee, tried to place blame for the S&amp;L
bailout on the Democrats, charging they had ``sold out the
taxpayers.''
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., on Friday called the
remarks ``Mr. Rollins' emotional ravings'' and added, ``It sounded
like he was in a panic. ... It was sort of a running doggerel of
political invective.''
   The president's decision on taxes has brought him heat even
within his own party, but senior Republicans tried Friday to rally
support for Bush.
   ``It is the obligation of Republicans, I believe, to stand up
for the president when the president is willing to take the
political heat to stand up for the nation,'' said Republican
Illinois Gov. James Thompson.
   Party co-chairwoman Jeanie Austin sounded a similar theme,
saying of Bush: ``It is a measure of his leadership and his courage
that he's making the tough decisions today.''
   Back in Washington, five leading conservatives held a news
conference to accuse Bush of abandoning his conservative electoral
base and to urge him to return to the fold. Bush's shift on taxes
was one of their chief complaints.
   The five released a letter to party Chairman Lee Atwater
protesting that the Bush administration has indicated it ``does not
intend to honor the commitments made to the American people in the
1988 presidential campaign.''
   Atwater was hospitalized in Washington as part of his treatment
for a brain tumor. But GOP leaders in Chicago were following his
recent admonition to adopt a more aggressive stance, particularly
in the partisan fights over taxes and S&amp;Ls.
   Peggy Noonan, a former speechwriter to both presidents Reagan
and Bush, told the group Bush showed statesmanlike leadership in
putting taxes on the table for the budget talks.
   But she said Bush should walk away from the talks if Democrats
will not agree to substantial spending cuts and reforms in the
budget-writing process. Otherwise, she said, Bush will get the
blame for raising taxes and Democrats the credit for spending the
extra money on social programs.
   ``We must not lose the tax issue,'' she said. ``There is no more
potent issue than this.''
   The Republicans continued their S&amp;L offensive on Friday by
endorsing a resolution applauding Bush's handling of the crisis and
blaming the $300 billion-plus mess on the Democrats.
   ``While Democrats have been pointing fingers of blame, President
Bush has been rolling up his sleeves to make good on his promise to
settle the problem,'' the resolution said.

<TEXT>
   About 100,000 Albanians rallied Friday in
support of their Communist leaders, according to Albania's state
ATA news agency. Officials were reported to have condemned those
fleeing abroad and to have urged demonstrators to ``be united like
a fist around the party.''
   The rally was staged in Skanderbeg Square in Tirana, near the
row of foreign embassies used as safe haven by about 6,000
Albanians seeking to emigrate, according to the ATA report,
monitored in Vienna.
   About 4,500 of the Albanians in the embassies left Albania by
ship early Friday and arrived in Italy hours later. Most of those
remaining are slated to make their own way to freedom within days.
   The rally appeared to be an attempt by Albanian leadership to
demonstrate the majority of citizens in that country of 3.1 million
residents supported the hard-line Communist government that has
recently introduced modest reforms but continues to reject
political pluralism.
   Stung by the threat posed to Communist rule by the
asylum-seekers, the leadership has depicted them as social
undesirables, and comments to the rally by Xhelil Gjoni, a member
of the party's policy-making Politburo, were in the same vein.
   Gjoni was quoted by ATA as telling the crowd of at least 100,000
that those who are leaving ``do not represent Albania, they do not
represent the people.''
   ``In difficult moments be united like a fist round the
(Communist) party,'' he was quoted as saying. He suggested without
elaboration that Yugoslavia _ where harsh Serbian control of ethnic
Albanians is increasing _ is to blame for the unrest of the past
weeks.
   Gjoni reiterated modest economic reforms decided on last week,
such as sanctioning private enterprise limited to individuals or
families; a form of unemployment insurance; wage increases; and the
introduction of a form of unemployment insurance.
   The changes ``represent one of the clearest manifestations of
the continuous care of the party and state for the life of our
working people and their families,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The rush on the embassies was partially predicated by
dissatisfaction with shortages and low living standards, and hopes
of a better existence in the West.
   The reforms were clearly meant to relieve discontent, along with
the replacement of several ministers with economic portfolios.
   Albania, for decades the hermit of Europe because of its
isolationist course, embarked on cautious liberalization several
months ago. It has, among other things, signalled its willingness
to resume relations with the superpowers.
   The leadership also decreed that the people, long denied any
travel, had the right to passports, abolished the death penalty for
those caught fleeing the country and decriminalized religion.
   Gjoni acknowledged the existence of hardships but said only
Albanians could improve their lives.
   ``We still do not have the economy and the standard of living we
would like to,'' he said. ``We know these realities and make all
efforts to solve them ourselves. They cannot be solved by
foreigners but by us.''

   A flash fire broke out at a nuclear plant
Friday, killing one worker and injuring three, but no radiation was
released, utility company officials said.
   The fire broke out in electrical equipment away from the nuclear
reactor containment building at the D.C. Cook Nuclear Power Plant,
Indiana Michigan Power officials said.
   ``As such, there is no danger of radioactive release and no
danger to the public,'' spokesman Eustace Smarrella said in a
statement.
   Electrical production also was unaffected, Indiana Michigan
spokesman Wayne Hasty said from utility headquarters in Fort Wayne,
Ind.
   The dead man was employed by a contractor and was performing
maintenance on electrical equipment in one of two generating units
at the plant, the statement said. The man was killed when he
apparently touched a circuit breaker to which power had not been
shut off, it said.
   The blaze injured a second contract employee and two Indiana
Michigan workers. The company did not say where they were being
treated or explain the extent of their injuries.
   Names of the workers were not released.
   The unit had been shut down since June 29 for refueling and
maintenance. The other unit was not affected and remained in
service, the statement said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German Foreign Minister Markus Meckel
called for keeping all nuclear weapons out of Europe in a meeting
Friday with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   That would include the new surface-to-air missile known as TASM,
which the Bush administration wants to deploy.
   ``We feel we do not need them at all, on European soil or on
German soil,'' Meckel said of nuclear weapons.
   He also said Poland should not be worried about the merger of
East and West Germany.
   ``The future Germany will have good relations with countries in
the East,'' Meckel told reporters after seeing Baker.
   The two will meet again next week in Paris when Baker, Meckel
and the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Britain, France,
West Germany and Poland discuss Germany's future.
   The main issue is the border of Poland, which was divided
between Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II. Both West
and East Germany have told the Poles that a reunified Germany would
not expand.
   Meckel said both the merger of Germany and the border treaty
should be completed about the same time, probably in January. ``I
could not envisage a problem on what Poland requires,'' the East
German minister said.
   The United States agreed with its 15 allies at a North Atlantic
Treaty Organization summit last week in London to remove 1,470 U.S.
nuclear-tipped artillery shells once all Soviet troops are
withdrawn from Eastern and Central Europe.
   President Bush in May, at the behest of West Germany, decided
not to deploy new, short-range Lance missiles, although 700 older
U.S. nuclear-tipped Lances are in Western Europe.
   Also, 1,560 U.S. battlefield nuclear weapons are based in West
Germany and six other NATO countries, and the Bush administration
plans to deploy the more potent TASM missiles now being developed.
   Meckel said that in his meeting with Baker ``we discussed
nuclear weapons in general,'' but not the new missile specifically.
   He said Germans favor the ``zero option,'' meaning the
elimination of all short-range nuclear weapons. A U.S.-Soviet
treaty in 1987 banned all medium-range nuclear missiles.
   ``It is our strong interest to have all nuclear weapons go,''
Meckel said.

   A white suburban family can continue its foster
care for a black baby while the child's mother and social workers
try to settle a dispute over her children's placement, a judge
ruled Friday.
   Social workers have tried to move the woman's two children, ages
5 months and 14 months, to black foster homes in the inner city to
keep them in the same socioeconomic environment as their mother.
   While the younger child is staying with the white suburban
family, the 14-month-old is at a black foster mother's home.
   The children were taken from their mother earlier this year
after social workers determined the woman was unable to maintain a
proper home for them, said Jeff Aikin, a spokesman for the
Milwaukee County Department of Health and Social Services.
   The 30-year-old woman, who has not been named in court to
protect her children's identities, has not contested that her
children should be taken from her. But she has petitioned the court
to overrule the social workers and allow both children be placed
with the white couple, Beverly and David Cox.
   Milwaukee County Children's Court Judge Ronald S. Goldberger was
to rule on the mother's request Friday but adjourned the hearing
until Aug. 16 after lawyers met for 3{ hours and indicated the case
may be settled out of court.
   Until Aug. 16, the younger child will remain with the Coxes
while the older one will remain in the inner city foster home, the
judge ruled.
   The Coxes had originally joined the children's mother in
protesting the social workers' decision, arguing race should have
no affect on foster placement decisions.
   But Goldberger ruled last month the couple had no legal standing
in the case and only the children's mother could appeal the
placement.

   More locally heavy rain fell over parts of the eastern half of
the nation Friday, and temperatures dipped to record lows from the
Plains to New England.
   In the East, showers and thunderstorms continued to develop
along and ahead of a slow moving cold front curving through the
central Gulf Coast states, the southern Ohio Valley and the middle
Atlantic coast region during the morning and early afternoon.
   Showers and thunderstorms were developing along the same cold
front over the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and storms were
clustered over a few parts of the lower and middle Mississippi
Valley.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT
included 2.65 inches at Apalachicola, Fla., 2.48 inches at Panama
City, Fla., 1.48 inches at Knoxville, Tenn., and 1.44 inches at
Montgomery, Ala.
   It was unseasonably cool east of the Rockies, with afternoon
temperatures generally in the upper 60s and 70s.
   Temperatures in the 80s and lower 90s were primarily confined to
southern Texas, the central Gulf Coast states, and the southern
Atlantic Coast region.
   Temperatures were not quite as unseasonably hot as they have
been in the Pacific Northwest, where afternoon readings were mostly
in the 80s and 90s. However, temperatures again soared above 100 in
the valleys of northern and central California and the desert
Southwest.
   Overnight lows dipped below 60 across most of the area from the
Rocky Mountain region to New England, with lows in the 40s reported
in the northern and central Plains, the Great Lakes, and the
northern Atlantic Coast.
   Record lows for the date were set at Bridgeport, Conn., 57;
Dallas-Fort Worth, 64; Dodge City, Kan., 46; Duluth, Minn., 39; St.
Cloud, Minn., 44; and Goodland, Kan., 43. The previous record at
St. Cloud had stood since 1897.
   Friday's low for the Lower 48 states was 38 at Custer, S.D.

<TEXT>
   The House Appropriations Committee on Friday
approved $50.4 billion for agriculture spending in fiscal 1991, but
angered House Agriculture Committee leaders by virtually
eliminating crop insurance.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., whose Agriculture subcommittee has
been working on improvements to the crop insurance program, said an
amendment to restore funding would be offered during full House
debate if the program is not reinstated sooner.
   ``Abolishing the program while major improvements are under
consideration creates a situation whereby those improvements cannot
be put into effect in an orderly manner,'' Agriculture Committee
Chairman Kika de la Garza said in a letter to Appropriations
Chairman Jamie Whitten.
   The letter also was signed by English, Rep. Edward Madigan,
R-Ill., and Rep. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo.
   Madigan is ranking Republican on the full Agriculture Committee
and Coleman the ranking GOP member on English's subcommittee.
   Meanwhile, congressional leaders said the Senate expects to
start debate next week on the 1990 farm bill, with budget
constraints as the guiding force in determining the agriculture
policy for the next five years.
   ``Aside from the factor of time, the bottom line for acceptance
and passage of this legislation must be the budget,'' said Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole in a news release.
   The House version of the farm bill will be taken up next week by
the House Rules Committee, which will decide on the rules for
debating the measure on the House floor.
   The appropriations measure the House panel approved Friday
provides funding for all Agriculture Department agencies except the
Forest Service. It includes funds for the Food and Drug
Administration and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and
puts limits on funds for the Farm Credit Administration and the
Farm Credit System Assistance Board.
   The overall appropriation for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1
is $5 billion greater than fiscal 1990.
   The boost is reflected in higher allocations for administrative
salaries, payments to land-grant colleges, research grants, food
safety and inspection, marketing services and rural development.
   The popular food program for poor pregnant and nursing mothers
and their infants, known as WIC, was allocated $2.35 billion, an
increase of $195 million from this year and $109 million more than
the Bush administration requested.
   Whitten, D-Miss., a longtime opponent of crop insurance, favors
a system through which the government appropriates money to pay
farmers each time there is a substantial crop loss.
   The measure passed by Whitten's committee allows for $262
million to be spent next year on crop insurance administrative
phase-out costs and to make payments on any policies sold before
Oct. 1.
   The Bush administration, which also wants the program abolished,
has said $601 million would be needed in 1991 to operate crop
insurance at its current level. Spending for 1990 has been $400
million.
   ``A straight-out disaster program would be as expensive,''
English said.
   Only about 40 percent of eligible farmers buy crop insurance.
Farmers say they avoid the program because the premiums are too
high, yields are inadequate or because the price forecasting for
certain crops by the insurance companies is inaccurate.
   Farmers may buy insurance from either the government or private
companies. Thirty percent of all costs are paid by the federal
government.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Aide Confirms His Security Clearance Revoked</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aide to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
confirmed Friday that his security clearance was revoked for
failing to provide full background information for 18 months.
   Associate Deputy Attorney General Barry H. Stern, who turned in
his resignation this week, said he ignored repeated requests for
what he termed minor information.
   Stern also confirmed that until last week he hadn't signed an
oath that he had given truthful answers on the background
questionnaire he filed last year.
   ``If I didn't sign it, it was a pure oversight,'' said Stern,
adding that signed the oath after belatedly providing the
information sought by security officials. He also said he signed a
statement last year authorizing the FBI to conduct a background
investigation.
   Stern, a 43-year-old lawyer, said his security clearance was
revoked last month because he had failed to provide information
that involved addresses of some references and some job history
information.
   Stern, who oversaw the Justice Department's program for seizing
the assets of drug dealers, organized crime figures and other
convicted criminals, said his duties did not require him to have
access to classified information.
   The revocation of Stern's security clearance is the latest
personnel problem for Thornburgh, who reassigned two of his closest
aides after it was disclosed they ``showed deception'' on lie
detector tests during an FBI investigation of an unauthorized news
leak.
   The May reassignments of chief of staff Robert S. Ross Jr. and
press spokesman David Runkel were portrayed by officials as part of
an effort to dispel the perception that Thornburgh was surrounded
by political cronies.
   Stern is one of a group of aides to the attorney general who
served under Thornburgh when he was governor of Pennsylvania. He
will join a Philadelphia-area publishing company, LRP Press.
   Stern received a temporary security clearance when he joined the
Justice Department in September 1988 while the FBI completed a
background check.
   Such temporary clearances, usually lasting 14 months, allow top
officials to function in sensitive positions pending final approval
of permanent access to classified information, officials said.
   A Justice Department official familiar with the case said
Stern's delay in filing the information was unprecedented and
angered department security officials. Aides in Stern's position
normally file the requested information within several weeks of
taking office so the FBI can begin its work.
   The Justice Department's security office asked Stern in November
to provide several answers to questions that he had not completed,
including the addresses of references.
   Stern said he put off returning the form with the completed
answers over the Christmas holidays and continued to procrastinate
for six months despite intermittent requests.

<HEAD>Nearly $41,000 Spent on Travel by Prosecutors to Fraud Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It cost $40,985 to bring 87 U.S. attorneys to
Washington last month for a conference on thrift fraud that
featured a stump-style speech by President Bush, the Justice
Departent said Friday.
   The money was spent on travel and accommodations for the federal
prosecutors who attended the Financial Institution Fraud Conference
at the department.
   The major event of the conference was a speech by Bush to unveil
plans to seek additional resources for prosecuting savings and
loans fraud.
   The president's speech was made in direct response to growing
criticism by Democrats in Congress that the Bush administration was
not aggressively tracking down S&amp;L criminals.
   The conference was attended by 88 U.S. attorneys from around the
country and the District of Columbia. Jay B. Stephens, the U.S.
attorney in the nation's capital, didn't have to travel far. His
office is six blocks from the Justice Department.

<TEXT>
   More than 100 tons of a chemical that is
vital for the solid fuel in space shuttle boosters went up in
flames at a Kerr-McGee Corp. plant, near a similar plant that blew
up two years ago.
   No injuries were reported in Thursday night's fire, which was
extinguished in about 45 minutes.
   Damage was originally estimated at $200,000, but was revised
downward Friday to $135,000, said Kerr-McGee spokesman Myron
Cunningham.
   The cause of the accident was under investigation, Cunningham
said.
   The fire destroyed 106.5 tons of ammonium perchlorate, an
oxidizer which provides oxygen for the burning of solid rocket
fuel. Kerr-McGee produces about 1,500 tons of the material per
month, according to Rick Stater, plant operations manager.
   Stater and fire officials credited new fire safety regulations
with averting a disaster similar to one on May 4, 1988, when
ammonium perchlorate exploded and destroyed the Pacific Engineering
Co. or PEPCON plant a mile from the Kerr-McGee plant.
   Kerr-McGee and Pacific Engineering were the only companies in
the United States producing the critical oxidizer, which is also
used for some military rockets, and the loss of the plant left U.S.
officials facing a possible shortage.
   Pacific Engineering since has built a new plant in Cedar City,
Utah.
   The earlier blast killed two people and injured more than 300.
The blast rocked the Las Vegas Valley and caused more than $74
million in property damage, primarily in this community of 55,000,
some 25 miles southeast of Las Vegas.
   Following that blast, Clark County fire officials imposed strict
new fire safety codes at the Kerr-McGee plant. Included was a
provision that the ammonium perchlorate not be stored in one pile
but be divided up for storage on individual pads separated by
concrete walls.
   Stater and fire department spokesman Bob Leinbach said the
safety walls prevented the spread of the fire and possible
explosion.
   Leinbach said he did not know why the Kerr-McGee fire did not
produce an explosion similar to the Pacific Engineering blast.
   ``That may be one of the mysteries of life,'' Leinbach said.
``PEPCON was not supposed to explode.''
   Kerr-McGee is building a new plant in a remote area northwest of
Las Vegas for production of ammonium perchlorate.

<HEAD>Political Groups Slow to Support Chamorro's Plea for Dialogue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
received only limited support Friday following her appeal for a
national dialogue to avoid a repeat of the Sandinista-inspired
labor unrest that crippled the country.
   Five splinter centrist parties and a non-Sandinista labor
federation declared they would take part in such a national
dialogue after meeting with Mrs. Chamorro.
   But both the leftist Sandinistas, now the country's largest
opposition group, and the 14-party coalition that backed Mrs.
Chamorro when she mounted her presidential campaign did not
immediately indicate whether they would support her call for
negotiations.
   In announcing the strike settlement Thursday, Mrs. Chamorro
called for wide-ranging negotiations aimed at reaching a social
accord involving the new U.S.-backed government, the private sector
and the Sandinistas that ruled from 1979 until they left office on
April 25.
   The 10-day Sandinista-led strike was settled with an accord that
grants hefty wage hikes to government workers, pledges no mass
firings of public sector workers, and puts some key elements of the
new administration's plan to return Nicaragua to a free-market
economy on hold.
   The accord also calls for suspension of a decree to return land
confiscated in the 1979 Sandinista revolution to the original
owners.
   Mrs. Chamorro and her aides have said the settlement prevented
more bloodshed and unrest, and made it possible for Nicaragua to
get back down to business.
   But the business community and some leaders of the governing
coalition have complained the settlement resulted in concessions
that were a victory for the Sandinistas and a defeat for the
administration's plan to restore a free-market economy.
   In a joint statement Friday, the leaders of the five small
centrist parties declared their readiness to participate in the
dialogue. The five parties _ the Popular Social Christian, Social
Christian, Revolutionary Unity Movement, Liberal for National
Unification and Conservative Democratic _ support Mrs. Chamorro but
are not members of the governing coalition.
   ``The dialogue must serve to force the Sandinistas to commit
themselves not to use violence again to obtain political and labor
conquests,'' the party leaders said they told Mrs. Chamorro.
   ``Equilibrium and social peace can only be achieved through
unity and national identity,'' the statement said.
   The Permanent Labor Congress, a federation of unions linked to
Mrs. Chamorro's coalition, also announced it would support her call
for dialogue.
   ``Dona Violeta's idea is a good one, because the country needs
to know the opinion of all Nicaraguans in order to strive for
peace,'' Nilo Salazar, a Labor Congress leader, told reporters.
   The Sandinistas have not yet formally reacted to Mrs. Chamorro's
proposal.
   Former President Daniel Ortega, unseated by Mrs. Chamorro's
United National Opposition coalition in the Feb. 25 elections, told
reporters Wednesday night that ``an understanding must be reached
with the Sandinistas and their revolution to contribute to the
country's stability.''
   The governing coalition, whose fractious members range from
communists to hard-line conservatives, appeared to be divided over
its response to the settlement and Mrs. Chamorro's appeal for
dialogue.
   After the announcement of the settlement, the 14 parties
established a Committee for National Solidarity headed by Vice
President Virgilio Godoy. But it was unclear what action the
committee would take.
   Godoy, a conservative who has frequently criticized Mrs.
Chamorro, has termed the settlement a success for the Sandinistas,
claiming it has nullified the government's efforts to assert
control.
   The nation's leading business group, the Superior Council of
Private Enterprise, criticized the government for giving in to what
it called Sandinista ``blackmail.''
   Gilberto Cuadra, the business group's president, said the
settlement had left the government's economic recovery program
``bleeding'' and dampened hopes of attracting foreign investment.
   He said the business group estimates the strike caused $35
million to $50 million in lost business, property damage and
diminished crops.
   The strike posed the most serious threat yet to Mrs. Chamorro's
new government.
   During the last six days of the strike, street fighting broke
out between strike supporters and opponents, claiming at least four
lives.

   Congressional talks on a final clean air bill
began Friday as a White House aide said the president remains
strongly opposed to giving financial aid to workers who lose jobs
because of tougher pollution requirements.
   The House-Senate negotiations over the first strengthening of
federal air pollution laws in 13 years are expected to take weeks
as numerous differences in the complex House and Senate bills are
worked out.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., head of the House delegation to the
talks, made clear that he will not be rushed. ``We have an enormous
amount of work ahead of us,'' he said.
   Dingell rejected pleas by senators at the hour-long session for
a quick response to two initial Senate proposals on two relatively
obscure parts of the legislation.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., conference chairman, said ``we have to
work quickly'' if a compromise bill is to be completed before
Congress adjourns in early October.
   No date was set for the next session of the House and Senate
conferees.
   Bills passed last spring by wide margins in both the House and
Senate call for tougher pollution controls on factories,
automobiles and electric power plants to reduce urban smog, toxic
industrial releases and acid rain by the end of the decade.
   But scores of differences remain between the two bills.
   A major issue is job protection for workers who lose jobs
because of tougher pollution controls. The House bill contains a
three-year, $250 million assistance program for such workers, but
the Senate version does not.
   Roger Porter, President Bush's chief domestic policy adviser,
who will sit in on the talks, said the administration remains
``fundamentally opposed'' to a job-loss assistance provision. He
said he would recommend the president veto the bill if it contains
such aid.
   Supporters of the assistance contend Bush would be hard pressed
to scuttle the massive package solely because it provides money for
the unemployed. They argue that the $250 million cost of the
program is relatively small over three years.
   But administration officials have argued there is no way to
control the costs of mandated assistance. ``It sets a precedent
that we're uncomfortable with,'' said Porter.
   Although no substantive agreements were reached in the first
negotiating session, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said he remained ``hopeful and certain'' a compromise
clean air bill can be worked out before Congress is scheduled to
adjourn in October.
   But some senators and environmentalists expressed concern this
week that the tight congressional schedule may jeopardize strong
legislation, especially if it is held over for final action in a
possible lame-duck session after the November election.
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said after the meeting that he was
``plenty worried because we don't have much time.''
   Chafee and other senators offered two recommendations to resolve
differences on permit requirements and on dealing with
ozone-destroying chemicals. But Dingell said only that the House
would refer the matters to staff members for analysis.
   Other areas likely to raise controversy are a House requirement
for automakers to build alternative fuel cars as a pilot program in
California; a requirement strongly opposed by oil companies that
ethanol-blend fuels be used in some smog-plagued cities; whether to
require small industrial polluters to comply with new smog
controls; and whether to retain a House provision that calls for
pollution controls over national parks.

<HEAD>First Clinical Trial Begins for Juvenile Diabetes Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON WORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University of Florida researchers
announced Friday the first clinical trials of a drug they hope will
prevent juvenile diabetes, the most deadly strain of the disease.
   The study is being led by diabetes specialists at the
university's Health Science Center. It involves giving daily doses
of an immunosuppressant drug called Imuran to people likely to be
afflicted.
   Also known as Type 1 or insulin-dependent diabetes, juvenile
diabetes affects 1 million people and kills 300,000 Americans each
year, said Dr. Noel Maclaren, a UF pathologist.
   The medical centers involved in the study will offer free
screening to close relatives of people who have Type 1 diabetes.
   The National Institutes of Health granted $3.5 million to pay
for the screening of about 10,000 people, while about 80 who have
indications of diabetes would receive the new drug.
   Besides the University of Florida, participating centers include
the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard Medical School, the Barbara
Davis Foundation and Denver Children's Hospital in Denver and the
University of Washington in Seattle.
   The study is the result of research by Maclaren and Mark
Atkinson, who discovered antibodies that precede the onset of
juvenile diabetes.
   In the June issue of the British medical journal Lancet,
Atkinson reported that an antibody he isolated can be detected up
to seven years before symptoms of diabetes appear.
   Peggy Polopolus of Gainesville, who has been taking the drug
since 1984, has not developed diabetes despite having Type 1
antibodies.
   ``We're convinced the medication has prevented the disease,''
said Dr. William Riley, who is directing the nationwide clinical
trials.
   The drug keeps the body's immune system from destroying cells in
the pancreas while it produces insulin, a hormone essential to the
body's storage and use of sugars for energy, Riley said.
   Several patients who received Imuran after being diagnosed with
Type 1 diabetes were able to stay off insulin for up to two years.

<HEAD>Leaks in Atlantis, Columbia Different, NASA Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hydrogen leaks crippling space
shuttles Atlantis and Columbia appear to be in different places,
ruling out the possibility that the problems are related, NASA said
Friday.
   ``The things that we know leak on one we know aren't leaking on
the other,'' said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight
program.
   A common problem with the shuttles' fuel system would have been
much more difficult to deal with, said shuttle director Robert
Crippen.
   Early indications following an elaborate test of Atlantis' fuel
system Friday are that hydrogen escaped from a flange on the
external tank side of a 17-inch-diameter valve, Lenoir said. The
valve is in a pipe that carries fuel from the tank to the main
engines.
   No leaks were found in that area on the plumbing from Columbia
that was sent for laboratory testing to shuttle builder Rockwell
International Corp. in Downey, Calif., Lenoir said.
   Rockwell engineers believe Columbia's problem lies in a small,
Teflon shaft seal on the orbiter side of the valve, Lenoir said.
   But further tests are needed before concluding there are no
leaks on the two shaft seals on the side of the external tank, he
said.
   Earlier this week, NASA officials said the main suspect appeared
to be a U-shaped Teflon seal in the 17-inch pipe on the orbiter
side. Later, that proved to be fine.
   Lenoir said the problem with Columbia has been corrected since
new plumbing was installed in the faulty area. The new components
were taken from the shuttle Endeavour, under construction in
California.
   It's too soon to say how NASA will deal with Atlantis' leak,
Lenoir said.
   The solution may be as simple as tightening the seal, which
could be done at the launch pad. Putting in a new seal would
require a return to the hangar, he said.
   ``About all we can do at the pad is tighten up the bolts,''
Lenoir said.
   NASA wants to launch at least one shuttle before Discovery's
scheduled flight with the sun-exploring Ulysses satellite in
October, Crippen said. The most likely candidate is Atlantis, on a
classified Defense Department mission.
   Discovery has until Oct. 23 to lift off with Ulysses because of
the alignment of Earth, the sun and Jupiter. Otherwise, the flight
must be delayed for 13 months.
   Lenoir said there is no reason to believe Discovery has a leak.
It's uncertain whether that shuttle will undergo a tanking test
prior to launch, he said. The space agency wants to avoid making
such tests routine, he said.
   Columbia's leak was discovered during fueling for a May 30
launch attempt. A test a week later duplicated the leak, and the
shuttle was returned to the hangar for repairs.
   As a precaution, NASA conducted a similar test on Atlantis on
June 29 as the shuttle awaited a mid-July liftoff. A leak was
detected, and the agency grounded the three-shuttle fleet.
   It was the first time all of the shuttles had been grounded
since the 1986 Challenger explosion. The next shuttle did not fly
until 1988.

<TEXT>
   The murder trial of winery worker Ramon
Salcido, accused of killing his wife, two daughters and four
others, was delayed for a week Friday.
   San Mateo Superior Court Judge Phrasel Shelton granted the
request of defense attorney Marteen Miller, who said his wife has
malaria and needs his care.
   Assistant District Attorney Peter Bumerts, who fought earlier
delay attempts, did not object at the emergency afternoon court
session held in Redwood City, where Salcido's trial is now
scheduled to begin July 23.
   Jury selection had been scheduled to begin Monday.
   On Thursday, the 1st District Court of Appeal refused to grant a
two-month delay, which Miller had sought saying he needed time to
convince Mexican authorities to hand over extradition papers that
could prevent the prosecution from seeking the death penalty.
   However, prosecutors say Miller is stalling and that a
U.S.-Mexico treaty does not bar the death penalty.
   Salcido, 29, is accused of killing his wife, two daughters, his
mother-in-law, her two daughters and a co-worker 15 months ago.
   A third daughter, 2 years old at the time of the attack, had her
throat slit but survived and lives with a foster family.
   After the attacks, Salcido fled to Mexico, where he was arrested
and gave a full confession.
   Miller said he would not dispute the facts of the case, but
would argue against the death penalty by showing that Salcido was
drunk and high on cocaine and suffered other mental impairments
during the attacks.
   San Mateo Superior Court Judge Reginald Littrell, a visiting
Sierra County judge who will preside over the trial, said jury
selection should take about six weeks, with the trial to last at
least another month.
   The trial was moved from Sonoma County, the area north of San
Francisco where the murders occurred, to San Mateo, south of the
city, because of pre-trial publicity.

   When a young sailor wrote a letter to his
parents during the Vietnam War, he forgot to include the ZIP code.
   That might have made it a little late, but doesn't account for
all 23 years, the U.S. Postal Service says.
   Bert Budai wrote his parents a 2{-page letter filled with
typical adventures of a young sailor during the war. He returned
home in 1969 and his parents later died.
   But the post office delivered the letter Tuesday to Budai's
former home in Ravenna, just across the road from where he now
lives.
   ``I was quite shocked,'' said Budai, now 44, married and
stepfather of two children. ``My sister lives in my father's house
now and it came to that address and she brought it over to me.''
   The letter is postmarked Oct. 17, 1966 _ the same day Budai
penned it aboard the USS Valley Forge, a helicopter carrier
stationed off the Philippines.
   Stamped with an 8-cent air mail stamp, the envelope included
Budai's shipboard return address, in care of the San Francisco post
office. The mailing address lacked the Ravenna ZIP code, but Joseph
L. Johnson, communications manager for the Grand Rapids division of
the postal service, doesn't think that made much difference.
   ``It you don't include a ZIP code it might delay it a couple of
days, but certainly not 23 years,'' Johnson said. ``Of course, we
apologize for the late delivery.''

<HEAD>20,000 Romanians Demonstrate Against President Iliescu</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 20,000 demonstrators marched
Friday to demand the release of a jailed activist who had been
savagely beaten by vigilante miners loyal to President Ion Iliescu.
   Shortly after the orderly demonstration, Iliescu went on state
television to appeal for national trust and criticized those who
seek to teach Romania ``lessons of democracy.''
   The march was among the largest street gatherings in Bucharest
since the December revolution overthrew Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu. Ceausescu and his wife Elena were executed Dec. 25.
   Iliescu implored Romanians to ``do away with the atmosphere of
suspicion'' and called on the police to crack down on corrupt
bureaucrats and black marketeers, who he blamed for the shortages
now plaguing the country.
   Demonstrators marched on the government building in Victory
Square and demanded the release of jailed student leader Marian
Munteanu. They shouted anti-Iliescu slogans and carried signs
equating Iliescu's National Salvation Front with the defunct
Romanian Communist Party.
   Munteanu was a leader of the 53-day opposition rally that
blocked central Bucharest until June 13, when police tried to put
it down. The resulting violence killed at least six people.
   Munteanu was badly beaten by pro-government miners whom Iliescu
urged to come to the capital to impose order. The miners
subsequently terrorized the capital, and Munteanu was arrested in
connection with the anti-government violence several days later
while he was still hospitalized.
   Iliescu, a former Communist official, won free elections in May
but opponents demanded he step down because of his hard-line past.
   He was harshly criticized by the world community for the miners'
rampage, a and the United States and other nations cut off millions
of dollars in non-humanitarian aid to Romania.
   In an indirect slap at the United States, Iliescu criticized
``those among our friends who now treat us with lack of faith...
who coquetted with Ceausescu's regime and now want to give us
lessons on democracy.'' For years, Washington maintained fairly
close ties with Ceausescu, who it viewed as relatively independent
of Moscow.
   Asking Romanians to ``settle into a more constructive climate,''
Iliescu said: ``Let's overcome our climate of suspicion... Let's
overcome partisan interests and create a climate of cooperation and
quiet work.''
   Turning to the huge economic problems, Iliescu attacked ``the
phenomenon of corruption'' in Romania's still-powerful bureaucracy.
   On Thursday, Prime Minister Petre Roman also attacked the
managerial ``incompetence'' brought on by decades of communism.
   He called for more police action against black marketeers who
deplete stores by bribing officials and vendors and then sell
products at higher prices.
   ``For some the idea of free initiative ... means accumulating
personal wealth without work... a parasitic way of life,'' he
declared. ``Honest free initiative means amplification of
production and services, not recycling of the insufficient supply.''
   Iliescu avoided the issue of Munteanu or the other
anti-government activists who have been charged with various
offenses and imprisoned.
   The demonstrators were blocked from approaching the government
building in Victory Square by several hundred police. After
converging on the government building shouting ``Down with
communism,'' the 20,000 marchers _ accompanied by police _ circled
back and retraced their route to the starting point at Opera Square.
   The crowd shouted: ``Try the miners!'' and ``Try the one who
called them!'' in reference to Iliescu.
   Halfway down their route the marchers stopped at the Justice
Ministry and a delegation left a petition calling for the release
of all jailed activists.
   ``The arrests are an outrage,'' said 37-year-old photographer
Cristian Duma.
   The National Liberal Youth League on Friday also appealed for
Munteanu's release, but assailed the attacks on government
buildings by anti-government demonstrators on June 13. It was
during these attacks that most of the fatalities reportedly occured.
   The Ecological Movement, meanwhile, accused the government of
``totalitarian inclinations.'' The charge was made at a Friday news
conference called to protest this week's refusal by the Education
Ministry's to recognize new private universities. Among them is the
Ecologists' university in the former Communist Party building.

<HEAD>More Cubans Seek Refuge in Spanish Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two more Cubans have taken refuge at the
Spanish Embassy in Havana, bringing to 17 the number of
asylum-seekers at foreign embassies in Cuba's capital, according to
official reports Friday.
   In a related development, five other Cubans seeking asylum
briefly held a Czechoslovak diplomat hostage in his Havana
apartment, the official Czchoslovak news agency CTK reported Friday.
   The report came as Czechoslovakia urged Cuba to provide free
passage to the Cubans who had sought shelter earlier this week at
Prague's embassy in Havana, and said it would not hand them over to
Cuban authorities.
   The Cubans apparently followed the example of thousands of
Albanians who recently flooded foreign embassies in their capital,
Tirana, to seek asylum and received permission to leave their
Communist homeland.
   Cuba and Albania remain among the last hard-line Communist
countries in the world and have resisted the democratic reforms
sweeping Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   In Madrid, Spain, a Spanish foreign ministry spokesman said two
more Cubans entered the Spanish Embassy in Havana on Friday
afternoon, joining another asylum-seeker there.
   The Mexican government news agency Notimex also reported that
three Cubans were seeking refuge in the Spanish Embassy, in a
report from Havana monitored in Mexico City. Notimex said two young
men went to the consular section at the Spanish Embassy on Friday
and declared that nobody could make them leave.
   ``We have given them protection while we study the situation,''
said Spanish foreign ministry spokesman Juan Lena. He said the
Spanish government was seeking permission from Cuban authorities to
send the asylum-seekers to a third country.
   The Spanish ambassador to Cuba, Antonio Serrano de Haro, cut
short a vacation in Madrid to return to Havana on Friday.
   Lena said he did not know the identities of the two new
refugees. The first Cuban, identified as 27-year-old Luis
Monteagudo Rodriguez, sought refuge in the Spanish Embassy on
Wednesday in an effort to escape the hard-line Communist government.
   Monteagudo was jailed from 1985 to 1988 after he tried to seek
asylum at the U.S. Interests Section, which operates out of the
Swiss Embassy in Havana, the Spanish news agency EFE said, citing
diplomatic sources in Havana.
   In Prague, CTK quoted the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry as
saying five Cubans forced their way into the downtown Havana
apartment of Czechoslovak charge d'affaires Jan Doemoek on Thursday.
   Doemoek was held hostage for several hours, the statement said.
The five demanded to join the Cubans in Prague's Havana embassy,
the Foreign Ministry said.
   Doemoek eventually escaped ``using a trick'' and immediately
informed Cuban authorities of the incident, emphasizing that Prague
would not provide refuge to these five ``violent instigators,'' the
statement added.
   The ministry's statement did not specify what had happened to
the five, but it denied what it said were Cuban reports that there
were now 19 asylum-seekers inside the Czechoslovak Embassy.
   Czechoslovakia's Deputy Foreign Minister Lubos Dobrovsky was
quoted by CTK as saying it was ``in the interest of both
countries'' for Cuba to allow safe passage as soon as possible.
   He later met senior Soviet, West German and Italian diplomats to
ask their help in resolving the situation, CTK said. It did not
elaborate.
   Czechoslovak officials say at least nine of the Cubans in the
embassy have requested political asylum.
   Tension has grown between Cuba and Czechoslovakia, two former
allies, since Czechoslovakia's democratic revolution last year.
   Cuba's Foreign Ministry, in a tough statement reported by EFE
from Havana, accused Czechoslovakia late Thursday of provoking the
asylum-seeking by Cubans it described as ``habitual bums.''
   Dobrovsky told the Cuban ambassador the refugees sought shelter
in the embassy ``without any Czechoslovak participation,'' CTK said.
   In April 1980, thousands of disaffected Cubans jammed the
Peruvian Embassy in Havana. Shortly thereafter, many joined what
became the Mariel boatlift, which eventually took 125,000 Cubans to
Florida.

   The mayors of Moscow and Leningrad joined Boris N.
Yeltsin in quitting the Communist Party on Friday, putting the
country's two largest cities as well as its heartland republic in
the hands of non-Communists.
   It was not immediately clear how the resignations of the three
leading reformers would affect their party organizations.
   Yeltsin began the exodus Thursday and it gathered steam as the
party's 28th congress drew to a close. Leaders of the Democratic
Platform reform group said they would cap their departures by
founding their own, non-Communist party this fall.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the president and party leader, said in an
interview with CBS News that he had ``contempt'' for those who left
the party.
   He told the congress in a closing address that ``those who
demand party repentance and the settling of accounts and brand the
party as almost a criminal organization are simply out to remove it
from the political scene and thereby deal a blow to the entire
cause of revolutionary renewal.''
   Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov and Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak
said in a statement that the two-week congress ``showed the
complete inability of the party to offer the country a real program
of transition to a new society.''
   Popov, an economist, and Sobchak, a lawyer, were elected this
spring as reform-minded candidates swept to power in local
councils. Under their leadership, the two city councils have been
trying to break the control of local Communist Party organizations.
   They have been active in the same reform circles of Soviet
politics as Yeltsin.
   Moscow has about 9 million people and Leningrad has 5 million.
They are by far the largest cities in the Soviet Union.
   In his closing speech, Gorbachev said the party intended ``to
drastically change its attitude to elected governing councils,
renounce attempts at substituting for them, make every effort to
assist them to stand up firmly on their feet, and help deputies
deal with problems involved in meeting vital popular needs.''
   Yeltsin, elected in May as president of the huge Russian
federation, told the congress Thursday he was quitting the party.
As president of the Russian republic, which has three-quarters of
the Soviet Union's territory and 52 percent of its people, he must
listen to all political parties and cannot obey only the Communist
Party, he said. Moscow and Leningrad both lie within the Russian
republic.
   The Tass news agency quoted Yeltsin as telling the Russian
parliament on Friday that he made the decision ``with a heavy
heart.'' At the party congress, delegates voted to strip him of his
congress credentials.
   An aide to Popov, who is traveling outside the Soviet Union,
read the statement from the Moscow and Leningrad mayors to
reporters in Moscow's City Hall.
   ``Aware of our responsibility before the people and history, we
have decided to withdraw from the Communist Party to help create a
multiparty system and to have the possibility to more effectively
lead the councils we head,'' the statement said.
   Leaders of Democratic Platform made a declaration after
Yeltsin's speech Thursday that they also were quitting the party.
They said they would struggle to gain a fraction of the party's
vast wealth in proportion to the percentage of the 18 million
Communist Party members who join their new party.
   At a news conference, they said they would hold a founding
congress for a new, non-Communist party in October, and that they
believed many party members would follow them.
   ``People see that the vicious circle has been broken,'' said
Democratic Platform leader Vladimir Lysenko of Moscow.
   Gorbachev ``doesn't understand the size of the movement that
started yesterday,'' added Stepan Sulakhin of the Siberian city of
Tomsk.
   While Democratic Platform does not expect Yeltsin to join,
``Boris Yeltsin remains the leader of the entire democratic
movement,'' he said.
   But Sulakhin and other Democratic Platform leaders said it was
too early to say exactly how many members of their own
organization, and of the party itself, would join.
   The new party also will have to work out its programs in the
coming months, they said.
   ``Our party will not be a Communist Party, but it will not be a
party of confrontation,'' said Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, who has
been the rector of Higher Party School in Moscow. ``It will be a
party of social progress.''
   Shostakovsky said the new party would accept both market
economics and private property in a new economic system, but that
the approach must be ``well-thought out.''
   Shostakovsky estimated months ago that Democratic Platform had
500,000 to 600,000 supporters among Communist Party members.
Surveys by the group indicate that about 40 percent of the 18
million members of the Communist Party are sympathizers.

   A group of jail inmates bent on avenging the
knifing of their Muslim religious leader stormed a cellblock at a
city jail Friday, and 39 officers were injured trying to stop the
fighting.
   At least 19 of the 60 inmates involved in the brawl at Riker's
Island also were injured, said Correction Department spokeswoman
Ruby Ryles. Seventeen weapons were recovered in the cellblock
hallway after the fight, she said.
   Rikers Island is the maximum security city jail, located on an
island in the East River off the borough of Queens.
   According to Ryles, the fight stemmed from Thursday night's
stabbing by inmate Rolando Gonzalez of Andrew Jackson, the elected
imam, or spiritual leader, of the jail's Muslim population.
Authorities said they didn't know what prompted the stabbing.
   Forty-eight Muslim inmates were returning from church services
around 3 p.m. Friday when they passed Gonzalez's cellblock, Ryles
said.
   ``They tried to crash the block and get their revenge on
Gonzalez,'' she said. A dozen inmates in the hallway clashed with
the Muslim prisoners, and 50 correction officers were called in to
subdue the brawlers.
   Four of the injured officers and two injured inmates were
hospitalized, she said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev closed the Communist Party's
28th congress Friday by saying he would welcome Western aid without
political strings, and warning of a ``gap'' between the party and
the people.
   The congress elected a new 412-member Central Committee that
appeared to be packed with moderate reformers of the Gorbachev
mold. And Gorbachev ousted hard-liner Yegor K. Ligachev from the
Central Committee and the Politburo.
   The nearly 4,700 delegates to the congress closed their
tumultuous two-week session by giving themselves a standing ovation
and singing ``The Internationale,'' the socialist anthem.
   The congress was the stormiest in the Kremlin since 1921, when
Bolshevik revolutionaries faced violent uprisings among workers and
sailors.
   It also marked a major political victory for Gorbachev, and
cemented his hold over the party. It will be a different party,
however, with the exodus of maverick Boris N. Yeltsin and other
reformers.
   The congress opened July 2 with a demand from a miner that
Gorbachev and the entire leadership resign. The meeting hit its
emotional peak on Thursday when Yeltsin announced his resignation
from the 18-million member organization.
   At the close of the congress, delegates applauded Gorbachev's
statement that ``this is the end of the Cold War'' and that doors
were opening to the West.
   The decision of leaders of seven industrialized nations to
consider offering the Soviet Union economic aid, he said, showed
the success of his government's effort ``to overcome self-isolation
and become an integral part of the world economy.''
   Western leaders, meeting this week in Houston, Texas, resolved
to study giving economic aid to Moscow, as advocated by West
Germany and France.
   President Bush said Wednesday he would look more favorably on
helping the Soviet government if it would cut defense spending.
   Gorbachev told delegates: ``We are ready to cooperate and will
be grateful for assistance being not just seekers but partners who
are not going to take anything free.''
   ``I want to emphasize that I exclude all attempts to stipulate
any political conditions for such cooperation,'' Gorbachev said.
``It can and it must develop on an equal and mutually beneficial
grounds.''
   His comments were the highest-level Soviet response to the
Houston summit.
   In a surprise development, the largely traditionalist party
congress approved Gorbachev's plan to nearly double the size of the
Politburo to 23 members and give seats to the party leaders of the
15 Soviet republics.
   The Central Committee met late Friday night to choose Politburo
members, but no decision was made by early Saturday. The Politburo,
the party's highest body, was redesigned to ensure a moderate cast
and help reduce the ethnic tension that is ripping the country
apart.
   Restructuring the Politburo also marked a triumph in Gorbachev's
drive to shift power from the party to the government, which he
also heads. The Politburo appeared unlikely to meet frequently or
to seek control matters not dealing directly with the party.
   Gorbachev, smiling, relaxed and very much in control, warned the
delegates in his six-minute closing remarks of a ``gap between the
party committees and workers, peasants, and intellectuals.''
   He denounced those, who like, Yeltsin, ``demand repentence from
the party, settling scores, those who declare it even a criminal
organization, those who attempt by doing this to remove (the party)
from the political life of the country.''
   Gorbachev, in an interview with CBS News, said he didn't ``see
anything frightening'' in the prospect of a multiparty system
emerging in the Soviet Union.
   Summing up the results of the congress, Gorbachev said it did
not mark as some thought the death of the party, but rather ``the
rebirth and renewal of the Communist Party.''
   ``In spite of all the criticism ... all the delegates feel
certain that we're on the right course, and that reforms should
advance in all directions,'' he told CBS News.
   Yeltsin's theatrical announcement that he was quitting the
party, and statements by other reformers that they two were
leaving, signaled the first split in the party since factions were
formally banned in 1921.
   Besides Yeltsin, the reformist mayors of Moscow and Leningrad,
Gavriil Popov and Anatoly Sobchak, also announced they were
quitting the party, along with leaders of the radical Democratic
Platform.
   Equally worrisome from Gorbachev's perspective was a nationwide
warning strike Wednesday by miners who demanded that
nationalization of all party assets and a mass exodus of workers
from the party.
   Yeltsin, Sobchak and Popov have also indicated they would use
their government positions to divest the party of its billions of
rubles worth of publishing houses, office buildings, cars and
vacation resorts.
   Thousands of people have quit the party in recent months, and
the departure of the reform leaders and the rising anger of miners
and other workers appeared likely to accelerate that process. The
precise impact could not immediately be determined although it
cracked the unity among reformers that Gorbachev has been urging.

<TEXT>
   Jordan's foreign minister on Friday blamed
Israel for the slump in the U.S. drive to open Mideast neogtiations.
   Marwan al-Qasim also said after talking to Secretary of State
James A. Baker III that he hoped the United States would be dealing
with the Palestine Liberation Organization again.
   ``I hope that the suspension of the dialogue will not last too
long,'' the Arab official said.
   The Bush administration last month suspended its talks with the
PLO after Chairman Yasser Arafat took no action against Abul Abbas,
a member of the PLO executive council who was accused of plotting a
terrorist attack against Israel.
   Meanwhile, diplomatic sources said Baker hopes doctors will
permit Israeli foreign minister David Levy, who is recovering from
surgery, to come here for talks early next month.
   The U.S. drive came to a halt in March when Israel's cabinet
collapsed over Baker's formula for Israeli-Palestinian talks.
   Al-Qasim, blaming Israel, said, ``the efforts by the American
administration were derailed by Israel.''
   ``We hope there will be reconsideration, and have everyone
indulge in a meaningful dialgoue that would lead to the
comprehensive peace we need,'' he added.
   Jordan, after failing to persuade Israel to relinquish the West
Bank, decided two years ago to leave the area's future to the
Palestinians. But the foreign minister said Jordan always has been
interested in achieving a durable and just peace.
   ``We never went out of the circle and we continue to be in
that,'' he said.
   Jordan, like all Arab states, considers the PLO the sole
representative of Palestinians.
   ``We are trying to inject every possible idea that would keep
the peace process going and re-engage the Palestinians,'' Al-Qasim
said.

<TEXT>
   The nation's top welfare official on
Friday commended a Wisconsin experiment tying welfare benefits to
school attendance but cautioned officials to resolve the program's
administrative problems.
   U.S. Health and Social Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said
his office would continue to monitor the Learnfare program for
improvement but had already found the program's goals ``quite
laudable.''
   ``We feel that the data thus far merit continued investment in
the program,'' Sullivan said at a news conference.
   Learnfare, started in 1987, trims Aid to Families with Dependent
Children benefits to families whose teen-agers skip school. It has
been touted as an incentive for teen-agers to continue their
education and chances of employment, but harshly criticized by
welfare advocates.
   The program was ordered suspended in Milwaukee schools this week
by U.S. District Judge Terence Evans, who cited poor attendance
records that have resulted in some families being wrongly penalized.
   A lawsuit filed against the program said one family was evicted
from its home and others had to turn to food pantries for food.
   Evans' injunction applies only to the 3,200 teen-agers attending
Milwaukee Public Schools who have lost or are in danger of losing
AFDC benefits under Learnfare. The program continues in other parts
of the state.
   Penalties under Learnfare average about $100 a month for an
average family receiving $517 a month in benefits.
   Sullivan, who was in Marshfield to dedicate a new $6.1 million
research center at Marshfield Clinic, said he was not concerned by
the judge's action.
   ``Obviously, with any program that is new, there are always a
number of glitches or problems that might need to be addressed,''
he said. ``Clearly, the administrative issues must be addressed.''
   Despite criticism that Learnfare is a cruel and unsuccessful
anti-truancy tool, the federal government in June approved
Wisconsin's request to expand the program to include elementary
children.
   ``We have a number of problems that will be addressed by our
society if we can improve our education approach,'' Sullivan said.
   Dropout rates are as high as 50 percent in some inner-city
schools, he said.

   The Mohawk Indians said Friday that Quebec
has offered concessions to end their armed confrontation with
police. The dispute spread across Canada to British Columbia, where
Indians blocked roads to show support.
   Quebec's native affairs minister, John Ciaccia, arrived at the
barricades in a chauffeur-driven limousine Friday for the second
day of talks behind Mohawk lines. He told reporters Thursday's
talks ended on a positive note.
   On Wednesday, an officer was killed in a gun battle between
Mohawks and provincial police Wednesday arising from planned
construction of a golf course addition on what Mohawks say is
ancestral land. An investigation was to determine which side fired
the fatal bullet.
   The standoff and tight police security created problems on both
sides.
   After three days of living in a town under siege, residents
grumbled that this community of 3,000 people was running out of
supplies.
   Mohawks complained that police restricted access to Indian
territory and food, medicine and water were in short supply.
   Access to Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal, was so restricted that
even a truck delivering morning papers was turned back.
   Ciaccia said Friday, ``I think we have some basis for
negotiations and discussions and we will pursue them. We are taking
these negotiations one day at a time and it's too early to give
details on progress.''
   Other Mohawks, on the Kahnawake reserve south of Montreal,
blocked the Mercier Bridge in solidarity with their Oka brethren.
The span links the populous south shore of the St. Lawrence River
with the island of Montreal.
   Ellen Gabriel, Mohawk spokeswoman in Oka, said she warned
Ciaccia by phone that natives would blow up the bridge if police
attack.
   The dispute started four months ago when Mohawks built a
roadblock to prevent Oka from building an extension to a nine-hole
golf course on land the Mohawks say belongs to them.
   Early Wednesday, a provincial police raiding squad stormed the
barricade, setting off the gun battle that killed Cpl. Marcel
Lemay, 31.
   Members of the militant Warrior societies from Kahnawake and
from the Akwesasne reserve, south of Cornwall, Ontario, then
filtered into Oka to reinforce the Mohawk position. Police sent
reinforcements, and now total about 1,000 here.
   About 200 Mohawks stared down at police from the top of a hill.
   ``The police have to retreat completely from the area before we
can ever work out a deal with Ciaccia,'' Ms. Gabriel said.
   She said that on Thursday, ``Mr. Ciaccia gave us a message and
some details about some of the bargains that the governments want
to make with us.''
   She said Ciaccia discussed a possible guarantee that natives
involved in the occupation would not be prosecuted, another Mohawk
peacemaking condition.
   Just outside the town, young Indians drove cars and trucks at
high speed along a native-controlled stretch of Highway 344,
conveying news of police movements to other Mohawks and to
journalists.
   The Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs asked all native
bands in Canada's westernmost province to block roads and bridges
in their territories.
   Three roads were blocked for a time. An Indian chief, Marvin Bob
of the Pavilion band, was arrested, charged with public mischief
and released.
   Le Journal de Montreal said Friday that ballistics tests show
the bullet that killed Lemay was not the same type as those from
his service weapon or from the weapons of his colleagues. Montreal
police declined to comment.
   Ms. Gabriel said Ciaccia asked the natives to cooperate in the
police investigation of Lemay's death.
   ``We said yes,'' she said. `` We know we're innocent. We did not
cause the death.''
   A spokesman for Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said the federal
government is monitoring the standoff at Oka but considers it a
provincial dispute for now.

<HEAD>Music Group Threatens Boycott if Louisiana Labeling Bill Signed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The North American Concert Promoters
Association announced Friday it would cancel its New Orleans
convention this fall if the governor signs into law a bill
requiring labels on explicit records.
   Under the bill, which if signed by Gov. Buddy Roemer would be
the first state law of its type, records with lyrics some consider
offensive or obscene would be labelled and kept from minors.
   Carl Freed, director of the concert promotion group, said in a
statement from New York: ``If this bill becomes law, concert
promoters, recording artists and community retailers will be driven
out of business. They are being made scapegoats by soap box
politicians.''
   The bill now awaiting action from Roemer would require the
labeling of any recording that promotes or has as its central theme
illegal use of drugs and alcohol, violence, ritualistic acts or
certain kinds of sexual behavior.
   On Thursday, members of the music industry in Louisiana
suggested a voluntary labeling program to head off Roemer's
signature of the bill.
   ``Our plan is to have every record dealer in the state
voluntarily sign a pledge that they will not sell records with
explicit lyrics to minors,'' said Shea Dixon, backer of a proposed
Grammy Hall Of Fame for New Orleans. ``That's pretty much what's
being done now. This just formalizes it.''
   Record dealers said they have a standing policy of not selling
records that deal with sex, drugs or violence to minors.
   State Sen. William Jefferson, a Democrat, said the bill awaiting
Roemer's action is unconstitutional. Dealers said it's simply too
confusing to live with.
   The Record Industry Association Of America labeling system,
which took effect July 1, effectively singles out records with
explicit lyrics, said Freddie Szilagi, manager of Tower Records in
New Orleans.

<HEAD>Stones Cancel Two London Concerts Because of Richards Injury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rolling Stones canceled sellout concerts in
London on Friday and Saturday nights because lead guitarist Keith
Richards has an infected finger.
   Richards told reporters Friday he would ``absolutely'' be back
on stage for Saturday's concert at Wembley Stadium, but within
hours doctors decided his finger needed more time to heal. The
finger, pricked on the end of a guitar string, was injured during a
show last weekend at Wembley.
   ``Two physicians and a hand specialist have conferred and agreed
it would not be advisable for him to play for the next couple of
days,'' said tour publicist Jane Sen.
   Doctors warned Richards that playing for two hours at Friday
night's Wembley concert with his infected finger would cause it
serious damage. A concert Wednesday night in Cardiff, Wales, was
also canceled because of the injury.
   The Wembley concerts, where sellout crowds of 72,000 had been
expected, have been rescheduled for Aug. 24-25, Ms. Sen said.
   Dr. Michael Paul, who saw the star Friday afternoon, said: ``Mr.
Richards is suffering from an abcess on the left third finger,
which has spread to the rest of his finger and the lower part of
his hand.
   ``The condition is rapidly improving under antibiotics.''
   Speaking from a house in Wimbledon where he is staying during
the British leg of the Stones' Urban Jungle tour, Richards said:
``I stabbed it on the end of a guitar string at last weekend's show
at Wembley.''
   By Tuesday, he said, ``it had swollen up like a football'' and
Wednesday night's concert in Cardiff was canceled. It has been
rescheduled for Monday.
   ``It's the first show I've ever missed in 27 years. It's like
I've blotted my copy book,'' the guitarist said.
   After a week on antibiotics and off alcohol, he said, the
swelling was going down.
   The tour is scheduled to end in August with concerts in Prague,
Czechoslovakia, and East Berlin.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixty rare Audubon prints and two by Goya
were stolen from the state museum, and police issued an arrest
warrant Friday for a volunteer who allegedly carried them out past
the guards, officials said.
   The stolen prints were brokered through dealers and ended up in
France, Canada, Chicago, Philadelphia and New York, state police
Capt. Ronnie Jones said. Officials said they did not know how much
the prints brought, but it was estimated maybe as much as $2
million.
   All but one of the Audubons have been located, Jones said. The
dealers apparently were unaware the prints were stolen, and have
cooperated with police efforts to get them back.
   Museum director James Sefcik said other prints are also missing,
but the list is still being compiled because there is no accurate
record of total museum holdings. Two of the missing prints were by
Goya.
   Michael Moskaluk, a 43-year-old volunteer at the museum, is
sought in the thefts, which took place at the Presbytere branch of
the museum, in the French Quarter.
   Moskaluk had five previous felony convictions, including art
theft, and served time in federal and state prison in
Massachusetts, Jones said.
   Sefcik said the thefts were discovered by the museum's curator
nearly a month ago when other prints were returned to storage after
an exhibition of Audubon's Louisiana birds. The theft was kept
secret until Friday while state police investigated.
   The stolen prints were apparently taken past guards during the
transfer of other museum material, Sefcik said.
   The Audobon prints were part of a complete set of 425 acquired
by the museum 150 years ago, shortly after John James Audubon
finished the so-called elephant folio of 2 feet-by-3 feet prints.

<HEAD>Attorney General's Office Takes Umbrage at Accused Officer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney general's office
on Friday expressed amazement that a high-ranking officer accused
of covering up the massacre of six Jesuit priests has not been
arraigned.
   An arrest warrant was issued June 26 for the officer, who
remained in command of an elite infantry battalion until at least
July 5, when the military said he was placed under arrest.
   Court sources said military authorities were obliged by law to
take Lt. Col. Camilo Hernandez before 4th Criminal Court Judge
Ricardo Zamora as soon as he was arrested.
   ``We're amazed that several days after Hernandez' detention, he
still has not been brought before the judge,'' said Edward Blanco,
an assistant attorney general.
   Army troops have admitted killing six Jesuit priest-educators,
their housekeeper and her daughter last Nov. 16. A colonel, three
lieutenants and five soldiers have been charged with murder.
   Zamora ordered Hernandez' arrest because of testimony alleging
the officer ordered the burning of military log books that could
have shed light on the crime.
   The delays in arresting Hernandez and in taking him before the
judge for arraignment come despite repeated avowals from Defense
Minister Gen. Humberto Larios of the military's complete
collaboration with the investigation into the Jesuit massacre.
   Asked why Hernandez, who the armed forces say is under arrest at
the National Guard headquarters, has not been taken before the
judge, military spokesman Maj. Mauricio Chavez Caceres responded:
``I don't know.''
   Local Jesuit and church authorities contend high-ranking
military authorities are engaged in a cover-up designed to protect
the ``intellectual authors'' of the killings.
   U.S. legislators intend to condition part of next year's
military aid to El Salvador on successful investigation and
prosecution of the priests' murderers.

<TEXT>
   Naga and Wanita, a pair of giant, flesh-eating
Komodo dragons from Indonesia, inspired a burst of affection from
their keeper Friday as he prepared for their weekend debut at the
Cincinnati Zoo.
   ``Naga!'' Cincinnati Zoo reptile supervisor Johnny Arnett
shouted at the seven-foot-long, 120-pound male lizard staring back
at him through the glass wall of his custom-built cage.
   ``I love them. That's the sexiest lizard in the world right
there,'' Arnett said, whistling at Naga.
   The gray-green Komodo dragons, a gift from Indonesian President
Suharto to President Bush, are the second set in the United States.
The first pair live at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. Arnett
said the Singapore Zoo has the only other set of Komodo dragons
outside Indonesia.
   The Indonesian ambassador to the United States, Adbul Rachman
Ramly, arrived Friday for a reception to celebrate the opening of
the permanent display here.
   The 10-by-40-foot cage includes a bathtub-size pool of water, as
well as plants and a painted backdrop based on photographs Arnett
took on tropical Komodo Island, the home of the reptiles, when he
visited Indonesia to bring back Naga and Wanita. The lizards also
have an outdoor display.
   ``They're 7 years old, so they have some growing to do. When
they're full size, they should be nine feet long and about 175
pounds,'' Arnett said.
   Naga, whose slender tail makes up half his length, crawled
around his cage Friday on his stocky legs, lifting his head and
flicking his six-inch forked tongue. Wanita remained in a den to
one side.
   ``She's not hiding from us as much as she's hiding from him,''
Arnett said, explaining that the behavior indicates the female is
carrying eggs she wants to protect.
   ``If she lays those eggs, and if we get them, we will be the
first zoo in the Western Hemisphere to breed them in captivity,''
Arnett said.
   David and Tracy Barker, who raise rare pythons in Baltimore for
sale to zoos, said they traveled to Cincinnati for the opening of
the lizard display.
   ``He is beautiful. He is absolutely perfect,'' David Barker
said, gazing at Naga with a smile on his face.
   ``We fantasize about seeing the babies born, that's what it
is,'' Tracy Barker said. ``That would be amazing.''
   In the wild, Komodo dragons usually eat rotting flesh scavenged
from the carcasses of dead animals, but are fast runners if they
choose to hunt live game, Arnett said.
   ``They've been known to walk down the street in a village going
after dogs and such,'' he said.
   The zoo plans to limit their menu to goat, chicken, and the
occasional rodent left over from feeding snakes.
   ``It's very hard to give them a rotted carcass. It's disgusting
to the public and it's disgusting to me,'' Arnett said.

<TEXT>
   A jury conducting an inquest into the
deaths of five children in a housing complex fire ruled Friday that
no criminal charges should be filed against police, firefighters,
or the child's mother.
   The Dane County Circuit Court jury determined there was no
criminal negligence in the children's deaths March 13 at the
Somerset Apartments. It noted that testimony in the case was
contradictory.
   The fire, which started on a kitchen stove burner, killed
Derrick Robinson, 9; Kenneth Jones, 5; Eboni Jones, 2; Cynthia
Jones, 1, and Mark Jones, 5 months.
   Some residents of the complex testified police and fire
officials were callous about the lives of poor black children and
did not attempt an immediate rescue although the childrens' screams
could be heard outside the building.
   Some also claimed police prevented citizens from entering the
burning building to try to rescue the children and one officer used
a flashlight to beat back a man attempting a rescue.
   Police and firefighters testified they refused to allow rescue
attempts because they feared further loss of life.
   Authorities testified they had difficulty locating Cheryl
Robinson, the mother of the five, and were uncertain if she was
home when the fire broke out. Residents, however, testified they
saw Ms. Robinson flee the burning building and plead for someone to
rescue her children.
   ``I'm surprised the descrepancies seem even greater now after
four days of testimony,'' District Attorney William Foust said.

   Patriarch Dimitrios, the spiritual leader of 250
million Orthodox Christians, stepped off a train at Penn Station on
Friday and was welcomed by several hundred flag-waving faithful.
   ``As a spiritual leader and as a free man, I am deeply moved
that God has enabled me to visit beautiful New York City for the
first time,'' said Dimitrios, the first Orthodox patriarch to visit
the United States.
   Mayor David Dinkins greeted Dimitrios by noting the growing role
of the Orthodox Church in Eastern Europe. Orthodox leaders here, he
said, ``are now in a position to assist in the grand task of
regenerating the church in their homelands.''
   Most of the church's 250 million members live in Eastern Europe,
but 6 million Orthodox Christians live in the United States,
including 1 million in the New York area, according to the Greek
Orthodox Archdiocese.
   Dimitrios, who arrived on a special train from Washington, was
greeted by a brass band and several hundred men, women and children
waving flags with the patriarch's white seal.
   ``It was a very proud moment,'' said Katina Mihaltses, who
immigrated from Cyprus in 1956. ``The moment I saw him I felt like
crying. My eyes were full of tears.''
   Dimitrios, speaking through an interpreter, praised New York
City as representing ``the model of a multi-racial society made up
of a host of different races, nationalities, traditions and
religions all joined in a coherent whole, united by common ideas of
humanity and international solidarity.''
   The 75-year-old religious leader was in Washington for a week to
attend the 30th Greek Orthodox Biennial Clergy-Laity Congress. He
will spend five days in the New York metropolitan area. Other stops
on his tour will be in Pennsylvania, San Francisco, Chicago,
Buffalo and Boston.
   Ecumenical Patriarch Dimitrios I, installed in 1972, holds the
title Archbishop of Constantinople. His domain includes the
Albanian, Bulgarian, Czechoslovakian, Georgian, Greek, Polish,
Romanian, Russian and Ukrainian Orthodox churches.
   Dimitrios lives and works in Istanbul, Turkey, known as
Constantinople when it was capital of the Byzantine Empire.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa broke his

in northern Poland, state television said Friday.
   The accident occurred during Walesa's annual summer vacation in
the Kaszubian Lakes region, where he has a cabin. There were
contradictory versions of how it happened.
   The state television report said Walesa fell from a ladder
Thursday, breaking his right arm. It gave no further details.
   A source close to the Solidarity leaders's office in Gdansk said
he was told Walesa was injured in a traffic mishap Tuesday, while
driving his van which was loaded with lumber for cabin repairs. The
van reportedly slid into a ditch on an uneven dirt road, the source
said.
   Walesa himself could not be reached for comment. His cabin has

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government has notified Eastern
Airlines that it will be charged with criminal violations for
allegedly altering maintenance and safety records before last
year's strike, NBC News reported Friday.
   Quoting unidentified sources close to Eastern, NBC reported that
the airline is considering whether to plead guilty or no contest.
   A federal grand jury conducted a 10-month investigation into
charges that Eastern altered the records at New York's Kennedy and
La Guardia airports and at the Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta,
Eastern's major hub.
   Eastern managers at Kennedy and LaGuardia allegedly ordered
mechanics to disregard safety guidelines and then falsified
logbooks to show that proper checks had been made, the report said.
   If criminal charges are filed, it will be the first time an
airline has faced such charges over maintenance practices.
   In the past, airlines have been fined by the Federal Aviation
Administration for bad maintenance.
   Eastern's bankruptcy trustee, Martin R. Shugrue, told NBC he had
discussed the investigation with the prosecutor, U.S. Attorney
Andrew J. Maloney.
   ``He sought my cooperation as trustee,'' Shugrue said. ``I
pledged it to him, and the investigation is ongoing.''
   The network said Eastern's lawyers plan to meet with the
prosecutor Monday to say whether they'll fight the charges.
   Maloney would not comment on the case, and there was no answer
at Eastern's offices in Miami Friday evening.
   Shugrue was appointed trustee to run Eastern as Frank Lorenzo's
replacement as the airline tries to pull itself out of bankruptcy
proceedings.
   Machinists at Eastern have been on strike since March 1989.

<TEXT>
   A grand jury Friday indicted a jailed
rapist on murder charges in the slayings of at least six young
women and teen-agers whose bodies were found in the desert three
years ago.
   But while some relatives of the victims were pleased, others
thought authorities might be just finding a scapegoat.
   David Leonard Wood of El Paso was charged after new evidence was
presented to a grand jury, although prosecutors would not
elaborate. He is serving a 50-year prison term for a 1987 rape.
   The decayed remains of the victims, 14 to 23 years old, were
found in the desert about 18 miles northeast of El Paso between
Sept. 4, 1987 and March 14, 1988.
   Each of the victims had been missing at least two months before
the body was discovered. All were buried in shallow graves within a
half-mile of each other. Three people are still missing.
   The discovery led to an intensive investigation and the
formation of a special task force that has dwindled to two members.
   ``This investigation has gone on practically three years and a
lot of my staff's been involved and a great number of officers and
other agencies have been involved,'' said District Attorney Steve
Simmons. ``We're certainly relieved that in a crime like this the
subject can be brought to justice.''
   ``Oh, I'm real happy right now,'' said Marcia Wheatley, the
mother of Desiree Wheatley, whose remains were found Oct. 20, 1987.
   But Erika Dismukes, mother of Cheryl Lynn Vasquez Dismukes, who
has been missing since she was 19, said she was angry that Wood was
indicted. ``David had nothing to do with it. Maybe he knows
something but he had nothing to do with it,'' Mrs. Dismukes said.
   Mona Dismukes, the missing woman's sister-in-law, also was
angry. ``They don't know who else to blame,'' she said.
   Wood knew Cheryl Lynn and at least one of the confirmed victims.
The Dismukes family has conducted its own investigations into the
murders and disappearances and believes Wood is innocent, Erika
Dismukes said.
   The indictment says one victim was stabbed several times with a
sharp instrument and the others were killed ``by some means,
instrument or weapon, unknown to the grand jury.''
   Under Texas' serial murder law, Wood faces life in prison or
execution by injection if he's convicted.
   Some of the victims were runaways or prostitutes, and police
were criticized for not responding more quickly to reports of their
disappearances.
   Wood, who was convicted in March 1988 of the rape, had been
mentioned before as a suspect. Last year, he filed a $20.5 million
lawsuit against Police Chief John Scagno, claiming police schemed
to implicate him because they could not solve the case.

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out Warrant for Arrest of Reputed Duvalierist</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A judge dismissed a warrant for the
arrest of Roger Lafontant, a former high official of the Duvalier
dictatorship whose return from exile prompted a nationwide protest
strike, radio stations said Friday.
   Magistrate Justin Fougere acted after government prosecutor
Bayard Vincent showed up in court Thursday to defend the warrant,
but left before the judge arrived, after waiting for him for more
than an hour, independent Radio Haiti Inter reported.
   Fougere declared the arrest warrant null and void because of
Vincednt's absence, the report said.
   In an interview Friday with Radio Antilles, another independent
station, Vincent protested Fougere's decision and accused the
Justice Department and police of complicity in obstructing justice.
   Vincent issued an arrest warrant for Lafontant last Saturday,
the day Lafontant returned after more than four years in exile in
the neighboring Dominican Republic.
   The return from exile of Lafontant and retired Maj. Gen.
Williams Regala was widely regarded as an attempt by Duvalier
loyalists to disrupt general elections scheduled for Nov. 4.
   Foreign Minister Kesler Clermont told a news conference at the
United Nations that the Haitian government was seeking about 345
U.N. observers to ensure free and fair elections in November. But
he admitted a consensus by the 15-member Security Council was
unlikely and the issue was expected to be taken up by the General
Assembly on July 23.
   Past elections in Haiti have been marred by bloodshed and
violence, but the strife has been entirely domestic.
   Opponents of Security Council involvement say U.N. intervention
could set an unfortunate precedent for handling other domestic
disputes.
   Political and union leaders organized a nationwide one-day
protest strike here Wednesday after President Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot failed to meet its demand to arrest Lafontant and
Regala, who returned separately from exile last week.

   A judge on Friday dismissed a murder charge
against a veterinarian who slammed his newborn son against a
delivery room floor seven years ago after realizing the boy had
birth defects.
   Daniel McKay had been tried twice on the murder charges. Both
trials ended in hung juries.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Will Gierach on Friday ruled there
wasn't enough evidence against McKay to sustain the charge of
murder in the 1983 slaying in this south Chicago suburb.
   ``There will be no more trial, it's over, it's done,'' said
McKay's attorney Jo-Anne Wolfson. She said the state cannot bring
her client to trial on a lesser charge.
   McKay and his wife, Carol, broke into tears when the judge made
his ruling, Ms. Wolfson said.
   McKay slammed his infant son to the delivery room floor moments
after the boy was born with a cleft palate, a harelip and webbed
fingers.
   His attorneys claimed that the child's terrible condition had
driven McKay into a state of temporary insanity. The state argued
the deformities did not excuse the killing.
   ``Baby McKay did not deserve the fate he met,'' Raymond Garza,
an assistant state's attorney, argued at one point in the
proceedings. ``He was not such a horrible creature that his life
deserved to be snuffed out.''
   After the two hung juries, the defense moved in November 1987
that the charge be dismissed. Judge Gierach granted the motion in
January 1988, but the state appealed. The appeals court returned
the case to Gierach on a technicality.
   The judge's final dismissal on Friday left McKay, who practices
veterinary medicine in Beecher, ``absolutely ecstatic,'' said his
attorney.
   The McKays have one child, Amy, 14.

   Army Gen. Alexei D. Lizichev, the political
commissar of the Soviet armed forces, has been relieved of his
duties at his request for health reasons, the state news agency
Tass reported Friday.
   He was replaced by his senior deputy, Col. Gen. Nikolai Shlyaga,
Tass quoted a Defense Ministry statement as saying.
   Lizichev, 62, was appointed to his post shortly after Mikhail S.
Gorbachev came to power in 1985. He has been assigned to the group
of inspectors-general at the ministry, Tass said.
   The job's formal title is chief of the main political
directorate of the Soviet army and navy, the head of the system of
commissars that oversee the loyalty of the armed forces to the
Communist Party.
   Radical reformers want to obliterate the system of communist
control in the armed forces and the KGB security police.
   Lizichev was dropped Thursday from the list of nominees to the
Communist Party's Central Committee, and his place on the
policy-making body was taken by Shlyaga.
   Col. Gen. Viktor F. Yermakov was put in charge of the main
personnel department of the Defense Ministry, replacing Gen. Dmitry
S. Sukhorukov, 67, who also was relieved for health reasons, Tass
said. Sukhorukov also was assigned to the inspectors-general's
office.

   A scent squad has been unleashed in
Bartlesville to trace and identify an elusive odor that has plagued
residents in the western part of town for months.
   The 19-member Bartlesville Odor Mitigation Task Force will
distribute about a half-dozen devices to trap the smell, which then
will be sniffed and characterized by select noses at a Chicago
research company, officials say.
   The IIT Research Institute will try to match the descriptions
with a smell that could be produced in the Bartlesville area, said
Demetrio Moschandreas of the Chicago-based institute.
   The city has received 60 calls since Jan. 1 about the smells,
but has been unable to determine the cause, said Barbara Hachmuth,
superintendent of the city waste water management department.
   After dozens of reports of a smell likened to rotten eggs or
butane, an energy-research institute operated by IIT in
Bartlesville went to work.
   Linda McGrew, spokeswoman for the National Institute for
Petroleum and Energy Research, said the task force will gather
reports of the odor and plot them on a city map.
   She said odor-collection devices will be scattered in
neighborhoods in this city of 35,000 about 40 miles north of Tulsa
in northeastern Oklahoma, and volunteers will snag samples to be
shipped to Chicago.
   ``You press a button and it will suck in the air and put it in a
hermetically sealed bag,'' Ms. McGrew said of the devices.
   In Chicago, panel members will take a whiff of the contents and
describe what they smell. Moschandreas said the panel has a list of
144 words or phrases to describe the smell, such as fried chicken,
leather, alcohol, chemicals, soap and sour milk.
   Scientists at the institute will review the descriptions to see
if they match any odors that could be produced in the area.

Teachers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 5,000 teachers jeered Gov. Booth Gardner
outside a hotel Friday where he was elected chairman of a national
education reform group.
   Gardner, who bills himself as ``the education governor,'' said
he was neither embarrassed nor moved by protest, which wasn't
audible inside the Westin Hotel, where the Education Commission of
the States held its annual meeting.
   ``It's their show and this is my show; we're both doing what we
have to do,'' he said.
   Gardner has been at loggerheads with the teachers since
February, when they staged a one-day walkout to protest his refusal
to use part of a $750 million state revenue windfall to boost
teachers' pay hikes.
   Gardner was speaking Friday before about 800 people from the
commission, a reform group that includes governors, lawmakers and
education leaders from every state but Montana.
   ``We need to rethink public education from the ground up,'' he
said. ``What's missing is a clear vision of how our nation's entire
educational system _ from Head Start to Harvard _ can be redirected
to serve the needs of the future rather than the needs of the
past.''
   Gardner has promoted innovative teaching programs in the state
and free pre-school for disadvantaged 4-year-olds. He has promised
to sponsor across-the-board pay boosts for teachers next winter but
wants some of the pay package to be linked to performance, which
the teachers' union opposes.
   The protest march Friday was one the larger ones in recent
memory in Seattle.
   The throng was estimated by police at between 5,000 and 6,000,
at 12,000 by National Education Association President Keith Geiger.
The teachers complained that Congress and state legislators weren't
committing their checkbooks to education.
   The protest theme _ ``No More Hot Air'' _ was emblazoned across
the front of a huge hot air balloon.
   Washington Education Association president Carla Nuxoll, a
teacher from the Spokane area, said Gardner is heralded as an
educational leader everywhere but in his home state.
   ``A true `education governor' must do more than just puff about
his commitment to education,'' Nuxoll said. ``I can assure you that
there is far more hot air inside this hotel than we have outside
right now.'''
   ``He'd get an `A' in speechmaking, but an `F' when the
assignment comes due,'' said Katrina Dohn, a fifth grade teacher in
Tukwila, south of Seattle.
   Washington's class sizes are the fifth largest in the nation.
Textbook and per-pupil spending are below the national average, and
teacher salaries have dropped from fourth in the nation to 23rd in
the past decade, Nuxoll said.
   The education commission's outgoing chairman is New Mexico Gov.
Garrey Carruthers. Maine Gov. John McKernan was tapped as
chairman-elect.

Drownings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Haitian exile leaders on Friday called
for investigations into the drownings of 39 Haitians whose
overloaded sailboat capsized while being towed by Bahamian
authorities.
   Exiles also questioned the Bahamian government's decision to
bury the dead in a mass grave on an uninhabited key.
   The circumstances surrounding the drownings ``seem quite
questionable and demands an official explanation'' into whether
officers of the Bahamian Defense Force were negligent in the
accident, said Eliezer Regnier, a lawyer and human rights activist
in the Bahamas.
   ``The fact that the deaths occurred while these people were in
official custody of the defense force all the more warrants more
explanation than what was given by the official press release of
the government,'' Regnier said.
   Another 67 Haitians pitched into the sea when the sailboat
rolled over Wednesday were rescued by those aboard the Bahamas
Defense Force patrol boat.
   ``No one should treat his or his own brothers and sisters this
way,'' said the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, a Haitian exile leader in
Miami, who also urged an investigation. ``This is shameful.''
   The bodies of 30 men and nine women were buried in a mass grave
Wednesday at uninhabited Bitter Guana Cay in the Exumas, about 80
miles from Nassau, according to the government.
   ``Although the people are poor and may have been trespassing in
another jurisdiction, there ought to have been some dignity given
them. There need not have been a mass burial'' said Regnier, a
Haitian-born Bahamian.
   The statement said the boat was chased by the Bahamian Defense
Force vessel Yellow Elder after it was spotted off Staniel Cay,
about 200 miles southeast of the southern tip of Florida near Great
Exuma island.
   The sloop tried to enter shallow waters before it was overtaken
and put under tow by the Yellow Elder, the government said. During
the tow back to Staniel Cay, the sloop capsized.
   The survivors were brought Wednesday to Nassau. In almost all
cases, Haitians intercepted while fleeing their homeland for the
United States are returned home.
   U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Jeff Karonis said Friday that 537 Haitians
have been picked up so far this year in the waters off Florida as
they attempt to leave their Caribbean island. Earlier this week,
193 Haitians were picked up from a 40-foot boot.
   ``There's always the potential for a tragedy,'' he said about
the dangerous crossing in vessels that may be overloaded or
unseaworthy.

<DATELINE>BRINDISI, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of weary Albanians trudged from
ferry boats onto Italian shores Friday, realizing a dream that had
led them to besiege foreign embassies in Europe's last citadel of
hard-line Communism.
   ``We shall win!'' refugees on one ferry chanted in Italian as
they approached the port of Brindisi.
   Albania's state ATA news agency meanwhile reported that about
100,000 Albanians rallied on Friday in Skanderbeg Square, near
Tirana's diplomatic quarter, in support of the country's Communist
leadership.
   Xhelil Gjoni, a member of the party's policy-making Politburo,
told the rally that ``Albania and its people's power are unshaken
by degenerate people who abandon their homeland or by anyone
else,'' said a Tirana Radio broadcast, monitored in London.
   The four ships, chartered by the West German and Italian
governments, picked up about 4,500 Albanians in Durres early Friday
under an agreement worked out with United Nations mediation.
   After journeys of about seven hours, the ferries disgorged
crowds of ragged, sweaty Albanians onto the Brindisi docks, where
they were met by Red Cross workers and soldiers serving warm milk
and cold soda.
   ``I am very, very happy to come here,'' said Artano Harizai, 25,
as he and three friends examined plastic relief bags filled with
new socks and shirts.
   ``Here and in Europe there's freedom. In Albania there's not.''
   His friends, one without shoes and another shirtless, nodded
vigorously and gave thumbs-down signs for the Albanian police.
   Fifteen Albanians were admitted to Brindisi's hospital,
including two women expected to give birth soon, said Red Cross
spokesman Ricardo Moro. Several other people were suffering from
wounds suffered when Albanian police fired at people trying to
scamble into Western embassies.
   A baby was born on one ship, the Espresso Grecia, after it left
Albania, a Red Cross spokesman said.
   About 3,200 refugees were from West Germany's Embassy, and they
boarded trains at the dock to continue to that country.
   ``Everyone off to freedom!'' a refugee cried to other Albanians
waving from a departing train.
   A fifth ferry, chartered by the French government, took on 545
Albanians for a voyage from Durres directly to Marseille.
   About 800 Albanians from Italy's embassy were taken by bus to a
temporary camp outside Brindisi, and 29 refugees from Greece's
embassy took a plane from Brindisi to Athens, said Clara Minerva,
assistant director of the local Interior Ministry office.
   The evacuation eased a crisis that prompted dismissals from the
Albanian government and damaged its efforts to soften its
isolationist foreign policy.
   Albanian leader Ramiz Alia introduced limited reforms this year,
including some religious freedom and travel abroad.
   But that was not enough for the thousands of Albanians who
sought refuge in foreign embassies in Tirana.
   Many predicted Albania's Communist government would fall, just
as the East German government did last year after thousands of its
citizens crowded foreign embassies to flee to the West.
   ``Many people are unhappy in Albania. They are with us,'' said a
mining engineer who identified himself as Muharrem.
   Several people put on chains with crosses given to them by
Italians at the dock. Until recently religious observances were
forbidden in Albania.
   Several Albanians admitted to having had trouble with the
government either because of criticizing it or having relatives who
tried to escape from the country.
   Others said they had always dreamed of freedom or wanted a
better life.
   ``We haven't a need for food,'' Muharrem said in broken English.
``We have the need for freedom of ideas.''
   Many people said they hoped to eventually make it to the United
States, where, as 21-year-old Voltan Rexhepi said: ``Life is good.''
   Rexhepi said he spent the last five days squeezed into the West
German Embassy. Albanian authorities frequently cut off the water
and toilets became unusable, but the diplomats struggled to provide
food for all 3,200, he and others said.
   The Albanians were transported by bus late Thursday from Tirana
to Durres, where they boarded the ferries, they said. Police ringed
the dock to prevent anyone else from jumping aboard, ferry crew
members said.
   Durres is about 85 miles from Brindisi.
   Until Friday, only 51 of the asylum-seekers crammed into
embassies had left Albania. The small group flew to Prague,
Czechoslovakia, on Tuesday.
   Arrangements were made to fly 40 Albanians who had taken refuge
in the Hungarian embassy to Budapest.
   As some Albanians left the ferries at Brindisi, they gaily waved
their new red passports, their ticket to a new life.
   The Albanian government agreed to let the refugees leave after
supplies of food and medicine in the embassies ran low and hygienic
conditions deteriorated.
   The Foreign Ministry in Bonn said its embassy had been closed
for renovations.
   ``The embassy is in an inconceivable state,'' said spokesman
Juergen Chrobog.

<HEAD>Embattled Minister Back in London, Expected To Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's beleaguered trade secretary, Nicholas
Ridley, came home Friday night from a trade visit to Hungary and
expectations were he will resign after his charge that West Germany
wanted to take over a united Europe.
   His comments in a magazine interview, which he later retracted,
provoked cross-party calls for his resignation and were denounced
in Germany, France and other European countries.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refused Friday to answer
questions about Ridley's political future, reportedly leaving the
first move up to him.
   But even rank-and-file members of her Conservative Party, who
applaud his warning of German supremacy over a united Europe, said
he will have to go. Sir Marcus Fox, vice chairman of the 1922
Committee of Tory lawmakers, told BBC Radio 4 that Ridley's
position was now ``very bad.''
   Mrs. Thatcher told the House of Commons on Thursday that Ridley
was not reflecting government policy, nor her own views, but she
rejected demands for his dismissal.
   Ridley, 61, the outspoken and controversial son of Viscount
Ridley, is considered Mrs. Thatcher's closest ideological ally in
the Cabinet. Political commentators said his departure would be a
blow to her.
   In the interview with the conservative weekly, the Spectator,
Ridley said the West German government's support for European
monetary union ``is all a German racket designed to take over the
whole of Europe. It has to be thwarted.
   ``This rushed take-over by the Germans on the worst possible
basis, with the French behaving like poodles to the Germans, is
absolutely intolerable.''
   Ridley said he opposed yielding sovereignty to the 12-nation
European Community, which he said was run by ``17 unelected reject
politicians.'' He said: ``You might just as well give it to Adolf
Hitler, frankly.''
   Earlier Friday night, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd made the
government's first move to repair the damage to Anglo-European
relations.
   Speaking at the Anglo-American conference center near Oxford,
Hurd said: ``Our alliance, our partnership and our friendship with
France and Germany lie at the heart of modern British foreign
policy.
   ``Lingering memories from the past do not prevent us from
strengthening, month by month, the practical proofs of that
friendship.
   ``Irreversible also is the steadily increasing cooperation with
the fellow members and institutions of the European Community of
which the prime minister spoke after the Dublin (EEC) summit (last
month).
   ``Nothing will now put these processes in doubt.''
   Paddy Ashdown, leader of the centrist Liberal Democratic Party,
said: ``The issue has now become not Mr. Ridley's folly but Mrs.
Thatcher's judgment. By refusing to sack him, she is multiplying
the insult of his outrageous views.''
   Gordon Brown, the opposition Labor Party's trade spokesman, said
she was guilty of a ``dismal failure of leadership'' for leaving
the decision about Ridley's future in his hands.
   ``With this indecision following on top of the Ridley insults,
her inaction today signifies an astonishing abdication of
responsibility that will make Britain the subject of, at best,
ridicule, and at worst, hostility throughout Europe,'' he said.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Orders Moody Detained; Sets Trial Date</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MACON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday ordered a man who
has been the focus of a probe into fatal mail bombings held without
bail until his trial on unrelated charges of witness tampering.
   Judge Wilbur D. Owens Jr. set a tentative trial date of Sept. 17
for Walter Leroy Moody Jr., 56. He also ruled that Moody's wife,
Susan McBride Moody, 28, could be released on a $250,000 property
bond.
   The Moodys were arrested Tuesday and charged in a 13-count
federal indictment with conspiracy, obstruction of justice,
subornation of perjury, bribery of a witness and tampering with a
witness.
   The charges arose from Moody's attempts to erase a 1972
conviction for possession of a pipe bomb in Macon. The bomb injured
his then-wife Hazel.
   Thursday's session of the bail hearing featured secretly
videotaped meetings in March and April between the Moodys and Julie
Linn West of Atlanta. The government contends she was one of two
women the Moodys bribed and intimidated into providing Moody with a
concocted alibi for the bombing.
   The materials used in the pipe bomb explosion reportedly were
similar to those found in four December mail bombs, two of which
killed a federal judge and a lawyer in December.
   At one point Friday, Owens closed the hearing after a
prosecutors mentioned the mail bombings that killed 11th Circuit
Court Judge Robert S. Vance and Savannah lawyer Robert Robinson.
The other bombs went to the 11th Circuit courthouse and to the
Jacksonville, Fla., office of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   Letters that claimed responsibility for the mail bombs
attributed them to a racist hate group.
   Bruce Harvey, Moody's attorney, has claimed that the indictment
was a consolation prize for prosecutors who have been unable to
indict Moody in the mail bombings despite six months of
investigation.
   After an hourlong close hearing with Harvey and prosecutors,
Owen returned to open court and ruled that attorneys in the Moodys'
current trial could not discuss potential evidence in the mail
bombings case.
   ``The charges in this court do not involve the bombings the
government has mentioned,'' Owens said, noting neither Moody nor
his wife has been indicted in the bombings. ``When and if they are
indicted, that is a matter that will be taken up.''

   Members of a reformist bloc in the Communist Party
say they will follow the lead of maverick Boris N. Yeltsin and quit
the party in what would be the first such split since the time of

   The dramatic events came Thursday as Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev was wrapping up a personally victorious 28th party
congress with the last major task: electing a new policy-making
Central Committee.
   Delegates began voting by secret ballot this morning, the
official Tass news agency said. About 420 candidates were running
for the committee, which in its last form had 250 members but may
be modified.
   After the vote, delegates will conclude debates on the new party
rules and adjourn after hearing a report by Gorbachev summing up

   The Senate takes up the Americans with Disabilities Act today

   Discovery of the gene linked to the Elephant
Man's disease may be too late to help Porter Colley, but the
Massachusetts woman whose tumor-covered face is a mark of the
disease says that, at last, there is hope.
   Ms. Colley, speaking Thursday at a news conference with
researchers who have isolated the disease gene, said the most
wrenching part of being one of 100,000 Americans with
neurofibromatosis was the bleak sense that nothing could be done.
   The discovery of the neurofibromatosis, or NF, gene changes all
that and raises, for the first time, the possibility that the
untreatable disorder may eventually be understood and controlled.
   ``The most painful feeling has been that there was no hope for
progress in NF research,'' she said, television lights glinting off
the globular masses scarring her face. ``It was almost as if people
with NF had been singled out for a particularly cruel life.''

   Republicans, stung by Democratic attacks over the
savings and loan crisis, are promising to get their party back on
the offensive _ even when it comes to discussing President Bush's
reversal on taxes.
   ``Don't get defensive,'' GOP pollster Bob Teeter told the
Republican National Committee on Thursday. ``It is the single
greatest mistake I think we could make.''
   Teeter, voicing publicly what many GOP leaders are mumbling
about privately, said Bush's decision to ditch his ``no new taxes''
pledge could hurt Republicans in the short term.
   But he told the party leaders that Bush had to make the
concession to win a promise of spending cuts from the Democrats
controlling Congress _ and that the GOP will quickly rebound if
Bush negotiates a significant deficit reduction plan.
   ``A good economy is good politics,'' Teeter said. ``There is no
worse politics than a recession.''

   Evan Mecham can run for governor again this fall
despite being impeached and removed from the office in 1988,
Arizona's Supreme Court ruled.
   Voters, not the courts, should decide whether the former
governor is worthy of holding public office again, the state's
highest court ruled Thursday in unanimously rejecting a challenge
to Mecham's comeback bid.
   ``Impeachment, essentially a political process, is not subject
to judicial review,'' the justices said. ``Any appeal from the
impeachment conviction lies in the electoral process.''
   Mecham was convicted by the state Senate of misusing about
$80,000 given him by supporters and trying to thwart an
investigation of an alleged death threat against an aide.
   He is one of five candidates seeking the Republican nomination
in the Sept. 11 primary.

   Fundamentalists have won a round
against secularism, slipping a bill on Islamic law through the
Senate while the government wasn't looking, and liberal Pakistanis
worry about what lies ahead.
   Critics of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto say she was
outmaneouvered. The few senators belonging to her left-of-center
Pakistan People's Party, including her law minister, were absent
when the bill passed unanimously in May.
   Her government, the first in a modern Islamic nation led by a
woman, is expected to stall until the Senate elections of March
1991 in hopes of winning control of the chamber. The Pakistan
People's Party controls the National Assembly, where the real power
lies.
   ``It's depressed me immensely,'' Amna Piracha, a friend of Ms.
Bhutto and a National Assembly member, said of the Senate action.
She added, however: ``There are many ways we can tackle it.''
   Opponents of the Sharia Bill fear the power it will give Islamic
clerics, who would interpret law according to their reading of the
Koran, the Moslem holy book. Sharia is the term used for Islamic
law.
   Women have been particularly vocal, concerned about losing what
little ground they have gained in recent years. By Islamic law and
tradition, women are subservient to men.
   Ms. Piracha and Sher Afgan, former minister of state for
parliamentary affairs, spoke of several options, mostly designed to
stall the bill in the National Assembly.
   It must be introduced in the assembly within 90 days of Senate
passage. Ms. Bhutto's 19-month-old government is expected to refer
it either to a committee or the Islamic Ideology Council, which her
predecessor, Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, established to debate
theological questions.
   Ms. Bhutto often has agreed to a form of Islamic law on
condition Pakistan's religious leaders reach a consensus, which
many in her party consider unlikely.
   Supporters and critics alike say Ms. Bhutto must take care with
Islamic fundamentalists, whose violent riots in 1977 eventually
brought down her father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
   He was convicted of conspiring to murder a political foe, who
was not killed, and was hanged in 1979. Gen. Zia, who overthrew
him, held power until his death in a plane crash in August 1988.
   ``Politically, they cannot afford to throw'' the bill out,
Khurshed Ahmed said of the governing party. ``They would be
sounding their death knell.''
   Ahmed leads the small but powerful Jamaat-i-Islami, or Party of
God, which is said to have organized the rioting in 1977. He told
The Associated Press history could be repeated if Ms. Bhutto's
government tried to kill the legislation.
   ``We may call for midterm elections,'' Ahmed said, ``or we may
even call for a mass movement against'' the Pakistan People's Party.
   The prime minister, who wears the traditional Islamic head
covering and is seldom seen without a voluminous shawl, has been
criticized by women activists for what they call her attempt to be
``more religious than the mullahs,'' or Islamic clerics.
   Fundamentalist Islamic scholars dismiss Ms. Bhutto's
conservative conduct. Ahmed said she ``represents a secular trend,
whatever Islamic windowdressing she puts on.''
   He said women who opposed Islamic law ``Westernized, alienated''
and had ``no knowledge of Islam.''
   Women wearing billowing shawls that covered them from head to
foot protested two years ago when Zia proposed that Sharia be
adopted in his quest to ``Islamize'' this nation of 110 million. He
died before the legislation could be passed.
   Islamic law would supersede the Pakistan's Moslem Family Law,
which guarantees equal inheritance rights and governs child
custody. Shariah gives the father the right to the children and
inheritance favors sons.
   Under the proposed legislation, commissions would be established
to ``Islamize'' the media, education and finance. Clerics would
have the power to interpret law and pass judgment.
   ``Mullahs are not fanatics,'' Ahmed said. ``They have just as
much right to judge. This is not a test. We are Moslem, but we're
for simple Islam, not for the mullahs' Islam.''

<HEAD>Paying the Dues on ``Die Hard 2''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His previous films included ``Nightmare on Elm
Street IV'' and a political thriller banned in Finland. But the way
Renny Harlin sees it, he was more than ready to direct a Hollywood
blockbuster such as ``Die Hard 2.''
   ``I was one of those annoying kids who was always in charge when
kids get together,'' recalled Harlin, a native of Helsinki.
   ``I would write little plays and tell people what to do. I was
always the one who ended up with the biggest responsibility, like
the prom in high school. There had to be a great program and a show
and a play. Everybody else goes and has fun and there's always
somebody left alone who has to worry about everything.
   ``I was also crazy about films, but the traditional American
storytelling was something that really appealed to me. I have to
confess I loved American movies more than the European movies.''
   Harlin, 31, soon discovered that directing ``Die Hard 2'' was
like running the biggest prom in history, with a lot more to worry
about than finding a good band.
   Weather was the main culprit. A Christmas blizzard had to be
filmed in a Los Angeles studio after unseasonably warm temperatures
and rain ruined location shooting in Denver; Moses Lake, Wash.; and
Alpena, Mich. Bitter winds plagued filming in Mead, Colo., just
outside of Denver.
   Also, officials at the Metropolitan Washington Airports
Authority objected to the movie's story of right-wing former
military officials taking control of a major airport in the
nation's capital. The authority's legal counsel, Edward S. Faggen,
complained the script ``reflects a reckless disregard for the truth
or the reality of the airport and airport operations.''
   So Harlin had plenty of chances for nervous pacing. Give him
credit for a big crowd-pleaser _ having Bruce Willis ejected out of
an airplane like a rock from a slingshot. But how about when the
star makes a call from Washington, D.re running themselves
into the ground just to keep even.
   The stories of ``All Work, No Play,'' have a familiar ring to
them. Most of us know that we work harder nowadays to maintain the
standard of living our parents enjoyed. And it's sad to see people
working so hard for so little.
   ``Technophobia,'' the second segment, is the weakest. Keith
Morrison reports that videocassette recorders are in 68 million
U.S. households, but 80 percent of the people cannot program their
machines to record.
   Morrison says ``Real Life'' asked 125 Americans to record a
one-hour program. Two-thirds of them, he reports, ``either gave up
or screwed up.''
   It's a clever story idea, because Americans hate to read their
owners' manuals and VCR makers don't know how to write them or how
to make a simple time-delay recording system. But that's as far as
it goes.
   But Morrison's narration is cloyingly cute, delivered with the
kind of oily, aw-folks-isn't-this-clever voice-over that will have
you screaming by the time it ends seven minutes, 30 seconds later.
   The segment ``Betty'' uses family photographs, home movies and
old videotape to create a touching portrait of an emotionally
disturbed woman who gave birth to a daughter and ended her life
homeless on the streets of New York City.
   The best segment, however, is ex-``Today'' staffer Boyd
Mattson's droll, coast-to-coast road trip to a variety roadside
attractions available in the typical 4.8-night American vacation.
   He visits Reptiland, Rock City, the Black Madonna Shrine and
Grotto in the Ozarks, the linoleum-floored Meramec Caverns in
Missouri, the Buffalo Ranch, and Mahan's Half Acre in Hulaville,
Calif. It's wonderfully funny.
   NBC News spent serious money on ``Real Life with Jane Pauley,''
and it shows. Executive producer Shelley Lewis and director Kyle
Good, eight producers and dozens of technicians took a nifty
snapshot of our national life.
   Now if Jane would just stop saying ``That's real life!'' after
each segment, that would be REAL television.

   WELL, BLANK MY BLANK! DEPT.: Brace for it, America! For the
fourth or fifth time, ``The Match Game'' returns to television
today on ABC.
   Traditionally, this Mark Goodson-produced game show has been the
home of the greatest double-entemdres on television, as contestants
tried to match fill-in-the-blank statements with a panel of six,
high-spirited celebrity guests, including TV personality Charles
Nelson Reilly, who appeared on the original.
   The original ``Match Game,'' with host Gene Rayburn, aired on
NBC from 1962 to 1969, then on CBS from 1973 to 1979. An evening
version ran in syndication from 1975 to 1982.
   Ross Shafer is host of the new show. Its format has been
expanded to include one-on-one celebrity matches and the
high-scoring Super Match segment, with a $500 audience match and a
$10,000 celebrity-match round.
   ``Jeopardy!'' it's not.

   After countless centuries of lumbering
through fields and chewing cud, bovines have moseyed into the art
world.
   The cow, a pastoral fixture since ancient times and more
recently the model for such kitsch items as T-shirts and salt
shakers, is now the subject of a traveling art exhibit.
   ``The Cow in Photograph and Folktale,'' displaying 39
photographs of cows, bulls and heifers, opened last month at the
New York State Museum in downtown Albany for the purpose of
``exploring the richness of bovine culture.''
   The show features photographs dating from the 19th century to
today illustrating the cow in just about every imaginable
circumstance and then some. There are close-up cows, cows in
fields, cows being milked, cows in thistle, and even a shot of a
giant fiberglass cow.
   ``For centuries, the common image of the cow has inspired and
intrigued artists working in all mediums: in such simple and
elegant views, the beauty of the beast,'' wrote Caralee Aber in the
exhibit's program notes.
   Aber put the show together two years ago while working at the
George Eastman house in Rochester. Aber has since died, but said in
an interview at the time that she became piqued by the aesthetic
potential of the cow when she came across an old black and white
cow portrait from 1908.
   She decided the cow merited an exhibit.
   ``It took very quiet, subtle cajoling to get it going,'' she
said. ``The first response was: `Cows? Why Cows?' People would
giggle.''
   But Aber persisted and gathered the finest photos of cows she
could find with some cow poetry, proverbs, trivia and even a cow
video to produce her own particular ode to bovines.
   ``There's a tremendous culture connected to the cow,'' Aber said.
   That's no understatement. Europe, the birthing ground of Western
culture, is said to be named after the great White Moon-Cow. And to
this day, cows wander impoverished streets of India, protected by
an aura of sacredness.
   The cows' devotional heyday, though, probably came in ancient
times when the animal was often thought to be the Great Creator.
   Ancient Egyptians revered Mother Hathor as the heavenly cow
whose udder produced the Milky Way, whose body was the firmament
and who daily gave birth to the sun, according to Barbara G. Walker
in The Women's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets.
   In old India, a creation myth went that the universe was
literally ``curdled'' into shape from milk of a great lunar cow.
Some ancients in the Near East believed that the human race itself
was curdled from the goddess' milk. To them, we are nothing but
curds.
   ``Thus the cow was honored as a wet nurse of humanity, and her
image is still inadvertently invoked to this day as an expletive
Holy Cow, or a pejorative Sacred Cow,'' concludes Walker.
   Heady stuff. But lately the cow has come down from the altar to
show up in most unlikely places. Such items as packages of premium
ice cream, T-shirts and jewelry all began sporting the stark black
and white bovine image in the 1980s.
   Holy Cow Inc., a mail-order business based in Middlebury, Vt.,
offers the usual cow shirts, mugs and creamers along with more
esoteric cow stuff such as Holstein timepieces, cow golf balls,
4-foot high cow cut outs, and even a T-shirt of Chairman Moo. ``One
billion cows can't be wrong,'' reads the catalog.
   Woody Jackson,founder of Holy Cow, said his cow-culture items,
including his painted cow-landscapes, grossed about $1.5 million
last year.
   ``I think it makes people nostalgic,'' said Jackson trying to
explain cow magnetism. ``It reminds people of a simpler time plus
everyone grows up on milk.''
   The exhibit itself explores the relation between Man and Cow
with both humorous and more serious images. An old print by Lewis
Hines of a farmer and his son milking a cow is complimented by
``Boris and the World's Largest Cow,'' a shot of a dog admiring a
giant fiberglass cow.
   Other pictures, such as ``Rancher With Her Prize Cattle'' by
June Van Cleef, shows just what cows can mean to people.
   Van Cleef said her picture of a Texas woman beaming proudly next
to her animal shows how consummately important cows and cattle are
to a whole segment of our culture.
   ``The cattle are everything to her,'' Van Cleef said.

<HEAD>Yes, There Is a Credit Crunch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The public concession by the Federal Reserve
chairman that a credit crunch might exist confirms what a lot of
small-business people have been saying for months _ without getting
much of a hearing.
   The fact they didn't receive a hearing suggests something might
be wrong with the way regulators, and some important business
institutions, gather and assimilate information.
   Cries of distress from the small-business and beginning-business
sectors were at first dismissed as:
   _Anecdotal. Why, the explanation went, everyone knows of a good
little business that got a raw deal from the bank. But, dramatic as
such stories might sound, it was said, the numbers didn't add up to
a trend.
   _Geographically limited, such as to New England.
   _Limited to industries related to building and real estate,
which already were overextended.
   In response to the clamor from some small businesses that
bankers were denying them credit, the Conference Board's chief
economist, Gail Fosler, observed ``there is no evidence of a credit
crisis, managed or otherwise. ...''
   The National Federation of Independent Business, which regularly
surveys more than 500,000 independent business members, said it
found no evidence of credit tightening nationally.
   All this seemed in contradiction to the cries coming from other
directions.
   The Small Business Association of New England asked 60 business
people at a meeting if a crunch existed. Forty-eight said yes.
   Hardly a day passed in any area of the country larger than a few
square miles that some small-business person didn't complain about
some sort of financial restrictions by local banks.
   The National Association of Home Builders surveyed 1,142 members
and declared that ``builders are being indiscriminately cut off
from the credit markets. Production is dropping. People are losing
their jobs and businesses.''
   The Fed retreated from its earlier position. It surveyed some
members banks and found more than half had tightened lending
standards for small- and medium-size companies.
   Now, six weeks later, Chairman Alan Greenspan says the Fed is
prepared to take modest ``offsetting action'' against a crunch.
   The episode provokes questions: Why did it take so long to
recognize? Why were the small-business complaints so readily
dismissed? What is wrong with the ways business and regulators
determine if a crunch exists?
   Some possibilities:
   _Tight money is measured by what happens to the nation's largest
companies rather than to small companies or beginning companies.
Evidence is statistical. It does not measure banker attitudes.
   In this regard, it is significant that the credit crunch didn't
originate so much with a tight-money policy by the Fed as from
voluntary restraints by bankers, some overreacting to their
previous easy-lending policies.
   In a sense, the money was there, but the banks didn't lend it.
   _Typically, many of the smaller businesses in such groups at the
National Federation of Independent Business rely on internal
financing rather than on credit lines from the bank. Moreover, they
are established businesses.
   _The worst of the credit restraints seem to have affected very
small businesses, entrepreneurial ventures and businesses seeking
to take what bankers might consider imprudent risks.
   More often than some regulators, statisticians, academics and
economists might like to concede, national statistics often
overlook this category. The numbers they gather and analyze usually
are big-business numbers.
   In defense of the tight-money situation, some observers have
commented that it served the purpose of discouraging new and risky
ventures, such as real estate developments in areas already
overbuilt. Can't quibble with that.
   What some small-business people feel angry and disturbed about,
however, is that it is their ideas, their innovations, their
dedication, their risk-taking that creates new enterprises, new
jobs, new competition.
   In short, they say, it is new businesses that seed economic
change and development, and it isn't fair to them or to the country
that good ideas and good small businesses should be financially
starved and then ignored.

<HEAD>Farm Workers Leave Chemicals Behind To Grow, Market Organic
Produce</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY301 of July 10</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guadalupe Lechuga has spent most of his
52 years traveling around the country picking other people's crops
in fields, many tainted with toxic agricultural chemicals.
   This year was different. He didn't board up the doors and
windows of his home in the southern tip of Texas to travel north.
   Tired of the chemicals and of working for ``los patrones'' (the
bosses), Lechuga and a group of 30 migrant farm workers' families
formed a cooperative to grow and market their own organic
vegetables.
   Lechuga, foreman of the new San Juan Farm Workers Cooperative,
said the co-op's small plots of tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, squash
and other vegetables represent the first time he can call a crop
his own.
   ``I think it will be good,'' Lechuga said. ``All my life, I've
had bosses.''
   Like other migrants, his children year after year had to leave
school in April or May to follow the work north. They typically
didn't return until November, and spent their lives barely getting
by.
   Many migrant children never catch up in school, so they drop
out. It's a way of life that keeps the Lower Rio Grande Valley,
with its tens of thousands of farm workers, consistently among the
poorest areas of the United States.
   The co-op's goal is to pull them out of the cycle by setting
them up as independent, small farmers. They're also cashing in on
the growing demand for organically grown produce.
   Co-op members are trained in organic farming under a project
sponsored by the Texas Department of Agriculture, which also
certifies the land is organic. Buyers of organic produce usually
require certification by a third party, such as a state agency, to
ensure it was grown without artificial chemicals.
   With the training, co-op members eventually should be able to
operate from their own plots of two to five acres, said Neal
Warnes, the project manager, who has helped develop other organic
farms.
   ``We're trying to get people into a line they can try to make
some money at,'' Warnes said.
   U.S. retail sales of organic foods reached an all-time high of
$572 million in 1989, government figures show. The Texas Department
of Agriculture reported $11 million in retail organic food sales in
the state last year, and estimated it could increase as much as
tenfold this year.
   Organic produce supplies tend to fall short of demand at the
wholesale level in Texas, said Arthur Beaudet, produce buyer for
Texas Health Distributors, a subsidiary of Austin-based Whole Foods
Inc., one of the largest organic-produce retailers in the United
States. California organics producers are the most advanced, he
said.
   Health-food restaurants and grocery co-ops in the Austin area
have bought the bulk of the San Juan co-op's early crops, Warnes
said.
   The farm workers were stunned when a buyer paid them $1 a pound
for organic tomatoes recently, more than twice the going local
price, Warnes said.
   ``There's a health food store that would take a thousand pounds
a week if we had them,'' he said.
   The co-op plans to produce 28 crops in a year-round rotation;
plans also include more families joining and establishing their own
farms.
   While they probably won't get rich, Warnes reckoned some could
make up to $30,000 a year, more than double what many farm workers
earn.
   Some of the 30 families in the co-op had to go out of state
again this summer to find work because the operation remains small,
on seven acres owned by the United Farm Workers Union in San Juan.
The co-op has access to more land when it is ready to expand,
Warnes said.
   Maria Gomez, 42, said she stayed behind this summer to help the
co-op get started, ``to see if we can become independent, to see if
we can have our own crops.''
   Ms. Gomez said she has seen many farm workers fall ill from
working among pesticides and chemical fertilizers, or from handling
treated crops. She remembers one man whose skin on the hands and
feet peeled off ``like leather. And that's on the outside. Who
knows what's happening on the inside?''
   Instead of chemical pesticides, the co-op uses natural
substances such as rotenone, an odorless crystalline derivative of
some kinds of plant roots. The co-op's natural fertilizers include
seaweed and fish emulsion.
   Thick walls of sunflowers surround the co-op's vegetable plots,
serving as buffer zones to filter out airborne chemicals from
non-organic operations in the heavily farmed valley.
   The co-op's small ``family farm'' tracts and organic methods are
the type promoted by environmentalists. Agribusiness proponents,
however, have written off such operations as outdated and
inefficient, compared to farms with hundreds or thousands of acres.
   Nonetheless, the prospect of sustaining themselves with their
own crops means much to people like Ms. Gomez, who is enthusiastic
about ``everybody working together for a better way of living.''
   ``They're going to have their own land and they're going to be
able to sell their own tomatoes, cucumbers and other crops,''
Lechuga said.
   And, he said, children will be able to finish an entire year of
school.

   Wall Street will try to break a jinx of sorts as
hundreds of corporations issue midyear earnings reports over the
next couple of weeks.
   In each of the past three quarterly peak reporting periods _ in
April, January and last October _ the stock market has suffered a
setback as profits fell short of expectations.
   On the basis of the early evidence, a good many earnings
disappointments are in store again for the second quarter, which
ended June 30. But hopes have built up that the market can ride out
the storm this time, given its steady rise of late to new highs.
   The situation spotlights a dichotomy that has been confronting
market participants for almost a year now.
   Overall statistics on the economy have been painting a picture
of an ``ideal combination of modest and non-inflationary growth,''
in the words of Edward Kerschner, analyst at PaineWebber Inc. But
corporate earnings figures project the contrasting image of a
``profit recession.''
   As a result, Kerschner says, ``the market has been dancing a new
three-step _ steady to up in the two months when the macroeconomic
data are encouraging, then falling in the month when earnings are
reported.
   ``Only at the end of the quarter, when profit reports are
disappointing, does the stock market come under pressure.''
   This behavior spotlights a question as old as the market itself:
What precisely is the relationship between business earnings and
stock prices?
   Nobody disputes that profits are a basic building block in the
structure of stock values, since they represent the flow of money
available for dividend payments to shareholders and for
reinvestment in future growth.
   But the correlation between the two can sometimes seem very
tenuous. This year, when stocks have jumped ahead while earnings
slumped, has been one of those times.
   ``Investors have always believed that corporate earnings are a
principal, if not the key, ingredient in determining the direction
of stock prices,'' says the investment management firm J.W.
Seligman &amp; Co. in a recent report on the subject.
   ``As profits increase, stock prices reflect this improvement.
When they contract, prices are expected to fall. While this truism
appears quite obvious in theory, unfortunately it is not clear in
actual practice.''
   A check of market history over the last four decades provides a
good illustration of this inconsistent relationship, Seligman
analysts say.
   ``There is a clear correlation between long-term earnings growth
and stock appreciation. Thus, the basic premise is valid over long
time frames,'' they observe.
   But deviations from the norm can test the faith of even the most
patient investor.
   In the 1970s, for example, profits of the companies in Standard
&amp; Poor's industrial stock index increased 170 percent by one
measure. But the index itself gained just 56 percent over the
decade, in a market buffeted by worries about such matters as
accelerating inflation and the ``energy crisis.''
   In a given year, the divergence can be even greater.
   Analysts say investors must bear in mind that stock prices
reflect expectations about future earnings more than any response
to past results. Thus, the current strength in the stock market,
despite earnings weakness over the last several quarters, can be
interpreted as a forecast of improved profits in the
not-too-distant future.
   Seligman concludes: ``If business continues to weaken and
profits slide further, it seems likely that the current rally will
prove to have been a false one.
   ``We believe, however, that probabilities favor market price
action being an accurate forecasting mechanism as it has been so
often in the past. Profits should improve as year-to-year
comparisons become more favorable in the third and fourth
quarters.''

   Kartar Singh has a recurring nightmare.
   He's driving home from his machine tool factory. Sikh militants
in turbans of iridescent orange surround his car and police are too
frightened to help.
   ``I see the nozzles of the guns and they fire and everything
goes red,'' he said.
   These days in Punjab, Singh's nightmare is often a reality, and
being a Sikh does not exempt him from the terror.
   Sikh militants have killed about 1,400 people so far this year
in their fight for a separate nation called Khalistan, or Land of
the Pure. Security forces have killed nearly 250 of the extremists
and some innocent bystanders.
   Government officials fear 1990 will be the deadliest year since
the separatist violence began nine years ago.
   A seemingly endless spiral of harsh police crackdowns, rising
crime, unemployment and the introduction of advanced weapons by the
militants has thrown this rich agricultural state into chaos.
   The increasing violence threatens the position of Prime Minister
V.P. Singh, who has partially staked his prestige on being able to
solve the problem.
   Punjab's geography adds complications. It adjoins both Pakistan,
India's long-time antagonist, and Jammu-Kashmir state, where a
movement within the state's Moslem majority seeks independence from
India.
   Sikh militants in Punjab are believed to be one source of
weapons for Kashmir's separatists, and India has accused Pakistan
of providing arms and training to rebels in both states. Pakistan
denies it.
   ``We are facing a war,'' said Narinderpal Singh, police chief of
Punjab's Tarn Taran district. ``It seems like it will go on
forever.''
   Singh, which means lion, is part of every Sikh name, but also
has become a common surname for Hindus. Prime Minister Singh is a
Hindu.
   The fields of Punjab are green and lined with trees. The
northwestern state is India's breadbasket, producing 60 percent of
the country's rice and wheat.
   Terror dominates the lush countryside. Hindus, once the main
target of Sikh militants, have abandoned dozens of villages around
the Sikh holy city of Amritsar, an agricultural center 250 miles
northwest of New Delhi.
   Fellow Sikhs like Kartar Singh now bear the brunt of the
separatists' wrath.
   ``They either say we're police informants or we don't love
Khalistan enough,'' he said.
   In Tarn Taran, 121 of the 137 civilians killed so far this year
were Sikhs.
   ``Even a barking dog makes me afraid now,'' said Gurmit Kaur, a
20-year-old Sikh woman in Harike village, 30 miles south of
Amritsar. ``Everything sounds like gunshots.''
   Last April, Ms. Kaur watched as militants dragged her father
from their farmhouse and killed him under an oak tree. They accused
him of being a police informer.
   No one turns to the government for help.
   Police and other security forces have been blamed for hundreds
of deaths. Officials acknowledge security forces have tortured Sikh
prisoners and killed suspected militants in ``fake encounters.''
   ``We are stopping that now,'' Virendra Verma, governor of
Punjab, said in an interview. ``We are trying to win back the
hearts of the people.''
   Verma recently announced creation of 10,000 police and
paramilitary jobs for unemployed Sikhs. Critics say the program
will help the militants by giving thousands of Sikhs access to
weapons.
   Many Punjabis say police brutality continues.
   In Rajchauck village, half a mile from Pakistan, residents say
police beat 20-year-old Baljit Singh to death in early June. After
Singh was arrested, villagers went to the police station to plead
for his release, saying he was not a militant. The police said he
had committed suicide.
   Federal authorities recently sent the National Security Guard,
an anti-terrorist force known as the ``Black Cats,'' back into
Punjab. The action appears destined to stir up more enmity, even
among law enforcement officers.
   The Black Cats, predominantly Hindu, generally have been used
only in extreme situations, such as sieges to dislodge militants
from the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the holiest shrine of Sikhism.
   ``Last year they came to our village and killed a bootlegger and
two laborers, none of them ... militants,'' said Jagdeep Singh, a
Sikh police chief in Harike village. ``This year, they'll do
worse.''
   His comment highlights a growing gulf between Hindus and Sikhs
in the state.
   A decade ago, the two communities frequently intermarried and
Hindu families adopted a tradition of raising one son as a Sikh.
That tradition died as the ethnic conflict grew.
   Sikhism began in the 15th century as an alternative to the rival
Hindu and Moslem faiths, combining Hindu rituals with Islam's
belief in one god.
   It became a warrior faith after Moslem Moguls beheaded a Sikh
prophet in the late 17th century. His son ordered all Sikh men to
become soldiers of the faith and take the name Singh.
   Sikh religious law requires men to wear a knife and prohibits
them from cutting their hair or beards, which are considered signs
of virility.
   In 1981, Sikh radicals began the campaign for Khalistan to save
what they described as their dying culture.
   Militants attacked Hindus in Punjab, where about 60 percent of
the people are Sikhs. In India as a whole, Sikhs make up only 2
percent of the 880 million people and Hindus are 82 percent.
   Separatists stored weapons in the Golden Temple. On June 3,
1984, the army attacked the temple in ``Operation Bluestar,'' which
Sikhs say defiled the shrine. More than 1,200 people were killed,
most of them Sikhs.
   Six months later, two Sikh bodyguards assassinated Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi. Hindu mobs rampaged in northern India,
killing more than 3,000 Sikhs.
   In 1988, the government again besieged the Golden Temple,
killing 46 people. Plainclothes security agents now patrol the
grounds and armed guards search visitors.
   Sikh militants fled to the Mand, a snake-infested mixture of
badlands and swamp at the confluence of the Satlug and Beas rivers,
which run through the heart of Punjab.
   Authorities say the area is impossible to patrol. ``The only way
to really beat the terrorists is to release lions into that
swamp,'' said Ashok Kumar, who commands a company of the Border
Security Force responsible for the Mand.
   He said the Sikhs are the best-armed militants in India, with
night vision devices, plastic explosives, automatic rifles,
rocket-propelled grenades and shoulder-launched rockets.
   Police said the separatists had stolen about $1 million from
Punjab banks in the past three months. They have kidnapped hundreds
of people for ransoms totaling another $1 million.
   ``India must accept Khalistan or there will be total anarchy,''
said Rajinder Singh Mehta, head of the Sikh Students Federation,
one of about 10 Sikh militant groups.
   Even farming, Punjab's lifeline, has come under attack.
   Militants have killed 24 members of the Rice Millers Association
this year, including 10 Sikhs, and held 100 for ransom, said Ashok
Sachdeva, a Hindu who heads the association and seldom leaves his
home in Amritsar.
   ``What is life if there is no freedom?'' he asked. ``All of us
in Punjab are like caged birds.''

   Ten Sikh militants burst into
Shingra Singh's house and kidnapped the successful merchant, who
has sold household appliances for a decade in this village
surrounded by rice paddies and cornfields.
   The abduction and payment of $12,000 ransom were arranged by his
son Mekla, 17.
   ``I've spent my life bargaining,'' said Singh, a 37-year-old
Sikh, sitting in the shade near his shop. ``But who would have
thought that I'd bargain for my life, and do it with my son.''
   The separatist battle for an independent Sikh homeland pits
father against son and brother against brother.
   Mekla Singh, on the bench beside his father, said he was ordered
to arrange the kidnapping.
   ``I believe in Khalistan,'' he said. ``If I am ordered by my
leaders, I will obey.''
   Singh did not press charges against his son, who he said
arranged ``very tasty food'' during the 10 days of captivity.
   He is sending Mekla to work at the family hotel near New Delhi,
and the boy is happy to go.
   ``There is no future in Punjab,'' Mekla said. ``We all want
Khalistan, but we know we won't get it. There are only guns and
death here.''
   Singh said he would stay in Punjab to look after the business,
``but after that experience, all I want to do is die. My family is
everything to me, and this trouble has hurt my family.''

<HEAD>Australia Faces Growing Drug Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL ALEXANDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rolls-Royce and Jaguar showrooms on
William Street will open in a couple of hours. Before they do, a
city worker sweeps up the used syringes and condoms from a night's
business of another kind.
   Welcome to the edge of King's Cross, a stretch of nightclubs,
restaurants and strip joints where virtually anything is for sale.
   ``This is the sex and drug center for the whole country,'' said
Dr. Sigrid van Beek, director of the Kirketon Road Center, which
offers help and medical care. ``From midnight to 6 a.m., if you're
looking for prostitution or drugs, it's easy to score around here.''
   Prostitution is either legal or largely tolerated in Australia,
depending on the state, so Sydney police concentrate on controlling
the abuse of drugs and alcohol.
   The narcotics problem is growing, but is far short of the
magnitude in the United States. Crack cocaine and ``ice,'' for
instance, have yet to arrive in significant quantities.
   Seizures of cocaine at ports and airports rose from 42 pounds in
the 1988-89 fiscal year to nearly 155 pounds in 1989-90, officials
said.
   Marijuana comes from Southeast Asia and other prime growing
areas, and from domestic farming operations that sometimes include
huge, irrigated tracts with security systems.
   Heroin is smuggled from abroad in increasing quantities. The raw
materials for amphetamines are smuggled in, but the drugs are made
here.
   Customs and the Australian Federal Police said in a joint
statement that most amphetamines ``are produced through backyard
manufacture in clandestine laboratories.''
   A survey in 1988, which provides the latest figures available,
indicated there were 30,000 to 50,000 drug addicts and 60,000
occasional users among the 12 million Australians aged 14 and
older. It said 1.2 million to 1.4 million acknowledged using
marijuana in the previous year and 240,000 said they had used
amphetamines.
   Police suspect that in an attempt to get around strict
inspection of people and goods arriving from known drug areas,
dealers are using other South Pacific countries as way stations.
   In February, U.S. officials seized a 6,600-pound shipment of
marijuana from Thailand that had been shipped first to New Zealand,
where it was concealed in a shipping container of carpets and
woolens.
   Tasmania, an island state off the south coast, is one of the few
places in the world where opium poppies are grown legally. From the
poppy resin, pharmaceutical companies produce morphine and codeine
phosphate for export.
   Security at the 17,000 acres of poppy fields was tightened
recently after 500 grams of resin was found in Victoria state and
traced to Tasmania.
   Sedatives like Rohypnol and Serepax are popular with young
people and pharmacists have been accused of selling the drugs at
reduced prices to attract customers. Mixing them with heroin has
become a deadly practice.
   ``Of the 54 heroin deaths examined by the institute in the past
year, 32 tested positive for benzos (sedatives like Rohypnol),''
said Stephen Cordner of the Victoria state Institute of Forensic
Pathology.
   The combination recently killed four teen-age girls in a group
of seven who grew up in Redfern, an Aboriginal neighborhood in
Sydney, and were confined together in the Reiby Detention Center
for juveniles.
   A fifth, 18-year-old Stephanie Jones, was hospitalized with
broken legs and a broken arm after jumping from a police station
window. Another was under guard at Reiby, classified as ``out of
control,'' and her sister, the seventh in the group, was to be
released into a drug-rehabilitation program.
   ``The deaths have made me heaps scared, but I want to get off
drugs,'' Stephanie said from her hospital bed. ``I don't want to
die like that.''
   Stephanie said she used heroin because she felt ``left out.''
   Some officials have begun to talk of keeping the drug problem
under control rather than eliminating it.
   Australian Democrats, a small political party, has recommended a
government-run distribution service to take drugs away from
organized crime.
   Mike Elliott, a party representative in South Australia state,
said in June that tough laws had not halted the drug trade and
experience showed it would continue growing. He said drug use
should be treated as a public health problem, not a crime.
   Elliot said a distribution service with tight controls would not
lead to commercialization of drugs.
   Dr. van Beek's Kirketon Road Center was established three years
ago to fight the spread of AIDS among intravenous drug users, and
gives out 15,000 needles a month. Needle-sharing by drug users is
one of the main ways the deadly disease is spread.
   ``Luckily, we were very fast in setting up the needle-exchange
program,'' Dr. van Beek told an interviewer.
   ``It's too late in the United States, where 80 percent'' of
intravenous drug users are infected with the AIDS virus, she said,
but ``it's only 3 to 5 percent here.''
   Asked about concern that distributing needles might encourage
drug use, she said: ``Thank God we haven't run into that attitude
here. No study in the world shows that you encourage drug use by
providing clean needles. Would you use ... drugs just because a
needle was available?''

   Jean Lennane sees the results of drugs
every day and says the biggest threat is alcohol, particularly to
the young.
   Drinking is almost a way of life in Australia, where the pub is
a favorite meeting place.
   ``It dates back to the foundation of the colony here 200 years
ago when the currency for a while was rum,'' said Ms. Lennane,
director of drug and alcohol services at Sydney's Rozelle Hospital
since 1980.
   ``There was a temperance movement for a while, but since World
War II, the amount of alcohol consumed in Australia has shot up,''
she said.
   ``It's much worse than in the United States. People are just
killing themselves with it.''
   Health officials estimate 10 percent of Australians drink the
equivalent of about 1.4 ounces of pure alcohol a day, enough to
lead eventually to brain damage, heart problems, cirrhosis of the
liver or other diseases.
   The Australian Medical Association recommended this month that
taxes on alcohol be raised 40 percent, which it estimated would
reduce consumption by 20 percent.
   ``Of people going into the hospital for treatment of some
ailment, statistics show about one in five is alcohol-related,''
Ms. Lennane said. ``It's about two in five for psychiatric
hospitals.''
   In a campaign against drunk driving, nearly all Australian
states have lowered the blood-alcohol level at which people are
considered intoxicated to 0.05 percent. That is half the 0.10
percent used by New York state.
   Alcohol-related deaths involving only vehicles have decreased,
but the number of pedestrians killed has risen. Dr. David Hill,
director of the trauma unit at St. Vincent's Hospital in Sydney,
said 80 percent to 90 percent of injured pedestrians treated there
were intoxicated.
   More than 4,000 pedestrians were killed or injured last year in
New South Wales state, of which Sydney is the capital.
   Ms. Lennane is primarily concerned with two kinds of brain
damage to which long-term drinking contributes.
   One is caused by a combination of heavy drinking and poor diet
that results in thiamin depletion and loss of short-term memory,
among other problems.
   ``We have far more of this than any other country,'' she said.
``The difficulty with the Australian diet, as compared with that in
the United States and the United Kingdom, is that we don't add
thiamin to our bread. ... If that happens, I believe we will have
less of this problem.''
   The other problem is frontal-lobe damage, which affects the
abilities to plan, organize, form concepts, structure information
and learn from mistakes. This can result from heavy, regular
drinking even with a good diet.
   Rozelle Hospital has a 55-bed ward for patients with
alcohol-related brain damage that treats about 250 people a year.
Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney has a neuropsychology ward
that treats 400 people a year for brain damage resulting from
alcohol.
   ``Some of it gets better if they stay sober, especially if
they're young, but if you have people who've been drunk during most
of their adolescence and haven't done any maturing, then they can
have a lot of emotional and social problems,'' Ms. Lennane said.
``We haven't had much luck in rehabilitating them.
   ``One of the things that alarms me is the way the average age of
our patients has started to decline since I started here in 1980.
The youngest person being treated then was 38, and that was quite
exceptional. Now we get people in their early 30s, even in their
20s.''

   The precision-cropped hair is mostly gray, but
those famous blue eyes remain clear, his skin unlined and his body
trim.
   At 64, Academy Award-winning actor Paul Newman races on,
juggling success in three high pressure, demanding professions:
acting, the food business and auto racing. And his passions run
high in all.
   When he's not directing, acting or promoting his line of
``Newman's Own'' food products, he takes to the track. With his
latest movie, ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge,'' ready for release this fall,
Newman's ready to race.
   This season, he's driving a limited schedule on the SCCA's
Trans-Am circuit as the teammate of 22-year-old Scott Sharp, the
son of Bob Sharp, co-owner of Newman-Sharp Racing. Newman has
watched the younger driver improve almost daily and laments one
small part of aging.
   ``A young driver like Scott, who's got a great gift, just keeps
going faster and faster,'' Newman said during an interview before
finishing 16th in a recent Trans-Am race in Cleveland.
   ``Young kids like Scott think about winning. I think about
whether I'm going to have a pulse,'' he joked.
   ``When you get older and older, you start slowing down.
Everything is off one-50th of 1 percent. Your eyes are a little
off, your reflexes, touch _ everything. You multiply that by just a
factor of 1 percent, that's two or three seconds a lap.''
   But Newman, whose interest in auto racing was generated on the
set of ``Winning'' in 1968, doesn't regret his late start in the
sport he now loves.
   ``I started at the right time. I had the right kind of
equipment,'' he said. ``I don't regret anything. It came at the
right time. I was getting bored acting.''
   Asked if racing revived his interest in other things, he joked
that his wife, actress Joanne Woodward, says it saved their
marriage. Woodward co-stars in ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge,'' a chronicle
of a middle-class American family.
   Turning serious again, Newman said: ``You become passionate
about one thing, it leads back into something else. If you can gain
a sense of passion and commitment in your life in one arena, it's
bound to bleed back into other arenas.''
   Newman, who has earned four national amateur driving titles and
two Trans-Am victories since beginning his racing career in 1972,
says he never gave driving a race car much thought until he played
an Indy-car driver in ``Winning.''
   What was it that attracted him to the sport?
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``It was just out there, like
anything else, to be learned. I started off very slowly, very
cautious, as I start off everything.''
   Since he has been successful at so much, people tend to believe
things come easily to Newman. He insists the opposite is true.
   ``The light that you think you emanate is not necessarily the
light that other people see,'' he said. ``You think of yourself as
a shy, retiring whatever it is, and some other people will see you
in an entirely different way.
   ``I had always seen (tennis star Ivan) Lendl as a guy with such
a gift. The gift came before the work, but not according to Lendl.
He says if he lays off for three weeks, he's garbage.
   ``You have to constantly learn. Obviously, you have to start
with some kind of gift, but people don't understand that. ... I
don't have a gift for anything. I've only had a gift of pursuit.
   ``That's certainly true in acting. I can't look at the work I
did 20 years ago. I can't even watch it.
   ``In all the things I started to attack _ football, tennis _ I
had no gift for it at all. I had no gift for racing, either. It's
just something that I really wanted to do.''
   Scott Sharp, sitting nearby, said, ``Aw, Paul, you look good at
everything you do.''
   ``Come watch my tennis game sometime,'' Newman said, laughing.
``I really did want to play tennis really badly. I was awful.
   ``I quit playing tennis, then I went back to it in about a year.
I served the ball and the (other) guy hit it back to me. I jiggled
my feet and it sounded like a typewriter; all these feet running
around looking for a position of assurance. There were two feet
down there and it sounded like a stampede or like I was tap
dancing. It was uncertainty. You don't understand that until you
see yourself doing it.
   ``I'm not a natural at things. For instance, I'm a terrible
dancer. I have no gift for dancing. I like to dance with Joanne,
but she's the only one that will tolerate me.''
   His schedule is jet-set, but more because of the multiple
careers he is juggling than any need for glamour or celebrity.
   ``I was never able to delegate responsibility and I do have a
full plate,'' Newman said. ``The thing you don't realize is
somebody sends you a script, as a friend, and all of a sudden
you're devoting five days and taking 20 pages of notes. There goes
the whole damn week.
   ``I've got a script now that the chances of my doing are
probably one in 20. But you spend the time.''
   Will Newman, who remains in shape by running and working out on
a stationary bike, stay around racing for a while?
   ``I have never made a plan about anything in my life and I don't
see it starting to happen now,'' he said. ``I still enjoy (racing).
I don't enjoy going as slow as I'm going, but I still enjoy the
competition.''
   Among the people that Newman has introduced to his adopted sport
is Tom Cruise, his co-star in the 1987 film ``The Color of Money.''
Cruise became so enamored of auto racing he initiated and starred
in ``Days of Thunder,'' a movie about stock car racing.
   Newman politely refused to critique the movie, but he did say,
``I think it will be very good for racing.''
   Asked if he thinks a great movie has yet been made about auto
racing, Newman replied, ``I'm not one to honk my own horn, but
`Winning,' it seems to me, may have been the best movie about
racing.
   ``Not because the racing footage was the best or anything, but
because the people integrated into the racing. And, usually you
find that people are inserted, or transplanted on top of, or glued
to the story.
   ``Great movies ultimately have to be about people.''

   July 19, 1989, 30 minutes before crash, radio call from Sioux

   Capt. Alfred C. Haynes, his doomed jetliner wallowing all over
the Iowa sky, responded to an air traffic controller in the
time-honored jargon of his aviation fraternity. There were 296
``souls on board,'' including his own.
   At 3:59 CDT on a sweltering Wednesday afternoon last July 19,
they all rode a 168-ton flying brick down into a cornfield at 200
miles an hour. In the flame and dust unleashed when the DC-10
cartwheeled out of control, 112 of the souls on board United
Airlines Flight 232 were lost.
   But 184 survived. And as they prepare to return to Sioux City
for a memorial service Thursday, they struggle with unanswerable
questions about life and death, guilt, nightmares, physical
injuries that may never heal, strained relationships with people
they love, and memories that deny them a single good night's sleep.
   They shake at some of life's simplest events, afraid that a
highway bridge might fall on them, frightened by the sound and
smoky smell of a child's cap gun, convinced that a washing machine
has an electrical short that will cause a fire.
   Mary Kahl couldn't feel comfortable at work for six months. Paul
Olivier, like many other survivors, won't fly on a DC-10. William
Robertson drew up a list of accomplishments and things he wants to
do in life. Jerry Schemmel quit his job _ too many reminders. Rod
Vetter fears driving into downtown Chicago. What if a car jumps a
guardrail into his lane?
   ``My life is never going to be the same,'' says Upton Rehnberg,
53.
   They question why they lived, when so many others died. They
meet in groups to grieve, they call each other at 3 a.m. to sob,

of sunsets. Their very survival is a shared miracle.
   ``On the plane as we were going down it didn't matter how rich
or how poor you were, what color you were or what your religion
was, where you came from or where you were going,'' says Garry
Priest, 24, of Denver. ``We all drew strength from each other, we
were all in it together. ... As the plane crashed, everybody was
special.''
   The DC-10 was headed to Chicago from Denver when it attempted an
emergency landing at the Sioux Gateway Airport. The jet flipped
once and burst into flames. Forty-five minutes before impact, the
crew had lost all steering control when the tail engine shattered,
spewing out titanium fan blades and chunks of metal that severed
hydraulic lines.
   Many victims were trapped in the charred fuselage. Some, dazed
and burned, walked or crawled to safety. Others were found in
4-foot-high corn, still buckled in seat belts.
   Dozens of survivors will gather Thursday to pay tribute to
Haynes' crew and to the rescuers and townsfolk who opened their
hearts and their homes to them.
   Though each has a unique memory of that terrible day that bonded
them for life, they're all amazed they are alive, and wonder why.

   Rod Vetter, a 40-year-old former Navy flyer who logged more than
300,000 miles with United before the crash, now hesitates before
commiting to a business trip. Even everyday trips downtown can be a
strain.
   ``I have a fear of things falling and things happening that are
out of my control,'' he says.
   ``I never had the fear driving on the interstate of a bridge
collapsing when I was driving underneath it. I have a fear driving
into downtown Chicago ... (wondering) what if a car jumps the
guardrail and goes into my lane? Just weird things like that.''
   Vetter still thinks of that day frequently.
   ``There's a lot of things that key in the thought of the crash,
whether it's black smoke, loud noise, screeching brakes, the smell
of burning plastic,'' says Vetter, who owns an import-export
electronics company in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights.
   ``Some people are saying they are not letting it out of their
minds. Maybe one year's time is not enough time .... Maybe it will
take 10 years to get back to a rational view of life. It's not
going to heal in a year.''

   Kate Wolfe Bressieux hired a handyman to fix her front steps,
inspect her washing machine and dryer for electrical shorts, and
repair anything else around her house he thought might be a safety
problem. By her own description she ``freaked out'' after a fire in
her basement last Christmas.
   A 36-year-old organizational development consultant, Ms. Wolfe
Bressieux is unemployed and recently separated from her husband.
   Days before any trip, she has nightmares that her car will turn
over and burst in flames.
   ``My life has been in total disarray since the crash. I'm having
real difficulty in putting things back together. I'm a very
extroverted person so I'm amazed I've become so isolated and
withdrawn.
   ``When you are sitting next to someone and five minutes later
they are dead and you aren't, you wonder why you aren't. Having
come that close to my own vulnerability, I don't want to be that
vulnerable again.''

   Paul Olivier has flown more than 100,000 miles since October,
when his broken collarbone, broken right foot, broken right knee,
broken ribs, crushed vertebrae and numerous burns had healed enough
to allow him to resume running his Palmer Lake, Colo.,
television-studio design business.
   Olivier won't fly on a DC-10, but he has flown to Hong Kong 10
times since November. On the last trip as the plane prepared to
land, ``I did everything I could to grab a gulp of air but I just
couldn't breathe. That's the worst it has been. I have to force
myself to get on a plane.''
   Olivier was thrown out of Flight 232 on impact, and though he
remembers almost nothing between then and the hospital, the moments
before the crash remain hauntingly vivid.
   ``The girl next to me and I talked about how everything was
going to be OK. We planned how we would exit. I told her if the
plane filled up with smoke she should grab onto my belt. ...''

She, too, has had trouble discussing it.
   ``It's hard to go back and think about what happened to all
those people. We are the lucky ones. We don't have the physical
scars to deal with. There are a lot of people out there with a lot
more pain than what we're suffering.''
   ``Every time I hear about a plane crashing or a plane in trouble
landing, even trains bother me ... it just seems like a feeling of
terror that comes over you,'' she says.

   Ronald Rohde says every day since last July 19 is a gift.
   ``By all rights, I should have been dead almost a year ago,''
says the 40-year-old veterinarian from Marysville, Ohio. ``It's
easier to find the silver lining in the clouds now. Life's
irritations are a little easier to shrug off. What's there to get
worked up about when you could be upside down in a burning airplane?
   ``Every time the sun comes up, I think how lucky I am to be able
to see it,'' says Rohde.
   Now, when he flies, ``I look at the stewardesses and I look at
the pilots and I wonder if it came crunch time if they would
perform as well as the captain and flight crew on Flight 232.''
   His two children worry, saying: ``You're not flying on a DC-10?
Your plane better not crash.' I say, `They usually don't.' ''

   ``There are people who think all of the risks should be covered.

caught Schemmel's ear as he fled.
   ``I was tested a little bit, so that has made me feel better. If

of control your life is ... how rapidly things can change. You
think you're creating your own destiny in your life and you're
not,'' the mother of three says.
   Major disasters rehash all the hurt, she says. And even normal
child's play can cause problems.
   ``The oddest things come out,'' she says. A child brought over a
cap gun once and her son, Andrew, ``got really upset. He didn't
want him to use it. It smelled like a burning airplane.''
   And 23-month-old Sabrina?
   ``She's learned to talk ... and started walking. She has been
running ever since.''

   Despite a modest rebound in business last month, analysts say
retailers felt squeezed because consumers have been losing
confidence in their financial well-being and have grown more
cautious about spending.
   Several of the nation's largest retailers on Thursday reported
better June sales than May's disappointing tallies. Price markdowns
boosted buying at some stores but sluggish economic conditions
continued to restrain overall retail sales growth.
   ``People no longer whip out their plastic cards for anything
that catches their fancy,'' said Kurt Barnard, a consultant and
publisher of a retail industry newsletter.
   Jeffrey Edelman of the investment house Barclays deZoete Wedd
agreed, saying, ``I think we are witnessing a gradual slowing in
the consumer sector.''
   Weakness in employment and income growth, combined with heavy
debt loads, have made shoppers reluctant to spend freely,
especially when considering purchases of expensive, long-lasting
merchandise.
   In an indication that the Federal Reserve Board is worried about
the economy's prospects, Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested Thursday
the central bank might nudge interest rates lower.
   Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee that slow money
supply growth and increasing commercial interest rates indicate
that credit conditions may be tightening independent of central
bank action.
   ``If that is in fact the case, it could have undesirable effects
on the economy that the Federal Reserve would have to consider
offsetting using monetary policy,'' he said.
   An index compiled by Barclays deZoete Wedd measuring sales at
stores open at least a year owned by 22 nationwide retailers rose
7.5 percent in June, up from 5 percent in May.
   But Edelman explained that the percentage change overstated the
actual improvement.
   A pickup in sales at Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's
biggest retailer, heavily influenced the index, which is weighted.
After a barely perceptible 0.9 percent increase in same-store sales
in May, Sears posted a June gain of 3.5 percent. The June figure
was still unimpressive, however.
   Same-store gains, comparing only sales at stores open a year or
longer, give a more accurate reading of a retailer's performance.
New stores typically attract extra shoppers who don't return month
after month.
   Retailers who slashed prices to unload slow-moving summer
clothes also lifted the industry average.
   The promotional activity and markdowns, which reduce the amount
of money retailers receive for goods, are expected to impair the
industry's profitability.
   ``Second quarter profits are going to be under pressure,'' said
Edelman. ``We're not looking at disaster but we're looking at some
deterioration.''
   Most retailers haven't had to slash prices drastically or resort
to unplanned across-the-board clearances because they were carrying
fairly lean inventories of summer goods. But markdowns have been
more prevalent than the industry anticipated when the season began,
analysts said.
   Several discounters did much better than the industry average.
   ``To some degree, lower price discount operators, such as
Target, Wal-Mart and K mart, are doing better than the general
industry, indicative of an extremely cost-conscious consumer,''
said Jeffrey Feiner of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., a Bentonville, Ark.-based nationwide chain
that is the country's third-largest retailer, said its June sales
soared 28 percent. Sales at Wal-Marts open a year or longer grew 14
percent.
   Target, the discount store division of Minneapolis-based
retailer Dayton Hudson Corp., posted a 14 percent gain in total
sales and an 8 percent gain in its same-store sales.
   In a comparision that illustrates the uneven performance among
retailers, Dayton Hudson's department stores had a same-store sales
increase of only 1 percent.
   Among the big general merchandisers reporting Thursday:
   _Sears said its sales in the five weeks ended July 7 rose 3.7
percent. Sales at Chicago-based Sears stores open at least a year
edged up 3.5 percent.
   _K mart Corp., the second largest retailer with headquarters in
Troy, Mich., said its sales in the five weeks ended July 4 rose
13.7 percent while its same-store sales grew 4.3 percent.
   Among big department store operators:
   _J.C. Penney Co., based in Dallas, said its June sales rose 5.3
percent. On a comparable store basis, sales were up 4.1 percent.
   _May Department Stores Co., based in St. Louis, reported a total
June sales gain of 8 percent while comparable store sales rose 3.2
percent gain.
   Among nationwide apparel chains:
   _The Limited Inc., based in Columbus, Ohio, posted a 15 percent
increase in total June sales. Same-store sales rose 5 percent.
   _The Gap Inc., based in San Francisco, said its total June sales
surged 31 percent while its same-store sales increased 24 percent.

<HEAD>Brady Offers Olive Branch in SEC-CFTC Battle; Chicago Cool</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady says he will
oppose further reductions of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission's powers if Congress passes legislation stripping the
agency's authority over stock-index futures.
   Brady offered the olive branch at a Senate committee hearing
Thursday on the Bush administration's plan to transfer control over
stock-index futures to the rival Securities and Exchange Commission.
   One futures industry official said he saw Brady's remarks as an
indication that the secretary thinks ``he's losing'' in the race to
win Senate approval.
   ``I will oppose more sweeping changes to the CFTC authority if
the administration's bill passes in its present form,'' Brady told
the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.
   But outside the hearing, when asked what he would do if Congress
doesn't pass the bill, Brady said: ``I think it will pass.''
   A spokesman for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Andrew Yemma,
declined comment but noted that in the past the Merc has favored
merging the SEC and CFTC over stripping the futures regulator of
some of its authority.
   At the Chicago Board of Trade, spokesman Michael O'Connell also
declined comment on the specifics of Brady's proposal but restated
the BOT's position that ``we are against the proposed legislation
and stand by the CFTC as the regulatory body that should oversee
all futures markets.''
   ``We are opposed to anything that weakens the CFTC,'' said John
Damgard, president of the Washington-based Futures Industry
Association.
   Although he hadn't seen Brady's statement, Damgard who was in
Chicago to give a speech, noted: ``I think there's a sense on
Brady's part that he's losing. If this went to a vote right now,
we're pretty confident we would take the day on an up or down
vote.''
   Stock-index futures, often used in program trading strategies by
large institutional investors such as pension funds, allow
investors to trade on the movement of a basket of stocks without
having to buy the underlying stocks.
   The CFTC and the futures industry oppose the administration
bill, saying it would cripple the agency's ability to regulate
other futures products while drying up market liquidity and driving
business out of the country.
   But the SEC and the Treasury Department argue the move is
necessary to curb wild price swings in the stock markets arising
out of price differences between the futures and securities markets.
   ``Stocks and stock-index futures are one market linked together
by electronics,'' said Brady, who first advanced that opinion while
heading a presidential task force that investigated the 1987 stock
market crash.
   He noted that in the 42 years between 1940 and 1982 when stock
index futures first began trading, there were only three instances
when the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by more than 6
percent, while there have been four instances since the 1987 crash.
   In an apparent attempt to allay concerns that the bill is the
first step toward a complete dismantling of the CFTC which oversees
the futures industry, Brady said ``the administration's proposal is
not the proverbial `camel's nose under the tent.'
   ``The way the markets are now functioning makes no further
shifts in regulatory jurisdiction necessary _ not Treasury bond
futures to the SEC, not a full merger of the SEC and CFTC,'' he
said.
   He urged passage of the bill to prevent further market
disruptions.
   Noting that debate on the bill would lead to a political
``bloodletting,'' Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., complained that
the administration should have settled the dispute.
   Instead ``we find ourselves acting as a referee between the SEC
and the CFTC'' which he described as ``two agencies acting like
children.''

<HEAD>SEC To Present Plans for Restrictions on Net Capital Moves</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal securities regulators are exploring
plans for a financial warning system to head off potential troubles
at big brokerage firms like those that sank Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission voted Thursday to seek
public comment on proposed changes in the net capital rule.
   That rule requires broker-dealers to maintain minimum amounts of
cash and assets easily converted into cash to offset the risk of
the securities they trade.
   ``This is not part of a process in which the commission is
seeking to micro-manage or second-guess the management of a either
broker-dealer or its parent,'' SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden said.
   ``This is more in the nature of what I would characterize as a
smoke alarm, a smoke detector,'' he said. ``This is more or less a
corporate equivalent of that.''
   Last February's sudden collapse of the parent company of junk
bond giant Drexel has raised concerns that regulators aren't
getting enough advance notice when the parents of Wall Street firms
withdraw large amounts from capital reserves.
   While financially sound itself, Drexel's brokerage business was
a victim of money woes at its parent Drexel Burnham Lambert Group
Inc. DBL Group filed for bankruptcy court protection after
defaulting on $100 million in short-term debt. The SEC and the New
York Stock Exchange refused to allow it to draw down cash from the
brokerage to repay its debt.
   Breeden said the intent of the rule change ``to give us a chance
to make a quick review of whether a sudden and really enormous _ in
proportion to total capital _ movement of capital is due to
something that's a planned event or due to striking an iceberg.''
   Richard G. Ketchum, director of the SEC's Market Regulation
Division, said there are legitimate reasons like a restructuring
for a parent company to withdraw large amounts of capital.
   The rule change, he said ``is in reaction to situations like
Drexel,'' where the parent company was having major financing
problems.
   He and other SEC officials said their task would be easier by
pending legislation that would give them access to the financial
health of the parent holding companies of broker dealers.
   The proposed rules changes must be reviewed _ and possibly
re-worked _ before the commission can vote on fial passage.
   The proposal would require broker-dealers to give the SEC two
days notice before withdrawing net capital beyond a prescribed
amount, in excess of 20 percent over a 30-day period or 30 percent
within a 90-day period.
   Current rules do not set a time limit for firms to report
capital problems to the SEC, although they must file periodic
disclosure statements. Firms are required to maintain net capital
equalling at least 5 percent of customer-related receivables, and
below 2 percent they must cease operations.
   The proposed rule change also would give the SEC authority to
stop further capital transfers if it determines ``the result would
put the firm in financial jeopardy,'' said Ketchum.
   In addition, the change would upgrade the standard for limiting
capital withdrawals. The standard now is tied to the value of
customer obligations.

<HEAD>French Lodging Company Agrees To Pay $1.3 Billion for Motel 6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judging from its folksy radio ads and cut-rate
conveniences, Motel 6 might be the last place to expect to find the
French.
   Paris-based Accor SA said Thursday it had agreed to pay $1.3
billion in cash for Motel 6 LP in a deal that would make Accor the
world's budget motel leader.
   Analysts said the timing of the proposal was somewhat
surprising, given the generally weak environment for both real
estate and financing. But Accor said it already has arranged
financing for the buyout.
   Securities analyst William S. Fellows of Montgomery Securities
in San Francisco noted that budget chains often benefit during
economic downturns as travelers try to cut costs by choosing less
expensive lodging.
   ``Motel 6 might lose some customers but you have other people
trading down from mid-priced levels,'' he said.
   Accor already owns more than 850 hotels and 3,000 restaurants in
60 countries, including the growing 120-hotel Formula 1 budget
chain in Europe. Its target has been to own 2,000 budget hotels,
and buying Motel 6 with 554 motels would be a big step toward that
goal.
   Motel 6 has carved out a profitable market niche for itself by
emphasizing its low cost _ rooms average about $27 a night _ and
no-frills ambience. Its radio ads end with the signature, ``We'll
leave the light on for you.''
   The company estimated it would have operating income of $220
million on revenue of $475 million this year.
   The deal appears to signal another hefty return for the buyout
specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which led a group that
bought the Motel 6 chain for about $880 million in 1985 and kept a
controlling interest after the company went public a year later.
   Under the terms of the proposal, Accor said it had agreed to
begin a tender offer of $22.50 per share in cash for the more than
55 million outstanding Motel 6 partnership units. Payments for
preferred stock make up the balance.
   An affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis owns more than 50 percent of
Motel 6 and the companies said it has agreed to tender its holdings
under the offer.
   The deal was announced after the stock market closed. Motel 6
units rose $2.62{ a share to $19.25 on volume of 1.5 million shares
in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Paul Dubrule and Gerard Pelisson, co-chairmen of Accor, said the
deal will help their company become the world's pre-eminent budget
hotel company. They said Motel 6 Chief Executive Joseph W. McCarthy
and his management team would stay on, and Motel 6 headquarters
would remain in Dallas.
   The founding partners of Kohlberg Kravis, Henry R. Kravis and
George R. Roberts, said the deal made sense for both sides.
   ``It is appropriate at this time, five years after we began the
process of transforming Motel 6 into a dynamic, modernized and
aggressive economy lodging company, that it become part of a global
lodging company with even greater resources and potential,'' they
said in a statement.
   Kohlberg Kravis and its partners acquired Motel 6 from City
Investing Co. in 1985. The company was converted into a publicly
traded limited master partnership in 1986 with units offered at
$13.50 a share.
   A source close to the firm said investors who bought shares at
that time will have received over $27 per unit for their investment
by the time the Accor deal closes, a 21.5 percernt compounded
annual rate of return counting both the amount of the tender and
the $4.63 a share in cash dividends already paid.
   The source said those who invested in the original buyout did
even better _ a 38 percent compounded annual rate of return on a
$125 million equity investment.
   When Kohlberg bought it in 1985, Motel 6 had 378 motels with
42,279 rooms and 7,000 employees. The chain has since grown to 554
motels, 63,765 rooms and more than 11,500 employees.
   Accor said the deal will makke it the world's largest owner and
operator of hotel rooms, with more than 160,000 rooms worldwide.
Its properties include Sofitel, a luxury chain; Novotel and
Mercure, aimed at business travelers; and Ibis-Urbis, moderately
priced chains.
   Accor estimated it will earn nearly $150 million this year on
sales of more than $4 billion.

<HEAD>South Korean Union Sues U.S. Company for Unpaid Wages</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In an unusual case testing whether federal
labor laws apply to U.S. subsidiaries overseas, a South Korean
union is suing an American manufacturer of cable television
components for more than $1 million in back wages.
   A South Korean union sued Pico Products Inc. in U.S. District
Court on Thursday, alleging breach of contract for shutting down
its South Korean factory and withholding more than $1 million in
wages from workers.
   An attorney for the union, said the lawsuit was the first in
federal court by foreign workers seeking to settle a labor
disagreement.
   The lawsuit accuses Pico, based in Liverpool, N.Y., of suddenly
closing its Pico Korea Ltd. factory in Buchun City in February 1989
to avoid compliance with a collective bargaining agreement.
   The union is seeking back wages and severance it claims are owed
to 294 workers employed by Pico Korea, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Pico.
   Frank E. Deale, legal director of the Center for Constitutional
Rights in New York City, which is representing the South Korean
union, said the lawsuit was filed on the basis of two federal laws.
   They are the Labor Management Relations Act, which gives federal
courts jurisdiction to enforce collective bargaining agreements and
the 1988 Worker Adjustment, Retraining and Notification Act, which
entitles all workers employed by American corporations to 60-day
notice of plant closings.
   Deale said the lawsuit would test whether that law can apply to
employees of a U.S. corporation who work abroad.
   Pico Chairman Bernard Hitchcock repeated claims that union
representatives are ``terrorists'' who kidnapped a company
management team, ransacked the factory and seized its contents, and
extorted unreasonable contract concessions.
   ``They ripped us off for $2 million and stole the company. I'm
through with these people. We're now in court and I'm happy with
that,'' Hitchcock said.
   During their three-month stay in the United States, the union
leaders and a growing number of supporters have picketed Pico's
headquarters regularly.
   Last weekend, they protested outside Hitchcock's home in
Syracuse. Hitchcock responded by standing on his roof and dousing
the demonstrators with water from a garden hose.
   Jum Soon Yoo, president of the South Korean union, and a dozen
other supporters ended a week-long hunger strike with the filing of
the lawsuit.
   Yoo and two other union leaders came to the United States in
April to get Hitchcock to negotiate a settlement after failing to
resolve the dispute in their homeland. Hitchcock has refused to
negotiate with the union.
   Yoo said the union brought the lawsuit because the South Korean
and American governments were ``ignoring the crimes of
multinational firms against Third World workers.''
   The union charged that Pico Korea took advantage of its status
as a foreign firm and enjoyed tax breaks and other benefits offered
by the South Korean government.
   The company grew rapidly after it opened in March 1983. The
workers mobilized in June 1988 to form a union in response to what
they called unsafe working conditions and subminimum wages.
   The union and company reached a labor accord in November 1988
that excluded the issue of wages, which was to be settled through
future talks, according to the lawsuit.
   But before those talks could begin, Hitchcock fired Pico Korea's
top officers and ordered the plant shut down, the lawsuit alleged.
   Union members admitted seizing the plant on Feb. 28, 1989, and
refusing to allow shipment of finished products, but said they did
so to force negotiations.

   Industrialist Armand Hammer methodically
defrauded his wife Frances by deceiving her about her rights to
property amassed during 33 years of marriage, her sole heir
contends in a $700 million damages lawsuit.
   Frances Hammer died in December, leaving her estate to her
niece, Joan Weiss. Mrs. Weiss' husband, Robert Weiss, was named
executor and brought the lawsuit, which also seeks unspecified
punitive damages.
   Among other things, the lawsuit says Mrs. Hammer was tricked
into signing away her interest of at least 50 percent in Hammer's
art collection. Hammer is building a new museum to house the
collection, estimated to be worth up to $450 million.
   But the lawsuit seeks to have Mrs. Hammer's portion of the art
returned and a freeze put on other contested property until its
ownership can be sorted out in court.
   Hammer, 92, the Occidental Petroleum Corp. chairman known for
private world peace crusades and contributions to cancer research,
declined to comment on the lawsuit through a spokesman.
   But interviewed by reporters in April after the company's annual
meeting, Hammer said his third wife, the former Frances Tolman,
``always wanted to keep her estate separate from me.''
   But he seemed to foresee that a lawsuit would be filed. It is
``a matter that will be litigated, I suppose,'' Hammer said.
   By challenging his sole ownership of the art, the complaint
further clouds the future of Hammer's museum, being built beside
Occidental's Los Angeles headquarters. Lawsuits filed by
shareholders already contend Hammer is squandering $100 million in
Occidental funds on a project designed for his own glory.
   The lawsuit, filed in state court in Los Angeles, says Frances
Hammer was a multimillionaire widow when the couple married in
1956. By contrast, Hammer's art gallery and distilling businesses
were struggling, and his income from them was less than his alimony
to two former wives, it says.
   The lawsuit claims that using his wife's fortune as a bankroll,
Hammer invested in Occidental, building it from a company with less
than $80,000 in assets to one of the biggest oil concerns in the
country.
   It says much of Hammer's vast fortune also was built from money
his wife brought to the marriage. Hammer borrowed funds at 2
percent for speculative ventures and often failed to make interest
payments to her, it says. When he did repay her, it was with money
that was their joint property, the lawsuit contends.
   Hammer allowed his wife no control over their property, most of
which should have been jointly held under California law, according
to the lawsuit.
   ``For example, almost all of the Occidental stock acquired by
the Hammers was held in Armand Hammer's name,'' the document says.
   ``Similarly, Armand Hammer exercised complete control over the
many millions of dollars in salary and dividends paid to him by
Occidental, using that money for his own selfish interests and
purposes, including acquiring a vast art collection and making
numerous gifts of community property that were intended primarily
for his self-aggrandizement,'' it says.
   Hammer tricked his wife into signing over her interests in the
art collection, Occidental stock and other property, according to
the lawsuit. It seeks to nullify those agreements.
   It also claims Mrs. Hammer was due at least a half interest in
much of the property. Hammer has contended his wife understood
clearly what she was doing, willingly signing the agreements to
demonstrate there was no community property.
   The 18-count suit, filed Wednesday, alleges fraud, legal
malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty. It accuses the Chicago
law firm of Lewis, Overbeck and Furman of failing to provide
adequate financial advice to Mrs. Hammer, a longtime client.
   David J. Creagan Jr., a partner in the law firm, which also is
named as a defendant, said he hadn't seen the complaint and
couldn't comment on its specifics. But he denied wrongdoing in
dealing with Mrs. Hammer.
   ``All I can say is that we fairly represented her interests
during the time we had the privilege of doing so,'' Creagan said.
   Also named as defendants are Occidental; the Armand Hammer
Foundation; and the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural
Center, where Hammer's art collection is to be housed.
   Occidental spokesman Roger Gillott said neither Hammer nor
officials of the trust and museum would have any comment on the
lawsuit.
   Of the $700 million in damages, a total of $400 million is
sought from Hammer and the law firm and another $300 million from
the foundation, museum and oil company combined.

<HEAD>Jury Believed Boesky _ At Least in Part</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury believed the testimony of Ivan
Boesky _ at least in part _ against former stock speculator John A.
Mulheren Jr. despite courtoom attacks on the admitted inside
trader, securities experts said.
   Jurors in federal court in Manhattan convicted Mulheren of four
counts of conspiracy and stock manipulation stemming from dealings
with Boesky in 1985 but failed to reached a verdict on 26 other
counts.
   U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum dismissed the panel
and declared a mistrial on the undecided charges Thursday after
nine days of deliberations failed to yield a verdict.
   The conviction of the flamboyant Mulheren on the four counts,
returned Tuesday, marked another victory for the government.
   Juries have returned guilty verdicts against the principal
defendants in all but one of about a dozen cases in prosecutors'
four-year crackdown on Wall Street fraud. Many defendants have
pleaded guilty rather than face trial.
   Mulheren's conviction also followed another pattern, securities
experts said, in that the jury convicted on charges that contained
a clear victim of fraud, in this case involving the manipulation of
Gulf &amp; Western Inc. stock.
   They appeared stymied, however, on more technical allegations of
``stock parking,'' a violation that before the recent wave of cases
typically was prosecuted as a civil rather than criminal violation.
   Prosecutors had charged Mulheren bought 75,000 Gulf &amp; Western
shares at Boesky's behest, driving the stock to $45 a share, the
price at which Boesky wanted to sell about 3.5 million shares back
to the company.
   The jury was hung up on charges that Mulheren secretly held
large blocks of stock to help Boesky evade taxes and federal
securities disclosure laws.
   ``The jury obviously believed Boesky on the most central
transaction,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law professor
at Columbia University.
   ``They convicted on on the story that had the clearest motive
and clearest sense of injury,'' Coffee said. ``Gulf and Western you
can understand _ there is a victim there who has been defrauded.
The company paid too much.''
   ``Stock parking is more of a regulatory crime,'' he said.
Parking refers to the illegal practice of disguising ownership of
securities to avoid federal reporting requirements.
   Mulheren, 41, was an aggressive and successful trader of stocks
of companies targeted for takeover before he was implicated in 1988
in the government's fraud investigation by Boesky, a former friend
and associate.
   His trial in federal court in Manhattan was marked by Boesky's
first public testimony under his settlement with investigators.
Boesky spent two years in prison and paid $100 million in penalties
to settle insider trading charges.
   Defense attorney Thomas Puccio's main tactic was to try to
discredit Boesky as a repeat liar who was motivated to say anything
to fulfill his promise to assist federal authorities in exchange
for leniency. In his summation, Puccio called Boesky ``a pile of
human garbage.''
   After the mistrial, Mulheren joked with supporters, reflecting a
casual demeanor that was his trademark on Wall Street and in court.
Mulheren has said he went to trial, unlike others implicated by
Boesky in wrongdoing, as a matter of principle.
   ``Lots of money spent and no answer given,'' he said.
   Prosecutors said they could not immediately comment on whether
they planned to retry Mulheren on the oustanding counts of
securities fraud, mail fraud and record-keeping violations.
   ``We're very satisfied with the verdict,'' Assistant U.S.
Attorney Scott Gilbert said.
   Cedarbaum scheduled an Oct. 5 sentencing for the four counts on
which Mulheren was convicted. He faces up to five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine on each count.
   Puccio said he planned to appeal the verdict.
   Co-defendant Leonard DeStefano, 34, a former trader at
Mulheren's defunct firm Jamie Securities, was acquitted of all
conspiracy and record-keeping violations charges brought against
him.

   The U.S. dollar fell to a 4{-month low against the
Japanese yen while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended
the week slightly higher.
   The dollar closed the week at 147.42 yen, down 1.48 yen from
Thursday's close, the lowest close since Feb. 22. The dollar has
fallen 3.58 yen in the last six trading days.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's plunge followed its slide in
New York trading Thursday. The downward trend was triggered by a
statement by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
that the Fed might consider easing interest rates, they said.
   Lower U.S. interest rates tend to make the dollar less
attractive to foreign investors.
   ``The Fed chairman's statement has an impact on the exchange
market,`` said Masaya Ueno, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   Separately, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
gained 69.05 points, or 0.21 percent, to 32,644.37. The index rose
281.14 points on Thursday.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 500 million shares,
up from Thursday's 430 million shares.
   Share prices sagged after opening firmly. ``The market lacked
buying interest to support gains,`` said Daiwa Securities dealer
Kazuyuki Suzuki.
   He said many dealers felt the yen's strength was only temporary
because the bond market reacted mildly to Greenspan's remarks.

   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan's suggestion that interest rates will head lower couldn't
come at a better time for President Bush.
   In a rare public disclosure of the central bank's intentions,
Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday the Fed may
have to nudge rates down in response to mounting evidence that
banks are being stingier with loans.
   That was a sharp reversal from his assessment only three weeks
ago, when he said the lending squeeze hadn't yet developed into a
broad-based credit crunch affecting the national economy.
   Whatever the reason, the shift in central bank policy is sure to
please the president, who has been pushing for lower interest rates
for months.
   The administration needs lower rates to counteract the dampening
effect on the economy if Congress and the White House lower
spending and raise taxes as part of a budget deficit reduction pact.
   A few days before the central bank's midyear policy review on
July 2 and 3, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady urged it not to
wait for a budget agreement before cutting rates.
   Bush mentioned the subject as recently as Wednesday in a news
conference in Houston. Greenspan met earlier this week with worried
Senate Republicans.
   Business owners have been saying since last winter that banks
have tightened lending standards in response to the savings and
loan crisis, a softer economy and weakening real estate markets.
   Greenspan said the first statistical evidence backing their
contention may be emerging. He pointed to slow growth in the money
supply and an increase in average interest rates on commercial
loans.
   ``If that is in fact the case, it could have undesirable effects
on the economy that the Federal Reserve would have to consider
offsetting using monetary policy,'' he said.
   Such a shift would produce ``a very modest change in the level
of the federal funds rate,'' the key rate banks charge among
themselves for overnight loans, he said.
   Stock and bond markets rallied after Greenspan's comments. The
Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks jumped 37.13 to 2,969.80,
a record high.
   It is rare for the central bank chairman to so strongly signal
the future direction of interest rates. Usually he declines comment
on the subject or uses deliberately ambiguous language.
   ``I can't remember any Fed chairman ever doing something like
this,'' said economist Michael K. Evans, a Washington-based
consultant. ``In my recollection this is an absolute first.''
   Evans pointed out that Greenspan's four-year term as chairman
expires in 13 months.
   ``I guess he's scared for his life. ... The implied threat (from
the administration) is `Hey kid, if you want your job, play ball.'
Nobody's as crude as that but that's what it amounts to,'' he said.
   In response to a question about political pressure from Sen.
Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., Greenspan said the Federal Reserve welcomed
comments from the administration or anyone else who can supply new
insight. But, he said, members of the Fed make their decisions
independently.
   Economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. Inc., a
government securities dealer in New York, said Greenspan may indeed
be feeling political heat, but he said he believes the chairman's
concern about the credit crunch is genuine.
   ``What Greenspan is saying is `If I don't do something now, it
could make what is already a very soft economy worse,''' Jones said.
   Many analysts believe it may already be too late to give the
economy the kind of boost the White House wants to bolster
Republican chances in the November congressional elections. A
change in monetary policy can take as long as six months to ripple
through the economy.
   Jones said he expects the Fed to cut rates by late July.
Virtually announcing the move in advance allows Greenspan to focus
attention on the reasons he prefers to highlight and shift
attention from other reasons, he said.
   ``The Fed wants to link this easing to the credit crunch and not
to any political factors,'' he said.

   Not since Congress declared war on drugs have
lawmakers found such a tempting target. Democrats and Republicans
now are raining fire on a common target: tax-dodging foreign
corporations.
   ``What we have here is the granddaddy of tax avoidance,'' Rep.
Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., said.
   Lawmakers see big bucks at stake _ money that could be used to
cut the budget deficit without imposing on individuals. Some
members of Congress insist the government is being cheated of as
much as $50 billion a year, although Bush administration officials
are skeptical.
   Whatever the figure, the prospect of reining in big-time cheats
was enough to unite such diverse politicians as House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Rep.
Duncan Hunter of California, chairman of the House Republican
Research Committee.
   ``Before we raise taxes,'' Gephardt told the House Ways and
Means oversight subcommittee Thursday, ``we should look at the
profitable operations of foreign-controlled corporations that don't
pay any at all.''
   Hunter released a list of Japanese companies, compiled from
newspaper reports, that he said are being investigated by the
Internal Revenue Service on suspicion their U.S. subsidiaries have
underpaid. The list included such well-known giants as Sony,
Hitachi, Toshiba, Nissan, Toyota, Yamaha and Matsushita (Panasonic).
   ``American citizens who conspire to defraud the government of
large amounts of tax money stand a good chance of going to jail,''
Hunter said. ``The same should be true of any foreigner who takes
advantage of our open market but defrauds the American government
of tax money.''
   The IRS told the subcommittee earlier in the week that in 1987,
the nearly 45,000 foreign-controlled U.S. corporations had receipts
totaling $686 billion and paid income tax of only 0.66 percent of
that total. U.S.-owned companies paid a 1.04 percent rate.
   For nine months the subcommittee has been investigating 36
foreign-controlled subsidiaries and found that over a 10-year
period, most of them paid little or no U.S. income tax.
   The chief means of avoiding tax was through ``transfer
pricing.'' By manipulating prices at which it sells goods to its
U.S. subsidiaries, a foreign company could significantly reduce the
amount of taxable income subject to U.S. tax.
   ``I propose we're talking about billions _ in the range of $30
billion'' a year in tax avoidance, Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, the
subcommittee chairman, said Thursday. Other members put the figure
at $50 billion.
   ``We really do not have a way of estimating'' the tax loss,
Kenneth Gideon, assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, said.
``I would find $50 billion very hard to accept,'' since the U.S.
take from all corporations is only about twice that figure.
   Are foreign-controlled corporations paying their share, Rep.
Ronnie Flippo, D-Ala., demanded.
   ``That's a question I can't answer,'' Gideon replied.
Nevertheless, he added, the situation is unclear enough to justify
careful examination.
   ``In many case what we have is criminal conduct,'' Rep. Clay
Shaw, R-Fla., said.
   ``The outrage this committee feels ... I don't think I could
overstate,'' Rep. Ray McGrath, R-N.Y., said.
   ``These companies are paying less than the average citizen, the
average taxpayers of the United States,'' Rep. Richard Schulze,
R-Pa., said. ``That's abominable.''

   The Federal Communications Commission says it
needs to extend the current daytime ban on ``indecent'' radio and
television programs to 24 hours to fully protect young eyes and
ears.
   The agency on Thursday said children under 18 are in the
viewing-listening audience 24 hours a day and that lock boxes or
parental supervision are not enough to ensure that they don't watch
indecent programs. It said a round-the-clock indecency ban would
not violate broadcasters' First Amendment rights.
   The commission voted 5-0 to report its conclusions to a federal
appeals court here that is considering a 24-hour ban the FCC
adopted under orders from Congress in 1988.
   The report will not change current FCC indecency regulations,
but it could play a major role in how the appeals court _ and,
ultimately, the Supreme Court _ decides the issue.
   Commissioner Ervin S. Duggan said the FCC had received 88,000
letters complaining about indecent programming. He read from a
letter from a mother who said it would take a ``superhuman'' effort
for parents to monitor what their children hear on see on radio and
TV at all times.
   ``The people who write letters like that are not enemies of the
Constitution,'' Duggan said. ``They are people like you and me. ...
They are parents.''
   Opponents attacked the commission's action immediately.
   ``What adults should be able to hear or see should not be
determined by what children's needs are,'' said Andrew J.
Schwartzman, an attorney for People for the American Way, one of
the activist groups challenging the 24-hour ban.
   ``I think it's preposterous,'' said Peggy Charren of
Boston-based Action for Children's Television, the main plaintiff
in the court challenge. ``Protecting children from indecency should
not be the role of the FCC. That should be the role of parents.''
   Currently, obscene material is banned from the airwaves at all
times and indecent material from about 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.
   The FCC defines indecent as language or material ``that depicts
or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual
or excretory activities or organs.''
   The FCC under its new chairman, Alfred Sikes, has in the past
year put the nation's radio stations on notice it will not tolerate
the broadcast of indecent programs before 8 p.m. It has fined
several stations already for broadcasting sexually explicit
material.
   Sikes said Thursday that in seeking a 24-hour ban, the FCC
simply was reflecting the will of Congress and the American public.
   ``We've received a huge amount of mail ... and it seems the
public strongly supports the action we're taking today,'' he said.
   FCC officials repeatedly refused to speculate on what types of
TV programs could be considered indecent. The commission in June
1988 fined a Kansas City, Mo., TV station $2,000 for showing an
allegedly indecent film, ``Private Lessons,'' at 8 p.m. At that
time, the FCC had established an after-midnight ``safe harbor'' for
indecent programs.
   However, the FCC vacated the fine when the appeals court in July
1988 ordered the commission to study the time-of-day issue further.
   In its report, the FCC said a 24-hour indecency ban promotes a
``compelling'' government interest and was ``narrowly tailored'' to
serve that interest without infringing broadcasters' First
Amendment rights.
   The commission said it was guided by a 1989 Supreme Court ruling
that used the ``compelling interest-narrowly tailored'' argument in
deciding that the government had the right to regulate indecent
telephone transmissions.
   Congress in 1988 ordered the FCC to adopt a round-the-clock ban
on indecency, and it did. But broadcasters and free-speech groups
challenged the rules, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia in January 1989 stayed implementation of the
24-hour ban pending further review.
   The court said the FCC could develop evidence supporting a
24-hour ban.

   Consumer advocates and industry officials
agree shoppers would find it easier to learn the nutrition content
of nearly all foods in the grocery store under a new government
proposal to overhaul food labeling.
   Shoppers would be able to tell at a glance the amount of
saturted fat, calories from fat, cholesterol and fiber. Serving
sizes would be standardized, so nutrient comparisons would be more
meaningful.
   But this doesn't assure the proposal's smooth sailing, among the
public or within the Bush administration.
   ``It's a step in the right direction, but it's a long road, and
the question isn't what they're proposing but whether they'll ever
finalize it,'' said Ellen Haas, executive director of the consumer
group, Public Voice for Food &amp; Health Policy.
   Past efforts by the Food and Drug Administration to change the
food-labeling system stalled, which prompted action in Congress.
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
are sponsoring bills that would accomplish many of the same things
the regulation would.
   On Thursday, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
outlined the latest effort to make sweeping changes in the system,
to be published in 400 pages of the Federal Register next week.
   The proposals would:
   _Require nutrition labeling for most packaged foods as well as
fresh produce and seafood.
   _Require labels to include saturated fat, calories from fat,
cholesterol and fiber.
   _Establish standardized serving sizes for 159 food categories.
   _Restrict use of the terms ``no cholesterol,'' ``low
cholesterol'' and ``reduced cholesterol.''
   Food industry representatives applauded the effort, and said
they will continue pressing to have the regulations applied
uniformly nationwide.
   The issue held up announcement of the regulations late last
month because of a disagreement within the administration,
according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Health and Human Services Department wanted uniform rules,
but White House reportedly officials objected, saying states should
be allowed to build their own regulations onto the federal ones.
   To get the proposed regulations published and begin the
administrative rule-making process, the uniformity language was
stripped from the proposal and the issue instead was posed as a
question for comment.
   ``Without uniform labeling there will be consumer confusion and
distribution chaos,'' said C. Manly Molpus, president of the
Grocery Manufacturers of America.
   Under the proposed regulation, nutrition labels would have to
appear on product packages. For fresh produce and seafood,
nutrition information could be available at the point of purchase,
such as in brochures or on posters.
   Listing of the thiamin, riboflavin and niacin _ now required _
would become optional, and listing of protein would be required
only for food intended for infants and very young children.
   To be called ``cholesterol free,'' a product would have to have
less than two grams of saturated fat, less than five grams of total
fat and less than two milligrams of cholesterol. A food meeting the
targets on fat but with two to 20 milligrams of cholesterol could
be called ``low cholesterol.''
   A manufacturer could claim a food had ``reduced cholesterol'' if
its cholesterol was cut by at least 75 percent. It could also make
that claim if the reduction was compared with other foods on the
market, but the comparison would have to be explained on the label.
   ``The axiom here is truth in labeling,'' said acting FDA
Commissioner James Benson.
   HHS set a 30-day comment period on the cholesterol rule and said
it could become final by the fall. Manufacturers would then have
one year to comply.
   A 120-day comment period was set for the regulations on
nutritional labeling, intake references and serving size. Benson
said he hoped a final regulation could be issued by next spring.
The industry would have a year to comply.
   Exemptions to the labeling rule would include restaurants,
bakeries, cafeterias, bite-size foods and foods that have less than
40 calories per serving, do not make a health claim and have no
meaningful supply of nutrients.

<HEAD>Debt-for-Nature Swap To Help Save Lemurs And Forests of Madagascar</HEAD>

   A novel deal called a debt-for-nature swap will
pay for a $5 million conservation program in Madagascar, where
destruction of exotic forests threatens wildlife found nowhere else.
   Among the forests' inhabitants are 43 varieties of lemurs,
tree-dwelling human relatives that live only on Madagascar, an
island off the southeast coast of Africa.
   Eighty percent of their habitat has been wiped out.
   Washington, D.C.-based Conservation International, which
negotiated the debt swap, has pledged to pay off $5 million of
Madagascar's debt to commercial banks, said spokesman Roderic Mast.
   ``We consider Madagascar to be one of the highest conservation
priorities in the world,'' Mast said Thursday.
   A first-ever combination of debt reduction and trade credits
will enable the environmental group to get better than double value
for the cash it pays.
   Madagascar's end of the bargain is to begin a five-year
conservation and protection program staffed by its own people under
the direction of Conservation International.
   Madagascar is an island about 40 percent larger than California.
It contains some of the world's most threatened wild habitat.
   Eighty percent of Madagascar's forests have been lost to
encroachment by poor farmers struggling to eke out a living. The
remaining forest contains 150,000 to 200,000 species of plants and
animals. About three-quarters are found only in Madagascar.
   Last year, the World Wildlife Fund negotiated a $3 million
debt-for-nature swap with Madagascar, Africa's first such
agreement. The first debt-for-nature swap was negotiated by
Conservation International in Bolivia in July 1987.
   ``The government of Madagascar has shown its commitment to
saving its own wildlife,'' Mast said. ``They're taking a real
leadership role, in terms of African countries, in showing this
strong commitment to preserving their natural heritage.''
   The new agreement is unusual for two reasons. The United Nations
Development Program is considering providing much of the money, the
first time the U.N. has joined in a debt-for-nature swap. And the
agreement may let Madagascar reduce its debts to foreign companies
as well as its commercial bank debt.
   Under the accord, foreign companies that have sold goods to
Madagascar and haven't been paid could be paid off in exchange for
further government commitments to conservation.
   Conservation International officials are hoping that some
companies will agree simply to forgive the debts, in effect
donating the money to the conservation effort in Madagascar.
   ``This is the first ever debt-for-nature swap that I'm aware of
involving trade credits as well as bank debt,'' said Steven Rubin,
Conservation International's director of business and legal
affairs. ``We're effectively bringing private companies into the
cause of ecosystem preservation in Madagascar.''
   Debt-for-nature swaps have appeared only in the last few years.
The legal and financial underpinnings of the swaps are complex, but
their intent is to get conservation groups more bang for the buck.
   In this swap, for example, Conservation International will use
money it raises from the U.N. or elsewhere to pay off portions of
Madagascar's foreign debt and trade deficit at less than face value.
   At current rates, $1 million in debt can be paid off for about
$400,000. Banks are willing to accept less than what they are owed
so they can close the books on their loans.
   For each $1 million paid off, the government agrees to use $1
million worth of its own currency _ which banks generally won't
accept as payment _ to finance conservation.
   The result is that $400,000 raised by an environmental group
results in $1 million worth of Madagascar's currency spent on
conservation.

<HEAD>FAA Says Requiring Child Safety Seats on Airlines Would Cost Lives</HEAD>

   Requiring child safety seats on airliners for
infants instead of continuing to let parents hold them on their
laps would cost more lives than it would save, the Federal Aviation
Administration maintains.
   The FAA on Thursday cited past experience to estimate that such
a requirement would save only one child's life over the next decade
_ but at an additional cost of $3 billion to families who fly.
   ``While the chance of survival aboard an airplane may be
slightly improved, the costs associated with mandating the carriage
of a child in a separate seat will divert a significant number of
families from ... air travel to far less safe travel by
automobile,'' said Associate FAA Administrator Anthony J. Broderick.
   However, sponsors of House and Senate bills that would require
the FAA to mandate child safety restraints on airliners attacked
the study as ``specious'' and vowed to press ahead with their
legislation.
   ``It's in the airlines' economic interest to keep families
flying,'' Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., told the House
Transportation Committee's aviation subcommittee. ``And in order to
do so, I believe they will establish fares for infants that are
reasonable.''
   Infants under age 2 now may fly free by traveling on the laps of
a parent or guardian. All of the major airlines also allow infants
to travel in safety seats attached to a regular seat at the reduced
80 percent fare customarily charged for children between ages 2 and
12.
   Testifying before a House subcommittee, Broderick said the study
commissioned by the FAA concluded that requiring safety seats for
infants would increase their families' average air fare by 31
percent or $185.
   Those higher costs, the study said, would cause about 20 percent
of the families now using airlines for long-distance trips to
instead drive or stay at home, which also would expose them to
higher risks associated with increased local travel.
   The increased auto traffic would produce at least nine
additional highway deaths, 52 serious injuries and more than 2,300
minor injuries, the study said.
   Companion bills by Bond in the Senate and Rep. Jim Lightfoot,
R-Iowa, in the House to mandate the use of child safety seats on
airliners are supported by the industry's chief trade organization,
the Air Transport Association, as well as airline unions and
consumer safety groups.
   ATA Vice President Walter Coleman said it would be ``foolish''
to think that the airlines would not discount ticket prices for the
infant seats in an effort to keep their parents' business.
   The FAA study estimated that measure would raise annual airline
revenue by $80 million to $119 million _ depending on whether the
carriers charge an 80 percent reduced fare for the toddlers' seats
or a 50 percent reduced fare.
   The legislation was prompted by the crash-landing a year ago of
a United Airliners jet at Sioux City, Iowa, killing 112 aboard,
including a 23-month-old child. Three other children under age 2
were injured.
   As the result of its investigation into that crash, the National
Transportation Safety Board recommended to the FAA in May that
child safety seats be required for all children less than 40 pounds
in weight and 3 feet, 4 inches in height.
   Susan Coughlin, the board's vice chairman, aid the FAA's policy
of allowing infants to be held in an adult's arms, while everyone
else must wear seat belts, was a ``contradiction of basic safety
principles.''
   The FAA study said the death of the child in the Sioux City
crash was the only one of 10 infant deaths in aviation accidents
over the past 12 years that could have been prevented by the use of
a child safety seat.
   Of the 16 infant injuries in those accidents since 1978, only
three to six of them would have been prevented by the use of child
restraints, the study said.

   The U.S. dollar slumped in European trading this
morning, undermined by a hint that U.S. interest rates may be going
down.
   Gold rose strongly.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's fall continued a drop that
began in New York trading Thursday, following a statement by U.S.
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that the Fed might
consider easing interest rates.
   Lower rates would make dollar-denominated investments less
attractive.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to its lowest level since Feb. 22,
closing at 147.42 yen, down 1.48 yen from Thursday. Later in
London, the dollar firmed to 147.80 yen.
   The British pound traded at $1.8020, from $1.7995 late Thursday.
   Other midday dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Thursday's rates included: 1.6470 West German marks, down from
1.6525; 1.3970 Swiss francs, down from 1.4020; 5.5285 French
francs, down from 5.5460; 1,206.00 Italian lire, down from
1,211.00; 1.1564 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1580.
   The Dutch guilder rate was unavailable.
   Gold, which rallied Thursday on Greenspan's hint and amid
stronger world oil prices, moved higher in early London dealings on
the back of what dealers link to at least two waves of Middle East
buying.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $359.10 per
troy ounce this morning, up from $351.75 bid a troy ounce late
Thursday.
   In Zurich, gold traded at $359.10 per ounce, up from $351.60
late Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $5.56 an ounce to close at $359.94.
   Silver bullion opened in London at a bid $4.89 a troy ounce, up
from $4.86 dollars late Thursday.

   Share prices were higher at midday Friday after
the government announced that the rate of inflation remained below
10 percent.
   The government said inflation rose to 9.8 percent in June from
9.7 percent in May, the government said.
   Dealers said the market was relieved that the rate had not moved
to 10 percent or higher.
   Stock prices opened higher on Wall Street's performance Thursday
following hints from U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan that interest rates should come down to counter tight
credit.
   At midday local time, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index
was up 1.1 points, or 0.046 percent, at 2,371.6.
   The narrower 30-share index was up 3.3 points or 0.2 percent at

   Britain's inflation rate rose to 9.8 percent in
June from 9.7 percent in May, the government said Friday.
   It was the highest rate since inflation hit 10.4 percent in
March 1982, the government said.
   However, the government said the underlying rate _ excluding
mortgage payments and local taxes _ stood at 6.9 percent in June,
down from 7 percent in May.
   Inflation was spurred by increases in charges for electricity
and for maintaining automobiles, the Central Statistics Office said.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, the Treasury secretary,
said: ``The figure is a good deal higher than I would wish to see
it, and I shall be content only when it begins to come down.''
   He told BBC radio that ``it's wholly wrong to say we are off
course. Certainly it is taking a little longer to come down than we
imagined.''

<HEAD>Pathe Brings $500 Million Countersuit Against Time Warner</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pathe Communications Corp. has countersued
Time Warner Inc., escalating the bitter dispute over Pathe's
collapsed attempts to negotiate a loan for its buyout of MGM-UA
Communications Co.
   Time Warner now is unlikely to participate in the planned
purchase of MGM-UA and Pathe is seeking new financial partners,
spokesman Craig Parsons said Thursday.
   The lawsuit, seeking damages in excess of $500 million, alleges
breach of contract, fraud, libel, interference with contractual
relationship and unfair competition. It was filed in state court in
Los Angeles in response to Time Warner's $100 million
breach-of-contract lawsuit against Pathe filed June 29.
   In April, Time Warner had agreed to lend Pathe $650 million,
half the $1.3 billion purchase price for MGM-UA.
   Time Warner insisted that none of the rest of the money for the
deal should be borrowed and that Pathe, a motion picture production
company, should come up with $450 million equity on its own.
   Time Warner's lawsuit also claimed Pathe Chairman Giancarlo
Parretti misled Time Warner regarding the video and theatrical
rights to certain films.
   Pathe's attempted purchase of MGM-UA has been troubled since it
was first announced in March. Time Warner's financial involvement
was one of the few solid components in a hodgepodge financial
arrangement Pathe was assembling for the purchase of the historic
studio.
   Time Warner and its subsidiaries also were to get a lien on the
valuable United Artists library as part of the deal, as well as
distribution rights to films from the Pathe and MGM-UA studios.
   Ed Adler, a spokesman for Time Warner, said the suit was Pathe's
``latest attempt to divert attention from the facts, which are that
Pathe breached its April 1990 agreement with Time Warner, its
theatrical distribution agreement with Warner Bros. and a video
rights distribution agreement with Warner Home Video.''

   The planned $6 billion takeover of Atlanta-based
Contel, the nation's third-largest independent telephone company,
by No. 1 GTE Corp. will give GTE a big boost in the cellular phone
business at a good price, an industry analyst says.
   ``They are making a very wise move for the company's long-term
future,'' telecommunications analyst Frederick Moran, of Moran and
Associates in Greenwich, Conn, said of GTE. ``They are buying
Contel for less than half of what it's worth.
   ``We value Contel at $81 to $87 a share. ... If I were running
Contel, I wouldn't have agreed to it.''
   In the deal, announced Thursday, GTE would exchange 1.27 shares
of its common stock for each of Contel's 159 million shares. That
values Contel stock at about $37.78 a share at the Thursday closing
price of GTE stock of $29.75, down $1.25.
   Contel shares rose $7.25 on the news Thursday to close at $35.25
in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Moran said the deal raises the question of whether another
company ``will step in and offer a higher price than GTE has
offered.''
   The merger, which the companies described as tax free, is
subject to the approval of both companies' stockholders, and by
regulatory agencies.
   The merger would result in the country's second-largest cellular
phone system operator after McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., and
the nation's largest local-exchange telephone company.
   In a joint announcement with Contel, GTE Chairman James L.
``Rocky'' Johnson characterized the merger as ``a perfect
combination of two great companies.''
   Contel provides a broad range of telecommunications products and
services. For 1989, Contel reported record earnings of $287 million
or $1.80 a share, up 4 percent from a year earlier, on revenue of
$3.1 billion.
   ``This merger will provide the critical mass and financial
strength Contel has sought in order to accelerate the many
initiatives we have recently taken across a wide spectrum of
ventures,'' Contel Chairman Charles Wohlstetter said in the
statement.
   GTE, based in Stamford, Conn., is the nation's largest
independent operator of phone systems, providing service to more
than 14 million customers in 31 states. It also provides cellular
phone service in 34 metropolitan areas, and operates a satellite
communications network.
   Since deregulation, much consolidation has occurred among
smaller phone companies, but this is the first deal of this size,
said Theodore J. Moreau, an analyst with Robert W. Baird in
Milwaukee.
   ``This may be the test to see how the regulators view this kind
of deal,'' he said.
   In other telephone industry consolidations this year, McCaw
bought control of cellular phone operator Lin Broadcasting Corp.
for $3.4 billion, MCI Communications Corp. bought the long distance
company Telecom USA Inc. for $1.25 billion, and GTE said it would
buy the cellular phone operations of Providence Journal Co. for
$710 million.
   Last month, Contel announced it wanted to sell Contel Office
Communications, a division that provides shared telecommunications
services for tenants of high-rise office buildings. This spring,
the company announced it was restructuring its telephone
operations, which provide 74 percent of revenues, to eliminate
about 600 jobs nationwide.

   Retail sales, bolstered by a big jump in
department store sales, shot up 0.5 percent in June, posting the
first increase in five months, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said sales rose to a seasonally adjusted
$147.82 billion last month, up $784 million from the May sales
level.
   The June increase came after a string of three consecutive
declines, something that had not happened since 1981, during the
last recession.
   Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total
economic activity, prolonged weakness in this area raises fears
that the economy could be headed for a downturn.
   The June rebound should lessen recession anxieties, but analysts
cautioned against reading too much into one-month's change,
especially given the fact that retail sales had been sluggish for
most of this year.
   This was the first increase since a big 2.8 percent increase in
January. After that gain, retail sales showed no change in February
and then fell 0.4 percent in March, 1 percent in April and 0.6
percent in May.
   With job growth very weak this year, consumer confidence about
the future has slipped and resulted in spending cutbacks,
especially for big-ticket items such as cars and appliances.
   The June increase was led by a 2.8 percent rise in spending at
department stores, reflecting a rebound after a big 2.2 percent
drop in May.
   The 2.8 percent jump in department store sales was dramatic,
given the fact that sales in this sector had fallen for three
months, but analysts attributed part of the gain to price markdowns
to encourage purchases of slow-moving summer clothes.
   Auto sales edged up a tiny 0.1 percent in June after being down
0.2 percent in May. Weakness in auto sales has been a major factor
contributing to the overall sluggishness of consumer spending this
year.
   Sales at building material and hardware stores rose 1.3 percent
after falling 0.2 percent in April.
   Bucking the upward trend in June, sales at furniture and home
furnishings stores plunged 1.9 percent. They had been up a slight
0.4 percent in May.
   Sales at grocery stores were up 0.3 percent while sales at
gasoline stations climbed by 0.5 percent. Sales at drug stores were
up 1.2 percent but spending at bars and restaurants fell 0.6
percent in June.

<HEAD>Mercedes-Benz Negotiating to Add Shifts to Meet Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Mercedes-Benz AG confirmed
Friday that the company is negotiating with unions to add special
shifts at a number of its factories to help meet rising demand from
East Germany and elsewhere.
   The auto making arm of Daimler-Benz AG, West Germany's largest
industrial concern, is negotiating with the Workers' Council and
unions for permission to add weekend shifts.
   The official said that an announcement could be made later
Friday, or perhaps by Monday. But he cautioned that so far no
agreement has been reached. He added that attempts to add weekend
shifts in January were thwarted by the unions.
   Mercedes-Benz had planned to build about 556,000 passenger cars
this year, up from 542,000 produced in 1989. But the spokesman said
that rising demand from East Germany, Western European markets and
from Japan has prompted the company to boost production goals for
the year to 570,000.
   ``We would very much like to introduce special shifts,'' the
spokesman said in a telephone interview. ``But this must be agreed
upon with the Workers' Councils.''
   The official said that demand from East Germany, in particular,
has been greater than expected. He noted that Mercedes-Benz
recently received an order for 500 new taxis for East Germany, to
be delivered by the end of September.
   ``But it's not just East Germany, it's the domestic market in
general as well that's quite strong,'' he said.
   He added that sales in Japan during the first half of the year
were up by about 40 percent from a year earlier. The company's goal
for the U.S. market is to maintain last year's sales level, when it
sold about 75,000 passenger cars, the spokesman said.
   Mercedes-Benz currently operates two shifts: one between 6 a.m.
and 2 p.m. local time and the second shift between 2 p.m. and 10
p.m. local time. He said that it was unlikely night shifts would be
introduced.

<TEXT>
   Production cutbacks by
two OPEC members should restore oil prices to the $18-a-barrel
benchmark within days, Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh
said Friday.
   Speaking to reporters at the end of a two-day visit to the
United Arab Emirates, he said production cuts by the United Arab
Emirates and Kuwait will drive the prices up before the next OPEC
meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, on July 25.
   At the meeting, Iran will request that the benchmark price be
increased by $2 a barrel to $20, the minister said.
   Aqazadeh's remarks reflect confidence that OPEC members would
refrain from pumping too much oil, which depresses prices. Oil
produced by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries was selling recently for $14 a barrel.
   During his visit, Aqazadeh held talks with Oil Minister Mana
Saeed Otaiba.
   ``We're expecting prices to reach $18 a barrel by the time we
meet in Geneva, and then we will propose an increase of $2 in the
reference price,'' said Aqazadeh at Abu Dhabi airport.
   ``U.A.E. is dropping its output by 400,000 barrels per day and
Kuwait by 500,000 barrels per day, and this will lead to a (price)
hike,'' Aqazadeh said.
   Oil prices have already traded above $18 this week on New York
and other markets, but OPEC determines its reference price by
averaging the prices of seven separate crudes.
   Otaiba, who also spoke at the airport while seeing his guest
off, said the U.A.E. output reduction will be effective as of the
day.
   There was no official comment on the cutback reports from
Kuwait, another OPEC member that has been producing well beyond its
quota of 1.5 million barrels a day.
   OPEC offered the U.A.E. a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day at
its last meeting in Vienna in November, but the U.A.E. rejected the
figure as too low.
   At that meeting, the collective production ceiling at 22.086
million barrels a day, within which the U.A.E.'s output was
calculated at only 1.095 million barrels a day.
   But OPEC production in June was estimated at 23.2 million
barrels per day.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's chief oil exporter and a leading OPEC
member, was expected to reciprocate for the efforts by the U.A.E.
and Kuwait to stabilize the oil market, according to senior gulf
oil executives in Manama, Bahrain.
   They said they expected the kingdom to demand that its
production quota make up 24.45 percent of OPEC's ceiling.
   News of the planned production cutbacks surfaced in Saudi Arabia
Thursday night. Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer described
the moves as a ``historic crossroads'' for the 13-member cartel.
   He said the decisions followed high-level contacts between King
Fahd and U.A.E. President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.
   Iran and Iraq, their economies battered by the gulf war, have
been lobbying for higher prices of crude oil. Both countries have
been critical of Kuwait and the U.A.E. for overproducing and
causing a glut on the oil market.

   Declining food and energy prices helped hold
wholesale price inflation to a modest 0.2 percent in June, despite
a worrisome jump in the cost of other items, the government said
today.
   The rise in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index for
finished goods one stop short of the retail level followed a rise
in May of 0.3 percent.
   It brought wholesale inflation for the first half of 1990 to an
annual rate of 3.7 percent, compared with 4.8 percent for all of
1989.
   The number was about what economists anticipated. However,
prices for items outside the volatile food and energy sectors
jumped 0.6 percent in June, the steepest incrase in a year and
about double the expected rise.
   Analysts consider this so-called ``core'' rate a better
indicator of underlying inflation pressures in the economy. However
the jump follows a string of five moderate rises of 0.3 percent or
0.2 percent.

<TEXT>
   Another report today showed retail sales, bolstered by a big
jump in department store sales, shot up 0.5 percent in June,
posting the first increase in five months.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration was pleased with the figures on both producer prices
and retail sales.
   ``Inflation has been steadily declining since the first of the
year, confirming our conclusion that the January price increase was
indeed temporary. This is excellent news for the economy,'' he said.
   He said the rise in retail sales in June showed that ``the
economy continues to grow but at a very moderate rate.''
   ``We're hopeful that today's news on inflation and retail sales
indicates a steadily growing economy in the month ahead,'' he said.
   The Commerce Department said sales rose to a seasonally adjusted
$147.82 billion last month, up $784 million from the May sales
level. The June increase came after a string of three consecutive
declines, something that had not happened since 1981, during the
last recession.
   Wholesale prices rose for tobacco, 3.2 percent; passenger cars,
2.3 percent; women's clothing, 0.5 percent; furniture, 0.5 percent;
jewelry, 0.9 percent; newspapers, 0.5 percent; over-the-counter
drugs, 0.8 percent, and household flatware, 2.3 percent.
   Tobacco prices are now 13.9 percent higher than a year ago.
Automobile costs rose after months of generally flat or falling
prices.
   Energy prices, which skyrocketed 13.7 percent in January because
of a severe cold snap, have declined every month since. They were
down 0.9 percent in June after dropping 1 percent in May. Fuel oil
fell 10.5 percent and gasoline was down 1.3 percent. Natural gas
costs rose 0.4 percent.
   Food prices headed lower for the third time in four months. They
dropped 0.4 percent last month after a 0.6 percent increase in May.
   Prices for both fresh fruit and eggs jumped 6.7 percent and
vegetable prices rose 2.5 percent. But, prices fell sharply for
pasta, 7.4 percent; pork, 3.4 percent; chicken, 5.8 percent, and
fish, 14.7 percent.
   The fairly stiff increase in prices excluding food and energy
could put a crimp in Federal Reserve plans to lower interest rates.
The Fed attempts to quell inflation by slowing demand with high
interest rates.
   On Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan strongly
suggested that the central bank would cut rates to counter the
dampening effects of an apparent pullback in bank lending.
   The various changes put the Producer Price Index for all
finished goods at 117.9 in June. That means a hypothetical
selection of goods that cost $100 in 1982 cost $117.90 last month,
up from $114.30 a year earlier.
   The inflation news was better at earlier stages of the
production process with prices falling 0.2 percent for intermediate
goods and 2.4 percent for crude goods. Excluding food and energy,
intermediate prices edged 0.1 percent lower and crude costs fell
0.6 percent.
   An example of the three processing stages would be bread for
finished goods, flour for intermediate and wheat for crude.

   Consumer prices have been rising faster than producer prices.
That is because half of the prices contributing to the consumer
index are for services, which are not measured directly by the
wholesale index.
   Economist Davd Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New York
government securities dealer, said economic weakness has been most
pronounced in the goods-producing sector.
   It has only recently spread to services, where a stable
unemployment rate near 5.3 percent has kept wages and, thus the
price of services, high, he said.
   For the first five months of the year, consumer prices have
risen at an annual rate of 5.8 percent, up from 4.6 percent for all
12 months of last year.
   Economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University, who
conducts his own inflation surveys, predicted that by the end of
this year, wholesale prices will have risen only 3.6 percent for
the best performance in three years.
   He forecast they would increase 3.9 percent in 1991, largely
because depressed energy prices will start rising again.
   ``Underlying inflation appears to be drifting downward, although
the speed of downward drift remains slight,'' Ratajczak wrote in a
recent newsletter.

<HEAD>Sears Expects Big Drop in Earnings Per Share</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. today said it expects
about a 32 percent drop in quarterly income per share from
continuing operations due to losses in its insurance group and
lagging earnings in the retail division.
   Sears estimated earnings of 65 cents a share from continuing
operations in this year's second quarter. That would be down from
95 cents a share, or $391.2 million, of comparable earnings a year
earlier. An estimate of total income in the quarter ended June 30
was not given.
   The expected earnings deterioration would be an even greater 41
percent if comparing this year's figure against last year's total
net income.
   The company's total profit in 1989's second quarter came to
$1.11 a share, including operations that have since been
discontinued. Sears had a second-quarter gain last year of $54.9
million from the sale of the commercial division of the Coldwell
Banker Real Estate Group.
   Edward A. Brennan, company chairman and chief executive officer,
noted that unexpectedly high catastrophe-related losses in its
Allstate Insurance Group will contribute to the shortfall. Claims
resulting from the recent fires in California contributed to
Allstate's losses.
   Profits in the Sears Merchandise Group for the second quarter
are expected to be lower than last year, Brennan said.
   ``We continue to expect a solid performance for the second half
of the year based on our outlook for continued moderate growth in
the economy,'' he said in a statement.
   The company said its second-quarter results will be released in
the week of July 23.

   Stock prices ended higher Friday as futures-led
buying underpinned an otherwise dull market.
   Some dealers were clearly surprised that the broad-based market
index was able to post any gains at all, in light of recent
indications of disappointing corporate profits.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 11.7
points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,382.2. The narrower 30-share index was
up 10 points at 1,880.1 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share

   Volume came to a moderate 399.2 million shares, compared with
460 million shares Thursday.

   Strong truck sales by the nation's Big Three
automakers pushed the sales rate for North American-made vehicles
up 1 percent in early July compared with the same period last year,
the companies said Friday.
   The increase comes on the heels of a 7.1-percent rise in
late-June sales by the Big Three. The two increases, both based on
strong truck sales, support speculation earlier this year that the
auto industry will begin to pull out of its early 1990 slump
sometime in the middle of the year.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
their combined car and truck sales averaged 33,850 a day July 1-10
this year, compared with a daily average of 33,504 last year.
   A 6.3 percent rise in truck sales offset a 2.3 percent decline
in car sales.
   Light truck sales by GM and Ford during the period rose 18.2
percent and 6.1 percent, respectively. Truck sales by Chrysler
dropped 13.9 percent.
   Chrysler, which has been struggling financially, gets a large
percentage of its vehicle profits from its minivans and Jeeps, both
classified as light trucks.
   Drawing an accurate conclusion about a trend in the industry
from two 10-day sales periods is difficult. Industry observers
prefer to see at least a month's worth of sales figures before
speculating about where the industry is heading.
   Despite the recent back-to-back increases, car and truck sales
for the Big Three are lagging behind last year.
   The companies said they sold an average 33,061 vehicles a day so
far this year, compared with 35,308 in the same period last year, a
6.4 percent decrease. Car sales were down 9.5 percent and truck
sales were off 1.3 percent.
   Chrysler was the only one of the Big Three whose combined car
and truck sales fell during early July. The nation's third-largest
automaker reported a 16.3 percent drop in vehicle sales as the
decline in truck sales combined with an 18.8 percent decrease in
car sales.
   So far this year, sales of Chrysler's domestic cars and trucks
were down 13.2 percent.
   Sales of GM vehicles in early July were running 6.7 percent
ahead of last year's pace. Car sales by the nation's largest
automaker were up 0.9 percent. GM's vehicle sales this year were
down 3.1 percent from last year.
   Ford said a 0.4 percent decline in car sales combined with its
higher light truck sales for a 2.2 percent increase in early-July
vehicle sales. So far this year, sales of Ford's North
American-made cars and trucks were down 7.3 percent from last year.

<HEAD>Dow Industrial Average Average Breaks 3000 Barrier for First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones industrial average shattered the
3,000 level for the first time in history today as the stock market
surged on a fresh wave of investor enthusiasm.
   The nation's best-known barometer of Wall Street, an index
measuring the performance of 30 big American industrial companies,
moved up 31 points from Thursday's close into 3,000-plus territory
shortly after 1:30 p.m. EST, then receded back into the 2,990-range.
   The average had risen nearly 79 points in the previous two
sessions.
   The catalyst for the latest advance came from Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who surprised the market Thursday by
saying the nation's central bank was prepared to ease credit if
necessary.
   The remark signaled an increased likelihood of lower interest
rates, which would help boost corporate profits and dim the
prospects of a recession. Bullish investors snapped up stocks on
the news.
   The Dow average was created more than a century ago when the
stock market was a fledgling operation on Wall Street and is
considered the granddaddy of all stock averages, although it no
longer necessarily reflects the behavior of stocks in general.
   It closed above 100 for the first time in January 1906. The
average broke the 1,000 barrier in November 1972 and the 2,000
barrier in January 1987. It has been flirting with the 3,000
barrier for several weeks.

<HEAD>Bond Default Rate Soars As Junk Issues Come Back To Haunt Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the bond market, this year's second quarter
turned out to be an unwelcome rerun of the first.
   The Bond Investors Association, a non-profit group that tracks
bond defaults, says 26 U.S. corporations stopped making interest
payments on bonds with a face value of $5.7 billion in the
April-June period.
   That compares with 14 issuers who defaulted on an identical
amount of bonds in the first quarter.
   ``The default rate is almost twice the historic rate,'' said
Richard Lehmann, president of the group.``We think that's basically
because the quality of the debt that was put out from '85 to '89
was vastly inferior to what was done before.''
   Lehmann places the blame on junk bonds, those high-risk,
high-yield debt securities that were the rage during the takeover
binge of the mid to late 1980s.
   The junk bond market has all but dried up due to the demise
earlier this year of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the Wall Street house
that built its short-lived fortune by selling and tirelessly
promoting junk issues.
   But the junk bonds it pumped out in the '80s are coming home to
roost _ or die, as seems to be more the case. All of the defaulted
bonds in the second quarter were junk issues, Lehmann says.
   Among them were $1.9 billion in bonds sold by Southland Corp.,
troubled owner of the 7-Eleven chain; $652 million in bonds issued
by equally troubled fellow convenience store operator Circle K
Corp.; $705 million in bonds sold by Farley Inc. for its
underfunded takeover of textile giant West Point-Pepperell; and
$637 million in Western Union Corp. bonds. All were Drexel clients.
   Also among major bond defaulters in the second quarter were
troubled savings and loans, which had issued junk as a last-ditch
attempt to stave off collapse.
   Among them were Imperial Corp. of America, a San Diego thrift
holding company with $342 million in bad bonds, and CenTrust Bank
of Miami, at $315 million, the Bond Investors Association says.
   Lehmann said he doesn't expect bond defaults to ease anytime
soon. Over the next three years he projects a total of $40 billion
in corporate bond issues will stop making payments.
   ``It should peak early next year and then start to decline. But
if the economy turns bad it could go on through next year,'' he
said last week in a telephone interview from his group's suburban
Miami headquarters.
   Had Drexel survived and the junk market not collapsed, many of
these troubled junk-financed deals from the past few years might
have been able to restructure their debt and avoid default, said
David Blitzer, chief economist for Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., a major
credit rating agency.
   Drexel's destruction left many junk-dependent clients in the
cold. ``They found themselves without a link to the market,''
Blitzer said.
   These companies also found closed doors elsewhere, he said, as
banks became wary of highly leveraged deals when the real estate
market soured and credit tightened.
   Lehmann's group said only 12 new junk bond issues totaling $1.7
billion were sold in the second quarter, compared with 93 issues
totaling $15.6 billion in 1989's second quarter.
   Recently, however, some experts have said the junk bond market
may not be all gloom and doom.
   Junk bonds have staged a rally of sorts in recent months, and by
some measures, some of the bonds have provided better returns to
investors than some investment-grade issues.
   The market received a boost last month when Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co., the big New York investment group, said it would
inject $1.7 billion into RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco company
it took private last year.
   The news ended speculation that RJR could become another
troubled junk bond giant.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Close Mostly Higher After Bullish Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crop futures prices closed mostly higher Friday
on the Chicago Board of Trade after the Agriculture Department
lowered its projections for winter wheat production and corn and
soybean stockpiles.
   But gains were limited by expectations that beneficial weather
will continue as the corn crop enters its critical pollination
phase.
   ``The market's focusing mostly on supply considerations right
now and things are looking very, very good,'' said Joel Karlin, an
analyst with Research Department Inc., a brokers' advisory service
in Chicago.
   In a supply-and-demand report released after Thursday's close,
the USDA estimated soybean stocks for Aug. 31, the end of the
1989-90 soybean marketing year, at 275 million bushels, down 20
million from its previous estimate.
   Looking ahead to next year, the government also reduced its
forecast for the 1990-91 soybean carryout by 80 million bushels to
265 million.
   In addition, the USDA trimmed its 1990-91 corn carryout estimate
by 90 million bushels to 1.13 billion and slightly reduced its 1990
winter wheat harvest projection.
   At the close, wheat futures were 3{ cents lower to 2 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $3.08 a bushel;
corn futures were { cent to 2{ cents higher with July at $2.79 a
bushel; oats were \ cent lower to 1} cents higher with July at
$1.26{ a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to 7 cents higher with
July at $6.11 a bushel.

   McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s stock moved higher
Friday as rumors and speculation about the struggling defense
contractor's future continued to swirl.
   The company denied rumors _ circulated in the financial markets
and phoned into news organizations _ that it planned to sell its
Long Beach, Calif., subsidiary, Douglas Aircraft Co., to Japanese
industrial giant Mitsubishi Group and that Chairman John F.
McDonnell would resign.
   ``McDonnell Douglas has no plans to sell Douglas Aircraft to
Mitsubishi or to anyone else,'' spokeswoman Ellen LeMond-Holman
said Friday. ``The resignation of John McDonnell, there's no truth
to that either.''
   On Thursday, the company denied rumors that it planned to file
for bankruptcy court protection.
   McDonnell Douglas stock was up $1.50 to $45.12{ a share in
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The rumors have been multiplying as McDonnell Douglas prepares
for what it calls substantial layoffs in an effort to cut expenses
by $700 million and help bolster its sagging financial performance.
   The uncertainty surrounding those layoffs and other cutbacks
have kindled the rumors, LeMond-Holman said.
   ``People are concerned for their jobs and what happens is that
anything they hear, they tell that to someone else, and it's that
feeding process, one rumor feeding off another,'' she said. ``It's
an unfortunate situation, but if we knew how to control rumors,
then I guess a lot of people would want to talk to us to find out
how to do that.''
   Howard Rubel who follows the company for the brokerage C.J.
Lawrence in New York, said the rumors were helped partly by
speculators who were betting on price movements in McDonnell
Douglas' stock.
   ``Basically, speculators are playing games with each other,''
Rubel said. ``It's sort of amusing but it's distracting, too.''
   Rubel said the rumors were ``in the realm of fantasy'' and
guessed that the company was most likely to engage in layoffs among
white collar workers in areas of the business that haven't shown
good returns.
   LeMond-Holman also denied a rumor heard by some analysts that
McDonnell Douglas had scheduled a news conference for Monday to
announce specifics concerning the layoffs and cutbacks.
   Paul Nisbet, of Prudential-Bache Securities, said employees
likely were the biggest source of rumors.
   ``It starts at the water cooler and goes all over,'' he said.
   McDonnell Douglas officials blame the layoffs and other cutbacks
on the company's weak financial performance at a time that it needs
cash to invest in new programs.
   McDonnell Douglas earned $2 million during its first quarter,
down 98 percent decline from a year earlier. The drop stemmed
mainly from huge losses at the Douglas Aircraft unit, which
primarily builds commercial jets.
   The company, the nation's biggest defense contractor, also faces
an uncertain future in the defense business as the Pentagon slashes
spending.
   While the company has not announced how many workers it plans to
lay off, analysts are predicting 10,000 to 15,000 layoffs on top of
earlier job cuts of 4,000 workers and 3,000 contracted workers at
Douglas Aircraft. McDonnell Douglas now employs about 127,000.
   The company faces serious cost problems on three military
programs, the C-17 cargo plane, the A-12 advanced tactical aircraft
and the T-45 Goshawk trainer.
   It also faces large investment costs in its not-yet-certified
MD-11 commercial jumbo jet and has experienced production problems
with its MD-80 commercial airliners.

   The stock market kept its recent rally going
today in buying that carried the Dow Jones industrial average to
the 3,000 level for the first time.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips, up 78.96 points in the
last two sessions, rose 19.56 to 2,989.36 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   The average, the oldest and best known measure of trends in
stock prices, crossed 3,000 just after 1:30 p.m., then turned back
a few moments later.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 938 up, 570 down and
477 unchanged.
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, surprised
traders in the stock and bond markets Thursday by signaling a shift
in the emphasis of the Fed's credit policy.
   He said the central bank, which has been concentrating on
fighting inflation, is now ready to ease credit conditions if
necessary.
   Interest rates fell sharply on the news. Analysts said
Greenspan's comments also went a long way toward relieving
recession worries on Wall Street.
   Enthusiasm over that prospect persisted today, apparently not
much affected by statistical reports from the government for June
showing a 0.5 percent rise in retail sales and a 0.2 percent
increase in the producer price index of finished goods.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose &rsqb; to 50&lsqb;;
Exxon &lsqb; to 49&rsqb;; General Electric 1| to 75, and McDonald's | to 37|.
   Motel 6 L.P. was the volume leader among NYSE issues, up 2~ at
22&lsqb;. Accor S.A. of France announced an agreement late Thursday to
acquire Motel 6 for $22.50 per partnership unit.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.44 to 200.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.76 at 363.99.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 183.62 million shares with an
hour to go.

<HEAD>Jury Rules on Award in Patent Infringement Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM IRWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ford Motor Co. today was ordered to pay
nearly $5.2 million to the inventor of intermittent windshield
wipers because the automaker unintentionally infringed on his
patents.
   Ford attorneys said they were pleased with the amount of the
award to Robert W. Kearns. But Kearns' attorney and son said they
were disappointed and considering an appeal.
   ``It follows the standard of the auto industry, but I don't
think that's fair. They have no interest in paying for
innovations,'' said Dennis Kearns, the inventor's oldest son.
   Robert Kearns, a former Wayne State University professor who now
lives in Gaithersburg, Md., was absent when the jury anounced its
verdict shortly after noon.
   The verdict could have wide implications because Kearns has
similar suits pending against General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp.,
Daimler-Benz, Honda, Toyota, Nissan and more than 20 other
companies. The Ford case was the first to go to trial.
   Dennis Kearns said other automakers also being sued by his
father probably would offer ``minuscule'' settlements in light of
the Ford verdict.
   Kearns, 63, originally sought $141 million, an amount that could
have been tripled had the previous damages trial determined that
Ford willfully infringed on Kearns' patents.
   Ford attorneys said a reasonable licensing agreement would have
paid the inventor $1.5 million or less.
   The jury's award, for $6.3 million, was based on what Kearns had
called Ford's profit of $6.85 on each of 20.6 million
intermittent-wiper options it sold from 1972-1988, when his main
patents were in effect.
   During a Friday afternoon hearing, U.S. District Judge Avern
Cohn ordered the award reduced to $5.16 million, which represents
what is owed to Kearns only after April 1978, when he originally
filed suit.
   The jury that decided Kearns' patents had been infringed
deadlocked on how much money he should get. The second jury heard
evidence pertaining only to the damages Kearns suffered through the
infringement.

<TEXT>
   Castle &amp; Cooke, Inc., has hired consultants to
evaluate the possibility of selling its Dole Food Co. subsidiary,
the company said.
   Castle &amp; Cooke had announced earlier that it would split Dole
and its real estate holdings into two businesses. However, those
plans were held up by a softening of the real-estate financing
market and the time needed to obtain an Internal Revenue Service
ruling on a possible spinoff.
   Castle &amp; Cooke Chairman David Murdock said Thursday that a sale
of Dole could be ``an attractive alternative to the planned
separation of our two businesses.''
   He said Castle &amp; Cooke has been contacted by several major
companies interested in acquiring Dole.
   The evaluation of a possible sale will be done by the investment
banking firm of Goldman, Sachs and Co., he said.
   Dole, founded in 1901 as a Hawaii pineapple company, has annual
sales of $2.5 billion. It is incorporated in Hawaii and based in
Los Angeles.

   Sales of North American-made cars and trucks rose
2.5 percent in early July over a year earlier, prolonging a rebound
that began in late June, the automakers said Friday.
   It was the second consecutive increase for the automakers, which
report their sales in 10-day periods. While the back-to-back
advances don't provide enough evidence to signal a trend, they
support expectations earlier this year that a sluggish early-1990
sales rate would pick up this summer.
   Despite the successive increases, the sales rate so far this
year continues to lag behind last year's pace. Car and truck sales
since Jan. 1 this year averaged 36,921 a day compared with a
38,100-a-day average last year, a 3.1 percent decline.
   Car sales for the year were down 4.3 percent and truck sales
were off 1 percent.
   Early July car sales by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. fell 2.3 percent, while sales of U.S.-made Japanese
cars and trucks rose 35.2 percent. The Big Three held 90.3 percent
of the market and the Japanese cars made up the rest.
   Together, the 10 major U.S. vehicle makers said they sold an
average of 36,499 cars and light trucks a day during the July 1-10
period this year compared with a daily rate of 35,614 vehicles last
year.
   Truck sales fueled the early July increase, rising 5.6 percent
over last year. Car sales during the period were 0.6 percent higher.
   ``We're certainly a little mystified,'' said auto analyst John
Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. of New York. ``We're surprised
because incentive costs have come down, which would have suggested
that sales would have weakened a little bit.''
   He speculated that sales may have been boosted by people who
last bought cars during the 1984-86 boom years, during which 45
million cars and trucks were sold in the United States.
   ``Those vehicles are now in excess of four years of age, and
most of them have been paid off,'' he said. ``There's no question
that there is a lot of replacement pressure.''
   Chrysler was the only one of the Big Three whose combined car
and truck sales fell during early July. The nation's third-largest
automaker reported a 16.3 percent drop in vehicle sales, as a 13.9
percent decline in truck sales combined with an 18.8 percent
decrease in car sales.
   So far this year, sales of Chrysler's domestic cars and trucks
were down 13.2 percent.
   Sales of GM vehicles in early July were 6.7 percent ahead of
last year's pace. Car sales by the nation's largest automaker were
up 0.9 percent and truck sales improved by 18.2 percent.
   GM's vehicle sales this year were down 3.1 percent from last
year.
   Ford said a 0.4 percent decline in car sales combined with a 6.1
percent increase in truck sales for a 2.2 percent increase in early
July vehicle sales. So far this year, sales of Ford's North
American-made cars and trucks were down 7.3 percent from last year.

   The stock market kept climbing today in buying
that carried the Dow Jones industrial average to the 3,000 level
for the first time.
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, surprised
traders in the stock and bond markets Thursday by signaling a shift
in the emphasis of the Fed's credit policy.
   He said the central bank, which has been concentrating on
fighting inflation, is now ready to ease credit conditions if
necessary.
   Interest rates fell sharply on the news. Analysts said
Greenspan's comments also went a long way toward relieving
recession worries on Wall Street.
   Enthusiasm over that prospect persisted today, apparently not
much affected by statistical reports from the government for June
showing a 0.5 percent rise in retail sales and a 0.2 percent
increase in the producer price index of finished goods.

<HEAD>Japan's Kubota Sued for $25 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founders of a California computer
company have filed a $25 million lawsuit claiming Kubota Ltd. of
Japan forced their firm into a merger with a financially unstable
competitor.
   The suit was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on
Thursday by Allen Michels and Matthew Sanders, founders of Ardent
Computer of Sunnyvale, Calif.
   They contend Kubota, Ardent's largest shareholder and creditor,
planned the merger in order to weaken Ardent and gain its
technology.
   ``I'm outraged,'' said Sanders. ``We want Kubota to stop trying
to drain the assets of this company.''
   According to the suit, Kubota forced Ardent into a merger with
Stellar Computer of Massachusetts last year by threatening to
withhold $50 million in promised financing. The merged company was
called Stardent Inc.
   According to the suit, Kubota's actions were intended to weaken
Stardent to where the troubled company's technology could be
acquired. In the worst case, Stardent would have gone bankrupt,
leaving Kubota as the largest creditor and shareholder.
   When the merger was completed, Kubota controlled 22 percent of
the company. Michels and Sanders serve as co-chairmen and Stellar
President John Poduska is president and chief executive officer.
   Stardent, based in Newton, Mass., issued a statement Friday
saying Michels and Sanders acted on their own, without authority
from Stardent or its board of directors. The statement said because
Stardent is not named in the suit, the company would have no
comment on the legal action.
   But the statement said Stardent and Kubota remained fully
committed to their partnership.
   ``Our relationship has been and continues to be excellent and
has worked to the advantage of both of our companies,'' Poduska
said.

<HEAD>Losses at Insurance Group Will Reduce Profit</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto CX5</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. said Friday that heavy
insurance claims after California's recent fires contributed to
losses at its Allstate Insurance Group, leading Sears to expect a
steep drop in second-quarter income.
   A weak earnings performance by the Sears Merchandise Group also
held back companywide profitability.
   Sears estimated that its profit from continuing operations will
slump 41 percent to 65 cents a share in the three months ended June
30 from $1.11 a share of net income in 1989's second quarter.
   Stock of the Chicago-based parent of the nation's largest
retailer sagged 37{ cents to $34.25 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange. Sears is scheduled to release its second-quarter results
in the week of July 23.
   Last year's second quarter included a gain of $54.9 million from
the sale of the commercial division of the Coldwell Banker Real
Estate Group. Excluding earnings from those discontinued
operations, Sears earned 95 cents a share, or $391.2 million, in
the second quarter of 1989.
   Edward A. Brennan, Sears' chairman and chief executive officer,
noted that unexpectedly high catastrophe-related losses in its
Allstate Insurance Group will contribute to the quarterly profit
deterioration. Payments on claims resulting from the fires that
ravaged parts of California took a heavy toll on Allstate.
   Profits in the Sears Merchandise Group for the second quarter
are expected to be lower than last year, Brennan said.
   ``We continue to expect a solid performance for the second half
of the year based on our outlook for continued moderate growth in
the economy,'' he said in a news release.
   The projection of losses in Sears' insurance operation came as
somewhat of a surprise because it had been expected that Allstate
would show increased earnings from last year, said Monroe H.
Greenstein, a Bear Stearns &amp; Co. analyst.
   Earnings at Allstate suffered in 1989 on account of Hurricane
Hugo, the California earthquake, floods in the South and freezes in
the Southeast and the Southwest.
   ``This year they are getting the fire around Santa Barbara,
Calif.,'' Greenstein said. ``It (catastrophe-related losses) almost
sounds Biblical in nature.''
   Greenstein said Sears' failure to implement substantial rate
increases also has hurt Allstate. He attributes the company's
reluctance to raise rates to the political climate.
   A number of states, including California, have had movements to
roll back insurance rates, which critics contend are inordinately
high.
   The reduced earnings at Sears' retailing division are due
largely to the depressed durable goods sector. Prolonged economic
weakness has made consumers conservative in buying expensive,
long-lasting merchandise, such as home appliances.
   Particularly hard hit has been Sears' home improvement business,
analysts say. For instance, sales of air conditioners, accounting
for an estimated 25 percent of the retailer's home improvement
business at this time of year, were sluggish in the spring due to
unseasonably cool weather.
   One bright spot for Sears is Brand Central, the retailer's first
attempt at selling national brands other than its own. Greenstein
said sales of appliances and consumer electronics at Brand Central
are up 7 percent to 8 percent, against a 4 percent industry-wide
decline in sales.
   Sears has been struggling to maintain its market share. Last
year it restructured and switched to an ``everyday low prices''
policy to attract customers.

   Wholesale prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in
June as declines in food and energy costs helped offset large
increases for autos and tobacco, the government said Friday.
   Meanwhile, retail sales rebounded a strong 0.5 percent, the
first gain in five months.
   The overall increase in the Labor Department's Producer Price
Index for goods one stop short of the retail level was about what
economists expected.
   However, prices for items outside the volatile food and energy
sectors jumped 0.6 percent in June, the steepest increase in a year
and about double the anticipated rise.
   Analysts consider this so-called ``core'' rate a better
indicator of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy.
   Normally, a combination of stronger consumer spending and an
upturn in core inflation would spook financial markets by
discouraging any hope that the Federal Reserve would lower interest
rates.
   This time, the market shrugged off the statistical reports. Both
stock and bond prices rose in the hours after the reports' release.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks touched 3,000 briefly
before falling back to 2,980.20, still a record high.
   Traders' optimism was buoyed by Thursday's comments from Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who suggested the central bank was
on the verge of cutting interest rates slightly to offset the
economic effects of an apparent pullback in bank lending to
businesses.
   According to traders, the central bank followed through on
Friday by pushing down the federal funds rate, the interest charged
among banks for overnight loans, from 8\ percent to 8 percent.
   The rate cut comes at an opportune time for the Bush
administration, which needs continued economic growth to bolster
Republican chances in the November congressional elections.
   Most analysts agree a rate cut would be needed to counter the
economic effects of any White House-Congress budget agreement
including higher taxes and reduced spending.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater welcomed
Greenspan's comments and said the administration was pleased with
the reports on retail sales and wholesale prices.
   ``This is excellent news for the economy,'' he said. ``Declining
inflation should continue to relieve pressure on interest rates.''
   The 0.2 percent increase in wholesale prices followed a moderate
gain of 0.3 percent in May and declines in April and March.
   Last month's increase brought wholesale inflation for the first
half of 1990 to an annual rate of 3.7 percent, compared with 4.8
percent for all of 1989.
   Prices rose 3.2 percent for tobacco and 2.3 percent for cars.
They were also up for women's clothing, furniture, jewelry,
newspapers and over-the-counter drugs.
   Tobacco prices are now 13.9 percent higher than a year ago.
Automobile costs are rebounding as dealers scale back
buyer-incentive programs.
   Economist David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass.,
forecasting firm, attributed the higher tobacco prices to chances
in federal price supports and taxes and to a crop shortfall.
   Wyss said about half of the 0.6 percent rise in core inflation
can be attributed to autos and tobacco.
   ``In general, it's neutral data,'' he said. ``Most of what we're
seeing is just a swing in food and energy prices. ... We think the
inflation rate is going to remain essentially stable.''
   Energy prices, which skyrocketed 13.7 percent in January because
of a severe cold snap, have declined every month since. They were
down 0.9 percent in June after dropping 1 percent in May.
   Fuel oil prices fell 10.5 percent. Gasoline costs were down 1.3
percent. Natural gas prices rose 0.4 percent.
   Food prices headed lower for the third time in four months. They
dropped 0.4 percent last month after a 0.6 percent increase in May.
Prices rose for fresh fruit and vegetables, eggs and dairy
products, but fell sharply for pasta, pork, chicken and fish.
   The various changes put the Producer Price Index for all
finished goods at 117.9 in June. That means a hypothetical
selection of goods that cost $100 in 1982 would have cost $117.90
last month, up from $114.30 a year earlier.
   At earlier stages of the production process, prices fell 0.2
percent for intermediate goods and 2.4 percent for crude goods.
Excluding food and energy, intermediate-goods prices edged 0.1
percent lower and crude-goods costs fell 0.6 percent.
   An example of the three processing stages would be bread for
finished goods, flour for intermediate and wheat for crude.
   In Friday's other report, the Commerce Department said retail
sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $147.82 billion last month, up
$784 million from the May sales level. The June increase came after
a string of three consecutive declines, something that had not
happened since 1981, during the last recession. Sales had been flat
in February.

<HEAD>Trustee: Eastern Losses To Shrink; Airline May Show 1991 Operating
Profit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines expects to cut its losses
considerably during 1990, but will still show a shortfall of more
than $330 million, trustee Martin Shugrue said Friday.
   Shugrue told a news conference the airline's performance
continues to improve and Eastern is seeing an increase in ridership
that should help the carrier show an operating profit in 1991.
   Eastern lost $852.3 million last year. Shugrue said the company
would suffer a substantial loss tis year, but it would be much
lower than in 1989.
   Asked if the deficit would be more than $330 million, Shugrue
replied that it would.
   He said he hoped the airline could emerge from bankruptcy court
protection by the end of this year, but no target date has been set
for Eastern to file a plan of reorganization with the court.
   Shugrue was appointed in April by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton
Lifland to take control of the airline from Frank Lorenzo, chairman
of Eastern's parent Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., the former
Texas Air Corp.
   The trustee said the airline would announce during the summer a
marketing plan aimed at grabbing a greater share of the crucial
business travel market and ultimately improving Eastern's
profitability.
   ``We expect to be in a good position to be capitalizing on the
business frequent flyer'' during the fall, Shugrue said.
   Shugrue spoke with reporters after meeting with Eastern's
unsecured creditors committee and presenting to them the company's
latest business plan.
   The trustee spoke in broad generalities about the plan and
offered few numbers. He said it presented a bleaker picture of the
airline's finances for the next few months, but a healthier outlook
for 1991.
   He said the creditors reacted positively to the plan, were
expected to continue funding the airline's short-term losses and
were not planning to call for a liquidation of the company.
   The trustee said Eastern was still holding ``substantial talks''
with Northwest Airlines about a possible purchase of the carrier.
Shugrue said he had met with Northwest Chairman Alfred Checchi, and
``we are setting up follow-on meetings to see if there is an
opportunity for Northwest and Eastern to do something together.''
   Other parties have expressed interest in Eastern, but the
carrier is not currently holding substantive negotiations with
anyone other than Northwest, Shugrue said.
   At times Shugrue boomed the airline's accomplishments as he does
in Eastern television commercials. The carrier's current ad
campaign shows Shugrue giving Eastern employees a pep talk and
confidently predicting a turnaround.
   Shugrue boasted several times of the airline's on-time
performance, said service was improving and that passengers
increasingly are satisfied.
   But at other times, his frustration was apparent, especially as
he discussed Eastern's labor problems.
   Shugrue said the airline continues to negotiate with its pilots
union, which is threatening a strike if their contract dispute is
not resolved. Eastern and the pilots are in a 30-day cooling off
period after having declared their contract dispute at an impasse.
   ``It's hard for me to understand how pilots who are not working
can go on strike,'' Shugrue said. Most of Eastern's pilots, who
struck in March 1989 in sympathy with the airline's Machinists
union but later called off their walkout, have not been recalled to
work.
   Eastern hired replacements for the pilots and machinists and
flight attendants who also walked out.
   Eastern filed for bankruptcy reorganization after the walkouts
began. Since then, the company has sold some of its routes,
including its Northeastern shuttle, and has pared away other assets
in order to reposition itself as a smaller carrier.

<HEAD>American Pilots Replace Negotiators in 10-Month-Long Contract
Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The union representing American
Airlines' 8,500 pilots has replaced its contract negotiators,
signalling a possible hardening of positions as the two sides work
for a new agreement.
   The Allied Pilots Association suspended talks with the airline
last month while its board of directors convened to discuss
dissatisfaction with the pace of the 10-month-old negotiations.
   A large faction of pilots reportedly was unhappy with the
failure of the negotiating team to win an agreement to abandon, or
reduce the impact of, the so-called ``B-scale'' pay rate for less
senior pilots.
   At a board meeting in Chicago Wednesday and Thursday, the
five-member negotiating team was replaced and expanded to six
members, according to a message on the union's information line.
   Union officials remained in Chicago Friday and did not return
telephone calls to The Associated Press seeking comment.
   The replacement is expected to lengthen the negotiations, which
have been conducted with a federal mediator since February.
   ``We will negotiate with whomever the union authorizes us to
negotiate with,'' said Al Becker, spokesman for Fort Worth-based
American. ``The real issue is to get back to the negotiating table
as quickly as possible so that we can work in the spirit of
compromise toward reaching a new agreement.''
   The contract became eligible for amendments on Dec. 31, although
negotiations on a new pact began in October. After a stalemate in
January, federal mediator Harry Bickford was brought in and
meetings were held almost daily beginning in February until last
month's recess.
   Under the National Railway Act, the contract does not expire,
and a strike cannot be called unless the mediator declares talks to
be at an impasse and a 30-day ``cooling off'' period has elapsed.
   The old contract provides for a ``B-scale'' wage rate for pilots
hired after 1983, amounting to about half the starting pay for
pilots already on the payroll.
   With about half of the pilots now covered by the lower wage
rates, there is growing pressure to bring them closer to their
colleagues at American and elsewhere.
   American Chairman Bob Crandall has warned that a huge increase
for pilots would threaten the airline's aggressive expansion
program. He argues that the airline's growth provides opportunities
for a more rapid rise to a captain's rank and pay.
   Also at issue is American's insistence the pilots contribute
more to their health care program.

   The stock market forged ahead again Friday in
buying that carried the Dow Jones industrial average briefly to the
3,000 level for the first time.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed at 2,980.20, for
a net gain of 10.40 points on the day and a 75.25-point rise for
the week.
   The average, the oldest and best known measure of trends in
stock prices, crossed 3,000 just after 1:30 p.m., then turned back
a few moments later.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
954 up, 619 down and 460 unchanged.
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, surprised
traders in the stock and bond markets Thursday by signaling a shift
in the emphasis of the Fed's credit policy.
   He said the central bank, which has been concentrating on
fighting inflation, is now ready to ease credit conditions if
necessary.
   Interest rates fell sharply on the news. Analysts said
Greenspan's comments also went a long way toward relieving
recession worries on Wall Street.
   Enthusiasm over that prospect persisted Friday, apparently not
much affected by statistical reports from the government for June
showing a 0.5 percent rise in retail sales and a 0.2 percent
increase in the producer price index of finished goods.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose 1 to 121; General Electric 1{ to 74~; Merck | to 88~,
and Eli Lilly 1 to 88{.
   Motel 6 L.P. was one of the volume leaders among NYSE issues, up
2} at 22. Accor S.A. of France announced an agreement late Thursday
to acquire Motel 6 for $22.50 per partnership unit.
   Castle &amp; Cooke jumped 6 to 36{. The company said it has received
inquiries from several parties interested in buying its Dole
operations.
   Computer Associates International dropped &rsqb; to 9~ on top of a
6\-point slide Thursday, when the company said it would probably
show declines in both revenues and earnings for the second quarter.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 215.60 million
shares, against 211.51 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 259.30 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $17.45 billion, or
0.50 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.01 to 200.33.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index gained 2.01 to 435.38, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.87 at 367.31.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.27 to 468.44. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 363.99, up 1.76.

<HEAD>Execs Say Motel 6 Buyers Plan to Double Expansion Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French company paying $1.3 billion for Motel
6 plans to accelerate the budget lodging chain's expansion rate and
open the brand's first outlets in Canada and Mexico, executives
said Friday.
   Lodging industry analysts, meanwhile, said the price that Accor
SA of Paris agreed to pay for the chain reflects both the appealing
growth prospects for economy lodging and Accor's view of the best
path into the U.S. market.
   Burland East, an analyst for the investment firm Bateman Eichler
Hill Richards &amp; Co., said the economy segment of the lodging market
has been growing three to four times as fast as the industry
overall.
   He said Accor, which already owns 850 hotels in 60 countries, is
getting an experienced management team and a popular brand name
along with the 554 Motel 6 properties in the United States.
   ``They are getting a lot more than they could build on their
own,'' he said.
   Accor announced Thursday that it had agreed to pay $22.50 per
unit for the more than 55 million Motel 6 LP partnership units. It
said its tender offer would begin no later than Wednesday and that
it had the financing for the deal.
   The investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which owns
more than 50 percent of the partnerhip's equity, said it would
tender its stake under terms of the deal. The firm expects its
partners will realize a healthy 38 percent annualized profit on
their initial investment in Motel 6 in 1985.
   The Kohlberg Kravis group bought Motel 6 for $880 million,
including $125 million in equity and $756 million in debt, and sold
a minority interest to the public in 1986.
   Accor said it intended to keep the current management team that
had overseen the $700 million invested in the motel chain over the
past five years.
   Motel 6 used the money to add 180 motels to the chain, install
telephones and color televisions in all 63,765 rooms, start a
national reservation system and launch a folksy advertising
campaign that extolled its low prices and clean rooms and poked fun
at the amenities more expensive motels provide.
   ``You can't get a hot facial mudpack at Motel 6 like you can at
those fancy joints,'' humorist Tom Bodett said in one Motel 6 radio
ad.
   The strategy enabled Motel 6 to attract more business travelers
and boost its occupancy rate to about 77 percent this year compared
with an industry average of about 63 percent.
   But guests still pay less than at many other hotels _ currently
an average of about $27 a night.
   Georges LeMener, director of the office of chairman for Accor,
said in an interview Friday that his company has no plans to change
Motel 6's approach.
   He said Accor plans to invest about $225 million a year in each
of the next five years to expand the chain.
   Motel 6 Chief Executive Joseph McCarthy said the chain has been
adding about 35 to 40 motels a year, but said that with Accor's
backing the expansion program will be twice as rapid.
   ``We will try to get 75 a year, and we will begin expanding into
Mexico and Canada as well,'' he said. Motel 6 has no motels in
either country now.
   McCarthy said the chain would also stick with its approach of
owning and operating all of its properties, unlike some other
chains that award franchises to independent operators.
   ``When you are in the economy business, all you have to sell is
price and consistency of product,'' McCarthy said. ``You can't do
that unless you own and operate the product.''

<HEAD>Arizona Insurance Department Investigating Fail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arizona Department of Insurance is
investigating James Fail for failing to disclose that he had been
barred from working in the insurance business in Alabama for
alleged securities fraud.
   Fail, who also has been accused of misleading regulators in
Texas and Florida, already is the subject of a U.S. Senate panel
probe related to his purchase of 15 failed Texas savings and loans.
   He was indicted in Alabama in 1976 for securities fraud, but
those charges were dropped after he signed an order barring him
from conducting future business in that state.
   Arizona insurance investigators said Thursday that they are
attempting to determine why Fail denied having been subjected to
any court order regarding violation of securities in his annual
disclosure certificate filed in 1988.
   However, Arizona insurance officials apparently were aware of
his background when Fail acquired Farm &amp; Home Insurance Co. in
1979. Records show that the indictment and order were revealed
during a hearing on the acquisition.
   False information provided to the department can result in the
revocation of an operating license, officials said.
   Fail reportedly was in Europe this week and could not be reached
for comment. His Washington attorney, Stanley Brand, issued a
statement earlier this week saying Fail has complied with federal
regulations.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, the head of a Senate Judiciary
subcommittee, has launched an investigation to determine whether
federal regulators adequately probed Fail's background before they
allowed him to take over the failed Texas savings and loans.
   Metzenbaum contends Fail should be disqualified from a 1988
agreement with the government because of his background.
   Fail was allowed to buy the thrifts with only $1,000 of his own
money and $70 million in loans. In return, he was promised $1.85
billion in federal aid.
   Arizona insurance officials suspended Farm &amp; Home's license last
week, and the company was placed under the department's
supervision. The company has more than 125,000 life insurance
policies nationwide, 6,700 of them in Arizona, according to
insurance officials.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Surge But Some Advise Caution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices rallied strongly Friday on New York's
Commodity Exchange but some analysts wondered whether the market
will sustain the gains, which were prompted in part by a decline in
interest rates.
   On other commodity markets, silver also rose; petroleum futures
were mixed; grains and soybeans advanced; and livestock and meat
futures rose.
   Gold futures settled $6.20 to $6.70 higher in New York with the
contract for delivery in August at $365.70 a troy ounce, its
highest settlement price since May 31.
   Silver futures ended 1.7 cents to 1.8 cents higher with July at
$4.908 a troy ounce.
   The rally in gold extended a $3.90 gain posted Thursday after
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated the Fed,
which has been concentrating on fighting inflation, is now ready to
ease credit conditions if necessary.
   Interest rates fell sharply on the news and gold, which is
considered an investment hedge against inflation, rose.
   Analysts agreed that lower rates could create a friendlier
atmosphere for gold.
   Craig Sloane, a metals analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co., said gold's upward reversal on Thursday following the
Greenspan comments could be construed as a sign that the market has
ended its recent decline.
   But Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with PaineWebber
Inc., said other conditions did not appear right for gold to
sustain the rally.
   Sharp gains in the stock market, such as occurred on Thursday
and Friday, are typically bearish for gold, he said.
   Silver's relatively weak gains on Friday also contradicted
notions of a major bull move beginning in the precious metals, he
said.
   Savaiko said the two-day runup in gold prices might simply have
represented book-squaring ahead of Friday's expiration of the
August gold options contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
bottom-picking by investors when gold fell to near $350 an ounce on
Thursday.
   ``We had a lot of bargain hunting at those lower levels,'' he
said. ``The question is, are they willing to hold it here at these
levels?''
   Crude oil futures ended mixed in a volatile session dominated by
bullish news of OPEC unity on measures to contain crude production
and boost prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents lower to 17
cents higher with August at $18.36 a barrel; heating oil was .78
cent to 1.85 cents higher with August at 54.21 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .43 cent to 1.38 cents higher with August at
61.95 cents a pound.
   Crop futures prices ended higher on the Chicago Board of Trade
following an Agriculture Department report in which the agency
lowered its projections for winter wheat production and corn and
soybean stockpiles.
   But gains were limited by expectations that beneficial weather
will continue as the corn crop enters its critical pollination
phase.
   The National Weather Service predicts more good growing weather
on the way. In reports released after the close, the agency
predicted normal to above-normal temperatures and precipitation in
the Midwest for the period July 19-23, and normal temperatures and
rainfall for the next 30 days.
   Wheat futures settled 4 cents lower to 2 cents higher with July
at $3.07 a bushel; corn futures were { cent to 2{ cents higher with
July at $2.79 a bushel; oats were \ cent to } cent higher with July
at $1.25{ a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents lower to 3 cents higher
with July at $6.10\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in
line with stronger cash markets. Pre-weekend position-squaring
lifted hog futures.
   Live cattle were .35 cent to .67 cent higher with August at
75.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to 1.15 cents
higher with August at 87.42 cents a pound; live hogs were .40 cent
to 1 cent higher with July at 61.27 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.12 cents lower to .90 cent higher with July at 49.35
cents a pound.

   Bond prices posted another broad advance Friday
as the Federal Reserve took steps that traders viewed as evidence
the central bank was adopting a more generous credit policy.
   A day after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted that
the Fed was poised to relax credit conditions because loans were
becoming harder to get, the central bank injected reserves into the
banking system at midday.
   The move led to a quarter-point decline in a key lending rate.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond climbed 17-32 point, or
about $5.25 per $1,000 face amount, after rising $7.50 on Thursday.
   Its yield, which falls when prices rise, dropped to 8.45 percent
from 8.49 percent late Thursday.
   Bond prices moved higher from the start of trading on
expectations that interest rates would be moving lower in the wake
of Greenspan's comments Thursday to the Senate Banking Committee.
   Prices moved even higher in late morning trading when the Fed
added reserves to the banking system by arranging short-term
purchases of securities.
   With more funds available to banks, the federal funds rate,
which is the interest that banks charge each other for short-term
loans, slipped to 8 percent from 8\ percent late Thursday. The
funds rate had fluctuated near 8\ percent for months.
   ``The Fed eased,'' said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, who heads a
consulting firm that bears her name. ``They are putting Greenspan's
`may' and `might' into action.''
   The federal funds rate is often seen as an indicator of which
way other lending rates are headed.
   But Mrs. Ramirez said she does not expect a quick decline in
consumer lending rates to follow the move in the federal funds rate
because many banks are facing profit pressures due to shaky real
estate and Third World loans.
   Meanwhile, government reports on wholesale inflation and retail
sales went virtually ignored by bond traders.
   The Commerce Department said declining food and energy prices
helped hold the Producer Price Index to a modest 0.2 percent in
June. However, costs of other items were up more sharply than in
recent months.
   A separate report showed retail sales rose 0.5 percent in June,
snapping a string of five straight monthly declines.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose 7-32 point, intermediate maturities gained between
\ point and 13-32 point and long-term issues advanced as much as
17-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information
service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.10 to 1,161.96.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 7-32 point to 92&rsqb;. The average yield to
maturity slipped to 7.42 percent from 7.44 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.83 percent as the
discount dropped 8 basis points to 7.59 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell to 7.89 percent as the discount declined 7
basis points to 7.50 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.89
percent as the discount fell 7 basis points to 7.36 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose domestically Friday in volatile,
heavy trading after falling in Europe.
   Meanwhile, gold prices surged, continuing a climb that began
Thursday after the value of the dollar fell.
   Gold typically rises when the dollar falls because it becomes a
more attractive investment alternative and becomse relatively
cheaper to investors using foreign currencies.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
closed at $364.40, up $6.30 an ounce. Republic National Bank later
quoted a bid of $364.00 an ounce for gold, up $6.30 from Thursday.
   Warren Myers, a vice president at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. who
follows the gold market, said trading was influenced Friday by ``a
carryover effect from yesterday.''
   On Thursday, gold rose sharply after the dollar fell on comments
by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that the Fed might
consider easing interest rates.
   Lower rates reduce the returns on dollar-denominated
investments, thus sending investors to other currencies.
   Other traders said gold prices were boosted Friday by the
expiration of the August contract on gold options on the New York
Comex.
   Gold rose even more sharply overseas, partly due to Greenspan's
comments and in part because of at least two waves of Middle East
buying, traders said.
   Gold jumped to a late bid of $364.55 a troy ounce in London from
$351.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold traded at $364.20 per ounce,
up from $351.60 late Thursday.
   Earlier, gold rose $5.56 an ounce to close at $359.94 in Hong
Kong.
   The dollar, meanwhile, changed direction from Thursday, rising
in domestic trading in a seesaw session.
   Traders said the dollar rose after the government reported that
wholesale prices climbed a modest 0.2 percent in June, indicating
low inflation.
   But the dollar fell after the Federal Reserve arranged weekend
repurchase agreements, the agency's method for adding funds to the
banking system. That has the effect of lowering interest rates, and
some traders interpreted it as a a follow-through to Greenspan's
remarks.
   The federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other on
overnight loans, moved lower, a negative for the dollar.
   But the dollar soon climbed, partly because European traders
were buying dollars to shore up their positions as the markets
there closed, said Francoise Soares-Kemp, a vice president in the
foreign exchange department of Credit Suisse in New York.
   The dollar also was boosted by traders who believed the currency
had reached its floor and were buying dollars to cover short
trading positions, traders said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to its lowest level since Feb. 22,
closing at 147.42 yen, down 1.48 yen from Thursday. Later in
London, the dollar firmed to 147.50 yen. In New York, one dollar
bought 148.15 yen, up from 147.40 yen late Thursday.
   In London, the British pound traded at $1.8020, up from $1.7995
late Thursday. But in New York, a pound cost $1.8005, cheaper than
$1.8130 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late quotes, included: 1.6510 German marks, up from 1.6355; 1.4025
Swiss francs, up from 1.3895; 5.5390 French francs, up from 5.4910;
1,208.75 Italian lire, up from 1,198.75; and 1.1579 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.15675.
   Other dollar rates in Europe compared with late rates Thursday
included: 1.6430 West German marks, down from 1.6525; 1.3925 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4020; 5.5115 French francs, down from 5.5460;
1.8520 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8625; 1,203.25 Italian lire,
down from 1,211.00, and 1.1576 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1580.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $4.93 a troy
ounce, up from $4.86 late Thursday.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery finished at
$4.908 a troy ounce, up from Thursday's $4.890.

   Iberia Airlines will return to the
Sabre computer reservations systems Monday under an agreement
announced Friday between the Spanish carrier and American Airlines
Inc.
   Iberia, the national airline of Spain, had withdrawn from
American's Sabre system June 11 in a dispute over the way its
flights were listed in the computer.
   The agreement, reached after a meeting between the two carriers
last week, will modify the way U.S. travel agents view schedules to
improve international carriers' chances of showing up on Sabre's
computer screens.
   The two carriers also agreed to abide by the code of conduct of
Common Market countries, which requires that prices charged be
reasonably related to cost.
   The agreement is subject to approval by the U.S. Department of
Transportation.
   Sabre, which enables travel agents and others to make
reservations on and sell tickets on all airlines, is the nation's
largest computer reservation system.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged
Friday that unknown parties engaged in insider trading in Contel
Corp. securities in the days before the telephone company agreed to
a $6 billion takeover by GTE Corp.
   The SEC, in a federal lawsuit filed in New York, claimed that
``individuals or entities whose identities are as yet unknown to
the commission'' bought Contel common stock or call options
contracts while in possession of confidential corporate information.
   According to the SEC, the unidentified defendants stood to make
more than $1 million in alleged illegal profits on investments of
$205,125.
   The SEC obtained court orders freezing U.S. brokerage accounts
used to conduct the alleged illegal trading and preventing the
destruction or alteration of documents.
   Joseph Goldstein, associate director of the SEC's Enforcement
Division, said it was not unusual for the agency to act against
alleged wrongdoers without knowing their identity.
   ``We know what the accounts are but we don't know who the
persons are. What we don't know is who the ultimate customer is,''
he said.
   Goldstein declined to say how the SEC became aware of the
alleged illegal activity. Court papers said the defendants bought
Contel call options on the American Stock Exchange and Contel
common stock on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Tony Hamilton, a GTE spokesman in Stamford, Conn., said the
company was aware of the investigation and intended to cooperate
fully.
   On Thursday, Atlanta-based Contel, the nation's third-largest
independent telephone company, said it would accept the takeover
offer by No. 1 GTE Corp.
   GTE is to exchange 1.27 shares of its common stock for each of
Contel's 159 million shares. That values Contel stock at about
$37.47 a share based on Friday's closing GTE price of $29.50 a
share.
   Contel shares jumped $7.25 to close at $35.25 a share Thursday
following news of the buyout agreement.
   According to the SEC complaint, on Tuesday and Wednesday the
unidentified defendants bought or caused the purchase of Contel
securities through New York accounts maintained by financial
institutions in Switzerland and Germany.
   The buyout negotiations were intended to be confidential,
although numerous people from both companies, their investment
bankers and attorneys firms were privy to the discussions.
   ``Contel and GTE closely monitored the volume of trading in
Contel and GTE securities to determine whether possible leaks were
occurring,'' the SEC said, although it did not indicate whether the
companies tipped it off to the suspicious trading.
   The suit said such trading took place in both Contel common
stock and call options.
   Call options _ which are the right to buy 100 shares of a stock
at a set price before a certain date _ are used by investors
speculating that a stock's price is about to rise sharply.
   The lawsuit said trading in Contel call options on the American
Stock Exchange for for July 5, 6, and 9 was 329 contracts. On July
10 and 11 _ the two days before the deal was announced _ 6,546
contracts were traded.
   The lawsuit said the defendants accounted for about 3,292 of the
contracts purchased on July 10 and 11.
   The trading of Contel common stock involved 10,000 shares bought
on July 11 by a German bank. The lawsuit said the buying price was
not known.
   The merger is subject to the approval of both companies'
stockholders, and by regulatory agencies.
   It would result in the country's second-largest cellular phone
system operator after McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., and the
nation's largest local-exchange telephone company.

<HEAD>P&amp;G Closing 83-Year-Old Plant in Neighborhood Named for Ivory Soap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Thursday it was
closing an 83-year-old plant on Staten Island in a neighborhood
that takes its name from the company's famed Ivory soap.
   P&amp;G said operations from the plant, which employs about 425
people in the island's Port Ivory section, would be relocated to
other factories around the country. The plant is to be shut down
over the next 19 months.
   In addition to Ivory soap, the Port Ivory factory makes Coast
soap bars, Bold and Solo liquid laundry detergent, Mr. Clean and
Top Job surface cleaners, and Citrus Hill orange juice.
   P&amp;G spokeswoman Louise Hughes said employment at the factory,
which was built in 1907, peaked around 1980 with 1,400 workers.
   Mrs. Hughes said the decision to close the factory was made late
last week after the company decided it would be more economical to
consolidate production at other plants.
   `We wanted to consolidate that manufacturing to fewer
locations,'' she said. ``It made more economic sense to phase out
manufacturing at Port Ivory than it did at other locations.''
   The company so far has decided to move the Citrus Hill
production to its Chicopee, Mass., plant and the Mr. Clean and Top
Job production to its St. Louis plant, she said. Some employees
will be transferred to other plants starting this fall.
   A Procter &amp; Gamble plant in Avenel, N.J., that now employs 75
people making perfume for company products will be expanded and
some of the Staten Island workers may wind up there, officials said.
   ``This is just another example of how the high cost of doing
business in this city and state is driving industry away,'' Staten
Island Borough President Guy Molinari said in a statement.
   Staten Island is part of New York City. The Port Ivory plant was
one of the first opened by Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble.

   The Dow Jones industrial average shattered the
3,000 level for the first time but settled below that lofty mark.
   Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange whooped when
the nation's best-known stock barometer, which has flirted with
3,000 for nearly two months, finally crossed that level on Friday
and stayed there for about six minutes before sellers pushed it
lower.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed at 2,980.20, for
a net gain of 10.40 points on the day and a 75.25-point rise for
the week.

   Wholesale prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in
June as declines in food and energy costs helped offset large
increases for autos and tobacco, the government said.
   The overall increase in the Labor Department's Producer Price
Index for goods one stop short of the retail level was about what
economists expected.
   In a separate report on Friday, the government also said retail
sales rebounded a strong 0.5 percent, the first gain in five months.

   Sales of North American-made cars and trucks rose

   Friday's reports marked the second consecutive increase for the
automakers, which report their sales in 10-day periods. The
back-to-back advances support expectations earlier this year that a
sluggish early-1990 sales rate would pick up this summer.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. said heavy insurance
claims after California's recent fires contributed to losses at its
Allstate Insurance Group, leading Sears to expect a steep drop in
second-quarter income.
   A weak earnings performance by the Sears Merchandise Group also
held back companywide profitability.
   Sears estimated Friday that its profit from continuing
operations will slump 41 percent to 65 cents a share in the three
months ended June 30 from $1.11 a share of net income in 1989's

   Eastern Airlines expects to cut losses
considerably during 1990, but will still show a shortfall of more
than $330 million, trustee Martin Shugrue said.
   Shugrue told a news conference Friday the airline's performance
continues to improve and Eastern is seeing an increase in ridership
that should help the carrier show an operating profit in 1991.
   Eastern lost $852.3 million last year. Shugrue said the company
would suffer a substantial loss tis year, but it would be much
lower than in 1989.
