   A suspect in the killing of five
college students said he knew who killed two victims and gave a
name police believe is one of his multiple personalities, a
newspaper reported Friday.
   Edward Lewis Humphrey, 18, has been held in the Brevard County
Jail on charges of assaulting his grandmother but has not been
charged in any of the Gainesville killings.
   The Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville, citing unidentified
sources, said in its early Saturday editions that, after he was
arrested Aug. 30, he talked to officers about the killings of the
first two victims _ Christina Powell, 17, and Sonja Larson, 18.
They were found Aug. 26 in their Gainesville apartment.
   He said he knew who killed the two and blamed one of the
personalities he has appeared to exhibit, the Times-Union reported.
   The newspaper did not print the name, but during a bond hearing
Thursday, a jail guard had testified that Humphrey referred to
himself as ``John.''
   Humphrey's lawyer, public defender J. R. Russo, told The
Associated Press he was unaware of any such statements by his
client.
   ``It's news to me,'' he said.
   He added that he had been concerned all along about Humphrey's
initial interrogation, which took place with no lawyer present.
   So far, authorities have refused to discuss publicly what
Humphrey said in any statement.
   Meanwhile, police said Friday that they have gathered
``promising'' evidence, but cautioned that they don't expect any
immediate results.
   Police would provide no details about what information was
gathered in searches of Humphrey's Gainesville apartment, his car
and his grandmother's home in Indialantic, a coastal city about 180
miles southeast of Gainesville.
   ``We did not leave empty-handed,'' Lt. Sadie Darnell said, but
added that lab tests will take time to tell if they have anything
useful as evidence.
   Besides the searches of the homes and car, agents obtained a
personal search warrant for Humphrey that could yield evidence on
bodily fluids, fingerprints and hair.
   Agents spent Thursday searching Humphrey's apartment and the
13-room, two-story house in Indialantic. Humphrey's car was loaded
onto a flatbed car carrier and taken to a state crime lab in
Jacksonville where it was to be searched.
   ``Evidence gathered at both scenes and in Brevard County is
promising,'' Ms. Darnell said.
   Despite the intense interest in Humphrey, police continue to say
he is one of eight suspects and no arrests are imminent. Police
canceled weekend news briefings, saying no significant developments
are expected.
   ``We are not going to identify anyone as a No. 1 suspect,'' Ms.
Darnell said, adding police had received 3,670 leads so far.
   New charges of aggravated assault have been filed against
Humphrey as a result of a confrontation the night before the first
two bodies were discovered.
   Greg Herskowitz and Rob Lipvak, two 18-year-old Pi Lambda Phi
pledges, claim Humphrey threatened them with a knife at the
fraternity house Aug. 25.
   Humphrey is being held on $1 million bond in an attack on his
79-year-old grandmother. He also faces charges in Indian River
County of armed burglary and attempted sexual battery two years ago.
   Police disclosed for the first time Friday that Manuel Taboada,
the only man killed by the serial slayer, was asleep in bed when he
was slain.
   ``He was apparently surprised by his attacker,'' Ms. Darnell
said.
   Besides Larson and Powell, the other victims were Christa Hoyt,
19, and Taboada's roommate Tracy Paules, 23.
   Dr. Michael West, who spent 1{ days studying the three murder
scenes, said he believes the killer was wearing gloves because he
left virtually no trace of himself.
   ``I thought I'd seen everything,'' he said in a taping of the
``Donahue'' show that was broadcast live in Gainesville Friday.
``When the full story is released, you'll be shocked and amazed.''
   The show was almost knocked off the air when a man riding a
bicycle stopped and cut cables to five of six cameras, police said.
The man was not caught.

   A gunman who held police at bay for 5{ hours
Friday ended the standoff by shooting himself in the head and
falling from atop a 16-story building in one of the city's busiest
neighborhoods, authorities said.
   Paul A. Fisher, 30, of Pittsburgh was propelled forward off an
apartment building's roof by a single shot from a handgun about
5:10 p.m., said Police Chief Mayer DeRoy. He was pronounced dead at
the scene.
   No one on the ground was injured.
   ``He said he was going to jump since we wouldn't assassinate
him,'' DeRoy said.
   Fisher, who had a history of mental illness and problems at
home, apparently was trying to draw attention to himself on the
apartment building's roof, DeRoy said.
   He wore a bright orange hat and blue short-sleeved shirt, and
had 50 rounds of ammunition in a duffel bag, DeRoy said.
   About noon, Fisher fired one shot from a .22-caliber rifle at an
unmarked police car and 11 other rifle shots into the air, police
said.
   Two Roman Catholic schools were evacuated, and a four- to
five-block area was blocked off to traffic.
   Police believed they were making progress 15 minutes before
Fisher killed himself because he turned over the rifle to police
negotiators.
   Fisher climbed a drainpipe to get to the roof's tallest parapet
and smoked a cigarette on a ledge, DeRoy said.
   ``He then put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger,'' the
chief said. ``I told him we weren't interested in prosecuting him
criminally. We were only interested in getting him help.''
   Fisher killed himself before hundreds of onlookers and several
TV crews. Local Pittsburgh newscasts did not air the videotape,
while national CNN Headline News did.
   He told police he was up on the roof half an hour with weapons
and no one was paying attention to him, so he fired at the unmarked
police car with the .22-caliber rifle.
   DeRoy said the man threw scrap paper over the side of the
building to see how long it took to fall to the ground.
   Fisher fired the first shot at an unmarked police car shortly
before noon, said Assistant Police Chief Donald Aubrecht. Over the
next several hours, he fired several other rounds into the air and
occasionally pointed the rifle at the ground without shooting.
   Police sharpshooters took up positions on rooftops near the
16-story Moorehead Towers, said public safety spokeswoman Margaret
Philbin. The building houses the elderly and handicapped in the
city's Oakland section.
   Four police officers tried to talk with the sniper from a
stairway on the outside of the building, Ms. Philbin said.
   ``All he wants is a Coke and cigarettes. They threw him a
bunch,'' she said.
   More than 50 police officers were at the scene and cordoned off
an area of about four or five blocks around the building, snarling
traffic in the heavily populated area near the University of
Pittsburgh.
   Students at two Roman Catholic schools near the apartments were
led out the schools' back doors to safety and continued classes at
another school, also in Oakland.

<HEAD>Swiss Financier Outlines Iran-Contra Profits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former CIA agent earned at least $843,000 for
supplying weapons during the Iran-Contra affair, according to
prosecution evidence presented Friday.
   The government is trying to prove that Thomas G. Clines, 62, of
Middleburg, Va., failed to report all of his Iran-Contra earnings
on his tax returns. Clines also is charged with failing to report
his overseas financial accounts to the Internal Revenue Service.
   Clines reported gross earnings of $265,000 for the tax year 1985
and $402,513 for 1986, according to a four-count indictment
returned here in February.
   According to documents presented in court, Clines received
$423,534 for helping procure arms for the Contra rebels in 1985. He
earned $420,238 in 1986, according to testimony.
   When the trial in U.S. District Court resumes Monday, the
government will call witnesses expected to testify about additional
profits Clines and the other Iran-Contra figures earned.
   During six hours of testimony, Swiss financier Willard I. Zucker
identified dozens of financial documents and memos outlining how
the arms deal profits were split among retired Maj. Gen. Richard
Secord, Iranian-born businessman Albert Hakim and Clines.
   Zucker, who works at a Geneva-based financial services company
that handled money for the arms deals, testified that Hakim and
Secord asked the firm to alter some records.
   ``Cash would come into the accounts. It was never explained to
us what that cash was used for or where it was from,'' Zucker said.
``When cash was going out, no one explained to us why we were
making that payment. We didn't receive invoices.
   ``We were told by our clients that this was a White House covert
operation. We were not encouraged to ask questions. We were
supposed to keep track of the money. We did the best we could,'' he
said.
   Zucker testified that Hakim asked the company to revise account
statements, but he did not know when the changes were made or what
they included.
   He said financial documents presented at Clines' trial were not
among those altered.
   The Iran-Contra affair was disclosed to the public in November
1986. Congressional investigators used Hakim's financial records to
trace the paper trail of the scheme, during profits from arms sales
to Iran were diverted to rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan
government, despite a congressional ban on such funding.
   Secord testified Wednesday that he believed some of the ledgers
recording the Iran-Contra arms transactions were falsified but said
he had never seen a forged document related to Clines' profits.
   Secord and Hakim each earned $1.39 million during 1985 and 1986,
the documents showed.
   In addition, $141,084 in profits was received by Scitech, a
company jointly owned by Hakim and Secord, according to the
documents presented in court.
   Secord pleaded guilty last year to a felony count of making
false statements to the Iran-Contra congressional committees. He
was sentenced in January to two years' probation.
   Clines faces up to 16 years in prison and fines of up to $1
million if convicted.

<DATELINE>EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If hostilities erupt in the
Middle East, the Air Force will be armed with ``smart'' and deadly
high-tech weapons developed as a result of hard lessons learned the
last time America went to war.
   ``The Southeast Asia conflict changed armament development
forever,'' said Julie Massoni, historian for the Air Force
Development Test Center at Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida
Panhandle.
   The Air Force gave low priority to conventional bombs, missiles
and guns before the Vietnam War, focusing on aircraft development
and nuclear arms, Massoni said.
   As a result, high-performance jets were saddled with outdated
munitions, some dating to World War II, that limited their
capabilities in Vietnam.
   In the late 1960s, U.S. jets armed with iron bombs flew more
than 800 sorties against the Than Hoa Bridge, losing at least 10
aircraft and failing to bring down the span.
   In 1972, four F-4 Phantom II jets took only 15 minutes to
destroy the bridge with the first ``smart bombs.'' The laser-guided
Paveway I glide bombs were used with similar success against a
second bridge.
   ``The precision guided munitions that took out the bridges have
been termed by some as the most revolutionary change in the art of
warfare since the nuclear bomb,'' Massoni said.
   Eglin's Development Test Center, established in 1968, has been
responsible for many of those weapons and has even more formidable
bombs and missiles in the final stages of development.
   ``In general these weapons tend to work extemely well if no
countermeasures are taken,'' said Steve Kosiak, a senior analyst
with the Center for Defense Information, a private think tank in
Washington, D.C.
   The problem, he said, is most have not yet been tried in battle
against opposing military forces that can use electronic trickery
to fool radar-guided weapons, or smoke to mask targets from
television- and laser-guided bombs and missiles.
   One exception has been the successful use of laser-guided bombs
in the U.S. raid on Libya.
   Kosiak said the high cost of ``smart'' weapons limits their use
to high-value targets. Old-fashioned iron bombs may still be the
weapon of choice against such targets as factories and massed
armies, he said.
   However, merely having a high-tech weapon, even if it doesn't
work all the time, may inhibit an enemy, Kosiak said. Opposing
forces may not turn on anti-aircraft radar to avoid having it
destroyed by a radar-seeking missile.
   The Air Force arsenal of ``smart'' weapons now includes the
Paveway III, an advanced laser-guided bomb, and the GBU-15, an even
more accurate television-guided glide bomb. In tests, a GBU-15 hit
a billboard-type target measuring 40 feet by 40 feet after being
dropped five miles away.
   Eglin has completed development of a rocket-powered version, the
AGM-130 missile, that can be launched from at least 15 miles. No
decision has yet been made on production because of the cost,
according to Maj. Wayne Warren of Owensboro, Ky., lead engineer for
the project.
   The Air Force already has a television-guided, infrared missile,
the Maverick, introduced in 1972, but it is a relative lightweight
at 426 pounds. The AGM-130, like the GBU-15, actually is a kit for
converting existing 2,000-pound bombs, of which there are thousands.
   A TV guidance pod bolted to the nose makes a bomb ``smart'' and
adding the rocket motor to the tail turns it into a missile, Warren
said.
   Another weapon developed during the Vietnam War is the Shrike
missile that homes in on enemy radar used to guide anti-aircraft
missiles. An advanced version known as the HARM, or High Speed
Anti-Radiation Missile, was deployed in 1983.
   For air-to-air combat, U.S. fighters are armed with the
intermediate range, radar-guided Sparrow and the short-range,
heat-seeking Sidewinder missiles. The Sidewinder was deployed in
1953 and the Sparrow 10 years later, but each has undergone
numerous modifications to improve performance.
   The new Advanced Intermediate Range Air-to-Air Missile, or
AMRAAM, will give pilots ``launch and leave'' capability because it
has its own tiny but powerful radar for guidance. It also allows
pilots to fire at more than one target at the same time.
   About 175 AMRAAMs have been built, but a reliability problem has
delayed full-scale production, said Brig. Gen. Charles Franklin,
AMRAAM project director.
   Improvements in the manufacturing process are curing the problem
and the first operational versions are expected to be delivered
later this year, he said.

<DATELINE>CHAMPION CITY, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The paratrooper recalls
stepping off the plane a month ago, among the first American
soldiers to reach Saudi Arabia.
   ``Instant sweat. It had me wishing we were back in Panama,'' the
24-year-old North Carolinian said, asking that his name not be used.
   ``But we were pumped, ready for instant war ... Our feeling then
was that war was inevitable,'' he said, interviewed at the camp
first named All-American City and then changed to Champion City
because of Saudi objections.
   Now, uncertainty has replaced inevitability. With no enemy to
fight, the desert heat and deepening boredom are the most common
foes.
   ``We'd like to know how long we're going to stay,'' said Marine
Maj. Drew Bennett of New Orleans. ``We don't know anything.''
   Morale remains generally high among U.S. troops, but keeping it
high as Operation Desert Shield drags on could be a daunting
challenge, exacerbated by Saudi customs that prohibit alcohol and
discourage women from venturing into Saudi communities.
   ``They need to tell me when I'm going home,'' Air Force Staff
Sgt. Kenneth Williams said. ``I've got a wife and two kids.''
   Among the troops _ whether Air Force personnel sleeping in
air-conditioned tents, Army infantry in trailers or Marines under
the desert sky _ come the usual complaints: the food, the heat, the
slow mail service and the shortage of recreational facilities.
   ``There's not a whole lot you can do and there's no time to do
it in anyway,'' Air Force Sgt. Chris Jessen said during a break
from working on an F-15 fighter jet.
   After weeks of grumbling, a mail system is taking shape. But
that means some soldiers without letters have to watch others savor
the words from loved ones.
   Military chaplains are trying to collect and evenly distrubute
mail addressed to ``any soldier, any sailor or any airman.''
   Air Force officials believed they scored a morale-boosting coup
when they won time for the troops _ even women _ at an $80 million
Saudi military recreational facility that includes a swimming pool,
bowling alley, weight room and other equipment.
   Some women are upset because they have to enter through the back
door because of Saudi sensitivities.
   ``Being able to get the ladies in there at all is amazing,''
said Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Tom Sack.
   The military brass is also trying to do more for morale.
   Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf made a tour of several camps last
week. And word is circulating that Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, may visit next week.
   The U.S. Consulate is trying to help out by arranging a talent
show.
   ``We'll have to do some different things to keep up morale,''
said Col. John LeMoyne of the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division.
``Everybody would probably like a cold beer right now, but that's
just not the name of the game over here.''
   Every unit seems to have an entertainer or comedian among the
ranks.
   At the 82nd Airborne, one of the men entertains the troops by
reciting lines from old war movies.
   A member of a security patrol at a Saudi airbase hopped out of
his vehicle the other day during a sandstorm to etch a message on
the sand-crusted back window.
   ``Beach Party '90,'' the soldier wrote. ``Tide's Out _ Way Out.''

   American troops are clad in the
latest in combat clothing _ stylish two-piece suits specially
designed for desert duty _ but some soldiers are not convinced
their fashionable duds are functional.
   ``They're very hot and very uncomfortable,'' said Army Lt. Col.
Gene W. Cole, clad in his jumpsuit.
   ``It's hot and it makes me sweat,'' complained Lt. Col. Ned
Longsworth.
   Said Air Force Capt. Becky Colaw, ``There's a big difference
wearing it for work and wearing it to be cool.''
   The uniforms _ with a pattern called ``chocolate-chip
camouflage'' _ are 50 percent cotton and 50 percent nylon, a
combination designed to make the material tough but breathable.
   They come in varying tints. The lightest blends in well with the
sand and is the most popular. But the fabric is too heavy for the
100-plus desert temperatures, troops say.
   GIs generally keep their tunics on when they're outside to
prevent sunburn. The American women have been told to stay covered
so as not to offend Saudi sensibilities about bare skin.
   A rumpled forage hat, visored cap or jaunty beret is de rigeur.
A cotton scarf to wipe sweat from the brow or guard against a
sunburned neck is another must-have accessory.
   Slung around the soldiers' waists are the trappings of desert
life: a chemical gas mask, canteen, flashlight, knife. An M-16
slung over the shoulder is part of the uniform for some soldiers.
   Soldiers give the uniforms high marks for comfort.
   The baggy trousers have six pockets, including cargo pockets for
notebooks and assorted items. The tunic top has four pockets.
   ``They're designed to wear well even when they're dirty,'' said
Maj. Peggy Sweet, an Air Force logistics officer based at Myrtle
Beach, S.C.
   But the fit can be a problem for some.
   Like couturier outfits from Paris and Milan, the outfits hang
best on those who are tall and thin.
   ``It's a problem if you're short and fat,'' said Ms. Colaw.
   Troops from all services were issued two or three uniforms
before they left the United States. The outfits were specially
designed for desert situations, and this is the first time they
have been used in a deployment.
   T-shirts and underwear were not part of the package provided
soldiers, so Ms. Colaw said she bought herself male boxer shorts
because ``they're cooler than the women's kind.''

   Court reporters scurried for dictionaries _
again _ after a federal judge with a penchant for flowery language
uncorked another obscure term that bedeviled the uninformed.
   Judge Ferdinand Fernandez, who sits on the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, was speaking Friday about a death penalty case
when he said, ``I will not undertake to burden, bore or ensorcell
the reader by glossing what the Montana Supreme Court actually
wrote.''
   Ensorcell, which is unlikely to pop up in everyday conversation,
means to bewitch, enchant or bedevil.
   Fernandez was responsible for introducing facinorous
(atrociously wicked) and brume (mist) into the legal record in a
July ruling.

   The Soviet Union is standing together with the
United States and other Western governments in the Persian Gulf
crisis. But things could have been different.
   What if Mikhail S. Gorbachev had not become president and
introduced political and economic reforms? How would former Soviet
leaders, who sent tanks into Czechoslovakia and troops into
Afghanistan, have reacted to the actions of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein?
   Moscow News, nicknamed the ``glasnost weekly'' for its frequent
muckraking and acid commentary, has suggested a scenario that is
both humorous and chilling.
   The newspaper's ``political fantasy,'' published Aug. 26, begins
with staunch Soviet support for Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
It ends with Soviet and Western ships steaming toward a military
showdown. Along the way, it satirizes communist rhetoric and
official pronouncements.
   In reality, Gorbachev condemned the Iraqi invasion, cut off arms
shipments to Saddam, endorsed an economic embargo against Iraq and
supported a U.N. Security Council resolution allowing navies to use
force to maintain the embargo.
   Here, in abbreviated form, is Moscow News' fictional scenario of
what might have happened if Leonid Brezhnev, or someone like him,
were still running the Soviet Union:

<HEAD>National Baptists Urge Negotiated Settlement to Gulf Crisis
^By DAVID BRIGGS

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States needs to solve the Persian
Gulf crisis at the negotiating table rather than on the
battlefield, the nation's largest black church body has declared.
   ``We recall that our Christ reminds us that he or she who lives
by the sword will perish by the sword,'' said a resolution approved
Friday by delegates to the 110th annual meeting of the National
Baptist Convention U.S.A. Inc.
   The 7.8 million-member denomination supported President Bush's
decision to send U.S. troops to the Middle East, but said the
nation must deal with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein at an
international conference table.
   ``I just can't see lives being taken, fighting over oil,'' the
Rev. T.J. Jemison, convention president, said after the vote.
   The resolution was unanimously approved without discussion by
about 1,500 delegates representing the nation's third largest
Protestant denomination.
   The Baptist convention said Bush was correct to send troops to
the Middle East after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait to enable the
nation to negotiate from a position of strength.
   But there are other moral issues involved, the resolution said.
   ``We contend that if the United States wishes for the world to
move toward a democratic society, no matter how horrific the
position of Saddam Hussein might appear, we must deal with him in a
manner that he and all powers concerned in the Middle East are led
to the world conference table for a meaningful negotiated
settlement of the conflict,'' the resolution said.
   Pursuing a negotiated settlement through diplomacy will save
lives and billions of dollars best spent to ``feed the hungry,
clothe the naked, heal the sick, train the unlearned, house the
homeless and encourage the lonely,'' the resolution added.
   The denomination also commended the Rev. Jesse Jackson for
helping secure the release of some hostages.
   The Rev. Amos Brown, chairman of the Human Rights Commission,
said the vote sends a message that U.S. foreign policy needs to be
consistent and not ignore human rights violations in nations such
as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Israel.
   ``For instance, we're not invading South Africa'' to halt
apartheid, he said.
   Most major religious groups have responded cautiously to the
U.S. military deployment in the Middle East, balancing a
condemnation of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait with concerns that the
United States act out of humanitarian motives rather than to
protect oil interests.

   Asked why they have not deployed ground troops in
Saudi Arabia alongside U.S. forces, America's allies have an easy
answer _ the Saudis haven't invited them.
   This reply, however accurate, has failed to prevent increasingly
strident calls in the United States for its allies to share more of
the military burden _ and the risks _ in the showdown with Iraq's
Saddam Hussein.
   Britain says it plans to send more forces to the Persian Gulf,
possibly including ground troops. But other Western European
countries show no signs of similar action, citing the lack of a
formal Saudi invitation and various other reasons.
   France, which has mounted the second-largest Western deployment
in the gulf in the form of a naval task force, says it will not
help finance the U.S. effort and would probably join ground
operations only under U.N. auspices.
   Portugal, which has committed one naval support vessel to the
gulf, says its ground and air units wouldn't be effective.
   West Germany and Japan say their constitutions bar them from
deploying forces in far-off regions, although the Germans have
suggested the possibility of a constitutional amendment.
   Greece, Italy and Australia, which have dispatched a total of
nine warships to the gulf, say no one asked them to send ground
troops and the subject hasn't been considered.
   ``It wasn't necessary,'' said Vittorio Surdo, an Italian Foreign
Ministry spokesman. ``We think our contribution is important enough
in other respects.''
   U.S. officials say the cost of the 100,000-strong American force
in the region is about $1 billion a month. They are lobbying hard
for larger financial contributions from allies.
   The nations of the European Community agreed Friday to give $2
billion in economic aid to Turkey, Jordan and Egypt to compensate
them for trade lost as a result of sanctions against Iraq. However,
the 12 EC states made no promises to contribute to the cost of
deploying U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf.
   After the meeting, Italy's foreign minister, Gianni De Michelis,
told reporters, ``We want to contribute to the burden-sharing in an
independent and direct manner and not to the expenses of a separate
country, even though it is an ally.''
   So far, President Bush's administration has handled the issue of
ground troops with restraint. It has praised countries for even
modest naval contributions and made no specific public requests for
allied infantry units.
   But Secretary of State James A. Baker III, during a Senate
hearing Wednesday, conveyed growing impatience.
   ``We'd like to, frankly, see perhaps a few more ground troops in
there,'' he said. ``I think that there's a good chance that there
will be additional ground and air forces.''
   His comments followed blunt remarks from several senators,
including Democrat John F. Kerry of Massachusetts. Kerry recently
visited U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and told Baker he was upset by
what he found.
   ``I didn't notice any of our other allies, and that disturbs
me,'' Kerry said. ``It is one thing to be in the Persian Gulf on a
ship somewhat removed from the first line, and another to be up
there in the desert bearing that heat and the immediate risk.''
   Harsher commentary came Thursday in an editorial in The New York
Times.
   ``The arguments some Europeans and Japanese make for vacillating
are almost as repellent as the vacillation,'' said the editorial,
depicting such allies as ``sideline soldiers or deadbeats, eager
for us to protect their oil with our blood.''
   The Saudi government has been tight-lipped about details of its
requests for Western military aid.
   Diplomats say these requests are based on the kingdom's specific
needs and on past military dealings with individual countries. For
example, Britain and France were involved previously with Saudi air
defense and thus were asked to help in that field.
   Britain sent aircraft rather than ground troops ``because this
is what the Saudis asked us for, and this is all by invitation,'' a
British Defense Ministry spokesman said. ``They operate the same
type of Tornado (fighters) as we do and therefore have the ground
force facilities for those.''
   Britain has sent four warships to the Persian Gulf, one squadron
of Tornados to Saudi Arabia and one to Bahrain, a Jaguar squadron
to Oman, and a surface-to-air missile unit to Bahrain. Its total
force of just over 2,000 military personnel is the only significant
Western deployment aside from the United States and France.
   Several Western countries, among them Denmark and Norway, say
they might contribute ground troops to a U.N. peacekeeping force,
but not a U.S.-commanded force.
   Baker told Congress the United States does not want to put the
military effort under U.N. command.

   The phrasing of a question and answer in a sex
knowledge survey released Wednesday by the Kinsey Institute, and
reported by The Associated Press, may have been misleading.
   The true-false question stated, ``There are over-the-counter
spermicides people can buy at the drugstore that will kill the AIDS
virus.'' The correct answer given was ``True.''
   That does not mean the spermicides will cure AIDS, the Kinsey
report says. Instead, many health care professionals say using the
spermicides along with a condom may help protect against
transmission of the AIDS virus during sexual intercourse, the
report says.
   The spermicides include an ingredient called nonoxynol-9 that
can kill the AIDS virus in the test tube, the report says. June
Reinisch, director of the Kinsey Institute, said, ``It is very
likely to work in people.''

   The goverment has criticized comments by
army chief and former president Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who said the
German army has soldiers who are ``marijuana smokers, drug addicts,
long hairs, homosexuals and unionists.''
   Pinochet's comments ``may seriously jeopardize the friendly
relations between Chile and West Germany,'' Acting Foreign Minister
Patricio Rojas said Friday.
   Rojas said he relayed the government's position to German charge
d'affairs Hans Ulrich Spohn during a meeting Friday. The same day,
Bonn formally protested Pinochet's comments made during a speech
Wednesday.
   Pinochet later recanted, saying he did not intend to offend the
German army, and that his words were probably misinterpreted.
   Pinochet, who handed in power to President Patricio Aylwin last
March, has refused to step down as head of the army. He is
sheltered by a special clause in the 1980 constitution written by
his military regime, which lasted 16 years.

<HEAD>Brady Returns From Global Fund-Raising Effort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is declaring
his global fund-raising effort a success even though he received no
specific pledges of new assistance.
   Brady's delegation returned to Washington on Friday night
following an 18,500-mile journey that saw him hold hurried
consultations with world leaders in Paris, London, Seoul, South
Korea and Tokyo.
   In addition to Brady's mission, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III made a whirlwind tour seeking support from the oil-rich
countries of the Middle East.
   The United States is trying to raise more than $25 billion to
defray the costs of the American military buildup in the Persian
Gulf and provide emergency assistance to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey,
three countries which have been hard hit by the trade embargo
against Iraq.
   In each of the capitals Brady visited, he delivered the same
message and received virtually the same response.
   Brady was thanked for coming forward with a plan for
coordinating assistance and was politely told the country in
question would have to study the proposal further before making any
additional commitments of aid.
   Brady insisted he was not daunted by the lack of specifics
because he believed the delegation had made a convincing case at
each stop. He said the cost of failing to protect the Middle
Eastern oil fields was far higher than the sums being sought in the
U.S. aid package.
   ``Our principal message throughout this trip has been that there
is a cost which all must share in maintaining a freely flowing
source of oil,'' Brady said.
   He said that for Japan alone a $10 jump in oil prices represents
almost $20 billion in higher fuel bills.
   For South Korea, the annual cost in higher fuel bills was
estimated at $2.5 billion.
   Brady said he used those figures in his meetings Friday with
South Korean President Roh Tae-woo and Japanese Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu.
   Both countries are heavily dependent on the flow of Middle
Eastern oil.
   Oil, which was selling for around $18 per barrel before the Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait, has been trading around $30 a barrel in
recent days.
   Flying home from Tokyo, administration officials were upbeat
about their chances of ultimate success although one conceded that
full acceptance of the plan ``might take a little longer than we
had hoped.''
   The administration officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that Tokyo was being asked to increase
substantially its initial pledge of $1 billion.
   The officials said the total amount being sought from Japan was
higher than $2 billion with one official saying the request was for
``billions of dollars'' although he refused to quantify the number
any further.
   One official said he ``wouldn't be surprised if we got very
close'' to the figure being sought, even though Japanese officials
during Brady's visit had a lot of questions about how the economic
assistance money would be distributed.
   The administration had been expressing unhappiness privately
about the amount Japan has committed, given the fact that the
country has sent no troops to the Persian Gulf and has a vibrant
economy which imports 70 percent of its oil from the troubled
region.
   For its part, Japan has announced it will contribute $1 billion
to support the military forces in the Gulf and has indicated it is
willing to give humanitarian aid as well.
   While Kaifu made no specific commitment on additional funds,
U.S. officials said they were satisfied that their proposal would
get a serious review by his government.
   One official conceded that the various reports of dissension
over the details of the plan did not help that effort, but he
insisted the impact would be temporary.
   ``It's where you are a month or two from now that counts,'' said
the official on Brady's plane, who declined to be identified
further. ``He will understand billions of dollars'' in Western
support for the military and trade embargo.

   Vietnam next week will turn over 20
sets of remains that may be those of Americans missing from the
Vietnam War, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said today.
   A U.S. military team will go to Hanoi, Vietnam's capital, to
receive the remains Thursday and fly them to U.S. facilities for
analysis, said spokesman James Williams.
   It would be the largest return of remains since 28 sets were
handed over June 21, 1989.
   The United States withdrew from Vietnam in 1973, after losing
almost 58,000 lives in a failed attempt to protect the South
Vietnam government from the communist North Vietnamese. The
communists won and reunified the country in April 1975.
   The Pentagon lists 2,300 Americans as missing in action, or MIA:
1,677 in Vietnam, 534 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia and six in China's
coastal waters.

   Bulletproof back-to-school clothes are the
latest thing for New York City children who run a dangerous
gauntlet to and from class.
   School blazers, windbreakers and other jackets fitted with
bullet-resistant Kevlar 129 pads are providing a feeling of
security to parents undaunted by price tags ranging from $250 to
$600.
   Added shielding from flying bullets can be had from a
bulletproof book bag or clipboard.
   They're offered by former New York City police officer Stephen
D'Andrilli, whose security firm, Guardian Group International
Corp., is fielding inquiries about the jackets in New York and in
similarly crime-plagued Chicago and Los Angeles.
   Hairdresser John DeLoca, 41, is a satisfied customer who
recently bought $450 jackets for himself and his two sons, age 8
and 4.
   ``God forbid if they should be caught in a crossfire or a random
shooting, then $450 would seem like a pretty good investment,'' he
said. ``We're talking about my children's lives and the bottom line
is: You can't buy another kid.''
   Guardian Group has taken nearly three dozen back-to-school
orders, with hundreds of telephone inquiries promising more
business, D'Andrilli said.
   Demand comes after a rash of summertime child deaths in New
York, often by random gunfire. Four children were slain in an
eight-day period in August.
   New York is on its way to a record number of homicides for the
third straight year. There were 1,905 homicides citywide in 1989.
   Kevlar is a synthetic material five times stronger than steel
and relatively light. It is used in police bulletproof vests and
vehicle armor.
   Its composition is a closely guarded trade secret, but recent
technological advances made it 25 percent lighter and 40 percent
thinner than before, so it is less noticeable and more comfortable.
   D'Andrilli admits no clothing is ever truly ``bulletproof,'' but
demonstrates that Kevlar pads will stop slugs and can save lives.
   ``See here,'' said D'Andrilli, pointing to a swatch of Kevlar
fabric showing dents from two Uzi bullets. ``You may get bruises
from the impact, some trauma such as broken ribs, but the bullets
won't pierce the body,'' he said.
   In his office, D'Andrilli has a row of fashion dummies sporting
jackets, vests and T-shirts with panels of Kevlar concealed in
pouches. Joining the back-to-school lineup are Kevlar-lined fur
coats and business suits, briefcases and umbrellas.
   The line of fur and leather coats starts at about $3,000 and
tops out with a Russian sable coat for $80,000. The bulletproof
clipboard goes for $300.
   An 8-year-old boy named Palmer, in bow tie and red-and-white
pinstriped shirt, snapped on a denim jacket featuring Kevlar
``Silent Armor'' and said it felt only slightly heavier than normal.
   ``It feels good, it feels like you have good protection and
nobody even knows you have it on,'' Palmer said, patting the hidden
panels.
   His 6-year-old brother, Trevor, tried on a bright red
Kevlar-filled windbreaker and proudly announced: ``I might be an
undercover cop.''

   John Capps III knows all too well
what it's like to be lonely at the top.
   He's president of Bald Headed Men of America, a 20,000-member
organization in which it doesn't pay to get thin-skinned about
being thin-haired.
   This weekend, the organization is holding its 17th annual Bald
is Beautiful convention in Morehead City, the natural host for such
a meeting.
   ``We're growing because of lack of growth,'' Capps said. ``We're
proud of every hair we don't have.''
   About 200 bright and shining members are coming from as far away
as England to trade bald jokes and hold such contests as the Solar
Dome competition for best-tanned head. Winners are inducted into
the Bald of Fame.
   Society takes baldness too seriously, Capps insists. And that
can lead to some not-so-funny consequences.
   In the fourth hair-free generation of men in his family, Capps
got started early. At 15, he was already well on his way to
baldness.
   Although his family didn't make him feel out of place, Capps,
48, didn't find the rest of the world so understanding.
   He founded the organization after being turned down for a job by
a large Atlanta financial institution. Even though he was just out
of college, Capps said he was told the company was looking for a
``youthful, dynamic personality. And a baldheaded man, even one
just out of school, didn't fit in to those plans.
   ``Society can be pretty cruel,'' said Capps, who runs a print
shop in Morehead City.
   And so, along with the gags, conventioneers this weekend will
participate in workshops on baldness, self-esteem and sexuality.
   ``Baldness should be treated with positive mental attitude,'' he
said. ``What's in the head is more important than what's on top of
it.''

<TEXT>
   Sudan, traditionally Egypt's closest friend,
has broken with its big brother to the north by refusing to
denounce Saddam Hussein. The junta is paying back favors to Iraq
and trying to avert explosive domestic problems.
   But Sudan's strongman, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, is
increasing his own isolation among Arabs and within the
international community by joining the small group of nations
sympathizing with the Iraqi president.
   Western experts say the policy is calculated to increase
el-Bashir's popularity at home. He wants to draw attention from
Sudan's tottering economy by focusing on domestic sentiment against
the U.S.-led international military presence in the Persian Gulf,
they said.
   Aside from Sudan, the only Arab League members supporting or
willing to put up with Saddam's Aug. 2 invasion of neighboring
Kuwait are Jordan, Yemen, Tunisia, Algeria, Mauritania, Libya and
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   El-Bashir refused on Aug. 10 to join Egypt and 11 other Arab
League members in condemning the invasion. Since then he has made
trips and speeches denouncing the Western military buildup in Saudi
Arabia and calling for an Arab solution to the occupation of Kuwait.
   On Thursday, el-Bashir told scholars and politicians in Sudan's
capital, Khartoum, that the buildup was meant ``to change the
geopolitical situation in the area.''
   It's already changed in Sudan, said a Western diplomat in
Khartoum who follows that country's military affairs closely. In
recent years, he said by telephone, Iraq has become one of the
Sudan government's main sources of weapons to fight a 7-year-old
insurgency in the south.
   Sudan, in northeastern Africa, is the continent's largest
country, the size of the United States east of the Mississippi
River. As el-Bashir drew the country away from its traditionally
close ties with Egypt and the United States after his coup on June
30, 1989, Saddam filled the vacuum.
   The diplomatic source said Saddam last year sent el-Bashir
Soviet-made T-54 and T-55 tanks and artillery rockets. This year, a
loan of Iraqi transport planes, ammunition and other military
hardware prevented the Sudanese rebels from capturing the southern
capital, Juba, the source said.
   But he and other experts denied recurrent reports that Iraq has
based soldiers, warplanes and Scud surface-to-surface missiles in
Sudan since the Gulf crisis began. Sudan's government also has
denied the reports.
   Other specialists on Sudan agreed that keeping a new-found
friend happy might have something to do with el-Bashir's position.
But they said more important is his desire to exploit the gulf
crisis to gain popularity.
   ``Although Iraq did them a favor, the regime's primary concern
is the domestic situation,'' said Peter Woodward, a lecturer at the
University of Redding in England. ``They believe the anti-Western,
anti-American sentiment can bring them local popularity.''
   So far, el-Bashir's extreme martial-law rule has gained him
little popularity except from the small but well-organized Moslem
fundamentalist National Islamic Front. His harsh treatment of
dissidents and summary execution of 28 officers after an alleged
coup attempt last spring brought international outrage and
intensified his isolation.
   Since the gulf crisis began, thousands of Sudanese have
demonstrated in support of Saddam, and the Sudanese strongman has
visited Baghdad several times trying to mediate a diplomatic
solution.

   Law enforcement agencies must spend more
time and money fighting Asian crime syndicates, which are becoming
one of the most powerful criminal forces in the United States, the
FBI director says.
   Asian organized crime groups traditionally choose victims in
their own ethnic community, FBI Director William Sessions told a
gathering of business leaders Friday.
   ``Now they are extending their tentacles out to the rest of
American society,'' he said.
   ``Indeed, Asian crime groups are networking and interacting not
only with each other but with La Cosa Nostra and Colombian drug
cartels as well,'' he said.
   The FBI first became aware of the extent of Asian organized
crime when agents seized 900 pounds of 90 percent pure heroin worth
more than $1 billion in February 1989, Sessions said.
   ``Unfortunately, Asian criminal organizations are gaining larger
and stronger footholds around the country,'' Session said.
   Japanese, Vietnamese and Chinese organized crime groups are the
strongest in the United States, he said.

<TEXT>
   Japan and the Soviet Union view Mikhail Gorbachev's
coming trip to Tokyo as a sign frayed relations are on the mend,
but a territorial dispute over a group of small islands remains a
roadblock to normalization.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on Friday returned
to Moscow after three days of meetings in Tokyo, where he set an
April date for the Soviet president to visit Japan.
   It will be the first visit by a Soviet leader to Tokyo.
   Both sides noted a warming of long-strained relations during
Shevardnadze's visit and pledged to work toward closer ties.
   In a joint statement released Friday, the countries said ``both
sides must make efforts to make the visit to Japan by the Soviet
president a major turning point in Japan-U.S.S.R. relations.''
   But it was unclear whether the countries were any closer to
resolving a territorial dispute that has prevented the signing of a
peace treaty to formally end hostilities after World War II.
   ``I could not find any practical change in the attitude of the
Soviet Union on the territorial issue,'' Japanese Foreign Minister
Taro Nakayama said Friday after two days of talks with his Soviet
counterpart.
   For years, Tokyo has insisted that the sparsely populated Kuril
islands off northern Japan seized by the Soviet Union at the end of
the war must be returned before there can be any real progress in
economic or political ties.
   The chain of islands were Japanese territory from 1875 until
after the war.
   Shevardnadze, speaking at a news conference Friday, hinted that
Moscow was willing to talk and possibly make concessions.
   ``On a bilateral basis we may introduce some change, some
further amendments, but only in the spirit of negotiations and
based on a rational dialogue,'' Shevardnadze said.
   He also said the two countries were ready to discuss ``new
principles'' with Gorbachev's visit.
   That appeared to echo comments attributed to Gorbachev in recent
weeks that he was willing to talk about anything in a summit with
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   The Soviet Union has long sent conflicting signals on whether it
was willing to negotiate the fate of the islands.
   As recently as July, Gorbachev refused to discuss Japan's claim
to the disputed islands, saying the issue had been decided after
World War II and the Soviet Union abided by postwar arrangements.
   Some analysts say they expect the Soviets to seek a resolution
to the territorial issue to gain access to Japanese economic aid
and investment to help shore up the faltering Soviet economy.
   Moscow has said it wants increased Japanese economic
cooperation, particularly in remote Siberia.
   Japanese newspapers today applauded the apparent Soviet
flexibility toward the territorial dispute but noted that
resolution of the issue still seemed far away.
   The English-language Japan Times said in an editorial that
Shevardnadze's visit ``has produced a little brighter hope that
Japan and the Soviet Uion may manage to narrow differences'' over
the islands.
   The Daily Yomiuri said it agreed with Shevardnadze's assessment
that resolving the dispute would take a long time.
   ``There is no need for impatience,'' it said in an editorial.
``On the other hand, the promotion of improved relations should
never be used as an excuse to put off the territorial issue.''
   The Kuril islands were Japanese territory from 1875 until 1945,
when they were awarded to the Soviet Union at the Yalta conference
of Allied powers.

<HEAD>Youths Given Probation in Assault on Studds</HEAD>

   Two Maryland teen-agers are being sentenced to
probation and community service work for the June 7 beating of Rep.
Gerry Studds.
   U.S. Magistrate Patrick Attridge told the two youths Friday that
he seriously considered sending them to prison. He opted for
probation, saying drunkenness impaired their judgment at the time
of the assault. The two had pleaded guilty and Attridge also said
their admission of guilt played a part in his decision.
   James L. Byrne, 19, of Silver Spring, faces one year of
probation, 100 hours of community service and will pay $170 in
restitution. Thomas E. Carter, 19, also of Silver Spring, will
serve three years of probation, provide 100 hours of community
service, pay $170 in restitution and enroll in a program for
alcohol abusers.
   Attridge said Carter received a more severe sentence because he
had an undisclosed prior record.
   Studds' spokesman, Steven Schwadron, said he is certain the
nine-term liberal Democrat is ``glad that justice has been done.''
   Of the decision not to order prison time, Schwadron said, ``That
was a decision for the judge.''
   Byrne and Carter faced a maximum of one year in prison and a
$100,000 fine for assaulting a member of Congress.
   The attack took place as Studds was walking home alone from a
dinner party.
   The two youths, according to their own admissions, had been
drinking in a bar near Studds' residence, emerged from the bar and
were unable to remember where they'd parked their car.
   Carter said they became frustrated at being unable to find the
car and, for no particular reason, took out their frustration on
Studds.
   The congressman was punched in the face, knocked to the ground
and kicked, according to prosecutors and witnesses. Studds suffered
bruises and lacerations to the face and body but was not
hospitalized.
   The youths said they did not learn that they had attacked a
congressman until after the assault. They insisted the attack had
nothing to do with Studds being gay. Studds also said at the time
that he had no indication that the attack was a gay-bashing
incident.

<HEAD>Trial Ordered for Elderly Man Held in Mercy Killing Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lawyer for an elderly, California man
accused of helping his wife commit suicide says he doubts a jury
would convict him since he acted out of love.
   Bertram Harper was ordered Friday to stand trial on murder and
conspiracy charges in the Aug. 19 death of his wife, Virginia, in a
motel room.
   Harper, 72, could receive a life sentence.
   Harper's lawyer, Hugh Davis, said the murder charge wouldn't
stand up because Harper's help in securing a plastic bag over his
wife's head lacked the key element of malice.
   ``I don't think a jury's going to convict this man of
anything,'' Davis said. ``I don't believe an act of love is a
crime. This is a case of love and death, and which shall prevail?
We believe love will.''
   Mrs. Harper planned her suicide after learning she was
terminally ill with breast and liver cancer, her husband said.
   The murder case against Harper rests largely on his telling
police he had put the bag over his wife's head and secured it
around her neck after a non-lethal combination of pills and alcohol
put her to sleep.
   The official cause of death was asphyxiation, the Wayne County
medical examiner's office said.
   District Judge Henry Zaborowski ordered Harper tried on one
count of open murder, which may be defined at trial as first- or
second-degree murder or manslaughter, and one count of conspiracy
to commit murder.
   Under Michigan law, first-degree murder is punished by mandatory
life imprisonment; second-degree murder by up to life imprisonment;
and manslaughter by up to 15 years imprisonment.
   Harper told police they came to Michigan from their home in
Loomis, Calif., because they believed Michigan had no law making it
illegal to assist in a suicide. Under California law, such an act
is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.
   Shanda McGrew, 40, Mrs. Harper's daughter and Harper's
stepdaughter, flew to Michigan with them and was present at her
mother's death. She is an unindicted co-conspirator in the case.
   Zaborowski let Harper return to California under $25,000 bond.
He probably will not have to return to Michigan until his trial
begins in late October or early November, Davis said.

   A Cuban human rights group says Cuban
security agents harassed and threatened its five-member delegation
during a United Nations conference on crime-fighting in Havana this
week.
   The International League for Human Rights, which does
consultation work for the U.N., said its delegates were prevented
from attending the weeklong Seventh Congress on Crime that closed
Friday.
   The Cuban government of Fidel Castro had no immediate public
comment on the incidents. Dispatches on the conference by the
official Cuban news agency Prensa Latina from Havana, monitored in
the Mexican capital, made no mention of them.
   All five league delegates, including three Havana residents and
prominent Cuban human rights activists opposed to President
Castro's communist regime, were previously approved by the U.N.,
the league said.
   One of them, Yndamiro Restano, is a member of the Cuban
Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation.
   Another, Antonio de Varona Batlle served as defense counsel for
commission leader Elizardo Sanchez when Sanchez was recently tried
for ``disseminating false news against international peace.''
   Jorge Bacallao, the third, is a legal adviser to the Cuban Human
Rights Committee, another non-government group.
   The other two are Robert Cox, associate editor of the
Charleston, S.C., Courier Post, and Dianne Orentlicher, a lawyer
who taught at Yale, Harvard and Columbia universities.
   Both are on the league's board of directors.
   The delegates were not allowed to attend the conference despite
a personal invitation by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, the league said Friday in a news release from its base in
New York City.
   It quoted Cox as saying that state security groups, who appeared
to be ``out of control, ... harassed, intimidated and threatened''
the delegates throughout the meeting.
   Acting Foreign Minister Rolando Lopes del Amo also threatened
both Cox and the league, saying ``his government would oppose the
league's continued consultative status at the United Nations,'' the
league said.
   One of the Cubans ``was physically pushed out of the conference
hall'' and all three ``were physically detained temporarily by
security police in a hall off the conference site.''
   A security official named Felipe Zilla ``intimated to (Cox) that
Mr. Restano was in danger,'' the league said, and expressed concern
that the Cubans, ``threatened and followed by security officials,
may suffer reprisals'' now that the conference ended.
   The week long congress, held by the U.N. every five years, aims
at formulating guidelines on fighting crime while protecting
prisoners from abuse and their lawyers from reprisals in countries
under authoritarian governments.
   A Prensa Latina dispatch Friday only said 1,700 delegates from
129 nations held 14 plenary sessions and approved about 30
resolutions _ one of them praising the Castro government and the
Cuban people for their hospitality _ before it closed.
   Cox, an Englishman and editor of the Buenos Aires Herald at the
time, was awarded the United Kingdom's Order of the British Empire
for denouncing rights abuses by right-wing military regimes during
Argentina's ``dirty war'' against suspected leftist subversives in
the 1970s.
   Founded in 1942, the league has been accredited to the U.N. for
more than a half-century, working worldwide to combat rights
abuses. Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov was its honorary president
until he died last year.

<HEAD>Treaty Questions Raised by Planned Anti-Missile Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics say a planned Star Wars test in the
South Pacific comes close to violating a 1972 treaty outlawing
major missile defenses.
   Near the middle of the month, a Boeing 767 equipped with a 3-ton
infrared sensor will make its first attempt to track a mock warhead
on an intercontinental ballistic missile fired from Vandenberg Air
Force Base, Calif.
   The plane is scheduled to depart Boeing Field in Seattle on
Monday for a two-day trip to Kwajalein Atoll, an Army missile test
range in the Pacific.
   Anti-ballistic missile radar is prohibited by the 1972 ABM
Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union.
   John Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American
Scientists and a Star Wars critic, said the aircraft ``appears to
be the functional equivalent of an ABM radar.''
   Pike said the Soviets may be justified in questioning whether
the airborne sensor is a treaty violation.
   ``If we saw the Russians doing this kind of thing, we would be
pretty bent out of shape about it, and if the Russians were giving
the explanation we are, we wouldn't believe them,'' Pike said.
   The Army says the airborne sensor is not a prototype for an
anti-missile sensor system. It also argues that the aircraft could
not substitute for an ABM radar because of technical limitations in
its infrared sensor and its on-board computers.

<HEAD>Administration Reiterates That 1973 Decision Should Be Overturned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new administration broadside aimed at
legalized abortion suggests pro-choice advocates have much to fear
from Supreme Court nominee David Souter, says the executive
director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   In a Supreme Court brief filed Friday, Solicitor General Kenneth
Starr defended Reagan administration regulations that prohibit
government-financed family planning clinics from providing abortion
counseling. The regulations promulgated by the Department of Health
and Human Services in 1988 have been challenged by family planning
clinics, Planned Parenthood and other organizations.
   The solicitor general said ``we continue to believe'' that Roe
vs. Wade was ``wrongly decided and should be overruled.''
   But he stopped short of asking the justices to do so in pending
cases involving New York City family planning clinics.
   ``This is direct evidence that there is reason to fear Judge
Souter,'' said Kate Michelman of NARAL. ``The administration must
feel confident they will soon have the votes to overturn Roe.''
   The clinics are financed under a $200 million-a-year program
under Title 10 of the Public Health Service Act. The law forbids
the clinics from performing abortions but earlier regulations had
allowed counselors to advise women that terminating a pregnancy was
an option.
   The court is considering two cases from New York City in which
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the 1988 regulations
on a 2-1 vote. But some other federal appeals courts have ruled the
regulations were unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Want to Revive Windfall Profits Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oil jolt from the Persian Gulf crisis is
renewing calls in Congress for a windfall profits tax.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., and Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., have
announced separate measures to restore the tax, which was repealed
in 1987.
   Kanjorski's measure directs the tax revenue to pay the
government's cost of insuring depositors of failed savings and
loans. He estimated that it would raise $15 billion annually.
   Like Packwood's bill, Kanjorski's measure would impose a tax of
up to 70 percent on excessive profits from oil sales. Packwood gave
no estimate of how much money his measure would raise, but he said
it would be based on the earlier tax.
   Both measures face stiff opposition from representatives of
oil-producing states. They say such a tax discourages exploration
and production at a time when the domestic industry should be
trying to grow.

   The meeting Sunday in Helsinki, Finland,
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
will be the 22nd superpower summit.
   Summits began in World War II as the Allies debated the shape of
the postwar world. Here is a list:
   _ Tehran, Iran, Nov. 28-Dec. 1, 1943:
   The Big Three _ President Roosevelt, British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin of the Soviet Union _ discuss
the war against Germany. Stalin presses for a second front to
relieve Soviet armies.
   _ Yalta, Soviet Union, Feb. 4-11, 1945:
   Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin discuss the postwar world,
granting Stalin influence over the nations that ultimately form the
Soviet bloc.
   _ Potsdam, Germany, July 17-Aug. 2, 1945:
   President Truman and Clement Atlee, Churchill's successor, face
Stalin. Truman tells Stalin the United States has a powerful new
weapon, but doesn't say what it is.
   _ Geneva, July 18-23, 1955:
   President Eisenhower meets with Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin
and the leaders of England and France to discuss occupied Germany.
   _ Camp David, Md., Sept. 25-27, 1959:
   Nikita Khrushchev, as Soviet premier, meets Eisenhower during a
two-week visit to the United States. They agree to reopen talks on
the status of Berlin and issue a communique calling disarmament an
important issue.
   _ Paris, May 16, 1960:
   The meeting collapses on opening day when Khrushchev demands an
apology for the American U-2 spy plane shot down over the Soviet
Union. He withdraws an invitation for Eisenhower to visit the
Soviet Union.
   _ Vienna, Austria, June 3-4, 1961:
   President Kennedy and Khrushchev meet, but talks on a nuclear
test ban and arms control produce no agreement. They issue a joint
communique affirming their support for a neutral Laos and
willingness to maintain contact.
   _ Glassboro, N.J., June 23-25, 1967:
   President Johnson and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin meet but
resolve no differences over the Vietnam War, the Arab-Israeli war
and nuclear arms.
   _ Moscow, May 22-24, 1972:
   President Nixon and Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev meet, the
first time a U.S. president has visited Moscow. They sign
agreements on health, the environment and space and scientific
cooperation.
   _ Washington, June 18-25, 1973:
   Brezhnev and Nixon sign a pledge to seek agreement to end the
nuclear arms race in 1974 and a pledge to cooperate in avoiding
confrontations.
   _ Moscow, June 27-July 3, 1974:
   Nixon and Brezhnev sign a number of documents on nuclear
weapons, including one limiting underground nuclear explosions.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger says impeachment proceedings
hamper Nixon.
   _ Vladivostok, U.S.S.R., Nov. 23-24, 1974:
   President Ford and Brezhnev reach tentative agreement to limit
the number of strategic offensive nuclear weapons and delivery
vehicles, including multiple-warhead missiles.
   _ Helsinki, Finland, July 30-Aug. 2, 1975:
   Ford and Brezhnev are among leaders of 35 nations meeting on
European security. They report progress on strategic arms issues.
   _ Vienna, June 15-18, 1979:
   President Carter and Brezhnev conclude seven years of strategic
arms limitation talks with the signing of the SALT II treaty.
   _ Geneva, Nov. 19-21, 1985:
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev spend far
more time in private sessions than planned but do not reach any
breakthrough on major issues. Reagan calls it a ``fresh start'' in
relations.
   _ Reykjavik, Iceland, Oct. 11-12, 1986:
   Reagan and Gorbachev hold detailed talks on eliminating nuclear
weapons but disagree over the U.S. strategic defense initiative,
known as Star Wars.
   _ Washington, Dec. 8-10, 1987:
   Reagan and Gorbachev sign a treaty to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear forces, but disagreement over Star Wars
blocks progress on a strategic arms reduction treaty.
   _ Moscow, May 29-June 2, 1988:
   Reagan and Gorbachev exchange the ratified texts of the INF
treaty, discuss strategic and conventional arms and stroll in Red
Square. Reagan softens his criticism of Soviet human rights abuses;
Gorbachev complains of missed opportunities.
   _ New York, Dec. 7, 1988:
   Reagan, Gorbachev and President-elect Bush meet on Governor's
Island in New York harbor to discuss Gorbachev's announcement at
the United Nations that the Soviet Union will reduce its armed
forces by 500,000 men and withdraw 50,000 from Europe. Gorbachev
rushes home to cope with the earthquake in Armenia.
   _ Marsaxlokk Bay, Malta, Dec. 2-3, 1989:
   Bush and Gorbachev meet aboard a Soviet cruise liner for
dockside talks that produce no breakthroughs in superpower
relations. They agree it is time to end the Cold War, and Bush
pledges to take steps to ease U.S. tariffs on Soviet exports.
   _ Washington, May 30-June 3, 1990:
   Bush and Gorbachev seal agreements to slash long-range nuclear
weapons, halt production of chemical weapons and lift trade
barriers against Moscow. The two also discuss Lithuanian
independence, German unity and other developments in Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Finns Taking Higher International Profile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finns are taking a more active role in
international politics now that they don't have to worry so much
about upsetting the superpower next door.
   This democratic, free-market society has always been cautious
about swimming in the turbulent waters of international politics
for fear it would be caught in the Cold War battle. But with the
recent changes in the Soviet Union, and with the Soviets and the
West getting along better, the Finns are getting their feet wet.
   ``We are now driven to take stands on international issues. It
has been less so previously in the circumstances of the East-West
conflict,'' said Jaakko Blomberg, head of the political department
of Finland's Foreign Ministry.
   President Mauno Koivisto, whose nation plays host to the
U.S.-Soviet summit this weekend, gave a taste of things to come in
an unusually strong criticism of Iraq on national television.
   Manni Manninen, special counsel to the president, said that ``we
have chosen our policy to not get involved in issues over which the
superpowers disagree themselves.''
   Government officials, activists and academics now say there is
no longer the same basis for being quiet. For decades, successive
Social Democratic-dominated governments have repeated the canon
that neutrality _ coupled with a security and cooperation agreement
with the Soviet Union _ was in Finland's best interest.
   The policy was seldom debated in this country which shares an
800-mile border with the Soviet Union.
   Many ``Finns on the street'' still believe that keeping a low
international profile is the best policy for their country, which
fought from 1939 to 44 in order to remain independent.
   But the changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have
opened up whole new areas for discussion. One of them is the
possibility of Finland joining the European Community.
   ``Such a debate would not have taken place before. Let's be
frank,'' Blomberg said.
   ``For the first time in a long time, a real substantial foreign
policy debate is evolving,'' said Max Jakobson, Finland's
ambassador to the United Nations from 1965-72. Jakobson was the
Scandinavian governments' candidate for U.N. secretary-general in
1971, but there was speculation abroad that the Soviets blocked his
appointment because of his right-wing leanings.
   ``In earlier periods there was a sense of living under a certain
threat and there was a strong consensus in Finland that it was
important to support the policy of neutrality,'' said Jakobson, who
is not a member of any party.
   Presidential counselor Manninen said, ``The Finnish doctrine has
been, and still is, that Finland strives to keep herself outside
superpower conflicts, not to involve herself with issues in which
the superpowers disagree between themselves.''
   Now that the confrontation between the Soviet Union and the
United States ``has more or less ended and is moving toward
cooperation, as manifested in the present gulf crisis, this
doctrine cannot any more be applied because the superpowers agree,
rather than disagree,'' he said.
   ``That doesn't automatically mean we are going to start chatting
about everything, shooting from the hip at everything that moves,''
Manninen said.
   Blomberg said of the Persian Gulf crisis, ``You could imagine
what the consequences would be if the Soviet Union and the United
States had not seen it the same way.''
   ``We would in that situation seek a role that we traditionally
serve, that of peacekeepers,'' he said. ``That's what we do.''
   Finland has contributed to every United Nations peacekeeping
operation and currently has more troops on U.N. duty than any other
country.
   While the Finns now have more options in reacting to
international events, they know that circumstances change.
   ``Our policy has always been, and will always be, that we are
cautious,'' said Manninen. ``We cannot change our geography so we
will always be neighbors with (the Soviet Union) and they will
always be a great power.''
   ``Neutrality is like an umbrella you carry with you in case it
rains,'' said Jakobson. ``You cannot throw it away when the sun
shines.''

   An attorney for Rodney Dangerfield says the
comedian will press on Monday with a lawsuit against Caesars Palace
after negotiations over an out-of-court settlement fell apart.
   The lawyer, Barry Langberg, said Friday the talks ended last
month when attorneys for Caesars filed court papers claiming
Dangerfield was a chronic cocaine, marijuana and alcohol abuser.
   ``The chances of a settlement are almost nil now that Caesars
has chosen to take the tack they have,'' Langberg said.
   The lawsuit claims gross negligence and breach of contract
stemming from a March 1988 incident in which Dangerfield says he
suffered eye damage after being scalded in a steamroom at the hotel.
   Caesars has filed a breach of contract countersuit against
Dangerfield that seeks $100,000 plus punitive damages.
   The trial on Dangerfield's lawsuit was scheduled to begin Monday.

   The Beach Boys have donated $7,000 to
the Isle of Palms Volunteer Fire Department to help rebuild a fire
station destroyed by Hurricane Hugo last year.
   Department officials had hoped to raise $50,000 during a concert
with the Beach Boys, the Rivieras and The Marshall Tucker Band, but
the event only netted about $1,500.
   The department could barely pay the Beach Boys their $75,000
minimum charge.
   Fire Chief Larry Britton said Thursday he received a $7,000
check from Brother Records, management for the Beach Boys.
   Britton also said Brother Records promised a larger check in
about two weeks. He said he has no idea how much it might be.

   Kitty Dukakis says she would not object to her
husband running for president again.
   ``You know, I look at other political leaders who have said they
would never do such and such,'' Mrs. Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, said in an interview Friday with Barbara
Walters on ABC's 20-20.
   ``I think it's a mistake to make those kinds of pronouncements.
I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow,'' Mrs. Dukakis said.
   Mrs. Dukakis chronicles her problems with drug and alcohol abuse
in a new book, ``Now You Know.'' She described herself as
manic-depressive and said she would not have been able to handle
the pressures of being first lady had Dukakis won in 1988.
   ``Not so long ago (I) came perilously close to becoming the
first lady of the United States. I say perilously only for myself,
not the country,'' Mrs. Dukakis told Walters.

<HEAD>Rushdie Publisher to Issue Book That Answers `Satanic Verses'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOMBAY, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Islamic scholar has written a book he
says will refute ``The Satanic Verses,'' the novel that sent author
Salman Rushdie into hiding to escape death at the hands of enraged
Moslems.
   The new book is scheduled for release next April by Penguin,
which also published the Rushdie novel in 1988, setting off
worldwide protests, riots, diplomatic standoffs and debates on
freedom of expression.
   The Bombay-born Rushdie, now a naturalized British citizen, has
been in hiding since Feb. 14, 1989, when Iran's late leader, the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, ordered Moslems to execute Rushdie for
blasphemy.
   Rafiq Zakaria, a Bombay Moslem whose 70,000-word manuscript has
been accepted by the London-based Penguin publishing company, said
his book is to expose the ``baselessness of whatever Rushdie
attributed to the prophet'' Mohammed.
   He described his book, ``Muhammad and the Quran,'' as ``a case
for Islam.''
   ``I believe that the evidence is so overwhelmingly against what
Rushdie has written that the best answer is to convict him
intellectually and not physically,'' Zakaria said.
   Moslems worldwide objected to Rushdie using the names of
Mohammed's wives for prostitutes in his novel and the implication
that the prophet wrote the Koran _ Islam's holy book _ instead of
receiving it from God.
   A week after Khomeini's death edict, Bombay became the
flashpoint of anti-Rushdie protests that spread to other Indian
cities. In the following days, at least 19 people died in riots and
clashes with police in India and neighboring Pakistan.
   India, Pakistan, Iran and several other countries banned ``The
Satanic Verses.'' Later, Iran severed diplomatic ties with Britain,
accusing the British government of supporting Rushdie.
   ``I have traced the campaign of calumny against Islam right from
the birth of the prophet and culminating in Rushdie's book,'' said
Zakaria.
   A senior editor of Penguin Books Ltd. in London said a paperback
edition of ``Muhammad and the Quran'' will be published by April.
   The editor said, however, the book was not planned as a reaction
to ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``It is an incredibly impressive study of the thinking of Islam
looking at Western prejudices,'' she said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Zakaria, a 64-year-old academician and author of seven previous
books, described his latest effort as ``maybe a reaction to the
vituperative attacks and innuendos by Rushdie and his
predecessors.''
   ``I have tried to show how most of it is based on deep-rooted
prejudice first between Moslems and Jews and then between Moslems
and Christians,'' he said.
   The author attributed the ``unfortunately'' large sales of
Rushdie's book to Khomeini's death threat but said he neither
condemned the order nor upheld it because, ``by doing so I take a
pontifical position.''
   Nobody can take a pontifical position in Islam because the
religion does not recognize priesthood and teaches that there is no
intermediary between man and God, he said.

   A Georgia woman has identified her son as
the American wounded by Iraqi troops while trying to avoid capture
in Kuwait this week.
   The State Department refused to identify the American shot
Thursday while trying to flee from his apartment in Kuwait City.
   Mrs. Cullen Hoffman, who would not give her first name,
identified the American as her son, 33-year-old Miles Hoffman, a
financial analyst and investor for the Kuwaiti government.
   Mrs. Hoffman, from Columbus, said she didn't know her son's
condition. She said State Department officials told her Friday they
were trying to get American authorities in to see him and that he
was expected to be discharged soon from a hospital but will remain
in Iraqi custody.
   On Thursday, State Department spokesman Mark Dillen said an
account of the shooting was provided to a U.S. consular officer who
interviewed a friend of the victim.
   The friend, taken into custody by the Iraqis, said the American
was shot in the forearm while trying to escape through an apartment
window. He was taken initially to one hospital in Kuwait and then
to another.
   Dillen said Iraqi officials in Baghdad confirmed the injury
Thursday but said it was not serious.
   ``They say that he will be discharged from the hospital within
24 hours, but will remain in their custody. They promise us
consular access at that time,'' he said.
   Family members last talked to Hoffman on Aug. 4, two days after
Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait. He told them he was not afraid for his
life but for his job.
   Hoffman, engaged to marry British school teacher Nikki
Murgatroyd on Aug. 17, went to work for the Kuwait government in
1987.
   ``He met someone at a cocktail party who told him of all these
opportunities in Kuwait. Next thing I know, he's heading over
there,'' Mrs. Hoffman said. ``He was home to visit us in July and
he couldn't say enough nice things about Kuwait.''

   China has adopted its first copyright law,
according to official reports today.
   The law was approved by the standing committee of the National
People's Congress, China's legislature, when it ended an 11-day
session Friday. It goes into effect June 1, 1991.
   The law protects an author's right to publish, sign and revise
work. It guarantees the author's control of distribution and claim
to royalties.
   The law covers literature, art, natural sciences, social
sciences, engineering and technology produced in written, oral,
musical, photographic, cinematographic, video or computer software
format.
   The copyright of a work is valid during the author's lifetime
and for 50 years after his death. Material banned by Chinese law is
not protected.

   Hundreds of people looked on as a man shot
himself in the head and tumbled from the top of a 16-story building
after a standoff with police.
   ``All he wanted was attention,'' Police Chief Mayer DeRoy said
after the gunman committed suicide Friday. ``It ended in tragedy
and we're sorry about that.''
   Paul Fisher, 30, shot himself after holding police at bay for 5{
hours with a rifle and a handgun from the rooftop of an apartment
building near his home in the city's densely populated Oakland
section, authorities said.
   ``This is a suicide note. I just wanted the police to kill me,''
said a message that WTAE-TV reported was found on Fisher's body.
   ``He said he was going to jump since we wouldn't assassinate
him,'' DeRoy said.
   Fisher, who had a history of mental illness, fired at least 12
shots, one at an unmarked police car and 11 randomly into the air,
authorities said. No one was injured by those shots.
   Fisher climbed on the roof of Moorehead Towers before noon with
the two guns and 50 rounds of ammunition in a duffel bag, DeRoy
said.
   After telling police he wanted a few minutes alone, he climbed
to the roof's tallest parapet, dangled his feet over a ledge and
smoked a cigarette.
   Staring into space, Fisher put a .25-caliber pistol to his head
as DeRoy pleaded: ``Paul, Paul, don't pull the trigger.''
   The impact of the gunshot hurtled Fisher into the air as
onlookers gasped and police and medics sped to the scene.
   Police said they could not immediately say why Fisher committed
suicide because he refused to be specific with negotiators.
   Pittsburgh's three network-affiliated television stations _
WTAE, WPXI and KDKA _ filmed the scene but did not broadcast their
videotape because of company policies against showing suicides.
   In 1986, Pennsylvania Treasurer R. Budd Dwyer killed himself at
a news conference he called in Harrisburg to discuss a federal
indictment against him. He put a gun in his mouth and pulled the
trigger, a scene that was broadcast by some Pennsylvania television
stations.
   CNN Headline News showed footage of Fisher's last moments.
   ``The reason we did it is that we were covering the story when
it first broke and we were continuing to tell the story,'' said Meg
Andre, a supervising producer at Headline News.
   Today's Pittsburgh Post-Gazette had a front-page photograph of
Fisher tumbling from the high-rise. The Pittsburgh Press planned to
run a photograph of Fisher just after he shot himself on an inside
page of today's newspaper, said Tom Birdsong, night city editor.
   The Associated Press transmitted two photographs, one showing
Fisher falling and the other showing him holding a rifle as he
stood on the building's edge.

<TEXT>
   Despite persistent problems, U.S.
officers say mail is reaching most U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia
within eight days.
   The officers say that's a considerable improvement over the
average eight to 10 days of the last few weeks, but they
acknowledge smaller units still don't get mail regularly.
   Outgoing mail has been impeded by small problems, such as stamps
sticking together in the desert heat, the officers said. The U.S.
Postal Service said Friday it was sending self-adhesive stamps that
don't curl and stick together. But overall, the system is working
smoothly, officers said.
   The military on Friday lifted a 12-ounce limit on packages sent
to troops in Saudi Arabia, saying there was now a sufficient postal
system and airlift capability in place to handle a larger volume of
mail.
   Air Force Maj. Michael Whitaker, commander of the main Central
Command postal operation in Saudi Arabia, said the military postal
service agency would notify all post offices in the United States
of the change.
   Over the past five weeks since the U.S. began sending troops to
Saudi Arabia, many soldiers have complained of poor mail service.
Marines in the most forward positions appear to have more problems
than the army or air force.
   ``There's always going to be some glitches no matter how good
the system is,'' said Capt. Bradley J. Seibel, 30, of Edwardsburg,
Mich.
   His 129th Postal Company is handling six tons of incoming mail
daily and the load is ``steadily increasing.''
   He said, however, that incoming mail is processed in 12 to 24
hours.
   On Friday, 10 clerks sorted mail at the base post office.
Mailbags were stacked up, but there was nothing to suggest a huge
backlog.
   For American civilians living in Saudi Arabia and other Persian
Gulf Arab states, mail to and from the United States usually takes
at least a week, more commonly 10 days or more.
   Seibel said the typical military unit arriving in the kingdom
``doesn't get a whole lot of mail until they've been here a couple
of weeks.''
   He said the army is expanding mail deliveries and will soon
augment his unit with a reserve company of clerks from Athens, Ga.
   Marines and Air Force personnel distribute their own mail after
picking it up at an airbase.
   Postal officers said the Saudis were helping with mail
processing and were considering a U.S. request that they work on
what would normally be their days off including Friday, the Moslem
sabbath.
   All packages are opened by Saudi customs officers who look for
contraband, including alcohol, tobacco, pornography and religious
items such as crucifixes and the New Testament.
   Under Saudi law, pornography includes any magazine with pictures
of scantily clad women, including mail order catalogues.
   Siebel said he knew of only one case of a soldier facing
discipline for smuggling liquor, after his wife sent a package
containing two bottles of whiskey and one of vodka.

   A statue of a partially nude woman was
removed from a sculpture exhibit in the same city where rappers 2
Live Crew were arrested on obscenity charges.
   The 42-piece exhibit that opened Thursday at the Art and Culture
Center did so without a life-size statue called Ms. America.
   The statue's exposed nipples are pierced with hoops held
together by a gold chain and the torso is covered with colorful
tattoos.
   After consulting with Mayor Sal Oliveri, center Director Wendy
Blazier decided this week to pull the statue from the show, Oliveri
said.
   The mayor said Blazier, a city employee, told him she was
concerned the sculpture would offend someone.
   Oliveri, who has had no qualms about criticizing art and music
in Hollywood, said he never implied to Blazier that Ms. America be
banned from the exhibit, which features the work of Florida artists.
   ``She showed me the statue and asked me if I thought it was
offensive,'' Oliveri said. ``I told her that it was being displayed
in the right place, an arts center. I just told her I didn't think
children should see it, but I never meant for her to pull it from
the exhibit.''
   In June, Oliveri suggested 2 Live Crew not be allowed to perform
its racy lyrics at a downtown nightclub. The concert did go on and
the Miami rap group was arrested for performing songs from their
million-selling album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be,'' which a
federal judge ruled obscene.
   Oliveri said he did not know why Blazier even sought his opinion
on the statue, created by Sarasota artist Jack Down. But he said he
suspected it was because last month he suggested that a motel owner
alter a roadside mural showing the bare backsides of a man and a
woman.
   Oliveri said he wanted to promote a family-style image for the
city and that the mural did not fit with that image.
   Blazier would not comment.

   The Missionaries of Charity grew from Mother Teresa's calling 43
years ago to leave convent teaching and plunge into Calcutta's most
impoverished sections. She became known as ``the saint of the
gutters.''
   The simplicity of her religious life was often contrasted
against the complexity of world events and controversial issues.
   In 1982, she helped evacuate mentally retarded children from
Beirut, Lebanon, during the height of battles between Israeli
troops and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Her order has
also stressed Vatican-approved natural family planning methods
despite the severe overpopulation in India and other nations.
   Mother Teresa has been Pope John Paul II's ambassador against
abortion but led most other church groups by opening centers for
AIDS victims. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.
   Mother Teresa suffered a serious heart attack in September 1989
and received a pacemaker in December.

   The 165 Americans who stepped off a plane
from Kuwait leaving behind possessions and lives have brought
harrowing tales of life under Iraqi occupation of the oil-rich
emirate.
   U.S. Officials said the former detainees, who arrived in the
Jordanian capital aboard a U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways jet, would
probably be flown to Charleston, S.C., today.
   It was the first U.S.-arranged flight from Kuwait, which was
overrun by Iraq on Aug. 2. Most aboard were women and children, but
there were some Arab-American husbands and a few other men.
   Elena Reyes of Los Angeles described the last five weeks in
Kuwait as ``terrifying.''
   ``I didn't know night and day when they would come and knock
down my door,'' she said.
   Reyes said she felt ``relieved but still worried. You left part
of your life back there.''
   Another American woman, Patricia Hammer, originally from Denver,
described her foiled desert escape, a frantic house-to-house search
for safety, and the pain of leaving her children behind.
   And Mary Willett, 35, of Chicago, said of the situation in
Kuwait: ``It's a disaster.''
   The flight stopped over in Baghdad, where passengers obtained
exit permits from Iraqi authorities before leaving for Amman.
   On arrival, the Americans were taken to the airport hotel to
wait for the flight home. State Department spokesman Mark Dillen
put the number of Americans on the flight at 165 and said there
were a few other foreigners on board.
   Many in the group seemed overwhelmed by their experience, eager
to talk even if they did not give their full names.
   Maureen Aldakheel of St. Louis, asked what advice she would give
President Bush, replied: ``Go for it. Do something. People are
tired of waiting for something to happen.''
   ``People are very tired of waiting every day, hoping for news of
some military strike,'' said Mrs. Aldakheel, who lived in Kuwait
for 11 years and left her husband behind.
   ``I don't want war, but it's inevitable,'' said Sandra Williams,
who said she was from Ohio but gave no city. ``You're dealing with
a madman.''
   The Americans in the group were among the first airlifted from
Kuwait.
   A handful of U.S. citizens in Kuwait were flown on an Iraqi
Airways flight to Baghdad last week, escorted by civil rights
leader Jesse Jackson. Most other foreign evacuees have had to cross
the desert to Baghdad to catch flights out.
   Mrs. Hammer described the fear-filled days that followed the
invasion.
   At first, Iraqi jets streaked over rooftops to frighten the
population, she said. Later, patrols and roadblocks had people
cowering behind locked doors.
   ``People are now terrified, hiding, and they don't know what to
do next,'' she said.
   After the invasion, she joined a jeep caravan to try a run for
it across open desert to Saudi Arabia.
   ``Iraqis shot at us, and then our escorts abandoned us in the
desert,'' Mrs. Hammer said. ``Then some Bedouins saved our lives
and got us back to Kuwait.''
   Her Kuwaiti landlord brought food until word went out that Arabs
would be executed for helping foreigners. She found another place
to hide with other Americans. Finally, the flight was arranged.
   ``This morning, I dressed up in a black veil like an Iranian
Shiite woman and made my way to the pickup point,'' she said.
   Mrs. Hammer, who spent eight years in Kuwait, had to leave
behind her two children, Alia, 14, and Issa, 9. She said she just
divorced her Kuwaiti husband, and he refused to let them go.
   ``Now that it's over, I don't know what I will do. I left
everything. I left my children, my money.'' She stopped. ``How can
I put those two in the same sentence?''
   Her strength faded, and tears softened her eye makeup. ``I have
nothing left, nothing at all.''

<TEXT>
   Typhoon Dot was downgraded to a tropical
storm today after battering Taiwan and the Philippines and leaving
at least seven people dead in the two nations, authorities said.
   Four people were missing in northern and eastern Taiwan, police
said. One man was swept out to sea when fishing, while a woman and
two men were washed away by flooded creeks, they said.
   On Friday, police said that in Taipei two 9-year-old girls
drowned while playing in flooded ponds, and a man died after being
struck by falling objects.
   In the Philippines, the National Red Cross said today four
people drowned in flooding caused by Typhoon Dot.
   The Central Weather Bureau said Dot's maximum winds of 105 mph
had weakened overnight to 60 mph. A typhoon's winds are at least 74
mph.
   This afternoon, the storm was located 72 miles west of Taiwan,
moving northwest at 12 mph. It was expected to leave Taiwan by this
evening for China's southern Fujian province.
   Police in Hualien, 110 miles southeast of Taipei, said huge
waves smashed through a dike protecting a seaside village, but 50
people were rescued unharmed. There were no immediate reports of
injuries.
   Landslides disrupted train and highway traffic in eastern
Taiwan, and wide power outages affected 850,000 households in the
northern and eastern areas of the island, officials said.
   Most domestic flights were canceled and several international
flights were delayed, officials said.
   In the Philippines, the Red Cross said three of the drownings
occurred in Luzon's Abra province and the other in Pangasinan
province. More than 15,000 fled their homes in Manila and other
cities on Luzon island because of flooding caused by Dot, the group
said.
   Dot hit the Philippines late Thursday before swinging toward
Taiwan.

   When word reached Provo that one of their
own, Brian Watkins, was stabbed to death in a New York subway
station trying to defend his mother, the family's Mormon neighbors
pitched in to ease the grief.
   Women of the church's Relief Society prepared casseroles,
lasagna, shepherd's pie, rolls and chicken soup. They cleaned the
family's house, helped pick out funeral-going clothes and did other
chores.
   ``The first thing I do is cry a little,'' neighbor and society
president Margie Holmes said Friday, the day eight young men were
indicted in New York on murder and robbery charges in the case.
   ``And then I remind myself that somehow we'll get through it
all,'' she said.
   Watkins was to be buried today in Provo.
   He was 22, a tennis buff. He went to New York with his parents,
Karen and Sherman Watkins, and other relatives for the U.S. Open as
they had for many years.
   The eight men were accused of killing Watkins last Sunday after
robbing his father of $200 and credit cards. Police said the gang
wanted the money to pay the cover fee to a dance hall. They were
ordered jailed pending a Sept. 24 bond hearing.
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said he promised
Watkins' father that the eight defendants would not be offered plea
bargains.
   Seven of the defendants made incriminating videotaped statements
after their arrests, Morgenthau said.
   Two others were still being sought in Watkins' slaying, he said.
   The Watkins family returned to Provo on Wednesday after
testifying in New York before a grand jury.
   For the 100 or so families that live in the Watkins'
neighborhood, the congregation is a nucleus of worship and
friendship in a faith that prizes industrious self-reliance.
   The Watkins' pain is all too familiar to Mrs. Holmes. Four years
ago she lost her 18-year-old son, also named Brian, to a drug
overdose.
   ``People were doing this for me. I can't tell you how much it
helped me make it through that time,'' Mrs. Holmes said. ``There
was such an outpouring of love for our family.''
   Karen Watkins said the family will visit New York again.
   ``Probably not for a while, but the people in New York, the
majority of the people in New York, responded very well to us, very
compassionately, and just opened their arms to us with anything
they could give us,'' she said.

   A trotter horse that escaped from a
keeper galloped through a National Guard training base, where he
took on military aircraft and won _ at least temporarily.
   Shayne Gregory was out with the horse, Star O Cathy, for a
workout Friday at Los Alamitos race track when the animal threw her
and shook off the training cart, track spokesman Don Escalante said.
   The horse trotted over to an adjacent golf course, then took off
down a street and later a busy boulevard. After running through
traffic, Star O Cathy sped through the guard gate at Los Alamitos
Armed Forces Reserve Center and onto the base's main aircraft
runway.
   Star O Cathy's presence on the runway temporarily halted air
operations at the base, where air traffic has been heavy since the
U.S. deployment of troops to the Middle East began last month.
   First, the horse stood in the way of a C-5 transport plane
awaiting takeoff. Then he delayed the landings of two helicopters.
   Finally, track officials, with a horse van in tow, caught up
with the spirited steed and base operations returned to normal,
Escalante said.
   Base officials could not be reached for comment late Friday.

<TEXT>
   President Bush arrived in this Finnish
capital today with words of warm praise for Finland's stand ``with
the forces of peace'' arrayed against Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
   Bush and his wife Barbara received a red-carpet welcome from
Finnish President Mauno Koivisto and his wife Tellervo after
arriving at Helsinki International Airport on the first overseas
flight aboard the new Air Force One, a gleaming jumbo jet.
   Bush, arriving several hours ahead of Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev in advance of their summit together Sunday, praised
Helsinki's past role as a meeting-place for peace-seekers. At a
time of crisis in the Persian Gulf, Bush said, ``Much is at stake
and there is much the world stands to gain if we succeed.''
   ``The city of Helsinki has often been a meeting place for
nations seeking to advance the cause of peace. My thanks to the
people of Finland first for hosting this meeting and for setting an
example for all the world in your resolute commitment to liberty
and independence,'' Bush said.
   He thanked Finland for ``its staunch support'' in the United
Nations Security Council for the economic straitjacket imposed upon
Iraq for its occupation of Kuwait.
   ``Today at this time of challenge, Finland once again stands
with the forces of peace,'' said the president.
   Earlier, Bush said he had no plans to ask Gorbachev to send
ground forces to Saudi Arabia but expects talks on ``a wide array
of cooperative arrangements'' when they meet Sunday.
   Speaking to reporters accompanying him aboard Air Force One,
Bush said he was interested in trading U.S. oil technology for oil
from the Soviet Union and that an oil deal ``could well come up at
these meetings.''
   ``I think it's something that we can work closely with the
Soviet Union,'' he said.
   The president also said he wants to visit U.S. troops deployed
in Saudi Arabia, but ``Not now.''
   ``Eventually I want very much to do it, but I may wait for a
while until all our forces are there and things calm down and (the
troops) get settled in,'' Bush said. ``I very much want to do it,
but I have no schedule or plans, no set plans.''
   Bush also said he has no plans to ask for Soviet ground forces
to serve with U.S. troops deployed in Saudi Arabia.
   ``I have no plans to do that, but I will be talking about a wide
array of cooperative arrangements,'' the president replied.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said earlier
in the day that the Soviet Union would be willing to send military
forces to the Middle East under a military staff committee that
included officers from the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council.
   Asked about trading technology for oil with the Soviets, Bush
said: ``I'm all for that. I've already told Mr. Gorbachev that.
That came up when he was here. ''
   The president said he would ``welcome the best in American ...
drilling, production and seismic work going to the Soviet Union.''
He noted that some U.S. companies, including Chevron and Texaco
Corp., have reached preliminary agreements on joint oil exploratory
ventures with the Soviets.
   A group of U.S. oil executives were traveling to the Soviet
Union this weekend at the behest of Bush and planned to share new
technology that might immediately boost Soviet oil production.
   Just before leaving, Bush signed an order releasing $10 million
from U.S. emergency funds to aid refugees in Jordan and other
Middle East countries, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Administration officials said that the summit was designed as an
informal session for consultation and was unlikely to produce any
major announcements or new initiatives.
   The new Air Force One, a modified Boeing 747 jetliner, took a
little more than eight hours to complete the transatlantic trip.
Bush first flew in the plane Thursday.
   After arriving, Bush and his wife drove to Finland's
presidential palace for lunch with President and Mrs. Koivisto.
   Then, Bush was to make a short stop at the U.S. Embassy to speak
with American diplomats before checking into government guest
quarters at the Kalastajatorppa Hotel.
   Bush will return to Washington Sunday evening after his sessions
with Gorbachev. He will address a joint session of Congress Tuesday
night on the Middle East situation and on the summit.

   Finnish President Mauno Koivisto says
the United Nations economic sanctions against Iraq are ``extremely
effective'' and the West should refrain from any further military
build-up in the Persian Gulf.
   The Finnish host of the U.S.-Soviet summit made the remarks in
an interview published today in Finland's leading daily newspaper,
Helsingin Sanomat.
   ``In my view it seems that the sanctions are extremely
effective,'' Koivisto said.
   ``Those who like to believe that they aren't working are
yearning in the direction of taking other quick action,'' said
Koivisto, referring to military action.
   He said he objected to sending more military forces to the
region. ``It's possible that they could cause more confusion and
mix-up than usefulness ... when small ships sail to and fro over
there,'' Koivisto said.
   Koivisto was interviewed before he greeted Bush, the first to
arrive for Sunday's sudden summit. Bush warmly praised Finland for
standing ``with the forces of peace'' in backing the U.N. sanctions
against Iraq.
   Finland, a Security Council member, heads the U.N. committee on
sanctions against Iraq.
   Koivisto said there should be no deal with Iraq to secure the
hostages' release or anything else. He reiterated Finland's support
for the U.N. position that Iraq must release all the hostages and
withdraw from Kuwait unconditionally.
   ``One cannot always reconcile, and one shouldn't always (try to)
do so. There is a time and place for reconciliation,'' said
Koivisto, who in the past week has taken an unusual step for a
Finnish president by speaking out strongly against Iraq's policies.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has rejected a challenge from
Greenpeace USA and cleared the way for the Army to ship chemical
weapons from West Germany for destruction at a remote outpost in
the Pacific.
   Greenpeace sought a temporary restraining order, contending the
move and incineration at Johnston Atoll posed an environmental and
human threat.
   The Army already has begun moving the weapons from a storage
site at Clausen, West Germany, to Johnston Atoll, 800 miles
southwest of Honolulu.
   Government attorneys had said Johnston Atoll is the safest
location for the weapons. They said every precaution has been taken
to ensure the safety of the shipment to the new Johnston Atoll
Chemical Agent Disposal System, or JACADS.
   Greenpeace attorney Skip Spaulding contended the Army violated
the National Environmental Policy Act by not filing an
environmental impact statement covering the movement of the weapons
within West Germany.
   The Army said it prepared such a statement on the ocean portion
of the weapons' journey to Johnston. That report was classified.
   President Bush had assured the West German government the
weapons would be removed by the end of the year. Congress required
all U.S. chemical weapons be destroyed by 1997.
   The disposal facility at Johnston resembles a factory or power
plant. It covers several acres on the coral atoll that is barely
large enough to accommodate its airport.

   The 50 contestants in the Miss
America Pageant got a brief respite from hours of rehearsals while
attention focused on the return of Bert Parks.
   Parks, who looked tanned and fit, was restored to grace Friday.
   ``I feel that this could be a vindication,'' the 75-year-old
Parks told reporters.
   Pageant officials axed Parks in 1980, saying he was too old to
keep up with the pageant's new image. The firing set off a
nationwide letter-writing campaign and Parks said it catapulted his
career.
   Tonight, Parks was to serenade former Miss Americas with his
trademark ``There She Is.'' Co-host Gary Collins was to sing the
song to the newly crowned Miss America.
   At a news conference, Parks sang the first few words of ``There
She Is,'' but said America would have to wait until the finals to
hear the rest.
   To commemorate the crooner's return, Parks was named grand
marshal of Friday night's Miss America parade on the Boardwalk. The
city renamed Park Place to ``Bert Parks Place'' for the weekend.
   Fans of Parks attracted by a throng of reporters came to watch
the unveiling of the green and white street sign one block off the
Boardwalk.
   ``If you're not singing, I'm not watching,'' one woman shouted.
   Parks blew kisses and mugged for photographers as he led the
waving contestants, floats, cars and marching bands down the
four-mile parade route.
   In a pageant tradition, the contestants, perched atop
convertibles, revealed their legs to cheering spectators who
screamed: ``Show us your shoes.'' Miss Hawaii Cheryl Akemi Toma
didn't raise her legs, but held up a beach thong to the cheering
crowd.
   Fans shouted ``Welcome back'' and ``Glad to have you back'' as
Parks passed by. Only a group of Vietnam veterans carrying American
flags drew more applause.
   The 50 Miss America hopefuls are divided into three groups,
competing in talent, swimsuit and evening gown divisions on three
successive nights to qualify for the finals.
   Thursday was the last of three preliminary competitions in the
events. The winner of the evening gown competition is kept secret
to heighten the suspense for the finals.
   Miss Texas Suzanne Lawrence won the first talent competition and
Miss Colorado Karrie Mitchell the first swimsuit competition in the
Tuesday night preliminary.
   Miss North Carolina Scarlet Morgan won the second talent
competition and Miss Florida Dana Rinehart Dalton won the second
swimsuit competition in the Wednesday night preliminary.
   Miss Illinois Marjorie Judith Vincent won the last talent
competition and Miss Mississippi Beth Howell the last swimsuit
competitions in the Thursday night preliminaries.

   A suspect in the slaying of five
college students told police he knew who killed two of the victims
and provided a name believed to be one of his multiple
personalities, a newspaper reported today.
   The Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville cited sources it did not
identify in today's story about Edward Lewis Humphrey.
   According to another newspaper report, Humphrey's statements to
police may be challenged because prosecutors stretched the law to
keep defense attorneys away from him after he was arrested Aug. 30
in an attack on his grandmother.
   Humphrey, 18, has not been charged in the slayings.
   Humphrey is one of eight suspects in the killings by a man
police said preyed on petite brunettes. One of four women slain was
decapitated and three of the bodies were mutilated. The victims
included one man.
   Humphrey said he knew who killed the first two, Christina
Powell, 17, and Sonja Larson, 18, the Jackonsville newspaper said.
   The Times-Union did not print the name Humphrey used, but during
a bond hearing Thursday, a jail guard testified Humphrey referred
to himself as ``John'' and exhibited bizarre behavior.
   Humphrey's lawyer, public defender J.R. Russo, said he was
unaware of any such statements by his client.
   ``It's news to me,'' he told The Associated Press. But Russo
noted that police had grilled his client without attorneys present.
   ``They also questioned him before we were appointed to the
case,'' he said.
   Authorities have refused to discuss publicly what Humphrey has
said.
   Russo said he believes investigators and prosecutors manipulated
the system to deny Humphrey the benefit of a lawyer soon after his
arrest.
   A judge could rule inadmissible any evidence gathered that
afternoon, which could include vital statements about Humphrey's
last week in Gainesville, he said.
   Despite an intense focus on Humphrey, a University of Florida
freshman, investigators elsewhere in the Southeast checked unsolved
stabbing deaths of other young women for similarities.
   Police cautioned Friday that they don't expect immediate results.
   Investigators provided no details about what they gathered in
searches of Humphrey's Gainesville apartment, car and his
grandmother's home in Indialantic, a coastal city about 180 miles
southeast of Gainesville.
   ``We did not leave empty-handed,'' Darnell said.
   Agents also obtained a personal search warrant for Humphrey that
could yield evidence on bodily fluids, fingerprints and hair.
   The Times-Union reported investigators found pubic hairs
resembling Humphrey's, but said the hairs were not conclusive
evidence.
   New charges of aggravated assault were filed against Humphrey as
a result of a confrontation the night before the first two bodies
were discovered.
   Students Greg Herskowitz and Rob Lipvak, both 18, claim Humphrey
threatened them with a knife at the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity house
Aug. 25.
   Humphrey also faces charges in Indian River County of armed
burglary and attempted sexual battery two years ago.
   Police disclosed for the first time Friday that Manuel Taboada,
the only man killed by the serial slayer, was asleep in bed when he
was slain.
   ``He was apparently surprised by his attacker,'' Ms. Darnell
said.

   A woman who apparently contracted
AIDS during a tooth extraction says her dentist's death from the
disease will not stop her plans to file a lawsuit.
   Kimberly Bergalis spoke out Friday for the first time and
pleaded for tighter controls on the health care industry.
   The national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta reported in
July that the case marked the first time a health professional had
passed AIDS to a patient.
   ``I had a lot of crazy thoughts, like maybe I was at the beach
and I stepped on a hypodermic needle,'' Ms. Bergalis said. ``You
just go insane with thought.''
   The 22-year-old woman from Fort Pierce said she plans to sue the
estate of the dentist, David J. Acer of Stuart, and her insurance
company.
   ``If I can protect other people from what happened to me, then I
have to do it,'' Ms. Bergalis said.
   Documents filed in state court in Palm Beach described her as
being in the advanced stages of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome. Her wisdom teeth were pulled by Acer in 1987.
   Acer died Monday, but his death was not made public by his
family until Friday.
   Investigators from the Centers for Disease Control interviewed
Ms. Bergalis three times to determine where she contracted the
disease.
   ``When I was visited by the CDC we kept going over certain
things,'' she said. ``I said, `What about the dentist?' because
there was a rumor at the time that he had AIDS. They said they were
not investigating that. I never heard from them again.''
   CDC officials in Atlanta refused to comment, citing
confidentiality rules.
   The family of Acer, 40, decided not to immediately disclose his
death so relatives could ``privately grieve,'' said lawyer Deborah
Sawyer.
   On Tuesday, the state Health Department released a letter dated
Aug. 31 that Acer wrote to former patients urging them to be tested
for AIDS.
   Acer said in the letter that he had followed CDC safety
guidelines, including consulting his doctor before continuing his
practice and wearing gloves and a mask while treating patients.
   He said he doubted he was the source of Ms. Bergalis' infection.
   ``I am a gentle man, and I would never intentionally expose
anyone to this disease,'' he wrote.
   The letter did not say how long Acer practiced after being
diagnosed with AIDS.
   Ms. Bergalis' lawyer, Robert Montgomery, said he planned to sue
Acer's estate and CIGNA Dental Health of Florida on Ms. Bergalis'
behalf. He did not say when the lawsuit would be filed.
   CIGNA referred Ms. Bergalis to Acer, who treated about 370
patients belonging to the dental plan.
   Ms. Bergalis said she was stunned when she was told in December
1989 that she was HIV positive, which meant she had been exposed to
the virus. The illness forced her to withdraw at the time from the
University of Florida.
   Her legal consultant, cardiologist Dr. Sanford Kuvin, said she
had no known risk factors.
   ``There weren't any other areas of my life that could have
exposed me to this as far as dating and friends,'' Ms. Bergalis
said. ``I was in shock. I was in deep shock.''

   Mother Teresa, the frail and aging Nobel
Peace Prize winner, gave up her retirement plans today when nuns
from around the world re-elected her to head their order, a church
official said.
   ``If this is God's will, I will serve in the capacity in the
best way possible,'' the 80-year-old nun was quoted by Monsignor
Francis Gomes as saying. He supervised the election.
   The Vatican gave its blessing and approval today to keeping
Mother Teresa as head of the order she founded in the late 1940s.
   In March, Pope John Paul II bowed to Mother Teresa's wish to
retire and accepted her resignation. He had rejected her earlier
requests to step aside, even though she pleaded old age and ill
health.
   The ballots were cast by 103 delegates representing the
Missionaries of Charity around the world. The vote came after eight
days of religious instruction, reflection and devotions conducted
behind the walls of the Kennedy Center, a home for retarded women
and children near Calcutta's Dum Dum Airport.
   The nun, known as the ``saint of the gutters'' for her work with
the destitute and dying, suffered a nearly fatal heart attack a
year ago.
   Sister Priscilla Lewis, spokeswoman for the order, said Mother
Teresa's agreement to stay on was ``greeted with great joy and
clapping.''
   Gomes, who announced the result after a three-hour meeting, said
the nuns felt that ``with so much opening up in the Western world
and in the Eastern Europe they need someone who can face the
challenges.''
   Until the balloting outcome was announced, Mother Teresa had not
changed her mind about stepping down, Gomes said.
   After the result was announced, Gomes walked to the center's
front gate to give the news to a small group of reporters.
   Mother Teresa's re-election settles, for the moment, one of the
biggest questions facing the Missionaries of Charity: who besides
Mother Teresa has the worldwide recognition, coupled with the
indefatigable determination and charisma, to open the political and
financial doors needed to accomplish their work?
   At the height of the Israeli siege of West Beirut in 1982, she
walked between the guns of the Israeli army and the Palestine
Liberation Organization to rescue children trapped without food and
medicine in a front-line hospital. The shooting stopped until her
rescue mission was completed.
   Pulling herself from her sickbed only a few months after
suffering a heart attack in September 1989, Mother Teresa headed
for Moscow and Eastern Europe to open new missions.
   Her ministry to the poor and helpless began in earnest 43 years
ago in the gutters of Calcutta. She gave up a comfortable teaching
job at a Roman Catholic school to succor those whom no one else
would touch.
   Rescuing dying people from the streets of the teeming
metropolis, Mother Teresa went on to found a series of homes in
Calcutta and eventually throughout the world for society's
castaways.
   Today, the Missionaries of Charity operate 430 homes in 95
countries for lepers, cripples, abandoned babies and others with no
place to turn. The order has about 3,000 nuns.
   She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.
   Mother Teresa was born in Skopje, Yugoslavia, daughter of an
Albanian contractor.

   An Illinois company is putting the Clark candy
line up for sale and shutting down a plant it opened five years ago
with help from $4.9 million in low-interest loans.
   Leaf Inc. made Clark and Zagnut candy bars at the plant.
Production of the Zagnut will be moved to a Centralia, Ill.,
factory, company officials said Friday.
   The plant closing in suburban Pittsburgh by late 1991 will idle
170 workers.
   Clark is going up for sale after marketing efforts and capital
investment failed to make the candy ``a national brand,'' said Jim
Grubiak, Leaf's senior vice president.
   ``Unfortunately, Clark just didn't make the cut,'' he said.
   Five years ago, Allegheny County and its Industrial Development
Authority persuaded Leaf to open the plant to replace an old one
and arranged for the low-interest loans.
   The old plant, in Pittsburgh, was shut down.

   President Bush created a friendly
frenzy with an impromptu stop today in a Finnish marketplace where
he strolled out of his armored limousine and shook hands with the
crowd.
   Bush, the first to arrive for Sunday's superpower summit with
Mikhail Gorbachev, said he just wanted to say ``hello'' to a few
people and ``then I've got to get to work.''
   As helicopters whirled above his motorcade, the friendly Finns
shoved to get a better view of the 6-foot-2 American president.
Some clambered atop chairs and stall tables.
   The scene unfolded in a vegetable and fish market in front of
the Presidential Palace, where Sunday's summit with the Soviet
leader will unfold.
   ``It's great they've come here,'' said a teenage girl named
Sari, balancing against her two school friends on a market bench.
   Preparations in the Finnish capital have been frantic since last
weekend when Bush and Gorbachev announced their snap summit to
discuss the gulf crisis and other issues.
   A Royal Danish Orchestra concert got bumped from Finlandia Hall,
commandeered as an international press center for the 3,000
journalists covering the summit. Gorbachev and Bush planned to hold
a joint news conference there Sunday evening.
   Streets were barricaded, tram stops were shifted and shopkeepers
moved in to cash in on the foreigners pouring in for the weekend,
including 750 American and Soviet officials.
   Shops, usually closed on Sundays, were given special special
permission to open on the sabbath.
   More than 20 large blue buses were parked across city streets to
block traffic around the palace ``and act as cover,'' said a
security policeman. Paramilitary snipers perched on the rooftop
across from the palace and scanned the waterfront with binoculars.
   Police blocked off the entire Katajanokka peninsula, a
residential area where a prison and harbor facilities are located.
   Ferries to Sweden were delayed because passengers would have to
drive past the Presidential Palace while Gorbachev was having
dinner with President Mauno Koivisto.
   T-shirts with pictures of Bush and Gorbachev above the face of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were fetching $20.
   Above Saddam's picture were the words: ``I love babies and
cemicals'' (sic). Underneath the two superpower leaders were the
words, ``Peace of world in Helsinki.''
   ``Of course, it's great that the presidents are coming,'' said
Merja, a schoolgirl out watching the city get ready. ``After all,
we here in the north are so cut off from the rest of the world that
it will be good that we can be at the center of world attention for
a short while.''
   Businesses expect the journalists alone to spend about 2 million
marks every day _ about $270 each _ during their speedy stay.
   But Matti Kohva from the Finnfacts Institute said Finns could
make more than money.
   ``Above all, Finnish businessmen will benefit from the fact that
Helsinki's name will be seen abroad,'' Kohva said.
   ``The (summit) participants will pay for their own expenses,''
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Petri Tuomi-Nikula. ``All we have
to do is to cover the cost of the extra arrangements.''
   That, he said, could come to about $1 million.
   The foreign ministry hired all-black limousines and all-black
taxis to ferry visitors and police were called off vacation and
weekend leave.

   India and Sri Lanka today intensified
efforts to bring their citizens home from Jordan, but tens of
thousands of Asian and Arab refugees from Iraq and Kuwait remained
stranded.
   A Jordanian border official said 225,000 Egyptians were stranded
in a huge camp just inside the Iraqi border. He said Jordan was
withholding permission for them to cross because of the
overcrowding at refugees camps.
   Jordan's meager resources are inadequate to provide food,
shelter and transportation for the 100,000 refugees stranded in
camps along its desert border. The flood of evacuees began five
weeks ago following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   An airlift operation for the Indians got under way today as a
planeload of refugees from Amman, Jordan, landed in Dubai. They
were to be flown back to India aboard Indian Air Force Ilyushin 76
transports.
   Indian Air Force planes have not been given permission to fly
directly to Amman, but Dubai is allowing them to use its
international airport as a transit point to Bombay. The new
operation will allow India to take refugees from Amman at a much
faster pace than over the past week.
   In Sri Lanka, officials are appealing for food donations for Sri
Lankan refugees in Jordan. The food will be flown to Amman on
passenger jets that are now returning home empty after refugee
airlifts, a Royal Jordanian Airline official in Colombo said.
   The 185-seat Airbus jets, chartered by the International
Organization for Migration, have been arriving at a rate of one or
two a day for the past week, the airline official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Relief officials have warned of unsanitary conditions at the
makeshift desert camps, and on Friday one said the refugee problem
could turn into a disaster.
   The government and aid workers have appealed for international
help to feed and transport home the evacuees from Iraq and Kuwait _
many of whom left all their possessions and money behind. They fled
after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and subsequent annexation of its
oil-rich neighbor.
   But on Friday, a shipment of four tons of canned beef from the
Netherlands was sent to laboratories for testing after tons of
cookies, powdered milk and dates sent to hungry refugees were
deemed unfit for human consumption.
   The worthless food was only the latest problem confronting
international aid workers trying to ease the misery of 45,000 Asian
refugees packed into the Shaalan I camp near the Ruweishid border
post.
   The Jordanian border official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the stranded Egyptians ``are waiting under terrible
conditions for permission to cross into Jordan to continue their
journey home.''
   ``But we cannot cope with such huge numbers before the Asian
evacuees already inside Jordan waiting for transportation to their
homes are shifted,'' he said.
   He said 18,325 evacuees crossed through the border post on
Friday.
   James N. Purcell, director of the International Organization for
Migration, appealed for ships and aircraft to repatriate Asians in
hot and dirty camps ``before human suffering becomes a human
tragedy.''
   Fights have broken out at the Shaalan I camp, where refugees
scramble and jostle under hot sun for a meager daily ration of a
piece of bread, a tomato and a cucumber provided by the government.
Little outside aid has reached them.
   Red Cross officials and others say some refugees have gone for
up to three days with little water, food or shelter.
   Most of the refugees at the Shaalan I camp are Bangladeshi,
Pakistani, Indian and Sri Lankan men. Many of the women and
children are being sent to refugee camps in Amman.
   At a tent hospital set up by the Red Cross-Red Crescent, Dr.
Khaled Issa said 2,000 people a day come in for treatment. Most
suffer dehydration, colds and other minor illnesses. But in the
harsh camp conditions, minor ailments can rapidly become
life-threatening.
   Issa said those who are sick should drink five gallons of water
a day, much more than is available.
   A five-member delegation from the European Parliament toured
Jordan's camps and members said Friday they were appalled by the
conditions. One said European nations should provide military
transport planes to airlift the refugees home.
   Official estimates say more than 250,000 foreigners, mostly
Asians, have crossed the desert border post at Reweishid since the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
   A legislative task force has failed to reconcile
fully the economic plans of President Mikhail Gorbachev with the
more radical proposals of rival Boris Yeltsin, a top official said
today.
   The task force on economic reform, which was under orders to
come up with an economic blueprint before Monday's opening session
of the national parliament, agreed Friday night on what it called a
``unified plan.''
   However, Anatoly Lukyanov, chairman of the national Supreme
Soviet legislature, said at a news conference that the task force's
plan would leave some major points of disagreement for national and
republic parliaments to tackle.
   Lukyanov did not specify the areas of disagreement. But on
Tuesday, Gorbachev spokesman Vitaly N. Ignatenko said they centered
on the speed and sequence of the reforms and on price-setting
machinery.
   Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, had threatened
that the Russian republic would go ahead with radical economic
reform on its own if Gorbachev and national authorities continued
to delay.
   Since Russia is the largest Soviet republic, with half the
country's people and three-quarters of its land, the Kremlin could
hardly ignore Yeltsin's warning.
   Lukyanov said the national legislature will not act on the
economic plans until it has been discussed in each of the 15
republican parliaments.
   Russia's Supreme Soviet is to debate its radical version
starting Monday and may adopt it Tuesday.
   The plan calls for transformation of the Soviet Union to an
economic union with a single currency and one customs code, but no
central authority to levy taxes. The Russian republic would
immediately legalize private ownership of land.
   Lukyanov also said 13 bills on economic reform have already been
sent to parliamentary committees for review. He said they including
draft laws on protection of individual property and inventions,
pricing, entrepreneurship, banking, use of foreign currency,
employment, customs, social security, insurance, foreign investment
and support for invalids and other disadvantaged groups.
   Other bills on the Supreme Soviet agenda for the upcoming
session include one guaranteeing freedom to emigrate and travel.
The United States has refused to grant the Soviet Union
preferential trade treatment until this law is approved.
   Freedom of religion and a law on creation of public
organizations and political parties also will be considered,
Lukyanov said.

   Sweden and Norway evacuated their
embassies in Kuwait today but officially left them open in defiance
of Iraqi authorities, Swedish and Norwegian officials said.
   Surrounded by Iraqi troops, Norway's embassy has been without
water, electricity and communications for nearly two weeks. Similar
conditions prevail at the Swedish mission.
   Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bjoern Blokhus said three
Norwegian diplomats, two Swedes and and local employees were en
route to Baghdad and expected to arrive Sunday.
   ``We received word through the Danish Foreign Ministry that they
had left,'' Blokhus said. ``We feel reasonably certain that the
trip will go well.''
   He said Norway still does not accept the Iraqi order to
permanently close its mission. Sweden took the same position.
   ``Principally, we maintain our right to keep our embassy in
Kuwait,'' Swedish Foreign Ministry spokesman Ulf Heineback told the
Stockholm newspaper Dagens Nyheter.
   The diplomats were guaranteed safe passage to Baghdad, but their
eventual departure from Iraq would ``be the subject of future
negotiations,'' Blokhus said. He said the Iraqis no longer consider
the Kuwait embassy staff as diplomats.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and then annexed the oil-rich
emirate, claiming it as part of Iraqi territory. Baghdad on Aug. 24
ordered all missions in Kuwait closed, turning off utilities and
surrounding embassies with troops.
   The U.S. Embassy is among about 30 missions in Kuwait that
refused to close, although the staff was reduced.
   Several nations _ including the Soviet Union, Japan and Hungary
_ withdrew their staffs earlier but maintained the embassies are
not officially closed.
   Iraq has told diplomats accredited to Kuwait that they have lost
their diplomatic immunity. Baghdad has blocked personnel who left
the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait from returning home until the mission is
closed.
   There were about 21,000 Westerners in Iraq and Kuwait at the
time of Iraq's invasion, including 3,000 Americans. Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein has allowed some Western women and children to leave
over the last week.
   Western men, however, have been prevented from leaving. Many
were placed at strategic Iraqi installations to deter any attack by
U.S.-led multinational forces.

   Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy issued executive orders to
slash the state work force and cut state salaries as she defied
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis while he was out of town.
   With Dukakis leading a trade mission in Germany, Murphy lived up
to her promise to take command and try to balance the state deficit.
   ``What I have put in motion today is what I have been talking
about for some time _ nothing radical, nothing irresponsible,''
Murphy said Friday. ``I'm an economist and a public servant, not a
revolutionary.''
   Acting under provisions making her acting governor in Dukakis'
absence, Murphy issued executive orders that would cut the state
work force by an estimated 1,000 jobs and cut salaries for some
employees. She acknowledged, however, that Dukakis can undo her
work when he returns Friday.
   Dukakis had said he might cut his trip short if any action
Murphy took threatened to hurt the state's stability. But after
Murphy issued her orders, Dukakis spokesman Stephen Crawford said
he saw no reason for the governor to return early.
   He noted that executive orders requiring payroll cuts would not
take effect before Dukakis comes back, since such actions take 10
days to implement.
   In her announcement Friday, Murphy also requested state agencies
to cut their 1992 budgets 10 percent below spending levels for the
current fiscal year, and unveiled plans to set up a commission to
investigate inaccurate revenue estimates, which have been blamed
for exacerbating the budget problems.
   Murphy, who is running for governor in the Sept. 18 Democratic
primary, touched off a power struggle in the Statehouse after she
said Wednesday that she was waiting for Dukakis to leave so she
could enact her plans to deal with the state's fiscal crunch.
   Learning about the revolt, Dukakis postponed his travel plans,
bitterly attacking Murphy's maneuver as a ``charade.'' But he
eventually left for Germany on Thursday night.
   Critics called Murphy's efforts a political stunt that
ultimately would have about as much chance of success as her
flagging campaign for governor. Opinion polls put her behind two
other candidates for governor in the primary race.
   ``I don't take coffee house coup d'etats very seriously,'' said
one of her Democratic primary rivals, Boston University President
John Silber.
   L. Edward Lashman, the governor's secretary of administration
and finance, said that the projected savings in Murphy's plan were
highly inflated, though he called the proposal a ``serious effort.''
   Along with many Democrats, Murphy was an avid Dukakis supporter
during his 1988 bid for the presidency. But the state's fiscal woes
have made Dukakis the source of public disdain, including snipes
from Murphy.
   Murphy insisted she was trying to save the state from sinking
further in its fiscal mess.
   ``As I look back, maybe I should have acted in the past,'' she
said. ``I don't deny that.''
   Included in Murphy's executive orders:
   _Cut the management positions under each Cabinet secretary by 25
percent by Dec. 31.
   _Restructure the state Department of Administration and Finance,

   Finance ministers of the 12-member European
Community today discussed plans for economic and monetary union and
assessed the impact of the Persian Gulf crisis on Europe's economy.
   On Friday, EC foreign ministers agreed to give $2 billion in
economic aid to Turkey, Jordan and Egypt to compensate them for
lost trade with Iraq. The United Nations has imposed an economic
embargo on Iraq for its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Officials said the finance ministers would discuss how the aid
will be financed. Italy holds the rotating presidency of the
European Community.
   The EC hopes the oil-rich Persian Gulf nations _ notably Saudi
Arabia which benefits from higher oil prices _ will pay $6 billion
of the estimated $9 billion Turkey, Jordan and Egypt will lose
through 1991.
   EC Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Henning
Christophersen will give the finance ministers an initial
assessment of the impact of the gulf crisis on the EC economy.
   He will not offer precise figures, officials said, but present
several scenarios, including one foreseeing oil prices hovering at
around $30 a barrel. At that price, the Community's economic growth
could drop to 2.1 percent from a forecast rate of 3.1 percent, and
there would be a reversal in the trend toward declining
unemployment, according to EC figures.
   Another key topic of today's meeting was plans to turn the
European Community into an economic and monetary union _ an issue
that has pitted Britain against its EC partners.
   In December, the 12 EC nations will hold a conference to amend
the Community's constitution, creating a European central bank and
a single currency.
   While there is agreement on the need to turn the EC into a more
effective trade bloc, there are disagreements on the need for a
single currency and central bank, both of which Britain opposes.
   The finance ministers today discussed a blueprint for economic
and monetary union that proposes a European central banking system,
called Eurofed, as early as Jan. 1, 1993, and a European currency
unit, the ecu, to become a single EC currency.
   Spain today proposed the EC not create a single currency until
at least 2000, but use the currency along with the 12 national
currencies for several years before the switch.
   Spanish Finance Minister Carlos Solchaga also recommended the EC
not establish Eurofed until after Jan. 1, 1994.
   The European Community members are: France, West Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland,
Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.

   An Arizona couple fulfilled a
dream of marrying in Tahiti, even though the bride lay immobilized
in a hospital bed during the ceremony because of a broken leg.
   Elizabeth Talbot fell off a terrace at a rented house three days
before the planned wedding, breaking her leg in two places. She and
her fiance, Douglas Michelson, applied for and finally received
permission to be married at the hospital.
   The mayor of Papeete, capital of the French territory,
dispatched a government official to conduct the ceremony Thursday
and later presented a commemorative plaque to the two Phoenix
residents.
   The event was front-page news Friday in local newspapers.

   Ten people were killed when their houses
were buried under landslides or swept away by floods during
torrential rains in western Nepal, the Home Ministry said Saturday.
   The deaths occurred Tuesday, but reports from the remote regions
were slow to reach the capital.
   Eight people were killed and four were injured when their homes
were swept away by floods in the Jajarkot district, 200 miles west
of Katmandu, the ministry's announcement said.
   The bodies of two children were found under a heap of rubble
after a landslide hit their house in the Rolpa district, 175 miles
west of the capital, the ministry said.
   In late August, 32 people died in floods that struck several
parts of this Himalayan nation.

   Masked gunmen tied up 29 Italian
vacationers and workers, then set off explosives that damaged two
bungalows at a tourist complex being built in southern Corsica,
police said Saturday.
   There was no claim of responsibility, but the attack was similar
to others claimed by guerrillas who seek Corsica's independence
from France and oppose continuing tourist development on the
Mediterranean island.
   Police said six or seven men entered the partially completed
complex at about 9:30 p.m. Friday, took 15 tourists and 14 workers
prisoner, and tied them up in a villa before setting off homemade
bombs made from gas bottles.
   Two bungalows and a construction crane were badly damaged by the
blasts, but no one was injured, police said. One of the attackers
left a spray-painted message, ``No Mafia,'' and the group then fled
in a stolen car, according to police.
   The seaside complex is being developed by an Italian company.

<HEAD>Seoul to Propose Exchange Visits of Separated Family Members</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon said
Saturday South Korea will propose that families separated on the
divided Korean peninsula be allowed to have temporary reunions.
   Kang said the exchanges could begin around Chusok, the Korean
thanksgiving day, which falls on Oct. 3. The holiday is widely
observed in both countries.
   It would be the second time that the hostile nations have
allowed separated families to visit with each other. The first
exchange took place in 1985 and involved only 50 people from each
side.
   There are about 10 million members of families separated by the
division of the peninsula in 1945. The border of North and South
Korea is sealed and there is no mail or other form of communication
between the nations.
   Kang said he was optimistic about the prospect of the exchanges,
citing an upbeat mood that prevailed at the just-concluded talks
between him and North Korean Prime Minister Yon Hyong Muk.
   The prime ministers' talks were the highest-level meetings
between the rival nations. They failed to produce any tangible
agreements but officials of both sides were upbeat and said they
will meet again in North Korea's capital in mid-October.
   The prime ministers' talks in Seoul could thaw the Cold War
relations between the two nations, Kang said.
   He said the manner in which the North Korean officials spoke and
acted bolstered belief that the communist regime may change its
policy and recognize South Korea as a legitimate entity.
   He cited the North Korean prime minister's meeting with South
Korean President Roh Tae-woo and his repeated reference to Roh as
``your excellency president.''
   During the Seoul talks, Kang said he proposed that South Korea
import iron ore and other raw materials from North Korea. Communist
officials did not respond directly.

   A renegade army captain surrendered

   Capt. Edmundo Malabanjot, a former officer of the Philippine

   Malabanjot in a signed statement released to reporters said he

lasted from Dec. 1-9, 1989.
   ``I am calling on our countrymen who continue to rebel against
the government to stop the violence to stop this senseless
bloodshed and work together for the welfare of the country,'' the
statement said.

attempt in an attempt to free jailed comrades.

<HEAD>Albania's Communist Leader Outlines New Election Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Voters in Albania will be given some
freedom of choice, but the ruling Communists will maintain tight
control over the election process, that country's leader said.
   In comments made available today, Communist Party leader Ramiz
Alia also hinted that wide-ranging changes may be necessary to
accelerate new economic programs.
   ``Without combatting red tape, without being freed from the old
management complexes ... the hindrances we are coming across cannot
be eliminated,'' said Alia in a speech Thursday to legislators and
senior officials of organizations supervised by the ruling
Communist Party. The state ATA news agency distributed Alia's
comments today.
   Albania in recent months has sought to usher in modest reforms
and shed its image as a hermit country and Europe's last bastion of
hard-line Stalinism.
   Diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union were re-established.
Albania is also seeking to resume full relations with the United
States while moving closer to other European nations.
   The Albanian leadership has announced economic reforms
calculated to nudge the country away from rigid central planning
and give private farmers and tradesmen greater freedoms.
   Last month, it liberalized travel regulations, allowing all
citizens to own a passport and abolishing the death penalty for
those trying to flee the country. Authorities later allowed the
departure of about 5,000 asylum-seekers who had poured into foreign
embassies in the capital city of Tirana.
   Alia, however, has said he will not allow sweeping democratic
change and full multiparty elections.
   Outlining the planned election legislation, Alia said it would
give all citizens the right to stand for office except those
``expressly deprived of this right by law.'' He did not elaborate
on who would be prohibited.
   Balloting would be secret and there would be two nominees for
each precinct. The right to nominate candidates would be granted to
the party, trade trade unions and other groups, Alia said.
   But the party controls all public organizations in Albania, and
it is unlikely the elections could pose a political threat to the
current rulers.
   Alia said broadening the nominating base ``will represent and
express better the will and convictions of all categories of the
population.''

<TEXT>
   NASA was counting on a successful
shuttle flight this month to help shake a tarnished image and prove
to Congress that it is, indeed, the can-do agency of years past.
   But the glory days seem further away than ever now that Columbia
still leaks hydrogen and remains earthbound for another week,
possibly longer. It's one more embarrassment for NASA as lawmakers
head into the final weeks of budget talks.
   President Bush has proposed spending $15.1 billion for NASA for
fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. That's 24 percent more than this
year's $12.3 billion budget.
   The space agency's administrator, former astronaut Richard
Truly, said he hopes _ and trusts _ Congress will support the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration as it has before.
   ``I'm going to continue to tell them what I've been telling
them, that is to remind them that we're executing the program that
we put into place after the Challenger accident,'' Truly said. ``We
said that when we ran into safety problems like hydrogen leaks,
which can be extremely dangerous, we were going to stop and fix
them.''
   ``We've been sticking to our guns and doing what we agreed with
their oversight to do,'' Truly said last week.
   NASA's third attempt to send Columbia on an astronomy mission
ended abruptly Thursday when hydrogen leaked during fueling. A fuel
leak also occurred during Columbia's first launch attempt in May.
   Shuttle Atlantis also was found to have hydrogen leaks. That
discovery prompted NASA in late June to temporarily ground the
three-shuttle fleet.
   Forrest S. McCartney, director of Kennedy Space Center, said
there is no reason for NASA to be ``hanging its head'' over the
leak-related launch delays.
   ``Hey, this isn't easy work. This is not the routine, everyday
work,'' McCartney said. ``The thing we want to do is make sure
every time we fly, we fly safely. Hopefully, America will
understand that.''
   One of the chief criticisms leveled against NASA after the 1986
Challenger disaster was that it was taking risks to meet an
overambitious schedule. That year, NASA had scheduled 15 shuttle
flights.
   In the two years since flights have resumed, 10 shuttles have
been launched. Nine missions had been scheduled for 1990; three
have flown.
   Discovery was the last shuttle to fly. The April mission
successfully placed the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit _ but then
a flaw in the instrument's mirror was discovered in June.
   Nothing, it seems, has gone right for NASA since spring. In
addition to leaky shuttles and Hubble's trouble, the space agency
has encountered mounting criticism of its space station plans and
communications problems with the Magellan spacecraft orbiting Venus.
   A Senate appropriations committee will be taking all of NASA's
problems into account when it sets the 1991 budget. Deep cuts are
expected.
   The House already has slashed more than $800 million. The
House's $14.3 billion plan still is 17 percent more than the
current budget.
   About $195 million was cut from the $2.45 billion sought for the
proposed space station Freedom. The House also cut more than $300
million in work to begin on Bush's plan to send astronauts back to
the moon and on to Mars.
   ``NASA has more than enough on its plate at the moment and ought
not to be starting new programs,'' said Rep. William Green, R-N.Y.,
vice chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds
NASA.
   Green said no one faults NASA for scrubbing launches because of
leaking hydrogen, a highly combustible fuel. But, he said, the
problem demonstrates ``how fragile the shuttle is and raises the
question whether space station is way oversized in terms of the
capability of the shuttle to get it built and serviced.''
   Engineers suspect a bad fuel pump is the source of Columbia's
latest leaks. Workers planned Sunday to replace all three
recirculation pumps, one for each main engine.
   NASA is aiming for a Columbia launch for early the week of Sept.
17, which would provide enough time before Discovery's top-priority
mission in October.
   Discovery's cargo is a satellite named Ulysses that will be sent
on a five-year journey to study the sun's unexplored polar regions.
NASA must launch Discovery between Oct. 5 and Oct. 23, or it will
have to wait until the planets are properly aligned again in late
1991.

   The ban on women serving as nurses
will be lifted Monday, which would have been unthinkable in this
strict Moslem kingdom before Saddam Hussein's army invaded
neighboring Kuwait a month ago.
   The announcement last week was an indication of the social and
political change that began after King Fahd drastically altered
Saudi policy and invited hundreds of thousands of foreign soldiers,
mostly Americans, to defend his throne.
   Saudi, diplomatic and other sources said the crisis will
accelerate a discreet move toward liberalization that has been
creeping through the kingdom for a decade.
   Some of the changes wrought by the U.S. intervention may not
last, but Saudi society appears on the threshold of modernization.
   ``The crisis will have a lot of impact,'' said Prince Abdallah
bin Faisal, head of one of the country's major industrial
developments and a nephew of the king. ``It will speed up certain
ideas that the government has been thinking about for years.''
   Expected changes include a more professional, broadly based
military, more freedom for women, greater press freedom, more
public say in local matters and a foreign policy of cementing
alliances.
   Fear of a backlash from the conservative Islamic faithful will
temper the pace.
   ``There's a feeling that society is still raw,'' said Omar S.
Bagour, an economics professor at King Abdul Aziz University. ``New
ideas should be delivered in specific doses so as not to offend the
religious people.''
   American servicemen and women pouring into Saudi Arabia are not
expected to have much direct influence on Saudi society because
most are stationed at desert bases. It is the first time foreigners
have been called in to defend the kingdom.
   In addition, a call for army volunteers represents a major
change in a force that had been reserved for princes and members of
the Bedouin tribes loyal to the ruling al-Saud family since the
country was united in the 1920s.
   ``They used to look for what was referred to as a `friendship of
arms,'' Bagour said. ``Now the door's been thrown wide open.''
   Billions of dollars in oil money engendered a false sense of
security in Saudi Arabia, and the spartan, desert warrior tradition
gave way to limousines and air conditioning.
   ``The Saudi government has pampered its citizens for years,
given them everything for free,'' said Khaled A. Al-Maeena, editor
of Arab News, the kingdom's leading English-language daily. ``It's
time for people to start doing things for themselves.''
   A few weeks ago, newspapers rarely carried anything that could
rock the boat. Now, they are becoming more open about Arab issues.
   In foreign policy, the kingdom is moving conspicuously away from
Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, but
diplomats said it was unlikely to abandon the Palestinian cause.
   Saudi Arabia and the other oil-rich Persian Gulf states have
paid Arafat's bills for years. The Saudis also have sought to
balance their ties with America and the Islamic world.
   With the Arab world turned upside down by Saddam, diplomats
said, the Saudis are expected to foster ties with Syria and Egypt
to rebuild a semblance of Arab unity.
   No one wanted to be quoted as speaking against the royal family,
a network of more than 4,000 princes, but businessmen are privately
critical of the growing number of princes who use their influence
to win government contracts.
   King Fahd is an absolute monarch. Like the neighboring emirates
and sheikdoms, Saudi Arabia has little democratic structure, but
that could be changing. One option is a consultative council. The
government built a headquarters for it in the 1980s, but did not
name a council or hold elections.
   Because of the small population, somewhere between 7 and 11
million in an area the size of Western Europe, policy changes could
increase opportunities for women.
   ``Conscription for men has historically opened a place for women
in jobs,'' said Faiza S. Ambah, a journalist.
   Women have been banned from nursing, for example, because it
involves mingling with male strangers, a violation of Islamic
tenets.
   ``Most of the nurses are Britons or Filipinos,'' said Samar
Fatany, a radio broadcaster. ``What happens if there's a war and
they all decide to go home?'' In a recent interview, the civil
defense director said women probably would be asked to help
ambulance and fire-fighting units.
   ``Before the crisis, this would have been blasphemy,'' one Arab
said.
   Many women hope for an end to laws against their driving, or
traveling without being escorted by a male relative.
   The sight of American servicewomen driving trucks or working
with their male colleagues in high-tech jobs may bolster their
argument.
   ``To rely on a 22-year-old girl to help defend the country could
break a barrier in their minds,'' said an ambassador from a Moslem
country.
   Saudis travel and study abroad, have access to foreign
television and radio and are host to 4 million expatriate workers,
among them 25,000 Americans, but none of that has changed the
kingdom's traditions or strict Islamic principles.
   Most Americans and Europeans live in their own complexes so
their customs, considered decadent by many Arabs, do not infect the
Saudis.
   Conservative Moslems, who distrust the United States because of
its close ties with Israel, supported the use of American troops to
defend the country.
   Bin Baz, a spokesman for the religious groups, issued a
statement saying it was permissible to have Christian soldiers
defend the center of Islam against an enemy like Saddam.
   Even moderate believers say this support would evaporate if U.S.
forces attack Moslem civilians in Kuwait or Iraq.
   ``The United States will have our support as long as they act
under moral rules,'' said Nezar Zahed, a lay preacher.
   Diplomats said the same rule applies to the Saudi government,
which is keenly aware that change must be synchronized with the
kingdom's Islamic past.
   ``Just because we buy neon light doesn't mean we have to have a
striptease with it as well,'' Prince Abdullah said.

<HEAD>Oregon Proposal Would Provide Tax Break for Private School Parents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES E. BEGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A petition drive has put a proposed
constitutional amendment on Oregon's Nov. 6 ballot that supporters
and foes alike call the most far-reaching school choice measure in
the nation.
   Backers of the Educational Choice Initiative, or Measure 11, say
it would greatly broaden educational opportunity by giving parents
the means to send their children to schools of their choice _
public or private.
   Opponents say it would severely weaken the public school system
and violate constitutionally required separation of church and
state.
   The proposal would allow parents to send their children across
district lines to any public school. State school aid would follow
the students.
   More controversially, it also would grant state income tax
credits of up to $2,500 a year for pupils at private schools,
including church-supported schools, and for children taught at home.
   A poll of 600 registered voters conducted in late August for The
Oregonian newspaper of Portland found 48 percent in favor of the
proposal, 47 percent opposed and 5 percent undecided. The margin of
error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
   Minnesota is the only state with statewide open enrollment for
public schools. It also is the only one that gives tax breaks to
parents of students who attend private schools, but the breaks
aren't so generous as in the Oregon measure.
   Minnesota permits taxpayers to deduct from taxable income up to
$1,000 in private school expenses. The Oregon measure would allow
tax credits _ a direct subtraction from taxes owed _ of up to
$2,500 a year.
   The Office of Legislative Counsel said Measure 11 is similar in
most respects to the Minnesota law, which was upheld by the U.S.
Supreme Court in 1984.
   If the Oregon measure is passed, it will take effect in the
1991-92 school year.
   The proposal ``is certainly the most extensive'' one of its
kind, said Sister Catherine McNamee, president of the National
Catholic Education Association in Washington. The association,
which represents 200,000 Roman Catholic educators, strongly backs
the proposal.
   The idea for Measure 11, however, largely came from Libertarian
Party adherents.
   ``What we're most concerned about is quality education for our
children,'' said Steve Buckstein, a Portland stockbroker. ``Where
it's performed is not as important as getting a good education.''
   Buckstein, an unsuccessful Libertarian candidate for state
treasurer in 1988, is a spokesman for Oregonians for Educational
Choice, which put the measure on the ballot with 127,000 petition
signatures.
   Opponents say one of their major arguments against passage will
be that the measure would result in using taxes to aid religion.
   ``I have a basic disagreement with public funds for private
schools,'' said Norma Paulus, the state school superintendent-elect.
   ``Their arguments for allowing choice inside the public school
system are very valid,'' she said. ``But if you lay the initiative
on top of the existing funding mechanism, it will hasten the
disintegration of the public school system.''
   The Oregon Education Association, the state's largest teachers
union, opposes the whole idea.
   ``We believe every school should be excellent,'' said the
union's president, Karen Famous. ``Competition implies winners and
losers, and none of our young children can be classified as
losers.''
   The union also would focus its attack on the church-state issue,
she said. Buckstein and other supporters say the church-state
argument is invalid.
   ``The state will never write a check to a religious school under
our measure,'' Buckstein said. ``And there is no entanglement
between the state and religion.''
   Supporters compare the tax credits to federal college-aid
benefits that can be used at public or private schools.
   A recurrent argument of the proposal's supporters is that it
would give low- and middle-income parents who now have no options
the opportunity to choose their children's schooling.
   ``Only the wealthy now have a choice in Oregon,'' Buckstein
said. ``Right now, geography is destiny. Where you can afford to
live determines where your child can go to school.''
   A study of the Minnesota system, which until this year applied
only to districts with more than 1,000 students, found less than
half of 1 percent of students transferred under open enrollment
last school year. Convenience was cited twice as often as academic
opportunity by those who volunteered reasons on their applications.

matter-of-factly of the terrorism he expects to run rampant if
America humiliates Saddam Hussein.
   ``If these colonial troops remain in our region, we will use any
means to get them out; kidnapping, terrorism _ any means,'' Jamal
Abu Saud said of the U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia.
   From former Cabinet ministers and millionaires to teen-agers who
sweep up at the outdoor markets, a majority of Jordanians support
the Iraqi leader and his demand for a tie between Kuwait's fate and
a homeland for the Palestinians.
   If he fails, a wide range of Palestinians and other Jordanians
agree, the United States will face deep-seated anger, radicalized
political and religious feelings and possibly violence. Of Jordan's
3 million people, 65 percent are Palestinians.
   Already, some Arabs in Jordan refer to the United States as
``the head of the snake,'' in the way Iranians began calling it the
``Great Satan,'' because it is seen as Israel's protector.
   Many Palestinians say opinion crystallizing around Saddam seems
to have unified their community to a degree rarely seen.
   ``I will explain,'' said John Hanna, a retired banker sipping
coffee under a rack of Arabic lutes, called rouds, at the Studio
Petra music shop. His friend, the shop owner, nodded gravely.
   ``As Arabs and Palestinians, we lost our land,'' Hanna said.
``We find this man who will give it back. If he gives us back our
rights, we will worship him. What else he does, we don't care.''
   With a low chuckle, he added that if King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
``put everything behind a Palestinian homeland, we would worship
him.''
   At his daughter's plush residence, Palestinian business mogul
Issa Masri parked his deluxe BMW beside his two other cars and took
his guests upstairs. There, a roomful of intellectuals chimed in.
   ``It's time American presidents understood that they must make
friends with people, not with kings and sheiks,'' said Wadid Masri,
an aging activist from Nablus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   ``Saddam fought for eight years to keep Iran out of Arabia,''
said Wahid Salah, a Palestinian lawyer and former Jordanian foreign
minister. ``The streets of Jordan are with Saddam.''
   King Hussein of Jordan shows sympathy for Saddam because his
people demand it, Salah said, just as Palestinians insist Yasser
Arafat orient the Palestine Liberation Organization toward Iraq.
   Salah stabbed a finger and added, ``If Saddam is defeated, this
whole area will be a zone of terrorism and anarchy. Every American
in the Arab world will be in danger.''
   Dr. Wiin Munib, a medical professor who has lectured at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore and Iowa University, criticized
Washington for not hearing out King Hussein.
   ``I feel bitter about America, maybe for the first time,'' he
said, adding that his own feelings were more moderate than most.
   On a less fashionable hill of Amman, among the winding alleys of
the old souk, or market, the mood is easy to read.
   At a butcher's stall, the familiar grinning portrait of Saddam
is taped up behind a hanging lamb carcass. Vegetable sellers and
keymakers display posters of the king and Saddam side by side.
   ``He's right,'' declared Ahmed Atthir, 18, leaning on a counter
of sunglasses and watches. ``I'll go fight if they need me.''
   Wealthier merchants are in accord.
   ``Saddam is a great man,'' said Emile Haddad, the Christian
owner of a menswear shop.
   In little towns the length of Jordan, at truck stops, in the
port city of Aqaba on the Red Sea, the word is the same.
   Complex feelings on the issue are not easy to judge. Salem
Fouad, a cabbie, keeps a photo of Saddam on his windshield and, in
the glove compartment, an invitation to his brother's wedding in
Nashville, Tenn.
   Opinion in Jordan is shifting against the United States. This is
most evident in the 11 camps where Palestinian refugees have waited
since 1948 to go home.
   The refugee camp of Wahdat blends almost imperceptibly into the
sprawl of downtown Amman, but its 120,000 residents know every inch
of its boundaries. Many refuse to leave, even when they earn the
means to move elsewhere, for fear of losing their Palestinian
identity or their right to demand a homeland.
   Abdul Aziz Attar, 70, was uprooted from Ramallah in the 1948
Israeli-Arab war. In 1967, when the Israelis captured the West Bank
of the Jordan River, he fled to Amman.
   He sits among balls of yarn and sequins in his shop and dreams
of a message like Saddam's.
   ``You have to know the enemy is America because it gives
everything to Israel,'' he said. ``We live like beggars so they can
have our wealth.''
   He drew a parallel with Kuwait, where he said a small group, the
now-deposed ruling al-Sabah family, squandered vast riches.
   As he spoke, a Jordanian policeman leaned close to listen. At
the mention of the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, he burst out: ``That
was Saddam's right. It is his.''
   Down the street a few blocks, a mother bringing her five
children home from shopping was asked about Saddam.
   ``We love him,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   To Soviets and foreign residents of
Moscow, Helsinki seems like one giant shopping mall. It's filled
with all the goods, from canned tomatoes to fine clothes to
videocassettes, that are unavailable at home.
   Children at Moscow's Anglo-American School, asked once for the
name of Finland's capital, answered, ``Stockmann's'' _ the name of
Helsinki's biggest department store.
   Catering to this image, the Finnish government said it would
allow retailers to remain open Sunday to accommodate the thousands
of free-spending foreigners in town for the summit between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Helsinki has long been a popular destination for shoppers from
the East, many of them expatriates living and working but finding
little to buy in Moscow.
   For diplomats, journalists, businessmen and students in Moscow,
Helsinki has the closest hospital they would feel comfortable
using, the closest English-language movie theaters, the closest
orthodontist, and until this year, the closest McDonald's.
   A cat owner in Moscow says she is considering sending her pet to
Helsinki to be spayed.
   Finnair's half-fare prices for three-day trips make the Finnish
capital a popular weekend destination for foreign families in
Moscow.
   To get by other times, they order lettuce, cheese, milk, car
parts, furniture, even all the fixings for a party, from
Stockmann's. The department store sends a goods train from Helsinki
to Moscow every Thursday.
   For clothes, some Muscovites travel to Helsinki to get the sizes
right, and a better choice of style and quality.
   But Stockmann's export service manager, Henry Blomqvist, said,
``One gentleman came in here once to order bras for his wife. His
wife was in Moscow and he was here, so he took a look at one of our
(sales) ladies and said, `You are the right size.'''
   Many Western residents of Moscow are asked to pick up a few
items for their Soviet friends. The most frequent requests are for
electronics goods, car parts and videocassettes. Anything with
Western brand names or symbols _ beer brand T-shirts, sandals with
foreign flag designs _ is gratefully received.
   For Soviet citizens who are able to save up precious foreign
currency and lucky enough to be sent to Helsinki on a business
trip, shopping in the West is an adventure.
   A Soviet sports team was buying ``ghetto-blasters'' _ powerful
portable radios _ at Helsinki's trendy ``Clockwork Orange''
electronics store during the past week.
   A Soviet employee of an American firm in Moscow was sent to
Helsinki to pick up a new company car. The driver was astounded
that different stores had different prices for the same items. He
had never heard of comparison shopping.
   Still, casual Soviet shoppers are uncommon in Helsinki, as
reflected by sales signs _ in Finnish, Swedish, and English, but
not Russian.
   Stockmann's glossy, multicolored catalogues are sold in the
Soviet Union, even though the items shown are available there only
in foreign currency stores. The magazine is a widely read
``dreambook.''
   Some Soviets occasionally fulfill their dream and make their way
to Stockmann's export department in Helsinki.
   ``They are short of money,'' Blomqvist says. ``That's the
problem. So they just buy the simplest things for normal use, cheap
clothes, usually. Soviets were not previously big customers for us.
We have only one salesperson who knows Russian well.
   ``But more of them are coming every week,'' he said.

   Here are President Bush's remarks
Saturday upon arriving for his summit meeting with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev:
   The city of Helsinki has often been a meeting place for nations
seeking to advance the cause of peace. My thanks to the people of
Finland first for hosting this meeting and for setting an example
for all the world in your resolute commitment to liberty and
independence.
   When President Gorbachev and I met in Washington, we discussed
the possibility of meetings such as the ones we'll hold here
tomorrow. We agreed that the United States and the Soviet Union had
reached a stage in our relations where meetings should occur more
frequently, less fanfare, working meetings, held as circumstances
might dictate. And our aim was that these meetings be unstructured
and informal, with an open agenda and a maximum opportunity to
exchange views on issues of mutual importance.
   In keeping with that aim, here in Helsinki President Gorbachev
and I will focus on a full range of issues.
   We seek continued movement towards the new Europe whole and
free. We seek to advance the pace of arms control, strategic and
conventional. And I want to hear about the progress of the Soviet
reform and explore other issues of interest to our two countries.
   And of course I expect that we will devote a large part of our
time together to the situation in the Persian Gulf.
   I've said many times this past year that we have entered a new
era in world affairs. This meeting comes at a critical time, at a
moment when the actions we take can shape this new world for years
to come.
   In the past many regional conflicts have played themselves out
against the background of the larger conflict of the Cold War.
Renegade regimes and unpredictable rulers resorted to force,
counting on superpower stalemate to frustrate a united response.
International law and international organizations were often
paralyzed, powerless to prevent conflict or restore the peace. But
the international response to Iraq's invasion proves how much has
changed.
   Here in Helsinki President Gorbachev and I meet, hopefully to
strengthen our common approach to this unjustifiable act of
aggression. Much is at stake and there is much the world stands to
gain if we succeed.
   If the nations of the world acting together continue, as they
have been, to isolate Iraq and deny Saddam the fruits of
aggression, we will set in place the cornerstone of an
international order more peaceful, stable and secure than any that
we have known.
   To our Finnish hosts, let met simply say that I intent to take
full advantage of this very brief but welcome opportunity to renew
America's warm friendship with Finland. I meet today with President
Koivisto whose counsel I have valued over the years. Barbara and I
often talk about our visit here in the early 80s, 1983. It was then
that I first met your president, President Koivisto. We've stayed
in very close touch since then, and I look forward to hearing his
views on the many issues that I've just mentioned and others as
well.
   Finland has long been a voice of peace and stability between
nations _ in the councils of the CSCE; as a member of the United
Nations peace-keeping forces; and today, at this time of challenge,
Finland once again stands with the forces of peace. I thank the
government of Finland for its staunch support as a member of the
United Nations Security Council upholding international law in the
face of Iraq's unwarranted aggression.
   Together with the nations of the world I am confident that we
can reverse the dangerous course of events brought on by the
actions of Saddam Hussein and restore peace, stability and respect
for the rule of law. Thank you, Mr. President, and may God bless
the people of Finland.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The superpower summit in Helsinki comes at a
critical juncture in U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms control negotiations,
described by some analysts as stalled and possibly in danger of
falling apart.
   Sunday's session between President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is not expected to provide more than a
symbolic push for arms control. The more immediate Persian Gulf
crisis is at the top of the summit agenda.
   The result may be a delay in the target date for completing a
long-range nuclear weapons treaty. At their Washington summit in
June, Bush and Gorbachev pledged to finish the Strategic Arms
Reduction Talks treaty _ already eight years in the making _ by the
end of the year.
   Doubt also is growing that the superpowers will complete a
separate treaty reducing conventional, or non-nuclear, arms in
Europe in time for a planned 35-nation summit in Paris in November.
Bush has said he will not attend the summit unless a Conventional
Forces in Europe, or CFE, treaty is finished beforehand.
   The Europeans are particularly anxious to see a CFE treaty
because it is closely linked to German reunification.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday
that Bush and Gorbachev will discuss CFE issues in Helsinki but
will not negotiate on the complex details.
   ``They will be attempting to add the impetus that would ensure
that agreement is ready to sign and that the summit can be held''
as planned in November, he said.
   The Persian Gulf crisis triggered by Iraq's invasion and
occupation of Kuwait is more than a distraction for the arms
control bureaucracies in Moscow and Washington. It also has raised
a new Soviet security concern: the sudden emergence of a huge U.S.
military force in the gulf area.
   Soviet Gen. Vladimir Lobov, the military chief of the Warsaw
Pact alliance, was quoted by the Soviet news agency Tass as saying
the American buildup in the gulf ``drastically changes the
strategic balance in the region.''
   Gorbachev is likely to seek reassurance from Bush in Helsinki
that the U.S. buildup will be reversed once the Iraq crisis ends,
said Steve Lilly-Weber, a defense specialist at the Institute for
Defense and Disarmament Studies in Brookline, Mass.
   Fitzwater insisted that START negotiations are on track, but
when asked whether Bush still expects to sign a completed treaty
this year he said only, ``Well, we're hopeful.''
   The START treaty would reduce each side's arsenal of long-range
nuclear missiles by about 30 percent. It would be the first-ever
negotiated cut in this category of arms.
   ``I think it eventually will be finished, but the timetable will
slip maybe into next year,'' said Stan Norris, an arms control
expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private research
organization.
   Others say the treaty negotiations could unravel completely if
Bush and Gorbachev allow the relatively few remaining disagreements
to fester much longer.
   Spurgeon M. Keeny Jr., president of the private Arms Control
Association and an advocate of a START treaty, said the rapid pace
of developments in the Middle East, plus fear of other post-Cold
War upheavals could kill support for the treaty.
   ``A treaty is a little bit like a shark; it has to keep moving
forward or it dies,'' he said.
   Three main issues are holding up completion of a START deal. One
is how far the Soviets should be allowed to go in modernizing their
SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles, which form the backbone
of the Soviet nuclear arsenal.
   The other unresolved matters are limits on the Soviet Backfire
bomber and Soviet efforts to set limits on U.S. transfers of
strategic nuclear systems to third countries.

   The Pawtuxet River flowed red through
Coventry and West Warwick last week.
   No, it wasn't blood red. About 3,000 pounds of a red powder dye
was dumped accidentally into a chemical manufacturer's sewage
treatment plant Wednesday. Friday, that powder found its way into
the Pawtuxet River and turned the water bright red.
   Department of Environmental Management authorities said the
Hoechst Celanese Corp. dye was water-soluble and non-toxic, so it
did not threaten the river or aquatic life.
   ``Although I understand it looks pretty horrible, it's
essentially an innocuous spill,'' said Fran Segerson, a department
spokeswoman.
   The department has recommended that Hoechst be fined for
violating its discharge permit, she said. The size of the fine had
not been determined.
   The dye got into the river because workers failed to bleach
waste water properly before it was released, said Carmen A. Avon,
environmental safety manager at the plant.
   She said the company considered adding bleach to the river to
clear up the color, but state environmental officials decided said
it would be better simply to let the dye dissipate on its own.

Continuing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said today it will halt charter
flights of foreigners to Jordan because of congestion, but a U.S.
official said the evacuation of foreigners would continue.
   Jordan denied crowding at its international airport was a
problem.
   Iraqi government spokesman Naji al-Hadithi said the order,
effective Sunday, would not stop any chartered flights today, which
were expected to include a planeload of Americans from Kuwait.
   He also said regular Iraqi Airways flights to Amman would not be
affected, and that charters to other destinations would be allowed.
   State Department officials said the latest group of Americans
was to be flown on today's chartered plane from Kuwait to Amman. A
U.S. Embassy spokesman in Amman said about 150 people were aboard.
A similar flight Friday carried 165 Americans and a few other
foreigners.
   Al-Hadithi, speaking to reporters, said the decision to stop
charter flights to Jordan was made after Jordanian officials
complained they could not handle the increased air traffic.
   But a spokesman for the Amman airport denied there was a problem
with congestion at the capital's international airport.
   ``Everything is fine, the airport is not crowded,'' said
Mashhour El-Kurashi. The foreigners arriving in the past week on
Iraqi Airways charters to Amman usually transfer immediately to
other planes for the journey to their home countries.
   Al-Hadithi himself suggested another motivation for the cutoff
when he noted that the short-haul charters to Amman, paid for by
the passengers' governments, were not particularly profitable.
   ``We are ready to take them (the planes) to any other capital or
city, even to the farthest point,'' the Iraqi official said.
   A State Department spokesman, told of the Iraqi announcement on
suspending charter flights to Amman, said: ``The evacuation will
continue.'' The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
a chartered flight will leave Baghdad on Sunday for London.
   ``We hope this will be the new model,'' the spokesman said. He
gave no further details on that flight.
   The Iraqi announcement came just as the air highway out of Iraq
via Jordan appeared to be running more smoothly. Exit visas were
being issued more quickly than at the start of the week, and Iraq
has allowed at least two direct charter flights from Kuwait City to
the Jordanian capital of Amman, with stopovers for visa formalities
in Baghdad.
   About a thousand stranded foreigners poured into Amman by air
from Kuwait and Iraq in the past week. Iraq had been allowing up to
three charter flights a day from Baghdad to Jordan.
   Al-Hadithi, the director-general of the Iraqi Information
Ministry, said airport officials in Jordan had complained that they
could not handle the hundreds of foreigners that have been pouring
into Amman for the past week.
   Since the exodus of foreign women and children from Iraq and
Kuwait began Sept. 1, the Amman airport has been the primary
transit point.
   Hundreds of women and children were in Baghdad awaiting exit
visas or flights. Thousands more foreigners remain trapped in Iraq
and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, stranded since the Aug. 2 invasion. Most
of those in Kuwait are in hiding.
   On Thursday, Iraq imposed a law mandating prison terms up to
life for foreigners caught trying to leave the country without exit
visas. The law also requires foreigners to report any change of
address within 48 hours or face jail.
   On Aug. 24, Iraq announced that anyone caught harboring a
foreigner would face charges of espionage, punishable by death.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Rejects Killer's Latest Bid To Block Execution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has rejected as
``frivolous'' the latest bid to block the execution of William
Andrews, the nation's longest standing death row inmate, for the
torture-murders of three people.
   In a three-page opinion released Friday, U.S. District Judge
David Sam said Andrews had been given ``every conceivable
opportunity'' for judicial review in more than 15 years of appeals.
   Andrews, 35, of Jonesboro, La., was convicted of the slayings in
1975. Pierre Dale Selby, who was convicted along with Andrews, was
executed by lethal injection in 1987.
   Both were enlisted men at Hill Air Force Base at the time of the
murders, in which five people were tied up, forced to drink liquid
drain cleaner and shot in the head. Two of the victims survived.
   Andrews' lawyers had filed a motion Aug. 13 asking Sam to
reconsider his earlier rejection of their motion for a new trial.
   The petition by Andrews, who is black, was based on claims that
the prosecution's rejection of a black potential juror violated his
constitutional right to equal protection under the law. The defense
also questioned whether Sam had seen certain files from earlier
court proceedings.
   The judge said the arguments regarding the juror and other
evidence purportedly uncovered from the sentencing phase of the
trial ``appear frivolous.''
   And he said the records cited were pertinent only to earlier
proceedings.
   Selby eventually confessed to firing the shots. Andrews' lawyers
have claimed he should have been convicted only of second-degree
murder because he did not fire the fatal bullets.
   Andrews' principal lawyer, Robert M. Anderson, was out of town
Friday and unavailable for comment. He has indicated that the case
would be appealed next to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

   Mother Teresa, saying she was bowing to
God's will, accepted re-election Saturday as head of her worldwide
mission for the poor after nuns ignored her wish to retire and
voted for her to remain.
   The vote was intended to choose a successor to Mother Teresa,
but after the results were announced the 80-year-old Nobel laureate
withdrew her decision to step down as superior general of the
Missionaries of Charity.
   ``She hasn't changed her mind, but she was elected,'' said
Monsignor Francis Gomes, who presided over the secret balloting.
``She hoped that someone else would be elected.''
   Gomes said Mother Teresa had little choice but to accept the
unanimous vote.
   ``In religious life, there is no personal desire. You have to
accept God's will,'' said Gomes, the vicar general of the Calcutta
diocese.
   The Vatican said in a statement that it approved and gave its
blessing to the decision. Mother Teresa declined to meet reporters,
pleading fatigue.
   After the vote she told the nuns, ``If this is God's will, I
will serve in the capacity in the best possible way,'' said Gomes.
   Last March, Pope John Paul II bowed to Mother Teresa's desire to
retire and accepted her resignation as head of the order she
founded. He had rejected her earlier requests to step down.
   The Yugoslavia-born Roman Catholic nun, known as the ``saint of
the gutters'' for her work with the destitute and dying, suffered a
nearly fatal heart attack a year ago. She returned to work but
asked for retirement within a few months.
   Mother Teresa was elected to a six-year term. The constitution
of her order calls for a maximum two terms, but the pope has waived
this clause in the past so Mother Teresa could remain in the post.
   Ballots were cast by 103 delegates summoned from missions around
the globe.
   The election was held a year ahead of schedule because Mother
Teresa wanted to step down.
   Gomes indicated that the sisters were swayed by the new
democratization of Eastern Europe and the opportunities to open new
missions.
   ``The feeling was that with so much opening up in the Western
world and in Eastern Europe, they need someone who can face the
challenge,'' he said. He spoke to reporters in the garden of an
institution for retarded women and children where the assembly was
held.
   Mother Teresa's decision to retire had raised questions about
the future of the Missionaries of Charity. Church officials have
said nuns on her six-member administrative council were capable but
did not have her worldwide recognition, determination and charisma,
which opened many of the financial and political doors needed to
accomplish the work of the mission.
   Mother Teresa's ministry to the poor and helpless began in
earnest 43 years ago in the gutters of Calcutta. She gave up a
comfortable teaching job at a Roman Catholic school to care for
those whom no one else would touch.
   Literally plucking dying people from the streets of the teeming
metropolis, Mother Teresa went on to found a series of homes in
Calcutta and eventually throughout the world for society's
castaways.
   At the height of the Israeli siege of West Beirut in 1982, she
walked between the guns of the Israeli army and the Palestine
Liberation Organization to rescue children trapped without food and
medicine in a front-line hospital. The shooting stopped until her
rescue mission was completed.
   Today, the Missionaries of Charity operates 430 homes in 95
countries for lepers, cripples, destitute consumptives, abandoned
babies and others with no place to turn. She was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1979.
   After she was released from a hospital a few months after the

<HEAD>Budget Negotiators At Odds Over Revenues, Defense Cuts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Administration officials and
congressional leaders are voicing optimism about their revived
budget talks, but the two sides still must overcome their
differences on taxes and military spending.
   Before heading into the second straight day of negotiations
today at Andrew Air Force Base, 10 miles outside Washington in
suburban Maryland, each side held meetings to review the other
side's position.
   The negotiators hope to craft a deal by Monday chopping about
$50 billion out of next year's federal deficit and $500 billion out
of the shortfall over the next five years.
   ``I think there is a new spirit of optimism that we can get an
agreement,'' President Bush told reporters Friday as he arrived at
Andrews for a 30-minute visit with bargainers.
   ``We feel positive and optimistic,'' the Democrat's chief
negotiator, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri,
said as the talks picked up after a five-week summer break.
   The two sides, meeting in the main bar and restaurant of the
Andrews' officers club, swapped offers Friday for the first time
since the talks began in May. Officials speaking on condition they
not be identified described them.
   Republicans submitted a $52.5 billion plan for next year, which
starts Oct. 1. It contains $20.4 billion in new taxes, $5.6 billion
in new federal fees, and $4 billion in defense cuts.
   GOP taxes included levies on alcohol, a limit on state and local
income tax deductions, and a cut in the capital gains tax rate.
Bush says the lower rate would raise money by encouraging people to
sell real estate and other property.
   The Democratic plan called for $50 billion in savings next year
and $500 billion over five years.
   It relies on $26.9 billion in taxes and fees and $14.9 billion
in defense reductions.
   Its taxes include levies on energy and gasoline. Details were
not available.
   Unless deficit cuts are enacted by Oct. 1, the Gramm-Rudman law
will slice $100 billion from federal spending next year, an amount
officials consider intolerably harsh.
   The bargainers hope to reach a compromise by Monday to give
Congress time to write the measure into law.

   A Vietnamese man faces sentencing for his
part in the gang attack on a countryman's home in which an
8-year-old boy was strung up with wire and his father made the
target in a game of Russian roulette.
   After three hours of deliberation, a jury in this Washington,
D.C., suburb found Bao Quoc Doan guilty of 10 charges, including
burglary, robbery, abduction and use of a firearm. Doan, 21, was
the second person convicted in the attack, and he faces a second
trial in October stemming from another incident.
   The Fairfax County Circuit Court jury recommended that Doan, of
no fixed address, be sentenced to life in prison plus 56 years.
   Doan was one of at least five men, three of whom wore masks, who
stormed the home of a Vietnamese-born restaurateur in Falls Church
on Feb. 24, Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Mark Simmons said.
   The attack was one of eight in the county this year in which
homes of Asian families have been invaded by groups, often made up
of Vietnamese men.
   The attacks target business people in Vietnamese communities who
are then threatened or beaten until they reveal where valuables are
hidden. According to testimony, the assailants ran a meat cleaver
against the neck of a 10-year-old boy in the household in addition
to the attacks on his 8-year-old brother and the gun threat against
their father.

<HEAD>Bush Hopes to Strengthen `Common Approach' to Gulf With Gorbachev</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev
arrived today for their third summit, a meeting Bush said he hoped
would ``strengthen our common approach'' to fighting Iraqi
aggression in the Persian Gulf.
   ``If the nations of the world, acting together, continue as they
have been to isolate Iraq and deny Saddam the fruits of aggression,
we will set in place the cornerstone of an international order more
stable and secure than any we have known,'' Bush said at a red
carpet arrival ceremony.
   Gorbachev arrived Saturday night, nearly eight hours after Bush,
and declared the two leaders were meeting at ``a crucial moment in
history,'' to make sure positive trends in world relations ``are
not thwarted by any developments.''
   The Soviet leader said they would focus on ``the acute crisis in
the Persian Gulf and a number of other issues.''
   In addition to the Persian Gulf crisis, Bush said he and
Gorbachev would discuss superpower arms control, changes in Europe
and the Soviet leader's economic reforms.
   In brief remarks at the U.S. Embassy, Bush spoke of how
fortunate it was ``to have the Soviet Union very much in accord
with what we're trying to do'' to stop Iraq's aggression.
   ``Tomorrow we'll be speaking not to some adversary but to a
leader of a country with whom I think we are going to have
increasingly productive relations,'' said Bush.
   The sun peeked through overcast skies as the president's
spanking new Boeing 747 Air Force One touched down after an
overnight flight from Washington. In town, the signs of summitry
were everywhere _ from the American, Soviet and Finnish flags
flying together to the extended hours that stores were staying open
to cash in on the invasion of thousands of potential customers.
   Several thousand people were in the streets around the
presidential palace waiting for a glimpse of the American
president's motorcade. The usual tight security was in place _
vehicles blocking intersections and police sharpshooters
overlooking the scene. A helicopter hovered overhead.
   ``This meeting comes at a critical time, at a moment when the
actions we take can shape this new world for years to come,'' Bush
said.
   ``In the past many regional conflicts have played themselves out
against the background of the larger conflict of the Cold War.
Renegade regimes and unpredictable rulers resorted to force,
counting on superpower stalemate to frustrate a united response,''
he said. ``But the international response to Iraq's invasion proves
how much has changed.''
   Even before the first handshake, a Soviet official raised the
possibility the two leaders might decide to extend their talks into
Monday. ``It's unpredictable. It's up to them,'' said the official,
who insisted on anonymity.
   Gorbachev has been supportive of Bush's efforts to isolate Iraq
in response to Saddam Hussein's August invasion of Kuwait. And even
a joint summit statement reiterating a demand for an Iraqi
withdrawal would be a remarkable event, marking the first time the
one-time rivals have spoken jointly on a major international issue
other than arms control in more than four decades.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, speaking Friday on
his way back to Moscow from Tokyo, said he is ``ready if
necessary'' to go to Iraq to seek a peaceful resolution of the gulf
crisis.
   Bush raised his hopes for a united U.S.-Soviet front against
Iraq out of the Sunday summit.
   ``Here in Helsinki, President Gorbachev and I meet, hopefully to
strengthen our common approach to this unjustifiable act of
aggression,'' Bush said.
   Iraq's aggression in the Middle East overshadowed even the
stubborn disagreements blocking completion of treaties to slash
nuclear stockpiles and reduce troop and conventional arms in Europe
in the post-Cold War era. Officials said Bush and Gorbachev would
devote part of their five hours of summit talks to those issues, as
well as to regional concerns such as Afghanistan.
   Speaking to reporters accompanying him here aboard Air Force
One, Bush said he would not ask Gorbachev to contribute troops to
the multinational force defending Saudi Arabia.
   ``I have no plans to do that, but I will be talking about a wide
array of cooperative arrangements,'' Bush said.
   Bush said he was interested in trading U.S. oil technology for
oil from the Soviet Union, the world's largest producer, and an oil
deal ``could well come up at these meetings.''
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said earlier
in the day that the Soviet Union would be willing to send military
forces to the Middle East under a military staff committee that
included officers from the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council.
   The talks came as both presidents coped with economic
difficulties at home.
   Gorbachev is expected to announce a series of radical economic
reforms when he returns home to Moscow next week that could
transfer power from the central government to authorities in the 15
Soviet republics.
   Bush left behind a weakening economy possibly sliding into
recession.
   Administration officials said the summit would be an informal
session for consultation and play down prospects for any major
announcements or new initiatives. Bush proposed the meeting.
   After their overnight flight from Washington, Bush and his wife
Barbara went to the Finnish presidential palace with Finland's
President Mauno Koivisto and his wife.
   Later, en route to address American diplomats and their families
at the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, Bush briefly stopped his motorcade
at a crowded marketplace and briefly waded into the excited crowd,
shaking hands.
   After speaking at the embassy, Bush moved on to his government
guest quarters at the Kalastajatorppa Hotel.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was arriving Saturday from
his tour of European and Middle East capitals seeking financial
support for the deployment of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.
   ``It is an unstructured agenda,'' Bush spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said of the summit, the third that Bush has held with
Gorbachev as president.
   And despite the continued presence of Soviet military advisers
in Iraq, Fitzwater went out of his way in a pre-summit briefing for
reporters to praise the Soviets for their ``real and very helpful
support in the Persian Gulf'' and to say that
   For their part, the Soviets have said they were looking forward
to sessions devoid of the ``theatrics'' of other superpower
summits, and reflecting the improved relationship in the post-Cold
War era.
   While the Soviets have opposed Saddam's occupation of Kuwait,
the summit gives Bush an opportunity to respond to Soviet
misgivings about the U.S. military buildup in the region. Gorbachev
has voiced concern about ``unpredictable consequences'' of military
confrontation.
   Moscow has been Baghdad's primary arms supplier and still has
advisers in Iraq. Gorbachev met with the Iraqi foreign minister
earlier in the week, and Bush may sound out Gorbachev on the Iraqi
position.
   The two leaders last met in Washington in early June. Their
first summit was at Malta last December.

<TEXT>
   PLO forces shelled guerrillas loyal to
terrorist Abu Nidal and battled hand-to-hand today in alleys during
widening clashes that killed at least 46 people, police said.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization offensive to oust Abu
Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council from south Lebanon spread to
areas around Sidon, a coastal city about 25 miles south of Beirut.
   Police report at least 163 people have been wounded since the
latest battles began Friday.
   Abu Nidal's spokesman, Walid Khaled, said in a statement from
Beirut that the group was ``ready to accept a cease-fire.'' Prime
Minister Salim Hoss and leaders of Moslem factions also urged for a
halt to the fighting.
   But loyalists of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat ignored the pleas
and raided houses where Abu Nidal's men were believed to be hiding.
Mortar shells and rocket-propelled grenades exploded on other
suspected Abu Nidal strongholds.
   Police said shells fell at the rate of 20 a minute during some
periods.
   An estimated 100 Abu Nidal guerrillas were entrenched in their
last bastion about five miles east of Sidon.
   Also, pockets of Abu Nidal gunmen were still holding out in
several parts of the sprawling Ein el-Hilweh shantytown, where an
estimated 32,000 refugees live.
   PLO officers with bullhorns called on the rivals to, ``Surrender
or die. There's no way out. Surrender if you want to survive.''
   The response was volleys of automatic weapons fire.
   ``Abu Nidal's men are putting up tough resistance in the few
places they still hold in the camp,'' said a police spokesman, who
cannot be identified under briefing regulations.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, broke away from
the PLO in 1973 and was sentenced to death in absentia by a PLO
tribunal for killing Arafat aides.
   He has been based in Iraq, Syria and Libya. His current
headquarters are near Tripoli, Libya's capital.
   Abu Nidal is sought by the United States and some Western
European nations for terrorist attacks over the last 15 years,
including massacres at Rome and Vienna airports in December 1985
that killed at total of 20 people.
   He is also wanted in connection with the hijacking of a Pan
American World Airways jet in Karachi, Pakistan, in September 1986.
In that operation, 20 passengers were killed and 120 wounded.
   Security sources say Abu Nidal's faction has increasingly been
allied with the Syrians, which has about 40,000 troops in Lebanon.
   Arafat, with about 5,000 guerrillas in south Lebanon, is seeking
undisputed control over the Sidon region and ordered his forces to
eliminate Abu Nidal loyalists.
   In June, Arafat's guerrillas crushed a 200-man Abu Nidal force
in the Rashadiyeh refugee camp near Tyre, about 50 miles south of
Sidon.

   A U.S. Army helicopter crashed
during a night training mission, and the pilot was hospitalized,
U.S. military spokesmen said Saturday. It was the second such crash
in two days.
   The OH-58 Kiowa scout helicopter went down about 9 p.m. Friday.
On Thursday, a Marine Corps AH-1 Cobra gunship tipped over after a
hard landing.
   The pilots of both aircraft suffered slight injuries.
   Both helicopters were on training missions, and their pilots
were believed to be using night-vision equipment. Officers said
they did not know if the special goggles, which have been
criticized as contributing to a number of mishaps in recent years,
were involved.
   The Kiowa, belonging to the 101st airborne division, crashed in
the southern Arabian peninsula, the Army said. It gave no other
details.

   The United States has protested to Yugoslavia
the arrest and alleged beating of an American citizen charged with
participating in a demonstration, the State Department said
Saturday.
   Shaban Kastrati, 19, of Plainfield, Ill., was arrested in Kosovo
province and sentenced on Aug. 31 to 60 days in prison for joining
a demonstration and throwing rocks, State Department spokesman Dave
Denny said.
   Denny said a formal protest was lodged with the Yugoslavian
Foreign Ministry after a U.S. consular officer visited Kastrati in
prison.
   The protest was based on Kastrati's account of mistreatment and
the consular officer's observations, Denny said.
   The Washington Post, in its Saturday editions, quoted the
youth's father, Mike Kastrati, as saying the consular officer had
reported that the young Kastrati had a cut chin and lip and
``bruises all over his body.''
   The Post said Kastrati was arrested Aug. 29 in the provincial
capital of Pristina as he was driving home after going to Belgrade
to welcome a U.S. congressional delegation led by Sen. Robert Dole,
R-Kan.
   The older Kastrati said his American-born son had been staying
with his grandparents in Kosovo, which has been hit by unrest
between the ruling ethnic Serbian minority and ethnic Albanians.

<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush strolled the narrow streets
of this picturesque town, an ancient Viking haunt, and said she was
looking forward to seeing Raisa Gorbachev and chatting about their
grandchildren.
   Mrs. Bush spent a chilly Saturday afternoon in Porvoo while her
husband met with Finnish President Mauno Koivisto in advance of
Sunday's summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   In a bright cherry red suit, Mrs. Bush trod carefully over the
cobblestones outside the 13th Century Lutheran Cathedral where
Russian Tsar Alexander I declared in 1809 the autonomy of the Grand
Duchy of Finland, then part of Russia.
   The white granite cathedral with red brick ornamental gables has
survived centuries of plundering and fires, first by the Danes and
later by the Russians. A Soviet bomb fell on it during World War
II, but caused little damage.
   Mrs. Bush shook hands with about half the 300 local residents
gathered outside the churchyard, hugged their babies, and joked
that she wanted to keep one of them.
   The first lady walked along one of Porvoo's medieval shopping
streets, admiring the old wooden buildings painted in bright shades
of mustard, red and blue, some displaying American flags in her
honor.
   In the local museum, she examined antique needlepoints and
lamented that needlework was a lost art among American children. A
display of jewelry crafted from human hair also caught her eye.
   This city of 20,000 people, a historically important trading
post 35 miles northeast of the capital Helsinki, has long attracted
Finnish painters and poets for its beauty.
   It was also a favorite of the Swedes when they controlled
Finland, and Swedish is still the mother tongue of nearly half its
residents, who call it Borga.
   The Gorbachevs arrived late Saturday afternoon for the summit.
Mrs. Gorbachev and Mrs. Bush are to have tea Sunday morning and
then view rare maps and books at the University of Helsinki, which
is marking its 350th anniversary.
   While relations between Mrs. Gorbachev and former first lady
Nancy Reagan were cool and sometimes testy, Mrs. Bush insisted
Saturday that she and her Soviet counterpart are friends who have
many common interests.
   ``I think it helps the husbands' relations if the wives are
friends. It softens the road a little bit,'' she told reporters.
   ``We're both interested in our countries, we're interested in
world peace,'' she said. ``On a very personal basis, I'm interested
in her grandchildren and she's interested in mine. We have a lot to
talk about.''
   The first lady urged support for world leaders trying to
dislodge ``that dreadful man,'' Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
from Kuwait.
   The Persian Gulf crisis sparked by Iraq's invasion and
annexation of Kuwait has ``affected the lives of everyone in the
world,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   ``Twenty-four countries have troops there, but those who don't
are (also) affected. So this is a very important time. We should be
backing our leaders with every bit of strength we have,'' she said.

   Pope John Paul II has impressed people
around the world with his knack for languages. Besides his native
Polish, the pontiff speaks fluent Italian and French and excels in
German, Spanish and English.
   Now he's getting rave reviews for his Swahili.
   During his swing through Tanzania, the first stop in a
four-nation African tour ending Monday in Ivory Coast, John Paul
spoke mostly in English. But he delighted the crowds by including
long passages in Swahili, the lingua franca of East Africa.
   Tanzanians said the pope's accent, pronunciation and delivery
were impeccable, even clearer than his English.
   It was no accident. Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro explained
that the pope prepares for all his trips abroad by listing to tapes
of the local languages. He began practicing Swahili a month before
this trip, his seventh to the continent.
   In Burundi and Rwanda, former Belgian protectorates in central
Africa, the pope has spoken in French but also laced his homilies
with brief expressions in Kirundi and Kinyarwanda.
   Sometimes the pope finds it difficult to hold the attention of
his African flock since many are uneducated, rural people who do
not understand English or French.
   For example, during a ceremony in Tabora, Tanzania, the 50,000
stadium seats were filled when the pope arrived. But once he
launched into an English-language homily, a few thousand people,
mostly youths, headed for the exits or milled around on the grass
infield.

<TEXT>
   The pope's foreign trips are planned to the last detail,
allowing little room for changes in the schedule. But John Paul is
beginning to make a habit of paying impromptu visits to African
villagers.
   In January, during a tour of the Sahel region, he stopped along
a dirt road in Guinea Bissau and wandered into a hut to greet a man
and his family. The pope was so struck by the living conditions
that he remarked, ``Freedom is compromised by poverty.''
   On Thurdsday, after celebrating Mass in Gitega, Burundi, the
pope visited with a family in a relatively comfortable house,
asking questions about the five children. Next, in a much poorer
area a mile away, he stepped into a dark, rudimentary hut and
embraced a small child.

<TEXT>
   John Paul is not always the only show in town.
   In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, about 100,000 people showed up for
his first Mass and many others tuned in on radio.
   But shortly after the pope rode off after the ceremony, the
city's attention and radio dials turned to another national
religion: soccer.
   Tanzania was playing Gabon in a qualifying round match of the
Africa Cup of Nations at the National Stadium. For the record, the
game ended in a scoreless draw.
   John Paul, an avid sportsman who played goalkeeper as a
youngster in Poland, is not one to ignore the popularity of soccer.
   In Kigali on Saturday, he presented the ``John Paul II Cup'' to
the winners of a 12-team national tournament held before his visit.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The pope's pilgrimage has taken him across one of Africa's most
famous wildlife zones _ from the plains of Serengeti in Tanzania to
the hills of Rwanda, home of rare mountain gorillas.
   John Paul has not taken time to visit any game parks, but he
received a stuffed lion as a gift from a Masai warrior in Moshi,
Tanzanzia, at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro.
   The pope does not want to offend local sensibilities by refusing
gifts, so the lion, along with the wood sculptures, fly wisks,
handicraft, paintings and other more conventional offerings, was
taken to the airport for loading onto his plane. But in the end,
the lion was left behind, apparently because of lack of room.

   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee said Saturday it is time to slow the deployment of
American forces to the Middle East and to implement a rotation
policy for troops already there.
   At the same time, the number of soldiers from Arab nations
helping defend Saudi Arabia should be increased, said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga.
   There are already more than 100,000 Americans in Saudi Arabia,
he noted.
   ``I think we've got deterrence there now, and I believe the
prime psychological and political benefit will come from getting
more Arab forces in there,'' he said.
   Nunn, talking with reporters at a convention of the Georgia
Democratic Party, said he does not advocate a cap on the size of
the American force, but thinks a rotation system should be
implemented to bring soldiers home.
   ``I think it's important that we understand those young men and
women are going to get awfully bored and tired and gritty and dirty
and hot, and we're going to have to have a rotation policy; I think
three to four months, maybe five months _ but some set period of
time.
   ``They need to be told they're going to rotate out of there. ...
It is important psychologically. It's important to keep the morale.
It's also important if we're going to demonstrate patience and
tenacity.''
   Nunn said he expected President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, meeting over the weekend in Finland, to
discuss possible alternative action in the Middle East in case the
embargo of Iraq fails.
   ``There has got to be a discussion of options and how we act,''
Nunn said. ``I certainly think we should not in any way be
surprising the Soviet Union. They have been enormously helpful
here.''
   He added: ``I think that Bush needs to have a frank discussion
of what we do down the road. I also believe that if we do have to
take military steps down the road, it ought to be done as much as
possible ... with other countries participating. That's why I keep
pushing for getting the Egyptians in there with heavy forces,
getting the Syrians in there with heavy forces.''

   Here is a transcript of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's remarks Saturday as he arrived for
his summit with President Bush:
   Mr. President and Mrs. Koivisto let me very warmly thank you and
through you the friendly people of Finland for your hospitality,
for receiving us, and for once again agreeing to participate in a
very important event.
   It is very symbolic that this important meeting between the
president of the Soviet Union and the president of the United
States will be taking place in Helsinki, which saw the birth of
some very important trends, very important developments which are
evolving today and which are gaining, acquiring further prospects.
   President George Bush expressed a wish for us to meet here at
this crucial moment in history when it is very important to compare
our political approaches and to cooperate in order to protect the
positive trends evolving in the world today, to make sure that they
are not thwarted by any development. And I was pleased to accept
that invitation, and given the rapid agreement of the government of
Finland, we are now here.
   And I hope that this meeting will be successful. It is important
for us to meet personally, although we have been in touch in
various ways through our personal representatives and in various
other ways. But it is necessary to meet in order to discuss the
acute crisis in the Persian Gulf and a number of other issues.
   And I would like to conclude my brief remarks by expressing the
very warm wishes to the people of Finland from all the peoples of
the Soviet Union. I wish prosperity to your country. Thank you.

   All-American Base Camp, home to
members of the Army's 82nd airborne, disappeared from the map last
week. From now on it's Champion City, the desert base camp for
soldiers from Fort Bragg, N.C.
   Military officials said the Saudi government, which is trying to
keep a wide distance between American troops and Saudi citizens,
asked for the name change.
   Other U.S. military outposts in the eastern desert have similiar
nicknames.
   Dragon City is the Army's 18th Airborne Corps headquarters. The
dragon is the corps' emblem.
   Falcon Forward Base Camp and Eagle Forward Base Camp are home to
the 101st Airborne air assault units. They are also known as the
Screaming Eagles.
   The Defense Department has barred reporters from pinpointing
locations of troops so the desert camps are always ``Somewhere in
Saudi Arabia.''

   Dragon City's medical clinic has been stripped of red crosses,
the emblem of the international relief organization.
   Saudi officials insisted the Americans remove the crosses, also
a symbol in Christian religions. Saudi Arabia's version of the Red
Cross relief organization is the Red Crescent society, marked by a
red sliver of the moon.
   All religions except for Islam are barred in Saudi Arabia; two
of Islam's holiest mosques are in Medina and Mecca and draw
pilgrims from around the world every year.
   Some medical units have not gotten the word on red crosses. The
28th combat support hospital still has them on its temporary
structures.

   When a congressional delegation passed through Saudi Arabia this
week, Marines in the field took the opportunity to complain about a

   When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping at Safeway.
That's where members of the 82nd Airborne went last week to buy
sponges and cleaning supplies for the barracks.
   Although Saudi Arabia is a traditional Islamic society, its
large expatriate community has brought with it Western-style stores
like Safeway and a mall with T-shirt shops and stores that sell
other clothes.

   It looks like Christmas gone mad.
   Plastic soldier targets, lit like holiday lawn ornaments, are
under assault. Orange tracers slice through them like death rays.
Bullets ricochet and flare with brief rose-colored intensity. A
bush catches fire, illuminating the night.
   The 265th Quartermaster Detachment, a water purification unit of
the South Carolina National Guard, is practicing night fire,
another skill they needed for duty in the Mideast.
   Some of the 14 men, all from the environs of Allendale, S.C.,
are exhilarated by the sound and light show they have staged.
   ``We are ready! We are ready!'' shouted Don Graham, a
construction supervisor, as they drove back to the barracks through
the sultry night. Some of the other men had already fallen asleep.
   There was little enthusiasm earlier in the day as the 265th, a
collection of civilians that includes construction workers, prison
guards, a truck driver and a college student, spent a long, hot and
dusty afternoon on the range, sweating, swearing and firing at
pop-up targets that sometimes failed to pop-up.
   The day begins with an almost picnic quality. The air is filled
with dragonflies and vibrant orange and yellow butterflies that
flitter and land on the flat black muzzles of the M-16s.
   There is even a picnic lunch of MRE's _ Meals, Ready-to-Eat _
book-sized foil packages that come in a variety of flavors.
   One of the many delicacies is tuna with noodles, a lukewarm glop
of casserole that comes with separate packages of:
   _Fortified cheese spread (knead package before opening)
   _Crackers
   _Chocolate nut cake
   _Beverage base powder, grape.
   As the name implies, you open the packages and eat. But there
are table manners to be learned. You can heat the meal by placing
the package in the sun. And you might want to think twice about
putting the grape mix in your canteen.
   ``You better be sure you like it cause your water's going to
taste like that forever,'' warns Sgt. Earnest Deloach.
   But haute cuisine only goes so far. The bucolic scene becomes
oppressive as the day grows long and the temperature soars into the
90s. Worst of all, the unit must don hellishly hot chemical
protective overclothes and the ever-present gas mask and try to
knock down targets.
   Bullets fly wide and heads ache from the Kevlar helmets. You
feel like the helmet has melted through your softened skull and
imbedded itself in your brain.
   ``My head hurts, I'm covered with dirt, I'm sweated through. The
only way I'm going to make it is if the good Lord lets me,'' said
Spec. Ulysses Calhoun as he struggled out of his chemical warfare
suit.
   ``The targets just aren't falling,'' says Spec. Mark Rooker.
   Rooker, 20, is the youngest and newest member of the unit. When
the other men stop to check out female personnel, Rooker wanders
over to check out the tanks and armored personnel carriers.
   He carries a large survival knife on his web gear and asks
hopefully about getting an M-203 grenade launcher for his rifle.
   Rooker wanted to join a National Guard firefighters unit, but
his training school would have interfered with college. So he took
a less exciting option, the 265th water purification unit.
   It has turned out to be anything but boring.
   ``I could be home right now, working in an air conditioned
bank,'' he said. ``I guess I made a mistake.''

   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
pledged more troops Saturday to defend Saudi Arabia against an
Iraqi attack and registered doubt President Saddam Hussein could be
stripped of his most dangerous weapons through diplomacy.
   Speaking to reporters after a 90-minute private session with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III at the opulent Ras-El-Tin
Palace on the Mediterranean, the Egyptian leader recommitted the
largest Arab nation to the U.S.-engineered drive to pressure Saddam
to reverse his Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait.
   ``We are supporting the Saudis as much as we can,'' Mubarak
said, referring to the 2,000 Egyptian troops now in Saudi Arabia
and his drive to rally Arab opposition to the Iraqi leader.
   Having held further discussions with the Saudis, Mubarak said,
``we will send them the forces needed, which is agreed upon. We
sent some forces now. We are intending to send other forces in the
very near future.''
   Baker flew from Egypt to Helsinki to join President Bush in
talks Sunday with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The main
topic is the Gulf crisis.
   Mubarak urged the two leaders to stand firm on the sanctions
voted by the U.N. Security Council.
   ``I hope that Gorbachev and Bush have one line for dealing with
this problem,'' Mubarak said. ``This would be a hell of problem in
this area if there are differences.''
   Saddan's invasion has swept away traditional Egyptian and Saudi
reluctance to line up overtly with the United States. Their strong
stand against Iraq, reinforced by a multi-billion dollar Saudi
contribution, has encouraged such Arab states as Morocco, Syria and
the Persian Gulf emirates to participate in an anti-Iraqi coalition.
   Mubarak was rewarded this week by the Bush administration with a
promise to forgive $7 billion in debts to the United States for
arms purchases.
   ``Let me simply state for the record how very appreciative and
pleased the United States is with the outstanding and courageous
leadership that you have demonstrated from the very beginning of
this crisis in the Persian Gulf,'' Baker said.
   Asked by a reporter if there could be peace in the Persian Gulf
so long as Saddam had nuclear and chemical war-making potential,
Mubarak replied: ``You know we are against chemical weapons,
against the presence of missiles because this is a very destructive
means. I think peace will never go with the presence of all these
forms of weapons in the area.''
   The United States and its supporters, in trying to harness
Saddam, are relying primarily on an economic boycott. The goal is
to weaken the Iraqi economy to the point Saddam will withdraw his
troops from Kuwait and restore the monarchy.
   But Mubarak showed impatience.
   Asked how long sanctions should be employed before resorting to
military action, Mubarak said: ``It is a matter of estimation _
one, or two or three months. It may last only one month, maybe two
months. But I'm telling you that doesn't mean it's going to stay
for one year.''
   Baker's meeting with Mubarak concluded a three-day trip to the
Middle East in which the secretary of state raised several billion
dollars. At the same time, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady was
asking for money in visits to world leaders in Paris, London,
Seoul, South Korea and Tokyo.
   The United States is trying to raise more than $25 billion to
defray the costs of the American military buildup in the Persian
Gulf and provide emergency assistance to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey,
three countries which have been hard hit by the trade embargo
against Iraq.
   Officials traveling with Brady said the United States hopes to
get $3.5 billion to the three ``front-line'' countries before the
end of 1990, with some funds arriving before the end of September
to meet urgent needs such as refugee resettlement.
   Another $7 billion would be disbursed to those countries through
the 12 months of 1991.
   The remaining $15 billion or so would go to reimburse the United
States for the $1 billion-a-month cost of the Persian Gulf military
buildup, the officials said.

   For two years, a small army of East German
secret police kept an intimidating vigil outside the home of Katja
Havemann, a revolutionary long before there was a revolution.
   Ms. Havemann ultimately helped lead the protests that toppled
the old government. On Saturday, she kept her own vigil inside the
former headquarters of the dreaded secret police, demanding to see
the records they kept on her.
   She was among 22 people who on Tuesday began occupying the
building that houses the secret files that the Stasi, as the force
was called, maintained on 6 million Germans.
   The activists have vowed to remain until both German governments
promise that the records will not be turned over to West Germany's
secret service when the two nations unite.
   But the protest wasn't the only thing going on Saturday at the
giant complex of buildings where the Communist regime's brutal
security service kept the population in check.
   On a cool, cloudy day, the headquarters of the feared Stasi was
a montage reflecting 40 years of oppression and one year of chaos,
a microcosm of the vanishing nation's dark past, troubled present
and uncertain future.
   A West Berlin property speculator prowled the grounds, looking
at some of the vacant buildings he hoped to buy now and sell later.
   ``I consider myself quite ethical,'' said the developer, who
spoke on the condition he not be identified. ``There is money to be
made here, but these people don't know how to do it.''
   As he drove away in a red Mercedes-Benz, workers hauled building
materials into one of the 30 buildings on the sprawling grounds.
   The building has been used as an unemployment office for the
last two months, and workers were dropping off materials to
renovate some of the rooms to accommodate the growing crush of job
seekers.
   More than 2 million of the nation's 8 million workers are either
unemployed or working shortened hours.
   ``We probably see 1,000 people a day now,'' said Horst Nitsche,
who works as a receptionist and was overseeing the delivery
Saturday of the building materials.
   In a parking lot across the street, a small bazaar was set up by
merchants hawking everything from smoked eel to sweat socks.
   Textile companies offered their unsold clothing, farmers peddled
wares that have been nudged off grocery store shelves by West
German products, and Christian Geissler displayed shoes made by his
struggling company in the southern city of Rosswein.
   Geissler, who runs the factory of 450 workers, said he and a
small staff made the three-hour drive to remind East Berliners that
the factory is still pumping out loafers and wingtips.
   East Germans have been buying goods from West German firms, and
Geissler said his company's survival is in doubt.
   ``Next year will tell,'' he said. ``We've been lucky so far. But
survival, now, is the main thing.''
   Nearby, Olaf Ulaemst sold Chinese-made radios, jewelry and toys.
He bought the goods from an East German importer who can no longer
get them into East German stores, which now stock Japanese- and
Western-made products.
   In front of another building, members of the New Forum civic
group that led the revolution passed out leaflets.
   The group is not only demanding public access to the secret
police files, but the dismissal of the hundreds of former
intelligence agents still working for the government.
   Ms. Havemann, one of the people occupying the file archives,
came out briefly.
   She was a prominent dissident for more than a decade before the
peaceful revolt last autumn. She said hundreds of police and Stasi
agents surrounded her and her husband's home during a 2{-year
period when they were under house arrest.
   ``We have to resolve this in a good way,'' she said of the Stasi
files. ``If we don't do it in a good way, the old way will come
back into the new Germany.''

   Hunger and hardship grew today for stranded refugees in Jordan
as well as among diplomats and other foreigners holed up in Kuwait,
whose Iraqi occupiers faced further pressure from a U.S.-Soviet
summit this weekend.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein told President Bush and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev to remember when they meet that ``Iraq did
not invade with its armies either of your countries.''
   ``I am not saying to you...what your decision should be,''
Saddam said in a statement read by an announcer on Iraqi
television. The comments were billed as an open message to the two
leaders before they meet in Helsinki, Finland.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak also looked ahead to the Sunday
summit. He said after meeting with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III today that he hoped the United States and the Soviet
Union could take a unified approach to the gulf crisis.
   ``I hope that Gorbachev and Bush have one line for dealing with
this problem,'' Mubarak said in English.
   Mubarak, who has been reluctant to discuss the size of the
Egyptian force deployed in the gulf region, said ``we intend to
send other forces in the very near future.'' He gave no details.
   Another freedom flight of Americans was expected out of Kuwait
today, a day after Saddam's government allowed 165 Americans and
some other foreigners to leave, the latest flights in the week-old
airlift.
   Iraq said today it would halt chartered flights to Amman,
Jordan, beginning Sunday because of Jordanian complaints they are
overwhelmed by the influx. But a spokesman for Amman's airport,
Mashhour El-Kurashi, said crowding at the airport was not a problem.
   Another possible motivation for the cutoff emerged when the
Iraqi spokesman, Naji al-Hadithi, suggested that the short-haul
charters to Amman were relatively unprofitable for Iraqi Airways.
   The Iraqi spokesman said regularly scheduled flights would
continue to leave normally, and the State Department said charters
to evacuate foreigners would continue as well, with destinations
other than Amman.
   Five weeks after Iraq invaded Kuwait, thousands of Americans and
other Westerners remain trapped in the two countries. Many are held
as human shields if war breaks out.
   Swedish and Norwegian diplomats today evacuated their embassies
in Kuwait but said they defied Saddam's order to officially close
them. Iraqi troops have surrounded the U.S. and other compounds,
where diplomats running low on supplies have been drinking boiled
swimming pool water and using furniture for firewood.
   Arriving today in Helsinki, Bush told reporters he hoped the
summit will ``strengthen our common approach to this unjustifiable
act of aggression.''
   In his arrival statement today, Gorbachev said the summit was
necessary to ensure that international actions against Iraq ``are
not thwarted by any developments.''
   Moscow said Friday that it would be willing to provide troops
for a U.N. peacekeeping force in the Persian Gulf _ if they were
under a joint command that included Soviet generals.
   Financial support for the effort to counter Saddam's Aug. 2
invasion of oil-rich Kuwait grew by the billions Friday. Pledges
came from Japan, South Korea and Kuwait, whose exiled leaders
promised $5 billion. Saudi Arabia pledged several billion Thursday.
   In Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, a U.S. military spokesman said one
pilot was hospitalized and a second escaped unhurt when a U.S. Army
helicopter crashed during a night training mission.
   The crash of the OH-58 Kiowa Scout helicopter Friday evening was
the second in two days. A Marine Corps AH-1 Cobra gunship tipped
over after a hard landing 24 hours earlier, slightly injuring both
pilots.
   About 100,000 U.S. troops are dug into the Saudi desert south of
the Kuwaiti border at an estimated cost of $1 billion a month,
facing an estimated 260,000 Iraqi soldiers in and around Kuwait.
Scores of U.S. and other warships in the Persian Gulf region are
enforcing a U.N.-sanctioned embargo against the Baghdad government.
   U.S. forces gained more momentum today when five amphibious
landing craft passed through Egypt's Suez Canal toward the gulf
region, bringing the total number since Monday to 12.
   Saddam, who seized Kuwait in a dispute over oil, land and money,
has called on Moslems to wage a holy war against the United States
and its allies in the gulf crisis.
   A Jordanian border official said 225,000 Egyptian refugees were
waiting to cross from Iraq but that Jordan was holding them back
because it was overwhelmed by the 100,000 refugees already stranded
in its desert.
   ``They are waiting under terrible conditions for permission to
cross into Jordan to continue their journey home,'' the official
said, who cannot be identified under regulations.
   ``But we cannot cope with such huge numbers before the Asian
evacuees already inside Jordan waiting for transportation to their
homes are shifted,'' he added.
   James N. Purcell, director of the International Organization for
Migration, appealed urgently in Jordan for ships and aircraft to
repatriate the Asians squatting in hot and dirty camps ``before
human suffering becomes a human tragedy.''
   The United States said Friday that it will dispatch 27,000 tons
of rice, vegetable oil and wheat flour worth $12 million to the
camps, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said in Washington.
The food is to be shipped from ports by Sept. 30, a statement
issued by the department said.
   Other countries have pledged millions of dollars in relief, but
distribution has been slow.
   In Kuwait, a few foreign embassies _ including the U.S. mission
_ were still defying a 2-week-old Iraqi order to shut their doors.
But without power, water, telephone service or food, the diplomats
were being forced to retreat. The embassies have tried to stay open
in part to avoid the appearance of having accepted Iraq's
annexation of the emirate, in part to try to provide protection to
their citizens. About 2,200 Americans remain in Iraq and Kuwait,
U.S. officials estimate.
   But there was less and less they could do to help. Americans
arriving in the Jordanian capital of Amman on Friday aboard a
U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways jet described desperate conditions.
   ``Until I felt my feet on freedom, it was just terrifying,''
said Elena Reyes of Los Angeles. ``I didn't know night and day when
they would come and knock down my door.''
   ``It's terrible there,'' said Patricia Hammer of Denver.
``People are frightened, they're in hiding, running out of food.''
   State Department spokesman Mark Dillen said U.S. officials hoped
another group of Americans would leave Kuwait for Amman today, and
fly to Charleston, S.C., later during the weekend, along with
Friday's 165 arrivals.
   Of the Iraqi order to halt charter flights to Amman starting
Sunday, a State Department spokesman said today: ``The evacuation
flights will continue.'' The spokesman said a charter flight on
Sunday was to fly from Baghdad to London, which might be a new
destination for the freedom flights.
   Dillen said Iraqi authorities continued to round up American men
and have nearly 90 in detention. He said the latest addition to the
list was an American man picked up Thursday in Kuwait with his
non-American wife. He was subsequently taken to Baghdad.
   Kuwait's government-in-exile told Baker in Saudi Arabia on
Friday that it would help bankroll the military effort. A day
earlier, Saudi Arabia had pledged several billion dollars toward
defraying the cost of the U.S. deployment.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, wrapping up a mission that
took him to Paris, London, Seoul and Tokyo, said Friday that Japan
and South Korea gave new assurances of support for the campaign
against Iraq.
   European Community ministers in Rome Friday offered no money for
the military effort, though individual West European nations have
committed ships to the gulf flotilla.
   The ministers agreed to give $2 billion in economic aid to
Turkey, Jordan and Egypt to compensate them for trade lost as a
result of the U.N. sanctions against Iraq. They also granted more
food and other emergency aid for refugees.

<HEAD>Bush Suggests Possible U.S.-Soviet Oil Swap to Help Both
Superpowers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Saturday raised the
possibility of a unique superpower swap: American state-of-the-art
oil technology for some of the Soviet Union's vast, untapped crude
resources.
   ``I have no problem with that at all,'' Bush said en route to
the Finnish capital for his summit Sunday with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the third high-powered meeting between the
two leaders.
   ``I would welcome the best in American know-how on oil
production, drilling and seismic work going to the Soviet Union,''
he told reporters aboard Air Force One. ``I think it is something
we can work closely (on) with the Soviet Union.''
   Bush said he had mentioned the idea to the Soviet leader and
that they might discuss it further at their one-day summit, which
is expected to focus mostly on the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Such an exchange could serve the needs of both countries.
   The United States, with ample supplies of sophisticated
petroleum technology, is thirsty for oil, even more so since the
Persian Gulf crisis has shut off millions of barrels of crude to
consuming nations.
   But unlike West Germany, it doesn't have the cash to funnel into
development projects badly needed by the Kremlin to shore up its
sagging economy.
   The Soviet Union, the world's largest oil producer, is desperate
for the revenues, which would flow from an upgraded petroleum
industry.
   ``It's a good trade,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the
Boston Co. ``They have the resources, and we have the know-how.''
   John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation in New York, said, ``It's definitely a good idea.
There's nothing negative about it.''
   He also noted that ``any increase in oil production in the world
would lower dependence on the Middle East.''
   The suggestion comes at a time of a world oil crunch caused by
the international embargo on 4 million barrels a day of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti crude. The economic sanctions were imposed by the United
Nations after Iraq invaded and occupied its tiny, oil-rich neighbor
on Aug. 2.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 1 crude exporter, and other
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have
agreed to pump as much as they can to make up the shortfall. But
analysts predict there still will be a gap on the market that could
widen with colder weather in the coming months in the United States
and other consuming nations.
   However, analysts said, any deal worked out with the Soviet
Union to bring more oil into the United States was unlikely to do
much to alleviate possible shortages this year.
   The Soviet Union produced 12.1 million barrels of oil a day last
year, which amounted to a sixth of the world's total and more than
the combined output of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait.
   But analysts expect Soviet output, crimped by an outmoded
system, to tumble by about a half million barrels a day this year.
   It exported 3.7 million barrels a day _ second only to Saudi
Arabia _ with about half going to Western buyers.
   With oil prices soaring because of the gulf crisis, Moscow will
likely earn a windfall this year of hundreds of millions of dollars.
   Every $1 a barrel increase could mean $1 billion a year in
additional hard currency for the Soviet economy, according to
analysts' estimates. In 1989, oil exports brought some $20 billion
in hard currency into the Soviet Union, accounting for about 40
percent of the country's hard currency earnings.
   Even before Bush's suggestion, the Kremlin had begun eyeing
Western oil companies to help expand the country's oil exploration
and improve production facilities, deteriorating from years of
neglect.
   ``The Soviet Union doesn't know how to bring oil out of the
ground, to refine it and ship it,'' said Sinai.
   Both Chevron Corp. and Texaco Corp. have reached preliminary
agreement with the Soviets on joint oil exploratory ventures.
American service companies also are participating in oil
exploration with the Soviets, as is the French oil company Elf
Aquitaine.

<HEAD>Eight Killed in Fighting Among Blacks</HEAD>

   Eight black men were shot,
stabbed or burned to death in a series of attacks around the
country, police said Saturday.
   Police said four men were killed in Soweto and two died in
Tokoza, two townships outside Johannesburg that have been hit hard
by the black factional fighting that has claimed almost 600 lives
since it began Aug. 12.
   Two men were killed in separate attacks in the eastern province
of Natal, police said in the daily unrest report, which covers
incidents from the previous 24 hours.
   Most of the fighting in the Johannesburg area has pitted Zulu
backers of the conservative Inkatha movement against Xhosas and
other blacks loyal to the African National Congress.
   However, there also apparently have been random attacks in
recent days with no clear link to the factional fighting.
   The ANC and Inkatha blame each other for the fighting. The ANC
alleges police have sided with Inkatha, further fueling the
violence.
   Government and police leaders have said individual officers may
have acted improperly but that the police force as a whole has
remained impartial.
   Both black groups oppose apartheid, but they differ over tactics
and plans for a future South Africa.
   The more militant ANC waged a guerrilla campaign for 29 years
before suspending operations last month. The organization still
supports sanctions, strikes, boycotts and other confrontational
measures that Inkatha does not endorse.
   Inkatha, led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi and made up almost entirely
of Zulus, favors capitalism in contrast to the socialist-oriented
ANC.
   The two sides have been fighting for supremacy since 1986 in the
eastern province of Natal, and about 5,000 people have been killed
in the violence.
   The ANC has been leading the fight for an end to apartheid and
President F.W. de Klerk's government has been holding preliminary
talks with the group to clear the way for negotiations on ending
white-minority rule.
   The anti-apartheid Democratic Party said Saturday it wants to
join the government and the ANC in future negotiations.
   De Klerk has said all opposition groups would be welcome for
formal constitutional talks, which he hopes to begin soon.
   The Democrats hold 33 of the 166 elected seats in the white
chamber of Parliament. De Klerk's National Party has 94 seats and
the pro-apartheid Conservative Party has 39 seats.
   The Democrats are not expected to play a central role in any
political settlement, but the party is seen as a barometer of
liberal, white opinion and could form an alliance with another
organization.
   De Klerk says he wants to replace the apartheid system of racial
segregation with a constitution that would allow the 5 million
whites and 30 million blacks to share power. But he wants
guarantees for whites under any further black-majority government.
Blacks now have no voice in national affairs.

   Singer Luther Vandross wants to make sure he has
a hot show this week in Detroit.
   Vandross likes to keep the air conditioning turned down because
the cold air affects his voice, Brass Ring Productions spokesman
Jeff Elwood said.
   ``He likes to sing in warm buildings,'' Elwood said. ``He
believes he does a better show when it's off.''
   At the time of his last show in Detroit, two weeks ago, the
temperature outside was in the 80s.
   Fans may be a little more comfortable the end of this week when
Vandross returns to Detroit for three days _ the temperature will
be only in the middle 70s.

   Pop singer Madonna, artist David Hockney,
Rep. Henry Waxman and British actor Ian McKellen were honored for
their efforts to combat AIDS during a fund-raiser organizers said
generated more than $1 million.
   Among the performers at Friday night's show were Madonna,
violinist Joshua Bell, and singers Rod Stewart, Sarah Brightman and
Toni Childs.
   ``AIDS is about living people, not just cases,'' said Waxman,
D-Calif., chairman of the House Subcommittee on Health and the
Environment.
   David Wexler, chairman of AIDS Project Los Angeles, said the
event raised more than $1,150,000 for the 8-year-old nonprofit
organization.
   Others attending included Henry Winkler, Susan Blakely, Marlee
Matlin, Bette Midler, Angela Lansbury, Gregory Harrison and Lynn

   Rising country music star Garth Brooks
says he met his wife, Sandy, when he broke up a fight she was
involved in at a nightclub in Stillwater, Okla.
   Brooks, a finalist for five Country Music Association awards
this year, said in an interview that he was a bouncer at the
nightspot in 1983 when he was summoned to halt a dispute in the
women's restroom.
   ``These two gals had her cornered ...,'' Brooks recalled. ``She
took a swing at this one ol' gal and missed her. But her fist went
through the pressed-wood stall and she couldn't get it back out.
   ``She was just madder than a hornet.''
   Brooks removed her fist and threw her out of the club. But he
later began telephoning her and they were married in 1986.
   Brooks' hit records include ``If Tomorrow Never Comes'' and
``The Dance.'' He is a finalist for the CMA's male vocalist of the
year, single of the year, song of the year, Horizon Award and video
of the year.

   Oakland A's outfielder Jose Canseco almost
didn't make it to the outfield at all, thanks to one of those
notorious New York cab drivers.
   Canseco left the team's hotel about 4:45 p.m. Friday in order to
arrive at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx for a 7:30 game.
   The trip north out of Manhattan would take about 30 minutes by
subway.
   It took Canseco more than two hours.
   ``The cab driver thought I said Shea Stadium,'' Canseco said
after the A's beat the Yankees 7-1. Shea is in the borough of
Queens.
   ``We were about 10 minutes from Shea when I realized the
mistake. I said: `Take me to Yankee Stadium.'
   ``The fare was $60, but he told me to make it half. He was lucky
to get that. You know the way New York is. There was massive
traffic. Everyone beeps their horn. And the language, it was
atrocious.''

   Entertainer Tony Orlando feels something
special for those yellow ribbons, the ubiquitous symbol of hope for
loved ones held captive.
   The singer known for ``Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak
Tree'' said in a telephone interview Friday that he discovered the
song's deep emotional effect shortly after it was released.
   It was in 1973, and the group Dawn, featuring Orlando as lead
singer, was the opening act at a Bob Hope show at the Cotton Bowl
in Dallas. About 400 or 500 former prisoners of war were seated in
front of the stage.
   The song is based on a Civil War story about the homecoming of a
Union soldier from a Confederate prison. In the song, the man is
welcomed by yellow ribbons as he comes home from a stint in prison.
The message moved the former POWs.
   ``I'm on stage and I'm singing this song and all of a sudden it
was the most spine-chilling moment ...,'' he said. ``Up they got,
off their chairs, and they're coming toward the stage and they come
on stage and they begin to sing the song.''
   Orlando said Friday's interview with The Sun Herald of Biloxi,
Miss., was the first he'd ever done about the song, and said the
Iraq-Kuwait crisis was the reason.
   ``Normally, I duck it,'' he said. ``This is a different
situation. I just feel that we're in a posture of war. They've got
like 2,000 people there still, who are hostages.''

   A 19-year-old man is accused of raping his
mother and beating her to death with a baseball bat after she tried
to stop him from sexually assaulting a 4-year-old child, police
said.
   Andy Leon Vigil is charged with first-degree murder, aggravated
sexual assault and rape of a child in a complaint filed in court
Friday.
   Vigil was arrested after his mother, Juanita Vigil Madragil, 40,
was found unconscious in her central city apartment last Sunday.
She later died of head injuries at LDS Hospital.
   Detectives believe the mother found Vigil in a bedroom of her
home, molesting a 4-year-old girl for whom she was baby-sitting,
and confronted him, said police Lt. Norm Thompson.
   Thompson said the man turned on his mother, clubbed her with a
baseball bat, raped her, then beat her with the bat.
   Vigil is being held in the Salt Lake County Jail in lieu of
$500,000 bail.

<HEAD>Economic Task Force Heads off Confrontation Between Yeltsin and
Gorbachev</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A task force on economic reform will let the
national legislature resolve policy differences between political
rivals Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, a top official said
Saturday.
   The Soviet president and Yeltsin, president of the republic of
Russia, had ordered the task force to come up with a single plan
for the economy before Monday's opening session of the national
parliament.
   Their representatives decided late Friday to leave key points of
disagreement for the national and republic parliaments to resolve,
said Anatoly Lukyanov, chairman of the national Supreme Soviet
legislature.
   Lukyanov said the task force ``will present a unified plan with
alternatives on several issues.''
   He refused to discuss the points of disagreement.
   The news agency Tass quoted Russian Prime Minister Ivan Silaev
as saying the national plan called for price increases and
maintaining centralized control over the economy, while the Russian
plan did not.
   Yeltsin has said that Russia will go ahead with radical economic
reform on its own if Gorbachev and national authorities continue to
delay. Since Russia is the largest Soviet republic _ with half the
country's people and three-quarters of its land _ the Kremlin had
to take Yeltsin's warning seriously.
   Russia's Supreme Soviet legislature is to debate its radical
plan starting Monday and may adopt it Tuesday.
   It calls for eliminating the Kremlin's authority to levy taxes,
among other changes. Russia would immediately legalize private
ownership of land under the plan.
   Lukyanov, speaking at a news conference Saturday, said the
national legislature would not act on the task force proposal until
it has been discussed in each of the 15 republics' parliaments.
   Lukyanov also said 13 bills on economic reform have already been
sent to parliamentary committees for review. He said they include
draft laws on protection of individual property and inventions,
pricing, entrepreneurship, banking, use of foreign currency,
employment, customs, social security, insurance, foreign investment
and support for invalids and other disadvantaged groups.
   Other bills on the Supreme Soviet agenda for the coming session
include one that would guarantee freedom to emigrate and to travel.
The United States has refused to grant the Soviet Union
preferential trade treatment until it enacts such a law.
   Legislation on freedom of religion and creation of public
organizations and political parties also will be considered,
Lukyanov said.

   Two police officers were killed Friday during a guerrilla ambush
in a rural region of eastern Colombia, the spokesman said. About 60

<HEAD>Budget Bargainers Get Seclusion, Private Rooms at Maryland
Airfield</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just 10 miles from the U.S.
Capitol but light years from its distractions and temptations,
bargainers at this year's down-to-the-wire budget talks have found
a nice, quiet home.
   Quiet, that is, if you don't mind the roar of an occasional Air
Force F-4D fighter or a squadron of helicopters taking off and
landing. The 6,840-acre base has 129 aircraft, 28,010 personnel and
is home to Air Force One, the president's jet.
   Budget bargaining began Friday at the base, which was built in
1943 and until now was best known for all those shots of presidents
or other world leaders waving from the doorways of airplanes.
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman and the chief
Democratic negotiator, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., selected Andrews because reporters and lobbyists could be
kept away from the bargainers.
   In addition, lawmakers in the bargaining room would not be
tempted to leave because of a meeting with a constituent, lunch
with a lobbyist or the lure of a bank of television cameras.
   Because the negotiators want to fashion a budget deal by Monday,
Andrews offered another attraction: free room and board, so the
talks could start early and go late.
   Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., one of the bargainers, said each
private dorm room had a kitchenette and, he said with a smile, was
``like a first-class hotel.''
   But apparently not all of his colleagues saw the same luxury
Conte did. Of the 21 lawmakers and the two or three administration
officials involved in the bargaining, only seven of them stayed
overnight Friday, an aide said.

<TEXT>
   The negotiations are being held in what is normally the main bar
and restaurant of the Andrews officers' club, a sprawling,
single-story brick and glass building reminiscent of a suburban
high school.
   Next door are two single-story bungalows done in tan stucco.
Republicans are using the Essex House as their conference area;
Democrats have been assigned Shelton Manor. In appearance, neither
one recalls the English countryside.
   The officers' club bar has large, potted plants around its
perimeter, large speakers and a large-screen television, and an
orange-brown rug that one participant says give it the feel of a
billiards room. There is no built-in bar table.

   Before the talks began Friday morning, reporters had their
equipment inspected by the Secret Service and were then herded onto
buses to be taken from the press center to the officers' club,
about two miles away.
   When they got there, they were herded again into a roped-off
portion of the parking lot in front of the officers' club.
   Gradually, cars bearing House and Senate members and their aides
began pulling up, and reporters beckoned to them to come to the
microphones. At one point, Sens. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, obliged and answered questions.
   One Andrews public relations officer shook his head at the sight
of reporters shouting one question after another at the lawmakers.
   ``If these were generals, I'd say, `Thank you, sirs,''' he told
a congressional aide, referring to the remark press secretaries
often make to end news conferences.
   The congressional staff worker responded, ``You don't do that to
politicians.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Several minutes later, Gephardt answered some questions and
disappeared into the officers' club to await the arrival of
President Bush. The president was not scheduled to speak, and White
House officials told congressional aides to disconnect and remove
the microphones before his arrival.
   The aides only had time to remove the public address system when
the presidential motorcade pulled up. Unexpectedly, Bush bounded
out of his limousine and marched right up to the microphones, where
he spoke briefly before entering the building.
   With the public address system no longer working, most of the
reporters in the crowd had to compare notes with their colleagues
who had been close enough to the president to hear what he actually
said.
   Or, presumably, they had to read his lips.

   The budget talks began in May and got virtually nowhere by the
time they broke off in early August for Congress' summer recess. At
the time, jokes were heard about how the negotiators had discussed
everything but the shape of the bargaining table, a reference to a
stumbling block during the Paris peace talks on the Vietnam War.
   Well, the budget bargainers now have discussed the shape of the
table _ and done something about it.
   The bargaining table originally was laid out in a U-shaped
configuration. But it didn't take long for people to realize that
the acoustics in the large room made hearing difficult. The
solution: the table was reconfigured into a square.

<HEAD>Foundation to Review Decision to Stop Funding Planned Parenthood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retailer's charitable foundation will
review the decision to end 22 years of donations to Planned
Parenthood, a decision that prompted some customers to destroy
their credit cards in protest.
   In August, the Dayton Hudson Foundation turned down Planned
Parenthood's request for $20,000 for family-planning programs,
saying it hoped to distance itself from the abortion issue. Now
that decision is being reviewed, Cynthia Mayeda, the foundation's
head, said in a statement Friday.
   The move angered many Dayton Hudson Corp. customers who support
abortion rights. They cut up their credit cards and returned them
to the company.
   The company operates stores known as Dayton's or Hudson's in
seven Midwestern states, as well as Target discount stores. It also
owns California-based Mervyn's department stores, and last spring
announced the purchase of the Chicago-based Marshall Field chain.
   The foundation is a separate entity set up by the company to
manage its charitable contributions.
   Ms. Mayeda said meetings with Planned Parenthood officials will
be held in coming months. ``We are confident that as we work
together we will arrive at commonly sought, mutually agreed-upon
solutions,'' she said.
   Thomas Webber, executive director of Planned Parenthood of
Minnesota, said he was delighted by the foundation's decision to
reconsider.
   ``It is something we had hoped for, but if you asked me a week
ago to predict when, I wouldn't have said today,'' Webber said.
``It is swifter than we thought.''
   The foundation's announcement came the same day that the Twin
Cities chapter of the National Organization for Women rallied
outside Dayton's Minneapolis flagship store to call for a boycott
of all Dayton Hudson stores.
   The company has received letters and phone calls on both sides
of the issue, Dayton's spokeswoman Ann Barkelew said, but she
acknowledged that the larger number disagreed with the foundation's
action.
   Peggy Lucas of the Women's Consortium of Minnesota said her
group, which supports freedom of choice on abortion, would continue
to press the company to restore funds to Planned Parenthood. But
Nancy Koster, vice president of Minnesota Citizens Concerned for
Life, said the foundation's review of its decision will ``make a
lot of pro-life people unhappy and Dayton's will hear about it.''

   Pope John Paul II on Saturday called for
a narrowing of the gap between Africa's urban elite and rural poor
and urged peasants in this infertile nation to redouble efforts to
improve the quality of their lives.
   Later, the military government announced a general amnesty to
mark John Paul's visit and said it will cover all prisoners except
those sentenced for ``political crimes and corruption against the
state.''
   The announcement broadcast on state radio said prisoners facing
the death penalty will have their sentences commuted to life
imprisonment. Life sentences will be reduced to 20 years, and
sentences of 10 to 20 years will be halved.
   Prisoners jailed for 10 years or less and all women and
prisoners under the age of 18 will be freed, the announcement said.
It was not immediately known how many prisoners will be affected.
   In his speech, John Paul said Rwandan peasants, who comprise
more than 80 percent of the population of 7 million, have the right
to demand the same health, social and administrative facilities,
including credit banking, as their urban counterparts.
   ``It is necessary to avoid widening the inequalities between the
town and the countryside,'' he said.
   The message in French was broadcast on state radio as John
Paul's motorcade traveled to the small agricultural center of
Kabgayi, 40 miles southwest of the capital, Kigali. Thousands of
peasants gathered in shaded banana groves near villages along the
route to see him. Many held small radios to their ears.
   John Paul told listeners he believed the international community
was duty-bound ``to contribute to the development of the peasant
world.''
   ``Development projects must not deviate from their objectives or
lose sight that they are for the peasants,'' John Paul said.
   He said industrialized nations should pay a just price for
primary produce from poor nations, as well as provide humanitarian
aid when conditions are worsened by famine, drought or man-made
calamity.
   This year scores of people have died in a drought that hit
remote southern Rwanda.
   On Sunday, John Paul leaves Kigali for the Ivory Coast, the last
stop on a 10-day, four-nation African tour that has also taken him
to Burundi and Tanzania.
   A senior Vatican official traveling with the pope welcomed the
announcement of the amnesty.
   Maj. Gen. Juvenal Habyarimana seized power in a bloodless coup
in 1973. His government has been praised for its moderate
pro-Western policies but has cracked down on internal dissent.
   John Paul met with civil servants and academics Saturday and
commended the government for maintaining civil harmony and good
relations between church and state.
   Later, he repeated his warnings about the danger of AIDS in this
nation at the heart of the so-called AIDS belt across central
Africa. He blamed sexual permissiveness for the epidemic and urged
self-control.
   ``Fidelity and chastity, which are part of Christian marriage,
reinforce self-control,'' he told a gathering of 25,000 young
people at the Amahoro stadium in Kigali.
   During his African visit, John Paul has visited AIDS sufferers
but has reaffirmed the church's opposition to the use of condoms to
prevent the disease.
   In Africa, AIDS is spread mainly through heterosexual contact.
As many as 40 percent of young urban adults in some areas of
central Africa may be infected with the AIDS virus, according to
official estimates.

<TEXT>
   Americans may be misled and endangered by
scientists' misconduct and conflicts of interest in federally
funded medical research, according to a congressional report to be
released Monday.
   The report by the House Government Operations Committee charges
that federal health officials have few safeguards to discourage
scientists from manipulating research on products in which they
have a financial interest.
   Based on a three-year investigation by the committee's human
resources and intergovernmental relations subcommittee, the report
reviews 10 cases of alleged scientific misconduct at universities
that receive Public Health Service funds.
   The report, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press
over the weekend, focuses on two parts of the Public Health
Service: the National Institutes of Health; and the Alcohol, Drug
Abuse and Mental Health Administration.
   It charges that the universities conducted inadequate
investigations of possible misconduct and retaliated against
whistleblowers. It also says NIH officials usually accepted the
findings of the university and ignored financial conflicts of
interest among scientists who receive federal grants.
   In one case, at least 13 researchers who were evaluating a heart
drug owned stock or held stock options in the company that
developed it. NIH was funding research trials of the drug.
   ``In all of these cases, the ownership of the stock or options
could have created a conflict of interest for individuals who
received federal funds to study'' whether the drug was safe and
effective, the report said.
   ``The reporting of misleading research results poses an obvious
danger to the public,'' the report said. ``In addition, the policy
of some universities to make no announcements about their findings
of misconduct is also a source of potential danger to the public''
because these scientists can resign quietly and move to another job
where their work won't be monitored carefully.
   The Public Health Service, which is part of the Department of
Health and Human Services, said in a statement that officials could
not comment on the report because they had not seen it.
   However, the statement noted that officials have been drafting
conflict-of-interest guidelines. It said officials ``wish to assure
the public that any use of public funds for research will be done
in a quality way.''
   Currently, most universities do not limit the amount of money
their faculty may accept for research, honoraria, travel,
consulting fees or gifts from drug companies, the report said.
   Also NIH has no restrictions on conflicts of interest for
outside researchers who get federal funds, though it requires grant
recipients to list all sources of funding for research projects
when they apply for NIH funds, the report said. NIH officials also
must approve outside financial arrangements that could pose a
conflict for NIH employees, it said.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., subcommittee chairman, said in comments
included in the report that current Public Health Service proposals
to protect against conflict of interest would merely ``maintain the
status quo.''
   Lawmakers recommended adoption of regulations restricting
honoraria, consulting fees, stocks, equity and other conflicts of
interest for scientists receiving federal health research. They
also recommend legislation to protect whistleblowers.
   Seven Republicans on the committee faulted the ``factual
accuracy'' of the report and said that while most of the cases had
come under subcommittee scrutiny in hearings, a few of the cases
were investigated without the knowledge of Republicans on the panel.
   The Republicans also disagreed with one of the committee's
recommendations, saying that restricting outside financial ties
``could force qualified, honest researchers to turn away from
federally sponsored projects.''
   A better way to reduce incentives for manipulating research is
through ``stringent enforcement of existing disclosure
requirements,'' they said.

   Huge cartoons lampooning Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein were removed from public view Saturday in preparation for a
historic visit by an Iraq's foreign minister, who was expected to
ask Iran to break the U.N. economic embargo.
   Officials declined to comment on the visit Sunday by Tariq Aziz.
He will be the first high-ranking Iraqi visitor to Iran since 1980,
when the Iran-Iraq war broke out.
   Iraq is increasingly feeling the pinch of U.N. economic
sanctions imposed after it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Since the
embargo, it has made concessions to Iran, including promising to
withdraw from Iranian territory seized in the last days of the war.
   Iraq also agreed to Tehran's demand that the frontier between
the two countries should run along the middle of the Shatt al-Arab
waterway. Iraq had long demanded that it have full control of the
waterway.
   Aziz will return to Iraq ``with his hands full'' if Iraq
continues its policy toward Iran, said an editorial in Saturday's
editions of Tehran's Jomhuri Islami.
   Foreign observers speculated that Aziz would bring ``concrete
proposals'' for ending the territorial dispute that sparked the
Iran-Iraq war.
   One Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Aziz probably would present a way to enforce a 1975 treaty that
split the Shatt-al-Arab waterway between Iran and Iraq.
   Such a plan ``would be vitally important because it would
represent a de facto peace treaty between Baghdad and Tehran,'' the
diplomat said.
   Walls along roads leading to Tehran's Mehrabad Airport have been
covered with huge cartoons depicting Saddam Hussein as a war monger
and a U.S. stooge throwing bombs at Iranian children. But they were
being painted over Saturday.
   Where the walls could not be whitewashed, painters, who
reportedly started work earlier in the week, settled for smudging
up the caricatures.
   Another indication that Iran could be willing to negotiate with
its former adversary was an editorial in Saturday's Keyhan
International proclaiming that the ``American game plan (in the
gulf is) at odds with world peace.''
   ``Essentially, the present Iraq-Kuwait crisis is being exploited
by Washington's regional ambitions in the name of the U.N.,'' it
said.
   An Iranian newspaper close to President Hashemi Rafsanjani on
Thursday raised the question of sending food and medicine to Iraq.
   ``Should the Islamic republic help the Iraqi Moslem people in
these hard times when they are facing an economic blockade?'' asked
the editorial in the English-language Tehran Times.
   ``Since food and medicine are not included in the sanctions so
far imposed on Iraq, by choosing to help the Iraqi people Iran will
not be breaching any international law,'' the editorial said.

<HEAD>Spate of Palestinian Attacks on Accused Collaborators</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Masked Palestinian assailants gunned down an
Arab man and hacked to death an Arab woman in weekend attacks on
alleged collaborators in the occupied lands, Arab and Israeli
sources said Saturday.
   The violence underscored the inward turn taken lately by the
nearly 34-month-old Palestinian rebellion against Israeli rule.
Most uprising victims since June have been Arabs slain by Arabs.
Prior to that, most were Arabs killed by Israeli soldiers during
stone-throwing protests.
   Palestinian sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said
masked activists abducted the woman, identified as Etas Anims, 45,
from her home in Rafah in the Gaza Strip on Friday night.
   Her body was found in a Rafah street on Saturday, riddled with
dagger and ax wounds. An arm and leg had been hacked off, the
Palestinian reports said.
   Graffiti scribbled on walls in Rafah accused Ms. Anims of
collaborating with Israel. She had been beaten four times in the
past by activists for similar accusations, the Palestinian reports
said.
   In the Magazi refugee camp in Gaza, masked assailants ambushed
Fahmi Mohammed Sayed Abu Libda, 34, on Friday night and fatally
shot him in the head, the reports said.
   Abu Libda, also accused by uprising activists of collaborating
with Israel, arrived dead at Shifa Hospital, hospital officials
said. A military source confirmed Abu Libda's death and was
checking the other report.
   The deaths raised to 258 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs during the uprising against Israeli rule of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Most have been accused of helping Israel or of
dealing in drugs or prostitution.
   Another 728 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during the
rebellion, which began on Dec. 8, 1987. Fifty-one Israelis and
foreign tourists have been slain during the unrest.
   Palestinian violence against accused collaborators has risen
dramatically in the last three months as activists have tried to
eliminate informants suspected of sabotaging their rebellion.
   The attacks have persisted despite calls by PLO leaders to stop
the slayings.
   Since June, 42 alleged collaborators have been killed, compared
with 14 Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians in the
same period.
   The decline in shooting deaths by Israeli troops is largely a
result of attempts to calm the atmosphere by pulling many soldiers
out of trouble spots.
   The army also has turned to other punitive measures to curb
stoning attacks, such as more curfews and closing more businesses.
   On Friday the military took the unusual step of closing eight
stretches of West Bank highway from one to two miles in length,
during the night, to prevent stoning and firebomb attacks, the
national Itim news agency reported.
   Soldiers also shut down a marketplace in Gaza City on Saturday
after activists blocked a road with boulders, and they closed a
vegetable market in Bethlehem following a stoning assault, Arab
reports said.

   Crises such as the one in the Persian
Gulf should not be allowed to thwart better superpower ties, Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Saturday on arriving to meet
President Bush.
   Gorbachev planned to assure Bush in their meetings on Sunday
that he will continue efforts to force Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait
and to conclude conventional and nuclear arms control pacts by
yearend, said top U.S. and Soviet officials.
   He was also seeking assurances from Bush that the administration
will press for Senate ratification of a new trade pact with Moscow,
and for other assistance to help the Soviet Union through its own
time of economic and political crisis at home.
   Gorbachev has backed U.S. initiatives in the U.N. Security
Council to condemn the Iraqi invasion and approve military means to
enforce sanctions against Iraq.
   But so far he has balked at sending Soviet ground or naval
forces to support the U.N. effort in the gulf. Nor has he recalled
193 Soviet military experts on contract to train Iraqi forces.
   Soviet spokesmen say the experts did not take part in the
invasion, but Bush is almost certain to seek further clarification
from Gorbachev.
   It remained to be seen whether Gorbachev and Bush agreed to the
hastily called one-day summit in Finland in order to announce some
previously undisclosed deal concerning the Persian Gulf.
   One Soviet official said of Gorbachev, ``If the president has
agreed to such an urgent meeting, he must have something in his
pocket.'' The official, who spoke on condition he not be further
identified, declined to indicate what sort of deal _ if any _ might
be in the works.
   Gorbachev's presidential Ilyushin-62M touched down at the
Helsinki airport Saturday night, nearly eight hours after Bush.
   In his arrival statement, he made clear the initiative for the
meeting lay with the Americans.
   ``President George Bush expressed a wish for us to meet at this
crucial moment in history, when it is important to compare
political approaches, and to cooperate and protect the positive
trends that are developing in the world today _ and to make sure
that they are not thwarted by any development,'' he said.
   ``It is important for us to meet personally, although we have
been in touch through various means,'' including telephone calls
and letters, he said.
   ``It is necessary to meet in order to discuss the acute crisis
in the Persian Gulf and other issues,'' he said in remarks that
were translated at the arrival from Russian into English _ but not
into Finnish.
   Gorbachev looked relaxed, despite a host of domestic troubles
that threaten the economy and structure of the Soviet Union.
   As he flew toward Helsinki, Radio Moscow quoted parliamentary
leaders saying that the nation might drop the word socialist from
its formal name _ changing from the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics to the Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics.
   The change would reflect declarations of independence or
sovereignty by more than half of the 15 Soviet republics, including
Russia, the largest.
   A key Gorbachev ally in Moscow, Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov,
also said Saturday that a prospective compromise on economic reform
had fallen through with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who
advocates a more radical transition to a market economy.
   Faced with possible approval of Yeltsin's radical reform package
by the parliament of the Russian Federation early next week,
Gorbachev dropped plans to present his own version to the national
parliament on Monday or Tuesday.
   Instead, Lukyanov told a news conference in Moscow, Gorbachev
will circulate his plans to the Soviet republics before presenting
it to the national legislature. The announcement indicated that
Gorbachev was losing the domestic initiative to Yeltsin.

<HEAD>Nordstrom Stores Announce Cutbacks, Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nordstrom clothing store chain is cutting
costs and laying off employees because of a drop in profits.
   The cutbacks will vary between 3 percent and 12 percent at each
Nordstrom store depending on the stores' performance, spokesman
Dave Marriott said Friday from the company's Seattle headquarters.
   Nordstrom, a chain known for its blue-chip customer service,
employs about 30,000 people in 61 stores in seven states.
   The cuts will be determined by store managers and could include
trimming staff, advertising budgets and inventory, Marriott said.
   Nordstrom profits have declined from the previous year for three
consecutive quarters. For the three-month period that ended July
31, Nordstrom profits of $35.9 million were down 7 percent from the
$38.5 million reported for the same quarter of 1989.
   Despite a slowdown in sales, Nordstrom is continuing its
national expansion program. It opened a new store Friday in
Paramus, N.J., and another in August in Santa Barbara, Calif.
   Nordstrom has been embroiled for about a year in a labor dispute
with the union representing many of its workers, who charged they
were pressured into working overtime without pay. The company
recently signed an agreement with the National Labor Relations
Board to resolve some of the issues.
   Marriott said the cost-cutting moves were unrelated to those
problems.

   The Soviet Union may drop the word ``Socialist''
from its formal name, according to a top official quoted by Radio
Moscow on Saturday.
   The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, or U.S.S.R., might
become the Union of Sovereign Soviet Republics, the broadcast said,
quoting parliamentary leader Rafik Nishanov.
   Proposals to drop ``Socialist'' indicate the depth of change in
the country, where less than six months ago the Communist Party
held a constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power.
   The use addition of the word ``Sovereign'' would be aimed at
placating republics seeking independence or more autonomy.
   A second variation on the U.S.S.R. initials calls for
``Sovereign'' to replace ``Soviet,'' a term disliked by nationalist
movements in some republics. The full title of the nation could be
``Union of Sovereign Socialist States,'' the radio broadcast said.
   Nishanov said a name change might be approved as part of a new
union treaty, which is expected to redefine the country as
something between a federation and an economic alliance. Action on
the union treaty is expected before the end of the year.
   Democratic reforms have led to official name changes in other
countries. Last year, both Hungary and Poland dropped the word
``People's'' from their names to become the Republic of Hungary and
Republic of Poland.
   In January, Czeckoslovakian President Vaclav Havel proposed
dropping the word ``Socialist'' from the country's formal name.

<HEAD>EC Sees Strict Monetary Policies As Best Reaction to Oil Price
Surge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finance ministers of the 12 Economic Community
nations agreed Saturday that restrictive budget and monetary
policies are the best way to react to the recent surge in world oil
prices.
   At a one-day meeting here, they also agreed that governments
should react according to the conditions in their own countries,
said Italian Treasury Minister Guido Carli.
   Carli, the meeting's chairman, said the EC countries should be
able to prevent widespread inflation following the oil price surge
by controlling consumer demand.
   Oil prices have soared nearly 50 percent _ to about $30 a barrel
_ since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 and the subsequent U.N.
trade embargo imposed on Iraq. The price rise occurred despite a
decision by OPEC nations to raise production.
   ``Budget and monetary policies should be restrictive according
to the conditions found in individual countries,'' Carli told
reporters.
   He also said governments should seek to keep savings rates, and
thus investment rates, high. He said investment, rather than
consumption, should fuel EC economic growth in the face of rising
energy costs.

Personality</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   This north Florida city regained the
feel of a typical college town Saturday as attention shifted from
the killings of five college students to the football stadium.
   Reports surfaced that an 18-year-old freshman who is a suspect
in the case may have multiple personalities ranging from a
knife-wielding Rambo type to a mixed-up college kid.
   An estimated 70,000 fans crowded into Ben Hill Griffin Stadium
for the opener for the University of Florida Gators, who were
playing the Oklahoma State Cowboys.
   Fear and tension were temporarily replaced by traditional
tailgate parties, boisterous fans and gridiron competition.
   ``This football game was needed,'' said William Stebbins, a
Florida alumnus from Jacksonville, who said he had missed only
three home games since 1951. ``All the students need something to
reduce the tension and stress.''
   But the search for a killer continued.
   Sources close to the investigation have told The Florida
Times-Union that suspect Edward Lewis Humphrey, an 18-year-old
University of Florida freshman, has admitted having knowledge of
the first two killings, discovered two weeks ago.
   Humphrey, in an interview with investigators last week, named
someone he said had killed Christina Powell, 17, and Sonja Larson,
18. Their bodies were discovered Aug. 26 in their Gainesville
townhouse.
   Investigators believe the person Humphrey named is one of his
multiple personalities, the newspaper reported. Both his lawyer and
police had no comment on the report.
   A source familiar with the case said Humphrey's personality
sometimes resembles that of a knife-wielding killer, and at other
times a emotionally troubled college student.
   Humphrey takes the anti-depressant drug lithium to control mood
swings.
   Police have repeatedly said that Humphrey, being held in the
Brevard County Jail in lieu of $1 million bond for allegedly
beating his grandmother, is one of eight suspects and they have
refused to characterize him as the prime suspect.
   At a hearing Thursday in Sharpes, Emily Glaab, a Brevard County
jail guard, said Humphrey sometimes referred to himself as ``John.''
   The guard quoted Humphrey as saying: ``John doesn't take no
prisoners.''
   Humphrey's lawyer, public defender J.R. Russo, said he was
unaware of any such statements by his client.
   ``It's news to me,'' Russo said.
   He noted, however, that police had grilled his client without
attorneys present.
   So far, authorities have refused to discuss publicly what
Humphrey has told them.
   ``We are not going to be able to speak to what information we
have gained in interviews with suspects,'' Gainesville Police Lt.
Sadie Darnell said Saturday. ``We are still working around the
clock and following up leads, but as far was we can tell, there
will be no new developments this weekend.''
   Police said late last week they had found promising evidence
during searches of Humphrey's Gainesville apartment, his car and
his grandmother's home in Indialantic, a coastal city about 180
miles southeast of Gainesville.
   Police also have continued to pursue other leads, both in
Florida and elsewhere.
   Besides the Brevard County charge, Humphrey has been charged in
Indian River County with armed burglary and attempted sexual
battery and with aggravated assault in Gainesville.
   Memories of the killings were likely to return after the game,
said Joe Fincher, owner of the Gator Shop.
   ``It's just a football game,'' he said. ``The extra people who
came into town will be gone tomorrow and nothing will have
changed.''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alfredo Cristiani has
testified before a court investigating the murders of six Jesuit
priests, a case that has strained relations with the United States,
a government official said Saturday.
   Information Minister Mauricio Sandoval said in a telephone
interview that Cristiani testified Friday.
   Sandoval said he did not have further details, and that he did
not know if Cristiani testified in his capacity as commander in
chief of the armed forces.
   Nine members of the armed forces, including a colonel and three
lesser officers, have been charged in the murder of the priests,
their housekeeper and her daughter last Nov. 16.
   The massacre occurred during a period of tight army security
imposed during a major rebel offensive.
   Some U.S. congressmen have threatened to seek cuts in aid to the
Salvadoran military because of alleged army efforts to cover up the
killings and to block the investigation.
   Local radio station YSU reported that Cristiani testified before
criminal court Judge Ricardo Zamora for more than two hours.
   It quoted the president as saying he testified to ``give an
example and so that other witnesses will appear to testify before
the judge.''
   The broadcast did not include Cristiani's voice, nor did it give
details of his testimony.
   Other military officials have given only written testimony.
   According to court spokesman Mario Gonzalez, Cristiani was not
on the list of those who had been called to testify.

<TEXT>
   A tourist slain in a New York City subway was
remembered Saturday as a competitive and fun-loving young man who
loved helping others.
   The funeral for Brian Watkins, 22, at the Mormon Church's Provo
North Stake Center was attended by about 300 people.
   ``I suppose there could be no greater epitaph on a tombstone
than `He was trying to help his mother.' Somewhere in the heart and
breast and soul of Brian there was a giant,'' said Michael R. Hill,
Watkins' former Mormon lay bishop.
   Watkins was fatally stabbed Sunday when he tried to defend his
mother from a band of teen-agers who robbed his father in a
Manhattan subway station. The family from Provo, Utah, had made
their annual trip to New York to attend the U.S. Open tennis
tournament.
   ``New York is shocked, Provo is shocked and so is the nation. We
have witnessed a real live hero,'' Hill said at the funeral.
   Watkins was buried later at the Provo City Cemetery. After a
graveside service, his mother, Karen, plucked two yellow roses from
atop the casket, and gave one to her 10-year-old daughter, Emily.
   Watkins attended Idaho State University for three years on a
tennis scholarship and was working as a seminar director for
American Business Seminars. He aspired to be a prosecuting attorney.
   He planned to work as an intern to Sen. Steven D. Symms,
R-Idaho, in Washington next January before returning to college and
attending law school.
   Brian's 26-year-old brother, Todd, who was in the subway that
night, said: ``Brian always had a competitive spirit inside him. .
. . He did whatever was necessary so he could come out on top.''
   And yet, he said, his brother had a tender side.
   ``Brian grew to become a very compassionate human being. He
loved his family . . . Brian loved helping others and he died doing
just that,'' Todd Watkins said.
   No mention was made of the eight young men accused in Watkin's
slaying. They have been charged with second-degree murder and
related robbery counts and are jailed pending a Sept. 24 bond
hearing.
   Police said the gang wanted the money to pay for a night of
drinking and dancing at a nightclub where several suspects were
arrested.
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau promised Watkins'
parents the defendants won't be offered a plea bargain.
   On Friday, Watkin's parents spoke about their son.
   ``If there was something he wanted, he worked for it,'' Sherwin
Watkins told The Deseret News. ``I think that was one of Brian's
strong points.''
   Watkins and his family had traveled extensively in the United
States, Europe and Israel.
   ``He wasn't intimidated by any place. He wasn't a typical
22-year-old who hadn't been somewhere,'' the father said. ``He
didn't lead a sheltered life. We always traveled. He liked to
travel _ the excitement of being in different places.''

   Rain was scattered from the southern Plains into the Ohio Valley
on Saturday, and temperatures fell from the Great Lakes into New
England.
   Showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered along a
stationary front from northwestern Texas through Arkansas and
Missouri to Kentucky during the afternoon.
   A few showers and thunderstorms also were scattered in
southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana.
   Late Friday and early Saturday, severe thunderstorms developed
along a stationary front from Nebraska and Kansas to North
Carolina, Virginia and Maryland.
   Temperatures rose into the 90s across much of the southern tier
of states, with some midday readings above 100 in the desert
Southwest, and temperatures in the lower 90s were also reported
over parts of the northern and central Plains.
   But cool air spread from the upper Mississippi Valley to New
England, where where afternoon temperatures were only in the 50s
and 60s.
   Overnight readings in that region dipped into the 40s and 50s,
with lows in the 30s reported in Upper Michigan, northern Lower
Michigan, upstate New York, and northern New England.
   Worcester, Mass., equalled its record low for the date at 43.
   Lows also were in the 40s in the Rockies and the Great Basin,
which includes Nevada and western Utah.
   Saturday's low for the Lower 48 was 32 at Watertown, N.Y.

   The New Faith Singers, a promising group
of gospel music singers, has won the go-ahead for a record album on
a major label, but the group won't be taking its act on the road
anytime soon.
   The New Faith Singers are serving life sentences at the
Tennessee State Penitentiary. The group plans to complete its first
LP for Warner Bros. Records this week.
   ``This really hasn't all sunk in, but it looks like this is
God's little pet project,'' New Faith member Malika Haki said in an
interview from prison.
   ``Because of their dedication, there's every reason to think
there is a high potential for commercial success,'' said Jim Ed
Norman, president of Warner's Nashville division.
   The New Faith Singers grew out of a Bible study group that Moses
Dillard started during a prison ministry in 1987. Dillard, a
musician, songwriter and minister, is the group's co-producer along
with Jesse Boyce.
   ``I was so impressed with the first four tracks, I said let's go
with the next step, which is finishing an album,'' Norman said.
``Then we'll have to evaluate just how to go about a marketing
strategy.''

   Dirt-encrusted hand grenades spilled from a
broken box in a U.S. Postal Service bulk mail center Saturday,
forcing a three-hour evacuation, authorities said.
   ``They were live,'' said police bomb squad Sgt. Robert Garrison.
``They were very badly deteriorated. We considered them unsafe for
storage.''
   Bomb squad officers hand-carried the 19 grenades and an
artillery shell, believed to be of World War I vintage, out of the
building. The weapons were taken to a disposal site and detonated,
Garrison said.
   The box also contained empty bottles, a mess kit, military-style
leggings and two boxes of French cookies, Garrison said.
   The box had been mailed from France to an address in
Chambersburg, police said. It fell off a conveyor belt and broke
open shortly before 7 a.m. Employees were allowed to return about
10 a.m., police said.
   ``The package broke loose, and they saw that there were
explosives and what looked like explosives, and they called the
bomb squad,'' he said.
   Postal Inspection Service investigators were trying to locate
the sender and the intended recipient, police said.
   Postal inspectors contacted by telephone refused to answer
questions.

<HEAD>Talks on Economic, Monetary Union Stall</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts to achieve economic and monetary union
within the European Community hit a snag Saturday in disagreements
among the 12 member states over when and how union should be
accomplished.
   At a one-day session, the EC finance ministers reached no accord
on a timetable for moving toward a single currency and central bank
patterned after the U.S. Federal Reserve.
   They met with only three months before the final negotiations on
monetary union are to take place. The ministers agreed to meet
again here in November.
   The final talks, due to open in December, must produce
amendments to the EC's 1957 founding Treaty of Rome to bring about
monetary union.
   The meeting was a boost for British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, who opposes a single EC currency and an EC central bank.
Some EC nations have expressed support Britain's alternative
proposals for monetary union.
   Supporters of a single currency and a central bank _ notably
France, Belgium and Italy _ had hoped Saturday's meeting would put
the final touches on preparatory work for the start of the December
talks.
   The EC's drive for monetary union is a complex, three-stage
journey.
   The first stage began July 1 and the EC nations now are more
closely coordinating their economic and monetary policies.
   Also, all EC currencies, notably the British pound, will join
the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism. The pound,
the Greek drachma and the Portuguese escudo are not in the ERM now.
   On Saturday, several nations rejected a proposal by the EC
executive Commission that the second stage _ during which the EC
would create a central bank _ begin on Jan. 1, 1993.
   West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, and Portugal argued that
before the second stage begins, the EC nations must first narrow
the gaps between their inflation, unemployment and interest rates.
   ``There was a long discussion about the moment at which you must
go to phase two. There are difficulties there,'' said Dutch Finance
Minister Wim Kok.
   Under the EC Commission's proposal, in the third and final stage
of monetary union the nations would permanently fix exchange rates
among their currencies. These eventually would be replaced by a
single currency known as the ``European currency unit,'' or ECU.
   Spanish Finance Minister Carlos Solchaga Saturday proposed that
a single currency not be created until the year 2000.
   He described his proposal as a compromise between Britain _
which prefers the retain the 12 EC currencies plus a ``hard ECU'' _
and the EC Commission's monetary package.
   But Solchaga's plan ran into opposition from West German Central
Bank President Karl Otto Poehl, who said, ``I am very much against
it. I cannot see many merits'' in a parallel currency.

<HEAD>Dukakis Staff Assesses Insurgent's Plans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' staff will assess the
budget-cutting proposals unveiled by his rebellious lieutenant
governor, but some observers said Saturday her plan won't solve the
state's fiscal troubles.
   Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy seized command as acting governor after
Dukakis left the state on a European trade mission, and on Friday
she issued her own program.
   But Dukakis' staff is still carrying out the orders he issued
before he left Thursday.
   Murphy, needing some life in her lagging campaign for governor,
had raised expectations about her proposals by refusing to disclose
them as long as Dukakis was still in Massachusetts. She said she
was waiting for the former Democratic presidential candidate to
leave so she could assume authority.
   She will face two other opponents in the Sept. 18 Democratic
primary, and public opinion polls put her well behind. Dukakis,
whose popularity has dived, is not seeking re-election.
   Among Murphy's steps were cutting management positions in each
cabinet secretariat by 25 percent, as well as slashing by 10
percent the payroll of the Department of Administration and Finance.
   Murphy said her proposals would save up to $150 million
annually. Earlier in the week, Dukakis had ordered cabinet
secretaries to find $150 million worth of cuts for the current
fiscal year.
   Dukakis refused to comment on her proposals Saturday. ``I've got
a very good team in place (at home) and I want to get on with this
trip,'' he said in Bitterfeld, East Germany.
   Dukakis administration officials said Murphy's numbers were
misleading, and that her plan would realistically save only about
$17 million this fiscal year.
   ``In terms of real dollar savings, it doesn't match up to the
$125 million to $150 million which she says it is,'' said Stephen
Crawford, a Dukakis spokesman.
   ``For people looking to an end to this yearlong nightmare, I
don't think we saw it yesterday,'' said James Braude, head of the
Tax Equity Alliance for Massachusetts, a group that has supported
higher taxes to help solve the state's fiscal woes.
   Crawford said the governor's staff would assess Murphy's plans
over the next week. Dukakis is scheduled to return Friday.
   Dukakis had said he might cut his trip short if any action
Murphy took threatened to hurt the state's stability. But after
Murphy issued her orders, Crawford said he saw no reason for the
governor to return early.
   He noted that executive orders requiring payroll cuts would not
take effect before Dukakis comes back, since such actions take 10
days to implement. Once the governor returns, he can rescind
Murphy's action, but Crawford could not predict what action Dukakis
might take.
   Murphy's orders do not supersede the instructions Dukakis issued
earlier in the week to make cuts, which means cabinet secretaries
will still carry out those plans, Crawford said.
   A spokesman for the Executive Office of Human Services said his
agency would proceed with the spending cuts ordered by Dukakis.
   ``The secretary's strong position is that he works for Mike
Dukakis,'' said Kenneth Schwartz, chief of staff for Human Services
Secretary Philip Johnston.
   Mark Longabaugh, a spokesman for the lieutenant governor, said
Saturday that she stands behind her savings projections.
   One element of her plan did not receive as much as attention as
the payroll cuts, he said, but was highly important. That order
would require the department of Administration and Finance to
submit monthly budget reports, documenting whether the state's
books are in balance.
   Cabinet secretaries who fail to remedy their deficits could lose
part of their salaries and possibly their jobs.
   While Murphy has downplayed the political aspects of her action,
saying she was simply looking out for the state's well-being,
Longabaugh acknowledged her supporters believe the campaign has
gained ground from the episode.
   ``From a political standpoint, she looked like a leader, she
looked like she was ready to act,'' he said.

   A gunman who caused panic by firing shots from
the top of a high-rise before shooting himself and falling to the
ground, was a shy man discouraged because the Navy had rejected
him, friends said.
   Paul Fisher was ``a real good guy who had a lot of personal
problems,'' said Dennis Byrd, owner of Thirsty's Restaurant &amp;
Saloon, where Fisher was a regular.
   Fisher, 35, held police at bay for 5{ hours Friday from the
rooftop of a 16-story apartment building in one of the city's
busiest sections. He fired at least 11 shots in the air from a
.22-caliber rifle.
   After pleading with police to kill him, Fisher shot himself with
a .25-caliber handgun and plunged to the street.
   Police found a suicide note in Fisher's wallet, but said they
had not immediately determined why he killed himself.
   Byrd said Fisher, a Navy reservist, was depressed because he
wanted to join the regular Navy but failed to meet a weight
requirement.
   Fisher spent the summer trying to lose weight, Byrd said.
   ``He got disgruntled with being a computer operator and wanted
to try for a full-time job with the Navy,'' Byrd said. ``Then when
he had to deal with that rejection from the Navy, I think that
probably had something to do with what happened. That must have
been working and working on him.''
   ``He was really bummed out about it,'' said David Dietz, another
acquaintance who said he talked with Fisher about seven hours
before Fisher opened fire from the roof of the building near the
University of Pittsburgh.
   Byrd described Fisher as a shy bachelor who spent most of his
evenings and days off at the bar.
   ``He was never an extrovert on the bar scene _ he was just a joy
to have around,'' Byrd said. ``We were his extended family, and he
was quiet, pleasant and generous with us. If someone needed money
for their rent, Paul would loan it to them. If he came into some
money, he'd buy drinks for the house.''
   The Navy permits people whose applications are rejected to file
written objections, but Fisher did not do that, said Cmdr. John
Wells, head of the Naval and Marine Corps Reserve Centers in
Pittsburgh.
   ``When that situation came up, he didn't indicate a preference
to stay,'' Wells said. ``He did not demonstrate a particularly
gung-ho attitude.''

<TEXT>
   Bush administration and
congressional budget negotiators continued their stretch-drive
search Saturday for about $50 billion in tax increases and spending
cuts for next year, but there were no signs of major progress.
   The two sides swapped new offers Saturday, the second day of
revived budget talks at Andrews Air Force Base just outside
Washington.
   On Friday, each side proposed trimming about $50 billion from
next year's deficit, but Republicans sought deeper cuts in domestic
programs and Democrats wanted to rely more on defense reductions
and revenue increases.
   Democrats offered Saturday to seek only about $13 billion in
defense cuts instead of the $14.9 billion they had suggested
Friday, one official said. But Republicans, who want to pare
military spending by just $4 billion, dismissed the offer as
inadequate, the official said.
   Another official, speaking on condition he not be identified,
said Democrats proposed a 10 percent surcharge on income taxes of
people earning more than $500,000 annually.
   They have also proposed a wide range of energy levies, including
a 7-cent-a-gallon boost in the 9-cent federal gasoline tax. Half
the increase would be to reduce the deficit and half to build new
roads and bridges, the official said.
   One source close to the talks, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he believed the bargaining ``could be on the verge
of breaking up'' because Democrats were making excessive demands
for new taxes, defense slashes and for increases in some domestic
programs.
   Other officials, however, said there were no indications of any
problems beyond the usual disagreements between bargainers.
   As the negotiators met, about 25 federal employee union
officials and government workers staged an hour-long demonstration
outside the gates of the air base.
   They were protesting the furloughs of tens of thousands of
federal workers that could occur should the negotiators fail to
complete a budget deal by Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year.
   Should the deficit not be reduced by that day, the Gramm-Rudman
law will automatically reduce the $1.2 trillion federal budget by
about $100 billion. Agencies are threatening to give many of their
workers up to 22 days of unpaid leave to make up the shortfall.
   ``We're tired of being jerked around as a political football,''
said John Sturdivant, president of the American Federation of
Government Employees, the largest union for federal workers.
   Meanwhile, the negotiators further tightened the restrictions on
reporters covering the budget talks.
   From the start, journalists have been restricted to a press
center about two miles from the Andrews officers' club where the
talks are under way.
   Beginning Saturday, they were permitted to enter the base or
leave the press center only with an armed military escort. In
either case, they were driven directly to their destinations with
no detours permitted.
   ``Just want to make sure nobody's bothering anybody at the
O.C.,'' or officers' club, one Air Force official said.

   American-born Queen Noor of Jordan
visited a squalid camp housing tens of thousands of Asian refugees
Saturday, offering them words of comfort and appealing for aid to
get them home.
   Everywhere she stopped, Noor was surrounded by Bangladeshi,
Pakistani and Indian men and women shouting at her: ``Please help
us. We have no food, no water, you are our only hope.''
   The queen shook hands and assured the refugees who were left
penniless after fleeing Iraqi-occupied Kuwait: ``We are doing
everything possible to get you home.''
   At one point, a mother shoved her baby in front of the queen,
sobbing: ``You are a mother, my child is dying, please help us.''
   The queen, who was accompanied by Jordanian Health Minister
Mohamed Azeben, immediately asked him to take the mother and child
to the desert camp's medical tent.
   ``Don't worry, we are coming with you to the hospital,'' Noor
told the mother, stretching out her manicured hand to wipe the
tears from the bedraggled woman's cheeks.
   Noor, the former Lisa Halaby, the Lebanese-American daughter of
an airline executive, has been married to Jordan's King Hussein
since 1978.
   Official estimates say more than 250,000 foreigners, mostly
Asians, have crossed the desert border post at Ruweishid since the
Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Jordan's meager resources are inadequate to provide food,
shelter and transportation for the more than 100,000 refugees
stranded in camps along its desert border.
   The queen, who arrived by helicopter, flew twice low over the
Shalaan I camp, housing more than 40,000 refugees in a square mile
of arid desert near the Ruweishid border post, 200 miles northeast
of the Jordanian capital, Amman.
   After viewing the hundreds of makeshift shelters set up to keep
out the desert sun _ ranging from tents to colored women's saris
tied to sticks _ Noor drove her four-wheel-drive Mercedes through
the camp.
   She stopped more than a dozen times, getting out of the car to
mingle with refugees and walk through the dusty, litter-strewn
passages between the rows of tents.
   ``We understand how you feel, you are not forgotten,'' Noor kept
saying to the crowds pressing around her.
   Dressed in a blue shirt and ankle-length khaki skirt over brown
boots, the queen stood out amid the unkempt refugees.
   An elderly Indian woman who found herself next to the queen in
the crush asked: ``Who are you?''
   ``I've just come from Amman,'' Noor replied as the minister next
to her informed the Indian she was the queen.
   ``God bless you!'' the woman blurted, overwhelmed by the
realization she had spoken with the queen.
   One bearded man acting as spokesman for a large group said in
broken English: ``Maximum people are suffering. No food, no water,
day and night, terrible heat and terrible cold. We unable to sleep
at night with thought what will happen to us.''
   ``Be patient, be courageous, we will get you home,'' Noor
responded.
   ``We have courage, but for God's sake, get bus home,'' countered
the man.
   An airlift operation for Indians got under way Saturday, with
Indians flying from Amman to Dubai, where Indian Air Force
transports are carrying them home.
   In Amman, officials from the Middle East Council of Churches met
with Noor and others involved in relief efforts.
   Gabriel Habib, the council's general secretary, called for
governments to intensify efforts to airlift the refugees to their
home countries, saying their situation was becoming desperate.
   Shortly before Noor's visit, thousands of refugees had been
standing in parallel single-file lines stretching for more than a
mile waiting their turn to receive their meager daily ration of a
piece of bread, a tomato, a cucumber and a bottle of water.
   Scuffles broke out repeatedly as people at the back of the line
grew impatient and tried to move ahead to get to the trailer truck
where the food was being distributed.
   At the end of her visit, Noor appealed for international help to
assist the refugees, asking for food, tents, blankets and medicine
and, most importantly, ships and planes to take them home.
   ``I can't tell how long their repatriation will take, days or
weeks, but God forbid it should take months,'' she said. ``We must
impress on the world these people are living in even minimally
unacceptable conditions.''

<TEXT>
   An international team arrived Saturday
in this summit city, hoping to persuade the American and Soviet
presidents to discuss the fate of Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg.
   The commission members, including Wallenberg's half-brother, Guy
von Dardel, said they wanted to hand Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev a letter urging him to press the KGB to open its files on
Wallenberg.
   The panel planned a news conference Sunday while the superpower
leaders are talking about the Persian Gulf crisis, but they said
they did not expect to obtain a meeting with President Bush.
   Wallenberg is credited with saving tens of thousands of
Hungarian Jews from the Nazis during World War II. But he vanished
after the Soviets arrested him in Budapest.
   The Soviet Union said in 1957 that prison documents showed the
Swede had died of a heart attack in Moscow's Lubyanka Prison in
1947. The commission believes he may still be alive.
   ``We are closer to finding out the truth about Raoul Wallenberg
than we've been for the past 45 years,'' said Marvin Markinen, an
American professor and former inmate of Vladimir Prison, where
Wallenberg reportedly was spotted.
   ``The Wallenberg case has never been on a summit agenda but it
has also never been on the Soviet public agenda like it is now,''
said Canadian Irwin Cotler of the Soviet-International Joint
Commission on the Fate and Whereabouts of Raoul Wallenberg.
   Soviet television last week showed a drawing of Wallenberg the
way he might look if he were alive today at the age of 77. The
report appealed to the public for help in tracing him, Cotler said.
   ``Two years ago, no one in the street would have known who
Wallenberg was,'' he said.
   Swedish authorities presented Moscow with witness reports that
Wallenberg was alive in the 1950s and '60s and had been seen by
non-Soviets at Vladimir Prison, 12 miles outside Moscow. The
commission said there had been less reliable reports of sightings
in the 1970s and '80s.
   But the commission last week said it had found that Soviet
authorities never looked into the records at the prison, although
they said at the time they had done so.
   Therefore, the commission said, it found it hard to trust the
death certificate produced in 1957.
   Cotler said the commission believed Wallenberg's name would be
found only on classified lists of the KGB, the Soviet secret police
and intelligence agency.
   Cotler said Soviet Minister of Internal Affairs Vadim Bakatin
promised in a meeting Saturday he would bring up the matter with
KGB head Vadim Kryuchkov.
   ``If the KGB is not cooperating, there are now parliamentary
ways of holding them responsible,'' said Cotler.
   ``If Gorbachev wants to open up the blank pages of the Soviet
history, here is an opportunity. Gorbachev has knowledge of the KGB
and the capacity'' to open their files, Cotler said.
   The commission, which was formed two weeks ago, includes five
Soviet experts who have been granted access to prison archives
closed to foreigners.
   Von Dardel said he had worked for 10 years to get the Soviets
included in an international investigation. He said the doors of
Soviet ministries and prisons had opened up remarkably since that
occurred.

<TEXT>
   Four local banks have rejected the city's
request for a credit guarantee as the city seeks to borrow hundreds
of millions of dollars to avoid running out of cash this month,
according to published reports.
   Meridian Bankcorp Inc. confirmed Friday it would not help back
the sale of temporary loan notes scheduled for this week.
   The Philadelphia Daily News quoted unidentified sources Saturday
as saying CoreStates Financial Corp., Mellon Bank (East) and PNC
Financial Corp. also had turned down the city's request.
   ``We cannot reconcile the associated risk with our bank's
ongoing responsibilities to stockholders and other important
constituencies,'' Meridian said in a statement.
   Representatives of the other three banks would not comment.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode and other top city officials have refused
to comment on the notes since the mayor delivered a televised
address on the city's finances last month.
   The city initially planned to raise $450 million, but scaled
that back to $400 million. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported
Saturday it had obtained a document intended for would-be investors
that said the city now is offering $375 million in notes.
   Goode has said the city will be out of money by the end of this
month unless it receives a cash infusion. The notes would be repaid
from property and business tax receipts expected early next year.
   Goode also has asked for an emergency tax increase of up to $150
million, the possible sale of Veterans Stadium and other steps to
change a pattern of growing deficits in the city's budget.
   Even with the temporary notes, the city projects a $206.4
million deficit on this year's budget of $2.1 billion.
   The city's bond rating has been lowered to junk-bond status by
Moody's Investors Service. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. has warned it is
considering a similar rating.
   The city had asked each of the banks to issue letters of credit
for $15 million in temporary loan notes as part of an arrangement
in which a foreign bank would issue a letter of credit for as much
as $225 million, the Daily News reported.
   The letters would allow the city to guarantee $285 million worth
of notes and sell them at lower interest rates. The remaining $115
million in notes would not be guaranteed and would have to be
issued at a higher interest rate.
   A source told the Daily News the city hoped to secure a letter
of credit from Swiss Bank Corp. of Basel, Switzerland. Swiss Bank
officials declined to comment.
   A Japanese bank that had offered a $225 million letter has
pulled out, sources told the Daily News. The bank was not
identified.

<HEAD>Hemophiliac Boys' Suit Against Drug Companies Fails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three young hemophiliac brothers, who doctors
say were infected with the AIDS virus through contaminated blood
products, have lost their legal fight against two drug companies
that made such products.
   A federal judge cleared the companies of any responsibility
because Ricky, Robert and Randy Ray couldn't specify who made the
products they took for their hemophilia that exposed them to
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich granted the drug
companies' request Friday and dismissed a 1988 case filed on behalf
of Ricky, 13, Robert, 12, and Randy 10.
   Without showing a direct cause of the damages, the family cannot
sue for negligence, the judge ruled.
   The Rays drew national attention in 1987 when they were shunned
by the community of Arcadia and barred from school after their
health problems became known.
   Parents Louise and Clifford Ray sued the DeSoto County School
Board in federal court and won an order from Ms. Kovachevich that
the boys be reinstated.
   Angry, frightened parents of classmates boycotted the elementary
school. A week later the Rays' home was burned down in an unsolved
arson. The family has since settled in Sarasota.
   In April, doctors said Robert has full-blown AIDS.
   The Rays sued Cutter Laboratories, a Berkeley, Calif., division
of Miles Inc., and Armour Pharmaceutical Co. of Blue Bell, Pa.,
claiming they were negligent in the manufacture and distribution of
blood coagulating agents needed by hemophiliacs.
   The suit alleged the companies failed to screen out high-risk
blood donors, from whose plasma the clotting agents are obtained,
failed to test the products for AIDS, and failed to warn users of
the risks of contracting AIDS.
   Lawyers for the companies argued the Rays and their doctors
could not specifically identify which clotting agent infected the
boys.
   ``It was something we expected,'' said San Francisco lawyer
Duncan Barr, who defended the case for Cutter.
   He said the boys were heavily treated with clotting agent
produced by about five different companies. He said there was no
way to tell which company's product caused the infection, if any,
or if it may have been caused by whole blood they received.
   During the litigation, Cutter Laboratories mistakenly gave the
Rays' attorneys a memo showing that Cutter's own attorney
recommended as early as 1982 that plasma products carry warnings
about AIDS. Cutter and Armour didn't begin including the warnings
until 1984.

   With songs, prayers and tears, the families
and friends of nine Air Force reservists killed in a military plane
crash celebrated the airmen's lives on Saturday.
   ``Life was lost, but not in vain. It was given by volunteers who
selflessly served the cause of peace and freedom in an
unprecedented United Nations effort,'' Gen. Hansford T. Johnson
told about 2,000 people.
   More than 300 relatives of the men attended the ceremony in a
hangar at Kelly Air Force Base. It followed two days of funerals
for the officers and enlisted men, who were part of the 433rd
Military Airlift Wing at Kelly.
   The volunteers were among 13 people killed Aug. 28 when a C-5
cargo plane crashed and burned on takeoff at Ramstein Air Base in
West Germany. The plane was taking supplies to the Persian Gulf
region under Operation Desert Shield.
   Wreaths decorated the hangar for the service. Patriotic songs
recorded by Ray Charles and Elvis Presley resounded through the
breezy building, and sunlight beamed in from one open side.
   Air Force officers began the non-denominational service by
placing neatly folded American flags beneath the identification
tags of each of the dead reservists.
   Staff Sgt. Lorenzo Galvan Jr. _ the only surviving 433rd
reservist on the ill-fated flight _ placed a single red rose on
each flag.
   Galvan, who has declined to give interviews since the crash,
issued a statement Saturday, saying:
   ``Obviously, I have suffered a great loss. Our flying squadron
and wing has suffered an even greater loss. But the greatest loss
falls on the families of our departed crew members.''
   After the service _ concluded by an F-16 flyover in the
``missing man'' formation _ dozens of family members moved outside
to look at and climb around on a C-5, described by the Air Force as
the free world's largest aircraft.
   The 433rd reserve wing operates C-5s and has been taking part in
the U.S. military buildup in the Middle East for weeks.
   When the reservists were killed, their wing had not been called
to active duty. The men were volunteers who had arranged time off
from their civilian jobs to make the Middle East missions.

   President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived Saturday for summit talks spawned by
the Persian Gulf crisis. Bush said he hoped for common ground
against Iraq that would usher in a ``more peaceful, stable and
secure'' post-Cold War era.
   Gorbachev said it was important for the two men to cooperate to
protect ``positive trends'' taking place elsewhere in the world.
   Iraq's Saddam Hussein directed pre-summit advice to the two
leaders, telling Bush the prestige of the United States would sink
``if it were to slide into the abyss of war'' and telling Gorbachev
that siding with the Americans would increase world doubts about
Soviet status as a superpower.
   Saddam, in a statement read on Iraqi televison by a spokesman,
said that as the two men weigh summit decisions, ``the angels will
be hovering above you on one side and devils on the other.''
   Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, suggested
later that the prospect of U.S.-Soviet unity on the Persian Gulf
was upsetting Saddam.
   ``We hope it causes him to lose some sleep,'' Scowcroft said
after a working dinner with Bush and other top aides.
   The five-hour summit held out the prospect of an extraordinary
joint declaration against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Also on the
agenda for the hastily arranged meeting were sticky arms control
disputes, the future of Europe and other traditional East-West
concerns as well as possible aid to the Soviet Union.
   In Saudi Arabia, a diplomatic source said Gorbachev came to
Helsinki prepared to offer the Soviet maritime fleet to the United
States to transport equipment to the Middle East and to withdraw
the roughly 1,000 Soviet advisers from Iraq.
   The month-old U.S. military deployment has been handicapped by
the lack of sealift for materiel.
   Here in Helsinki, the usual summit accoutrements were in
evidence, from the extremely tight security to the Soviet, American
and Finnish flags flying side by side by side. T-shirts showing the
faces of Bush and Gorbachev superimposed on Saddam's visage were
selling for $20.
   Bush and Gorbachev, accompanied by their wives, arrived seven
hours apart to identical red carpet greetings from Finnish
President Mauno Koivisto.
   The summit will be their third as leaders of their countries.
   Bush denounced Iraq sharply in his arrival remarks, saying it
must be denied the ``fruits of aggression.'' Gorbachev spoke in
more restrained terms of the need to ensure that positive trends in
the world are not ``thwarted by any development.'' He did not
mention Iraq or Saddam by name.
   Both Bush and Gorbachev made it clear they were hoping to use
the summit to continue the improvement in relations between their
two countries.
   ``If you want to think of a complicated situation, shift the
clock back several years and think about how difficult it would be
to work this equation now, get the international support that has
been gotten, but try to do it without the Soviet Union being a part
of it,'' Bush said.
   ``Clearly I hope that we'll come out of this meeting tomorrow
not with every difference ironed out but with a common purpose so
that ... the United States and the Soviet Union will be seen by
others around the world to be in accord in our determination to
stop this ugly aggression,'' he added.
   He called Gorbachev ``not some adversary,'' but the leader of a
country ``with whom I think we're going to have increasingly
productive relations.''
   ``If the nations of the world, acting together, continue, as
they have been, to isolate Iraq and deny Saddam the fruits of
aggression, we will set in place the cornerstone of an
international order, more peaceful, stable and secure than any that
we have known.''
   He added: ``Much is at stake and there is much the world stands
to gain if we succeed.
   Gorbachev said it was important for the two men to meet
personally to ``discuss the acute crisis in the Persian Gulf and a
number of other issues'' and to cooperate.
   The White House took pains to minimize the chances for an arms
control breakthrough at the summit, even though talks are moving
slowly to reduce nuclear stockpiles as well as to cut conventional
forces in Europe. ``This is not a negotiating session,'' said one
official.
   Helsinki is no stranger to important international meetings.
Finlandia Hall, where Bush and Gorbachev will hold a news
conference after their talks, was the site for the signing in 1975
of an international accord on human rights.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III arrived shortly before
Gorbachev after a trip to the Middle East to drum up increased
support for the effort to isolate Iraq.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak pledged more troops to defend
Saudi Arabia and said the summit participants should stand firm on
sanctions ordered by the U.N. Security Council against Iraq. ``I
hope that Gorbachev and Bush have one line for dealing with this
problem,'' he said. ``This would be a hell of problem in this area
if there are differences.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived with
Gorbachev, one day after declaring he was ``ready if necessary'' to
go to Iraq to seek a peaceful resolution of the gulf crisis.
   Bush plunged into a schedule of appearances lasting through the
morning and early afternoon despite his overnight flight from
Washington.
   He stopped his limousine to shake hands briefly with the crowds
along his route between stops. Mel Hughes told reporters he was the
mayor of Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., and that it was terrific to
shake the president's hand, even if ``we had to come all the way to
Finland to do it.''
   Gorbachev had barely arrived when he waded into a crowd along
the street.
   Before arriving, Bush told reporters he would be interested in
pursuing a possible deal with Gorbachev in which the United States
would give the Soviets oil-producing technology, perhaps involving
pipelines. In exchange, the Soviet Union would make some of its
vast oil reserves available to the West to make up for supplies
lost from the Persian Gulf.
   Bush said he did not plan to ask Gorbachev to send ground forces
to supplement the U.S.-led deployment in Saudi Arabia.
   The Soviets have been urging a diplomatic solution to the
Persian Gulf crisis, but Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov said earlier that the Soviet Union would be willing to
send military forces to the Middle East under a military staff
committee that included officers from the five permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council.
   Bush also said he wanted ``very much'' to visit U.S. troops in
Saudi Arabia, but planned to wait until ``all our forces are there
and things calm down.'' He said he hoped the American military
deployment in the Persian Gulf ``will keep Saddam Hussein from
doing anything reckless.''

<HEAD>Animal Activists Protest Plan to Swap Dolphin With The Navy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Animal rights activists picketed New England
Aquarium on Saturday over its proposal to send an antisocial
dolphin to a top-secret Navy research center, but the aquarium
director said no decision has been made.
   Rainbow, an 11-year-old, 8-foot-2, 450-pound male, blue-gray
bottlenose dolphin would be swapped for a partly deaf female in the
Navy's secret underwater mammal program at the Naval Ocean Systems
Center in San Diego.
   ``We are vehemently opposed to any dolphin being given to the
Navy under any circumstances,'' said Doreen Close, a spokeswoman
for the Boston Marine Mammal Coalition. ``Once they get into the
Navy's hands, we have no way of knowing what happens to them.''
   John H. Prescott, the aquarium's executive director, said public
concern over Rainbow's future has led him to reconsider the trade.
   About 60 members of the coalition and other activists peacefully
picketed the aquarium, protesting the proposed swap of the dolphins.
   ``We capture them, we use them, we abuse them, then we dump
them,'' said Richard O'Barry, a former trainer of the dolphins on
the 1960s television series ``Flipper.'' He was not affiliated with
the marine mammal coalition.
   Aquarium officials say Rainbow is too aggressive and has become
less compatible with other dolphins at the aquarium as he has
matured.
   The Naval Ocean Systems Center studies and trains 142 marine
mammals, 109 of which are dolphins, in underwater surveillance and
detecting and marking objects for recovery. Further details on the
center's purpose are classified.
   Prescott said the swap was considered because the Navy could use
Rainbow's sonar and hearing for its research, while the partly deaf
female from the center would be suitable with those at the aquarium.
   O'Barry said dolphins in captivity are abused simply by being
placed inside steel or concrete tanks. They become ill and
stressed, he said.
   ``You can't take a sonic creature and put it in a steel box.
It's different from every other animal in that aquarium,'' he said.
``They are animals of sound.''
   In May, a former trainer of the Navy center alleged that the
Navy was training bottlenose dolphins with .45-caliber guns mounted
on their snouts to kill enemy frogmen. Officials at the center
denied those claims.
   A federal Marine Mammal Commission probe found no major problems
with the center's program or dolphin deaths in the past 13 months.
That probe was initiated because of reports in 1988 that 13
dolphins in the Navy had died between 1986 and 1988.
   ``Any dolphin in the world is in more danger from swimming into
drift nets than (from) any training program of the Navy,'' said
Kathy Krieger, curator of marine mammals at the aquarium.
   She said NOSC research has helped aquariums in caring for their
dolphins and whales.

<HEAD>Federal Government Witholds $2.8 Million in Magnet Funds for
Seattle Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Education Department is withholding $2.8
million from Seattle schools while it reviews the school board's
decision to relax racial-balance guidelines, district officials say.
   Schools Superintendent William Kendrick told board members
Friday that the government wants to review the new guidelines
before deciding whether to release federal funds for magnet
programs designed to encourage desegregation.
   ``There is a strong possibility that no money will be available
to us'' for magnet programs this school year, Kendrick said in a
memo.
   The new guidelines, approved Wednesday on a 4-3 board vote, seek
to reduce mandatory busing by allowing more minority and white
students to attend the schools of their choice.
   The plan allows 75 percent of a school's population to come from
a single group, including whites. It also allows 100 percent
minority student population _ 75 percent Asian and 25 percent
black, for example.
   Previous guidelines called for a maximum of 50 percent from any
one minority group, 70 percent total minorities or 65 percent white.
   Supporters said the new guidelines would help curb white flight
from the district.
   Critics contended the move was a step back that could lead to
all-minority schools. They also said the new guidelines could
jeopardize federal magnet funds, state construction funds and open
the district to lawsuits.
   Under federal guidelines, a school is considered segregated if
minority enrollment is more than 50 percent, though schools can
receive money if improvements are made without meeting that
standard.
   Board member Ken Eastlack, who proposed the new guidelines, said
he would propose amending the plan to exempt schools that receive
federal magnet funds.
   He said Wednesday he was willing to risk the federal magnet
funds to keep district enrollment up. The district loses $3,400 in
state funds when a student leaves the district.
   Magnet programs will be in place when students return to school
Monday, but officials are unsure how long the programs can continue
without federal funds. Five high schools and 14 elementary schools
had magnet programs last year.
   The Education Department has requested information on how the
new racial-balance guidelines will affect integration, said Patty
McDonald, district community-relations director.
   The agency will then determine whether the district still
qualifies for magnet funds. McDonald said she was unsure whether
the district would eliminate the magnet programs or try to cut
other parts of the district budget.
   The new guidelines will not take effect immediately, but would
give 3,000 students on a waiting list a better chance of attending
the school of their choice.
   Last year, the district was allotted $3.2 million in federal
magnet funds.
   Even before Wednesday's vote, the Education Department withheld
$417,000 from last year's magnet package for two high schools the
agency considered segregated, giving the district until Sept. 15 to
find a way to desegregate them.
   Seattle schools receive a total of $12.8 million in federal
funds this year for other programs, including hot lunches, special
education and supplementary programs for academically and
economically disadvantaged children.

<HEAD>Judge Considers Mistrial in Murder Trial of Lawmaker's Son</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The trial of a 20-year-old state
legislator's son accused of killing his mother with a hunting arrow
was recessed Saturday by a visibly angry judge responding to a
defense motion for a mistrial.
   Defense attorney Henri Conti asked for a mistrial after state
Rep. Robert Goetsch testified about a two-foot pipe weapon found at
the scene of his wife's death.
   Conti said District Attorney Kevin Schram had not previously
disclosed information about the pipe.
   ``It was withheld and dropped on us today,'' Conti said. ``It's
substantially prejudicial. It's poisoned the well. It's grounds for
a mistrial.''
   Court rules require the prosecution to disclose evidence and
testimony that is expected on the stand so the defense can
adequately prepare its case.
   Goetsch's son, Chad, is charged with first-degree intentional
homicide for fatally shooting 51-year-old Carolyn Goetsch in the
heart with the arrow on Nov. 8.
   Chad also is charged with recklessly endangering safety for
pointing a second arrow at his father and fighting with him after
Mrs. Goetsch was shot.
   Dodge County Circuit Judge Daniel Klossner said he would
consider the motion for a mistrial unless prosecution and defense
lawyers can come to an agreement that would allow ``curative''
instructions to the jury.
   Klossner said he would rule on the mistrial motion Monday after
considering the attorneys' proposed jury instructions.
   Goetsch described the circumstances surrounding his wife's death
at the family's home in the town of Oak Grove.
   Conti made the motion for a mistrial after Goetsch testified his
son made the pipe weapon last fall to protect himself after being
attacked and robbed.
   Schram said he learned about the pipe while talking informally
to Robert Goetsch on Aug. 22. He said the conversation does not
fall under the rules of evidence and did not need to be revealed to
the defense.
   In other testimony, Goetsch said his son threatened Mrs. Goetsch
so often last summer and fall that she talked about buying a gun
because she was afraid her son would kill her.
   ``I guess she did take them (the threats) more seriously than
I,'' Goetsch said. ``We talked about buying a gun. She started
insisting on locking the doors. She said she was afraid of him. She
was afraid he was going to kill her.''
   The day his wife died, Goetsch said his wife got out of bed
early in the morning after both heard a knock on the door. Goetsch
said he heard his wife's voice and another voice, but went back to
sleep until he was awakened by loud screaming.
   His wife appeared in the doorway of their bedroom and collapsed,
he said. When he went to the body, he said, he saw his son standing
in the hallway aiming a loaded hunting bow at him.
   Goetsch said he lunged over the body and grabbed the arrow
pointed at him and broke it. He said he and Chad then fought for
several minutes throughout the house while his daughter Shana, then
14, tried to call police.
   Chad broke away at least once and attacked his sister while she
called authorities, Goetsch said.
   Goetsch said he asked his son, who was supposed to be away at
college: ``Why did you kill my wife ... Why are you here?''
   He said his son replied: ``I was lonesome.''

   Thirty years ago, bedlam broke out at the
National Baptist convention in Philadelphia, forcing the
denomination into a leadership battle that led to the last major
split in black Baptist history.
   The 110th annual meeting of the National Baptist Convention
U.S.A. Inc. that wraps up with a worship service Sunday has been a
kinder, gentler affair, buit some say similar issues remain.
   The denomination raised $1 million to reduce the mortgage on its
first headquarters, the $10 million World Baptist Center in
Nashville, Tenn., and delegates unanimously approved a resolution
urging the government to keep U.S. troops out of combat in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``The most significant thing, I think, has been the general
spirit of the convention. There has been more fellowship, more
spirit, than ever,'' said the Rev. T.J. Jemison, convention
president.
   Others say issues that led to the crisis in 1960, including
perceptions of a president unwilling to share power, are rising
again.
   The battle in the 1960 convention was over power. The Rev.
Joseph H. Jackson, who ousted Jemison's father, the Rev. D.V.
Jemison, from the presidency in 1953, consolidated his own power
and ignored tenure requirements.
   In 1960, civil rights leaders such as the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. and the Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy wanted the nation's
largest black church to become a force for social change.
   That led to a large group of Baptists to support for president a
civil rights candidate, the Rev. Gardner C. Taylor. Rival groups
paraded throughout the convention, each side trying to drown out
the other.
   ``It was extremely painful for me,'' recalled the Rev. Arlene H.
Churn, who was a teen-ager at the 1960 convention. ``I can remember
curtains being torn down from the convention hall, chairs being
overturned, altercations.''
   After Taylor won a disputed election, the issue of who
controlled the convention went to the federal courts, which ruled
they did not have jurisdiction in an ecclesiastical dispute.
   The stage was set for the fateful break at the Kansas City
convention in 1961.
   In that convention, said historian Taylor Branch, masses of
preachers supporting either Taylor or Jackson collided like a giant
rugby scrum, shoving, slugging and wrestling each other out of the
way to take control of the convention. In the melee, the Rev. A.G.
Wright of Detroit was killed when he fell off the platform.
   Jackson won the battle. Many opposition preachers left to form
the Progressive National Baptist Convention. Jackson was to rule
the National Baptist Convention until 1982 when he was ousted and
Jemison took over.
   The Jemison administration held promise for many of a more
aggressive social agenda, and a more collegial power-sharing within
the denomination.
   In 1984, the convention voted to begin limiting the presidency
to two five-year terms.
   Most people agree that Jemison, who led the Baton Rouge, La.,
boycott of segregated busing in 1953, has been more socially active.
   In his presidential address this year, Jemison decried what he
said was the deterioration of race relations in the nation,
charging that former President Reagan gave respectability to racism
and referring to conservatives on the Supreme Court as ``strict
segregationists.''
   Jemison also is credited with being the driving force behind the
Baptist center dedicated in 1989 in Nashville. He called the
denominational headquarters, the first of its kind for a black
church body, ``our Vatican.''
   The Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson, convention general secretary,
said the center, which is designed to address social issues such as
AIDS, homelessness and other denominational programs, is ``a sign
of hope to National Baptists.''
   But some others say the building reflects a denomination more
concerned with elaborate structures than social needs.
   ``This really saddens me to see $10 million in the glorification
of a center versus all the nation crying out for help,'' Delegate
Al Lipscomb of Dallas said.
   While some ministers say Jemison has shown some signs of greater
collegiality, including appointing more younger members to
positions of prominence than his predecessor, others say there is
concern throughout the church about the issue of sharing authority.
   ``The leadership of the president has been a strong
leadership,'' the Rev. Paul Thompson of New Hope Baptist Church in
Buffalo, N.Y., said. ``There is concern about trying to share that
leadership more.''
   The real test is expected in 1994, when Jemison would be obliged
by the tenure rules he helped institute to step down from the
presidency. Jemison has refused to say whether he would seek the
presidency again in 1994.
   ``That's too far away,'' he said Friday.

   Following are excerpts translated from
Arabic by The Associated Press from Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's message to presidents Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev on the
eve of the superpower summit.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``Your meeting will be watched with keen and unusual interest by
the whole world, including the peoples of a region which God
blessed, by making us a part of the Arab nation. ...
   ``I will neither plead with you nor dictate what decisions you
must adopt because each of you has his own will and freedom of
decision.
   ``But before you make whatever decisions you will, I would like
to begin by saying that Iraq's army did not invade either of your
countries and has no intention to harm anyone or jeopardize the
legitimate interests of anyone. Iraq is a peace-loving nation. We
desire peace which is based on justice. Iraq respects the free
decision of others. ...
   ``Before either of you make a decision on Kuwait, you should
remember that the Arab nation is one nation, even though it is
split now; that this is a fact that cannot be denied by its rulers,
leaders, peoples, or sons; that the overwhelming majority of its
sons, rulers, and peoples are honored to be part of this great
nation; and that they are longing to be one political entity,
regardless of the specific characteristics of this or that country.
...
   ``Kuwait is part of Iraq. The Kuwaiti people are part of the
Iraqi people. British colonialism severed it from Iraq for colonial
reasons. Iraq did not recognize this measure. ...
   ``Any attempt to reverse the situation to what it was before
Aug. 2, 1990, is an impractical and sterile attempt that will push
the region into chaos. Furthermore, the attempts aimed at promoting
the instability constitute a premeditated conspiracy against the
Arab nation, at the head of which is lofty Iraq. ...
   ``When you consider these facts in their proper perspective and
show humility once you know the rights of mankind, you will realize
that the Arabs, by their recollection of the relevant background on
the basis of these facts, are more capable than others of resolving
all inter-Arab affairs.
   ``You will also then realize that foreigners, including
yourselves, are incapable of offering the proper solution.
   ``Neither of you is capable of providing a proper settlement of
an Arab problem, whose parties are Arabs. We can swear, and God and
history are witness to this, that the foreign intervention is
complicating matters and will not provide a settlement. ...
   ``The occupation and invasion of the prophet's birthplace and
tomb is an insult directed not only against the 200 million Arabs,
but the 1 billion Moslems. ...
   ``They will join and pool all resources to resist this obscene
act and defeat the oppressors.''
   ``Every politician knows the United States, and for awhile now,
has been manipulating the world and dictating its terms with no one
standing up to confront it as the case was before.
   ``Those concerned with this problem should take advantage of
this crucial time in history and employ this critical problem to
restore to the Soviet Union its respect as a decisive power ...
through adopting a position that is in harmony with all that is
just and fair, and rejecting the discriminatory approach the United
States is pursuing.
   ``I pray that the merciful allow you to take decisions that
would allow some light into the hearts of the heartless, espcially
Bush, in the interest of humanity at large. ...
   ``President Bush must not bring his country and its status down
to a lower level, because we are certain that its position will
drop on the scale of appreciation and effectiveness if it falls
into the abyss of war, and if its armies and the armies of its
allies remain in the land of our sanctuaries, and if it continues
this unjustified and cruel blockade which is depriving the people
of Iraq of food and medicine and cutting off the supply of milk
from children who need it. ...
   ``The Iraqi people will stand united against injustice and the
unjust, and against the invasion and the invaders. The traitors,
who encouraged those who have been deluded, will be a small
minority.
   ``When the battle has taken place, then the Iraqi people, whom
God has chosen to be in the forefront, will triumph ... and all the
invaders will be defeated, their banners torn apart, and deafened
by the shouts of `God is great and damned be the invaders.''

   Kara Kennedy, the daughter of Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, was married Saturday in this Cape Cod town to
Michael Allen, a 33-year-old architect.
   The 30-year-old bride served as a campaign manager for her
father's re-election in 1988. Most recently, she has been a
producer for a Boston television station.
   ``The easiest job was walking Kara down the aisle,'' the senator
said through a spokesman. ``The hardest job was giving her away.''
   His daughter had 14 bridesmaids, including cousins Robin
Lawford, Victoria Lawford Pender and Kerry Kennedy Cuomo.
   Kara Kennedy and her bridesmaids all wore designer gowns, as did
her mother, Joan Bennett Kennedy.
   For the day of the ceremony, Sen. Kennedy placed nautical flags
on all of the Kennedy family sailboats that spelled out ``Kara and
Michael.'' Keeping with the Cape Cod theme, the wedding cake
featured a replica of the family sailboat, The Victura.
   A private reception was held at the home of Rose Fitzgerald
Kennedy, the bride's grandmother.
   The couple will live in Washington, D.C., where Allen works.

   The U.S. Justice Department believes it has
recovered all of the computer equipment containing secret data
inadvertently sold as surplus from the U.S. attorney's office, a
department spokesman said.
   Michael W. Robinson in Washington declined to elaborate in his
statement Friday, but a lawyer in Kentucky said federal agents are
trying to determine whether anyone tampered with the information.
   Robinson would not comment on whether anyone viewed the files or
distributed the data.
   The Justice Department's announcement came a day after
businessman Charles Hayes of rural Pulaski County identified
customers who bought surplus computer equipment from him believed
to contain the secret files.
   Hayes paid $45 for a broken word processing system from the U.S.
attorney's office in Lexington on Aug. 3., but a technician failed
to erase the computer's memory, giving Hayes seven years' worth of
secret files.
   The data contained names of FBI informants, federally protected
witnesses and details of pending criminal and civil cases,
according to court records.
   Retrieval of the computers is significant. The Justice
Department feared the secret files might land in the wrong hands
and ruin pending criminal and civil cases handled by the office of
U.S. Attorney Louis DeFalaise.
   To complicate matters, Hayes later sold some of the computer
equipment. Hayes owns Challenger Ltd., which buys government
surplus equipment for resale to the public.
   Hayes' attorney, Bill D. Gregory, said government officials told
him the equipment would be examined for signs of tampering.
   Gregory said he is contemplating a countersuit against the
government for its handling of the case. He contends a deposition
Hayes gave Thursday will show the Pulaski County businessman is
cooperating fully with the government.
   Justice Department lawyers did not file a transcript of Hayes'
five-hour secret deposition, the U.S. District Court clerk's office
said. Government attorneys had said they would file the transcript
but would censor any sensitive details.

   Politicians and celebrities at a black-tie
benefit on Ellis Island rubbed elbows Saturday with corporate
leaders who helped finance the restoration of the so-called Golden
Door that received 12 million U.S. immigrants.
   And, yes, the descendants of immigrants also dotted the crowd.
   Denise Benmosche of Suffern, N.Y., waiting for a ferry to take
her to the benefit, said she wanted to see what her father had seen
when he first came to the United States.
   ``That's exciting for me to see where he actually first set foot
in the United States. It's very emotional,'' she said.
   Between 1892 and 1924, Ellis Island, which adjoins Liberty
Island and the Statue of Liberty, was the Golden Door _ immigrants'
main port of entry for New York City. At its peak, the island
processed 5,000 immigrants a day.
   The U.S. government 25 years ago gave the island to the National
Parks Service, stipulating that it become a national museum to
honor those who entered the United States there.
   ``It's a great monument,'' said Lee Iacocca, chairman of
Chrysler Corp., who spearheaded the restoration drive. ``Half the
country can trace its roots to here. The people who came here; they
made the country. If you don't honor them, who are you going to
honor?''
   As Iacocca spoke, numerous bands scattered throughout the island
played folk music from a variety of countries.
   ``I think it's a wonderful thing for us, particularly at time
where there are such divisions in the city _ to realize that we all
came from somewhere else,'' said Nancy Ticktin.
   She said she visited Ellis Island before the renovation project
and said she ``felt the ghosts of the past. It was a thrill to be
at the entry way to the country.''
   After the black-tie dinner, a program by Emmy-winning producer
Don Mischer was scheduled to show the island's role in the American
dream. It featured actor Hume Cronyn, writer Art Buchwald, singer
Leslie Uggams, amd Metropolitan Opera tenor Jerry Hadley.
   The hoopla Saturday night anticipated Sunday's ribbon-cutting
ceremony for the Ellis Island Immigration Museum. The museum opens
to the public Monday, after a $156 million restoration project that
lasted eight years.

<TEXT>
   An Iraqi Airways charter flight arrived
late Saturday carrying 130 Americans from Kuwait, including a woman
who gave birth to twins while fighting raged around her in the
conquered nation.
   ``I could hear the bombs while I was in labor,'' said Claudia
Ledesma of San Diego, Calif., who delivered her babies on Aug. 26
while some resistance activity continued against the Iraqis 22 days
after they invaded Kuwait.
   Mrs. Ledesma and her fellow passengers, women and children who
had been allowed to leave Kuwait by Iraqi president Saddam Hussein,
arrived thirsty, hungry and exhausted.
   Iraq, meanwhile, said it would no longer fly evacuees to Jordan.
   The U.S. State Department said evacuation flights will continue
to other destinations despite the order, which was to take effect
Sunday.
   The charter flight arrived in Amman just before midnight with
130 people on board, U.S. Embassy sources said.
   Embassy officials said earlier the plane was carrying about 150
Americans. There was no explanation for the discrepancy in figures.
   The charter stopped over in Baghdad, where the passengers were
issued with exit permits before flying on to Amman, which has been
the primary transit point for thousands of evacuees fleeing Iraq
and Kuwait.
   Some of the Americans, including several infants, were examined
by physicians while they were crowded in a terminal waiting room at
Queen Alia International Airport.
   One woman in a purple shirt and glasses held a small, white
poodle. A teen-age boy was wearing an Oakland Raiders cap and black
T-shirt.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said they were to board a Northwest
Airlines charter to Frankfurt, West Germany, and then after
refueling would continue to a U.S. Air Force Base in Charleston,
S.C. About 165 American evacuees who arrived on a similar charter
on Friday will join them on the trip home.
   The latest group of evacuees applauded as an embassy
representative gave a brief statement, but they were behind glass
windows and reporters could not hear what he said.
   Other embassy representatives took care of their needs with
bottled water, sandwiches and soft drinks.
   Later, Mrs. Ledesma held one baby in her arms and a friend stood
by her holding the other while they talked briefly with reporters,
describing the difficulty of choosing to leave their husbands
behind for safety outside Kuwait.
   ``He said that he wanted the children to have an opportunity and
that since the U.S. Embassy was giving it to us we wouldn't lose
it,'' Mrs. Ledesma said.
   Saddam banned the men from traveling and is holding some of them
at key installations to fend off an attack against Iraq by
thousands of U.S.-led forces that assembled in Saudi Arabia after
the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   A woman who identified herself only as Renee said the Kuwaitis
were very much opposed to Saddam and that people she knew there
were suffering.
   ``They don't deserve this. They are being attacked. There is
looting,'' she said.
   Naji al-Hadithi, director general of Iraq's Information
Ministry, told reporters in Baghdad earlier that Jordanian airport
officials had complained they could no longer handle the hundreds
of foreigners that have been pouring into Amman for the past week.
   He said a charter flight on Saturday to the Jordanian capital of
Amman would be the last.
   Al-Hadithi said the two regularly scheduled Iraqi Airways
flights daily from Baghdad to Amman would not be affected. He said
Iraq would be willing to reroute the charters to other destinations.
   ``We are ready to take them to any other capital or city, even
to the farthest point,'' he said.
   The director general also said that the short-haul charters to
Amman, paid for by the passengers' governments, were not profitable.
   A spokesman for the Amman airport denied there was a crowding
problem. ``Everything is fine, the airport is not crowded,'' said
Mashhour El-Kurashi.
   Jordan's official news agency reported that 14,000 evacuees from
Iraq and Kuwait, including Arabs, Asians and Westerners, departed
from Amman airport aboard 66 charter flights Friday.
   Those arriving Iraqi Airways charters usually transfer
imediately to other planes for the journey to their home countries.
Iraq had been allowing up to three charter flights a day from
Baghdad to Jordan.

   Hurricane Isidore lost strength and became a
tropical storm Saturday as it moved northwest at 14 mph over open
water.
   The storm's maximum sustained winds were 65 mph and it was about
1,050 miles northwest of the Cape Verde Islands, the National
Hurricane Center reported. The storm was located near latitude 28.4
north and longitude 39.9 west at 4:45 p.m.
   The weather service predicted that the storm would continue to
weaken and the same course was expected for the next 24 hours.
   Isidore reached hurricane strength late Thursday, only a day
after it had formed into the ninth named storm of the 1990 Atlantic
hurricane season.
   A hurricane has sustained winds of at least 74 mph, while
tropical storms have a threshold of 39 mph.

   One inmate was stabbed to death
Saturday and three others injured in a series of fights at the
Charlotte Correctional Institution, prison officials said.
   Guards quickly broke up the fights that began in the yard at the
high-security prison, and no officers were injured, said state
corrections spokesman Bob Macmaster.
   ``One inmate died, stabbed to death in an altercation with at
least one other inmate,'' the spokesman said. ``They had several
other individual fights involving inmates at about that time or
right after, and the guards moved in immediately.''
   Three other inmates were treated for injuries they suffered in
the disturbance, he said.
   The prison, located on the Gulf Coast 40 miles south of the
Tampa Bay area, has been locked down, and all weekend visits
canceled, he added.
   Macmaster said investigators were trying to determine what
touched off the incident.

   Salim Fakhri, a prominent exiled opponent of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, has died. He was 69.
   Fakhri died after collapsing at the Grosvenor House Hotel on
Thursday.
   Scotland Yard police headquarters said Saturday he died of
natural causes. ``There is no suspicion of any crime and there is
no inquiry,'' it said.
   Newspapers reported that Fakhri was a potential target of the
Saddam regime, which invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 and since has been
squeezed by an international economic embargo.
   The Sunday Telegraph newspaper said its reporter Nicholas
Farrell was interviewing Fakhri when he collapsed. Farrell said
Fakhri had spoken with him before going to a meeting of Iraqi
opposition groups and then returned for further conversation
minutes before he collapsed.
   He described Fakhri as a retired Iraqi army colonel who became a
liberal democrat and secretary of the Democratic Rescue Movement,
which was aimed at establishing a Western-style democracy in Iraq.
   Farrell said Fakhri had been instrumental in engineering a
coalition of secularist groups such as his and the two main Iraqi
Shiite fundamentalist groups.
   He quoted Fakhri as having said, ``The Iraqi opposition is
powerful. With time we can topple him. It's probably within months
rather than years.''

<HEAD>Shortages of Bread Spreading in Soviet Union</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bread shortages have spread from Moscow to other
cities, including Leningrad, and soldiers have been mobilized to
help bakers in the capital, Soviet media reported Saturday.
   ``There is a terrible shortage of flour and yeast,'' the head of
Leningrad's central baking plants told Pravda, the Communist Party
newspaper.
   ``Suppliers are letting us down. And they in turn, as far as I
understand, don't have enough grain. We've had to tap even our
normally inviolable reserves,'' said the bakery chief, identified
only as V. Ivanov.
   Long lines for bread appeared in Moscow during the past week for
the first time since the early 1960s. Soviet officials blamed
hoarding, antiquated equipment and a sudden rise in demand as
residents returned from their traditional August vacations.
   The shortage initially was reported only in the Moscow region,
where the military newspaper Red Star reported that hundreds of
soldiers were ordered to temporary duty as bakery workers and
delivery men.
   On Saturday, Pravda said long lines for bread also had appeared
in Leningrad and Tula, about 125 miles south of Moscow. The
workers' newspaper Trud also reported a bread shortage in
Archangel, a White Sea port 620 miles northeast of the capital.
   A bakery official in Tula blamed reports from Moscow, which he
said had touched off a wave of panic buying.
   The bread shortage comes at the end of a long summer of other
shortages that have tried the patience of Soviet consumers,
including a lack of cigarettes, medicine, gasoline and paper.
   There have been street protests in Moscow, Leningrad and other
cities, and a riot in the Siberian city of Chelyabinsk. A leader of
the traditionalist faction with the Communist Party, Ivan Polozkov,
said Tuesday that the lack of goods was causing people to question
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reform program.
   The bread shortage is occurring in the midst of a record Soviet
grain harvest, estimated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture at
about 215 million tons.
   The problem, analysts say, is that a shortage of fuel and
machinery is preventing the crop from being harvested quickly and
transported efficiently to market.
   According to Soviet press reports, a quarter of the country's
combine harvesters are idle for lack of spare parts. Deliveries of
other vehicles and supplies are behind schedule. As a result, grain
had been harvested from only 28 million acres by midsummer, down
from 40 million acres at the same time last year.

<TEXT>
   A Mohawk warrior and two soldiers were injured
Saturday in a scuffle on the Kahnesatake settlement west of
Montreal where Canadian troops were locked in a standoff with a
group of armed Indians.
   Mohawk spokesmen said a 51-year-old Mohawk was awakened in his
sleep and ``severely beaten'' by soldiers.
   The army said the Mohawk drew a knife and attacked a soldier.
   The soldier was on a reconnaissance patrol to check out
defensive positions put up by the Indians, the army said in a
statement. Troops have surrounded the Indians within a small wooded
area and have put up a barbed wire fence.
   The soldier told the Mohawk that he had no aggressive
intentions, but the Indian attacked him, the army said.
   The patrol of four soldiers subdued the Indian, who suffered a
gash near an eye that required stitches.
   One soldier was slashed on the face and another stabbed four
times in the abdomen, but their injuries were not considered
serious, the army said.
   A doctor who examined Mohawk, identified only by his warrior
code name of Spudwrench, said he had suffered ``multiple
lacerations and a possible depressed skull fracture.''
   After lengthy negotiations, the Mohawk was taken to a Montreal
hospital by ambulance under an army escort in the early evening,
more than 12 hours after the clash.
   Joan Lamontagne, a spokesman for Montreal General Hospital, said
the Mohawk was undergoing medical tests and that she did not know
the extent of his injuries.
   The incident raised tensions among the Mohawks, who were also
upset by a decision by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. to pull its
camera crews out of the Indian encampment.
   About 20 Mohawk men and 30 women and children are holed up in a
detoxification center in the wooded area in the Kahnesatake
settlement, 18 miles west of Montreal. They are surrounded by about
400 soldiers.
   They retreated to the center after the army moved in last
weekend to dismantle barricades set up by the Indians.
   Also Saturday, the Iroquois Confederacy held a news conference
to present a proposal to end the conflict, which began July 11 when
Quebec provincial police stormed a Mohawk barricade erected to
protest a decision by the town of Oka to expand a municipal golf
course onto land claimed by the Indians.
   The Iroquois proposal, similar to one rejected earlier by
federal negotiators, calls for ending the standoff by imposing
Indian control over the area occupied by the troops _ with Indian
peacekeeping officers investigating anyone suspected of committing
crimes.
   Natives say they fear reprisals from the Quebec police for the
death of one of their officers in the botched raid in July.
   Federal Indian Affairs Minister Tom Siddon quickly dismissed the
proposal as unacceptable ``because it would cede Canadian
sovereignty to the Mohawk people.''
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa broke off talks late last month
with the Mohawks and ordered the army in to remove barricades set
up by the Indians.
   The dispute over the golf course expansion was resolved when the
federal government purchased the land and said it would give it to
the Indians. But the Mohawks have raised a wider range of
grievances, including demands for sovereignty.

<TEXT>
   Lt. Gov. Martha Griffiths, dumped by the
governor from his re-election ticket, on Saturday nixed plans to
hold a tribute for her at the Democratic state convention.
   The 78-year-old Griffiths said she didn't want the party tribute
that had been scheduled for Sunday, ``because I hate to hear a
bunch of hypocrites up talking.''
   Gov. James Blanchard, 48, announced in August his plans to drop
Griffiths, who served as his lieutenant governor for two terms,
saying he felt she was no longer ready to step in at any moment and
take over as governor.
   Griffiths said she didn't want a tribute because ``I already
have been extended the greatest tribute by the people of Michigan.
It is their support, encouragement and love that have made my long
career in public office possible. To the people, I owe a deep debt
of gratitude.''
   Griffiths had said earlier she wouldn't be at the convention,
but she played hostess at a breakfast for legislative candidates
Saturday and spoke at a Women's Democratic Caucus luncheon.
   Olivia Maynard, Blanchard's pick to replace Griffiths, must be
approved by delegates Sunday. Maynard, 54, previously served as
state party chief and has been director of the state's Office of
Services to the Aging since March 1983.
   In an interview taped Friday with CBS News' ``Face to Face With
Connie Chung'' _ scheduled for broadcast Monday night _ Griffiths
was asked if she thought her replacement on the ticket was
qualified.
   She replied that Maynard had never been an elected official.
   But on Saturday, Griffiths, a former congresswoman and a
longtime campaigner for women's rights, said she didn't mean
Maynard was unqualified.
   ``What I said, I think, is that Libby doesn't have parliamentary
experience,'' Griffiths said Saturday.
   Griffiths said the lieutenant governor's main duty is to bring
votes to the ticket and Maynard would accomplish that.
   ``I'm sure she will do a wonderful job,'' Griffiths said.
   Maynard, known as Libby, has been head of the state Office of
Services to the Aging since 1983. She is to be nominated Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter has yet
to face strong opposition as he goes into Senate confirmation
hearings this week, but some groups still have doubts about his
positions on abortion and other contentious issues.
   Souter's hearings begin Thursday, and some Senate Judiciary
Committee members say they will press the New Hampshire judge for
his views on the vexing social issues he'd face on the nation's
highest court.
   But Souter may prove a reluctant witness, disappointing those
senators and angering liberal groups worried about his future votes
on such issues as abortion, affirmative action and church-state
relations.
   Souter, because of his relative anonymity, did not face the same
immediate and fierce liberal opposition that confronted Robert H.
Bork before his high court nomination was rejected by the Senate in
1987.
   But many of the groups that helped defeat Bork say the onus is
on Souter to dispel their doubts.
   Nan Aron of the Alliance for Justice said Souter's record
``points to rejection. It is incumbent on him to reassure us that
he would respect individual rights. If we are not satisfied with
his answers, we will ask the U.S. Senate to reject'' his nomination.
   The liberal National Organization for Women and the National
Lawyers Guild already have announced their opposition.
   Other liberal groups, such as People for the American Way, the
National Abortion Rights Action League and the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights, have refrained from opposing Souter's
nomination outright.
   Ralph Neas of the Leadership Conference said ``There is nothing,
or little, in Judge Souter's record to demonstrate a commitment to
civil rights or social justice.''
   The consensus so far: There is not enough to derail his
nomination.
   Even some Souter opponents concede that the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, which has focused public attention elsewhere, benefits
Souter's chance of being confirmed as the Supreme Court's 105th
justice.
   Some conservative groups, such as Coalitions for America and
Concerned Women for America, are backing Souter's nomination.
   The groups supporting Souter say he should not be asked about
his personal views on social issues and past Supreme Court rulings.
That would preclude, for example, asking Souter his opinion of the
1973 decision in Roe vs. Wade that legalized abortion.
   The groups opposing Souter or leaning that way say such
questions, or some very similar, are precisely what the Senate must
ask to determine Souter's fitness for the high court.
   Liberal groups point to a brief filed by New Hampshire when
Souter was attorney general in voicing fears that he is
anti-abortion. They also point to a speech he gave in the late
1970s to question his commitment to affirmative action.
   As attorney general, Souter once defended a since-invalidated
New Hampshire law that provided for the flying of flags at half
staff at state office buildings on Good Friday. The liberals say
that action indicates Souter's insensitivity to the
constitutionally required separation of church and state.
   Liberal groups also have found about a dozen opinions Souter
wrote while he was a New Hampshire Supreme Court justice. They say
the opinions show a lack of commitment to the rights of minorities
and women.
   The preliminary infighting about the Senate's proper role
reflects the stakes.
   Souter, if confirmed, would replace retired Justice William J.
Brennan, the court's leading liberal for three decades, at a time
when the court is closely divided on abortion, affirmative action,
church-state relations and criminal justice matters.
   In contrast, the 1986 nomination of conservative Antonin Scalia
caused few waves. He was nominated, and won easy confirmation, to
replace another conservative, retired Chief Justice Warren E.
Burger.
   Among the Judiciary Committee's 14 members, Souter's most
probing interrogators likely will be Democratic Sens. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts and Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio. They are
the committee's two most ardent liberals.
   But Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a conservative, also says he
intends to ask Souter to flesh out his views on significant legal
issues, including abortion. Grassley is strongly anti-abortion.
   The committee's other members are Democrats Joseph Biden of
Delaware, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Paul Simon of Illinois, Herb
Kohl of Wisconsin, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Howell Heflin of
Alabama, and Republicans Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Orrin
Hatch of Utah, Alan Simpson of Wyoming, Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.

   Rep. Thomas R. Carper trounced his challenger
in Saturday's Democratic primary as he sought a fifth term in
Congress.
   With 96 percent of the vote counted, Carper had 24,978 votes to
Daniel Rappa's 2,535.
   ``I've never won more than 68 percent of the voters on anything.
Winning over 80 percent is hard to believe,'' said Carper, 43,
proclaiming victory.
   Rappa told his supporters, ``You have my heartfelt thanks. You
did the best you can do. It just wasn't enough.''
   His supporters wanted Carper to defeat Rappa, who was making his
first bid for public office, by a landslide to set the stage for a
gubernatorial bid in 1992. Rappa is challenging Carper's actions in
the savings and loan crisis.
   Saturday's winner will face Republican businessman Ralph O.
Williams, also a political newcomer, in the November elections.
   The state elections commissioner's office said 126,160 Democrats
were registered to vote in the only statewide race in the primary.

   Rappa, 66, a millionaire developer and one-time contributor to
Carper's campaigns, engaged in name-calling and accused Carper of
becoming a millionaire while in Congress.
   In a direct mail leaflet concerning the savings and loan
industry scandal, Rappa said Carper was ``wined and dined'' while
taxpayers were being robbed of $500 billion, referring to the
estimated cost of the savings and loan bailout.
   He criticized Carper for accepting about $150,000 in campaign
contributions from financial institutions, including about $9,000
from savings and loans.
   Carper, a member of the House Banking Committee, defended his
efforts in the savings and loan bailout. He attempted
unsuccessfully to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp. by tripling savings and loan insurance premiums
rather than using taxpayers' money.
   Carper said the primary challenge resulted from spite.
   Last year, he led an effort to oust New Castle County Democratic
Party Chairman Eugene T. Reed Sr., who has since been indicted on
charges of political corruption.
   Reed backs Rappa.
   ``When I led the effort to reform the Democratic Party to throw
out the old leadership, I knew there would be a price I had to pay
for doing so,'' Carper said. ``This primary is payback that I had
anticipated.''
   Carper said he wanted to win by a large margin because a close
victory would send ``the wrong kind of signal and message to those
who might like to take our party back to the old days of
smoke-filled rooms, closed doors and deals under the table.''

<HEAD>Justice Department, Again: Roe vs. Wade Should be Overturned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration reiterated in a
Supreme Court court brief Friday that the 1973 decision legalizing
abortion should be overturned. But it stopped short of asking the
justices to do so in pending cases involving New York City family
planning clinics.
   The Justice Department stated its well-known views on the
landmark Roe vs. Wade decision in a brief filed to defend Reagan
administration regulations that prohibit government-financed family
planning clinics from providing abortion counseling.
   The regulations promulgated by the Department of Health and
Human Services in 1988 have been challenged by family planning
clinics, Planned Parenthood and other organizations.
   The brief filed by Solicitor General Kenneth Starr said ``we
continue to believe that Roe was wrongly decided and should be
overruled.''
   The Supreme Court's ``conclusions in Roe that there is a
fundamental right to an abortion and that the government has no
compelling interest in protecting pre-natal human life throughout
pregnancy find no support in the text, structure, or history of the
Constitution,'' Starr argued.
   But the Justice Department stopped short of asking the court to
use the two cases before it as the occassion for undoing Roe vs.
Wade. Instead, the Justice Department offered a narrow defense of
the 1988 regulations.
   The executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action
League seized on the brief as an occasion to emphasize its concern
about the nomination of David Souter to the court, which it said
should be opposed if Souter does not recognize a right to abortion.
   ``This is direct evidence that there is reason to fear Judge
Souter,'' said Kate Michelman. ``The administration must feel
confident they will soon have the votes to overturn Roe.''
   The National Right to Life Committee, on the other hand, said it
was glad the administration had presented a ``firm, principled
defense of unborn babies.''
   The clinics are financed under a $200 million a year program
under Title 10 of the Public Health Service Act. The law forbids
the clinics from performing abortions but earlier regulations had
allowed counselors to advise women that terminating a pregnancy was
an option.
   The court is considering two cases from New York City in which
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the 1988 regulations
on a 2-1 vote. But some other federal appeals courts have ruled the
regulations were unconstitutional.
   The Justice Department disputed the petitioners claim that the
regulations violate the constitutional protection of freedom of
speech. ``The grant recipients's employees, as a matter of the
employment relationship, are obligated to comply with the grant
recipient's directions,'' the department said.
   ``Thus, any limitation on the employees' freedom of expression
arises from their voluntary decision to enter a particular
employment relationship. Nor do the regulations infringe on the
right to abortion that is recognized by Roe vs. Wade,'' said the
department.
   ``While under Roe the government may not prohibit a woman from
choosing to have a first trimester abortion, this court has
repeatedly held that the government is not obligated to provide the
means to exercise any such right,'' the department said.

   Attorney General Godfrey de
Castro resigned his post following the dismissal of charges against
a 15-year-old who confessed to more than a dozen rapes.
   Gov. Alexander Farrelly accepted de Castro's resignation and
named attorney Rosalie Ballantine of the Justice Department as
acting attorney general. Officials said local newspaper articles
this week detailing the dismissal of charges led to de Castro's
resignation on Thursday.
   De Castro had been the target of a woman's group, a senator and
several police officials who said they were ``outraged'' the case
against the self-confessed rapist was dropped.
   De Castro said in a letter to the governor a report that he
submitted to the governor on Tuesday contained ``misleading
information'' he received from his staff. The report apparently
concerned the rape case.
   ``In accordance with my own personal code of honor I am,
therefore, constrained to resign,'' de Castro said. ``I regret that
this had to take place, but I cannot rely on representations by my
own staff, and I will not hold you responsible for the failures of
my department,'' de Castro wrote.

   A record 233 murders were committed in Los
Angeles County last month, pushing the homicide rate for the first
eight months of this year up 20 percent over the same period last
year, an official said Friday.
   The old record of 227 was set in July, said coroner's spokesman
Bob Dambacher. He said 104 of the August murders occurred in the
city of Los Angeles.
   Dambacher said 1,628 killings were reported in the county
between January and August, 20.1 percent more than the same period
last year.
   Police Cmdr. William Booth said drugs and gang activity fueled
much of the violence.
   ``Fifty-five percent of the homicides are narcotic-related in
one way or another,'' Booth said. ``Gang violence is 30 percent of
the cases, but the gang problem and narcotics go hand in hand.''
   The county's murder rate rose steadily over the past two years,
Dambacher said. There were 2,091 unnatural deaths reported in 1989,
a 10.5 increase over 1988, he said.

   A Forsyth County teen-ager who held
classmates at gunpoint inside a local school was charged Friday
with 53 counts of kidnapping.
   Authorities also filed nine counts of kidnapping by ransom and
two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon against
17-year-old Randy Floyd Addis, said Forsyth Deputy Sheriff Kevin
Wallace.
   Addis, a high school sophomore, was charged as an adult Thursday
with kidnapping and weapons violations. The kidnapping charges
Friday represented one count for each of the 53 hostages he
initially held Thursday, Wallace said.
   Addis, armed with several guns, released hostages throughout the
day until he held only nine, police said. He demanded a school bus
and $3,000 before becoming dizzy and surrendering to police.
   No one was injured during the five-hour ordeal.
   Addis, who reportedly suffers emotional and health problems,
underwent psychiatric testing Friday.

   Burma's military government, which ignored
May's election landslide for the opposition, announced Friday it
had arrested the acting opposition leader and five other key
dissidents.
   Col. Than Tun, deputy chief of military intelligence, said six
leaders of the National League for Democracy were arrested
Thursday. They included its acting leader, Kyi Maung, and his
deputy, Chit Hlaing.
   Gen. Saw Maung's government put the League's two main leaders,
Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, under house arrest in July 1989. Tin
Oo was later sentenced to three years in jail at hard labor.
   On Thursday, Japanese diplomats reported that Saw Maung told a
visiting Japanese legislator last week he was willing to free Ms.
Suu Kyi if she accepted foreign exile or gave up politics.
   Thursday's arrests deprive the League of the leaders who steered
it to victory in the May 27 national election, Burma's first free
poll in three decades. The League won 392 of 485 contested seats,
but the military has ignored its demands to transfer power.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Dillen said, ``We
strongly deplore continued arrests by the Burmese military regime
on political charges.''
   He said the United States regarded the arrests as an attempt by
the military to stifle legitimate political activities and thwart
implementation of the May election results.
   The government has issued warnings recently against protests to
mark the anniversary of the military's seizure of power in
September 1988. At that time, troops killed several thousand people
in crushing a national movement for democracy.
   At a news briefing Friday, Saw Maung repeated the warnings. He
also ordered Buddhist clergy, who have been at the forefront of
recent anti-government dissent, not to meddle in politics.
   ``(The government) is ruling the country according to martial
law. Our duty is to maintain law and order, and any attempt to
disrupt these objectives will not be tolerated,'' he said.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon have reported a heavy troop
presence in the capital in recent days. One diplomat, contacted by
telephone from Bangkok, gave two possible explanations for the
latest arrests.
   ``One is that they are pre-emptive; the other that they are a
deliberate ploy to stir up unrest to create an excuse for an even
heavier clampdown,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Both Kyi Maung and his deputy are members of the League's
Central Executive Committee. Both won parliamentary seats in the
May election.
   Than Tun said they were detained under the Official Secrets Act
and would be tried soon. He gave no details of the alleged offenses.
   However, the diplomat said the pretext for the arrests appeared
to be that the two had circulated to regional League leaders a
confidential letter written by the powerful head of military
intelligence, Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt.
   The four others arrested Thursday were from Mandalay, Burma's
second- largest city. Ohn Kyaing, Thein Tan, Ye Myint Aung and Sein
Hla Aung were accused of instigating unrest there on Aug. 8, the
anniversary of a 1988 general strike.
   The U.S. human rights group Asia Watch said in an August report
that thousands of political prisoners were believed to be held in
Burmese jails and that torture was widespread.
   On Aug. 8, troops reportedly killed two Buddhist monks and two
students who were demonstrating peacefully in Mandalay. Days
earlier a soldier reportedly bayonetted a student protester in the
face.
   Kyi Maung, a retired 72-year-old army colonel, was considered a
moderate with the potential to mediate between the military and the
more radical members of his own party.

   Ray Ball was watching the news with his
wife, Twyla, when the would-be robber came to the door.
   So Ball, an 81-year-old retired timber worker, did the only
thing he could do. He slammed the door in the man's face and went
for his .38.
   ``I saw a guy come across the lawn by this window,'' Ball said
Thursday morning. ``I didn't wait for him to knock on the door; I
don't know why.
   ``I opened the door and he had the gun like this,'' Ball said,
standing like a marksman with his right arm held straight out from
his shoulder.
   ``He was pointing it straight at me and said, `Get 'em up!' The
very second he did that, I slammed the door shut,'' Ball said.
   ``I hollered at my wife to get down and I went in another room
and got a .38 Special of my own.''
   The incident occurred shortly after 10 p.m. Wednesday. Ball said
he shut off the lights and checked each window while his wife
called police.
   When a police officer arrived minutes later, Ball was in the
yard with his pistol. ``I think he was a little surprised when I
got out there,'' Ball said of the officer. ``He didn't know me from
the other guy.''
   Police questioned two men and a woman nearby, including a man
with a handgun, but the investigation continued.

<HEAD>Unions Agree in Principle to Negotiate Concessions with Post</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The unions at the New York Post conditionally
agreed Friday to yield $17 million in concessions that the Post
says it needs to stay in business through next week.
   The unions said they believed the Post needs concessions and
agreed in principle to negotiate them. They also asked for and got
an outside audit of the Post's books and urged the paper not to
change its contracts with labor.
   ``We are going to do everything possible to help the Post stay
in business,'' said George McDonald, president of the Allied
Printing Trades Council, an umbrella group for unions at the
tabloid. ``If we happen to fail, neither side is going to blame the
other.''
   Post spokesman Howard Rubenstein said changing the contract
would not be necessary as long as the newspaper got economic relief.
   ``We continue to be optimistic that working with our unions will
lead to a resolution,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, Post Publisher Peter S. Kalikow said the paper was
running an annual deficit of $25 million to $27 million and that he
needed the unions to kick in $17 million in concessions or the
paper would close by Sept. 15.
   If the unions are satisfied with a weekend audit by Peat Marwick
Main &amp; Co., negotiations could begin Monday or Tuesday. Any cuts
would be effective for the life of the current contracts, which
expire March 30.
   Since Tuesday, the unions have been meeting with Post officials,
learning what each group would have to sacrifice.
   The Newspaper Guild, which represents 337 reporters, editors,
sales and clerical workers, was asked to take a 30 percent pay cut
and drop about 40 jobs from its jurisdiction, union members said.
   Guild President Barry Lipton said the pay cut actually amounted
to a 46 percent cut: a 30 percent cut, a 2{-hour increase in the
work week (equalling an 11 percent cut) and a 5 percent hike in
workers' out-of-pocket health costs.
   At a raucous membership meeting Thursday night, 300 members
unanimously rejected the package as ``obscene and degrading,''
Lipton said.
   Michael Alvino, president of the drivers' union, said his union
was asked to take $8 million in cuts or 54 percent of its payroll,
the largest hit asked of any union. He said the Post asked for
personnel cuts and slashed overtime.
   After assessing the proposals each union was given, the Allied
met Friday with Daniel F. Cremins, Post executive vice president,
and Richard T. Nasti, vice president. Lipton said the 40-job
jurisdiction cut was dropped.
   The unions told Cremins and Nasti that they, too, wanted certain
concessions in order to negotiate.
   Aside from Peat Marwick's audit and the contract remaining
intact, the unions also want stock in the Post and at least one
seat on the board of directors, said Theodore Kheel, an unpaid
legal adviser to the unions.
   ``I think the Post will agree to this. There was no violent
reaction'' at Friday's meeting when the items were brought up,
Kheel said.
   Kheel said they wanted the stock and board seat because they
would expect The New York Times, which is financially healthy, to
seek concessions equal to any the unions give the Post.
   Kheel said it would, in effect, block the Times from asking for
concessions since the Times is unlikely to place any union members
on its board.

<TEXT>
   Lt. Gov. Martha Griffiths resumed her
criticism of Gov. James Blanchard on Friday by hinting her
replacement on the Democratic ticket is unqualified.
   Griffiths said in an interview for ``Face to Face with Connie
Chung'' on CBS News that Olivia Maynard, 54, of Flint, had no
experience as an elected official.
   ``I don't know what she knows about government,'' Griffiths
said. ``She has never been in the government except for this
running the (Office of Services to the Aging).''
   The 78-year-old Griffiths also criticized her boss when asked if
she thought he was hiding behind a woman's skirts by offering
Maynard for a network interview rather than himself.
   ``Well, he always wants somebody else to take the blame for
everything,'' she said. ``But everybody else does, and he's real
good at this. At letting somebody else take the blame. He takes the
credit. Every politician does that if they can, every politician.''
   Griffiths was dumped from the ticket after Blanchard decided she
was unable to step in and take over the governor's duties at a
moment's notice.
   She reacted bitterly to the decision at first, then seemed to
make up with the governor in a visit to Mackinac Island, Mich.,
last week where she kissed him and then walked arm and arm with him.
   She also told him at that meeting that she was not referring to
him directly when she said the worst thing about politics is that
some ``son of a bitch'' will dump someone after getting what he or
she wants.
   Griffiths is widely credited with helping Blanchard, 48, to his
first gubernatorial victory in 1982.
   Maynard is a former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party and
has been director of the state Office of Services to the Aging
since 1983.

   China wants a speedy restoration of relations
with the United States, China's vice premier told former Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger on Friday.
   Kissinger arrived Friday afternoon on what the Chinese described
as a goodwill visit at the invitation of the Foreign Ministry. It
is his 16th trip to China since 1971, when he visited secretly and
helped open the way for establishment of diplomatic ties.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Vice Premier Wu Xueqian
told Kissinger at a welcoming banquet that his past visits helped
promote relations between their countries.
   ``We believe this Beijing visit by Dr. Kissinger is bound to
achieve positive results,'' Wu added.
   The Foreign Ministry has refused to answer questions about the
visit or say who Kissinger will see. China considers him an old
friend and on past visits he has met with top leaders, including
Premier Li Peng and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin.
   Kissinger also remains influential in Washington, and China
apparently hopes he will press for restoration of full U.S.-Chinese
contacts. The United States has cut off most high-level exchanges
since the June 1989 army killings of pro-democracy protesters and
continues to block all but ``humanitarian'' loans by the World Bank.
   Business, cultural and education exchanges also have not fully
returned to their levels before the protests.
   Washington wants Beijing to improve its human rights record and
release thousands of people still jailed for taking part in the
pro-democracy protests.
   Kissinger has argued against isolating China, and he visited
Beijing last November.

   A sniper's rooftop suicide before hundreds of
transfixed onlookers was captured by cameras Friday, and local
Pittsburgh newscasts did not air the videotape while national CNN
Headline News did.
   Paul Fisher, a Pittsburgh man in his mid- to late 30s, used a
rifle and handgun to keep police at bay for 5{ hours before
shooting himself in the head and falling from atop a 16-story
building.
   The city's three network-affiliated television stations _ WTAE,
WPXI and KDKA _ did not broadcast their footage of the suicide.
   ``We have a stationwide policy regarding suicides. We don't
broadcast them, and that applies to this case,'' said KDKA
executive news producer Jocelyn Howe. ``More so, in this case
footage lent nothing to the telling of the story.''
   ``That's not our style. We don't do things like that here,''
said Tom Loebig, executive producer of news at WPXI. ``I don't feel
anyone taking their own life should be shown on television.''
   In 1986, Pennsylvania state treasurer R. Budd Dwyer killed
himself at a news conference he called to discuss a federal
indictment against him.
   WPXI, which has since changed management, broadcast videotape of
Dwyer placing a gun in his mouth and firing.
   KDKA and WTAE broadcast parts of the news conference but not the
suicide.
   At WTAE, News Director Joe Rovitto told the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette it was against station policy to broadcast suicides.
   Before Fisher died, Rovitto said: ``We've alerted everybody that
if he makes a move that looks like he's going to jump to get the
camera off him immediately, even if it's a sloppy pan.''
   The station broadcast a freeze-framed image of Fisher's hat in
the air during his fall.
   The three stations, Cable News Network and the CNN Headline News
broadcast live reports from the scene throughout the day.
   Headline News, a division of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting
System, broadcast videotape of the suicide.
   ``The reason we did it is that we were covering the story when
it first broke and we were continuing to tell the story,'' said Meg
Andre, a supervising producer at Headline News.
   The station aired the suicide once every hour Friday evening and
planned to reduce that overnight, she said.
   CNN received the same footage but ``saw no reason to run it,''
said supervising producer David Bernknopf. ``No one other than the
gunman himself was harmed. It didn't make sense to run it.''
   Saturday's editions of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette included a
front-page photograph of Fisher tumbling from the apartment
building.
   ``We may get some mail on this,'' said David Guo, staff
development editor.
   The Associated Press transmitted two photographs, one showing
Fisher falling and the other showing him holding a rifle as he
stood on the building's edge.
   At The Pittsburgh Press, editors intended to meet late Friday to
decide on photo coverage of the suicide in Saturday afternoon's
paper.

   The United States will dispatch 27,000 metric
tons of emergency food supplies _ worth more than $12 million _ to
Jordanian camps holding tens of thousands of refugees from Iraq and
Kuwait, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Friday.
   The White House, meanwhile, announced that President Bush had
released $10 million from an emergency fund to aid refugees in
Jordan and other Middle East countries.
   Yeutter said his department, in cooperation with the
government's Agency for International Development, has started
buying 20,000 metric tons of rice, 2,000 tons of vegetable oil, and
5,000 tons of wheat flour.
   The food is to be shipped from ports on the Gulf of Mexico by
Sept. 30, the announcement said.
   Spokeswoman Kelly Shipp said the rice was valued at $6 million,
the oil at $5 million and the wheat flour at less than $1 million.
   Yeutter said the commodities are being made available through
the World Food Program under the U.S. Food for Peace program. Title
II of the program provides for emergency and long-term humanitarian
food aid.
   ``This action is being taken for humanitarian reasons to help
alleviate the suffering of the large number of people of many
nationalities who have fled Iraq and Kuwait following the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait,'' he said.
   Jordanian officials have estimated that more than 250,000
foreigners have crossed into Jordan since Iraq invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2. Nearly 100,000 are still stranded at refugee camps.
   In addition, an estimated 225,000 Egyptians are trying to cross
into Jordan from Iraq, Jordanian officials said.
   On Air Force One carrying President Bush to his summit with
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the White House announced
Friday night the $10 million released by Bush would be divided $7.5
million for transportation of refugees to their homes and $2.5
million for private relief organizations.
   The sum brings the total U.S. cash emergency relief aid to $28
million.
   Richard Haass, a Middle East specialist on the National Security
Council staff, said Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady were asking allies for commitment
of ``spare air assets'' to help move refugees to their homes.
   ``People are at their breaking point,'' Haas said.
   ``That's clearly our priority, to get people back home to their
countries. ... We don't want to build a permanent refugee
population.''

<HEAD>Former Union Boss Pleads Innocent To Murder Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union boss accused of ordering the 1981 deaths
of two union activists who opposed Philippine dictator Ferdinand
Marcos pleaded innocent Friday to two counts of aggravated
first-degree murder.
   Constantine ``Tony'' Baruso, who earlier was found liable for
millions of dollars in damages in a civil lawsuit filed by the
victims' families, said nothing but his name during the hearing
before King County Superior Court Judge Frank Sullivan.
   A pretrial hearing before Judge James Bates was set for Sept. 24.
   Baruso, a prominent member of the Seattle Philippine-American
community and a longtime ally of Marcos, who died in exile last
year, was arrested Wednesday at his home in Tacoma.
   If convicted, the 62-year-old Baruso would face either the death
penalty or life in prison without possibility of parole. He
remained in the King County Jail on $500,000 bail.
   Baruso is accused of arranging the fatal shootings of Silme
Domingo and Gene Viernes in the Alaska Cannery Workers Union
offices June 1, 1981. Baruso was the union president when the two
were killed.
   Besides their union work, the men opposed Marcos, who as
president imposed martial law.
   King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng said prosecutors hoped to
prove Baruso conspired with Marcos and Dr. Leonilo Malabed, a
Marcos friend in San Francisco, to kill the activists.
   Three men, members of a Filipino gang called Tulisan, were
convicted of the murders at a criminal trials in 1981 and 1982.
   Authorities identified Baruso's handgun as the murder weapon,
but said he claimed the gun had been stolen.
   Maleng said the charges against Baruso arose from information
revealed during the trial of a civil lawsuit filed by the victims'
families.
   A U.S. District Court jury last December awarded the families
$15.1 million from Marcos' estate and from his widow, Imelda.
   U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein later found Baruso and
Malabed liable for an additional $8.4 million.
   Baruso testified in both the criminal and civil trials, but
repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination.

   An American wounded by Iraqi police in
Kuwait while trying to evade capture was identified Friday by his
mother, who said State Department officials were trying to get U.S.
authorities in to see him.
   The State Department said Thursday that Iraqi authorities
informed U.S. officials that an American was wounded at his
apartment in Kuwait City. Officials said he is expected to be
discharged from a hospital shortly but will remain in Iraqi custody.
   State Department spokesman Mark Dillen refused to identify the
American Thursday, but Mrs. Cullen Hoffman of Columbus told The
Associated Press late Friday that her son, Miles Hoffman, was the
victim.
   Mrs. Hoffman, who refused to give her first name, said she
didn't know her son's condition.
   ``The State Department only said that he had been entered into
the hospital and they were trying to see him,'' she said. ``He was
admitted to the hospital and they finally had been granted the
privilege of somebody seeing him.''
   Hoffman was a financial analyst and investor for the Kuwaiti
government. His brother, Chancellor Hoffman, said in an earlier
interview that the family had not heard from Miles Hoffman but that
they did not believe he was among the thousands of Americans held
hostage by Iraq.
   On Thursday, Dillen said an account of the shooting was provided
to a U.S. consular officer, who interviewed a friend of the
victim's.
   The friend, who was taken into custody by the Iraqis, said the
American was wounded in the forearm while trying to escape through
an apartment window. He was taken initially to one hospital in
Kuwait, then to another.
   Dillen said Iraqi officials in Baghdad confirmed the injury
Thursday but said it was not serious.
   ``They say that he will be discharged from the hospital within
24 hours, but will remain in their custody,'' he said. ``They
promise us consular access at that time.''

   A statue of a partially nude woman was
removed from a sculpture exhibit in the same city where members of
the rap group 2 Live Crew were arrested on obscenity charges.
   The 42-piece exhibit that opened Thursday at the Art and Culture
Center did so without a life-sized statue called Ms. America. The
statue's exposed nipples are pierced with hoops held together by a
gold chain and the torso is covered with colorful tattoos.
   After consulting with Mayor Sal Oliveri, center Director Wendy
Blazier decided this week to pull the statue from the show, Oliveri
said. The mayor said Blazier, a city employee, told him she was
concerned the sculpture would offend someone.
   Oliveri, who has had no qualms about criticizing art and music
in Hollywood, said he never implied to Blazier that Ms. America be
banned from the exhibit, which features the work of Florida artists.

   ``This is a suicide note. I just wanted the police to kill me,''
said a message that WTAE-TV reported was found on Fisher's body.
   ``He said he was going to jump since we wouldn't assassinate
him,'' DeRoy said.
   Fisher, who had a history of mental illness, fired at least 12
shots, one at an unmarked police car and 11 randomly into the air,
authorities said. No one was injured by those shots.

   The bottom section of the solid-fuel booster fell 100 feet while
being hoisted to a desert test stand Friday by a 900-ton crane,
igniting upon impact, Air Force Maj. Dick Cole said.
   The fire forced the evacuation of about 1,200 people from a

radiation hazard.
   ``It actually started burning. We call it an ignition rather

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are getting to the point where they
will have no other choice but to cut public and private spending
and, who knows, maybe even taxes.
   As the economy slows, the strains and the pains are showing up
in the form of bank and savings and loan failures, personal and
business bankruptcies, late and often incomplete repayments
everywhere, and in government budget deficits.
   Recognition that spending must be supported by income was a long
time coming, because government, business and individuals had
myriad ways in which to avoid facing the facts. There were lots of
ways to hide.
   The federal government, for instance, simply tossed certain
costly items off the budget, business kidded itself into believing
sales would soar and enable it to pay off junk bonds, and
individuals discovered easy credit.
   The latter also discovered the bankruptcy laws and utilized
them. Purdue University's credit research center reports that the
number of filings for personal bankruptcy in 1989 was 3.5 times the
filings of a decade ago.
   Past-due real estate loans at banks climbed $3.2 billion in the
April-June period. Corporate junk bond defaults so far this year
total $9.4 billion, or $600 million more than all of last year.
State governments are in deep trouble.
   Even Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who once suggested
his colleagues lacked courage in seeking to avoid spending
increases, has been forced to cut.
   The biggest blow to state budgets is the economic decline, which
has cut deeply into revenues. But if it weren't for higher tax
rates, the deficits in many states would be higher still.
   State tax revenues in fiscal 1989 rose nearly $20 billion to
$284 billion, a 7.5 percent one-year jump, according to the Tax
Foundation. To a great extent, those tax increases had hidden the
problems _ until the downturn.
   And now, with economies receding, outrage against high taxes is
growing.
   The foundation study showed state tax collections from personal
income last year rose 10.7 percent; from corporate income, 10.4
percent; and from sales tax, 7.3 percent. Still, the financial
problems persist. Cuts are inevitable.
   Now that individuals, governments and businesses seem to have
few additional places in which to hide from reality, several other
factors may have turned against them.
   Interest rates, for example, may remain stuck at fairly high
levels because the tenuous Mideast situation could deprive the
Federal Reserve of rate-cutting options. That same Mideast problem
could create higher energy prices, add to domestic inflation and
conceivably add to the Federal budget deficit.
   Evidence of budgetary strains are everywhere. Credit as a
percentage of individual income is near record highs. Debt has
replaced equity in thousands of companies. Corporations are forced
to cut down on employee benefits.
   Still, economists who have observed the developing strains do
not view the situation as hopeless.
   A good many of them say the renewed sense of reality is the
first step toward putting the financial house in order, and that
without more orderly finances any future upturn would be endangered.
   In that sense, the inability of Americans to find any more
financial deceits to hide behind might, in the long run, be good
news.

   Sam Raimi has this thing about monsters.
   Take ``King Kong.'' So what if the great ape gets fresh with Fay
Wray and bumps off several others? As the movie ends in gorilla
warfare from the top of the Empire State Building, Raimi's hoping
the big guy comes out unharmed.
   ``There was something fascinating about King Kong on the Empire
State Building,'' said the filmmaker, who has a surprise hit with
the comic-horror film ``Darkman.''
   ``When they began shooting him, I thought, `Don't hurt him, he
just wants to be loved, to be understood.' I was fascinated when
they were able to terrify me with a character and then make me feel
sympathy for him. You had something that you're repulsed by and
attracted to at the same time.''
   So Raimi asks forgiveness for the title character of
``Darkman,'' a monstrous looking fellow beyond the pale of love and
plastic surgery. Liam Neeson stars as Dr. Payton Westlake, an
affable young scientist whose face is scarred beyond recognition by
a gang of vicious hit men.
   Initially, all Westlake wants is a reunion with the woman
(Frances McDormand) he has asked to marry. But his anger brings out
the beast in him, making Darkman dangerous to villians and
amusement park vendors alike, turning his life into a publicity
campaign that asks, ``Who is Darkman?''
   ``This is a story about a man who was handsome and becomes
physically and emotionally a hideous man,'' Raimi explained.
   ``Darkman is just a comic book character, but we did try to show
him as a man who wanted to be loved and wanted to be accepted.
Because of his growing alienation and frustration, dealing with
rejection by the woman who loves him, the fact he continously
failed. That's why he becomes a bad character as opposed to just
the way he looks.''
   Who is Sam Raimi? He's a native of Royal Oak, Mich., who began
making films at age 11 and collecting comic books much sooner (he
has thousands of them). Outside of The Three Stooges and Jerry
Lewis, he didn't watch movies as a kid, so ``Darkman'' is not
simply a takeoff on horror films but also a personal statement
about beauty and self-esteem.
   ``All men at times think they're the ugly ones,'' he said.
``Maybe they're rejected because they're so hideous. I'm sure I've
been in a role like the Darkman. You consider yourself ugly and are
frustrated with your failure and feel low about yourself.
   ``I understand the loneliness aspect and rejection aspect.''
   After graduating from high school, he planned on studying film
but was encouraged by his father to major in literature and history
instead. He attended Michigan State University, dividing his time
among Shakespeare, ancient Greece and the rise and fall of modern
movie-making.
   ``My brother, Ivan, and I created a film society, the Michigan
State University Society for Filmmaking,'' he recalled. ``It was a
mechanism by which we could show our movies on campus and charge
$1.25 per ticket.
   ``That was the best training I ever had. Kids were vocal and
would shout out `This sucks.' They didn't know the filmmaker was
running the projector and the star was taking the tickets.''
   Two years of college were more than enough for Raimi, who
dropped out in 1978 for a life of busing tables and plotting
stories.
   ``The Evil Dead,'' a low-budget horror film, came out in 1982
overseas and 1983 in the United States, and the sequel, ``The Evil
Dead II: Dead by Dawn,'' was released in 1986. In between, Raimi
made ``Crime Wave,'' which the director dismissed as ``not very
good.''
   He began writing ``Darkman'' three years ago, submitting a
30-page story to Universal Pictures. The studio liked the idea and
suggested to Raimi he get a screenwriter to help flesh out the
story.
   ``We hired Chuck Pfarrer, who wrote the original script for
`Navy SEALS,' which I liked very much. I said, `Chuck, here's the
story. Would you be interested?' He wrote the first script, then my
brother wrote the second, third and fourth.''
   Twelves drafts were needed before everyone was satisfied (Raimi
and four others share screenplay credits) and the director's
friends, filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen offered advice and jokes.
   Comparisons to ``Batman'' and ``Dick Tracy'' are inevitable, but
Raimi was more interested in the comic strips than the films.
Watching a movie doesn't have to be different from reading the
funny papers, he figures, that's why he carefully strung the sight
gags together, making ``Darkman'' a comic phantom story that pumps
a little life into ``Biff!,'' ``Bam!'' and ``Pow!''
   ``Comic books approach each frame that mostly clearly depicts
the action and is their most dramatic representation of the action.
I took a similar appraoch when I directed `Darkman,' even at the
cost of losing reality or drama or melodrama,'' he said.
   ``I wanted to keep the audience jumping, laughing, keep them
entertained.''

<TEXT>
   ``They say I have horns and fangs,'' opium
warlord Khun Sa declared with a laugh, curling fingers at his
temples to illustrate. ``Actually, I am a king without a crown.''
   ``They'' are American narcotics officials, who indeed describe
Khun Sa in devilish terms like ``The Prince of Darkness.'' They say
he is one of the world's main drug traffickers, exporting death
from opium poppy fields and jungle laboratories that refine the
sticky extract into heroin.
   His ``kingdom'' is a large slice of the Golden Triangle, the
tri-border area of Burma, Laos and Thailand where Khun Sa has been
an often dominant and ruthless figure for three decades.
   The 56-year-old survivor of battles, imprisonment and
double-crossing deals boasts that he controls 80 percent of the
drugs in Burma's Shan State. Khun Sa also claims his ultimate aim
is to eradicate narcotics, which flow by the ton to what he
describes as ``the drug-crazed West.''
   American officials, citing evidence of his involvement in
large-scale heroin shipments to the United States, indicted Khun Sa
in March and threatened to ``go after him if he can be located.''
   Going after Khun Sa would appear difficult, but his location is
no more secret than was that of Gen. Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian
strongman and alleged drug trafficker ousted and captured by U.S.
military forces.
   Khun Sa's headquarters is in a long, idyllic valley about nine
miles inside Burma, astride a road leading from the Thai frontier.
The few reporters invited to visit receive a friendly reception
after a grueling 11-hour mule ride.
   Ho Mong is neither the stereotype of a smuggler's lair nor a
plush hideaway like those of Latin American cocaine lords. It
includes an orderly village of several thousand people, schools, an
87-bed hospital, a large Buddhist temple and Tiger Camp, where Khun
Sa's Muang Tai Army is trained.
   ``The world sees me in a different way,'' he said in an
interview. Khun Sa wants the world to view him as a rebel general
fighting the Burmese government to liberate the Shan, one of many
ethnic minority groups suffering under an autocratic regime.
   With a motley group of Shan and Chinese, Khun Sa has built a
non-military organization they claim has won the loyalties of
several million people in Shan state. It includes a constitution
modeled on that of the United States and several political organs,
the most powerful led by Khun Sa's uncle, Khun Seng.
   He clearly commands the loyalty of many Shans, in Burma and
across the border in Thailand, but has a poor record of fighting
the Burmese government, which he described as ``the great enemy.''
   In fact, he has been on its side in the past and is shunned
today by the Karen, Kachin, Karenni and other rebel ethnic groups.
   Khun Sa acknowledges taxing opium that moves through his
territory, but denies refining it or trafficking in heroin. Western
and Thai narcotics sources say his empire includes laboratories
along the Thai-Burmese border and inside Laos.
   The opium warlord argues that, for 17 years, he has proposed
that the West buy the opium harvests he gathers and cooperate with
him to eradicate the drug problem at its roots. There have been no
takers.
   ``We have the opium; we have the heroin,'' said Seng Joseph, one
of Khun Sa's aides. ``We're the only ones who can stop the flow.''
   ``The DEA cannot stop it in a hundred years,'' he said of the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
   Several U.S. officials have visited Khun Sa over the years, and
he recently sent a videotape to President George Bush.
   It urges Bush to accept what Khun Sa presents as a six-year plan
to eradicate narcotics and turn the poverty-stricken Golden
Triangle into a ``World Garden'' of all-weather roads, tourist
hotels, international airport and prosperous peasants who no longer
must grow opium for survival.
   It was midmorning at Tiger Camp. Lingering mists swept the
surrounding hills as Khun Sa inspected recruits on the training
field. He was dressed neatly in light blue trousers and a striped,
white shirt.
   When asked if he was wealthy, Khun Sa said his expenses were too
high, especially for the army.
   ``Shan state is like a lawless state,'' he said. ``The people
who own more guns have the power.''
   He claims to have 20,000 men under arms, most of them teen-agers
from peasant families who apparently are happy to join up for the
monthly pay of 150 baht, the equivalent of $6. U.S. estimates place
his armed strength at just under 10,000.
   Khun Sa was in an expansive, jocular mood, shouldering a
recoilless rifle for photographers and giving soldiers tips on
firing a 60mm mortar.
   Beneath the swagger were signs of anxiety. He admitted all was
not well in his domain.
   A day earlier, reinforcements from Tiger Camp had marched out to
face the Wa in a months-long conflict over an important smuggling
corridor to the Thai frontier.
   Wa tribesmen once fought the government under the Burma
Communist Party's banner, but now are muscling in on Khun Sa's
territory with government help. The new arrangement is typical of
the Triangle's shifting alliances and bloody rivalries.
   The Wa are not Khun Sa's only worry.
   Because of the U.S. indictment, there is pressure on the Thais
to cut links indispensable to him. Thailand is Khun Sa's major
source of supplies and weapons, and aides say he has built a
network of relationships with Thai businessmen, officials and
military officers.
   Khun Sa scoffs at America's ``showcase war'' on drugs, directed
by what he describes as incompetent DEA agents, but admits to
having tightened security. He travels in a pickup truck mounted
with a machine gun, accompanied by six bodyguards carrying
battlefield weaponry.
   ``If the Americans put me into custody, they will have to feed
me,'' he said. ``What's the use? The poppy cultivation will just go
on and on.''
   Analysts generally agree getting rid of Khun Sa would merely
leave a temporary vacuum that other warlords would fight to fill.
   They also agree with his assessment that the opium trade is
flourishing. The U.S. government estimates Burma's opium output
doubled to 2,600 tons from 1988 to 1989.
   Western officials say that mountain of narcotics is the core of
Khun Sa's organization, not the Shan nationalism he professes.

   They wait their turns in a special area.
   Some sit quietly, alone. A few stretch muscles or pace nervously
on the patch of artificial grass. Others chat boisterously with
friends who came to watch, have jumped already or plan to go later.
   All steal glances at the oversize rubber bands to which they
will entrust their lives. Will they prove thick enough when,
suddenly, there is nothing below the feet but shallow water and
your body plunges toward it?
   This is bungee jumping, the sport of pumping adrenalin, pounding
heart and an unlikely blend of cold fear and wild exhilaration.
   Cameras click and whir. Second thoughts skitter across a few
faces when two candidates decide, after looking down from a steel
cage suspended 140 feet in the air by a crane, that bungee jumping
is not a good idea after all. They forfeit their $69 ($55 U.S.).
   Black clouds roll in. A rainstorm suspends operations as gusty
winds buffet the cage, making it sway. Nerves tense and minutes
drag by. Then the skies begin to clear and, below, the yacht
pennants droop.
   Jumpers are weighed to determine which of several cords will be
used to stop the fall 6 to 8 feet above water.
   Ankles are strapped snugly into heavy fabric-and-Velcro
bracelets that are attached to each other, with a loop for the long
cord. The other end is hooked to the bottom of the cage.
   What bravado there was seems to continue until the jumper is put
into the cage with two crew members, secured with a seat belt, and
the crane begins lifting it.
   On the way up, the jumper is coached in what to do on the way
down, how to overcome fear and get the most from the jump. The
spiel also seems designed to give the mind a focus and keep terror
away.
   ``If you look down and start to get scared, look at the
horizon,'' one crew member suggests. ``Put your toes on the edge of
the cage, then on our signal, jump.''
   Sounds simple, but a glance at the water below dries the mouth
and churns the stomach. The height looks great enough from the
ground, but the concept of 140 feet changes drastically with the
new perspective.
   In parachuting, the ground is so far down as to seem unreal.
Here, it's easy to pick out details. The people look like ants; the
yachts moored nearby are unfriendly shoals.
   A crewman unstraps the seat belt and opens the gate. The cage
moves in the breeze. Before there's too much time to think, and
freeze, there's a count of ``Three . . . two . . . one . . .
BUNGEEEEEEEE!!''
   Suddenly, there is nothing below but shallow water and the body
hurtles downward. The adrenalin that had started the heart pounding
now pours in.
   The queasy stomach seems to be left up there, somewhere, and the
weightless sense of free fall sets in just before the cord
stretches, stretches . . . and then ends the dive.
   It contracts again, then relaxes, contracts, like a rubber band,
and the jumper gets a feel for manipulating the bounces, like a
yo-yo or someone on a reverse trampoline.
   By the time the cage, and the jumper, are lowered to the ground,
the initial fear has been replaced by disappointment that it is
over. A crew member grabs dangling hands and leads the body to a
soft landing on a padded platform.
   Some of the spectators applaud as the anklets are removed. The
jumper stands, a bit unsteadily, and turns his attention to sorting
out the sequence and feelings of the last few moments.
   Another jumper is strapped into the cage.
   The roots of bungee are in Pentecost Island, part of the Vanuatu
chain in the South Pacific. Every May, when the yams are ready to
be harvested, young males go through a manhood ritual by jumping
from a homemade tower with vines attached to their ankles.
   The lowest platform is 30 feet and the highest more than 120. As
men gain stature in the village, they move up to higher platforms.
   Inauguration of the high-tech version is credited to the
Dangerous Sports Club of Oxford University in Britain. Members
dressed in tuxedos, among them Graham Chapman of Monty Python, made
several jumps from bridges about a decade ago, including San
Francisco's Golden Gate.
   In 1987, New Zealander A.J. Hackett made headlines when he and a
friend hid on the Eiffel Tower overnight and plunged through the
open center from the second level, a height of about 360 feet.
   Hackett brought bungee jumping back to New Zealand and
commercialized it. Thousands of people take the plunge there each
year and, in January at Auckland, the Commonwealth Games featured a
demonstration.
   A few of the comparatively rich and famous have given it a try,
including boxer Jeff Harding, rugby star Wally Lewis and singer
Deborah Harry, who went topless.
   John Fahey, industrial relations minister of New South Wales
state, delayed the Sydney operation for three months because of
health concerns, then gave the go-ahead to what he called
``glue-sniffing for yuppies.''
   One fatality and a serious injury have been recorded in New
Zealand. France, where there were three deaths in 1989, recently
introduced regulations.

   New novels by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, John
Updike, Ann Rice and Stephen King should make for brisk sales this
fall, but publishers and booksellers worry a recession could turn
many buyers into browsers.
   The publishing boom of the past decade may be the problem. Net
sales in the United States jumped from $1.4 billion in 1982 to $3.4
billion in 1989 and some worry the industry has become too big for
its own good.
   ``In the past we were recession-proof,'' said David Schwartz, a
retailer for 31 years and president of the Harry W. Schwartz
Bookshop, which owns six stores in the Milwaukee area.
   ``But since our last recession in 1982 we've expanded our book
publishing beyond that core population. We have more than doubled
the buying public and we have a lot of new people whose commitment
to books is a lot more fragile.''
   ``The horrible truth is if you want to play in the sandbox you
might get sand thrown in your eyes,'' said Brigitte Weeks, editor
in chief of the Book of the Month Club. ``But the larger the
sandbox the better. There can't be any such thing as too big a book
industry.''
   ``I think I pretty much share the concerns about the economy,''
said Stephen Rubin, president and publisher of Doubleday Co.
``There's a general feeling we're in a recession, but there are
certain books I hope will be recession-proof.''
   Fiction looks strong this fall, with Alfred A. Knopf leading the
way. This is the publishing house's 75th anniversary and Marquez,
Updike, Rice and Geoffrey Wolff all have books coming out. New
writers Nicholas Shakespeare and Walter Kirn may also attract
favorable attention.
   ``I think we have five or six selections from Knopf on our
list,'' Weeks said. ``It's the most I've ever seen in the two years
I've been here. We usually have at most two or three by one
publishing house. We try to swing around.''
   ``The General in His Labyrinth'' is the latest novel by Marquez,
the Nobel Prize-winner whose previous works include the
best-selling ``Love in the Time of Cholera'' and the classic ``One
Hundred Years of Solitude.'' Based on the life of Latin American
revolutionary Simon Bolivar, ``The General in His Labyrinth'' is
being published this month.
   Harry ``Rabbit'' Angstrom was last seen cradling his grandchild
at the end of ``Rabbit Is Rich,'' Updike's Pulitzer Prize-winning
novel published 10 years ago. He was also operating a thriving car
dealership and had moved into a new home with his wife, Janice.
   Now, in ``Rabbit at Rest,'' Rabbit has heart trouble, a second
grandchild and a condo in Florida. This is the conclusion to
Updike's acclaimed ``Rabbit'' series, which began in 1960 with
``Rabbit, Run'' and was followed a decade later by ``Rabbit
Redux.'' The new book is due in October.
   Rice, author of the popular Vampire chronicles, a trilogy that
includes ``Interview With the Vampire,'' ``The Vampire Lestat'' and
``The Queen of the Damned,'' has a new book in November. Called the
``The Witching Hour,'' the book's story of a woman descended from
witches who saves a drowning man covers four centuries and runs 800
pages.
   ``Publishers like to present their best foot forward in the
fall,'' explained Barbara Morrow, co-owner of Vermont's Northshire
Bookstore.
   ``I think this year will be strong. I don't think it's unusually
strong, but it'll be a good fall. There are a number of strong
titles, the John Updike, the Jean Auel, Garcia Marquez.''
   Other major books include King's ``Four Past Midnight'' and T.
Coraghessan Boyle's ``East Is East,'' both published by Viking;
Larry McMurtry's ``Buffalo Girls,'' and fiction by Allende, J.M.
Coetzee, Muriel Spark and Nadine Gordimer. ``Plains of Passage,''
the fourth book of Auel's popular earth children series, will be
published by Crown in October.
   ``I think it'll be great,'' said Lou Haggerty, a buyer with the
Tattered Cover in Denver, which at 40,000 square feet is one of the
country's largest bookstores. ``I think there's something for
everyone ... but I didn't see anything that I thought was a
blockbuster.
   Among non-fiction books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. will be heavily
promoting Ronald Reagan's autobiography, ``An American Life,''
scheduled for a November release. Doubleday will cap the baseball
season with Bo Jackson's ``Bo Knows Bo,'' and Simon &amp; Schuster has
just issued ``Preston Sturges,'' the autobiography of the late
director.
   Civil War readers will have several books to consider:
   _ ``The Civil War: An Illustrated History,'' is a companion
volume to the nine-part PBS series scheduled for the end of this
month. Geoffrey C. Ward, whose biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt
won him the 1989 National Book Critics Circle Award, wrote the text
along with Ric Burns and Ken Burns. Five historians contributed
essays and the book contains more than 500 photographs.
   _ The Library of America is issuing memoirs by two Civil War
generals, Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman.
   _ ``Lincoln on Democracy'' is an anthology published by
HarperCollins of the president's speeches, writings and
conversations. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo contributed an
introduction and will help publicize it.
   Schwartz criticized the non-fiction list as ``very weak'' and
said it continues a trend of the past years.
   ``Serious nonfiction is expensive to do. You need long lead
times, and you have to support the author doing research,''
Schwartz said.
   ``Publishers are looking for a quick return and less expensive
commitment to the books. Major publishers ... are simply not
willing to put out the kinds of dollars it would take to do these
books.''
   Bill Shinker, senior vice president and publisher of the adult
trade division at HarperCollins, insisted the commitment to
non-fiction books was still strong.
   ``We're willing to make investments and allow writers the time
to do books,'' Shinker said. ``This fall we are publishing Ronald
Hayman's biography of Marcel Proust, and that took four years.
   ``We're also doing a complete revision of `Roget's Thesaurus,'
an investment the previous management didn't want to do. It will be
about four years in the making.''
   Bernard Rath, executive director of the American Booksellers
Association, dismissed criticism of current books as based on the
idea that in ``the good old days everything was better.'' More
publishing houses means writers have more places to go, Rath says,
and that means more opportunities for solid writing of all kinds.
   Weeks also defended the quality of the fall list and thinks
sales will be strong. She notes the publishing industry survived
the 1982 recession and will probably do fine this time. There's
always the chance of a slump, she says, but the publishing industry
may still be the safest part of the sandbox.
   ``I've developed the following comfortable scenario,'' Weeks
said. ``People come to the conclusion it's cheaper to stay at home
with a book. There's a certain reality with books that's not
associated with restaurants or movies or the theater. Books have a
different niche in the consciousness.''

<HEAD>Bill and Katherine Baker: Bringing the Middle East Crisis Home to
America</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to DELETE incorrect reference to Indian summer.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>

   After Katherine Baker finishes telling
the tale of her escape from the Middle East, an awkward silence
spreads across the gymnasium bleachers at Central Catholic High.
   ``Any questions? Come on, no one has any questions?'' Katherine
asks, looking out at the teen-age audience wilting in the late
summer heat.
   Katherine sees the kind of wide-open Midwestern faces she, her
brother and sister knew as students in this rural city about an
hour northwest of Indianapolis.
   She is trying to reach them with images of Kuwait's modern
downtown, its ancient gold souks, the Arabic people's warmth.
Telling these students about that foreign, faraway life is all she
can do now.
   Because that life, as if a mirage, is gone.
   Like her brother, Bill Baker, Katherine lost everything on Aug.
2, when Saddam Hussein's troops crossed from Iraq into Kuwait. She
awoke on that day to the sound of artillery. She since has slept
fitfully, if at all.
   For the Bakers, this international crisis is a personal crisis.
But more than the financial stability and treasured possessions
lost, they are mourning and fighting for what Kuwait was to them.
   ``She's making (the Middle East) real for the kids,'' said Steve
Eddy, a social studies teacher at Central Catholic. ``Some
Americans feel the hostages deserved to be victims. The kids have
asked what Americans were doing there anyway.''
   Katherine, 37, was a retail manager happily settled in a house
near the sea. After 3{ years in Kuwait, she finally had made a home
for her two wrinkle-faced pups, artwork, antiques and other
souvenirs collected over a decade living abroad.
   Bill, who was on vacation in France when Iraq invaded, was a
contractor and consultant in Kuwait. In the Middle East, he'd found
a place to start anew after divorcing his wife 11 years ago. He was
financially well-off, enjoying a Porsche and 42-foot sailboat. He'd
cultivated an international circle of friends and an understanding
of Arab culture.
   ``That country is a little gem,'' said Bill, 40, his ruddy and
animated face momentarily wooden. ``But it's gone. That life, my
loves, my boat ... my baby mug.''
   The Bakers have lost their touchstones. They now live nowhere
and own next to nothing: a pair of sneakers, some jeans, a few
photos, whatever Katherine stuffed into her hastily packed bag.
   Suddenly, these independent world travelers have come home to
bunk with their middle sister, Sarah, or maybe with their widowed
mother in Springfield, Ill.
   Young Americans have never known war and, studies indicate,
would likely have trouble finding Kuwait, which is one fifth the
size of Indiana, on a map. And yet, since summer's calm was
shattered, they have heard daily reports on Americans held hostage
and soldiers deployed in the Middle East.
   ``Be aware ... know the world and that it is very small today,''
Katherine urges the kids at her alma mater. ``I wouldn't be here if
it weren't for my Kuwaiti friends.''
   The first student tentatively raises a hand, then more follow
with questions. They want to know: Was Kuwait a democracy or a
dictatorship? What exactly are American troops over there to
protect? Would she live there again?
   Katherine is grabbing their attention with a real story about
how accepting people with a different religion, looks or culture
saved her life.
   She is talking both about the European friends with whom she
toughed out the siege's first days and about the natives who helped
her to safety after 12 days in hiding.
   At great risk, a Kuwaiti family she'd never met before and may
never see again brought Katherine and her German boyfriend _
disguised in traditional black religious robes _ along in their
caravan across the desert.
   Iraqi troops twice turned the four-jeep convoy back at the
city's outskirts before the group navigated a route out under the
desert's 120-degree sun. Her Kuwaiti allies never flinched.
   The group stopped only briefly during their four-hour dash.
Once, to pick up a disoriented and dehydrated Arab whose car had
broken down hours earlier. The second time to free a jeep stuck in
the sand.
   ``I saw a lot of abandoned cars. A lot. And that's sad,''
Katherine said. ``I know a lot of my friends, their families, have
died.''
   Katherine crouched in the jeep's rear, wedged between gas cans
and her trembling dogs.
   ``Two weeks before, things were fine, I was living a normal
life,'' Katherine said. ``Then all of a sudden you're running
through the desert with a dog hugging you.''
   When Katherine finally reached the Saudi border, she was not
elated. Too many people had been left behind, along with the baby
photos, letters and other possessions of a lifetime.
   ``I feel a great debt to those people,'' said Katherine, running
a hand through the hair she cropped short after friends reported
Iraqi troops were raping women. ``I owe them my freedom.''
   Bill, too, feels an allegiance. His friends, who helped
Katherine escape, now are penniless and frozen out of their
homeland. ``We've got to build back,'' he said. ``When the doors
open, we'll be ready.''
   Bill plans to organize a group of contractors, technicians,
computer specialists and others to go in and rebuild when Kuwait is
freed _ as he is sure, one day, it will be. Katherine plans to work
with the Coming Home Committee, a group based in Champaign, Ill.,
that is working to help hostages and their families.
   ``Brush it off, get on, keep busy,'' says Sarah, 38, a professor
of radiologic technology at Indiana University. Her Indianapolis
home is a refuge for Bill and Katherine, whose spirits are
bolstered by seeing Uncle Bob, eating corn on the cob, sailing and
other hallmarks of childhood summers.
   But the Bakers can't wipe their slates clean and begin fresh in
the United States. They have brought something of Kuwait back with
them and are sharing it with whomever is willing to listen.
   ``A whole country has been robbed and raped,'' Katherine said.
``But crying about it doesn't do anything but bring everyone's
morale down.''
   Added Bill: ``We just have to pick up the pieces. Start over
again.''

<HEAD>Junk Bonds Earn Nickname in August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond defaults, recession fears and explosives
piling up near some of the world's largest pools of oil helped junk
bonds earn their nickname last month.
   August was one of the worst months on record for the risky
bonds, according to indexes compiled by analysts who watch the
market.
   Salomon Brothers Inc.'s High-Yield Market Index had a total
negative return of 3.87 percent in August, and Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co.'s high-yield index posted a total negative return of 3.83
percent.
   ``The stars were aligned just right last month,'' said Joseph C.
Bencivenga, director of high-yield research at Salomon.
   High-yield bond issuers were defaulting at an annual rate of 5.8
percent in the first half of the year, the highest in 20 years,
according to Moody's Investors Service Inc. Also, many economists
believe the economy is headed for a recession or already in one,
which could accelerate defaults.
   Threat of war in the Middle East and higher oil prices has
pushed down bond and stock markets since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug.
2. Investors fear higher inflation that could result from the sharp
increase in oil prices.
   If there's any good news in the junk-bond market's poor
performance, it's that the market performed as expected in light of
world events, said Martin Fridson, head of high-yield research at
Merrill Lynch.
   ``In a general way, it should mirror the trends in other
markets,'' he said.
   The 30-issue Dow Jones industrial average, for example, fell 10
percent in the month and the broader Standard &amp; Poors 500 Index was
off 9 percent in August, its worst month since October 1987.
   As a result of the slumping junk market, new issues have slowed
to a trickle.
   ``Given the lackluster tone in the market today, the investors
have taken a wait-and-see attitude,'' Bencivenga said.
   Last week, Stone Container Corp., a Chicago-based paper and
packaging company, canceled plans to peddle $200 million worth of
new junk bonds on a tour around the country. Arnold Brookstone,
chief financial officer at Stone Container, said the issue was
postponed until the market improves.
   The derth of investors willing to put their money into the junk
market has forced issuers to offer higher yields. For some, the
yields are apparently too burdensome to warrant selling the notes.
   The shortage of new issues has also spilled over into the more
secure investment-grade market. Bondweek, a trade publication, last
week reported that three frequent debt issuers with strong credit
ratings wanted to sell three-year notes at around 9 percent in the
last week in August.
   Investment bankers, however, warned them away from the market,
the newsletter said, quoting unidentified syndicate and corporate
officials.
   Without any major developments in the Middle East, the next bit
of news that could have a profound impact on the junk-bond market
is the Commerce Deparment's release this Friday of retail sales
figures.
   ``It should be flat. If it comes in above or below that, (the
price of) high-yields could jump up dramatically or see further
deterioration,'' Bencivenga said.

<TEXT>
   What a difference a year makes for investors in
airline stocks.
   As summer 1989 drew to a close, shares of leading airline
companies were soaring along at record highs, and the industry was
brimming with takeover plans and rumors.
   Today, many of these same stocks are virtually grounded, beset
by recession worries and the surge in oil prices.
   Over the 12 months through the end of August, the Dow Jones
index of airline stocks suffered a decline of 54.49 percent,
ranking 79th in a field of 82 groups.
   During that span the air carriers barely edged their beleagured
cohorts in the homebuilding, hotel and Eastern banking businesses
to stay out of last place in the stock-market performance derby.
   Consider UAL Corp., which traded as high as $294 last year as a
group mapped plans for a $300-a-share buyout of the company. Last
week, the stock hovered around $92.
   AMR, parent of American Airlines, has tumbled over roughly the
same span from $107 to $45, and USAir from just under $55 to around
$17.
   At Delta Air Lines, the ride was not quite so bumpy, with the
stock down ``only'' about 35 percent, from $85 to $55 or so.
   The airline group has been directly in the line of fire of just
about every unsettling development that has hit the stock market
over the past year _ from the collapse of the takeover boom to the
showdown in the Middle East.
   The first blow came Oct. 13 of last year, when a group putting
together a planned acquisition of UAL disclosed that it was having
trouble lining up financing for the bid.
   That set off a shock to investors' confidence that drove the Dow
Jones industrial average down 190 points in what was billed as a
``mini-crash.''
   Efforts persist to devise a new buyout plan involving United
Airlines employees, management and outside investors.
   Even before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 of this year, airline
stocks suffered further damage as oil prices crept upward and talk
of a recession spread. Then, when the crisis hit in the Persian
Gulf and the oil market skyrocketed, the industry's fortunes took
another abrupt drop.
   ``The same factor that has created a panic in the broad market
is working overtime on the transports, and it's easy to see why,''
says Stephen Leeb in his investment advisory letter Indicator
Digest.
   ``Transportation companies are among the nation's largest
consumers of oil. So higher oil prices escalate operating costs,
reducing margins. And higher airline rates reduce overall passenger
travel.''
   Paul Nisbet, an analyst who follows the group for
Prudential-Bache Securities, put out a ``sell'' recommendation
after the Iraqi invasion.
   ``We expect the jump in jet-fuel prices and slowing traffic due
to a sluggish economy to cut earnings for the major airlines
dramatically,'' he said in a subsequent report.
   With all the negatives weighing on the industry, however, some
analysts say the time may soon be ripe to look for bargains among
these depressed stocks.
   Given expectations earlier this year of higher oil prices, Leeb
said, ``we've been bearish on the transports, but enough is enough.
   ``As long as America is in business, there will be a need for
transportation. In fact, as the world continues to become more
integrated economically, the need for transports will increase.
   ``There's a risk that higher oil prices will further torpedo
earnings in the short term. But with the recent selloff, that's
already reflected in these stocks' prices.''

   How to make something worth nothing worth
something?
   The Soviet Union is trying to turn its practically worthless
ruble into an internationally accepted currency, and the task is
putting the world's leading economists to the test.
   So far, the verdict is that making something of value of the
bills that carry the hammer and sickle won't be easy. But it's an
essential step on the Soviet road toward the modern economic world.
   Rubles are worth nothing outside the Soviet Union because the
government has refuses to back them with hard currency, gold or
silver. Tourists are allowed to take only a few rubles into or out
of the country, and even that was prohibited until recently.
   This has insulated the ruble from the ups and downs of world
money markets, but has reduced Moscow to conducting much of its
foreign trade as barter _ trading Stolichnaya vodka for Pepsi-Cola,
for instance. The government sells its precious natural resources
to earn foreign currency.
   As Soviet economists debate how to establish a market-driven
economy, they are increasingly aware of the need for a convertible
currency.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, president of
the Russian republic, have proposed separate plans for quick change
to a market economy.
   Transforming the ruble will be complex.
   To begin with, a ruble's comparative worth is unclear. The
government maintains two official exchange rates that allow
foreigners to buy a ruble for either $1.59 or 16 cents, depending
on the nature of the transaction.
   The second rate, available only to tourists, is widely regarded
as more accurately reflecting the ruble's real value, said Ed
Hewett, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
   Making the ruble freely convertible would allow the world market
to determine its worth, but that could bring substantial pain to
Soviet consumers, said Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University
economist who has been an architect of Poland's ``shock therapy''
economic reforms.
   Soviet citizens have an extraordinarily high savings rate
because there is little for them to buy and subsidized prices of
many staple goods are artificially low.
   According to Sachs, if the ruble became convertible overnight,
people would have a large amount of money to spend on Western goods
_ the classic ``money chasing goods'' form of inflation.
   That could create inflation so severe that the government might
fall, said Josef Brada of Arizona State University.
   Sachs suggested the danger of inflation could be lessened by
having the government simultaneously double prices and wages,
effectively reducing the potential strength of savings.
   Raising prices is the least popular element of proposed economic
reforms, however, and plans for a gradual change to convertibility
have been put forward.
   Brada led a panel of experts that proposed a five-step plan last
year. In the first phase, some hard currency would be made
available at auction for state enterprises to buy with rubles.
   The auction would gradually be broadened to include
cooperatives, private enterprise and joint ventures. After that,
households would be allowed to own foreign currencies and
foreigners would be given the right to exchange their currencies
for rubles at a rate determined by the market.
   In August, the government said some businesses would be allowed
to trade rubles for hard currency at a market rate beginning next
year, as a step toward making the ruble convertible.
   Brada said his step-by-step approach would protect consumers
from the first volatile days of convertibility and act as a
``whip'' to drive industry.
   He said Soviet industries that produce the best products, and
would have the best chance in world markets, are probably the
richest in rubles and in the best position to buy large amounts of
hard currency.
   They could use the hard currency for successful foreign
ventures, and inefficient factories without the rubles to buy hard
currency would fall aside.
   ``If convertibility accomplishes anything, it reallocates
resources from inefficient to efficient'' industries, Brada said.
   Proposals with many of the same concepts, but in different
sequences, were among the winners of a suggestion contest sponsored
by an American philanthropist this year. In those proposals,
creation of an efficient, market-oriented economy is seen as a
necessary precursor of convertibility.
   Hewett, one of the contest judges, said the Soviet Union must be
able to offer ``a range of products that is broad and deep enough''
to compete on the world market before the ruble becomes fully
convertible.
   Otherwise, he said, rubles would be spent on foreign goods and
the Soviet Union would have no way of earning hard currency.
   To that, Brada added that having a healthy manufacturing base is
better support for a currency than gold reserves.
   ``Gold is readily indentifiable . . . but the value (of a
currency) in international terms is the country's ability to
export,'' he said.
   After determining how to make the ruble convertible, the Soviet
government would have to consider the extent to which it was
prepared to intervene in the exchange market, buying rubles with
gold or foreign currencies to support the ruble if its price
started to fall.
   ``My suspicion is that the Soviets would do a lot of
intervention,'' Brada said. ``Psychologically, they have a strong
preference for stability.''
   In the initial stages, convertibility will be just a ``look at
what the ruble can do in various activities,'' Brada said.
   If it can't do much, winners of the convertibility competition
won't have to worry. The prize money was in dollars, 42,000 of them.

<HEAD>A Sigh of Relief, Economic Disappointment, and New Computers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is it an economic crisis yet, or still just
political?
   That was the question on business minds as the Persian Gulf
standoff dragged through its fifth week.
   The financial markets, hit hard when Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2,
have tried to reach an uneasy peace with the Mideast situation. But
oil prices resumed their climb during the past week, causing
periodic retreats in the stock market.
   While panic has largely subsided, the threat of calamity
remains. A crisis resolved peacefully would have mostly political
consequences. A war might spell economic disaster.
   Experts likened the market's current conundrum to the strain of
past war scares. A headline in Forbes magazine's Sept. 17 edition
screamed, ``Remember the Maine!'' _ in reference to the market's
performance after saboteurs blew up a U.S. battleship in Havana
harbor in February 1898.
   The market lost about 16 percent of its value within a month of
that incident, but then rebounded strongly in a so-called
``sigh-of-relief'' rally.
   Some would argue the markets have already heaved their sigh this
time _ about two weeks ago _ and are getting jittery all over again.
   That's the other lesson of history, observers pointed out. Even
after shaking off political fears, the markets may be hit by a
second wave of worries over the longer term economic impact of a
crisis.

<HEAD>ECONOMY: What the Signs Are Saying</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   If the economic crisis theory holds, the markets may be in for
even tougher sledding.
   The signals dispatched from the economic front during the week
were mostly discouraging: Unemployment rose from 5.5 percent in
July to 5.6 percent last month. Retail store sales, auto sales and
manufacturing were all sluggish in August.
   Among the reports, the manufacturing outlook may have been the
most disappointing. The National Association of Purchasing
Management said its index of business activity fell to 47.0 percent
from 47.4 percent in July. A reading below 50 percent is bad news
for the economy.
   The unemployment report, which came at week's end, added insult
to injury. Some observers said the worst part wasn't the increase
in the jobless rate _ that was expected. More depressing was the
idea that the increase might not be bad enough to prompt an
emergency rescue of the economy by the Federal Reserve.
   In the shadow of rising oil prices and inflation, the job
picture didn't appear to warrant a quick move by the Fed to loosen
credit.
   Contributing to the uncertainty, a Bush administration official
predicted oil supplies could get tight this fall as a result of the
Gulf confrontation.
   ``The last half of the fourth quarter gives us concern,''
Assistant Energy Secretary John J. Easton Jr. told a congressional
committee.

<HEAD>BANKS: The Biggest Are the Sickest</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Among the sickest sectors of the economy is banking, reports
confirmed.
   Moody's Investors Service, in a status report on the industry,
said troubled loans for real estate and leveraged buyouts have
added substantially to the burdens of the nation's biggest banks.
Once upon a time, all they had to worry about were bad loans to
developing nations.
   The exposed giants include BankAmerica Corp., Bankers Trust New
York Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Chemical Banking Corp.,
Citicorp, Continental Bank Corp., First Chicago Corp.,
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.
   The report said all the money centers except J.P. Morgan and
Bankers Trust were undercapitalized.
   A government report on bank profits confirmed the pessimistic
reading. Commercial banks earned $5.3 billion in the second quarter
of the year, down 24 percent from the same period in 1989,
according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The pinch was
worst in the Northeast.
   Other big players seemed to be just as frustrated. An
international credit agency said major Japanese banks faced ratings
downgrades as a result of the tumble in the Tokyo stock market.
   IBCA Ltd. of London predicted life for Japanese banks ``is going
to be more difficult from here on.''

<HEAD>COMPANIES: New Computers and a New Nordstrom</HEAD>

   Companies made news with assorted unveilings.
   Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan beat IBM Corp. to the punch in a duel to
promote new mainframe computers. Fujitsu announced a new line on
Tuesday, followed by International Business Machines Corp. on
Wednesday.
   Nordstrom Inc., the West Coast retailer known for superhuman
service, splashed into the Northeast market with a store in a
Paramus, N.J., mall. The entrance of such a formidable competitor
was no good news to stores struggling to woo ever more reluctant
shoppers. But Macy's, a neighbor at the Paramus center, made the
best of it, welcoming Nordstrom in a full-page newspaper ad that
gave Macy's credit for spurring the rival's move East.
   J.C. Penney Co., meanwhile, was pulling a line of boys clothes
off its shelves in response to hunters' complaints about the
not-so-subtle anti-hunting messages affixed to the garments. One
set of instructions appearing on shirts advised, ``Absolutely No
Hunting of Wild and Free Animals While Wearing This Garment.''
Penney apologized for the misguided promotion.
   Elsewhere, Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca said he had
ordered his managers to excise another billion dollars in costs by
the middle of next year. The cuts must come on top of $1.5 billion
previously prescribed.
   The savings and loan saga produced another strange tale with
courts removing, then reinstating federal regulators at Franklin
Savings Association in Kansas. The first court ruled the government
had acted rashly in taking control of the ailing thrift. A quick
appeal won the government a temporary reprieve.

   The sale seemed to dispel the notion that the Japanese hunger

worries.
   Back East, there was talk of Japanese interest in another sports

<HEAD>OPEC Marks 30th Anniversary - But With Little to Celebrate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In just a few days, OPEC marks its 30th
anniversary. But, with one of its founding members occupying
another, there is little to celebrate.
   ``It's a birthday, but not a happy birthday,'' said Peter Bogin,
associate director for oil markets at Cambridge Energy Research
Associates in Paris.
   ``They can celebrate their survival _ that's all they can
celebrate,'' said Pierre Terzian, editor of the Paris-based
newsletter Petrostrategies.
   The Sept. 14 anniversary of the founding of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries will pass with little fanfare. No
ceremony is planned at its headquarters in Vienna. Some countries
may issue commemorative stamps, hold news conferences or otherwise
mark the day.
   But, as it enters its fourth decade, OPEC is in crisis.
   A little more than a month ago, Iraq invaded and occupied its
tiny neighbor, Kuwait, in a dispute over oil wealth. The United
States launched a massive military buildup in Saudi Arabia, another
OPEC member, also in the oil-rich Persian Gulf. An international
embargo was slapped on Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude, pulling 4 million
barrels of oil a day off the market.
   With tensions running high, OPEC appears to have given up
exerting control over its members. A majority of nations recently
agreed to throw out temporarily the cartel's output quotas to allow
as much pumping as possible. They intend to make up most of the
shortfall of banned Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
   ``What we have done is put OPEC to sleep until the crisis is
over,'' said Sheikh Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the finance minister for
Kuwait's government-in-exile and its former oil chief.
   Terzian argued that by suspending its quota system, the cartel
``has abdicated its role of market leadership'' to Western nations.
   ``It is no exaggeration that the price of oil in the coming
months will be mainly determined by what the Americans want,'' he
said.
   In recent years, the organization had worked hard to adopt an
attitude of cooperation, not confrontation, with Western countries
that are the key consumers of its product. Demand for OPEC's oil
grew, supplies were abundant, and prices were generally good.
   But with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's lightning strike
against his neighbor, years of hard work vanished.
   ``OPEC's reputation has been badly tarnished,'' said Bogin.
   The West's impression is that the cartel's oil is in the ``the
hands of very belligerent, unstable countries,'' he said.
   The outcome of the crisis will determine the cartel's future _
and Iraq's power to dominate the group and push for higher pricing
policies.
   If Saddam's annexation of his neighbor holds, Iraq will gain
additional oil reserves and eliminate OPEC's main ``dove'' _ Kuwait
_ which had fought for lower prices.
   Western countries, fearful of Iraq's muscle, might rush to find
other fuels to replace oil in running their economies.
   But Saudi Arabia and others could refuse to accept the
annexation of Kuwait, creating a permanent split in OPEC. Iraq and
Libya stayed away from the cartel's latest meeting.
   If, on the other hand, Iraq's power is weakened, Saudi Arabia
and others will emerge in a stronger position and likely pursue
more moderate pricing policies in the future, analysts said.
   Despite the critical situation, few are ready to predict the
cartel's imminent demise.
   ``OPEC member countries ... are slaves to oil and therefore they
need OPEC,'' said Terzian.
   He was referring to the heavy dependence of the group's members
on crude exports to get badly needed money for their economies,
some of which have rung up heavy debts with Western nations.
   ``It's not the end of OPEC by any means,'' said John Lichtblau,
chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York.
   ``OPEC has been a fairly important organization in influencing
world oil prices. It will continue to play a role in the 1990s,''
he said.
   With little publicity 30 years ago, five key oil-producing
nations _ Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iran, Iraq and Kuwait _ banded
together in Baghdad, Iraq, and set up a group to fight for higher
prices.
   Qatar, Indonesia and Libya joined soon after. The ranks were
filled out by the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Nigeria, Ecuador
and finally Gabon. Altogether, the countries hold about
three-quarters of the world's oil reserves and pump about one-third
of its oil.
   In its early years, the cartel attracted little attention _ some
say only ridicule _ from the major oil companies, which controlled
crude prices then.
   It wasn't until the 1970s that consumers took notice.
   An Arab embargo on crude supplies to the United States for
helping Israel in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war sent oil _ and gasoline
_ prices skyward.
   Crude prices again surged _ approaching $40 a barrel _ when oil
production from Iran fell after the 1979 revolution. The price
shock sent the world economy into a tailspin.
   ``In the 1970s and 1980s, (OPEC) kept prices higher than they
would have been (otherwise),'' said Lichtblau.
   OPEC's main function, he said, has been to regulate its members'
production so there is not too much oil on the market for the
demand of the United States and other consuming nations.
   ``OPEC is irrelevant while there is a world oil shortage,'' he
said. ``It is designed to keep members from overproducing and
driving prices down.''
   But its regulating mechanism hasn't always worked.
   Earlier this year, crude prices plunged mostly because of
overproduction by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, which
persistently ignored their OPEC supply quotas and flooded the
market with crude.
   The fall in prices touched off Saddam's wrath. He complained his
country had lost $14 billion in oil revenues over the past year
because of low prices. And he threatened to use force against
countries ignoring their OPEC quotas.
   A few weeks later, his troops rolled into Kuwait.

   The Soviets plan to pull out of the uranium operations located

<HEAD>No Break in Recession Clouds Over Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the debate keeps raging over whether the
United States faces a recession or not, many Wall Street investors
are resigning themselves to a long wait for a clear-cut answer.
   Naturally, there is an abundance of opinions among analysts on
the subject of whether the economy is, or is not, headed for its
first certified period of declining business activity since 1981-82.
   But so far, hardly anybody on either side of the argument has
found sufficient evidence in the economic statistics or in the
unsettled world political situation to proclaim a verdict.
   Many analysts see no reason to expect that stalemate to be
broken any time soon, given such imponderables as the eventual
outcome of the crisis in the Persian Gulf. And that uncertainty
looms as a particular problem for the stock and bond markets.
   ``There are no two ways about it _ investment decisions will
continue to be made in an environment of great unease about the
Middle East,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko
Securities International in New York.
   In theory at least, the unsettled stock market would get a big
boost if the chances seemed to increase that a recession could be
avoided and prospects for corporate profits could somehow brighten.
   Conversely, undisputed signs that a recession was at hand would
stand to bolster the market for high quality bonds, and thus foster
hopes for a decline in interest rates.
   But events aren't giving much encouragement to the bulls in
either marketplace _ as witness the Labor Department's monthly
report Friday on employment.
   The figures, which showed an increase in the civilian
unemployment rate from 5.5 percent in July to 5.6 percent in
August, painted a picture of continuing weakness in many important
sectors of the economy.
   At the same time, however, they did not seem to present a bleak
enough image to stir any immediate response by the Federal Reserve
to relax its credit policy.
   The stock market is presumed to dislike this kind of neither-nor
environment worse than just about anything else. Indeed, some say,
the outlook for stocks might actually start to improve once the
existence of a recession were confirmed.
   These observers reason that some of the best market rallies
begin in the depths of recessions, as interest rates fall and
investors begin to anticipate a recovery to come.
   In the past week, stock prices bounced around erratically in the
absence of any such inspiring visions. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials closed Friday at 2,619.55, up 5.19 from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.45 to 177.51;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market slipped
.83 to 380.38, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up .38 at 323.77.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 115.74 million shares a day,
against 127.88 million the week before.
   James Stack, publisher of an investment advisory service called
InvesTech, says stocks face a volatile environment over the next
year fraught with both danger and opportunity.
   Past experience shows, he adds, that ``it's only after the smoke
clears, and final economic statistics are compiled, that it becomes
apparent we were already in a recession long before it became
`headline material.'
   ``Not one of the past four recessions was forecast in advance by
a poll or group of economists.''

<HEAD>Asbestos Fund To Get More Money in Financial Restructuring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manville Corp. has agreed to inject up to $520
million over seven years into an asbestos trust fund to reverse a
cash shortfall jeopardizing compensation payments to tens of
thousands of victims.
   The agreement is the first step toward meeting more than 130,000
pending and untolled future claims by people who contracted lung
cancer and other respiratory ailments inhaling fibers from
Manville-made asbestos.
   The cash infusion, which would not begin until late 1991 at the
earliest, is part of an overhaul ordered by a federal judge after
the trust ran out of cash and said it would not meet new claims
until well into the 21st century.
   Asbestos is a mineral that can cause cancer when its fibers are
inhaled. Compensating asbestos disease victims and their families
is the biggest product liability issue in U.S. history, with cases
clogging courts nationwide. Many victims have died before receiving
payment.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein, who ordered the Manville
trust restructuring, in August froze all payouts except in
emergency health cases. Attorneys involved in the negotiations said
they expected some form of a payment freeze to remain until the
trust receives the new Manville money.
   That would delay even longer payments to many victims or their
families, some of whom have waited more than a decade for
compensation from Denver-based Manville and other asbestos
manufacturers.
   The Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust was created as
part of Manville's 1988 bankruptcy court reorganization. The trust
faces a $30 million deficit by March 31, 1991, and officials have
blamed the drain on more claims and bigger settlements than
expected.
   Attorneys said negotiations are continuing on a plan expected to
result in paying Manville trust claimants based on the severity of
illness and financial need rather than the date of filing. A group
of judges also is trying to fashion a nationwide solution to 90,000
pending lawsuits involving the trust and dozens of companies that
made asbestos.
   The new payments by Manville will be made as special
distributions to all common stockholders. Manville will turn the
trust's convertible stock into common stock, giving the trust about
80 percent of the company's 120 million outstanding common shares,
compared with about 50 percent today.
   The trust then would receive 80 percent of a maximum total of
$650 million in special distributions to be made over the next
seven years, or $520 million.
   The first $100 million payment would be made on Dec. 1, 1991, or
after the final payment plan is approved by Weinstein, whichever is
later. Another $100 million would be pumped into the trust one year
later, with $40 million infusions in each of the following two
years.
   In the fourth through seventh years, the trust will receive an
annual distribution based on Manville's performance, up to a
maximum $240 million.
   But Manville cautioned that all payments after the initial $100
million would depend on the company's ability to secure financing
through bonds and other sources in the financial markets.
   Under the bankruptcy court reorganization, insurance payments
and company contributions made the trust initially worth about $3
billion. Manville still is required to make regular cash payments
into the trust and pay 20 percent of its profits annually starting
in 1992 as part of the original plan.
   Manville was not required to contribute to the trust overhaul
and is legally shielded from further liability for asbestos health
claims. But the company's future success also depends on putting
the asbestos issue behind it.
   The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1982
because it couldn't meet mounting asbestos claims.
   Manville Chief Executive Tom Stephens said the new agreement
``is a good balance between directing cash to all of our
shareholders and reinvestment in our businesses.''
   He said the extra payments were not expected to hurt the
performance of the company, which makes a variety of building and
engineering products, including fiberglass, industrial insulation
and paper and wood products.
   Manville stock rose 75 cents to $6.75 in afternoon trading
Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The trust to date has settled close to 24,000 claims for more
than $1 billion, but has paid out only about two-thirds of the
amount. Payments have averaged about $43,000 per claim, compared to
an initial estimate of $25,000.
   In addition, judges have been harshly critical that about
one-third of payments have gone to pay lawyers' fees. Weinstein
last month restricted contingency fees to plaintiffs lawyers to 20
percent of all hardship settlements.
   Asbestos, which has natural heat resistance and insulation
properties, was used widely for decades in shipbuilding and other
construction industries. Companies have been held liable on the
grounds they failed to warn workers about its potential hazards.

   Employees cheered when Ernie
Fleischer walked in the front door of Franklin Savings Association,
after winning it back from federal regulators in a bitter court
battle.
   Just six hours later, an appeals court forced him out again.
Regulators moved back in.
   And even Thursday's events won't be the end of the roller
coaster ride for the once-tiny Franklin, which boomed in the 1980s
on a complex investment strategy that the government now contends
it mishandled.
   ``I'm optimistic we'll win,'' Fleischer, the thrift's chairman
and the man credited with its growth, said Friday. ``It will just
take time.''
   Franklin was seized Feb. 16 of this year by regulators with the
Office of Thrift Supervision. Attorneys contended the thrift used
improper accounting tricks to avoid $119 million in losses from the
futures market.
   They ordered the bank to take the losses immediately, which
placed it below required capital requirements and triggered the
takeover. The Resolution Trust Corp. took control.
   Fleischer and other officers filed suit, saying regulators had
changed their accounting rules in midstream. After a four-week
trial, U.S. District Judge Dale E. Saffels ruled Wednesday that
regulators had acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.
   Fleischer and fellow managers regained control of Franklin on
Thursday morning. But six hours later, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Denver granted the government's request for a
temporary stay in the order until it can appeal.
   Regulators re-seized Franklin, and Fleischer walked out of the
suburban Kansas City branch office where he was visiting employees.
   ``He can't go back for now,'' Franklin's attorney, Roger
Stanton, said Friday. ``They had a nice day yesterday and got to
see some employees, but that's that. It was good for the employees
to see Ernie again.''
   On Friday, Fleischer, 57, was busy answering calls in the home
office he has used since Franklin was seized.
   Analysts say Franklin, which was founded in 1889 in the small
town of Ottawa, Kan., was different than other thrifts in its
operations. About 10 years ago it began to move beyond the
traditional S&amp;L business of simple home loans and passbook savings
accounts and sought out so-called brokered deposits, in which
depositors from anywhere in the nation ask brokers to seek out the
highest possible interest rates.
   It then used that money to buy mortgage-backed bonds, and
protected itself against resulting swings in interest rates by
buying and selling futures contracts.
   ``Franklin operated in an entirely different way than just about
any thrift I know,'' said Henry Peltz, an analyst with Keefe,
Bruyette and Woods in New York. ``They were not a lending
institution, they were an investing institution. And Ernie
Fleischer taught Wall Street a good deal about hedging.''
   Franklin's $11.4 billion in assets made it the 21st largest
savings and loan in the nation a year ago and the largest in
Kansas. More than 90 percent of those assets were in
mortgage-backed securities.
   Fleischer, a Kansas City tax lawyer, had acquired Franklin in
1972 with other investors. Although Franklin kept its headquarters
in Ottawa, he and his investment team worked out of an office
building in this Kansas City suburb.
   RTC officials were back in those offices Friday.
   Fleischer said he had time to do just a cursory examination of
the thrift's books Thursday before the government's re-seizure, but
it appeared stable.
   He said RTC agents have sold some assets and the thrift appeared
to have lost between $400 and $500 million in deposits.
   Franklin also lost about 50 of its 350 employees. But Fleischer
said he's optimistic the thrift would prosper if he regains control.
   ``Everyone I talked to yesterday was prepared to go back to work
and build on what exists,'' Fleischer said. ``There remains a very
highly skilled and highly qualified group of employees.''

   American businessmen at this year's
Leipzig Fair see bright times ahead as East Germany converts to
capitalism, but Soviet traders found far gloomier prospects.
   ``Because the Berlin Wall went down, I thought the prospect of
selling our wooden homes would be better than before, and we've had
quite a lot of success,'' said Orrelle Trent, president of
Blueberry Hill Cedar Homes in California.
   But a few buildings away from where the Business Center USA
exhibition was housed, the mood was tense at the Soviet pavilion.
The introduction of the powerful West German mark throughout East
Germany following the economic merger of the countries July 1 has
made it hard for the Soviets to do business at the fair.
   ``There are far fewer exhibitions because we have to pay for
everything in hard currency,'' explained Vladimir Krol, a
representative of Elektrointorg, a state-run electronics trading
company.
   The Leipzig Fair is an ancient trade meeting that since World
War II has been the showcase for products and technology from the
Communist countries of the Soviet bloc.
   The fair, which traces its origins to 1175, developed in the
Middle Ages as a main crossroads for metal trading in central
Europe.
   Its low point was in World War II, when the site was destroyed
by Allied bombing and the fair was closed. But after the war, the
fair was revived into a major trading thoroughfare.
   The democratic revolution that reversed communism in Eastern
Europe and the unification of the two German states this year
tempted many Western businesses to try their hand at the event.
   ``It's part of our all-around strategy to move into Eastern
Europe. We came to Leipzig to demonstrate that we're serious,''
said Christian Foster, a senior representative of Bell Atlantic
Corp., a regional telephone company.
   Things are different for the Soviets, whose pavilion seemed
strikingly out of place amid showy outdoor exhibitions from
Mercedes-Benz and Shell Oil Co. A huge bust of Lenin stands sternly
outside the massive concrete showroom, which is topped with a red
star.
   Krol said the biggest interest in his exhibit was for model
Soviet cars and bronze miniatures of pedigreed dogs that his
company also markets.
   Plastic lamps, oversized televisions and primitive video games
elicited little enthusiasm among fair-goers.
   East German products were very few. Those exhibited drew giggles.
   ``Can you imagine driving that?'' muttered one West German man
as he looked at a pickup truck version of the Trabant, the car East
Germans are trading in for West German cars.
   The Business Center USA attracted 19 American companies, while
dozens more were scattered throughout the massive complex on the
edge of Leipzig. Among the companies represented were the financial
concern J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Inc. and consumer and industrial products
giant General Electric Co.
   Thousands of exhibitors were on hand from 55 countries.
Attendance figures weren't available.
   Roger Schulz, representing the Duracell battery company, an
American firm with German headquarters in Cologne, said his company
has been coming to the fair since the 1960s.
   ``Because we were here before, it has been easier for us to
penetrate the East German and Soviet-bloc markets since all the
changes last year,'' Schulz said. Since last fall, his company has
opened 800 sales points in East Germany and is still expanding, he
said.
   Bell Atlantic also has business in mind. It has signed a
marketing agreement with Robotron, East Germany's largest computer
manufacturer, and wants to set up a joint venture with part of the
former state monopoly, which is being broken up.
   ``We felt working with Robotron would give us access to the
whole East European Market, rather than starting from scratch
ourselves,'' Foster said.
   The company plans to work out a training program with Robotron
employees to help regenerate the economy of East Germany, he said.
