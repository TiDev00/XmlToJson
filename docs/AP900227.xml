   A Federal Express airplane crashed and burned
Tuesday evening in a residential area near Stapleton International
Airport, killing the pilot, officials said.
   There were no reports of injuries on the ground.
   The aircraft, which had been en route from Aspen to Denver, went
down several blocks from the southeast end of the airport. The
plane crashed into a back yard near an alley, and did not hit any
buildings.
   The pilot was the only person aboard the single-engine Cessna
208 Caravan, said airport spokesman Jack McGuire. A city
firefighter said the pilot was killed.
   At the time of the crash, the temperature was just below
freezing and the weather included a combination of sleet, rain and
snow grains, the National Weather Service said.
   Laura DeMorrow, who lives near the crash site, said she saw the
plane sputtering and spiraling slowly towards the ground.
   DeMorrow said she then saw a large fireball. ``I saw flames and
smoke,'' then ran inside to call police, she said.
   DeMorrow said it sounded like the plane was stalling as it
plunged to the ground.
   Police erected barricades, and put up yellow rope to keep back
hundreds of curious spectators.
   Federal Express spokesman Armand Schneider said the plane had
been flying from Aspen to Denver, and was operated under lease by
PM Air of Phoenix.
   A Federal Express single-engine plane operated under lease by PM
Air crashed Jan. 17 into a mountain while flying packages from
Denver to Montrose, killing the pilot.

<HEAD>Northrop Pleads Guilty to Falsifying Tests on Harrier Jet, Missile
Parts</HEAD>

   Northrop Corp. pleaded guilty Tuesday to
nearly three dozen federal counts related to falsified testing of
parts for the AV-8B Harrier jet and cruise missile components, and
agreed to a $17 million fine.
   In a plea bargain, the defense contractor entered guilty pleas
through attorney Richard Sauber to 34 counts of making false
statements to the government.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William Fahey called the resolution of
the case ``a very significant victory in our efforts to combat
defense contractor fraud and mismanagement.''
   Prosecutors said charges would be dropped against Joseph Yamron,
62, vice president and general manager of Northrop's Norwood,
Mass.-based Precision Products Division, and Leopold Engler, 60,
vice president of instrument operations there.
   Earlier in the day, Charles Gonsalves, a former Northrop Corp.
plant manager, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to charges of
falsifying test data on components of cruise missile guidance
systems.
   ``The U.S. government and Northrop Corp. reached a complex
compromise today under which the government agreed to withdraw
various charges the company had been contesting for over a year,
and Northrop in turn agreed to pay a $17 million dollar fine for
charges arising out of actions by some employees it subsequently
fired in 1987 from its now closed Western Services Department,''
Northrop said in a statement issued from its headquarters.
   Northrop asserted that, according to the military services that
use the Harrier and the cruise missile, ``both systems have
performed satisfactorily in flight operations.''
   Regarding the Western Services Department and Precision Products
Division, the company said the government dropped 139 counts of
making false statements and two counts of conspiracy, and Northrop
agreed to plead guilty to 34 false statements that had been made by
the former employees at the department.
   Gonsalves entered the plea under an agreement with prosecutors
under which he would be sentenced to no more than three years in
prison and be fined a maximum of $1.2 million.
   Gonsalves, once supervisor of the Western Services Department,
pleaded guilty to one conspiracy count and seven counts of making
false statements to the government from 1984 to 1987.
   Sentencing was set for May 1 before Judge Pamela Ann Rymer.
   Northrop Corp. and five current and former employees were
indicted April 11, 1989, on charges of conspiring to defraud the
government through the cruise missile and the Navy's AV-8B Harrier
jump jet program.
   Gonsalves entered his plea pertaining to the cruise missile
systems as a jury was about to hear the case against him, quality
assurance supervisor Cheryl Hannan and Northrop on charges related
to the Harrier parts.
   Prosecutors agreed to a diversion program for Hannan, who was
charged in both the Harrier and missile aspects of the case, and
charges will be dropped if she completes the program to the
satisfaction of probation officials.
   Howard Hyde, chief engineer at Western Services, pleaded guilty
last May to charges involving falsifying tests on the jet parts.
   The 167-count indictment charged that the company and five
others conspired between the 1970s and 1989 to install parts for
the cruise missile's flight data transmitter that failed to meet
government specifications.
   It also said the transmitter required extensive reliability
testing that was not performed. Instead, the indictment said, three
of the defendants supervised false testing and falsification of
test results.
   Concerning the Harrier jet program, the indictment accused the
defendants of failing between 1981 and 1986 to conduct vibration
tests of the jet's rate sensor assemblies at levels required by
contract. The assemblies are part of the flight stabilization
system of the attack jet.
   Yamron and Engler, who have been on administrative leave to
prepare their defense, will return to their former duties, Northrop
said.
   ``From the time last April when the government filed its charges
against the division, Mr. Yamron and Mr. Engler, Northrop has
stated the charges were unwarranted and strongly disputed any
allegations of criminal behaviour by the Precision Products
Division or by those individuals,'' Northrop said.

<HEAD>Lawyer: No Settlement in AIDS Doctor Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for a physician who contends she
contracted AIDS from a contaminated needle said Monday there would
be no settlement with the city hospital agency and her negligence
lawsuit would go to the jury.
   ``We are committed to get this case through to a verdict as
quickly as possible so that Veronica Prego can go on with whatever
remains of her life,'' one of Prego's lawyers, Diane S. Wilner,
said outside the courtroom.
   The end of the two-month-long trial had appeared to be at hand
on Friday as testimony was interrupted for several hours while the
opposing sides conferred in the chambers of Justice Aaron D.
Bernstein of Brooklyn state Supreme Court.
   However, the negotiations collapsed and Prego's lawyers said the
jury would decide the lawsuit's outcome.
   The trial was postponed Monday because a juror became ill over
the weekend. Testimony was scheduled to resume Tuesday.
   Prego, 32, contends she developed the fatal disease after she
accidently pricked her finger on a needle that had been used to
draw blood from an AIDS patient at Kings County Hospital on the
night of Jan. 12, 1983.
   Prego is suing the city Health and Hospitals Corp. and two
physicians, charging negligence.

<HEAD>Fate of Millions May Hang on Ethiopian Port Battle</HEAD>

   The Ethiopian army and rebels are locked
in battle for a small, steamy Red Sea port that represents a door
of life for starving millions.
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia has called the
struggle for the port of Massawa a ``fight to the death'' to
prevent the collapse of one third of his army and the secession of
Eritrea province.
   But the outcome of the battle also may determine the fate of an
estimated 4 million people in northern Ethiopia in peril of
starving to death in the next few months.
   ``It's grim,'' said one Western relief worker. ``We're looking
at a catastrophe in the making.'' Crops have failed, emergency food
stocks are running low and the fighting has closed avenues for
relief supplies.
   The United Nations had hoped to ship most of 1.1 million tons of
donor food through Massawa to feed drought victims in Eritrea and
neighboring Tigre, Wollo and Gondor provinces.
   But with each day of fighting between government forces and the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front, that hope fades.
   The Eritrean rebels attacked Mengistu's 2nd Army along a
200-mile front on Feb. 8 in what the rebels described as a massive
assault.
   Within two days, the rebels claimed the capture of Massawa.
   Without specifically denying the claim, the government in Addis
Ababa said fighting for the port was continuing. The rebels later
accused the government of subjecting Massawa to attacks by heavy
artillery, bombs and napalm.
   The rebels contended as recently as last week that they still
controlled the port, but both sides have had little to say about
the fighting for more than a week.
   Since each side normally trumpets its victories, diplomats and
other observers in Addis Ababa take the absence of battlefield
reports to mean the battle for the port continues.
   On Feb. 17, in an unprecedented burst of candor, Mengistu said
his 2nd Army faced collapse and Eritrea would secede if the rebels
gained control of Massawa.
   ``We have no alternative but to fight to the death,'' Mengistu
told his armed forces in a radio and television broadcast.
   ``He is throwing everything he has into the battle,'' said an
African diplomat in a telephone interview from Addis Ababa. ``He is
reinforcing it (Eritrea) in every way possible,'' said another
envoy. The diplomats spoke on condition they not be identified.
   ``What we don't know is whether the port is going to be usable,
no matter whose hands it winds up in,'' said the Western relief
worker. ``It presumably has been badly damaged.''
   None of the diplomats or aid officials interviewed by telephone
from Nairobi would speak for attribution, saying they must deal
with Mengistu's government.
   Ethiopia has Africa's largest army, an estimated 315,000 men,
most of them ill-trained and poorly motivated peasant conscripts.
Between 120,000 and 130,000 are assigned to the 2nd Army, which has
borne the brunt of a 28-year-old secessionist war by the Eritrean
rebels.
   The International Institute for Strategic Studies in London puts
the strength of the Eritrean rebels at about 30,000, but they are
known to be well armed, mostly with captured weapons, and highly
disciplined.
   In the first few days of fighting for Massawa and the road that
connects it with the provincial capital of Asmara, the rebels claim
to have killed, captured or wounded 12,000 government soldiers and
seized 72 Soviet-made tanks, 22 artillery pieces and tons of small
arms. They also say they sank 12 Ethiopian navy craft in or near
the port.
   As ports go, Massawa isn't much _ a cluster of whitewashed stone
buildings, narrow streets and a population of 19,400.
   But it is one of only two ports on Ethiopia's Red Sea coast, has
two deep-water berths and, until the rebels began their offensive,
was the main northern gateway to mostly arid and mountainous
Eritrea.
   The country's only other port is at Assab, also in Eritrea near
its border with Djibouti. But it has no deep-water berths.
   Beyond Massawa, there are few alternative routes for emergency
food aid.
   Another rebel group, the Tigre People's Liberation Front, cut
the only highway from the capital north to Asmara a year ago. Some
food could be trucked in from neighboring Sudan, but few vehicles
are available, the roads are terrible and, at least for now, all
movements must be at night for fear of Ethiopian air attacks.
   This year's harvest failed in large parts of Eritrea and Tigre
provinces and, to a lesser extent, in Wollo and Gondor. What food
stocks remain from a year ago are rapidly running out.
   Some 25,000 refugees already have fled Tigre into Sudan and
United Nations and other aid officials expect their number to grow
as fighting halts food deliveries in northern Ethiopia.
   Those officials foresee a repeat of Ethiopia's great famine of
1984-85, in which as many as 1 million people may have died. Their
grim scenario has hundreds of thousands of desperate refugees
crowding into makeshift camps where, weakened by hunger and long
treks in search of food, more die of disease than from meager
rations.
   No end to the fighting is in sight.

   ``The Wonder Years'' and steamy ``Santa
Barbara'' are among the television shows headed for Polish
audiences under an agreement announced Monday between Polish TV
officials and an American outlet.
   The two-year agreement between Polish Television Channel 2 and
Annapolis-based Conduit Internationale Films calls for provision of
programming and selling of advertising for the station.
   Formerly one of Poland's two government-operated channels
offering a slim variety of news, current affairs and regional
programs, Channel 2 has been converted into a commercial operation
under Poland's new, non-communist government.
   In a statement released with the announcement, C.I. said it has
reached an agreement with the New World International production
company to provide ``The Wonder Years'' for Channel 2.
   Other New World features heading for Poland include the daytime
soap opera ``Santa Barbara'' and the crime-adventure show ``Wise
Guy.''
   Poland has a population estimated at 38 million and about 10
million households with televisions, according to C.I. The only
other Eastern European country with a commercial station is
Hungary, with a population of about 10 million.
   Conduit Internationale is a subsidiary of NL Technologies, which
has been involved over the past dozen years with several
non-entertainment businesses in Poland, including clothing
marketing and production and aircraft marketing.

   Singer Marian Anderson, whose concert before
Eleanor Roosevelt in 1939 was a landmark in the fight against
segregation, is asking black Americans to stand up and be counted
in the 1990 census.
   At a ceremony at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, the Census Bureau
on Monday unveiled a campaign to reach as many blacks as possible
after roughly 5 percent were missed in 1980.
   ``If they don't know now, they'll learn a little bit later that
it really pays to stand up and be counted,'' said Ms. Anderson, who
retired 25 years ago.
   On April 9, 1939, the 88-year-old Ms. Anderson sang in
Washington before an illustrious audience, including Mrs.
Roosevelt, at the Lincoln Memorial after she was barred from
appearing in Constitution Hall by the Daughters of the American
Revolution.
   The Census Bureau issued a poster Monday showing Ms. Anderson
performing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The poster urges
blacks to ``Lift Up Your Voice. Stand up for who you are. Answer
the census on April 1, 1990.''

   Grammy winners Mac Rebennack and Art, Aaron
and Charles Neville say the world is finally waking up to the New
Orleans sound.
   ``I don't think we're doing anything differently. I think the
world is just catching up to us,'' said Rebennack, better known as
Dr. John, at a city awards ceremony honoring the prize-winning
artists.
   Rebennack won a Grammy last week with Rickie Lee Jones for a
jazz duet version of ``Makin' Whoopee.''
   Art Neville of the Neville Brothers, winners for best pop
instrumental with the song ``Healing Chant,'' said national and
world recognition of New Orleans music, with its jazz, Caribbean
and African influences, was long overdue.
   Charles Neville said the awards were bound to help the city's
musicians.
   ``I think the big thing it did, though, was give more
credibility to New Orleans music,'' he said. ``We'll probably get
regular air play now. Before this, programmers said New Orleans
music was too regional. Well, it's true it is regional. But the
region is the world.''

   Ronald Reagan received an honorary degree
from Israel's largest institute of higher learning, Tel Aviv
University, one of several Jewish honors given the former president
so far this year.
   The presentation Sunday at a star-studded dinner at the Century
Plaza Hotel cited Reagan's ``steadfast friendship for the Jewish
people and vehement rejection of anti-Semitism.''
   In recent weeks, Reagan has been honored by the American Jewish
Committee and Hebrew University. In a few weeks, he will be feted
by the United Jewish Appeal Drive.
   Reagan joked to the appreciative black-tie audience that his
receipt of the honorary doctor of philosophy degree ``cannot be
based on any academic achievements.''
   He went on to explain that his alma mater, Eureka College in
Illinois, once gave him an honorary degree 25 years after his
graduation.
   ``That only aggravated a sense of guilt that I nursed for 25
years,'' Reagan said. ``I always suspected the first degree was
honorary.''

   Producer Saul Zaentz owes his ex-wife a
$300,000 share of the proceeds from the Oscar-winning movie
``Amadeus,'' a state appeals court ruled.
   The decision, released Monday, upheld a ruling by the judge at
the couple's divorce trial that Zaentz made $600,000 in unstated
income from the 1984 film, which won an Academy Award as best
picture.
   Half that amount belongs to his former wife, Lynda, under
California's community property law. The couple married in 1978 and
separated in 1983, a year in which Mrs. Zaentz worked as a
production assistant on ``Amadeus.''

than 250 lawsuits will be filed against Exxon in the months that
follow.
   March 30: Exxon fires tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood after
tests reveal he was legally drunk 10 hours after the accident.
   April 4: U.S. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan calls the spill
the oil industry's ``Three Mile Island.'' Oil now covers 1,000
square miles, leaking out of the sound to foul beaches along the
Gulf of Alaska and Cook Inlet.
   June 19: Exxon and other big oil companies announce plans for a
voluntary network of response teams capable of handling big spills
anywhere in U.S. coastal waters. Estimated cost: $250 million.
   Sept. 15: Exxon suspends its beach cleanup for the winter,
claiming it has left 1,100 miles of oiled beaches ``environmentally
stable'' and saying its 25-week cleanup involving more than 10,000
workers was a job well done. Alaska officials disagree and announce
their own $21 million winter cleanup plan.
   Oct. 10: State officials warn people not to consume shellfish in
areas affected by oil.
   Oct. 27: The National Wildlife Federation says Exxon has
resigned from its corporate advisory board. Exxon calls the
conservation group unfair in its criticism of the oil spill; the
group calls Exxon ``a corporate pariah.''
   Nov. 8: The U.S. House of Representatives passes a bill
preserving states' ability to adopt stricter oil spill liability
laws than the federal government. The Senate also is working on a
bill, but agreement is put off until 1990.
   Dec. 4: U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says
Exxon's cleanup has cost the company $1.9 billion, and praises
Exxon for ``a very substantial, good-faith effort.''
   Dec. 31: Wildlife officials report that more than 1,000 sea
otters, 140 bald eagles and nearly 36,500 seabirds have been found
dead in the spill area.
   Jan. 5, 1990: The Alaska Oil Spill Commission issues a report
calling for an overhaul of the nation's oil transportation system.
It blames the Valdez spill in part on the Coast Guard's ``unduly
friendly relationship with industry,'' and a reckless rush to
profits by the oil industry.
   Jan. 22: Hazelwood goes on trial in Anchorage, facing three
felony charges of criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of
reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil, and operating a
vessel while intoxicated.
   Feb. 20: The Coast Guard orders Exxon to resume its cleanup May
1 and to submit a plan by March 15.
   Tuesday, Feb. 27: A federal grand jury indicts Exxon and its
shipping subsidiary on five criminal counts. Officials say that if
convicted, the company could be fined up to $1.6 million if
convicted on all counts and could be assessed an additional $700
million in penalties.

<HEAD>Dukakis Regrets Missing `Great Time' to be President</HEAD>

   ``It's a great time to be president,'' said
Michael Dukakis, who isn't.
   The Massachusetts governor visited his would-be home for an East
Room reception with President Bush on Monday and afterward said he
knows he's missing out on a spate of good news.
   ``I don't stay up nights on the subject,'' Dukakis said. ``I
must say that this would be a great time to be president of the
United States.''
   Dukakis, who has had no such luck with affairs in Massachusetts
over the past year, reflected on how events have smiled on his
political nemesis.
   ``We're living through history here. This is unprecedented. The
Cold War has defined everything about our lives about our country,
about the world, and all of a sudden, nobody predicted it, it seems
to be sliding away.''
   The question, Dukakis said, is what Bush can make of the
opportunities that have fallen into his lap.
   ``It seems to me that this is a very good time for the country,
providing we take advantage of what is an extraordinary opportunity
to provide international leadership. ... If the administration does
a good job of that, then they're going to be successful, and if
they don't, then somebody else is going to be president.''
   Sporting a cast on his left hand because he broke two fingers on
Saturday trying to push a car out of snow, Dukakis made his second
trip to the White House since losing to Bush in the November 1988
presidential election. He is in town to take part in the annual
National Governors' Association meeting.
   As one with direct experience in the field of changing political
fortunes, Dukakis warned Bush not to grow over-confident,
especially now that a favorite Republican enemy _ communism _
appears to be waning as a major issue.
   ``The Republicans have always had this defense thing and, you
know, Bush used it against me and in retrospect, who was the most
accurate forecaster? It was the Democratic nominee,'' Dukakis said.
   ``You never know. Things change in this business.''
   The successful elections Sunday in Nicaragua, Dukakis said, are
an example of the bankruptcy of the Reagan-Bush policy of military
aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. It was a diplomatic approach
that opened the door to free elections, he said.
   ``What's the record? There was no progress toward genuinely
open, free, internationally supervised elections until the Contra
effort effectively was killed,'' Dukakis said. ``What does that
tell you?''
   Acting the part of a reporter, Dukakis quoted Bush as saying in
the closed-door luncheon with the governors that the defense budget
may be cut further.
   The governors were asking Bush whom the country should fear as
an enemy with the sudden turn of events in Eastern Europe.
   ``He said, `The enemy is instability.' OK, fine. But then he
said, `Look, we've already cut the defense budget substantially
below projected levels,' and he said, `it's probably going to be
cut even further.'''
   Dukakis said he has been too busy digging Massachusetts out of a
fiscal hole lately to think about his post-gubernatorial career. He
said he wants to remain involved in public affairs.
   As for future runs for political office, he said: ``I don't
think you ever say never to anything. Who knows.''

<HEAD>One in Four Young Blacks in Criminal Justice System, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``get tough'' approach is failing to deter
criminal activity by young black males, 23 percent of whom are
behind bars or on probation or parole, a non-profit group says.
   ``We now risk the possibility of writing off an entire
generation of black men from leading productive lives,'' said Marc
Mauer, assistant director of The Sentencing Project, which promotes
alternative punishments and sentencing reform.
   In a report issued Monday, the group said 609,690 black men age
20 through 29 _ nearly one in every four _ were in prison or jail
or on probation or parole in mid-1989.
   In contrast, only 436,000 black men in the same age group were
enrolled in college in 1986, the latest year for which figures were
available.
   ``These are shocking, disturbing numbers,'' said Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of the House Government Operations
Committee.
   Conyers said he would hold hearings but first wanted the General
Accounting Office, a congressional investigative agency, to conduct
a separate investigation.
   The past decade was ``an experiment in the get-tough approach to
crime,'' as the federal and state governments built more prisons,
imposed mandatory sentences and embraced capital punishment, the
report said.
   ``We will never build enough cells to house everyone that can be
brought into the prisons,'' Conyers said. ``Also, there's no
showing that increased incarceration has any deterrent effect
whatsoever.''
   For white men in the 20 to 29 age group, 1,054,508, or 6.2
percent, were incarcerated or on probation or parole. A total of
238,255 Hispanic males, or 10.4 percent, were in the criminal
justice system.
   Although fewer young women than men were in the system, there
were racial disparities: 164,249 whites, or 1 percent; 78,417
blacks, or 2.7 percent; and 37,093 Hispanics, or 1.8 percent.
   Stu Smith, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said the
report's numbers were accurate but declined further comment.
   The report blames social ills, including high unemployment
rates, for the disproportionate number of black men in the prison
system.
   Conyers agreed, noting that black men as a group are less
educated and in poorer health than their white counterparts. He
also said the criminal justice system was ``racist in impact if not
by intention,'' with blacks more likely than whites to receive
lengthy sentences or capital punishment.
   To reverse the trend for blacks, governments should prescribe
counseling and other alternatives to prison for young, first-time
offenders, the study said. For others, mandatory sentencing
guidelines should be loosened so judges can tailor each criminal's
punishment to his particular situation, it said.
   Prison should be a last resort after alternative punishments
have failed, the report said, urging governments to make greater
use of restitution to victims, community service, intensive
probation and employment and education programs.

<HEAD>Jackson Won't Run for DC Mayor; Revives Predictions of
Presidential Bid</HEAD>

   Jesse Jackson's political future is beginning
to resemble his past.
   His announcement Monday that he will not run for mayor of the
nation's capital revived the assumption that when the 1992
presidential campaign gets rolling, Jackson will make his third bid
for the White House.
   ``I want to continue to serve, but not as mayor,'' Jackson told
a news conference, ending speculation that he might run to succeed
the troubled Marion Barry as mayor of the District of Columbia, a
city without a state.
   Serve as what, was the next natural question.
   ``It is premature to talk about the next level of activity,'' he
replied to such queries. ``The push is for statehood.''
   Jackson established residence in Washington last spring, a move
that touched off speculation he would run for mayor. The talk
intensified after Barry was arrested on a misdemeanor cocaine
possession charge and later indicted on perjury charges.
   Many people were advising Jackson to run.
   They included some union and business leaders who regarded him
as the best possibility for lifting the city out of a cycle of
drugs and murder that has brought unwelcome headlines across the
nation.
   The advice also came from some of the veteran politicians who
worked on the late stages of Jackson's 1988 campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``I thought he ought to run,'' said John White, a former
Democratic national party chairman. ``It would give him a chance to
develop some credibility on big-time issues.''
   ``I thought he ought to do it,'' said Georgian Bert Lance, who
served as budget director for President Jimmy Carter. ``I thought
he could show his skill.''
   White and Lance speculated that Jackson's detractors would try
to turn his reluctance to take on the challenges of mayor against
him in the future.
   ``I don't know how much bypassing this kind of challenge in a
future race, how much negative impact that would have,'' White
said. ``But certainly he chose to pass it by.''
   The D.C. Council is considering authorizing the election of two
``shadow senators'' to lobby Congress for statehood. Jackson often
is mentioned as a shoo-in for election to such a post.
   ``I don't understand that shadow senator stuff,'' White said.
``I don't know whether he (Jackson) has a real interest in it. I've
never heard him discuss it.
   ``But for a real politician, I don't see much interest in it.
Politics is about power.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the man who defeated Jackson
in the race for the 1988 presidential nomination, reacted to
Jackson's announcement by saying:
   ``I'm sorry about that. He would have been a good candidate. The
job of mayor of the district is a national office in every sense of
the word. I wish he would have given it a whirl.''
   ``It's not good for the city, what's been happening,'' said Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas. ``And we need to look at the city with
pride again. He could have made a contribution.''
   ``At present I believe that I may best serve by continuing my
work on a national level to change the direction of this country. I
want to serve, but not as mayor,'' Jackson said.
   White said, ``You have to almost predict a rerun of '88.''

<HEAD>Wife, Sister of Two U.S. Hostages Optimistic About Releases</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Relatives of two Americans held captive
in Lebanon by pro-Iranian factions say they are more optimistic
than ever that all the Western hostages in that country will soon
be freed.
   ``I feel much better than I've ever felt. ... I feel very
confident that the hostages will be released,'' said Ferial
Polhill. Her husband Robert, who taught at Beirut University
College, was kidnapped on Jan. 24, 1987.
   Peggy Say, sister of Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, said: ``I feel something's
going to happen.''
   Anderson, 42, is the longest held of the 18 Westerners kidnapped
in Lebanon. He was abducted on March 16, 1985.
   ``There seems to be some kind of major impact looking at the
five-year anniversary of Terry Anderson,'' said Mrs. Say, who is
winding up a ``humanitarian pilgrimage'' with an AP delegation to
seek international support for the release of Anderson and the
other hostages.
   ``I think it outrages people that for five years he and the
other hostages have been held under such unspeakable conditions,''
said Mrs. Say, who has tirelessly lobbied for her brother's release.
   The other Western hostages are six Americans, four Britons, two
West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian. Most are
believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem factions linked to
Hezbollah, or Party of God, an anti-Western fundamentalist faction.
   Mrs. Say, of Cadiz, Ky., has met with Pope John Paul II, United
Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat.
   At the United Nations Monday, Kit and Joan Sutherland, daughters
of U.S. hostage Thomas Sutherland, presented Perez de Cuellar with
a petition containing 18,000 signatures from Colorado appealing for
help in seeking their father's release.
   Sutherland, on leave from Colorado State University at Fort
Collins, was abducted June 9, 1985, while serving as acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut.
   Mrs. Say flew to Cyprus from Damascus, Syria, where she had met
with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa and Information Minister
Mohammed Salman. Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon. Mrs.
Polhill, a Lebanese, had come from Beirut.
   The two women, sitting side by side in a Nicosia hotel, said
they were greatly encouraged by recent statements in Tehran and
Beirut about the hostages.
   ``I feel this way particularly after the statements by Iranian
officials and by Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,'' said Mrs.
Polhill. Fadlallah, Hezbollah's spiritual guide and the most
influential Shiite cleric in Lebanon, said Friday that ways had to
be found to free the hostages.
   Iran's Chief Justice, Mohammad Yazdi, declared Sunday that Islam
opposed hostage-taking and there was no need for diplomatic
maneuvering to free the hostages in Lebanon.
   ``This feeling is also prevalent in Beirut after the latest
statements. ... It appears the hostages will be released
unconditionally,'' Mrs. Polhill added.
   Mrs. Say said her increased optimism resulted ``from all the
people that I've seen.''
   Yazdi's statement came amid other indications that the Iranian
government was moving to distance itself from the hostages.
   The Tehran Times said in an editorial last week that the
American hostages held in Lebanon have become a tool to be used
against Iran and should be released. The English-language newspaper
generally reflects the thinking of President Hashemi Rafsanjani,
leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists.
   He is seeking to improve relations with the West to secure badly
needed investment and technology to revitalize Iran's moribund
economy.
   But he is opposed by radical fundamentalists who charge he is
deviating from the teachings of the Islamic republic's late
founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died June 3.
   The Tehran Times report was followed Sunday by an editorial in
Tehran's Ettela'at daily that said the groups holding the
foreigners should release them.

<HEAD>Government Doesn't Want AIDS Experts in Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government is refusing to send its AIDS
researchers into court to shed light on allegations that drug
companies failed to move swiftly enough to prevent their blood
products from transmitting the virus to children with hemophilia.
   The Centers for Disease Control contends AIDS researchers' time
is better spent in the laboratory. Lawyers for families of the AIDS
victims say they believe both justice and science can be served by
having the experts testify.
   ``Parents whose hemophiliac children have gotten AIDS from
AIDS-contaminated blood are shocked that the federal government is
refusing access to the truth about what information was given to
people in the blood business in the early 1980s about the
transmissibility of AIDS,'' said Laura Anderson, a Miami attorney
for families who are suing Armour Pharmaceutical of Bradley, Ill.,
and Cutter Laboratories of Berkeley, Calif.
   The government has won the first legal skirmishes, most recently
a ruling by a federal judge in Atlanta that CDC experts can't be
forced to testify in AIDS-related lawsuits.
   Senior U.S. District Judge Charles A. Moye Jr. said he was
concerned that compelling the experts to testify would subject the
CDC to ``an onslaught of subpoenas'' for testimony on AIDS.
   Lawyers for families of the AIDS victims hope to win
reconsideration of that ruling and a similar one in California.
   The lawyers want to question AIDS experts Bruce Evatt and Donald
Francis about their dealings with companies that make clotting
products from donated blood.
   According to documents filed in the case, CDC researchers sent
to at least one drug company a 1982 draft report saying
hemophiliacs ``should be advised of this risk'' _ a suggestion
missing from the CDC's subsequent official report.
   The documents also say that Francis advised a CDC colleague in a
January 1983 memo that he feared ``it might be too late'' to
prevent AIDS from spreading to hemophiliacs.
   But he urged that the CDC recommend using only a very small pool
of screened blood donors for manufacturing such products, even
though ``there will be objections by industry and blood bankers.''
   The Atlanta ruling, quashing a subpoena issued in Florida, means
Evatt does not have to testify. But a larger issue remains _ when,
if ever, CDC researchers should be compelled to testify in AIDS
lawsuits.
   The CDC has fielded about 50 requests in the last seven years
for testimony from three top AIDS specialists. The agency also has
responded to more than 200 inquiries from lawyers concerned with
such cases, according to the CDC.
   Moye, in his Feb. 6 order, said the plaintiffs have a reasonable
explanation for why they need Evatt's testimony, but ``their
interest in getting the deposition simply cannot compare to the
government's interest in maximizing the use of its limited
resources in dealing with a national health crisis.''
   The government contends research should take precedence.
   ``We've taken a fairly hard-nosed position on this,'' said CDC
legal adviser Gene Matthews. ``We simply can't let our doctors and
researchers, who are spread thin as it is ... peel off time and go
testifying.''
   A subpoena issued to Francis, a CDC expert in California, was
quashed by a federal magistrate there last year.
   Ms. Anderson suggested that if Evatt were allowed to testify in
her case, his testimony could be videotaped and saved for use in
other AIDS lawsuits.
   She raised the possibility that the government won't allow the
researchers to testify because of the possibility of embarrassing
material coming out.
   ``Nothing was ever articulated specifically, but that is sort of
by implication what is going on,'' Ms. Anderson said.
   CDC spokeswoman Gail Lloyd said the agency is not worried about
anything embarrassing coming out in court.
   Already, Ms. Lloyd said, ``we have supplied voluminous
documents. Everything we've ever had has been supplied. It is not
an effort to withhold information.''
   Francis and Evatt have refused to comment on the lawsuits, Ms.
Lloyd said.
   ``They're scientists, and they'd just as soon do science. The
issue here is a legal issue, not a scientific issue. On this issue,
they just don't feel it's their subject,'' she said.

<HEAD>`Driving Miss Daisy' Dominates Box Office Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Entertainment Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Driving Miss Daisy'' grossed $6.1 million at
the nation's theaters last weekend, its nine Oscar nominations
helping it hold the No. 1 position at the box office.
   Warner Bros. estimated the Academy Award nominations ``Miss
Daisy'' collected Feb. 14 would boost the film's revenues by $20
million, and so far the prediction is holding true, according to
figures from Exhibitor Relations Co.
   ``Miss Daisy,'' which grossed $10.8 million the previous
weekend, has now sold more than $53 million worth of tickets, with
the bulk of the income coming in the last several weeks. The movie
starring Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman as a Southern widow and
her black chauffeur opened in December.
   But ``Miss Daisy'' could be knocked from the No. 1 spot next
weekend by the much-anticipated ``The Hunt for Red October,''
starring Sean Connery.
   Another surprise hit, ``Hard to Kill,'' finished in second place
with receipts of $5.4 million, making $27.5 million in three weeks.
The poorly reviewed film stars Steven Seagal as a policeman with a
bad attitude. His wife, Kelly Le Brock, plays a supporting role.
   ``Madhouse,'' with John Larroquette and Kirstie Alley as a
couple entertaining impossible house guests, landed in third place
with a gate of $3.4 million. Fourth was the Kevin Costner film
``Revenge,'' which made $2.9 million and is fading.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' in fifth, has not enjoyed a
great boost from its eight Oscar nominations. The film collected
$2.5 million, but its per-screen average has weakened to $1,755.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Monday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' Warner Bros., $6.1 million, 1,432
screens, $4,265 per screen, $53.3 million, 11 weeks.
   2. ``Hard to Kill,'' Warner Bros., $5.4 million, 1,508 screens,
$3,600 per screen, $27.5 million, three weeks.
   3. ``Madhouse,'' Orion, $3.4 million, 1,554 screens, $2,205 per
screen, $9.6 million, two weeks.
   4. ``Revenge,'' Columbia, $2.9 million, 1,379 screens, $2,080
per screen, $10 million, two weeks.
   5. ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Universal, $2.5 million,
1,432 screens, $1,755 per screen, $56.8 million, 10 weeks.
   6. ``Men Don't Leave,'' Warner Bros., $2 million, 802 screens,
$2,503 per screen, $2.3 million, four weeks.
   7. ``Nightbreed,'' 20th Century Fox, $1.8 million, 1,488
screens, $1,235 per screen, $6.2 million, two weeks.
   8. ``Glory,'' Tri-Star, $1.68 million, 809 screens, $2,080 per
screen, $18.4 million, 11 weeks.
   9. ``Stella,'' Disney, $1.67 million, 1,291 screens, $1,293 per
screen, $15.6 million, four weeks.
   10. ``Steel Magnolias,'' Tri-Star, $1.2 million, 1,214 screens,
$995 per screen, $72.8 million, 15 weeks.

<HEAD>Nebraskans Kerrey, Yeutter at Odds Over Surplus Grain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department is likely to
continue a policy of releasing government-owned surplus grain into
the commercial market despite the objections of Sen. Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb.
   Kerrey had asked Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, a
Nebraskan on the opposite side of the political fence, to reverse a
decision to dump on the market 55 million to 60 million bushels of
corn owned by the Commodity Credit Corp.
   Kerrey, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said last
week that Yeutter's decision to issue new CCC ``catalogs,'' or
lists of grain inventories available to buyers, was ``a clear
signal to farmers'' that the Agriculture Department believes
current corn prices of $2.25 per bushel are too high.
   Yeutter, in a letter released Monday by USDA, told Kerrey that
the catalogs ``help to move grain out of more expensive commercial
storage and into the market to satisfy domestic and export demand.''
   Kerrey said last week that the Bush administration ``has been
lecturing farmers to become more `market-oriented' and rely less on
the government for their income, but its decision to sell still
more corn undermines the ability of farmers to heed that
directive.''
   Farmers who developed a thoughtful marketing plan have been told
by USDA ``that the government stands ready to erase any opportunity
for better prices,'' he said.
   Yeutter said he was troubled by Kerrey's request to keep the
corn in CCC storage because ``most Nebraska farmers know that, in
the long run, American agriculture is far better off moving grain
to market.''
   ``The early 1980s taught us that we can't store our way to
prosperity,'' Yeutter said. ``The grain recently cataloged had
already been in storage for at least two to three years.''
   According to recent USDA reports, corn exports are expected to
rise 12 percent this year, to around 2.275 billion bushels, and
domestic use may be up 9 percent, to more than 5.7 billion bushels.
   Thus, total corn use in the 1989-90 marketing year _ 7.98
billion bushels _ will exceed last fall's harvest of less than 7.53
billion bushels.
   As a result, U.S. corn stockpiles are expected to drop to 1.48
billion bushels by the start of the next marketing year Sept. 1,
the first time since 1983-84 that the carryover has been below 1.5
billion bushels.
   ``The tight stocks mean that corn prices will be sensitive to
weather conditions that may affect the planting and development of
the 1990 corn crop,'' one USDA analysis said.
   Projections by the department's Economic Research Service put
corn prices in the range of $2.20 to $2.40 per bushel, on the
average, over the 1989-90 marketing year, compared with $2.54
estimated for 1988-89 when drought reduced the supply and forced up
prices.

   Agriculture Department economists say brisk
exports and heavy domestic use are draining off U.S. cotton
inventories and boosting prices.
   Domestic mills used 7.8 million bales in 1988-89, the
department's Economic Research Service said Monday in a preliminary
report.
   ``This season, strong denim demand and apparel sales are
expected to push consumption to 8.2 million bales, the highest in
nearly two decades,'' the report said. ``Mill use for the first six
months of the season average about 8.4 million bales on a
seasonally adjusted annual rate.''
   Cotton exports are forecast at 7.7 million bales this season, up
25 percent from 6.15 million bales in 1988-89. As of mid-February,
outstanding sales and shipments totaled nearly 7 million bales,
compared with 4.7 million at this time last season.
   The U.S. cotton inventory by Aug. 1 is expected to be about 3.5
million bales, about half the 7.09 million on hand last Aug. 1.
   ``During the 1989-90 marketing year, both U.S. and world prices
for cotton have exceeded those of the past season by substantial
margins,'' the report said. ``The adjusted world price for August
to mid-November averaged 67 cents per pound this season, about 23
cents ahead of the comparable-period average last season.''
   World cotton production was projected at about 79 million bales
in 1989-90, down 6 percent from last year. Foreign production, at
around 67 million bales is down 3 percent. The U.S. harvest is
estimated at 12.2 million bales, down 21 percent.

   China is looking for foreign partners to set
up a joint dairy venture, says an Agriculture Department dispatch
from Beijing.
   Edwin A. Bauer, U.S. agricultural counselor reports that Chinese
dairy authorities are interested in foreign partners supplying
livestock, equipment and technical expertise.
   ``The main problem for U.S. firms wishing to enter such an
arrangement will be recouping the investment in exportable dairy
products or hard currency due to a shortage of both,'' he said.
   Bauer's report, included in the March issue of AgExporter
magazine, said China wants to boost national per capita milk
consumption from the current 3 kilograms to 5.4 kilos by 1992. One
kilogram is about 2.2 pounds.

   For the second time in a week, the Soviet
Union is planning to deny visas to members of Congress seeking to
watch local elections in that country, according to lawmakers and
the State Department.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., chairman of the U.S. Commission
on Security and Cooperation in Europe, on Monday criticized the
Soviets' failure to provide visas to a group of House members who
want to observe the elections in the Ukraine on Sunday.
   ``We don't understand why Moscow would want to keep U.S.
congressmen from observing the process of democratization in the
U.S.S.R.,'' DeConcini said in a statement. The commission monitors
the human rights aspects of the Helsinki accords.
   ``Moscow's clear unwillingness to permit U.S. legislators to
observe the political processes and elections runs counter to the
trend of improved U.S.-Soviet relations and parliamentary
contacts,'' he said.
   The group had planned to leave Thursday, but has yet to receive
entry permits.
   The Soviets have told the lawmakers they do not have proper
invitations to warrant visas, said Orest Deychak, a commission
staff member. House members were told invitations must be issued by
the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Soviet officials have given ``signals'' that visas would be
denied to Reps. Don Ritter, R-Pa., a commission member; John Edward
Porter, R-Ill.; David Drier, R-Calif.; Dennis Hertel, D-Mich.; Bob
McEwen, R-Ohio; and Dan Schaefer, R-Colo.
   The congressmen have not been officially notified that they will
not get visas.
   A telephone number provided by the Soviet Embassy to ask
questions about visas rang unanswered Monday.
   Last week, four House members flew to Berlin, intending to get
visas to watch elections in Lithuania on Saturday, the first
multiparty contest in the Soviet Union since after the Bolshevik
Revolution.
   The group arrived Wednesday in Berlin, where they remained until
after the elections. They were not permitted to enter Lithuania
until Sunday night, and they will return Tuesday.
   Last Friday, 11 senators wrote a letter of protest to Yuri
Dubinin, the Soviet ambassador to the United States, calling for
approval of the visas.
   In addition, Secretary of State James A. Baker III contacted
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze about the matter, a
State Department official said.
   Although the congressmen _ Reps. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.;
Christopher Cox, R-Calif.; John Miller, R-Wash.; and Bill
Sarpalius, D-Texas _ only managed one day in Lithuania, the trip
was worthwhile, said Durbin's spokeswoman, Melissa Batty.
   ``They met with people,'' she said, adding that Durbin, who is
of Lithuanian descent, also planned to visit his mother's hometown.
   She said the group went to Berlin because they had not expected
to have trouble obtaining their visas.

<HEAD>Private School President Refuses to Testify About Loans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The president of a private trade school is
refusing to answer Senate investigators' allegations that documents
were altered to fatten profits from federal guaranteed student
loans.
   ``On advice of counsel, I respectfully decline to answer the
question,'' Joseph A. Calareso, president of American Career
Training Corp., replied when asked whether he had instructed anyone
to doctor records.
   Staff members of the Senate Permanent Investigations
Subcommittee testified Monday that they found evidence suggesting
``intentional abuse of the guaranteed student loan system'' by the
corporation and its two arms: A.C.T. Travel School and Hart School
for Professional Secretaries, both in Pompano Beach, Fla.
   Investigators allege that from 1986 through 1989, $150 million
in loans were guaranteed for 60,000 students of the A.C.T. schools,
which combine home study with on-campus courses.
   Calareso and his brother, James, who own the school, paid
themselves $12 million in salary and stock dividends during that
time, the investigators said. Joseph Calareso earns $1.5 million a
year as president.
   ``I'm afraid they are just scratching the surface'' of deep
problems in the program, said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
subcommittee.
   The system, added Sen. William Roth, R-Del., ``seems to invite
fraud and abuse.''
   Subcommittee investigators David B. Buckley and Grace T.
McPhearson targeted the A.C.T. operations as part of a broader
probe of abuses in the student loan programs. A.C.T. was chosen
because of its heavy reliance on student loans.
   Brenda Ann Brandon said that when she was the organization's
financial-aid officer, the school was receiving 200 to 250
student-loan checks averaging $2,000 to $2,500 a week.
   Although federal regulations limit guaranteed loans to those who
have completed high school or who are obtaining an equivalency
diploma, ``some of the students literally could not read or write,
some could not speak the English language,'' Mrs. Brandon said.
   She said she had seen Joseph Calareso alter records of students
who had no high school diploma.
   In addition, Mrs. Brandon said, employees were instructed by
Joseph Calareso ``to contact every new student, even cash students,
and try and get them to finance their education through a
guaranteed student loan.''
   ``This way, the school was guaranteed to receive the full
tuition up front,'' she said. ``If a cash student is on a payment
plan, there is a lower probability that the school will receive all
of the tuition, because the majority of the students enrolled never
complete the course.''
   Senate investigators contend that:
   _In 1986 through 1989, 90 percent of A.C.T. students _ including
some who did not meet federal requirements _ received federal aid
but only 16 percent completed their courses.
   _The schools list only 23 instructors but 109 sales
representatives trying to recruit students. In 1989, from each
$1,000 of revenue, the schools spent $4 on classroom materials, $14
on instructors' salaries and $338 on advertising.
   _In 1985, the first year it was eligible to participate in
federal student-loan programs, A.C.T. revenues increased by 800
percent, to $5.5 million, investigators testified. Revenues reached
$34.5 million in 1989.
   Andrea Lynn Merritts-West of New Smyrna Beach, Fla., told the
subcommittee that within a week after enrolling in the travel
school, she received a filled-in form that _ she learned months
later _ was an application for a guaranteed student loan.
   She said she received a $2,650 check from A.C.T. and, following
instructions, endorsed it and returned it to the school. She
dropped out a few months later and eventually was notified by a
private lender that she was about to default on a government loan.
   ``This is the first time that I had ever been told that I had
received a government student loan,'' she said.

<HEAD>`Fatsats,' `Lightsats' May Reduce Cost of Space Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increasing the payload on a spacecraft can
make it more economical, but so can sending up a series of smaller
satellites, a congressional study says.
   The Office of Technology Assessment proposes ``fatsats,''
``lightsats,'' and ``microspacecraft'' as possible solutions in the
quest for a cheaper space program.
   With payloads costing up to $800,000 a pound, the congressional
office has been looking at offbeat technologies that can reduce
costs. One idea in the study released Monday proposes to launch
10,000 small projectiles a year for as little as $500 a pound for
the payload and $20 a pound for the launcher.
   ``Unless spacecraft costs are reduced, even dramatic reductions
in launch costs will have only a small effect on total spacecraft
program costs,'' said the report ``Affordable Spacecraft: Design
and Launch Alternatives.''
   The study follows OTA's ``Buyer's Guide'' to launch options, its
``Big, Dumb Booster: A Low-Cost Space Transportation Option,'' and
its study of human spaceflight. A summary report on space
transportation will be published in the spring.
   Reducing the cost of launchers will have only a small impact on
overall costs and new strategies are needed to cut the cost of
payloads, the report concludes.
   The report proposes:
   _Requiring payload designers to include a margin for weight
overruns to avoid the long delays and high cost of redesigning
spacecraft that tend to grow in size and weight during production
and ``gross out'' their intended launchers.
   _Allowing ``fatsats,'' or spacecraft that are built larger, with
less-expensive materials to keep costs down. The money saved can
far exceed the increased cost of a larger launcher.
   _Making more ``lightsats'' that weigh less but have fewer
capabilities. The idea is that for some applications, launching an
array of small and simple satellites instead of one large
sophisticated vehicle could cut costs.
   _Building small instruments for small, rugged satellites that
can be launched by laser-powered or cannon-like launchers.
   The study suggests several options for Congress, including
legislation that would require two design contracts for a selected
new spacecraft: a conventional one and one that would consider
unconventional approaches.
   OTA proposes that Congress require the National Aeronautics
Space Administration to include 15 percent weight margins in its
new designs.
   The study also suggests funding of programs to build larger
launchers that could carry ``fatsats'' and continued funding for
military development of launch vehicles for ``lightsats.''

<HEAD>Mexico City Mayor Announces Tougher Actions Combat Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ISAAC A. LEVI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After getting residents to cut back on
driving, officials of this smog-choked metropolis are expanding
anti-pollution measures to move steel works out of town and
encourage buses and trucks to use propane.
   In addition, all vehicles will now be required to submit to
emissions inspections.
   The new measures Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis announced Monday
step up the battle to cut some of the 4.8 million tons of
pollutants spewed every year into the air breathed by the capital's
18 million residents.
   ``We are determined, and we have the overwhelming support of an
equally determined citizenry, to go ahead and make next winter even
less contaminated than this winter was,'' the mayor told a news
conference.
   An experimental program that started Nov. 20 _ its main feature
being to force people not to drive one day a week _ had been
scheduled to end Wednesday but was extended for at least two months.
   The period corresponded to the winter season's thermal
inversions, when cold air traps huge quantities of toxic gases
during the early hours of the morning in the Valley of Mexico.
   Camacho said the program was so successful that, when city
authorities conducted a series of public opinion polls, 70 to 90
percent of those questioned said they favored extending it.
   While the measure only was intended to cut pollution by 23
percent, the reduction was only about half that.
   Still, Camacho said, you can see the results: ``On many days you
could even see the volcanoes surrounding the city very clearly.''
   Similarly, Camacho announced that the sale of oxygenated
gasoline and the substitution of natural gas for fuel oil in Mexico
City two huge power plants _ part of the experimental program _
would continue.
   Adding the oxygen-compound additive to gasoline raises
combustion levels and sharply reduces pollutants, especially in
Mexico where emission control devices are not mandatory, experts
say.
   Petroleos Mexicanos S.A., the goverment's oil monopoly, will
continue providing 109 million cubic feet of natural gas to replace
the 16,000 barrels of fuel oil the capital's two power plants had
burned daily, he said.
   By the time winter sets in again next November, Camacho said,
all metal foundries will be forced to resettle outside the valley
under an agreement the city recently negotiated with the state of
Mexico.
   The rest of the area's industries will be gradually forced to
install anti-pollution devices or move out, Camacho said.
   Camacho said Pemex will also start marketing low-cost liquid
propane gas to encourage bus lines and delivery trucks to convert
their gasoline engines to the less polluting fuel.
   Also for next winter, all taxis, trucks and buses will be forced
to undergo periodic emission control testing. Testing was required
only for private automobiles this winter.

<HEAD>Activists Say They'll Continue Fight Against Military Ban on Gays</HEAD>

   Gay rights activists say a Supreme Court
rebuff will not deter their continuing fight to overturn a general
ban on homosexuals in the armed forces.
   ``There are other remedies for us to take care of this deeply
irrational policy,'' said Peri Jude Radecic of the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force. ``We've had a great deal of congressional
interest in this. Within the next year, you'll see some good things
coming from Congress.''
   The court Monday refused to disturb Pentagon policy, which says
``homosexuality is incompatible with military service.''
   The court rejected appeals by Miriam Ben-Shalom, denied
re-enlistment in the Army Reserve in Wisconsin because she is a
lesbian, and James M. Woodward of Spring Valley, Calif., released
from active Navy duty because he is gay.
   ``The refusal to allow lesbian and gay Americans to enlist in
the military constitutes what is probably the most blatant example
of official discrimination by the federal government today,'' said
Nan Hunter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Ms. Ben-Shalom said after the court's announcement that she may
leave the United States.
   ``I've considered Holland because they consider people like me
as legitimate political refugees,'' she said.
   Army spokesman Joe Padilla said the service was ``pleased that
this longstanding litigation ... is finally terminated and that our
position has been upheld.''
   Ms. Ben-Shalom, who joined the Army Reserve in 1974 and rose to
rank of sergeant, served out an enlistment that ended in August
1988.
   The Army bars ``persons who engage in homosexual conduct or who
by their statements demonstrate a propensity to engage in
homosexual conduct.''
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the policy in
August, but noted that there never was a complaint about Ms.
Ben-Shalom's military record.
   Woodward was allowed to enlist in 1972 for a six-year hitch in
the Naval Flight Officer Candidate Program even though he answered
``yes'' to a questionnaire asking whether he was sexually attracted
to men or desired sex with men. Woodward wrote ``no'' when asked
whether he ever had engaged in homosexual conduct.
   The Navy has allowed some homosexuals to serve despite its
general policy.
   Ensign Woodward was serving in the Philippines in 1974 when he
was seen in the Subic Bay Officers' Club sitting with a sailor who
was to be discharged for homosexual conduct.
   Questioned by his commanding officer, Woodward acknowledged his
homosexual tendencies but said, ``For the good of both the Navy and
myself, I respectfully request the chance to contribute to the
defense of the United States as an honest, open, `gay' officer.''
   The Navy released him from active duty and assigned him to the
Naval Air Reserve staff in San Diego, where he served until his
discharge in 1978.
   In other action Monday, the Supreme Court:
   _Heard arguments over a federal regulation putting Postal
Service property off-limits to solicitors of contributions. A
ruling is expected by July.
   _Said it will decide in a West Virginia case whether a federal
law that requires some losers of lawsuits to pay the winners'
lawyer fees also covers fees for expert witnesses.
   _Refused to force the CIA to release documents on the 1985
sinking of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior by French government
agents.
   _Let stand a 15-year prison sentence and a $6.6 million fine
imposed on California businessman Edward Elkins for selling two
airplanes with a potential military use to Libya.

<HEAD>Waste Crisis Said Averted at Rocky Flats Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins says a waste
storage problem that threatened the future of the Rocky Flats
nuclear weapons plant has been resolved, at least until late 1991.
   That's a rare piece of welcome news for Rocky Flats, which is
shut down for safety and management improvements. The plant, 16
miles northwest of Denver, also is under FBI investigation for
possible criminal violation of environmental laws.
   Rocky Flats is the nation's sole source of plutonium triggers
for nuclear weapons.
   Watkins told a meeting of the National Governors Association on
Monday that a program of ``waste minimization'' at Rocky Flats will
keep the plant within its limits of plutonium waste storage until
August. By then, he said, the department expects to begin operating
a special waste compactor that will enable Rocky Flats to handle
all its own waste until late 1991. No specific date was mentioned.
   It was thought that Rocky Flats would reach its waste limit this
spring.
   Rocky Flats had been sending its excess waste to a weapons
facility in Idaho, but when Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus blocked further
shipments last year, Watkins launched an ill-fated effort to
persuade seven states _ Colorado, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, New
Mexico, Tennessee and South Carolina _ to take equal amounts of
Rocky Flats waste.
   Watkins pleaded on national security grounds, but all seven
states turned him down.
   The Watkins seven-state plan was based on the assumption that
Rocky Flats would reach its waste storage limit of 1,600 cubic
yards by March or April 1990.
   The department recently indicated that the crunch might be
delayed slightly, but Watkins' statement Monday was the first word
of a major change in circumstances.
   Eventually, the Rocky Flats waste is supposed to go to a
permanent underground storage site in the New Mexico desert, but
efforts to open that facility _ originally scheduled for 1988 _
have been plagued by delay. Watkins has said the New Mexico dump
could be available late this year, but new delays are possible and
the facility is unlikely to be in full operation until 1992 or
later.
   In his remarks to the governors meeting, Watkins said the key to
relieving the waste-storage pressure at Rocky Flats was a program
undertaken by the department and its Rocky Flats contractor to
``segregate and minimize'' the generation of plutonium wastes.
   ``This effort has been effective in reducing the generation rate
from 130 cubic yards per month in March 1989 to 70 cubic yards per
month,'' Watkins said.
   Calls to Watkins' aides seeking additional details on how waste
generation was minimized were not returned.
   In a related development, the department issued a report
critical of Rockwell International Corp., which operated Rocky
Flats until the end of last year. The company agreed to withdraw
from its contract early because of a dispute with Watkins over its
approach to Rocky Flats' environmental and safety problems.
   The department said it was paying Rockwell $2 million for
running Rocky Flats from April through September 1989, a cut from
the $8.2 million it could have earned. The department said
Rockwell's handling of environmental, safety and health programs
was unsatisfactory and that management was ``not totally
responsive'' to the department's requirements.
   Rockwell insisted it put a high priority on environmental and
safety issues.

<TEXT>
   The Legislature is opening a special
session with its work cut out for it by the courts, which found
Texas discriminates in the way it funds schools and elects judges.
   Gov. Bill Clements called the 30-day session beginning today
after the state Supreme Court found ``glaring disparities'' in
funding available to rich and poor districts and after a federal
court ruled that judicial elections in nine urban counties
discriminated against minorities.
   The state court gave lawmakers until May 1 to overhaul financing
for the nation's second-largest school system, with 3.3 million
students in 1,100 districts. Only California's school system is
larger.
   Texas schools are funded with local property taxes and state
aid; funding totals more than $13 billion a year. The court found
that because of disparities in property values, annual spending per
student among Texas districts ranges from $2,112 to $19,333.
   In a 9-0 ruling in October, the court said it would not tell the
Legislature how to correct the inequities or order it to increase
taxes, but warned: ``A Band-Aid will not suffice; the system itself
must be changed.''
   At least six major funding proposals, including one costing more
than $1 billion, are before legislators.
   But state Comptroller Bob Bullock warned lawmakers there is no
money available for school funding reform. ``If they do spend
additional money they need to raise it ... or forever hold their
peace,'' he said Monday.
   The superintendent of San Antonio's Edgewood school district _
the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit challenging the current school
funding system _ said it's time the system was made fairer.
   ``It's been too long that thousands of children in this state,
over the last 20 years, have had to go through systems of education
that did not provide them the quality of education because of a
lack of basic equity in the school finance system,'' James Vasquez
said.
   The Legislature was forced to take up election reform after a
federal judge found that countywide elections for district judges
in nine counties violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by watering
down black and Hispanic voting strength.
   At the time of U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton's ruling in
November, non-Hispanic whites held 155 of the 172 district
judgeships in the nine counties, while blacks and Hispanics make up
about one-third of the state's poulation.
   Bunton began dividing the counties into judicial districts in
line and in January he ordered special elections in May for 115
judgeships in the counties _ nearly one-third of the state's 375
district judges.
   But a federal appeals court halted the elections, saying
lawmakers should be allowed to draw up the judicial districts.

<HEAD>Police Tailing Foreign Journalists More Since Martial Law Lifted</HEAD>

   Foreign journalists say plainclothes police have
been tailing them more often _ even while they jog or shop _ in the
month since the government lifted martial law in the Chinese
capital.
   Reporters said Monday that as a result they have been more
cautious about talking to Chinese, not wanting to get them in
trouble with authorities.
   ``Several (Chinese) contacts have been hauled before the leaders
in their (work) units and told, `We know you had contact with a
foreign journalist and this must stop,''' said a British reporter.
   Like the other journalists, he spoke on condition of anonymity
for fear of provoking official retaliation against his Chinese
friends.
   Correspondents from nearly a dozen news organizations, including
those from the United States, Soviet Union and Europe, said they
have been tailed at least once by plainclothes police in recent
weeks.
   Since June, when the government crushed student-led protests for
democracy, official access has been more limited, and even many
ordinary factories and offices are afraid to let reporters visit
for interviews.
   Under martial law imposed in Beijing during the protests,
foreign reporters were required to get military approval for all
interviews. The requirement lapsed with the Jan. 11 lifting of
martial law, but the police surveillance appeared to be a
substitute measure.
   The British reporter said he had been tailed each of the past
three days, and that on one occasion plainclothes police tried to
photograph him meeting a Chinese friend in a park.
   The next day, police followed him to a hotel where he met a
Chinese acquaintance, and three motorcycles and a van followed his
car from the hotel, keeping pace when he accelerated and drove in
circles. After he dropped off the Chinese man, police pursued the
man on foot, the reporter said.
   An American reporter who noticed she was being tailed by a man
on a bicycle said it made her decide not to visit Chinese friends,
``so I guess it's working.''
   She and several other reporters believe the surveillance, which
in many cases has been obvious, is intended to discourage them from
normal contacts with Chinese friends or news sources.
   ``What we're all terribly concerned about is getting a Chinese
in trouble,'' said another American reporter who said he and his
wife were followed even when they went jogging.
   In the past, Chinese have been accused of giving state secrets
to foreigners with whom they were friendly, and in some instances
have been jailed.
   Others have been denied promotions or the chance to study abroad
because of friendship with a foreigner.
   Without Chinese friends, foreigners find themselves cut off
entirely from Chinese society, isolated in their separate apartment
compounds and with little access to officials.
   China does not censor the writings of foreign reporters.
However, it censors foreign news entering the country.
   Authorities tear out articles they consider objectionable before
allowing newspapers and magazines to go on sale in hotels.
Chinese-language broadcasts of the U.S.-run radio station, the
Voice of America, have been jammed since June.

<HEAD>Government Could Save Billion Dollars a Year on Foreign Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Congressional Budget Office says the
federal government could save $5.45 billion over five years by
ending subsidized loans that help sell U.S. products abroad.
   Outlays of $4.3 billion are foreseen from 1991 to 1995 under the
``Food for Peace'' program, which provides loans to Third World
countries to buy surplus U.S. farm products.
   Loans can be extended to 40 years at interest rates averaging 2
percent to 3 percent a year, a much longer term and much lower rate
than any bank would provide.
   The detailed report by the bipartisan agency, which presents
pros and cons but does not make recommendations to Congress,
recently became available.
   Typically, according to the report on possible changes in
revenue and spending, the subsidies average 70 percent of the
market price. Governments that buy the food sell it on their home
markets and use the proceeds for development projects or other
official spending.
   ``The marketing of some food commodities, most notably wheat and
wheat flour, still relies significantly on food-aid programs,'' it
said.
   Some recipient countries, according to the report, complain that
the loans are not really aid because most must eventually be repaid.
   The report said the money from sales is being used increasingly
for development projects and that the loans remain one of the few
international policy tools in U.S. government hands.
   To sell American industrial products, subsidized loans are made
by the government's Export-Import Bank, largely in the Third World.
Savings from abolishing it are estimated at $1.15 billion over five
years.
   The loans are defended on the ground they create jobs, counter
similar subsidies from U.S. competitors such as France and Japan,
and help U.S. high-technology companies keep up high rates of
output.
   However, the report said, much of the aid is given to exports
that don't face foreign competition.
   ``Direct subsidies to U.S. manufacturing would be more
cost-effective,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Kaifu Re-Elected Prime Minster With New-Found Muscle</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to UPDATE with upper house approval. Picks
up 5th pvs, `Both houses ...'
^By TETSUO JIMBO</NOTE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was re-elected to
Japan's highest government post Tuesday, and immediately began
efforts to form a Cabinet that will reflect his new-found political
muscle.
   Kaifu bowed as his formal re-election was proclaimed after a
vote in the lower house of Parliament and hailed by a round of
rousing applause and scattered cheers.
   Of 508 valid votes cast in the 512-seat chamber, Kaifu won 286.
His closest rival, Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi, received
146 votes. Kaifu needed 255 votes for a majority.
   Immediately after the lower house vote, Kaifu rushed off without
comment to meet party leaders to work out a Cabinet lineup.
   In the 252-seat upper house, which is controlled by the
opposition, Kaifu failed to win a clear majority in the first round
of voting, but won in a run-off with 111 of the 246 votes cast. Ms.
Doi garnered 91 votes, and 44 ballots were left blank.
   The decision of the lower house is final, as the chamber by law
can name a prime minister without upper house assent. A lack of
consensus is rare, however. When Kaifu first assumed office six
months ago, he was the first prime minister in 41 years not
nominated by both houses.
   Both houses convened Tuesday for a special 120-day session, the
first since Kaifu steered his Liberal Democratic Party through
difficult elections for the lower house Feb. 18.
   Kaifu has strengthened his hand since the elections but powerful
party leaders have challenged his move to keep scandal-tainted
politicians from the new Cabinet, officials said Monday.
   Kaifu and party elders agreed Monday to reappoint Finance
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama,
party officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The
ministers were to continue work on issues such as an unpopular
sales tax and trade friction with the United States.
   The tax and an influence-peddling scandal, which tainted many
party elders, stirred doubts over whether the Liberal Democrats
could keep their 34-year-old hold on power.
   Kaifu, who has a clean image but weak power base, assumed the
party leadership in August after the influence-peddling and a sex
scandal forced two predecessors to step down, and the party lost
upper house elections in July.
   Kaifu, 59, formed an unusually young Cabinet and, for the first
time, gave two important ministerial posts to women. But his image
suffered from a public perception of him as manipulated by elders,
who assumed low profiles because of links to the Recruit scandal.
   The Feb. 18 voting left the Liberal Democrats with a comfortable
lower house majority, however, and Kaifu suggested the results
should strengthen his leadership position.
   Last week, Kaifu strongly opposed recommendations to name two
lawmakers linked to the Recruit scandal to top party posts, party
officials said. After lengthy negotiations, Kaifu appointed only
one.
   But two major factions within the governing party have suggested
Kaifu include in the new Cabinet at least two senior politicians
linked to bribery scandals, despite the prime minister's efforts to
protect his administration's image, news reports said.
   The faction led by former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe insisted
that former Education Minister Yoshiro Mori, who was one of 16
politicians linked to the Recruit stock scandal, should be given
one of the most prestigious posts, party officials said.
   Kaifu, however, took an unusually strong stance and told party
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa he would not include politicians
tainted by the Recruit scandal. Ozawa eventually convinced Abe to
withdraw his request, and, by late Monday, Mori announced he would
not seek a post in the Cabinet.
   One party official said it would have been ``unthinkable for Mr.
Kaifu to exert such a strong initiative'' before the election.
   Another powerful faction led by former Finance Minister Michio
Watanabe has been insisting that Takayuki Sato, who was given a
suspended sentence in the Lockheed bribery scandal in the 1970s, be
included in the Cabinet, officials said.
   The Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed Japan since it
was formed in 1955, comprises four major factions and two smaller
groups, including Kaifu's. It is considered one of the prime
minister's most important tasks to form a Cabinet based on his own
desires without upsetting the factional balance.
   In the 1988 scandal surrounding the Recruit Co., key politicians
acknowledged they received large donations from the information
conglomerate in return for political favors.

   Miriam Ben-Shalom said she has lost faith in
the country she wants to serve after the U.S. Supreme Court left
intact a military policy that keeps her out of the Army Reserve
because she is a lesbian.
   ``I keep wondering if there is a place out there that will
accept me for the human being that I am,'' Ms. Ben-Shalom, who
fought the ban on homosexuals for 16 years, said Monday night.
   ``I feel devastated, I am angry, I am hurt, I am outraged,'' she
said. ``I also have lost faith in America. I still love America,
but will somebody please tell me what I need to do to be fit? For
the rest of my life will appear the words `unfit to serve her
country.'''
   Ms. Ben-Shalom, 41, joined the Reserve in 1974 and was
discharged in 1976 after she acknowledged being a lesbian. Army
policy at the time barred anyone who ``evidenced homosexual
tendencies, desire or interest.''
   A federal judge ordered Ms. Ben-Shalom reinstated, and she
served out an enlistment that ended in August 1988. But she was
barred from re-enlisting under amended Army policy that calls
homosexuality ``incompatible with military service.''
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in August upheld the
policy. Although acknowledging there never was any complaint about
Ms. Ben-Shalom's performance of her military duties, the court said
the Army acted to protect ``morale, discipline and the
effectiveness of our fighting forces.''
   On Monday, the Supreme Court, without comment, refused to hear
Ms. Ben-Shalom's appeal.
   ``We are pleased that this longstanding litigation brought by
Ms. Miriam Ben-Shalom against the U.S. Army is finally terminated
and that our position has been upheld,'' Army spokesman Joe Padilla
said.
   The court also summarily rejected an appeal by James M. Woodward
of Spring Valley, Calif., who sued in 1976 after he was released
from active duty in the Navy because he is gay.
   In both cases, the Supreme Court did not rule on the legality of
the ban.
   ``My record and the record of all the other gay veterans speak
for themselves,'' Woodward said Monday. ``I wasn't on the fast
track for an admiralty or anything, but I was a competent officer
and did my job.''
   Both former soldiers promised to continue their fight through
other channels, including Congress and veterans' groups.
   Ms. Ben-Shalom said the ban on homosexuals persecutes people for
being honest. ``Right now, there are a class of people who _ if
they tell the truth about themselves _ they are considered to be
felons. I think that stinks,'' she said.
   Ms. Ben-Shalom, who teaches at a high school and a technical
college in Milwaukee, said she fears an unfavorable discharge could
affect her teaching career.
   But she said the Army will have to acknowlege that she has ``an
impeccable service record.''
   ``The fact of the matter is that they can't pretend that I was
never there,'' she said.

   If progressive ideas were a stock, now would
be the time to buy because conservatism is dead, says Democratic
New York Mayor David N. Dinkins.
   ``The crest of the conservative flood has passed,'' Dinkins, a
Democrat, told the National Press Club on Monday. ``The Republicans
still occupy the White House, but the conservative coalition has
lost its way.''
   He said the revolutions in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union
herald the death of communism. That, in turn, mean the end of the
influence of U.S. conservatives, he said.
   ``Without communism, they have no enemy, and without an enemy,
they have no energy,'' he said.
   He also predicted that the political right will not be able to
win office by running as anti-abortionists, citing as proof his
election and alluding to the elections of New Jersey Gov. James
Florio and Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder.
   ``Who would have thought a year ago that even the chairman of
the Republican National Committee would claim to be agnostic on
abortion?'' he asked. ``The effort to make God a partisan political
being has failed. She will judge our performance later.''

<HEAD>Teachers Want States to Require Geography</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new survey shows high school teachers want
students to get closer to geography in order to graduate.
   The nationwide survey of 852 elementary and secondary school
social studies and geography teachers found 86 percent favored
changing requirements to require that high school students pass a
geography course in order to graduate. Eighty-seven percent want
state governments to increase geography requirements.
   The Rand McNally Report on Geography Education in America,
conducted by Ketchum Communications Research and Measurement, was
released Monday on the heels of the first study of geography
education by the National Assessment of Educational Progress.
   That report said high school seniors have a gap in their
knowledge of geography, with only 37 percent able to find Southeast
Asia on a world map. The average student could answer just 57
percent of the questions and the best score among more than 3,000
students tested was 59 percent, the report showed.

<HEAD>Extra MH-47E Boeing Helicopters Unneeded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department doesn't have a ``sound
mission-based justification'' to spend an estimated $532 million to
buy 34 additional helicopters for commando missions, a
congressional report says.
   But the Defense Department said plans to cancel the new V-22
Osprey vertical takeoff airplane make the additional helicopters
necessary.
   The General Accounting Office said Monday the Army based its
decision to buy 34 MH-47E helicopters from The Boeing Co.'s
Philadelphia-based Helicopters Division, in addition to its own
needs of 17, on a May 1984 agreement between the Army and the Air
Force.
   The accord said the Air Force would transfer the responsibility
for providing helicopter support for commando operations to the
Army.
   But in June 1987, the Defense Department told Congress that it
had revised its requirements and only needed 17 MH-47E helicopters,
and 41 MH-53J helicopters, to fly these missions of about 265 to
520 miles.
   ``The Army's reason for procuring an additional 34 MH-47E
aircraft is based on an earlier memorandum of agreement between the
Air Force and the Army, which has been superseded by the 1987
report,'' the GAO said.

   They were full of vigor and
revolutionary fervor, fresh from the mountains and battles and
ready to spread the gospel of Marx.
   As their 10{ years in power came to an end, they could list
among their accomplishments improved educational and health systems
and, in a final irony that could only be confirmed by accepting
defeat, democracy.
   They were the Sandinistas, young guerrillas who looked to Cuba's
socialist society as a model after they smashed the corrupt
capitalist system of dictator Anastasio Somoza's regime.
   In recent years, dismayed by the disparity between economic
theory and practice, they denied they were Marxists and became
believers in private property and a mixed economy.
   They sought improved relations with a Roman Catholic Church they
had attacked and vilified in the person of Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo.
   But they were booted on Sunday by an electorate fed up with
economic crisis, the eight-year war with U.S.-backed Contra rebels,
internal political polarization and a confrontation with Washington
that led to regional isolation.
   ``I don't think we were ever real Marxists,'' said a
high-ranking official on condition of anonymity. ``We read mostly
bad translations in Mexico. We will probably end up as social
democrats.''
   But whether Marxists or social democrats, the Sandinistas with
their black-and-red bandannas, their youthfully dogmatic policies,
anti-U.S. rhetoric and social reforms left an imprint on the soul
of Nicaragua.
   ``There is no question that there was a revolution here and it
cannot be reversed whether you agree with it or not,'' said the
Rev. Bismarck Carballo, a bitter critic of the Sandinistas.
   Even critics acknowledge that the Sandinistas changed Nicaragua
and like to speculate on how things might have been different had
the Sandinistas not been so bitterly anti-American.
   The United States, which provided nearly $100 million in aid in
the months following the Somoza overthrow, turned against them,
accusing them of domestic repression and of going back on pledges
they would found a politically pluralistic and democratic society.
   Eventually, the United States financed the Contra rebels that
tied up tens of thousands of Sandinista soldiers and drained more
than 40 per cent of the country's budget.
   The Sandinistas' first accomplishment was a massive literacy
campaign in which they involved young idealistic youths who went
into the mountains to suffer with peasants while teaching them to
read and write along with the basic tenets of Sandinismo, a
nationalist mixture of populism and Marxism.
   As they pulled away from their Central American neighbors and
from the United States, they brought in Cuban and Eastern European
technicians to build schools and hospitals.
   Their concern for social needs made them popular among the
so-called ``internationalist set'' that attached itself to
anti-U.S. causes.
   They confiscated banks and controlled foreign trade. They
established free higher education, eliminated polio and reduced
infant mortality, established price controls and gave away tens of
thousands of lots for housing.
   Brigades of volunteers from Europe and the United States came to
Nicaragua to help pick coffee in the daytime and sing revolutionary
songs at night.
   The Sandinistas confiscated tens of thousands of acres, giving
it to thousands of landless peasants whom they organized into
cooperatives.
   But that and the draft drove thousands into the arms of the
Contras and created hostility across broad swaths of the
countryside.
   They antagonized a powerful business class, confiscating
property, and irritated the establishment church in this staunchley
Roman Catholic land with their support of the so-called popular
church.
   Many companies became property of the state and began losing
money under the guidance of inexperienced and dogmatic managers who
sacrificed efficiency in the name of worker control or
egalitarianism.
   The Sandinistas also irritated their regional neighbors with
open support of the leftist rebels of neighboring El Salvador, who
found a haven in Nicaragua and a steady supply of weapons.
   Eventually bureaucracy, rigid state planning and a U.S. economic
embargo sent the Sandinista economy into a dive.
   ``They defeated the Contra militarily, but they could not defeat
the economic crisis,'' said Mauricio Diaz, leader of the Social
Christian Party.
   Their economy became closely tied to that of Eastern European
countries and Cuba.
   For years practically every local product was rationed, gasoline
was limited to 20 gallons a month per car and most imported items
were expensive and of low quality.
   ``We were not just committed to economic growth, but to social
and economic equality,'' wrote governnent official Edmundo Jarquin
in a recent article.
   In recent years, under pressure from European countries and as
their East bloc allies abandoned centrally planned socialism, the
Sandinistas began seeking closer ties with the United States.
   Their biggest accomplishment, ironically, caused their undoing.
   They promised and carried out a clean, fair election, and when
the electorate turned against them they promised to respect the
voters' decision.
   ``We are proud, regardless of the results, to give Nicaragua and
the underdeveloped countries of America a bit of dignity, a bit of
democracy and a bit of social justice,'' Ortega said with painful
pride as he acknowledged defeat.

<TEXT>
   A fine cast, which included a performer making
his Metropolitan Opera debut, made ``Abduction from the Seraglio''
a musical and visual treat.
   James Levine conducted the Mozart comedy with dash on Monday
night.
   Lars Magnusson, a principal lyric tenor with the Royal Opera in
Stockholm, was making his U.S. opera debut as Pedrillo, servant of
Belmonte, a Spanish nobleman. It's the role he sang for his 1987
debut at Covent Garden and will sing for his San Francisco Opera
debut next season.
   He has an unusual light tenor voice. It doesn't get heavy but it
does have character.
   It's as though it has been given a light layer of wood-grained
baritone tonal quality, the way colored varnish might be brushed
onto a light wood. It sounds right for David in ``Die
Meistersinger,'' which was Magnusson's Paris Opera debut role.
   Stanford Olsen of Salt Lake City provided a good tenor contrast
as Belmonte. Olsen sounded serious, his voice focused and seemingly
ready to sing oratorio.
   Mariella Devia of Imperia, Italy, sang Konstanze, the young
woman who has been captured by pirates and sold to the Pasha for
his harem. Her maid, Blondchen, and Pedrillo are captives in the
Pasha's residence _ seraglio _ with her.
   Miss Devia's singing was like a string of pearls, her tone
sweet, each note carefully rounded and clear. Both she and Barbara
Kilduff as Blonchen had coloratura passages and both sang them
beautifully.
   Miss Kilduff's acting was more understated and less relentlessly
pert than some who sing Blonchen. But Magnusson was more nimble
than most who sing Pedrillo, so the balance of that pair of
sweethearts was maintained.
   Bass Kurt Moll of Buir, Germany, was Osmin, the Pasha's
overseer. He was the only one in the cast who sang his part when
this production was introduced in 1979. Moll has a voice of depth
and richness and he has added some effective bits of comedy to a
portrayal that already was very funny.
   Nico Castel took the speaking part of the Pasha. He creates the
happy ending after Osmin discovers the abduction attempt by
wandering around and sticking his arm through the plotters' ladder.

   Publisher Malcolm Forbes, who once
threw himself a Gatsby-like birthday party attended by nearly 1,000
guests, was carried from a church in a pine coffin after a funeral
attended only by immediate family.
   The funeral Monday at the tiny Church of St. John on the
Mountain included a bagpiper playing a mournful ``Scotland the
Brave.''
   Forbes, the balloonist, motorcyclist, lavish party-thrower and
owner of the business magazine that bears his family name, died of
a heart attack in his sleep Saturday at his 40-acre estate in
nearby Far Hills. He was 70.
   A public memorial service is planned for Thursday at a church in
New York City.
   Monday's service took place in the church his family had
attended since the late 1950s.
   His son Malcolm ``Steve'' Jr., who will succeed him as head of
the publishing empire, delivered the eulogy, said the Rev. Alfred
Niese, pastor of the Episcopal church.
   Also attending were Forbes' former wife, Roberta; daughter Moira
Mumma; his other sons, Robert, Christopher and Timothy, and eight
grandchildren.
   Following the 1\-hour ceremony, Forbes' flag-draped coffin was
carried to a hearse. His body is to be cremated and the ashes are
to be placed on the Fiji island of Lucala, owned by the Forbes
family.
   Forbes, whose worth has been estimated at $400 million to $1
billion, had made his last birthday, in August, his biggest.
   He spent $2 million on the party in Morocco. It featured 600
belly dancers, 200 Berber horsemen, pigeon pie served under tents,
and a guest list that included Elizabeth Taylor, Henry Kissinger,
Barbara Walters and Lee Iacocca.

   A 5-year-old lapsed into a coma after a
friend of his mother's handed him a bottle of bourbon and told him
to ``drink it like a man,'' police said.
   Anthony Jimerson, 21, of Forest Hills was jailed on $100,000
bail on charges of causing injury to a child. Police in suburban
Everman said Raymond Griffin was given the alcohol at a party
Friday night.
   ``The guy took the lid off the bottle, gave it to the kid and he
took a big swallow,'' said Sgt. Mark Bigler.
   Raymond, who weighs about 60 pounds, drank about 10 ounces of
bourbon _ roughly the equivalent of a fifth of alcohol for an
average adult, Bigler said.
   The boy was in critical condition Monday in a coma at Cook-Fort
Worth Children's Medical Center, where he was taken Saturday after
he went into convulsions, authorities said.
   At one point, the boy's blood-alcohol level was about .55
percent _ more than five times the legal limit for driving in many
states _ and he probably will suffer brain damage, the officer said.
   Jimerson had been invited to play dominoes at the home of
Raymond's mother, Patricia Griffin, 31, police said.

   University of Texas groundskeepers launched
a pyrotechnic assault that finally chased hundreds of cackling
grackles from the campus. But they ruffled some gubernatorial
feathers in the process.
   University officials had tried for five years to chase away the
grackles, small blackbirds that taunted students with their
cackling and soiled sidewalks with their plentiful droppings.
   For four straight nights this month, groundskeepers armed with
exploding Roman candle-type devices waged an all-out artillery
offensive, finally succeeding in shooing the birds off-campus.
   The birds headed south _ straight for the governor's mansion,
less than a mile away.
   They converged on the lawn in one big, mad squawking flock, as
if demanding an audience with Gov. Bill Clements himself. He was
not home.
   The staff immediately knew where the birds came from, and called
university officials, said Anne DeBois, the mansion's administrator.
   ``We don't want the grackles here,'' she said. ``They are
unwelcome tourists.''
   So the university sent their bird-bombers to the mansion to
drive the flock away.
   ``We're waiting to see whether they come back,'' said Howard
Wilson, university maintenance chief. ``But for the time being,
it's now a much nicer place.''

try to become the West Virginia University Mountaineers' mascot _
an 18th century frontiersman.
   ``I think when people first hear of a lady Mountaineer, they
think, `Oh, no.' But the reason I applied was not to prove any
point, but to show my enthusiasm,'' Tennant, the first woman
finalist for the position, said Monday.
   Tennant, 22, a broadcast journalism student from Fairview, is
competing against junior business student Doug McClung, 21, of
Waynesboro, Va.
   Mountain Honorary, a group of student leaders, on Thursday night
will announce which of the two will don the buckskin and carry the
muzzleloading rifle.
   Marilyn McClure, president of Mountain Honorary, said several
people called a radio talk show during the weekend to oppose a
frontierswoman mascot.
   But women's groups on campus have said it's a step forward that
a woman even felt she could apply for the job, McClure said.
   Gordon Thorn, adviser for Mountain Honorary, said the mascot's
gender makes no difference.
   ``The spirit is the thing. I'm sure the women had just as much
pioneer spirit as the men did to get through those days,'' Thorn
said.

   NASA set its sights on a sixth
attempt early Wednesday to launch space shuttle Atlantis on a
secret military mission, but the weather forecast still looked dim.
   Air Force forecasters said there was only a 40 percent chance
the weather would allow liftoff at 12:45 a.m. High winds and clouds
are expected to move into the launch area, and the outlook for
Thursday is about the same.
   The five delays in as many days have so far have cost NASA $2.75
million in fuel, labor and materials.
   Atlantis' mission is classified, but sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity said the shuttle is on a 4{-day mission to
put in orbit a $500 million satellite capable of taking detailed
photos and listening in on electronic communications over much of
the world.
   The latest postponement came early Monday. NASA kept the
spacecraft and crew poised for favorable conditions, but good
weather never developed, and the space agency decided to hold off
for 48 hours before trying again.
   ``It's going to give us all a chance to get some rest,'' said
NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
   Atlantis' commander, John O. Creighton, a Navy captain, led two
members of his five-man, all-military crew back to Houston on
Monday for tuneup training at the Johnson Space Center. They were
to return to the Kennedy Space Center today.
   Atlantis was delayed twice because of weather and Creighton's
sore throat and nasal congestion. Weather alone caused two other
delays and a failed computer was blamed for another. The first
attempt was last Thursday.
   A sixth delay will tie Atlantis for the number of launch
postponements experienced by two earlier missions. Columbia lifted
off Jan. 12, 1986 after six delays caused by weather and mechanical
problems. Challenger's ill-fated launch on Jan. 28, 1986 came after
six delays, three as a result of the Columbia postponements and
three that came during actual countdowns.
   With Creighton on the mission are Air Force Col. John H. Casper,
the pilot, and mission specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C.
Hilmers, Air Force Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Cmdr. Pierre J.
Thuot.
   Atlantis' flight will be the 34th shuttle mission and the sixth
classified military flight.

   Rocky Balboa is down but not out.
   A crew worked two hours with a diamond-tipped circular saw and
jackhammer to free the 8{-foot bronze likeness of the movie boxing
champ from the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art before
returning it to the Spectrum sports arena.
   But fans of the South Philadelphia palooka played by Sylvester
Stallone said Monday they will fight to return the 800-pound statue
to the stone stairway made famous in the original ``Rocky.''
   Museum President Robert Montgomery Scott has said the statue is
a movie prop, not art, and he doesn't want it in front of the
classical building.
   Among those working to keep the statue there is James Binns, a
lawyer and former boxing commissioner hired by Stallone. In Binns'
corner is Mayor W. Wilson Goode, who has come out in favor of the
statue as a tourist attraction.
   The city Art Commission said it will wait 60 days before
determining whether the statue of Rocky in boxing trunks, arms
raised in triumph, will be returned to the steps.
   The statue, which first appeared at the museum during the
shooting of ``Rocky III'' in 1981, was brought back from the
Spectrum for filming of ``Rocky V.''
   Filming ended Friday, clearing the way for the producers to
honor their contract to move the statue.
   ``I feel kind of bad,'' said Bret Carpin, one of the workers who
cut the figure from its concrete base. ``I hope he doesn't hold it
against us.''
   The museum was closed Monday as usual, but a crowd of TV camera
crews, photographers and curious museum employees circled the
statue.
   Before the movers arrived, more than 30 members of a high school
swim team from Jacksonville, Fla., came to see the statue while in
town for a swim meet. It was the first tourist site they saw, even
before the Liberty Bell.
   In the original ``Rocky,'' which won the Oscar for best picture
in 1976, Rocky runs up the stone steps in triumph while training
for a fight.
   The Los Angeles publicist for ``Rocky V,'' Dave Fulton, said of
the statue's fate, ``It's pretty much up to the people of
Philadelphia. It's out of our hands.''

<HEAD>Canceled Meeting Jeopardizes Season Openers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A canceled meeting between club owners and the
baseball players' union sent the spring training lockout into its
13th day today and dimmed the prospects of the season opening on
time.
   Union chief Donald Fehr canceled negotiations Monday with the
owners, who he said offered nothing new in a dispute that is mostly
over what year in their careers players can enter into salary
arbitration. Players want that right after two years instead of
three.
   Owners and players say a minimum of three weeks of spring
training and several days for players to travel to camps are needed
before the season can begin on time April 2. No new talks were
scheduled.
   ``The season is in very heavy jeopardy,'' Baseball Commissioner
Fay Vincent said Monday. He said he sympathized with fans who
endured a 50-day strike in 1981, and he called the standoff
``tragic to the point of absurdity.''
   Fourteen of the nation's governors sent a letter to Vincent on
Monday, calling the labor dispute ``a national disgrace.''
   ``Baseball is too important to our country _ both economically
and culturally _ to allow this to drag on,'' the letter said.
   Minimum salary, player benefits and team roster size are also at
issue.

<HEAD>Ortega Makes Gesture of Peace With Victorious Rival; Transition
Talks Begin</HEAD>

   Supporters of his victorious rival
cheered President Daniel Ortega at length as he entered the home of
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and embraced her, offering his help in
national reconciliation.
   ``There are neither winners nor losers here, Daniel,'' Mrs.
Chamorro told the man she defeated in a stunning electoral upset
the previous day.
   The short congratulatory visit was another statesmanlike gesture
from the 44-year-old revolutionary leader of this country torn by
civil war and partisan bitterness.
   Earlier Monday, Ortega conceded defeat in an eloquent,
impassioned television speech.
   He said his Sandinistas would honor the voters' wishes and,
after 10 years of one-party rule, surrender power to the fractious
6-month-old United Nationalist Opposition (UNO) alliance Mrs.
Chamorro led to victory.
   When Ortega visited Mrs. Chamorro accompanied by key
international observers including former President Jimmy Carter,
she greeted him warmly.
   ``Come here, my darling,'' she told Ortega. ``I love you very
much.''
   The post-election holiday was mostly quiet and transition talks
began between Sandinista and Uno leaders. There were, however,
brief clashes in the capital between inebriated Sandinista and
opposition militants.
   Ortega may have lost Sunday's peaceful election, but his
Sandinistas remain the country's largest party and control the
military as they go into transition talks with Mrs. Chamorro's
U.S.-backed coalition.
   He has promised to relinquish power to Mrs. Chamorro on April
25, when the 60-year-old publisher of the country's only opposition
newspaper is to be inaugurated for a six-year term.
   But he will become a member of the National Assembly, where
Sunday's elections put the Sandinistas in opposition.
   For a year after the 1979 revolution that toppled the corrupt
Somoza regime, Ortega had shared podiums with Mrs. Chamorro, whose
husband's assassination a year earlier helped ignite the Sandinista
revolution.
   But she became disillusioned with the leftist Sandinistas as
they turned repressive and dogmatic, and left the revolutionary
leadership.
   In 1981, with former President Reagan's blessing and support,
the Contra rebel insurgency was launched. U.S. trade sanctions
followed and before long the centrally planned, poorly managed
economy was in decline.
   Mrs. Chamorro, then, inherits a country wracked by inflation
with a huge trade imbalance and will surely be seeking substantial
U.S. aid.
   In Washington, there was elation and Bush adminstration
officials said lifting the U.S. economic embargo was under
discussion.
   President Bush called on both the Sandinistas and Contras to
exercise restraint: ``Given the clear mandate for peace and
democracy, there is no reason at all for further military activity
from any quarter.''
   With 82 per cent of the vote counted, Mrs. Chamorro was leading
Ortega by 633,357 votes, or 55.2 per cent, to 468,040 votes, or
40.8 per cent. The breakdown of 90 directly elected National
Assembly seats had not been announced, but Ortega was certain to
receive one of the special seats reserved for losing presidential
candidates who win more than 1 percent of the vote.
   On Monday, Sandinista and UNO leaders met with each other, with
Carter and other key international observers.
   ``We want to make sure there is a smooth transition of power,''
Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto said in an interview.
   Carter said that he, representatives of the United Nations and
the Organization of American States had agreed to stay and help
both parties during the transition period.
   One of the main points of the transition discussions is the role
of the army, closely identified with the Sandinistas and now a
strong, well-trained organization following years of warfare.
   The opposition coalition wants to reduce military spending and
abolish the draft, while the Sandinistas are opposed to a quick,
drastic reduction.
   In Managua on Monday night, several dozen drunken supporters of
both sides traded insults and clashed briefly in the streets. And
in the provincial capital of Leon, Sandinista activists occupied
opposition party headquarters for a time but left peacefully.
   The Managua confrontation developed into a drunken rock- and
bottle-throwing fracas that was broken up by riot police using tear
gas.
   Afterward, Mrs. Chamorro's campaign manager, Antonio Lacayo,
went into the street later told UNO supporters: ``I have a message
from Violeta, and it's that you should go home right now, and
peacefully.''
   All but a few of the more inebriated celebrants dispersed. One
man was cut in the head during the clash, reporters on the scene
said.
   For most international observers it was getaway day, and
senators, congressmen and other dignitaries hustled into buses to
head for the airport.
   At the Olof Palme Convention Center, saddened members of
international pro-Sandinista groups gathered in front of video
monitors to watch taped replays of Ortega's concession speech. In
the crowd in front of one monitor stood actor Ed Asner and singer
Jackson Browne.
   On Radio Sandino, the party station, callers expressed anger,
sorrow and determination to continue as a party.
   While one caller said Ortega shouldn't step down because the
election was fraudulent, most were far more poignant.
   ``Daniel, Daniel, we are still with you,'' said one tearful girl
from the nearby city of Masaya, the cradle of the Sandinista
revolution.
   Ortega had called the election and invited the international
observers that made Sunday's the freest balloting in Nicaraguan
history and perhaps the most closely monitored anywhere.
   After overthrowing dictator Anastasio Somoza, the Sandinistas
transformed the country into a revolutionary state, redistributing
wealth to poor peasants, improving the literacy rate and
nationalizing major industries.
   The Ortega government won strong support from the Soviet Union
and Cuba and was accused by the United States of trying to foment a
Communist revolution in neighboring El Salvador.
   But the embattled Sandinistas recently abandoned strident
socialism and, with economic support from the Soviet bloc
decreasing, sought closer ties with the United States.
   Their loss at the polls follows by just a few months the
restoration of democracy in much of the East bloc and moves toward
democratization in the Soviet Union itself.

   Important events in the decade the
Sandinistas have ruled Nicaragua:
   _ July 19, 1979: The Sandinista National Liberation Front enters
Managua, two days after dictator Anastasio Somoza had fled in
secret and begins its rule.
   _ April 1980: Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, whose husband was
assassinated in a killing that helped bring the Sandinistas to
power, quits the governing junta, claiming health problems. Mrs.
Chamorro, who succeeded her husband as publisher of the newspaper
La Prensa, would soon start criticizing the Sandinistas.
   _ November: First attacks by anti-Sandinistas who became known
as Contras, short for the Spanish word for counterrevolutionary.
   _ February 1981: The Reagan administration announces suspension
of aid to Nicaragua and accuses the Sandinista Front of aiding
leftist guerrillas in El Salvador.
   _ April 9, 1984: Nicaragua asks the World Court to order the
United States to stop helping the Contras. The Reagan
administration announces it won't accept the court's jurisdiction.
   _ Jan. 10, 1985: Daniel Ortega is inaugurated as president
following national elections.
   _ May 1: Reagan announces a trade embargo against Nicaragua.
   _ June 27: The World Court says U.S. support of the Contras
violates the U.N. charter's ban on use of force.
   _ Aug. 13: The U.S. Senate approves Reagan's request for a
military aid package for the Contras.
   _ Oct. 5, 1986: An American-manned cargo plane is shot down over
Nicaragua. Surviving crew member Eugene Hasenfus is captured and
implicates the CIA in Contra-supply operations. Hasenfus is
subsequently freed.
   _ Nov. 25: U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese says some of the
profits from the sale of American arms to Iran were secretly
diverted to the Contras in an operation under U.S. Marine Lt. Col.
Oliver North.
   _ Aug. 7, 1987: Five Central American presidents sign a regional
peace plan sponsored by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. He would
subsequently receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. The
plan called for amnesties for political prisoners, democratic
reforms, an end to foreign aid for irregular forces, and
prohibiting one country from allowing its territory to be used by
guerrillas to attack another country.
   _ Feb. 3, 1988: Congress cuts off military aid to the Contras
but continues non-lethal aid.
   _ March: Sandinistas and Contras meet for the first time in
face-to-face peace talks in the Nicaraguan border post of Sapoa.
   _ April 1: A formal 60-day truce begins.
   _ May 31: The Sandinistas decide to extend the cease-fire on a
month-to-month basis; the Contras say they consider the truce
indefinite. Fighting slackens.
   _ July 11: U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton is expelled from
Nicaragua along with eight other U.S. diplomats, accused of trying
to destabilize the Sandinista government. Washington retaliates by
expelling the Nicaraguan ambassador, Carlos Tunnerman, and eight
other diplomats.
   _ September: Contra-Sandinista talks break down, but thousands
of Contra guerrilla fighters are moving out of the Nicaraguan
hinterland into base camps in Honduras.
   _ Jan. 30, 1989: Ortega announces a tough austerity program to
combat world-record inflation that surpassed 33,600 percent in 1988.
   _ Feb. 14: Five Central American presidents sign an accord in El
Salvador. Ortega promises early elections in exchange for
dismantling the Contras, based in Honduran jungle camps.
   _ April 28: President Bush signs a $49 million non-lethal aid
package for the Contras. The package runs out Feb. 28, 1990.
   _ Aug. 7: Five Central American presidents meeting in Tela,
Honduras, sign an agreement to dismantle the Contras' bases in
Honduras by Dec. 8, 1989. They ask help from the United Nations and
the Organization of American States. The rebels are not signatories
to that pact, which says their demobilization must be ``voluntary.''
   The Bush administration wants the Contras to remain intact to
guarantee that elections set for Feb. 25, 1990, are free and fair.
   _ Aug. 26: Contra Commander Israel Galeano says the rebels will
ignore the Tela accord and U.S. advice and starts moving his troops
back to Nicaragua.
   _ Nov. 1: Ortega announces the lifting of the 19-month-old
cease-fire after several attacks and the infiltration of thousands
of Contra troops. Fighting surges briefly, but returns to the low
level it had reached earlier, after the U.S. cut off lethal aid.
   _ Nov. 27: Ortega refuses to deny Nicaragua's role in a shipment
of missiles found when a small plane crashes in El Salvador. The
United States and El Salvador accuse the Sandinistas of continuing
to help the Salvadoran guerrillas, who had launched their biggest
offensive Nov. 11.
   _ Dec. 12: Ortega and four Central American presidents issue a
communique calling for the demobilization of both the Salvadoran
guerrillas and the Contras.
   _ Sunday: Elections are held and Mrs. Chamorro's coalition
defeats Ortega.
   _ Monday: Ortega concedes, visits Mrs. Chamorro at her home and
promises to promote national reconciliation. Transition talks begin.

   A sheriff who seized a National Guard
armory to ease jail overcrowding is relying in part on a
300-year-old statute that compels others to help him keep the peace
_ or face four hours in the stocks.
   ``It sounds funny, people laugh about it now,'' county attorney
Edward McDonough said Monday. ``But I think people realize that the
emergency we faced in 1990 in Hampden County was something that was
unprecedented.''
   The issue arose Feb. 16 when Sheriff Michael Ashe seized the
armory, telling surprised guardsmen that lack of jail space posed
an imminent danger of a breach of the peace.
   On Friday, Ashe won the right to keep inmates at the armory
while county and state officials try to work out a compromise
location. A hearing on the matter was set March 12.
   Assistant Attorney General Lawrence Fletcher-Hill argued the
sheriff is a county official with no authority to take state
property.
   Ashe cited a law dating from the Massachusetts Bay Colony that
allows a sheriff to require assistance in carrying out his duties
with regard to criminals.
   Anyone refusing to help, if convicted before ``one or more of
his majestie's justices of the peace, such offender or offenders
shall be fined, to the use of the poor of the town where the
offence shall be committed, not exceeding forty shillings, at the
discretion of such justice or justices, acording to the
circumstances aggravating or lessening such offence,'' reads the
statute in the Acts and Resolves, Public and Private of the
Province of the Massachusetts Bay.
   Those unwilling to come up with the 40 shillings could spend 48
hours in prison or four hours in the stocks.
   McDonough said in addition to the old statute, the county also
is arguing that the sheriff's duty is to house convicted prisoners,
something his overcrowded jail wouldn't allow.

   Cornell Gunter, lead singer of The Coasters,
the comic do-wop group that had hits in the late '50s with ``Yakety
Yak'' and ``Charlie Brown,'' was shot to death while driving,
police said today. He was 53.
   Gunter was shot twice in the chest at an intersection at midday
Monday was found slumped over the steering wheel of the car, police
said.
   ``It appears he was shot through the windshield and he was dead
on the scene. We don't have a motive at this time,'' said Lt. Gary
Rainey.
   Gunter and The Coasters had been scheduled to perform at the
Lady Luck Hotel this weekend, said Janice Mazuroski, a spokeswoman
at the hotel.
   A tenor, Gunter joined The Coasters in 1957, two years after the
group was formed in Los Angeles.
   With a flurry of hits that included ``Yakety Yak'' in 1957 and
``Charlie Brown,'' ``Along Came Jones'' and ``Poison Ivy'' in 1959,
The Coasters were the nation's most popular black rock 'n roll
group at the end of the decade.
   Other hits included ``Framed,'' ``Idol with the Golden Head''
and ``Shoppin' for Clothes.''
   Their last chart appearance was in 1971 with ``Love Potion
No.9.''
   ``Yakety Yak'' contained the refrain, ``Yakety yak, don't talk
back,'' while ``Charlie Brown'' was known for line, ``Why's
everybody always pickin' on me?''
   With changes in personnel, Gunter kept the group on the concert
circuit, with the current ensemble known as Cornell Gunter and His
Coasters. Various band members headed separate groups in recent
years billed as The Coasters.
   Gunter was a native of Los Angeles. In 1987, he was inducted
into the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame.

   This country's rightist
government says it hopes the opposition victory in Nicaragua will
have a ripple effect in El Salvador and improve chances of ending a
leftist insurgency backed by Managua.
   ``I believe that now is when the Salvadoran democratic process
should open political spaces for the incorporation of the
guerrillas and seek social harmony,'' Armando Calderon Sol, head of
the governing Nationalist Republican Alliance Party, known as
Arena, said Monday.
   In Nicaragua, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of the United National
Opposition alliance on Sunday defeated President Daniel Ortega of
the Sandinistas, who have ruled since coming to power in a 1979
revolution and backed the Salvadoran rebels.
   ``With the upset of the Sandinistas, democracy in the region is
taking hold. There's no call to go on killing in El Salvador, and
we should facilitate dialogue,'' Calderon said.
   There was no immediate comment from the rebels, fighting the
right-wing Salvadoran government in a 10-year-old civil war that
has claimed 72,000 lives.
   The government, which broke diplomatic and commercial ties with
Nicaragua in November over arms shipments to the rebels,
congratulated Mrs. Chamorro in a statement issued by Deputy Foreign
Minister Ricardo Valdivieso.
   Chamorro's triumph ``opens broad hopes for Nicaragua's social
and economic development process and that of the whole Central
American region,'' Valdivieso said.
   Salvadoran opposition party spokesman Ruben Zamora also praised
Ortega's government for holding clean and free elections.
   The elections ``are an example of democracy,'' said Zamora, head
of the Popular Social Christian Movement party and the Democratic
Revolutionary Front. Zamora's party and the Democratic
Revolutionary Front are politically aligned with the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) guerrillas.
   Calderon, referring to rumors that Nicaragua has sent weapons to
the Salvadoran rebels, said the fall of Sandinista government means
``the FMLN is historically cut off.''
   Col. Mauricio Ernesto Vargas, military commander in four eastern
provinces of El Salvador, said, ``This means the FMLN will have to
change. They're going to lose the suupport they had from Nicaragua
for damaging the political economic and social system in El
Salvador,'' he said.
   ``Peace is closer with the change in Nicaragua,'' Vargas said in
a telephone interview with The Associated Press.

<TEXT>
   A court has sentenced to death a 46-year-old
gambling den operator after convicting him on charges of
trafficking in $1.61 million worth of heroin, news media reported
today.
   Tan Boon Tat was found guilty of transporting 2{ pounds of
heroin on May 10 1987, the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation
reported.
   Trial judges Yong Pung How and L.P. Thean, in sentencing Tan on
Monday, rejected his defense that he did not know the drug was in
the trunk of his car, the Straits Times daily reported.
   The court was told narcotics officers trailed him from his
gambling den to a coffee shop, from which he emerged with a plastic
bag. He was then trailed back to near his gambling den, stopped at
the entrance to a parking lot and arrested. Tan claimed the bag was
left in his car by a friend a few days before his arrest.
   Thirty-eight people have now been sentenced to death in
Singapore on drug trafficking charges under a 1975 law that allows
the death penalty in such case, the Central Narcotics Bureau said.
Of them, 26 have been hanged.

   A judge known for running an efficient court
has been picked to hear charges left over from the nation's longest
and costliest criminal trial, the McMartin preschool molestation
case.
   Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg replaces Judge William
Pounders, who presided over the trial of Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63,
and her son, Raymond, 31. The nearly three-year trial cost more
than $15 million.
   A jury in January acquitted the Buckeys on 53 child molestation
charges but deadlocked on 13 counts against the son. His retrial is
set for March 9.
   Gary Klausner, supervising judge of the Los Angeles Superior
Court's central criminal division, announced Weisberg's assignment
Monday.
   Klausner removed Pounders on the recommendation of Superior
Court Judge Michael Hoff, who ruled last week that Pounders'
post-trial TV appearances could hamper selection of a new jury.
   Weisberg, 47, spent 18 years as a Los Angeles County prosecutor.
He won a murder conviction in the slaying of Vicky Morgan, mistress
of business tycoon Alfred Bloomingdale.
   Weisberg, appointed to the bench two years ago by Gov. George
Deukmejian, has a reputation for moving cases along efficiently.
   He will meet with prosecutors and defense lawyers in a pretrial
hearing Wednesday.

   Newspaper heiress Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger,
whose powerful acquaintances included every president from Coolidge
to Kennedy and whose subtle but firm influence shaped The New York
Times, has died at age 97.
   Trustee of the family fortune and the daughter, wife,
mother-in-law and mother of Times publishers, Mrs. Sulzberger died
in her sleep of respiratory failure Monday at her home in Stamford,
Conn.
   She played an important role in selecting publishers of the
Times after her father, Adolph S. Ochs, acquired it in 1896, and
she worked to expand the paper's coverage of women's affairs and
its circulation in schools.
   ``You cannot think of Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger without thinking
of The New York Times. And it is impossible to imagine the Times
without Iphigene Sulzberger,'' wrote former Times editor Harrison
E. Salisbury in the introduction of her memoirs, ``Iphigene: My
Life and The New York Times.''
   She recalled meeting ``many interesting people'' as a child:
Mark Twain, Andrew Carnegie, President William Howard Taft, Adm.
Richard Byrd.
   As an adult, Mrs. Sulzberger traveled and rubbed elbows with the
famous: she met Eleanor Roosevelt, dined with Chiang Kai-shek and
sipped coffee with Golda Meir.
   She was a White House guest of every president from Calvin
Coolidge to John F. Kennedy and was acquainted with many heads of
state, including Japanese Emperor Hirohito, the Shah of Iran and
Winston Churchill.
   In ``The Kingdom and the Power,'' Gay Talese suggested that if
her father had permitted it, Mrs. Sulzberger ``might have become a
journalist, a crusading sort urging reform.''
   But she disagreed, saying a single course at the Columbia School
of Journalism represented ``the first and only time I aspired to
become a journalist.''
   ``People often think that I must have reached some profound
conclusions about life and that what I have to say is to be taken
very seriously,'' she said in her memoirs.
   Ochs appointed her to the Times board of directors in her 20s.
After he died in 1935, she was one of three trustees _ along with
her husband and then her son _ of the Ochs estate, which owns the
controlling interest in the paper.
   To perpetuate her father's dream, Mrs. Sulzberger's four
children and her grandchildren entered into agreements that will
continue family control of the Times indefinitely.
   Newspapers were the birthright of Iphigene Bertha Ochs, the
granddaughter of Rabbi Isaac M. Wise, founder of Judaism's Reform
movement.
   On Sept. 19, 1892 _ the night she was born in Cincinnati _ her
father, then publisher of The Chattanooga Times, was in New York
fighting to get smaller papers accepted in The Associated Press.
   In 1904, young Iphigene helped lay the cornerstone for the
Times' building at Times Square.
   Sometime later, her father, dismayed by Iphigene's fascination
with ``vulgar'' comics in competitor papers, started the Times'
first and last comic strip, ``The Roosevelt Bears.''
   Young Iphigene judged their adventures ``wordy and
uninteresting,'' and the bears became extinct after a year and a
half.
   Salisbury said her impish nature emerged in childhood and she
remained irrepressible as an adult.
   At age 9, she signed a thank-you note to President Theodore
Roosevelt ``love and kisses''; at 12, she was expelled for
``impertinence'' from Dr. Sachs' School for Girls; at 16, she
enjoyed the rides at Coney Island with Guglielmo Marconi, inventor
of the wireless.
   An economics major, she graduated from Barnard College an A
student despite having dyslexia, a learning disability unknown at
the time.
   She became engaged to Arthur Hays Sulzberger at a
romantic-looking park in Spartanburg, S.C., which ``turned out to
be the grounds of the local lunatic asylum,'' according to her
memoirs. They were married in 1917, completing their Washington
honeymoon with a White House meeting with President Woodrow Wilson.
   Her husband retired in 1961. Their son-in-law, Orvil E. Dryfoos,
held the publisher's post until his death in 1963. Their son,
Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, known as ``Punch,'' has been publisher
since then; their grandson Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. is deputy
publisher.
   Mrs. Sulzberger's other children are Marian Sulzberger Heiskell,
the widow of Orvil Dryfoos and wife of Andrew Heiskell, retired
chairman of Time Inc.; Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg, publisher of the
Chattanooga Times, and Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger, a New York doctor.
She had 13 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Wednesday at Temple Emanu-El.

   A man who was to testify against a drug gang
accused of murdering his live-in companion was himself slain this
month, apparently to keep him from taking the stand, it was
reported today.
   Unidentified investigators said a man in a ski mask killed John
Shelton in Queens with a rifle Feb. 7, The New York Times said.
   Shelton, 43, had witnessed the slayin in 1988 of Maxine
Peterson, 43, who was hit by one of more than 20 bullets fired as
she stood holding their baby in the kitchen of their home. He
called 911 for an ambulance. The baby was not hurt.
   Shelton was a potential witness in the trial of the alleged
killers, although prosecutors would not say whether they had
planned to put him on the stand.
   Officials would not say whether he had identified any of the
four defendants, whose trial opened on Monday.
   Michael Bethea, 18, was charged with murdering Sheldon.
Officials would say whom they suspect of having hired the killer,
the Times said.
   Ms. Peterson, a nurse, was killed in what officials said was a
drug-related dispute between the defendants and a group that
included a member of Ms. Peterson's family or a friend of someone
in the family.
   Two other witnesses in Queens have been murdered or menaced in
recent years.
   A 61-year-old woman was shot to death in 1987 after testifying
before a grand jury about a gun battle that took place outside the
car service where she worked.
   In another case, a man's home was firebombed twice after he
complained about drug dealers, and a rookie policeman was shot to
death in his patrol car while guarding the house.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition called today
for the suspension of the defense minister while the government
investigates charges a secret military unit murdered anti-apartheid
activists.
   The Democratic Party said Gen. Magnus Malan must be suspended
until a probe into the military's Civil Cooperation Bureau is
concluded. Justice would almost certainly be obstructed if Malan
remains in power during the investigation, the liberal party said
in a statement.
   ``The black reaction is going to be one of anger because blacks
see this as a case of government manipulating the truth,'' party
co-leader Denis Worrall said.
   Malan, defense mnister since 1981, has denied ordering any
killings or other criminal activity. There have been more than 60
unsolved killings of anti-apartheid activists in the past decade.
   In other developments, police said today that two black men were
killed in continued fighting between rival black factions near
Durban in Natal province.
   Scores of people have been killed in recent weeks in fighting in
the province and black leader Nelson Mandela, released this month
after 27 years in prison, appealed for peace at a rally in Natal on
Sunday.
   Police said violence was nevertheless continuing in the
province, with 18 people killed in clashes in the past three days.
   They said about 200 people had been left homeless after scores
of homes were burned in black townships near Durban in the fighting
between the United Democratic Front and the more conservative
Inkatha movement of the Zulu tribe,.
   Also today, Lawyers representing more than 300 political
prisoners on Robben Island near Cape Town said their clients would
stay on a hunger strike until the government releases them. The
prisoners, who began the strike Monday, are protesting a government
decision not to release political prisoners convicted of violent
crimes.
   ``They want to be unconditionally released. They are extremely
unhappy,'' lawyer Willie Hofmeyr told a news conference in Cape
Town.
   President F.W. de Klerk released some political prisoners
earlier this month as part of his effort to try and clear the way
for talks on ending white rule and sharing power with the black
majority.
   De Klerk has refused to release hundreds of anti-apartheid
activists convicted of violent offenses.
   The incoming black goverment in neighboring Namibia, a former
South African territory becoming independent at month's end,
denounced Malan today for claiming a slain white activist was an
agent of South Africa's military.
   Theo-Ben Gurirab, the new foreign minister, said Malan's
statement about Anton Lubowski was ``tantamount to an act of
cowardice ... to make these kind of allegations which cannot be
rebutted by Anton Lubowski.''
   Malan told parliament in Cape Town on Monday that all activities
of the Civilian Cooperation Bureau were being suspended pending a
government probe into charges it was involved in political killings.
   Malan also claimed Lubowski, a leading figure in the South-West
African Peoples Organization (SWAPO) that fought a 23-bush war for
Namibian independence, was a South African intelligence operative.
   South African police Brig. Floris Mostert has alleged in court
documents that he suspects the bureau was involved in the Sept. 12
killing of Lubowski, the highest-ranking white member of SWAPO.

   The dollar was mostly higher in early European
trading today. Gold prices fell.
   Traders said the dollar was likely to stay within a narrow range
in Europe until U.S. markets opened.
   Trading was thinned by carnival celebrations in much of West
Germany, dealers said. Banks in Duesseldorf were closed Monday, and
Frankfurt banks were scheduled to finish business around 8 a.m. EST
for a semi-official afternoon holiday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.38 yen to a closing 149.03 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 148.78 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.6903 West German marks, unchanged
   _1.4903 Swiss francs, up from 1.4865
   _5.7233 French francs, up from 5.7205
   _1.9058 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9023
   _1,250.50 Italian lire, up from 1,250.25
   _1.1955 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1975
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6871, compared with $1.6927 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $408.45 a troy ounce,
down from $411.75 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $408.80.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $408.75, down from $411.25 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.30 to close at a bid $407.85.
   Bullion dealers said gold prices were wedded to dollar prices,
with any rally in the U.S. currency expected to put downward
pressure on gold.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.18 a troy ounce, from
Monday's $5.23.

   A woman cancer patient who refused
chemical and radiation treatment because she was pregnant,
delivered an apparently healthy baby and now plans to beat the odds
again with her own diet program.
   ``I believe I don't have cancer any more,'' Linda Babcock said
Monday from her bed at St. Joseph Medical Center in this central
Illinois city.
   ``I feel so much better. I can breathe. I could tell it was
there before. It felt like something cutting off my air, taking my
life,'' she said.
   Mrs. Babcock gave birth Friday to a 5-pound 6-ounce boy, Jesse
Warren Babcock.
   ``She has defied the statistics so far and provided a very
viable child,'' her physician, Dr. Larry Webster, said Monday night.
   ``Basically, the cancer stayed pretty much the same since last
summer,'' Webster said. ``That's good.''
   Diagnosed in August with a type of inoperable lung cancer called
oat cell carcinoma, Mrs. Babcock lived on a diet of carrot juice,
organically grown vegetables and fruits, lots of purified water and
vitamin pills.
   She also relied on her strong faith in God, she said.
   ``Give God the credit,'' said Mrs. Babcock, who described
herself as in the 30s. ``He guided me, through people I met, books
I read.''
   Statistically, her condition is ``certainly guarded,'' said
Webster. ``The cancer is very malignant and carries a very low
survivability rate.''
   Although X-rays show the tumor and fluid caused by the disease
remain in her right lung, the possibility exists the disease is in
remission, he said.
   ``You certainly would have to think so on the history of the
disease in other people. Normally at the stage it was in her, it
would be fatal.''
   Webster said he will not try to talk her into a more traditional
therapy.
   ``We mention chemotherapy and radiation to her, but that's her
choice,'' he said. ``I'd have to say that I would leave it up to
her.''
   ``I'm confident of living, of beating the cancer,'' Mrs. Babcock
said. ``The baby saved me from death _ as I saved him.''

<TEXT>
   Parade floats and scantily clad
samba dancers revved up the city's marathon carnival, while the
government urged TV stations to be a bit more discreet about
broadcasting nude revelers.
   Justice Minister Saulo Ramos asked TV executives Monday not to
broadcast flagrant examples of nudity, but the more prevailing
attitude was expressed by Roberto Costa, an advertising agency
employee in Belo Horizonte.
   ``This helps us forget inflation, the foreign debt and all of
Brazil's problems,'' said Costa, who wore a glistening purple wig
and was dancing in the four-day pre-Lent festivities.
   In Rio, unofficial capital of carnival, 16 samba ``schools'' _
neighborhood groups from poor, predominantly black districts _ take
part in the marathon two-night parade that ends today, the last day
of carnival.
   The schools, each with as many as 5,000 costumed members and up
to 20 floats, sing and dance to a bone-shaking beat in the
``sambadrome,'' a parade ground surrounded by a 75,000-seat
grandstand that covers six city blocks in downtown Rio.
   Dancers clad in rhinestone bikinis shimmy and gyrate to the
pulsing beat. Two television networks carry the parade live,
focusing on nudity and rolling pelvises.
   In Brasilia, Justice Minister Ramos noted that the 1988
constitution abolished censorship but asked broadcasters to use
self-restraint.
   ``Censorship has ended and we don't have a law that punishes
abuses,'' he said. ``We appeal to the conscience of the networks to
respect the ethical values of the Brazilian family.''
   Revelers with money packed the popular private-club balls, where
clothing and inhibitions are shed as the night goes on. The steamy
scenes are too much even for the television networks, which stop
live coverage in the wee hours.
   Rich and poor packed the sambadrome side-by-side Monay, singing
along as each group passed. When the popular Portela school went by
at 7 a.m., thousands of spectators climbed down from the
grandstands and joined the procession.
   The only somber note came when a float struck a high-voltage
wire outside the parade ground and a man was killed.
   Each school writes its own samba for the parade and is awarded
points for lyrics, costumes, dancing and music. The themes this
year ranged from the discovery of Brazil to last December's
election, the first free, popular election of a president in 29
years.
   This year also brought a revival of street carnival in Rio, with
pickup samba bands and improvised costumes. In the downtown
financial district, a ``beermobile'' passed out free suds.
   Police reported 33 killings Saturday and Sunday in greater Rio,
fewer than the 57 of the previous weekend.
   Banks, stores and government offices are closed until Wednesday,
when Brazilians will begin straggling back to work.

   The U.S. Census Bureau hopes the memory of
contralto Marian Anderson's 1939 Washington concert, a civil rights
landmark, inspires record numbers of blacks to turn out in this
year's census.
   ``If they don't know now, they'll learn a little bit later that
it really pays to stand up and be counted,'' Miss Anderson said
Monday at a ceremony at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.
   She was presented with a birthday cake as the Census Bureau's
poster and television campaign was unveiled. Miss Anderson turns 88
today.
   ``You are the first living American ever in our 200 years to
become a symbol of the United States census,'' Census Director
Barbara Everitt Bryant told Miss Anderson, who retired 25 years ago.
   The poster shows Miss Anderson performing on the steps of the
Lincoln Memorial urging blacks to ``Lift Up Your Voice. Stand up
for who you are. Answer the census on April 1, 1990.''
   Considered a historic performance, Miss Anderson sang before a
crowd that included Eleanor Roosevelt at the Lincoln Memorial on
April 9, 1939, after she was barred from Constitution Hall by the
Daughters of the American Revolution.
   The organization later said the hall was already reserved. The
incident became a landmark in the fight against segregation.
   The census, taken every decade since 1790, determines
distribution of seats in the House of Representatives, how seats
are divided in state legislatures and how billions of dollars in
federal funds are spent.
   Bryant said in 1790 the U.S. Census counted 750,000 blacks, or
19 percent of the 3.9 million populace. Each black then was counted
as only three-fifths of a person, she said.
   Roland H. Moore, associate director of the U.S. Census, said the
1980 census skipped 6 percent of the black population.
   This year, the bureau expects to count 31 million blacks from
about 250 million Americans.

   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile
surrendered to police after he and six others were indicted today
on rebellion charges for alleged roles in December's failed bid to
oust President Corazon Aquino.
   The former defense minister _ one of Mrs. Aquino's most vocal
critics _ has denied any role in the bloody Dec. 1-9 coup attempt
and accused the government of fabricating charges to silence the
opposition.
   Enrile left the Senate chamber with agents of the National
Bureau of Investigation, who served him an arrest warrant charging
him harboring fugitives and with ``rebellion with murder'' _ for
which there is normally no bail.
   He was taken to bureau headquarters where he was booked and
fingerprinted. Enrile told reporters he would probably remain there
overnight then ask the Supreme Court to allow bail.
   Before surrendering, Enrile said: ``I know that those who are
accusing me will surely have their day, as I have my day today.''
   The others indicted today were former Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan, Cagayan provincial Gov. Rodolfo Aguinaldo,
retired Brig. Gen. Felix Brawner, retired Lt. Col. Billy Bibit,
businessman Rebecco Panlilio and his wife.
   Enrile was the most well-known figure charged so far in the
failed coup, the sixth and bloodiest attempt to unseat Mrs. Aquino
since she took office in the 1986 uprising that toppled the late
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Enrile led the February 1986 military mutiny that triggered the
``people power'' uprising Mrs. Aquino rode to power. But Mrs.
Aquino fired Enrile as defense minister in November of that year
after a failed coup by his followers.
   Charges against Enrile stem from statements by witnesses who
claimed they saw Honasan and about 100 rebels at the senator's home
on the first day of the coup attempt. Enrile claims he has not seen
Honasan since 1987.
   Hours after his indictment was announced, Enrile appeared at the
Senate and in a speech to his colleagues said: ``The regime of
President Corazon C. Aquino has marshaled all its forces in
fabricating charges against me in order to silence the voice of the
opposition in this chamber.''
   ``As I leave you today, I pledge to you that no jail or prison
shall stop me from trying my best to voice the grievances of the
Filipino people,'' he added. Supporters of the failed coup have
charged the Aquino goverment with mismanagement and corruption.
   Vice President Salvador Laurel arrived later at the bureau
headquarters and told reporters that if Enrile's arrest was an
attempt ``to stifle the opposition, this is not going to work.''
   ``The arrest of Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, the lone opposition
member of the Senate, is the heighth of intolerance of political
dissent which is the essence of a functioning democracy,'' Laurel
said. ``The attempt to simulate compliance with legal processes
merely heightens the hypocrisy of the act.''
   Laurel broke with Mrs. Aquino in 1987 and later organized the
opposition Nacionalista Party along with Enrile.
   In a speech Sunday marking her fourth anniversary in office,
Mrs. Aquino repeatedly denounced Enrile, who as Marcos' defense
minister ordered the arrest of thousands, including her
assassinated husband Benigno Jr., during martial law from 1972
until 1981.
   She thanked the public for ``protecting'' her from him.
   Aguinaldo, a former lieutenant colonel, was suspended as
governor for 60 days after telling a Manila radio station that he
was sending tanks and artillery to the capital to support the coup
attempt.
   Honasan, who has been dropped from the military rolls, led the
August 1987 mutiny against Mrs. Aquino and played a leading role in
last December's putsch. He was arrested in December 1987 but
escaped the following April.
   Brawner, former military commander for northern Luzon, had been
serving as a consultant to the Senate defense committee after he
retired from the armed forces last year. He was accused of giving
advice to the rebels during the coup attempt.
   Bibit, the security chief of the customs bureau, was accused of
ransacking the customs armory to get weapons and food for the
mutineers. He was arrested last month.
   Panlilio and his wife were reportedly seen at Enrile's house
with Honasan on the first day of the Decmeber coup attempt.

   A Marine corporal who won a reversal
of her court-martial on charges she was a lesbian won't be retried,
officials said.
   Barbara J. Baum will be given back pay and an honorable
discharge, the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday.
   She served more than seven months in the brig after her 1988
conviction.
   Maj. Gen. J.D. Lynch Jr. decided that ``in view of the time that
had elapsed ... and the additional expense to the government,''
Baum won't be retried, the statement said.
   Ms. Baum, 25, of Lakewood, Fla., will be paid until she is
discharged _ probably in early March, Marine spokesman Capt. J.R.
Mill said.
   ``Obviously we're pleased,'' said Brendan Collins, an attorney
for Ms. Baum. ``We see it as a vindication.''
   Baum's conviction was overturned Feb. 15 by the Court of
Military Review in Washington, which ruled that two of jurors at
Ms. Baum's court-martial were biased and that the military judge
allowed uncorroborated testimony.
   One of the jurors had shown an interest in the case before the
court-martial and the other had outside knowledge of the case.
   Ms. Baum was the first of five women charged in a 1988 crackdown
on lesbians at the Parris Island Recruit Depot. She was convicted
of conspiracy to obstruct justice, obstruction of justice, indecent
acts and sodomy.
   She also received a dishonorable discharge, had her rank reduced
to private and lost all pay and allowances.
   Lance Cpl. Diana Maldonado _ the woman accused of having sex
with Ms. Baum _testified against her at the court-martial. The
appeals panel found the lack of independent corroboration rendered
Ms. Maldonado's testimony ``insufficient as a matter of law.''
   The Defense Department's official policy says ``homosexuality is
incompatible with military service.''

<HEAD>Israel and Poland Resume Diplomatic Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland and Israel resumed full diplomatic
ties today after a 23-year break, making this country once a
vibrant center of Jewish life the third Warsaw Pact nation to
resume relations with Israel in the past year.
   Relations were sealed with the signing of a protocal by Foreign
Ministers Moshe Arens of Israel and Krzysztof Skubiszewski of
Poland.
   Poland, like the entire Soviet bloc except Romania, followed
Moscow's lead and broke with Israel in 1967 to support the Arab
side in the Middle East War. It joins Hungary and Czechoslovakia in
renewing ties with the Jewish state.
   Poland has had low-level ties with Israel since 1987 and the
Solidarity-led government that came to power in August is hoping
the restoration of a formal embassy will lead to closer economic
and cultural cooperation.
   Poland's Jewish community was 3.5 million strong before World
War II, the Holocaust and massive emigration including a wave
prompted by a 1968 purge. Today, it numbers just 10,000.
   From 350,000 to 500,000 Israelis were born in Poland, including
the first Israeli prime minister, David Ben Gurion, and the present
one, Yitzhak Shamir.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki looked on during the protocol
signing at a government palace, and the Polish and Israeli
delegations sipped champagne afterward to celebrate the
long-awaited event.
   Arens said Israel hopes for Polish support for Israeli positions
in the Middle East peace process and for ``very extensive economic
relations. ... That will be of benefit to both countries.''
   The first day of Aren's visit Monday was spent in emotional
visits.
   He went to a Jewish cemetery and paid homage at the monument to
the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943, when Jews, held in a walled-in
section of the city and facing starvation, murder and deportation,
rose up against the Nazi occupiers.
   Polish press coverage of the Arens visit has focused on the
government's acknowledging the error of the decision to sever ties
and that act's consequences, including an anti-Semitic purge in
1968.
   ``Poland Apologizes to Israel'' and ``Return to Normalcy'' were
among newspaper headlines Monday.
   Skubiszewski said he agrees with the need for an apology and
said that Jews who left Poland after the 1968 purge are free to
come back and recover Polish citizenship. In addition, those harmed
can seek damages, he said.
   Arens is to go Wednesday to the Auschwitz death camp in southern
Poland, where the presence of a Roman Catholic convent in a former
Nazi warehouse strained Jewish-Polish relations and stirred
international controversy.
   Skubiszewski said the topic of the convent was discussed with
Arens on today, with Poland underlining support for the
construction of an alternate home for the nuns. Ground was broken
last week on an interfaith prayer center that is to include a new
convent for the nuns.

   Europe's second big storm of the year raged on
with high winds today after leaving roads and railways blocked,
power out and homes flooded in seven countries. Police said 38
people were killed.
   In Ireland, residents had more than wild weather to worry about
during the storm Monday, when winds gusted to as high as 120 mph.
Four circus tigers escaped when their cage was blown over near
Drogheda, and they roamed free until they were rounded up.
   For a second day, shipping in the English Channel and the Irish
Sea was badly disrupted by the strong winds.
   The Meteorological Office reported winds of more than 120 mph
over Belfast on Monday, the highest ever recorded in Northern
Ireland. Wind speeds neared or topped 100 mph in northern England
and southern Scotland, the office said.
   Fourteen deaths were reported in Britain, eight in France, seven
in West Germany, five in Belgium, two in East Germany and one each
in Ireland and the Netherlands.
   A storm that hit the northern continent on Jan. 25, packing 106
mph winds, claimed the lives of 95 people.
   In Britain, Monday's victims included a driver whose bus hit a
fallen tree, a man killed by a collapsing chimney and a woman hit
by a roof slate.
   In the North Wales neighboring seaside towns of Towyn and Kinmel
Bay, police and rescue workers evacuated 2,000 people from their
homes after waves opened up a hole 200 yards wide in the sea wall.
Water 5 feet deep in places poured through streets, flooded homes
and cut power and telephone links.
   The Assistant Chief Constable of North Wales, John Owen, said
high tides during the rest of this week mean those staying in
emergency shelters should prepare for a stay of several days.
   Homes bordering the Bristol Channel in western England were
flooded, many roads and railroad tracks were blocked by fallen
trees, and more than 125,000 homes in the Thames Valley near
London, in South Wales, in east and southwest England and in
Northern Ireland were without power today.
   In West Germany's northern port city of Hamburg, a woman was
killed when a gust pushed her in front of a car, a woman and her
two children were injured when a large billboard fell on them, and
a crane was blown over, damaging dock buildings.
   Another crane was blown over at Neu Isenburg near Frankfurt in
central Hesse state, killing the operator.
   The storm spoiled West Germany's Rose Monday pre-Lent carnival,
when crowds traditionally parade through city streets in fancy
dress accompanied by decorated floats.
   Strong winds wrecked 12 floats in Duesseldorf, Bonn's parade was
canceled and in Mainz 250,000 peole _ 100,000 fewer than expected _
paraded in rain-soaked carnival costumes.
   The dead in France included a 3-year-old girl killed by a
falling branch in Avesnes-sur-Helpes in the north of the country.
In Paris, a man was killed by a falling wall and a 17-year-old was
killed by a slamming door.
   In the Belgian port of Antwerp, a boat sank after a 15-ton crane
dropped onto the vessel, injuring several people. All ships
remained in port in Belgium's North Sea harbors on Monday and train
traffic to the Netherlands was interrupted.
   At Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, the Netherlands' flag carrier
KLM said it suspended 15 international flights on Monday. Seven
people were hurt at a pre-Lent carnival in the southern town of
Beek when a big tent blew down.
   Storm damage to overhead power lines halted Netherlands' rail
traffic on three local lines and the international link with
Belgium, the government-owned railroad company said. Two bridges
linking the southern and northern parts of the country were closed
because of storm danger, police said.
   The British government's Meteorological Office responsible for
weather forecasting said there was nothing abnormal about the
storms.
   ``There have been 10 comparable periods of destructive gales
recorded over the past 38 years,'' it said in a statement.
   It said Monday's storm originated off the eastern seaboard of
the United States when cold air from the Arctic collided with
warmer moist air from the south.

   Japan said today it welcomed Nicaragua's first free
elections and offered to help the country rebuild its shattered
economy.
   The Foreign Ministry did not say how much money Japan was
prepared to spend but said it is ``determined to make as much
contribution as possible in this regard.''
   A ministry statement said Japan hopes all factions in Nicaragua
will accept the results of Sunday's election, in which opposition
leader Violeta Barrios de Chamorro defeated Sandinista President
Daniel Ortega.
   The statement said it hopes Nicaragua's new president, who takes
office April 25, will work for democratization and improved living
standards.
   Ten years of Sandinista rule in Nicaragua has left an economy
wracked by inflation and mismanagement. A war with the U.S.-backed
Contra rebels and a U.S. embargo also took their toll.
   The ministry statement said it hopes the international community
``will join in rehabilitating the economy of Nicaragua and the
other countries in the region and solving refugee problems.''
   Japan has the world's largest budget for non-military foreign
aid, about $10 billion a year.

   Thousands of Nicaraguan exiles clogged
the main street of the community nicknamed Little Managua to
celebrate the upset defeat of their homeland's Sandinista regime,
proclaiming ``miracles do happen.''
   But their jubilation was tempered by concern about how victor
Violeta Barrios de Chamorra will cope with daunting problems facing
Nicaragua.
   Police estimated 8,000 Nicaraguans and other Hispanics converged
Monday on Sweetwater, a town west of Miami that is home to southern
Florida's largest Nicaraguan community, after the defeat of
President Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua's national elections.
   ``We never dreamed about it,'' said an exultant Francisco
Ortega, president of the Nicaraguan American Chamber of Commerce in
Dade County. ``We thought it was impossible. But see, miracles do
happen.''
   Nicaraguan exiles, many of whom had not slept since voting began
Sunday morning, jammed busy Flagler Street. Some waved flags,
danced and sang patriotic songs. Others sat in cars and blared
horns.
   The crowd swelled in the evening as the work day ended, and
police closed a five-block stretch to traffic.
   While many exiles talked of returning to Nicaragua, they said
they wanted to see the new U.S.-backed government in action first.
   ``Democracy is on its way back,'' said Inez de Gutierrez, a
31-year-old grocery store cashier who has been in the United States
for a year with her husband and young daughter. But she said she
would not return immediately.
   ``We'll just wait a while and see how things go in Nicaragua,
politically and economically. The country is in ruins. It's in
great poverty, now.''
   Renato Salazar said he will not be ready to return until the
Sandinistas, the left-wing revolutionaries who took power in 1979,
relinquish control of the military and police.
   ``Democracy means total democracy, not the government being in
charge of one part and the opposition in control of the army,'' he
said.
   At a shelter for Central Americans near the border city of
Brownsville, Texas, Edgar Toruno Raudales expressed the same
reservations.
   ``What good is it to have Violeta in power if the army controls
the country?'' he said. ``There could be a coup at any time.''
   ``This is what all the Nicaraguans wanted, the victory of
Violeta,'' said Jose Alfredo Velasquez.
   But Rosaria Baldeoceda, a 23-year-old student from Managua, was
more skeptical. ``No matter who is selected, we will have the same
mess,'' she said at the shelter in Texas.
   More than 100,000 Nicaraguans have settled in southern Florida
since the Sandinista revolution, and Sweetwater Mayor Jose A.
Rivero said many of them may have to return because they lack
permanent status in the United States.
   Adolfo Calero, former director of the U.S.-backed Contra rebels
who fought the Sandinistas, predicted that ``slowly, the Nicaraguan
exiles will go back to the country.''
   ``I'm going back as soon as I get a passport from the country,''
Calero said. ``I think the armed struggle is over. The armed
struggle was never an end in itself, it was always a means to force
the Sandinistas into a political contest which the people won,
headed by Violeta Chamorro.''
   Luis Munoz, who joined in the celebration, said he hoped the
government also changes in his homeland of Cuba, which he left as a
teen-ager.
   ``I know it's going to happen one of these days,'' said the
27-year-old. He said he wanted to return to Cuba because ``I belong
there.''

   A group of Vietnamese boat people returned
voluntarily to their Communist homeland today, the 12th group to do
so since the program began early last year.
   The group of 115 Vietnamese brought to 1,284 the number who have
returned under the U.N. program. Nearly 1,600 more have asked to
leave the overcrowded detention centers of Hong Kong and go home.
   About 44,000 Vietnamese have arrived in this British colony
since June 1988, when the government decided to classify arriving
boat people as illegal immigrants unless they can prove they fled
persecution.
   Only about 10 percent will be granted refugee status. The rest
face repatriation against their will, unless they volunteer to go
home.
   The United Nations provides Vietnamese who return voluntarily
with up to $50 in cash and a monthly allowance of $30 for one year.
   The voluntary repatriation program is expected to speed up now
that Hanoi has agreed to accept 1,000 returning boat people each
month.
   The repatriation of boat people against their will remains on
hold after an initial departure of 51 Vietnamese in December. Hanoi
has expressed reservations about the program because of criticism
from the United States and human rights organizations.

   Doctors say 12-year-old Stormie Jones, the
world's first heart-liver transplant recipient, is regaining her
strength quickly after undergoing a second liver transplant.
   Stormie was moved from the intensive care unit at Children's
Hospital of Pittsburgh to a regular room after being upgraded from
critical but stable condition to serious condition Monday
afternoon. She remained in serious condition early today.
   Stormie, who lives in the Fort Worth, Texas, suburb of White
Settlement, received her second liver transplant Feb. 20 in a
10-hour operation. She returned to the operating room the next day,
when doctors operated for nine hours to halt internal bleeding.
   Stormie's first transplant, in 1984 at Children's, was needed to
control effects of a rare disease that left her cholesterol levels
10 times greater than normal. The second operation resulted from
permanent liver damage caused by hepatitis.
   Despite her liver problems, Stormie's donor heart has remained
healthy, doctors said.

<HEAD>Durable Goods Orders in Record Plunge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods
plunged 10.5 percent in January, the biggest decline since orders
first were tracked 32 years ago, the government reported today. A
drop in aircraft orders led the way.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods _
big-ticket items expected to last more than three years _ totaled a
seasonally adjusted $118.2 billion last month after increasing a
revised 1.4 percent in December. That figure originally was
reported to be up 2.5 percent.
   The steepest decline until January's record was a 9.2 percent
fall in February 1982.
   `Most of the decline was in transportation equipment,'' the
department said. ``Aircraft and parts, which had been unusually
high in the last several months, accounted for nearly half of the
January decline in transportation, although motor vehicles and
parts and shipbuilding and tanks were both down sharply.''
   Aircraft orders represented one-third of the overall decline.
Auto production also fell in January as tens of thousands of auto
workers were laid off to help the industry shrink swollen
inventories. The department considers car orders and production to
be the same.
   The drop helped pull overall transportation orders down 27.6
percent to $27.9 billion.
   Much of the economy's recent weakness has been concentrated in
durable goods as the Federal Reserve sought for more than a year to
drive down inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit. The result
has been higher interest rates, which adversely affect durable
goods orders because they often are financed by loans.
   Excluding the transportation industry, orders fell 3.4 percent.
   The closely watched non-defense capital goods sector, often a
barometer of business investment plans, fell 13.7 percent,
reversing December's 14.2 percent gain. The sector also posted
gains in October and November.
   Electrical machinery orders dropped 17.6 percent to $18.8
billion after rising 5.6 percent in December and 7.3 percent in
November. Virtually all of the decrease was in communications
equipment, the Commerce Department said.
   Orders for non-electrical machinery, including computers and a
wide variety of industrial equipment, rose 2.6 percent to $22.3
billion after falling 3.9 percent in December.
   Primary metals orders were up 1.5 percent to $11.1 billion
following a 2.8 percent decline in December.
   New orders for defense capital goods, a highly volatile sector,
plummeted 36 percent to $6.3 billion for the lowest one-month
volume of orders since January 1987. Defense orders had slipped
12.9 percent in December after rising 17.7 percent in November.
Excluding defense, orders would have been off 3.4 percent.
   Shipments of durable goods in January dropped 3.7 percent to
$117.7 billion after falling 0.8 percent a month earlier.

   The fire filled the seventh floor with smoke and, through a

accountant and president of the tenants association at the
45-story, tinted-glass apartment building on the fashionable east
side of Manhattan.
   Delit used money from the account to pay his rent and gambling
debts, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Monday. A
pizza parlor he owns also may have been bought with the money, the
prosecutor said.
   Delit organized a rent strike among some of the tenants who,
while paying rents of $1,750 to $5,000 a month, complained of
problems with the building's elevators and air-conditioning,
cockroach infestations and water leaks.
   ``When you live in a building and you pay 100 percent rent, you
expect 100 percent services,'' he said two years ago.
   The tenants won a court order in September 1988 allowing them to
pay rents into an bank escrow account set up by Delit, instead of
to the landlord, until the building's alleged problems were fixed.
   But the escrow account never was opened, investigators now say.
The money paid by 40 to 60 tenants was deposited instead into an
account over which Delit had sole authority.
   Morgenthau said the tenants probably still have to pay the 27
months of rent. The bill could reach tens of thousands of dollars
for some tenants.
   Delit has been charged with first-degree grand larceny on
charges of stealing $1.71 million, Morgenthau said. If convicted,
he faces up to 25 years in prison.
   He left $213,000 in the account, which held more than $1.9
million, Morgenthau said. An additional $573,000 has been found in
a brokerage account, and $400,000 has been frozen in other
accounts, Morgenthau said.
   Dominick Franklin, a doorman at the building, did have something
nice to say about Delit. ``As a tipper, he was one of the best,''
Franklin said.

   The Soviet Union recognizes the results of the
Nicaraguan elections as legitimate and is prepared to negotiate
with the government of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro about future
relations, a Foreign Ministry official said today.
   ``The Soviet Union has more than once expressed its willingness
to respect the results of just and free elections in Nicaragua,''
said Ion Bourliai, the Foreign Ministry's deputy chief for Latin
America. ``Today, we are confirming this position.''
   In voting Sunday, Mrs. Chamorro defeated leftist President
Daniel Ortega, whose Sandinista party has ruled Nicaragua for a
decade.
   Bourliai told a news conference the Soviet Union would continue
to give non-military aid to Nicaragua if the new government wants
it, and also was prepared to negotiate future trade and military
cooperation.
   ``The two sides have concrete obligations,'' he said. ``The
Soviet Union is prepared to meet its obligations if the Nicaraguan
side will follow suit.''
   ``We are ready to discuss with the Nicaraguan government the
question of cooperation in the military field if necessary,''
Bourliai said.
   The Soviet Union cut off military supplies to Nicaragua after
1988, but still provides over $324 million in goods, Bourliai said.
An additional 25 tons of wheat and rice are given to Nicaragua
annually, he said.

   Blacks disrupted a City Council meeting and
forced a recess after the white-majority council voted 5-4 along
racial lines not to repave Martin Luther King Jr. Street.
   Councilman Lorenzo Harrison asked council to spend $17,000 to
pave the street in his district for this weekend's 25th anniversary
celebration of the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march.
   Councilman Bill King said repaving the street would be a
conciliatory gesture by the white councilmen to the black
community. ``We've spent millions of dollars illogically, so we
might as well spend $17,000 on this,'' he said.
   White councilman argued that other streets in the city were in
worse shape.
   At Monday night's meeting, some of the blacks in the audience
exchanged words with city leaders, including Mayor Joe Smitherman,
telling them to ``shut up'' and ``sit down.''
   Council President Carl Morgan ordered a recess because, he said,
the crowd became too unruly for the council to conduct business.
   The city has been the scene of racial turmoil since December
when the six whites on the 11-member school board voted against
renewing the contract of Norward Roussell, the city's first black
school superintendent.
   Demonstrators staged sit-ins at the high school and city hall
before the school board agreed to allow the superintendent to
remain in his job until his contract expires in June.

   The victory of Violeta Chamorro in Nicaragua
adds a new country to the world lineup of democracies, but also
adds to the U.S. dilemma as it tries to squeeze more eligible
nations into a limited foreign aid budget.
   ``Nobody said democracy was cheap,'' said Rep. Dante Fascell,
D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Fascell declined to say how much the United States must spend to
get Mrs. Chamorro's new government, to take office in April, a
running start despite an economy in shambles and a shaky political
coalition.
   But Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., said the United States should
contribute up to $300 million to an international fund that would
raise $1 billion to help restore the nation's economic health.
   ``It will take big bucks,'' agreed Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan. ``She needs our help and she deserves it.''
   Others cautioned, however, that with a growing line of potential
new foreign aid recipients _ Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia,
Panama and others _ it would be difficult to promise new money when
the budget already is falling short.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., said his reaction to the news of
Chamorro's win over leftist Sandinista President Daniel Ortega was
``astonishment. ... It's happening from one end of the world to the
other, the tyrants are being swept out.''
   But any euphoria was dampened by financial reality, he said. No
attempt to pour more money into foreign aid will find many
supporters because voters tend to see it as ``building roads over
there instead of building roads here,'' Edwards said.
   ``It's not realistic to expect the result of all this is going
to be a tripling of foreign aid,'' he said. ``The American people
aren't going to support it.''
   This year, the United States will send about $9.8 billion in
military, economic and development aid to several dozen friendly
countries around the globe. The lion's share, $5.1 billion, goes to
Israel and Egypt as a reward for entering into the Camp David peace
process. The Bush administration has asked for a slight increase,
to $10.1 billion, for 1991.
   Those amounts do not include a new three-year assistance program
approved last year for Poland and Hungary. Lawmakers already are
talking about adding more money to that program to include
countries like Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Romania.
   In addition, President Bush is asking Congress for $500 million
in new cash to help repair economic damage done to Panama by U.S.
trade sanctions, and physical damage done by December's invasion.
   The aid squeeze prompted one U.S. foreign aid official to joke
that he was ``a closet Sandinista'' because a Chamorro win would
put even greater strains on the aid program.
   Solarz and others, mostly Democrats, believe the money for new
democracies should be taken out of the Defense Department's $300
billion annual budget, reasoning that in a time of diminishing
communist threat it would be better spent to shore up potential new
allies.
   Dole took a different approach, using Chamorro's win over Ortega
to renew his proposal to alter the nation's foreign aid priorities,
beginning with the two largest recipients, Israel and Egypt.
   ``The only way we're going to pay for new aid to Nicaragua,
Panama, Czechoslovakia _ is to look to the foreign aid budget that
now exists, and make some tough calls,'' he said in a Senate floor
speech.
   Dole so far has found few supporters for his idea, and House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley cautioned that Nicaragua should not
automatically be given priority over current recipients of U.S.
aid. Foley singled out Jamaica, a country that saw its 1990 overall
aid check cut from $46 million to $19 million, despite close
cooperation in the U.S. war on drugs.
   But the consensus was that the money will have to be found
somewhere.
   ``We spent a great deal of money on military aid'' to the
anti-Sandinista Contra rebels, Foley said. ``We now should support
democracy ... We need to understand that the United States should
not be withdrawing from international affairs.''

   Senate and White House negotiators moved
closer to accord on a clean air bill today, but Majority Leader
George Mitchell says Senate floor debate will begin later this week
whether an agreement is reached or not.
   ``We are making progress,'' Mitchell said as closed-door
discussions resumed Monday and continued past midnight. But he
added, ``We started the talks three weeks ago and at some point we
need to reach a conclusion.''
   The talks in a crowded room adjacent to Mitchell's office in the
Capitol did not break until past 3 a.m. with no overall agreement
reached. Discussions were to resume today, according to Senate
sources.
   Sources close to the talks said early today that Democrats and
the Bush adminstration agreed on tougher controls on toxic
chemicals and smog-causing pollutants from industrial plants but
remained divided on acid rain curbs.
   The talks also moved closer to agreement on reducing automobile
emissions with the Bush administration for the first time agreeing
to a second round of tougher emission controls after the turn of
the century under some circumstances.
   The two sides agreed a so-called second stage of tailpipe
controls would go into effect nationwide if a certain number of
cities with the worst smog problems failed to achieve federal air
quality standards by a specific year, according to sources.
   The White House had argued earlier that a second round of auto
emission controls would be too expensive.
   Mitchell met Monday with White House chief of staff John Sununu
and William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Sununu agreed progress was being made, but he expressed concern
that bringing the measure to the Senate floor without agreement
with the administration might threaten key parts of the bill,
including the tough provisions on acid rain.
   The legislation would be the first revision of the federal clean
air law in 13 years. It would require tougher controls on acid rain
pollutants from electric power plants, curbs on toxic chemical
releases by industry and reductions in smog-causing emissions from
automobiles.
   Among the sticking points were how to ease some of the concerns,
especially from a group of Midwest senators, over controls of acid
rain pollutants from coal-fired electric power plants.
   Mitchell, who has made the clean air bill one of his top
priorities, told participants he intends to bring the measure to
the Senate floor Thursday whether or not there was an agreement
with the White House.
   The Senate bill and administration proposals agree on a call for
cutting sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons a year by the
end of the decade.
   More than a dozen senators, primarily from the Midwest, have
threatened to filibuster unless some sort of cost-sharing provision
is included to blunt the expenses many Midwest utilities will face
from having to install new acid rain control equipment.
   Mitchell bristled at Sununu's suggestion that bringing the
measure to the Senate floor might cause it to be weakened.
   ``It is the administration that has insisted on changing the
bill,'' Mitchell said. ``Every single (weakening) concession that
has been made ... has been made at the insistence of the
administration, every single one.''

   A shuttle in orbit is a rugged,
durable spaceship, but a shuttle on the ground is a weather wimp
that demands clear, dry, mild and still air before leaving its
Florida nest.
   When NASA abandoned an attempt to launch Atlantis early Monday,
it marked the 13th time in 34 missions that space shuttles had to
stay home because of weather. The failed attempt Monday was the
fifth postponement in five days for Atlantis; weather was a factor
in all but one case.
   Weather played a role, too, in the worst U.S. space disaster,
the Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986 that killed seven
astronauts.
   The shuttle is finicky about the weather because it has to be.
   Weather forces that might be only minor problems for
conventional aircraft can tear the shuttle apart.
   Winds as light as 23 mph _ just a spirited breeze for a sailboat
_ can smash a shuttle against its launch tower during takeoff. This
was one of the weather threats that blocked Monday's attempt to
launch Atlantis.
   Bumpy air aloft that might cause an airline pilot to turn on the
seatbelt sign can be enough to tear off the wing of a shuttle
rising through the atmosphere at three times the speed of sound.
   High-altitude winds of about 100 mph from the wrong direction
can threaten the shuttle but would be nothing of significance for
an airliner.
   Clouds that are only mildly annoying to even small planes can be
killers for the shuttle.
   Because the spacecraft returns to Earth as a powerless glider,
astronauts on the shuttle have only one chance to make a runway
landing. Thus, even before the shuttle is launched, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration has to make sure clouds don't
obscure the visibility at emergency landing sites.
   This was another of the problems that stopped Atlantis' launch
Monday. A bank of clouds at 5,000 feet blocked a clear shot at the
Kennedy Space Center emergency landing strip.
   Space shuttles are also supersensitive to water. Raindrops that
patter meekly against the window of a house become like buckshot
against a shuttle traveling at hyperspeeds. Thus, any precipitation
at the launch pad or in the flight path is enough to keep the craft
grounded.
   Even the mild temperatures of Florida can stop the shuttle's
show. If temperatures average less than 41 degrees for 24 hours
before a launch, NASA must wait for warmer weather.
   Once the shuttle fuel tank is filled with a half-million gallons
of propellant, a temperature rise above 99 degrees or a drop below
37 is enough to call off a launch.
   Challenger was exposed to hours of freezing temperatures before
its ill-fated launch in 1986. An investigation said the cold caused
the failure of a rubber O-ring in a solid rocket joint.
   The shuttles' finicky-weather rules fill a thick volume and are
enforced by an army of forecasters and observers who monitor every
gust of wind and drop of rain for miles around the launch pad and
the emergency landing sites.
   NASA tries again to launch Atlantis on Wednesday, and
forecasters said today that prospects for good weather by that time
were looking up. On Monday, they pegged the odds that the weather
would be acceptable at 40 percent; this morning, that figure rose
to 60 percent.

   Costumed revelers danced from bar to bar at
the break of dawn today and parade clubs set out in an early
kickoff of Mardi Gras, the bawdy, boozy blowout of pre-Lent
parades, street parties and carousing.
   ``I think we're going to make it,'' grinned jazz clarinetist
Pete Fountain as his Half-Fast Marching Club strutted toward the
French Quarter to the tune of ``Way Down Yonder In New Orleans.''
   ``This is our 29th year,'' Fountain said. ``Last year it was so
cold, I got to Bourbon Street and quit.''
   The weather was glorious this year _ 58 degrees at 8 a.m. and
warming, with not a cloud in sight. Long before the Rex and Zulu
parades rolled, crowds jammed the uptown parade routes and staked
out their positions with ladders and lawn chairs.
   Non-stop partying began over the weekend with the arrival of
thousands of visitors for the first of dozens of parades throughout
metropolitan New Orleans.
   On the side streets, neighborhood marching clubs hopped from bar
to bar.
   ``It's party time!'' shouted Jerry Peterson of the Lyons
Carnival Club as he led about 50 beer-swizzling maskers into the
streets outside Norby's bar. ``We'll make about 30 bars.''
   Dozens of parades draw the focus to the Carnival season, and the
club called Zulu, with its painted coconut giveaways, set out this
morning, one of 15 organizations planning to parade all day uptown
and downtown. Comus, New Orleans' oldest krewe, or parade club,
brings it to a close at night.
   Deputy Police Chief Arnesta Taylor said the crowd appeared
bigger this year than the 24 other Carnival seasons he has seen. He
said more than 1 million locals and tourists were expected for the
daylong partying.
   Rex, the masked king of Carnival who leads one of Mardi Gras'
biggest and richest parades, kicked off celebrations Monday night,
sailing into the city on the Mississippi aboard the Eagle, a Coast
Guard tall ship.
   Mayor Sidney Barthelemy welcomed Rex with the keys to the city
and read a proclamation ordering the suspension of laws and the
symbolic shutdown of the city until midnight tonight, when Lent
begins.
   ``Remember, this is the pre-celebration. The key is to pace
yourself,'' Barthelemy told the crowd on Canal Street, a backdrop
for a fireworks display over the Mississippi and a free concert by
the Neville Brothers.
   Mild temperatures and sunny skies helped unloosen numerous
``tourist participation'' flesh shows along the narrow streets of
the French Quarter, where police officers' tolerance level rises
markedly during Carnival.
   On Bourbon Street, tourists gaped and locals shouted ``Show
'em!'' as partyers tossed plastic beads at a woman who bared her
breasts in a hotel window. A police officer at a corner lifted a
camera.
   ``You're taking pictures, too?'' Sue Smith, 55, of Grosse Pointe
Park, Mich., asked incredulously.
   ``Sure,'' said the officer, who said he was aiming his camera at
a fellow policeman on another balcony.
   ``I'm a tourist,'' he told the disbelieving woman. ``I just
rented this suit.''
   Mardi Gras, French for fat Tuesday, is the last day of the
Carnival season, which ends with the start of Ash Wednesday at
midnight. Celebrations in heavily Catholic Louisiana begin Jan. 6
and crank up more than a week before today's climax.
   Three men were hospitalized after a Sunday night shooting during
a parade, police said. No arrests were made. Late last week, a
teen-ager fatally shot a man he saw with his former girlfriend
along a parade route, police said.

   Farmers from Delaware to Georgia fretted as winter returned
after weeks of unusually warm weather that had peach and apple
trees blooming early, but experts said the damage from the cold
would probably be limited.
   Temperatures moderated today after Monday's severe cold attack,
with Atlanta dipping only to 32 degrees and Macon, Ga., hitting a
low of 33. But while the mass of cold air was sliding slowly out to
sea, it held on in the Northeast, where Windor Locks, Conn., hit a
record low of 2 below zero.
   Experts said crops throughout the Middle Atlantic region
appeared to have been spared serious damage so far since cold moved
back in Sunday and Monday.
   ``Some of the peach trees were in full bloom and some had just
turned pink,'' Jim Olson of the North Carolina Department of
Agriculture said Monday. ``They (growers) are concerned, but it was
not as bad as they had anticipated.''
   ``Although temperatures plummeted to near freezing and below
throughout the state, they did not drop as low as earlier
predicted,'' Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin said.
``We were certainly fortunate to have survived without significant
damage to our peach, wheat and Vidalia onion crops.''
   Temperatures dipped into the teens in the Carolinas and as low
as 10 in Delaware early Monday, but peach and apple growers said no
severe damage was apparent.
   ``At this stage in their growth, it would have had to have
dropped to 7 degrees to really hurt,'' said Charles Smith, co-owner
of T.S. Smith &amp; Sons in Bridgeville, Del. ``We might have had some
damage. But we can't tell much. I don't think it was disastrous.''
   Smith said growers are concerned about temperatures in the next
few weeks because the unusual warm spell during much of January and
February _ when temperatures often reached into the 60s _ had fruit
trees blooming three weeks earlier than normal.
   Kitty Washburne, president of a mail-order flowering bulb
business in Garrison, Md., saw a good side to the chill _ it
reminded spring bulbs that it's only February.
   ``My immediate reaction was that I was kind of glad that we had
something to stop them a little bit in their zeal to come up,'' she
said.

<HEAD>High Court Says Some Patients at Mental Hospitals May Sue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   People held against their will at state mental
hospitals without receiving legally required hearings may sue
officials in federal court for monetary damages, the Supreme Court
ruled by a 5-4 vote today.
   The justices, reversing lower court rulings, said a Florida man
may sue in federal court over being held in a Florida state
hospital for five months without a hearing that state law requires
within 48 hours.
   Writing for the court, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said people
raising such claims are not limited to suing for damages in state
courts.
   Darrell Burch was found wandering along a Florida highway Dec.
7, 1981. He was taken to a Tallahassee community health services
center where he was held for three days.
   During that time, Burch was hallucinating. He believed he was in
heaven.
   After his stay at the center, Burch was transferred to the
Florida State Hospital, where he remained until May 7, 1982. his
lawsuit alleges that he was heavily medicated and disoriented when
arriving at the state hospital.
   Despite a state law that entitled him to a hearing within 48
hours of his admission to challenge his detention and treatment,
Burch did not receive a hearing.
   His federal lawsuit alleged that 11 officials and employees of
the Florida State Hospital acted ``with willful, wanton and
reckless disregard of and indifference to'' his due-process rights.
   The suit invoked a much-used civil rights law.
   A federal judge threw out the suit, ruling that Burch was barred
from filing it because he could win adequate relief in state court.
   A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the dismissal, but the entire appeals court voted 8-5 to
reinstate the suit.
   Today's decision upheld the 11th Circuit court's ruling, and
Burch's lawsuit can now proceed.
   Blackmun wrote that previous high court decisions limiting
access to federal courts if adequate state court remedies exist do
not apply to Burch's case because ``the deprivation of Burch's
liberty'' was not unpredictable.
   ``Under Florida's statutory scheme, only a person competent to
give informed consent may be admitted as a voluntary patient,''
Blackmun said. ``There is, however, no specified way of
determining, before a patient is asked to sign admission forms,
whether he is competent.''
   Therefore, Blackmun said, ``It is hardly unforeseeable that a
person requesting treatment for mental illness might be incapable
of informed consent, and that state officials with the power to
admit patients might take their apparent willingness to be admitted
at face value.''
   Blackmun was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Byron R.
White, Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy dissented.
   The case is Zinermon vs. Burch, 87-1965.

   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel today paid
homage to the late human rights activist Andrei Sakharov, one of
the few Soviets who openly welcomed the 1968 ``Prague Spring''
reforms and denounced the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Havel, Czechoslovakia's first non-Communist leader in 41 years,
also met with Soviet legislators and suggested an exchange of
parliamentary delegations, with the Czechoslovak side led by
Alexander Dubcek, the former Communist Party chief who authored the
1968 reforms.
   Dubcek's last two official visits to Moscow were humiliating. In
the first, days after the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion, he was
under arrest. In the second, two months later, he signed an
agreement allowing Soviet troops to stay on Czechoslovak soil
indefinitely and promising the country would return to
Soviet-style, hard-line rule.
   Dubcek was ousted as party chief in 1969 and returned to a
position of power only late last year, as head of Parliament
following that country's peaceful revolution.
   In sharp contrast to Dubcek's experience, Havel met with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev Monday and announced an accord to
withdraw the 73,500 Soviet troops from Czechoslovakia by July 1,
1991.
   ``We perfectly understood each other on various problems,''
Havel in an interview with Soviet television.
   He also agreed to help pay for the Soviet troops to leave his
country, provide free transport back home and help build housing
for the troops in the Soviet Union.
   Sakharov, who died in December, became a fierce campaigner for
human rights and reform after the Prague Spring reforms were
crushed by Soviet troops. He lived to see the Soviet government
condemn its invasion, but he did not see the election of Havel, a
former political prisoner, as Czechoslovak president.
   Havel visited the grave with Sakharov's widow, Yelena Bonner,
and Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier. They placed
flowers among the many bouquets which are constantly replenished by
mourners.
   The Czechoslovak leader also met today with members of the
Soviet parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, then walked across
Red Square to his car surrounded by security guards.
   Havel and the legislators discussed the parliaments of the two
countries and future exchanges, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady Gerasimov said.
   Havel arrived in Moscow for talks with Gorbachev on Monday, just
three days after returning from the United States, where he met
with President Bush.
   At a news conference Monday, Havel said he signed a joint
declaration with Gorbachev that opens the way for new cooperation
between the two countries. It suggested relations be developed ``on
the basis of equality and complete mutual respect for each other's
state sovereignty,'' according to Tass.
   The Czechovslovak delegation included Defense Minister Miroslav
Vacek and Interior Minister Richard Sacher, who wants to reduce
links between officials of his ministry and those of the Soviet KGB
operating on Czechoslovak soil.
   Havel, a playwright, spent five years in prison for his
political activities against the Czechoslovak government.

   Nelson Mandela received a hero's welcome
today as he set foot on foreign soil for the first time in 28 years.
   The black nationalist leader embraced exiled members of his
African National Congress and seven African presidents in an
emotional ceremony on the tarmac at the Lusaka airport.
   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, whose Southern African
nation has hosted the ANC's exile headquarters for almost two
decades, was the first to greet Mandela and his wife, Winnie.
   To drumbeats, Mandela was draped with garlands of red and white
flowers by the children of ANC exiles. Dozens of young ANC
guerrillas wearing black berets, ANC T-shirts and military fatigues
looked on.
   In his six-day visit, Mandela will meet African and Commonwealth
leaders, as well as with exiled ANC leaders from the organization's
35-member national executive committee and military wing. No agenda
for the ANC meetings has been released but officials indicated ANC
strategy and Mandela's role within the group would be discussed.
   Zambian officials said the talks with regional leaders will have
the most impact on political life in Southern Africa since the 1979
Lusaka Commonwealth summit. That meeting cleared the way for the
end of white minority rule in the former British colony of
Rhodesia, now independent Zimbabwe.
   About 10,000 people, including many South African exiles,
cheered, waving the ANC's distinctive black, green and gold colors,
when Mandela left the plane and raised a clenched-fist salute.
   He told the crowd he was happy to be visiting the second home of
exiled ANC leaders who molded the organization into a powerful
political and military force.
   ``They have led and directed our people to the point where we
are on the verge of a breathrough in our struggle for freedom,''
Mandela said.
   He praised Kaunda as a peacemaker who tried to persuade
successive governments in Pretoria to open dialogue with the ANC.
   But ``if we are compelled to resort to arms...the responsibility
for this lies firmly on the shoulders of the government,'' he said.
   Tens of thousands of well-wishers, exhorted by full-page
advertisements in government newspapers, lined the 15-mile route
from Lusaka airport to Kuanda's official residence, where Mandela
will stay.
   People waited in sweltering tropical temperatures for several
hours to catch a glimpse of the ANC leader, who was released from
prison in South Africa on Feb. 11.
   The crowds waved green branches, a traditional African symbol of
rejoicing, in the biggest public turnout since Pope John Paul II's
visit last May.
   Kaunda declared today a national holiday and Nelson Mandela Day.
Factories, offices and shops were closed in Lusaka, a city of 1
million. City authorities temporarily lifted a ban on public
gatherings imposed last month to curb an outbreak of cholera that
has killed more than 80 people.
   Mandela, leading a 20-member delegation of ANC leaders from
South Africa, was taken by a high-speed motorcade of limousines to
Lusaka's main conference complex, where he was to meet visiting
foreign dignitaries.
   During his stay in Zambia, Mandela will meet with leaders from
Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, as
well as from the 49-nation Commonwealth of former British
territories.
   ``We will obviously be examining how to proceed with the
political struggle and the armed struggle,'' a senior ANC official
said on condition of anonymity.
   He said the meeting will also select a 10-member ANC delegation
for preliminary talks with South African President F.W. de Klerk.
The talks will clear the way for negotiations on full participation
in South Africa by the 28 million disenfranchised blacks.
   The ANC says reforms announced by de Klerk, including the
lifting of a 30-year ban on the ANC on Feb. 2 and Mandela's
release, do not go far enough. But on Feb. 16, the group said it
was willing to hold its first direct talks with Pretoria.

<HEAD>Excommunicated Priest Condemns `Racist' Church</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic priest excommunicated
after he formed a black congregation received applause at a Jesuit
college when he condemned the church as racist, and ordered guards
to throw out a heckler.
   The Rev. George Stallings, who was excommunicated after forming
the African-American Catholic Congregation in Washington, D.C.,
last summer, addressed an audience of about 1,300 people Monday at
Le Moyne College.
   He was applauded when he said the Catholic Church ``remains
primarily a white, racist institution in the United States,'' and
that he would both expose the racism of the church and provide an
alternative.
   But Stallings received some opposition when he strayed from the
issue of racism.
   Stallings, who claims a following of about 2,200 people, began
listing his congregation's support for birth control, female
priests, married priests, and permission for Catholic couples to
divorce.
   ``What right do they (church leaders) have to say that I ...
should not have the right to break that relationship and move into
a wholesome, healthy and protective relationship?'' Stallings asked.
   A man in the audience yelled ``Jesus said it!'' and began moving
toward Stallings. ``That's who said it.''
   Stallings, quickly surrounded by guards and supporters, ordered
guards to throw the man out.
   ``I am the one who is giving the lecture, sir, not you,'' he
said. ``Get him out and put him out.''
   Two other dissenters stood outside of the building with posters
protesting abortion and Stallings' appearance. Stallings does not
support Catholic Church opposition to abortion, saying he supports
free choice in the matter.
   Stallings said his church will allow priests to marry. But he
said he wouldn't marry a nun, as some ex-priests have.
   ``When I get married it won't be to a nun. I can tell you
that,'' he said. ``Because she might have more hangups than I do.''

   A determined Mikhail S. Gorbachev today pushed
through the legislature his proposal for a Western-style presidency
despite vigorous objections that the new post would concentrate too
much power in one man's hands.
   Amid shouts of protest from lawmakers who warned of the dangers
of dictatorship, Gorbachev called the vote for his proposal ``a
great political event in the history of our state.''
   The vote in the Supreme Soviet was 347-24, with 43 abstentions,
in favor of the bill that approves creation of the presidency in
principle. The bill now goes to committees, who will consider
numerous amendments proposed during a day of heated debate.
   Then, the Congress of People's Deputies, the Supreme Soviet's
parent body, will meet March 12-13 to elect a president.
   The bill would give the president sweeping powers to declare
war, veto legislation, impose a state of emergency and call a
referendum on legislative decisions he doesn't approve of.
   During the debate today, liberals said the creation of a
presidency is premature, and they accused the leadership of trying
to rush the issue through.
   But Gorbachev angrily rejected critics, saying they had engaged
in ``cheap demagoguery.'' Legislators shouted in protest from the
floor.
   ``Everything I believe necessary to say I'll say,'' the
58-year-old Kremlin chief shouted back.
   One legislator, a taxi driver from the Ukraine who last year
compared Gorbachev to Napoleon on national television, said he saw
a bad omen in the voting.
   ``The way the voting went from the floor today is the same way
presidential power will be,'' shouted Leonid Sukhov in an obvious
reference to Gorbachev's pressure.
   Pro-democracy demonstrators in several Soviet cities over the
weekend said the president would become a dictator, and one sign at
a Leningrad rally warned the new post could lead to fascism.
   The Supreme Soviet refused Feb. 14 to be stampeded into setting
a timetable for approving a presidency modeled after the American
and French systems.
   Gorbachev has said a strong president is needed as part of his
blueprint for transferring power from the Communist Party to the
government. It is a radical departure from Soviet political
practice stretching back to the days of Stalin, when the party
leader was supreme ruler.
   Before the vote, liberals led by Sergei Stankevich, a student of
American politics and spokesman for the Inter-Regional Deputies
Group, and Anatoly Sobchak, a Leningrad legislator, said the
presidency as proposed would be subject to abuse.
   ``All our decisions can be crossed out by the president,''
Sobchak told the 542-member legislature.
   He and Stankevich said the proposed presidency would tilt the
balance of power toward the chief executive and away from the
legislature.
   Many Soviets today see the need for an iron hand to solve the
country's problems.
   ``We're tired from social tension. When are you going to put the
country in order?'' legislator Rano Ubaidullaeva said her
constituents are saying. ``We need a person who can have real power
... the quicker the better.''
   The draft bill released today says the president must be a
Soviet citizen and be at least 35 years old. He would be elected to
a five-year term directly by universal suffrage.
   The official who introduced the bill, however, said the
procedure would be different the first time.
   Vladimir Kudryavtsev, a vice president of the Academy of
Sciences, said the first president would be elected by the Congress
of People's Deputies to a four-year term. He said it would take too
long to prepare direct elections now.
   Other provisions would give the president power to declare a
state of emergency or war, to serve as commander-in-chief of the
armed forces, and to veto legislation. The Supreme Soviet could
override the veto by a majority vote but the president could then
appeal to the congress or call a referendum on the issue.
   The president could also ask the legislature to hold a vote of
no confidence in the country's premier and Council of Ministers,
the nominal Cabinet.
   A new body of advisers would be created, called a ``presidential
council.''
   For the first time, the law specifies a detailed procedure of
succession if the president is unable to fulfill his duties. The
chairman of the Supreme Soviet or premier would rule until
presidential elections are held within three months.
   In another first, the bill provides for impeachment of the
president if he violates the constitution.
   A majority of Baltic legislators announced they will not
participate in the debate or vote on the proposed presidency
because they believe it inappropriate to do so before the structure
between the republics and central government is decided.
   Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are fighting to restore the
independence they had between the two world wars.
   Georgian lawmakers also announced they would not participate,
because they said it was unclear how the office would be used.
   It is widely assumed Gorbachev will seek the post, but he has
refused to commit himself as a candidate.

   President Bush is failing to back up his
rhetoric about educational excellence with federal money, and the
administration's proposed 2 percent spending increase for schools
is ``meager'' and ``tepid,'' House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said
today.
   ``While I commend the president for his desire to be known as
`the education president,' I question whether he can achieve that
goal by proposing a meager 2 percent increase in the federal
spending on education,'' Foley told the nation's governors.
   ``The simple fact is we don't have a 2 percent education problem
in this country,'' he said. ``The education gap is much more
daunting.''
   Foley spoke to the bipartisan National Governors' Association as
it concluded its annual winter meeting.
   Speaking to the state executives on Monday, Bush praised their
education goals but left some Democratic governors grumbling that
the administration wasn't recommending additional money to help the
states pay for implementing them.
   Foley said Bush's proposed education spending amounted to
``tepid incrementalism.'' He said the United States lags behind
much of the industrial world in per capita spending on kindergarten
through 12th grade education.
   ``We need bolder action,'' he said.
   Foley also said the lessening in world tensions would result in
budget savings for the United States _ the ``peace dividend''
anticipated from reduced demands for military spending.
   Answering questions from the governors, Foley predicted an
actual cut in military spending, not just in its rate of growth.
But he said the ``absolute reduction'' would probably take about
five years to appear.
   He also complained that the administration was not releasing for
spending on highways and airports money accumulated from excise
taxes in trust funds _ a frequent complaint of the governors.
   Foley said that amounted to $17 billion for highways and $14
billion for airports _ money he said was being retained to make the
federal deficit look smaller.
   The governors' main accomplishments at their meeting came Sunday
with approval of a set of goals for improving education, and
Monday's meeting with Bush at the White House.
   Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio, chairman of the Democratic
governors, said he asked Bush in their private meeting about
putting more money into education. Celeste said the money was
needed ``to translate what is ambitious rhetoric into action.''
   ``He seemed unaccountably reluctant to make any commitments,''
Celeste said. ``He steered away from anything that would smack of
additional resources.''
   The group's education goals follow closely the proposals Bush
made last month in his State of the Union speech. Bush praised the
governors for their work on education and said he would try to keep
it ``in the forefront of America's agenda.''
   ``We are launching a new era in education reform,'' Bush said.
``Its focus, high expectations; its hallmark, results.''
   Republican Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, chairman of the National
Governors' Association, said governors were ``committed over the
next decade to holding ourselves accountable'' on meeting the goals.
   But Democratic Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia said the goals
may not be reachable if the federal government doesn't propose more
funds.
   Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina, who was
co-chairman of the governors' education task force, noted that the
federal government pays only about 7 percent of the cost of public
schools.
   ``We're going to have to carry the bulk of this, we and the
local communities,'' he said.
   The governors were voting today on several policy resolutions,
including one recommending a clean-air act requiring up to 1
million vehicles be produced annually that make use of an
alternative fuel.
   Celeste, a two-term governor barred by Ohio state law from
seeking re-election this year, gave voice to Democrats' frustration
with Bush's sky-high approval rating in the polls.
   ``A president with an 80 percent popularity rating _ he could
take on any tough issue. What is the tough issue he's going to take
on? I don't see any. He's sort of suspended out there, as I say, in
his own medium, at a distance from all of us,'' he said.

   Fewer than 2 percent of Americans questioned
in a new survey say they might try cocaine if it were legal _ but
60 percent say they think someone else would.
   Three-fifths of those questioned in the poll released today by
the Drug Policy Foundation said all drug use is immoral and should
be illegal, while 35 percent disagreed.
   And 55 percent said they believe the Bush administration's war
on drugs is likely to reduce the drug problem, while 36 percent
favored legalization of less serious drugs along with an increase
in drug treatment and education.
   When given the choice between providing treatment and counseling
for drug users or punishing drug users with fines and-or
imprisonment, 68 percent favored treatment and 21 percent favored
punishment.
   ``In rejecting the war on drug users and in choosing not to use
drugs even if drugs were legal, Americans are saying, `Make health,
not war,''' foundation President Arnold S. Trebach said in a
statement released with the survey.
   Trebach said today that he interpreted the survey to mean, ``In
general, the American people say, `We would like a compromise. We
would like to see that we treat this problem within the health
system, not the criminal justice system.' If they see no option,
they might go for the criminal justice system. ... I think it's a
call for enlightened leadership.''
   The Drug Policy Foundation advocates treating drug abuse as a
health problem, not a criminal justice issue, and has encouraged
drug decriminalization efforts.
   Despite the 61 percent who said all drug use is immoral and
should be illegal, foundation Vice President Kevin Zeese said,
``There is significant support for outright legalization of drugs.
Americans are realizing that more jails, more arrests and more
seizures will never solve the drug problem.''
   National drug control policy director William J. Bennett has
called legalization advocacy ``stupid and morally atrocious.''
   Bennett, speaking briefly to reporters at the White House today,
brushed off the report and said some progress has been made.
   ``Now that we're starting to see some encouraging signs, why put
up the white flag?'' he said.
   The poll of 1,401 adult Americans in a random, digital-dial
telephone sample done Jan. 24-Feb. 4 by Targeting Systems Inc. of
Arlington, Va., has a margin of error of 3 percentage points, said
company President Charles Welsh. Richard J. Dennis of Chicago,
chairman of the Drug Policy Foundation Advisory Board, paid for the
survey.
   The survey revealed some mixed messages. While 36 percent said
they favored legalization of less dangerous drugs combined with
more treatment and education over the Bush administration plan, 75
percent said they wanted more federal law enforcement efforts.
   Seventy percent said they wanted more federal drug treatment and
education, and 71 percent said it was more important to take ``any
step necessary'' to stop drug use than to protect civil rights and
civil liberties.
   Trebach said today that the response to that latter question
made him ``very nervous.''
   ``My interpretation of that is ... the American people are
annoyed enough about this drug problem, worried enough about it,
that if their leaders suggest an invasion of a little country in
South America ... if they suggest a search of cars and all kinds of
other invasions of civil rights, it is possible the American people
will support it. That is an enormous danger,'' he said.
   Of those polled, 11 percent said they had tried cocaine
hydrochloride _ cocaine powder _ while 89 percent said they had not.
   Asked the likelihood of their trying cocaine if that drug were
legalized, 1.7 percent said they were very likely or somewhat
likely to do so, while 96.9 percent said they were unlikely to try
it.
   However, 60 percent said they believe cocaine use would increase
if it were no longer a crime. Ten percent said cocaine use would
decrease while 27 percent said it would stay the same.
   Of those who had never tried cocaine, 0.9 percent said they
might try it if it were legalized, while 9 percent of those who had
used it before said they were at least somewhat likely to try it
again.
   For marijuana, 35 percent of those polled said they had tried
it, 65 percent had not. Overall, 88.8 percent said they were not
very likely or not at all likely to try it if it were legalized,
while 9.6 percent said they might. But 50 percent said marijuana
use would increase if it were legalized, while 12 percent said it
would decrease and 37 percent said it would stay the same.
   Regarding medical use of some prohibited drugs, 76 percent said
physicians should be allowed to prescribe heroin as a painkiller
for terminally ill cancer patients, and 69 percent said they should
be allowed to prescribe marijuana as a treatment for glaucoma.
   One question was prefaced with the statement: ``The current law
enforcement efforts to curb drug use cost taxpayers hundreds of
millions of dollars per year, with an ever-increasing prison
population reaching 1 million people in the U.S.''
   Respondents then were asked whether tax dollars are best used
for ``imprisoning all drug users'' or whether ``other less
expensive methods such as treatment programs and drug education
should be allocated more of the tax dollars.'' In response, 74
percent selected treatment and education, 13 percent chose
imprisonment for all drug users, 7 percent volunteered that both
were good choices.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rebounded
strongly today from its second-steepest one-day plunge ever as
investors took comfort from advances on major overseas markets,
analysts said.
   The dollar continued its gain against the Japanese yen for the
sixth consecutive trading day, reaching an eight-month high despite
heavy dollar-selling by Japan's central bank in support of the yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues climbed 576.08
points, or 1.73 percent, closing at 33,897.95.
   On Monday, it had fallen 4.5 percent, or 1,569.10 points, second
only to the 3,836.48-point plunge on Oct. 20, 1987, following Wall
Street's ``Black Monday.''
   The gain in Tokyo helped boost prices in New York and London
today.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 6.98 to
2,609.46 at 11 a.m. EST. Traders said the U.S. market was reassured
by the improvement on the Tokyo exchange.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index,
the major barometer of the British equities market, was up 7.1
points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,256.4 at midday.
   There was disagreement on whether the Tokyo market had hit
bottom, but Shiro Suzuki, an analyst at Nikko Securities Co., said,
``Especially individual investors gained confidence since Monday's
plunge did not have negative effects on the New York and London
markets overnight.''
   Suzuki said there would be no major buying by institutional
investors, now awaiting account settlements at the end of Japan's
fiscal year on March 31.
   The recent fall of Tokyo stock prices has been blamed on stock,
bond and yen prices all driving each other down in a vicious cycle,
and on computer-guided trading by foreign brokerages taking
advantage of different prices for the same issue on different
markets, for instance the spot and futures markets.
   Late Monday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange asked major securities
companies to restrict this arbitrage selling.
   Also Monday, the Finance Ministry bought some $671 million worth
of 10-year government bonds in an attempt to stop bond prices from
falling and to push long-term interest rates down.
   In this morning's session, arbitrage selling by some securities
firms for profit-taking amounted to some $201 million, said
Kazuyuki Suzuki, a dealer with Daiwa Securities Co. He said this
brought a moderate decline in the index, which later climbed again.
   Hironobu Takahashi, a spokesman of the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
said, ``It is rather difficult to evaluate the market reaction from
just one day of trading, but I believe our member firms understood
what we asked yesterday and tried to be cooperative.''
   On Monday, when the Finance Ministry was buying bonds, the yield
for the benchmark No. 119 10-year government bond fell to 6.875
percent from a high of 7.015 percent. The ministry stayed out of

   A judge today ordered the acquittal of a
state social worker accused of failing to report suspected child
abuse prior to the potty-training death of a toddler.
   After the state called three witnesses, Polk County Judge Jesse
Barber said that prosecutors simply didn't prove the charge and
issued the directed verdict.
   ``No reasonable jury could reach any other verdict than for
acquittal,'' the judge said after two key state witnesses testified
the social worker acted appropriately.
   Kenneth Houk was the first of three state Department of Health
and Rehabilitative Services workers to face trial in connection
with the death of 2-year-old Bradley McGee.
   The toddler died July 28 of head injuries after he was dunked
repeatedly headfirst into a toilet for soiling his pants and beaten
with pillows, prosecutors said.
   The trial marks the first time in Florida that a child-care
worker has been prosecuted for his handling of a case. The
misdemeanor carried a maximum penalty of up to 60 days in jail.
   Bradley's mother and stepfather _ Sheryl McGee Coe, 21, and
Thomas Coe, 22, of Lakeland _ face trial this summer on
first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse charges.
   Houk, 39, was accused of twice failing to call the HRS abuse
hotline when he received calls about Bradley.
   Prosecutors said Houk got a call in December 1988 claiming the
mother was unfit because she was drinking and using cocaine; and
only weeks before Bradley's death, he received another call that
the baby's mother had forced him to eat feces as punishment for
violating potty training.
   A key state witness, Theresa Jacobs, who originally reported the
feces complaint, told the jury that Houk had urged her numerous
times to telephone the child abuse registry when she had a
complaint to report.
   She said she didn't follow his advice.
   ``He had told me before to call the registry, but I never got
any satisfaction from the registry,'' Ms. Jacobs testified. ``I
didn't see him eat feces. I didn't see the bruises.''
   Houk's attorneys claim he acted in good faith by telling Ms.
Jacobs the first time to notify the toddler's assigned caseworker.
   ``He did not just not do anything,'' Wilkins said, ``They're
saying he did the wrong thing.''
   A jury was chosen Monday. Attorneys found all of the prospective
jurors were familiar with the Bradley McGee case _ with some saying
they had read every news article about it.
   Caseworkers Margaret Barber and Shirley Duboise are also charged
with failing to report child abuse in the case. Ms. Barber faces an
additional charge of felony child abuse.

   Authorities today defended police checkpoints
as an effective weapon against drunken driving, but an attorney for
a group of Michigan motorists told the Supreme Court the stops
violate privacy and do not work.
   ``We think they are very effective,'' said Thomas L. Casey,
assistant state solicitor general in Michigan. ``They do result in
arrests of drunk drivers. They do have a deterrent effect. They do
have an educational effect.''
   Mark Granzotto, a Detroit lawyer representing the motorists,
argued, however, ``As a means of acting against drunken driving,
sobriety roadblocks are worthless.''
   ``They don't work,'' Granzotto said when challenged by Chief
Justice William Rehnquist to explain why they were ineffective.
   Justice Byron White asked Granzotto why, if the roadbocks are
ineffective, many states have adopted them.
   ``They are a very visible means of showing that something is
being done,'' the lawyer replied.
   Casey argued that the intrusion into people's privacy has been
kept to a minimum under the Michigan procedure.
   He said people have to be willing to be ``a little bit
inconvenienced'' because of the seriousness of the drunken-driving
problem.
   Granzotto said he did not disagree that the problem is serious.
   However, he said, ``We have an intrusion that may be minimal in
some respects, but it is an intrusion that does not accomplish
anything.''
   The court's decision is expected by July.
   Lower courts have split on the issue. Some have upheld the use
of checkpoints. Others, like the Michigan courts, have ruled that
such police tactics violate privacy rights.
   President Bush called on state and local governments in December
to step up the fight against drunken driving.
   ``It's as crippling as crack, as random gang violence, and it's
killing more kids than both combined,'' he said.
   The president noted that state and local governments are
receiving federal aid to operate sobriety checkpoints.
   Michigan state police first used sobriety checkpoints, which
they modeled after a program used in Maryland, in 1986.
   At a checkpoint site, police directed all traffic headed in one
direction to a roadside area where officers checked motorists for
signs of intoxication.
   If there was no immediate evidence of intoxication, the motorist
was given a traffic safety brochure and allowed to drive away. The
average delay was about a half-minute.
   If some signs of intoxication were detected, a driver was
directed to another area for further questioning and perhaps a
breath test.
   At one such checkpoint, Michigan state police troopers checked
126 vehicles in less than an hour and detained two drivers for
sobriety field tests. One driver was arrested on drunken driving
charges.
   Seven Michigan residents sued the state police soon after the
checkpoint program began. Their lawsuit alleged that the
checkpoints violated the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable
police searches and arrests.
   State courts struck down the practice, citing ``the potential
for an unreasonable subjective intrusion on individual liberty
interests.''
   Michigan's appeal is being supported in ``friend of the court''
briefs by 27 states and groups including the National Governors'
Association, the National League of Cities, Mothers Against Drunk
Driving and the Alliance of American Insurers.
   The Supreme Court in 1979 barred police from randomly stopping
vehicles to check registration papers. In that Delaware case,
officers had total discretion over which vehicles were stopped.
   But the 1979 decision did not rule out spot checks in which an
officer's discretion was not so unconstrained. ``Questioning of all
oncoming traffic at roadblock-type stops is one possible
alternative,'' the decision said.
   At issue in a separate case from Pennsylvania also being heard
today was whether motorists must be given so-called Miranda
warnings before police videotape their taking sobriety field tests.
   The court will decide by July whether police violated a
motorist's rights when they videotaped his answers to questions
about his height, weight and eye color before telling him he could
remain silent and was entitled to have a lawyer present.
   The cases are Michigan State Police vs. Sitz, 88-1897, and
Pennsylvania vs. Muniz, 89-213.

<TEXT>
   Newly re-elected Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu today
formed a new Cabinet after hours of factional wrangling and
succeeded in keeping out scandal-tainted politicians.
   The backstage maneuvering followed Parliament's vote earlier
tday to leave the prime minister's post with Kaifu, who led his
Liberal Democratic Party to victory in crucial elections Feb. 18
for Parliament's powerful lower house.
   Kaifu completed the delicate task of distributing Cabinet
portfolios among party factions just three days before leaving for
a summit meeting with President Bush.
   In a major test of his political muscle, Kaifu was able to
resist a senior faction leader who pushed strongly for the
inclusion of Koko Sato. Sato had been given a suspended sentence in
a 1970s scandal in which Lockheed Aircraft Corp. paid bribes to
politicians to influence sales of its aircraft in Japan.
   As expected, Kaifu retained Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama and
Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to preserve continuity in
dealing with an unpopular new sales tax and trade frictions with
the United States.
   Kaifu became prime minister last August after two predecessors
resigned over the more Recruit influence-buying scandal and the
governing party's loss of its upper house majority for the first
time in 34 years.
   With his clean image, Kaifu got the nod despite his weak power
base in the party. Senior leaders stayed on the sidelines because
of their links to the Recruit scandal.
   But with the party's unexpectedly comfortable majority in the
Feb. 18 elections, Kaifu felt his position strengthened, while
party elders insisted the result also meant public exoneration for
scandal-tainted politicians who retained their seats in parliament.
Kaifu insisted on keeping a ``clean'' Cabinet.
   Former Finance Minister Michio Watanabe stalled negotiations for
several hours by insisting on a post for Sato, a close ally who has
been elected to the lower house nine times but never served as a
Cabinet minister.
   Former Agriculture Minister Kabun Muto was named minister of
international trade and industry, another sensitive post as
Washington steps up demands that Japan restructure its economy to
eradicate its $49 billion trade surplus with the United States.
   Trade will be a main topic taken up by Kaifu and Bush in their
two-day meeting Friday and Saturday.
   Other lawmakers who were appointed Cabinet ministers included
Justice Minister Shin Hasegawa, Labor Minister Shunpei Tsukahara,
Construction Minister Tamisuke Watanuki, Education Minister Kosuke
Hori and Defense Agency Director General Yozo Ishikawa.
   Dropped from the Cabinet were both women from Kaifu's first
Cabinet. One of them, Mayumi Moriyama, a member of the upper house,
had been chief Cabinet secretary, the top government spokeswoman.
   She was reported angered at being replaced by Misoji Sakamoto,
another top Kaifu aide, despite her tireless campaigning in the
election. Women voters have been getting increased attention,
especially after their strong objections to a new 3 percent sales
tax were seen as a key factor in the governing party's upper house
losses in last July's elections.
   Economic Planning Agency Director General Sumiko Takahara, also
was replaced by a man, Hideyuki Aizawa.
   The Cabinet resigned en masse earlier today, paving the way for
Kaifu to reorganize his administration after a flurry of meetings
with the party's various faction heads.
   Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, ex-Foreign Minister
Shintaro Abe and ex-Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa _ all linked
to the Recruit scandal _ control the three largest factions.
   Kaifu, 59, belongs to a minor faction led by former state
minister Toshio Komoto and needs the support of the larger factions
to maintain the party presidency and thus the prime minister's
position.
   In Parliament, Kaifu won 286 of 508 valid votes cast in the
powerful lower house, which formally chooses the prime minister. He
needed a majority of 255 to win. Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako
Doi, his nearest rival, won 146.
   Kaifu bowed as his formal re-election was proclaimed. He was
greeted by a round of rousing applause and scattered cheers.
   In the opposition-controlled, 252-seat upper house, Kaifu failed
to win a clear majority in the first round of balloting, but won in
a run-off with Ms. Doi 111-91. Forty-four ballots were left blank.
   The lower house decision is binding with or without the assent
of the upper house, but the lack of consensus is rare. When Kaifu
first assumed office six months ago, he was the first prime
minister in 41 years who was not nominated by both houses.

   A man dubbed the ``gentleman bandit''

been sentenced to 37 months in prison.
   Kevin Lee Newby on Monday also was ordered to pay $8,972 in

   Newby used a toy pistol in the robberies and told some of the
tellers to ``have a nice day'' and promised to send them roses.
   He pleaded guilty in November to robbing the First Federal
Savings and Loan Association in Grandview, Mo., on April 24, and
the World Savings &amp; Loan Association in Lenexa on Aug. 9. Charges
in three other robberies were dismissed.
   Newby told police he had been out of work and was trying to find

   Farmers will turn the famed Champs-Elysees into a
gigantic field of golden wheat that they will harvest in June to
celebrate French agriculture.
   The 4{-acre field will stretch halfway down the avenue, which
will be closed to traffic, starting from the Arc de Triomphe.
   ``The Big Harvest,'' to take place on June 24 at the cost of
$4.7 million, is sponsored by the National Center For Young Farmers
to focus attention on the positive aspects of farming.
   ``When farming adopts a friendly, convivial tone, the rest of
the world is interested,'' said Henry Jouve, president of the
center.
   The 24-hour extravaganza will culminate with a show by 500
farmers, including agricultural displays and musical performances.
   The wheat already has been planted in special greenhouses
outside Paris. It is expected to be ripe for picking by June 23,
when 1,000 young farmers will truck it into the capital and install
it on the Champs-Elysees.

<HEAD>Mount Everest Cleanup Will Be a New Kind of Superpower Summitry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chinese, American and Soviet mountaineers plan to
scale Mount Everest and clean up some of the 2 tons of discarded
tents, oxygen bottles and other garbage left by generations of
climbers on the world's highest peak.
   The expedition _ a new kind of superpower summitry _ is China's
biggest joint cultural undertaking with any foreign country since
June, when its violent crackdown on protesters strained ties with
many countries.
   Jim Whittaker of Port Townsend, Wash., who organized what he is
calling the Everest Peace Climb, tried to emphasize the political
implications at a U.S. Embassy reception Tuesday on the eve of the
team's flight to Tibet.
   Will the friendly climb affect tense Chinese-American relations?
   ``We hope it will, we hope there's peace,'' Whittaker answered
quickly. ``One Chinese, one Soviet and one American will stand on
the summit with our arms around each other, demonstrating that with
cooperation, high goals can be reached.''
   But U.S. Ambassador James Lilley, to whom the question had been
directed, smiled uncomfortably and said, ``I believe it stands on
its own: normal people-to-people relations.''
   For several hours, Chinese, American and Soviet officials
mingled at Lilley's residence and heard speeches about friendship
and cooperation _ a scene that was common in Beijing before June
but has become rare since.
   China has accused the United States of seeking to undermine its
socialist system, and privately has labeled the Soviets
``revisionist'' for political reforms that have weakened the role
of the Communist Party.
   All three countries appeared in agreement, however, on the need
to clean up Mount Everest. The team of 17 Americans, 17 Chinese and
12 Soviets plans to bring down as much as it can of the estimated 2
tons of garbage left at camp sites on the Himalayan peak on the
Nepal-Tibet border.
   ``We're going to take duffle bags and load them up,'' said
Whittaker, 61. ``In places we can drop (the garbage), let it
free-fall, and then we'll pick it up at the bottom, burn what will
burn and bury the rest.
   ``We want to leave no trace of humans on the mountain.''
   The 29,028-foot mountain was first scaled in 1953 by Sir Edmund
Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Since then, dozens of teams have
swarmed over its lower reaches each year, although fewer than 250
climbers have reached the top.
   Whittaker, who in 1963 became the first American to reach Mount
Everest's summit, said he saw no sign at the top of those who went
before him, but that his own team left empty oxygen bottles and
other debris.
   ``We thought differently in those days. We weren't as concerned
about the environment because there weren't so many people going
into the hills,'' he said.
   The expedition plans to send only three people to the summit,
one from each country. Their target date is April 22, Earth Day.
   Whittaker said the summiteers will use a satellite hook-up to
converse from the peak with President Bush, Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and a Chinese leader. Chinese sports officials
said that probably will be Premier Li Peng.
   Teams from the three countries made practice climbs together on
Mount Rainier in the United States in June and in the Caucasus
Mountains in the Soviet Union in September. Mount Rainier is less
than half as high as Mount Everest, at 14,410 feet.
   After the first joint climb, the Chinese changed their team,
however, and it is now made up mostly of Tibetans.
   Most of the more than $1 million cost of the expedition is being
paid by U.S. corporate sponsors and individual donations.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ARMENIA _ Armenians elect a new Supreme Soviet on May 20. The
current legislature passed a resolution Dec. 1 that called for
reuniting the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh to the
republic. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev branded the resolution
unconstitutional. The disputed territory is being directly
controlled by a special Kremlin commission.

<TEXT>
   AZERBAIJAN _ Beset by ethnic unrest in the capital of Baku, a
state of emergency and curfew are in effect in this southern
republic and a date for Supreme Soviet elections has yet to be
announced. The republic is locked in a bitter dispute with Armenia
over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, the mainly Armenian Christian
enclave inside predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan. The dispute has led
to hundreds of deaths in the two republics in the past two years.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BYELORUSSIA _ The Byelorussian Popular Front is organizing a
challenge to the Communist Party in elections scheduled for March
4. The Popular Front has accused the republic's authorities of
refusing to register pro-democracy candidates for the election.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ESTONIA _ As in Latvia and Lithuania, the People's Front in the
Baltic republic of Estonia demands independence from the Soviet
Union. In local elections Dec. 10, non-Communists won about half
the ballots. Estonians will elect a new Supreme Soviet on March 18.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GEORGIA _ Militant nationalists are demanding independence. At a
pro-independence rally in April 1989, 19 people were killed in
clashes with Soviet soldiers. Georgians vote for a new Supreme
Soviet on June 17, and independence will be a key campaign issue.
The region is also beset by disputes in which the Abkhazian and
Ossetian minorities are demanding more autonomy from the republic's
ethnic Georgian majority.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   KAZAKHSTAN _ Ethnic problems have been simmering in this central
Asian republic since December 1986, when residents rioted over the
replacement of Communist Party chief Dinmukhamed Kunaev, a Kazakh,
by a Russian, Gennady Kolbin. Voters go to the polls March 25 to
elect a new Supreme Soviet.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   KIRGIZIA _ In Supreme Soviet elections Feb. 25, voters failed to
elect candidates in more than half the constituencies. A runoff
election has been scheduled for early March. Kirgizian nationalists
are demanding official status for their own language. Better food
supplies and housing also are among activists' demands.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LATVIA _ The People's Front, in elections in December, garnered
more than half the vote, signaling it will do well when a new
legislature is elected March 18. Like other People's Fronts in the
Baltics, it wants complete independence from the Soviet Union.
Latvia in December became the second Baltic republic to abolish the
Communist Party's constitutional monopoly on power. About 50
percent of the population is Russian, compared with much lower
ratios in other Baltic states.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LITHUANIA _ Sajudis, the secessionist Lithuanian popular front
movement, won 72 out of 90 parliamentary seats in the first round
of multiparty voting Feb. 24, according to unofficial results. The
remaining 51 seats will be contested in runoff elections March 10
and April 7. The Lithuanian Communist Party broke with the Kremlin
in December and came out in favor of indepedence. A smaller group
of Soviet loyalists formed their own Communist Party.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MOLDAVIA _ Moldavians had their first free elections Feb. 25
with the Moldavian Popular Front, an independent political
movement, challenging the Communist Party. Official results are
expected Thursday, and the Moldavian People's Front is expected to
win about half the 380 seats in parliament. Moldavia has a common
heritage with Romania and many ethnic Moldavias would like to be
reunified. But, the Popular Front says reunification should be put
on hold in favor of rebuilding the economy and restoring Moldavian
culture.

   RUSSIAN FEDERATION _ Political activists in the Russian
Federation, the largest of the 15 republics, have formed a People's
Front and similar organizations demanding basic reforms in the rule

president. Voters elect a new Supreme Soviet on March 4. Supporters
of political maverick Boris Yeltsin are urging him to run for its
presidency, but he has not announced his candidacy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   TADZHIKSTAN _ Elections were held Feb. 25, with runoff elections
scheduled for March after candidates failed to gain a majority in
more than half the constituencies. Clashes between Tadzhiks and
Soviet soldiers sent to stop attacks on Armenians in the capital of
Dushanbe in early February left 22 people dead. Tadzhiks demand

third of the Communist Party candidates their majorities. Several
first secretaries of districts and regions are among those facing
runoff elections in March.

   UKRAINE _ A nascent nationalist movement is emerging in the
Ukraine, the Soviet Union's second largest republic. Rukh, the
organization of progressive nationalists, wants an independent
Ukraine. But, unlike populist movements in the Baltics, Rukh does
not have widespread support of the people. The Ukraine will elect a
new Supreme Soviet on March 4.

   UZBEKISTAN _ Voters in elections Feb. 18 complained that ballots
did not have alternative candidates and independent groups
boycotted the election. Many other voters crossed out the
candidates' names, rendering the ballots invalid. Ethnic tensions
run high with minority Meskhetian Turks, forcibly resettled from
Georgia in the 1940s, demanding a homeland of their own. Many say
overcrowding and lack of jobs have created an explosive situation.

   The chroniclers of Communist abuses are
amassing a list of valuable works of art from Polish museums loaned
to party and government ministries but never returned.
   ``Thanks to those loans, many very valuable objects were lost.
But things are changing,'' a television commentator said in a
recent report.
   The Polish opposition has taken power without the virulence seen
in other East bloc nations where Communist leaders have been tried
and imprisoned. But the public fascination has been caught by a
series of exposes of long-suspected abuses from the four decades
when the Communist Party had total control of the government.
   The press has reported in detail the party's amassing of vast
property holdings through dubious leases from obliging city
officials.
   Now it has turned to the works of art provided to the Communist
Party Central Committee and government ministries when refusing was
not a viable option for museum directors.
   The prosecutor's office has been called in. And the Social
Democracy of the Polish Republic, the newly formed party that took
over the assets and liabilities of the Communist Party dissolved in
January, has tried to demonstrate its new thinking with a promise
to help locate the lost national property.
   ``The obligation is to figure out all those secrets that now
have been made public, for example the vanishing of those
paintings, and we want to take an active part,'' Marek Siwiec,
editor of the party's newspaper, Trybuna, said in an interview.
   But he said those individuals responsible should be prosecuted,
not the party.
   ``If a crime occurred, and everything indicates that a crime was
committed, ... one chases particular persons responsible, and does
not stigmatize an institution in which those persons worked,''
Siwiec said.
   The Social Democracy party might make ``moral compensation,''
however, in money or other works of art, he said.
   According to a report in the government daily Rzeczpospolita,
``the list of missing objects is thick.''
   Ten paintings and two sculptures are missing from among 96
objects borrowed from the National Museum by the Central Committee.
   Among the lost canvases are the 1915 ``Still Life with Two
Jugs'' by Tadeusz Makowski, borrowed in 1975, and the 1909 ``Head
of a Peasant Girl'' by Teodor Azentowicz, loaned in 1950.
   ``The Pond'' by J.M Ronowski hung in the Central Committee
headquarters for a decade and only recently was noticed to be
missing, the newspaper said.
   Missing since the 1970s from the Council of Ministers are seven
valuable 19th century German pottery statuettes, borrowed in 1949
for then-Premier Jozef Cyrankiewicz, Rzeczpospolita said.
   By November, only a third of the approximately 100 paintings and
decorative objects loaned to the Culture Ministry had been
returned, the daily reported.
   Marian Soltysiak, director of the National Museum, told Polish
TV this week that one lost object has been found in the Central
Committee headquarters and three more in the National Defense
Ministry.
   ``And now I can see the breakthrough in our relations with the
central institutions that were borrowing objects,'' he said.

   Two infants were burned to
death after an angry crowd set fire to their parent's home because
they believed the couple was involved in witchcraft, police said
Tuesday.
   Police in the tribal homeland of Venda near Zimbabwe said a
2-year-old boy and his 7-month-old brother died in the incident
Monday night. Police said the crowd attacked and burned the house
Monday night, and the parents were unable to rescue the sleeping
children from the flames.
   ``The parents, who are alleged to have been practitioners of
witchcraft, could not rescue their children in the menacing fire,''
the South African Press Association said.
   Fighting between people allegedly involved in withcraft and
their opponents left 19 people dead this month in Venda, police
said. Venda is one of four nominally independent homelands set up
by South Africa for blacks.

<HEAD>Prison Authorities Get Power to Administer Anti-Psychotic Drugs</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 3 grafs after 8th graf, Stevens, writing, with
Washington reaction; Picks up 9th graf pvs: Ruling in...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today gave prison officials
sweeping power to force inmates to take anti-psychotic drugs.
   The 6-3 ruling in a Washington state case is a victory for
prison officials and doctors who say they, and not judges, should
decide when such powerful, behavior-modifying drugs are
administered.
   The justices said prisoners are not entitled to court hearings
or other due-process safeguards before they must take the
medication.
   ``Given the requirements of the prison environment,'' Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court, the state may ``treat a
prison inmate who has a serious mental illness with anti-psychotic
drugs against his will if the inmate is dangerous to himself or
others and the treatment is in the inmate's medical interest.''
   The decision as to whether to use the drugs in such
circumstances is best left to prison officials and psychiatrists,
not judges, Kennedy said.
   Kennedy was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, Sandra Day O'Connor and
Antonin Scalia.
   Justices John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall dissented.
   Stevens, writing for the dissenters, said the court mistakenly
``has concluded that a mock trial before an institutionally biased
tribunal constitutes due process of law. A competent individual's
right to refuse psychotropic medication is an aspect of liberty
requiring the highest order of (constitutional) protection.''
   Washington Corrections Secretary Chase Riveland said the
decision was an important one but doesn't mean his department will
go on a medication binge.
   ``I'm not suggesting that we should be willy nilly running
around medicating people. We need to be sure that people have
appropriate input into the medication that they're taking,'' he
said.
   ``There have been abuses historically in the country, not
necessarily in prison only, but in general. I think that ...if
medically appropriate it's very helpful,'' Riveland said.
   Ruling in a separate case today, however, the Supreme Court said
that people held against their will at state mental hospitals
without receiving legally required hearings may sue state officials
in federal court for monetary damages.
   The justices voted 5-4 to reverse lower-court decisions
involving a Florida man who was held in a state hospital for five
months without a hearing that state law requires within 48 hours.
   And in another case, the Supreme Court decided 9-0 that the
Boeing Co. did not violate a federal conflict-of-interest law when
the defense contractor paid $485,000 in severance to five employees
who left to take government jobs. The justices overturned a ruling
that the money must be turned over to the government.
   In the inmate case, the high court overturned a Washington State
Supreme Court ruling in 1988 that convicted robber Walter Harper,
diagnosed as schizophrenic, must be given a court hearing before
anti-psychotic drugs are administered to him.
   The state court also said prison officials must show a
compelling state interest to give him the medication and show that
the drugs will be effective.
   The state's compelling interest can be demonstrated by a need to
preserve life, to protect others who might be harmed by Harper, to
prevent his suicide and to maintain ``the ethical integrity of the
medical profession,'' the state court said.
   Harper was imprisoned in 1976, and for most part over the next
four years was in a mental health unit where he agreed to take
anti-psychotic drugs.
   He was paroled in 1980 on condition he continue receiving
psychiatric care.
   His parole was revoked after he attacked two nurses at Saint
Cabrini Hospital in Seattle.
   Back in prison, Harper at first agreed to take anti-psychotic
drugs. But in November 1982 he refused to take the medication any
longer, complaining it was poisoning his brain and causing other
side effects.
   A committee of prison officials decided he should be given the
drugs against his will for his own good and to control his violent
behavior.
   Harper sued. The state Supreme Court, calling the drugs as
intrusive as electro-shock therapy, ruled that an inmate who has
not been found mentally incompetent has a right to determine what
should be done to his own body.
   While the drugs are beneficial to seriously ill patients, they
also can have serious side effects ranging from involuntary spasms
to permanent brain damage.
   Those who support the rights of mental patients and prisoners
say there has been widespread abuse in prescribing anti-psychotic
drugs. They have called for tighter control of doctors and public
health officials.
   They also argue that inmates like Harper, if need be, can be
restrained physically or placed in isolation rather than forced to
take drugs continually.
   But public health and law enforcement officials say it makes
little sense to give an irrational or mentally disturbed person the
right to veto sensible medical practices.
   The U.S. Supreme Court previously had given mental health
authorities and prison officials wide latitude in treating and
controlling patients and inmates.
   While Harper's appeal was pending before the U.S. Supreme Court,
a law was enacted in Washington state that requires judicial
hearings for involuntary medication of mental patients except in
some emergencies. The new state law does not cover prison inmates.
   Courts in several states have ruled that mental patients who are
not legally incompetent have a right to refuse anti-psychotic drugs.
   But, according to some studies, judges in those states almost
always end up deciding that anti-psychotic drugs may be
administered against the individual's will after holding hearings
in individual cases.
   Kennedy noted today that the court was told Harper no longer is
refusing the medication.
   But Kennedy said because there is no evidence Harper has
recovered from his mental illness, treatment against his will may
have to be resumed in the future. Therefore, he said, the legal
controversy posed by the case is still alive.
   The case acted on today is Washington vs. Harper, 88-599.

<HEAD>French Reporter, Translator Ordered to Leave China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French television reporter and her translator
were ordered to leave China after conducting interviews without
permission in a sensitive minority region, an official report said
Tuesday.
   Daniele Loustallot of the French television network Antenne 2 is
the first foreign correspondent ordered to leave China under a new
press law that took effect last month. It requires visiting
reporters to obtain temporary accreditation from the government and
limits them to approved interviews.
   Ms. Loustallot and her translator, Fabienne Goldberg, were
working for the network's human rights program, ``Resistances,''
according to program spokesman Noel Mamere in Paris. He did not
give details of their planned report.
   The People's Daily newspaper said the two arrived Feb. 13 in the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, a vast, mostly Moslem area in
China's far northwest. They traveled on tourist visas.
   ``They conducted a series of illegal interviews and other
activities not compatible with their tourist status,'' the paper
said, without giving details. It said they ``ignored a warning by
the Public Security Bureau and had a rude and unreasonable
attitude.''
   It did not say what deadline was set for the women to leave
China. The French Embassy said they were still in the country
Tuesday, but refused to give other details.
   Xinjiang is sparsely populated by various minority groups,
including the Uygurs, who have clashed from time to time with
Chinese security forces over religious and cultural differences.
   Local authorities generally have treated foreign reporters with
suspicion, and last year police beat up two Beijing-based foreign
correspondents who believed they had permission to visit.
   Foreign journalists in Beijing have come under tighter
surveillance in recent weeks. However, Chinese Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen, in Geneva for a disarmament conference, said
journalists ``have great freedom, I think that perhaps the freedom
has been too extensive.''

<HEAD>Colombian Journalist, Three Peasants Killed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Two unidentified men shot and killed a
Colombian journalist and the three peasant farmers she was
interviewing at a restaurant in northern Cimitarra, an official
said today.
   Police were searching for the gunmen, who fled after slaying
Silvia Duzan and three members of a local agricultural cooperative
late Monday, said Mayor Salvador Pardo of the town, 75 miles north
of Bogota.
   He identified the three peasant farmers as Josue Vargas, Miguel
Barajas, and Saul Castaneda, and said they were directors of the
Carare Agricultural Workers Association.
   Duzan, a free-lance journalist, was working on a story on
right-wing death squads active in the area, according to the
Caracol national radio network. It was not immediately clear who
she was working for.
   Peasants have said the death squads were responsible for
massacres of peasants and leftist leaders in the region. Four years
ago, 36 peasants were found slain in the region. Half of them had
been decapitated.
   Duzan was the sister of Maria Jimena Duzan, a columnist for
Bogota's El Espectador newspaper who writes about drug traffickers
and the right-wing death squads they finance in areas they own land.
   She is the 49th journalist to be assassinated in Colombia since
1977. Since last August, when the government intensified a
crackdown on drug traffickers, 14 media employees have been killed.
Authorities have said that many of the assassinations were
contracted by traffickers.

<HEAD>Soviet Double Agent Describes Escape Under KGB Surveillance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A KGB agent who worked for the British for 13
years says he escaped his country by pretending to go on his daily
jog in Moscow and catching a train to the Finnish border.
   Oleg Gordievsky, who described his flight to the West in a
BBC-TV interview broadcast Monday, also said some of the British
spy scandals that have made headlines were baseless and damaging.
   ``It was a waste of time, waste of resources, waste of paper _
all those articles were published,'' the former spy said. ``There
was great damage and the public morale and the trust to the
intelligence security services in Western countries was impaired.
It was a pity. It was totally unnecessary.''
   Gordievsky said Sir Roger Hollis, who headed Britain's MI5
counterespionage service from 1956 to 1965, was not a Soviet agent.
   Writer Chapman Pincher and former MI5 officer Peter Wright,
whose book ``Spycatcher'' the British government failed to suppress
after lengthy court battles, have alleged the late Hollis was
almost certainly a Soviet spy.
   Pincher, responding to Gordievsky's remarks, said the KGB
restricted information about high-level double agents and that
Gordievsky would have been too junior to have known.
   Gordievsky said he was in a position to know if the KGB had
recruited high-level agents like Hollis.
   ``It was inconceivable really not to know if there had been such
an important agent of KGB. If a person like him had been KGB agent,
the people would have gossiped,'' Gordievsky said. ``There would
have been some indication in the files; there were no signs of it
at all.''
   Gordievsky began to work for the British in Copenhagen in the
early 1970s after becoming disillusioned with the Soviets,
particularly after the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   He was transferred to London where he became one of the top KGB
agents in Britain. He first learned that the Soviets were
suspicious of his activities in 1979 when a senior agent confronted
him and six other KGB members about intelligence leaks, he said.
   ``And of course I knew that I was the source of leaks,''
Gordievsky said. ``It demanded from me a tremendous self-control
and concentration not to reveal myself by body language, by a
gesture.''
   He said he was called to Moscow in 1985 under false pretenses
and then questioned about his activities. He revealed nothing
despite being drugged during interrogations, but knew he had to
escape.
   ``I was very worried two or three days later when I started to
recollect the whole content of the interrogation I realized that I
was under strong suspicion and my life was in great danger.''
   He would not speak of the contacts that enabled him to escape,
but described how he stuffed his sweatsuit with identification
papers and money, then set off on his daily jog past KGB
surveillance.
   Gordievsky ran to the Moscow-Leningrad rail station where he got
a train west to the Finnish border and defected. He would not say
how he achieved the crossing.
   He said his only regret was that he had to leave his wife,
Leila, and two daughters.
   ``I didn't betray the country, I didn't betray the people of the
Soviet Union. ... I think I betrayed the regime and the Soviet
Communist system which was illegitimate, wrong, and in many periods
of the Soviet history, even criminal,'' he said.
   Gordievsky, wearing a tweed jacket and smoking a pipe, smiled
easily and spoke quietly in slightly accented but very good English.
   ``I feel myself quite well integrated into British society. In
many aspects I am like a normal British citizen with similar habits
and customs. For example the greatest Sunday pleasure is to spend
the morning reading Sunday newspapers, sometimes in bed.
   ``And even, I never could have expected it from me, myself, but
I have developed an interest for gardening,'' he said.

   A man shot and killed one person and
critically wounded another in a downtown restaurant early this
morning and was himself shot to death by police, authorities said.
   It happened shortly after 4 a.m. at the 4B's Restaurant in this
west-central Montana town of 35,000, police said.
   ``Some kind of an argument started, we don't know what about,''
said Police Chief Don Millhouse said. ``Shortly thereafter he
produced a weapon and fired at employees and patrons.''
   The man was confronted by officers after he left the restaurant
and was shot when he pointed his gun at the officers and refused
orders to drop it, Millhouse said.
   Paul Richards, a Boulder resident staying overnight about half a
block from the restaurant, was awakened by the commotion.
   ``The first thing I heard was the police yelling, `Freeze!''
Richards said. ``There was some type of guttural response ... then
pop, pop, real quick shots.''
   Richards said he quickly dressed and went out to see what was
happening.
   ``I saw them loading one wounded (person) into an ambulance, and
the guy was dead out there in the street,'' Richards said. ``There
was a pistol near the dead person's body.''
   The wounded person was taken to St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula
and was in critical condition, Millhouse said.
   The police chief said that the names of those involved would not
be released until after relatives were notified.

   Some American students hope they'll make the
right moves during a trip to the Soviet Union next month.
   Ten students from Petal Middle School, ages 11 to 13, will
participate in a special checkers tournament during the
International Peace Conference.
   The trip is the idea of Charles Walker, founder and director of
the International Checkers Hall of Fame in Petal, a small town near
Hattiesburg.
   During their two-week trip, the students also will attend the
Pioneer Palace school for the gifted in Moscow.
   The wife of the director of the Russian Draughts Association
teaches at the Pioneer Palace school, which sponsors the annual
Peace Conference. This is how the union of peace was born between
checkers _ the American version of the British game of Draughts _
and the Russian version of Draughts, said Carolyn Lucas, secretary
of the International Checkers Hall of Fame.
   While at Pioneer Palace, students will compose a peace book of
essays, poems and drawings and put handprints in a cement memorial,
Lucas said.
   Teacher Debra Herrin has been preparing her students during and
after school.
   In addition to honing their checkers-playing skills, Herrin
said, the students are learning Russian phrases such as ``hello,
goodbye, where's the bathroom _ the things you really need.''

   Who will speak for the purple loosestrife?
   Nobody in his right mind, one weed expert said Monday after the
state Senate approved a legislation to kill the bushy garden flower
with herbicides and ban its sale or use. The bill now goes to the
House.
   ``It's a nightmare spreading across Washington,'' Rick Johnson
said of the European weed, which is choking wetlands across the
northern United States. Johnson is Thurston County's noxious-weed
control coordinator
   Each stalk of the pesky plant contains maybe a million seeds,
800,000 of which are viable.
   The bill provides $1 million to eradicate purple loosestrife.
Other states have banned or placed restrictions on its sale.
   State Rep. Marlin Appelwick said he had some concerns about the
portion of the bill that would make it illegal to sell or use
purple loosestrife plants or seeds. Violators could be fined $100,
and that includes backyard gardeners, Senate staffers said.
   ``We'll probably do more for the underground purple loosestrife
market than anything,'' Appelwick said, imagining basements crammed
with grow lights and rows of purple plants.

<TEXT>
   Indians voted in balloting for eight
state legislatures today, and at least 62 people were killed in
election day violence despite unprecedented security, news agencies
reported.
   The dead included an independent candidate who was shot in
eastern Bihar state, United News of India said.
   The elections were considered important for the governing
National Front, the Congress Party of former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi, and Hindu fundamentalists.
   In Bihar, notorious for organized criminal gangs that operate
during elections, at least 60 people were killed, including the
independent candidate shot by unidentified gunmen in Biharsharif,
United News said. The election in that town was expected to be
invalidated.
   Two people were killed in the western state of Gujarat, Press
Trust of India said, but no details were immediately available.
   At least 250 people were injured in the eight states, police
said.
   About 150 million of the 213 million eligible voters cast
ballots in elections today for 1,610 members of the eight
legislatures, all of which were controlled by Gandhi's Congress
Party.
   First results were not expected until late Wednesday.
   Authorities deployed more than 45,000 federal troops to oversee
the elections. Before today, campaign violence had claimed at least
13 lives in the eight states, 11 of them in Bihar.
   The New Delhi-based Hindustan Times newspaper said the elections
were held under ``what is regarded as the tightest-ever security
ever in view of the increasing incidence of poll violence and booth
capturing.''
   The term ``booth capturing'' covers an array of fraud ranging
from stuffing the ballot boxes to intimidation.
   The Election Commission said police have been given
shoot-on-sight orders in an effort to control vote fraud.
   Today, in Bihar's Bahadur village, police shot and killed three
people when they opened fire to stop the stuffing of ballot boxes,
United News said. Elsewhere in the state, 57 poeple were killed in
bomb blasts and clashes, the news agency said.
   The elections are considered a test of the Congress Party's
waning popularity and the rising voter appeal of the Indian
People's Party.
   The People's Party, a right-wing Hindu fundamentalist group,
registered massive gains in November's national election when it
won 88 seats, compared with two in the 1984 polls.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh's National Front, which ousted
Gandhi's Congress Party, won 141 seats in the national election but
formed the government only after the Indian People's Party extended
its support.
   Gandhi's party won 193 seats. The policy-making lower house of
the parliament has 544 seats.
   Today's elections were to decide which party, or coalition, will
govern the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan,
Gujarat, Orissa, Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh and the
federally adminstered territory of Pondicherry for five years.
India has 25 states.
   There were 21,265 candidates vying for 1,611 seats in the states.
   The election was crucial for the Indian People's Party. Analysts
have linked the party's showing in the last national election to
the revival of Hindu fundamentalism.
   About 82 percent of India's 880 million people are Hindus, but
they traditionally have voted for the Congress Party.

<HEAD>Israel, Poland Resume Diplomatic Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel and Poland resumed full diplomatic
relations after a 23-year break Tuesday, the third Warsaw Pact
country to renew relations with the Jewish state in the past six
months.
   Poland ended relations in 1967 to support the Arab side in the
Middle East War. Hungary restored relations in September and
Czechoslovakia followed suit Feb. 9.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki looked on as Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens and Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof
Skubiszewski signed the protocal at a government palace, and the
delegations sipped champagne to celebrate the long-awaited event.
   Poland has had low-level ties with Israel since 1987 and the new
Solidarity-led government is hoping that the restoration of a
formal embassy will lead to closer economic and cultural
cooperation.
   ``We are today opening a new chapter in the long history, full
of tragedies, of the Jewish people of Poland,'' Arens told Israel
Army Radio. ``I hope for good and close relations between Israel
and Poland.''
   Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Arens stressed that
Israel also hopes for Polish support for Israeli positions in the
Middle East peace process.
   He later told Israel Army Radio he found ``great understanding''
for Israel's problems among Poland's leaders. ``It seems even a
greater and fuller understanding than we have found in Western
Europe,'' he added.
   Poland has said resuming relations with Israel should not
disturb its relations with Arab countries. Poland continues to
endorse Palestinian rights to self-determination, and Skubiszewski
held a January meeting with Arab diplomats to assure continued
support.
   Nevertheless, state radio in Libya said it had ``deep regret''
over the resumption of relations. The Polish ambassador to Tripoli
was summoned to the Libyan Foreign Ministry and told that the
action would harm Libyan-Polish relations and Arab-Polish relations
generally, the Libyan radio report said.
   Arens, in the radio interview, said he had invited Polish
President Wojciech Jaruzelski to Israel. The invitation was
accepted but no date was set, he said.
   Skubiszewski also said he, too, had accepted an invitation to
Israel.
   Arens said he expected resuming diplomatic ties will lead to
``very extensive economic relations'' between Israel and Poland, as
well as closer people-to-people links.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that it will bring about a
widening, a deepening and a strengthening of the relationship
between the Polish people and the Jewish people in Poland and
Israel,'' Arens said.
   He referred to the small community of about 10,000 Jews
remaining in Poland after the Holocaust and massive postwar
emigration of Polish Jews, mainly to Israel and the United States.
   On Monday, Arens went on emotional visits to memorials to
Poland's once vibrant Jewish community, which numbered 3.5 million
before World War II.
   He paid homage at the monument to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of
1943, when Jews, held in a walled-in section of the city to face
starvation or deportation, rose up against the Nazi occupiers.
   Arens stood in silence at the monument at Umschlagplatz, the
depot where 300,000 Warsaw Jews were loaded on trains to the Nazi
concentration camps.
   On Tuesday, Arens also discussed economic issues with Polish
Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, met with Mazowiecki and had a
session scheduled with Jaruzelski, who was Communist Party leader
when the then-Communist government initiated contacts with Israel.
   Arens commended Poland's leadership in the democratization of
the East bloc during a Monday dinner toast and said there was a
clear relationship with the readiness to improve ties with Israel.
   ``It is remembered in Israel that Poland was the first country
in the Soviet bloc to start the process of improving relations with
Israel. It took great courage,'' he said.
   Between 350,000 to 500,000 Israelis were born in Poland,
including the first Israeli prime minister, David Ben Gurion, and
the present one, Yitzhak Shamir.

   State education officials hastily decided
today to scrap questions about Eastern Europe on a sixth-grade
social studies test instead of asking pupils to pretend the Cold
War is still raging.
   The questions will ``be replaced as quickly as possible and we
will send a new instructions to the teachers,'' said Glenn Keever,
spokesman for the Department of Public Instruction. He said top
officials in the department had been unaware of what the test
administrators had done.
   ``We will have two other questions that will be drawn from
another test that are current in terms of present conditions in
eastern Europe,'' Keever said.
   The Charlotte Observer reported this morning that instead of
rewriting the 3-year-old standardized tests, the state education
department was instructing teachers to tell pupils to answer the
questions as if Eastern Europe hadn't changed since 1987.
   ``It is a perfect illustration of the frailty of relying on
standardized multiple-choice tests,'' said John Dornan, executive
director of Public School Forum, a non-profit education think tank
in Raleigh.
   ``For the teacher who's really passionate about teaching current
events, this is really a disincentive, and that's tragic.''
   About 80,000 sixth-graders will take the 60-question State
Social Studies Test, used to rank and accredit schools, in March
and April. Third- and eighth-graders take different versions _
which don't happen to contain any questions about Eastern Europe.
The sixth-grade version developed three years ago has two such
questions, officials said.
   The two old questions were:
   _ ``In an election, for which candidates are citizens of the
Soviet Union expected to vote? A: Candidates of their choice, B:
Only male candidates over 35 years of age, C: Candidates selected
by the Communist Party, D: Candidates who have opposed the
Communist Party.''
   _ ``Which of these countries has a democratic government? A:
Albania, B: Cuba, C: United States, D: Poland.''
   Before the revolutionary changes started sweeping Eastern
Europe, ``C'' would be the best choice for both questions. It's a
little more complicated now.
   The Charlotte Observer reported that the state Department of
Public Instruction had told teachers to instruct their
sixth-graders: ``Do not think about or consider the recent
governmental changes that have occurred in the last few months when
you choose your answers for the questions about Eastern Europe.
Think about how Eastern Europe was in 1987.'' Those words are taken
from the written instructions sent to sixth-grade teachers to read
to the pupils. The instructions were dated January 1990.
   Keever said the scrapping of the questions was ordered by Roger
Jackson, deputy state school superintendent. State Superintendent
of Public Instruction Bobby Etheridge and other top officials
didn't know about the incorrect questions until today when they
were reported in the newspaper, he said.

   The Foreign Ministry has admitted it has found
copies of the secret protocol of the 1939 Soviet-Nazi pact that
allotted the three independent Baltic nations and part of Poland to
the Soviet Union.
   Vestnik, a new Soviet magazine published by the Foreign
Ministry, showed photographs in its premier edition that came out
on Monday of a typewritten Russian-language copy of the ``Secret
Additional Protocol.''
   The Soviet Union has maintained it could not find any evidence
of the protocols in its archives and still says it does not have
the originals.
   Last summer, Soviet publications printed German-language copies
of the protocols kept in the archives of the West German Foreign
Ministry.
   Also last summer, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev supported
the creation of a commission to investigate claims there was such a
protocol. He said at the time that no documents had been found to
confirm the existence of the protocol.
   The protocol was signed by Stalin's foreign minister, Vyacheslav
Molotov, and Hitler's top diplomat, Joachim von Ribbentrop on Aug.
23, 1939, a week before the outbreak of World War II.
   The document placed the independent countries of Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania and parts of eastern Poland in the Soviet sphere of
influence and was the basis of Stalin's decision later to annex
that territory to the Soviet Union.
   The Baltic republics succeeded in winning Soviet government
recognition of the existence of the protocols last year.
   The magazine also published a statement by one of Molotov's
aides confirming the original had been handed over to another aide
_ another confirmation of the existence of the originals.
   Vestnik, a joint venture between the Soviet Union and Austria,
is edited in Moscow and printed in Vienna and costs $75 a year for
the monthly publication.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Says No Way to Increase Revenues as Bush Asks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House's chief tax writer said Tuesday he
sees ``absolutely no way'' to increase tax collections next year by
the $13.9 billion President Bush is proposing.
   The remarks by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., further dimmed the prospects that Congress
and the Bush administration will quickly forge a deficit-reduction
plan for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   Meanwhile, Rostenkowski's panel voted to urge the Budget
Committee to take the surpluses of the Social Security trust fund
out of budget deficit calculations, a move that would greatly
worsen the federal deficit problem on paper.
   As part of his plan to find $37.5 billion in deficit reductions
next year, Bush last month proposed increasing tax receipts by
$13.9 billion. The administration estimates that cutting the
capital gains tax would increase revenue by $4.9 billion, with the
rest coming from greater Internal Revenue Service efficiency and
increases in several minor taxes.
   Democratic leaders of the House and Senate budget committees
have said they oppose the ingredients of Bush's plan, especially
the rate cut on capital gains taxes, which they say would mainly
benefit the wealthy. They have said they might try to produce a
budget of their own containing the same amount of new revenue _
$13.9 billion _ but with a different mix.
   But Rostenkowski told his panel such a tack would prove
unworkable.
   ``I see absolutely no way we can raise $14 billion, and that's
the direction the Budget Committee is taking us,'' he said.
   The Illinois Democrat said that if his committee is told to find
$14 billion in new taxes, ``We're just not that good a magician,
unless we become very serious about reaching out for revenues that
are certainly going to be ducks.''
   The word ``ducks'' was a reference to White House budget
director Richard Darman's statement last year that Bush's pledge of
``no new taxes'' applies to any levies the public would perceive as
taxes. He used the expression that if something walks and talks
like a duck, it's a duck.
   Bush has repeatedly promised to veto increases in such taxes.
Congress' Democratic leaders have said that, therefore, they will
propose no tax increases that will provoke a veto and leave their
party as the sole advocate of higher taxes.
   The Ways and Means panel voted Tuesday by voice, against
Rostenkowski, to ask that Social Security trust fund surpluses be
removed from deficit calculations.
   Supporters of the proposal, sponsored by Rep. Byron Dorgan,
D-N.D., said the surpluses make the federal deficit appear smaller.
The public thus feels less urgency to address the problem, they
said.
   It was the first congressional vote of the year on the issue,
which has been a focus of attention on Capitol Hill since Sen.
Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., proposed cutting the Social Security
payroll tax.
   Opponents _ mainly Republicans _ said Dorgan's plan would force
Congress to find tens of billions of dollars in extra savings each
year to meet the declining annual deficit targets of the
Gramm-Rudman law.
   Rostenkowski said he might eventually support Dorgan's proposal.
But he opposed it Tuesday, saying he first wanted to discuss the
matter with the budget panel.
   The Social Security trust fund will have a surplus next year of
$74 billion, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. Counting
that infusion of money, the White House projects the 1991 deficit
at $101 billion, not including the savings Bush has proposed.

<HEAD>East German Party Supported by Kohl Seeks Delay in Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small party backed by West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Tuesday the East German elections
should be postponed because voting rules were not available in time
to permit fair competition.
   The German Social Union told the Supreme Court its chances and
those of other small parties were hurt because national newspapers
did not publish procedures for the March 18 ballot, the first free
election in East Germany's 40-year history.
   Parliament approved the regulations a week ago in the form of a
lengthy voting law, which was printed and made available at
bookstores Friday. It set Monday as the deadline for parties to
notify the national election committee if they planned to run
candidates.
   Representatives of the German Social Union, known as the DSU by
its German initials, got a copy of the law from the election
committee Friday and were able to register before the deadline.
   Its complaint to the court said newly formed parties had too
little chance to prepare candidate lists for the 400 Parliament
seats, which must be given to the committee by Wednesday, and asked
that the vote be delayed at least until early May.
   Elections originally were scheduled for May 6, but the German
Social Union and other parties pressed the Communist-led interim
government to move the date up, partly from fear the economy would
collapse before May.
   Some larger parties, including the Communists, have political
networks with offices, telephones, vehicles and other advantages
not available to new groups that have sprung up since the
pro-democracy movement began last fall.
   Even so, the clear leader is the Social Democratic Party,
founded less than five months ago and supported by the sister party
that is West Germany's main opposition.
   Polls of East German voters predict the Social Democrats will
get at least 50 percent of the vote March 18.
   Kohl's Christian Democratic Union supports the German Social
Union, East German Christian Democratic Union and Democratic
Awakening, which are joined in a conservative alliance.
   Thousands of East Germans cheered Kohl at a rally last week in
Erfurt, but it was no match for the emotional welcome given former
Chancellor Willy Brandt at a weekend rally of Social Democrats in
Leipzig.
   Putting off the election would give the smaller parties a fairer
chance, said Joachim Novak, deputy chairman of the German Social
Union.
   ``We have argued from the beginning that it is unfair for the
new parties to have to compete against organized forces so soon,''
he said.
   ``As a minimum, the regulations should have been published in
the newspapers. Failure to distribute the procedural information
broadly is clearly a violation of the constitution.''
   East German newspapers remain technically under government
control, although they have undergone great changes since the
hard-line leadership of Erich Honecker was ousted in October. None
published the text of the election law.
   Many government offices and enterprises have virtually halted
operations until the elections allow plans for economic rescue and
German reunification to proceed.
   West Germany has offered to make its Deutschmark the official
currency of both Germanys, but only after a democratically elected
government is in power and laws are rewritten to foster conversion
to a free-market economy.

   The suspended landlord of nearly 350 federally
subsidized housing projects told a congressional panel today that
he tried repeatedly to improve conditions at problem developments
but was denied help by government officials.
   ``HUD's administration and oversight of inner-city problem
housing has been abysmal and verges on the criminal,'' said A.
Bruce Rozet, who was recently suspended from any new Department of
Housing and Urban Development work because of questions about past
management of a handful of projects.
   ``They have condemned tenants to live in squalor while pleading
the poverty of the government and trying to shift the blame,''
Rozet said, accusing HUD of trying to shift the blame for faulty
housing programs.
   ``They have raised the hopes of poor inner-city residents with
rhetoric and promises of action and then dashed their hopes on the
anvil of purported reform and miserly budgets.''
   Rozet is locked in a bitter battle with HUD and Secretary Jack
Kemp, who last month suspended Rozet's Associated Financial Corp.,
or AFC, and a web of affiliates from any new department contracts.
   Several Kemp aides were on hand for the hearing by the House
Banking subcommittee on housing, and on occasion scribbled
questions on note paper and shuttled them to Republican lawmakers.
   Subcommittee mmbers had dozens of questions about the suspension
and the condition of the nearly 45,000 units at developments owned
or partly controlled by the California-based companies. The panel
said it planned to call Rozet back after hearing from HUD officials
and tenants of some AFC-related properties.
   The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
said it was clear that inconsistent policies at HUD and high
turnover had at least contributed to problems plaguing developments
controlled by private groups such as Rozet's.
   He said he wanted to call HUD officials to see to what extent
the agency's ``hands were dirtied,'' but then added to Rozet: ``I'm
not too sure about yours.''
   Rozet said he welcomed the review. He predicted the panel would
agree with his contention that HUD should shoulder most of the
blame for poor conditions, a position he supported by referring to
several cases in which he said HUD had ignored or rejected
renovation plans his company or affiliates presented.
   Most of those cases were before Kemp took office last year.
Rozet, a prominent Democratic fund-raiser, said his company perhaps
would have fared better had he hired Republican consultants _ a
reference to past congressional testimony of rampant
influence-peddling at HUD during the tenure of Kemp's predecessor,
Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
   But Rozet also intensified his attacks on Kemp, saying that HUD
has done nothing under his leadership to improve housing.
   HUD issued the suspension after alleging that AFC's management
affiliate, Housing Resources Management, misused government and
tenant funds at developments in Oklahoma and the District of
Columbia.
   A HUD memo indicated the department's inspector general is
working with the FBI to investigate whether the company overbilled
for rent subsidies in Oklahoma.
   Kemp, in answer to earlier Rozet criticisms, has defended the
suspension and denied Rozet's contention it was politically
motivated.
   Rozet, in an interview earlier this month, said the company had
ample evidence to refute the allegations but had been denied a HUD
hearing. Because of the suspension, Rozet said AFC and its
affiliates were seeking to relinquish control over most of the
nearly 350 properties they manage in 40 states and Puerto Rico.
   In his statement today before the Banking Committee's housing
subcommittee, Rozet said only a small number of AFC's properties
are troubled and that most were acquired in late 1986 after HUD
promised to help revitalize the developments. But HUD has reneged,
he said.
   ``The one thing HUD cannot do _ and Congress cannot let them do
_ is to make no decision and turn their back on the problem,''
Rozet said, accusing Kemp's HUD of ignoring provisions of federal
housing law that require the agency to try to help troubled housing
developments.
   He said a legislative package passed last year at Kemp's request
gave the secretary new powers to penalize housing owners the
department blames for poor conditions.
   ``Has HUD obtained the legal right to stab the owner in the back
and then fine him for bleeding on the carpet?'' Rozet asked.

<HEAD>Senate, White House Pushing Toward Agreement on Clean-Air Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate and White House negotiators moved
closer Tuesday to agreement on how to reduce smog-causing
automobile emissions, sources said, as private talks resumed on a
compromise clean-air bill.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell reiterated that he
intends to bring the bill to a floor test on Thursday even if a
compromise package is not reached with the Bush administration.
   Disagreements over pollution controls on automobiles, especially
toughened tailpipe controls, have been a focus of much of the
private discussions between key senators and senior administration
officials over the last three weeks.
   A daylong round of closed-door negotiations that lasted well
into the early hours of Tuesday produced tentative agreements on a
number of areas, including increased pollution controls on toxic
and smog-causing industrial emissions and on an alternative fuels
program.
   At the same time, the negotiators agreed to jettison a proposal
sought by environmentalists that would have required automakers to
sharply increase their cars' fuel economy, according to sources
close to the talks. The provision, aimed at concerns about global
warming, would have required controls on carbon dioxide emissions
from cars. Automakers had lobbied vigorously against it.
   At the same time, differences were narrowed on how to cut
smog-causing pollutants from automobiles, including agreement for
the first time by White House negotiators on conditions for
imposing a second round of nationwide tailpipe emission controls,
according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The sources emphasized that details remained to be worked out on
when such toughened controls would kick in nationwide. President
Bush has insisted that the tightened automobile pollution controls,
a key element in the Senate bill to curb urban smog, were too
expensive. Automakers have argued the new standards could not be
met with current technology.
   The negotiators met past midnight Monday and resumed the talks
Tuesday, focusing first on acid rain controls and then again on the
automobile emissions questions.
   Mitchell began the talks with the administration Feb. 2 in an
effort to enlist White House support for a compromise bill. He
acknowledged that the tougher legislation approved by the Senate
Environment and Pubilc Works Committee last November had
encountered strong regional opposition and was sure to face a
filibuster on the Senate floor.
   The legislation would be the first revision of the federal clean
air law in 13 years.
   Senate leaders and the administration were generally in
agreement over the acid rain provisions of the bill, which call for
coal-burning electric utilities to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions
by 10 million tons a year.
   But those acid rain controls have been opposed by a group of
Midwest senators who seek a cost-sharing provision to help pay for
installing expensive pollution controls at some of the dirtiest
utility plants.
   At the same time, other senators from states where plants are
relatively clean have opposed any such cost sharing and sought
assurances instead that the controls will not hinder future growth.
   While both the White House and Mitchell are opposed to any
national energy tax or fee to help pay for the pollution controls,
the negotiations on acid rain have centered on trying to
accommodate the various regional concerns, sources said.

   A 14-month-old boy whose head was trapped
in a toy box died despite resuscitation efforts by his mother and a
mailman.
   ``I heard her scream and saw the mother running across two lawns
carrying the baby in her arms,'' mailman Ernest Wilkes said after
Monday's accident that killed Seth Everett.
   ``She was screaming, `Help me! My baby is dead!'''
   Carol Everett had just extricated her son from a footlocker that
served as a toy box, where the child had been playing with his
3-year-old brother.
   Wilkes carried the toddler into the house and placed him on a
table, where first he and then the mother administered
cardiopulmonary resuscitation to try to get him to breath.
   ``I never saw a bit of life in the child,'' said Wilkes. ``I
wish I could have done something.''
   A firefighter responding to a 911 call also failed to revive the
boy.
   Police Lt. Dave Andrews said the lid apparently came down on the
boy's head, trapping the child between the lid and the box.

   Richard Widmark, one of Hollywood's most durable
stars, received the D.W. Griffith Career Achievement Award for his
40 years in films.
   The 75-year-old Widmark was presented the award at a ceremony
Monday night from Sidney Poitier, who appeared with him in the 1952
movie, ``No Way Out.'' The award was given by the National Board of
Review of Motion Pictures.
   Widmark got his start in radio in the 1940s in New York, then
appeared in several Broadway plays.
   His screen debut in the 1947 thriller ``Kiss of Death'' is still
considered his most famous role. He received an Oscar nomination
for that role _ a psychopathic killer with a chilling laugh who
pushed an old woman in a wheelchair down a flight of stairs.
   Some of his other films include ``Street with No Name,'' ``Panic
in the Streets,'' ``Halls of Montezuma,'' ``The Cobweb,'' ``The Law
and Jake Wade,'' ``Judgment at Nuremberg,'' ``How the West Was
Won,'' ``Death of a Gunfighter,'' ``Coma'' and ``The Swarm.''
   He starred in the television series ``Madigan.''
   Other National Board of Review winners, announced in December,
were:
   _ Best movie: ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   _ Best actor: Morgan Freeman, ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   _ Best actress: Michelle Pfeiffer, ``The Fabulous Baker Boys.''
   _ Supporting actor: Alan Alda, ``Crimes and Misdemeanors.''

   Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said
Tuesday that a federal AIDS policy is ``almost 10 years overdue.''
   Koop also told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that he
was alarmed at a growing ``complacency about the AIDS epidemic,''
which he said is overburdening big-city hospitals while spreading
to rural areas.
   Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House health and
environment subcommittee before which Koop testified, said
President Bush has yet to act on groundwork laid when Koop was
surgeon general under President Reagan.
   ``Having missed the opportunity to get the ounce of prevention,
we now have to pay for the pounds and pounds of cure,'' said
Waxman, who was hearing testimony on his proposed legislation to
expand Medicaid coverage for people with AIDS or infected with the
HIV virus believed to cause the disease.
   Although Koop didn't speak as sharply as Waxman, he repeatedly
stated his disappointment with both Congress and the White House.
   ``There are ample opportunities'' for the White House and
Congress to develop an AIDS policy, Koop said. ``I think it's
almost 10 years overdue.''
   ``My concerns this morning have yet to be addressed at a
national level,'' said Koop. He said later, ``It seems incredible
that the federal government has not had a dialogue'' with state and
local governments and insurers.
   ``I also am disappointed to sense the amount of complacency
about the AIDS epidemic,'' he said, adding that official government
figures are probably underreported.
   Under Waxman's legislation, Medicaid coverage would include
early intervention with drugs such as AZT and aerosol pentamidine.
Those drugs are expensive _ $3,500 a year for AZT or $1,100 for
pentamidine, according to Waxman's staff, but the cost of
hospitalization is even higher _ $15,000 per admission.
   The bill would create a presumption of disability for people who
have the virus but who may not have developed the symptoms, making
it easier for them to qualify for the early intervention.
   Other provisions deal with reimbursements for care of people
already sick, including babies and children with AIDS.
   Koop said the complacency is due to three mistaken beliefs:
   _That the leveled-off projections for new cases _ 40,000 this
year as opposed to 35,000 recorded cases last year _ mean a
shrinking epidemic.
   _That because the spread is confined to black and Hispanic drug
users, the general population is less likely to be threatened.
   _That many believe the disease is not spread through
heterosexual contact.
   Koop said the epidemic is having its most serious impact on
big-city hospitals where more and more beds _ as many as 25 percent
in New York _ are occupied by AIDS victims.
   As a result, patients with other ailments wait too long for beds
to become available, medical and nursing students work elsewhere
because of fear of contagion and a lack of variety in the types of
patients, and budgets are drained because AIDS patients usually
have already exhausted their funds by the time they reach the
hospitsl, according to testimony.

<HEAD>Just Over Half on Poll Respondents Back Bush Approach in Drug War</HEAD>

   Just over half the respondents in a new survey
say they feel the Bush administration's law-enforcement approach to
the war on illegal drugs will reduce the country's drug problem.
   At the same time, slightly more than one-third say they favor
legalization for less serious drugs and an increase in drug
treatment and education programs.
   National drug control policy director William J. Bennett, who
has called legalization advocacy ``stupid and morally atrocious,''
dismissed the survey, saying some progress has been made in the war
on drugs.
   ``Now that we're starting to see some encouraging signs, why put
up the white flag?'' he rhetorically asked reporters at the White
House.
   The telephone poll of 1,401 adult Americans was done Jan.
24-Feb. 4 by Targeting Systems Inc. of Arlington, Va., for the Drug
Policy Foundation, which says it advocates treating drug abuse as a
health problem, not a criminal justice issue. The survey has a
margin of error of 3 percentage points.
   Richard J. Dennis of Chicago, chairman of the foundation's
Advisory Board, paid for the survey.
   Among the poll's findings:
   _55 percent of the respondents said they believe the
administration's primarily law enforcement approach to the war on
drugs _ including more prison sentences for casual drug use, using
the military to fight drug trafficking and more money for prisons _
is likely to reduce the drug problem.
   _36 percent favor legalization of less serious drugs along with
an increase in drug treatment and education aid.
   _Asked if it was more important to take ``any step necessary''
in order to stop drug use than to protect civil liberties, 71
percent chose taking ``any step necessary.''
   _Fewer than 2 percent said they might try cocaine if it were
legalized, but 60 percent say they think cocaine use would go up if
it were no longer a crime. Ten percent said cocaine use would
decrease if it were legalized and 27 percent said it would stay the
same.
   _9.6 percent said they might try marijuana if it were legalized,
while 50 percent said marijuana use would increase if it were not a
crime. Twelve percent said it would decrease and 37 percent said it
would stay the same.
   _Given the choice between providing treatment and counseling for
drug users or punishing them with fines and imprisonment, 68
percent favored treatment and 21 percent favored punishment.
   _61 percent said all drug use is immoral and should be illegal,
while 35 percent disagreed with that view.
   _As for medical uses of some prohibited drugs, 76 percent said
doctors should be allowed to prescribe heroin as a painkiller for
terminally ill cancer patients, while 69 percent said physicians
should be allowed to prescribe marijuana as a treatment for
glaucoma.

   Conventional wisdom took almost as bad a
beating in Nicaragua as President Daniel Ortega.
   One of the most profoundly held views of the Reagan
administration, for example, was that Ortega could never be counted
on to hold a free and fair election.
   The perception of Ortega as an anti-democrat guided every policy
decision concerning Nicaragua that the administration took. The
notion that Ortega would hold a fair election and agree to turn
over power if he lost was laughable, a tall tale belonging on the
fiction shelf.
   Several years ago, one official who had the audacity to suggest
that Ortega was a moderate in the Sandinista political context was
looked on almost as a subversive by administration hardliners. He
was banished to appen after a Sandinista victory, giving the alternative
possibility short shrift.
   Their views, of course, were fed by the pollsters, who were
predicting a Sandinista victory in excess of 15 percentage points.
It is now obvious that a significant number of Nicaraguans gave the
``safe'' answer to the pollsters _ that they were pro-Sandinista.
In the privacy of the voting booth, they abandoned Ortega.
   One of the few who was not taken in by the pollsters was the
chief U.S. diplomat in Managua, Jack Leonard, who foresaw the
Chamorro victory weeks ago.
   The pollsters were no less off base than former Assistant
Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, who in an April 1987 speech
predicted disaster for Central America if military aid to the
Contras was cut off.
   Under Abrams' scenario, an aid suspension would enable the
Sandinistas to devote their attention to subverting other Central
American countries, leading to the eventual destruction of the
fledgling democracies in the region.
   To abandon the Contras ``is to follow a recipe for certain
disaster in the region within two years,'' he said.
   Abrams' grim scenario has not panned out. Military aid was
indeed cut off by the Congress. The date was two years ago this
week and instead of disaster befalling Nicaragua's neighbors, it
befell the Sandinistas themselves.

<HEAD>Irish Prime Minister Gets Camp David Invitation _ For Sure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whatever else Charles Haughey accomplished in
his meeting with President Bush Tuesday, the Irish prime minister
managed to wangle an invitation to Camp David.
   As the leaders posed for pictures in the Oval Office at the
outset of their meeting, Haughey was overheard telling his host,
``You must bring me up to Camp David sometime.''
   ``Absolutely,'' replied Bush. ``I think if you like the
outdoors, you'd love it. In the spring and the fall it is
wonderful.''
   Bush, as is his usual practice, refused to answer reporters'
questions during the photo opportunity. But when a reporter asked
for Haughey's views on German unification, Bush said, ``This is a
free country. You can ask him anything you want, but I don't know
whether he'll answer.''
   Haughey passed up the opportunity to explain his views, saying,
``I think the best thing I can do is take the good example of the
president of the United States of America.''
   But before the reporters and camera crews filed out, Haughey
seized the opportunity to make sure the Camp David invitation was
on the record.
   ``Are you really going to have me up to Camp David sometime
soon?'' Haughey asked again.
   ``Yes, in front of everybody, I'm answering your question: You
are welcome to come to Camp David sometime. We've got to do it when
it's a little warmer.''
   Camp David is the presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains
of Maryland, 75 miles outside Washington. Bush spends nearly every
weekend there and spent this past weekend there huddled with West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Haughey became prime minister as head of a coalition government
after Irish elections last June. He was prime minister in three
earlier governments.

   A package bomb exploded in the home of
judge whose court hears all terrorism cases, and he was seriously
wounded, the Interior Ministry said.
   Fernando de Mateo Lage, 70, who was opening the package,
underwent surgery at Gregorio Maranon hospital after the blast
severed his hands and hurled shrapnel into his stomach, chest and
face, doctors said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the bomb, which came less
than a week after the government indicated it would respond
favorably if armed Basque separatists would halt attacks for six
months.
   Mateo Lage has been president since 1986 of the Audiencia
Nacional, where all terrorism cases are tried.
   He worked at the same court as prosecutor Carmen Tagle, who was
shot to death last year in an ambush claimed by the Basque
separatist group ETA.
   ETA has killed more than 600 people in its violent, 21-year
campaign for independence for the northern, three-province Spanish
Basque region.
   ETA, whose initials stand for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, claimed responsibility for attacks that killed 17 people
last year. ETA-claimed actions have caused one death so far this
year.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders demanded
Tuesday that Defense Minister Magnus Malan be suspended and
directed to prove his allegation that an assassinated
anti-apartheid activist was an army spy.
   ``You have besmirched a hero,'' Denis Worrall, co-leader of the
Democratic Party, told Malan in Parliament. ``Not a single black
person in South Africa or Namibia believes you.''
   His party and the larger Conservative Party, which supports
apartheid, want Malan suspended until pending a judicial inquiry
into allegations that the Civil Cooperation Bureau, a secret
military intelligence unit, killed opponents of South Africa's
apartheid policy of race discrimination.
   Malan, defense minister since 1981, has denied ordering killings
or other criminal activity. More than 60 unsolved killings of
anti-apartheid activists have occurred in the past decade.
   South African and Namibian police are seeking three former
police officers who allegedly were recruited into a unit of the
military's Civil Cooperation Bureau.
   They have been missing since Namibian police issued warrants for
their arrest in the assassination in September 1989 of Anton
Lubowski, a lawyer who was the highest-ranking white member of the
South-West Africa People's Organization.
   SWAPO guerrillas fought a bush war against South African forces
in Namibia until April 1989. It won elections in November and will
control the government when the territory becomes independent in
March under U.N. supervision.
   On Monday, Malan declared in Parliament that Lubowski was ``a
paid agent of Military Intelligence'' who had done good work for
the army and there would have been no reason for the military
intelligence chief to have ordered action against him.
   Malan said he would make further comments only to the judicial
inquiry. Lubowski's family challenged him to repeat the allegation
outside the protection of parliamentary privilege.
   ``One of the reasons for this allegation is to create suspicion
of white SWAPO members,'' said Moses Garoeb, a SWAPO official. ``No
matter the extent of the smear campaign, the name of Anton Lubowski
will be remembered as a shining example of the struggle for
independence.''
   Worrall said in Parliament: ``Given the denial by the Lubowski
family and SWAPO, and the improbability of the suggestion that he
was a Military Intelligence agent, we are entitled to demand proof.
... If the man was paid, there must be bank acounts and evidence of
payments.''
   If Malan did not provide proof of his allegation, Worrall said,
he would ``simply be seen to be trying to save his own political
life.''
   The Star newspaper in Johannesburg, which has published several
articles showing the chain of command between Malan and the Civil
Cooperation Bureau, said Tuesday legal experts were shocked that
Malan had withheld evidence about Lubowski from police for five
months.
   Col. Jumbo Smit, the Namibian officer investigating the case,
said whether Lubowski worked for the South African army did not
matter to him. ``This is a murder case,'' he said, and the victim's
political affiliation or profession were not relevant.
   On Sunday, the Star said President F.W. de Klerk was ``expected
to fire'' Malan, whom it described as ``the last remnant of
ex-President P.W. Botha's securocrats.''
   It noted de Klerk had said in a television interview that
criminals, not the security forces, were under attack by those
making allegations about death squads. The Star said de Klerk's
comment appeared directed at statements by Malan that implied the
allegations were an attack on the Defense Force.
   The president, however, was one of several National Party
members of Parliament who shook Malan's hand after his statement
Monday.
   De Klerk has drastically reduced the army's power since he
replaced Botha in August. He has halved the period of compulsory
military service, cut the defense budget and ended military
management of black townships.

   Leona Helmsley is abdicating her three-year
reign in advertising as the picky-picky, tiara-wearing hotel queen.
   A new advertising campaign in April for the New York Helmsley
hotels will no longer feature Mrs. Helmsley, recently convicted of
federal tax fraud.
   The ad company that crowned her, Taylor-Gordon, Aarons &amp; Co.,
quit in August after she demanded that it slash its commissions by
60 percent. Last week, Smith-Greenland Inc. won the $3 million to
$5 million Helmsley account over 35 competing agencies.
   ``It was our point of view, and she agreed'' to stop using her
picture in future print and TV ads, said Leo Greenland, chairman of
Smith-Greenland.
   But though she'll no longer appear in the picture, ``she is
president of the corporation and her presence is there _
definitely,'' Greenland said.
   ``We are going to sell the impeccable service that the hotel
group delivers to each of its guests,'' he said. ``The emphasis
will be on the theme that comes out of her business philosophy:
fierce attention to details.''
   Greenland said the new ads will boast guest room features such
as magnifying mirrors and foil covers on complimentary bottles of
hand cream so guests can be confident that ``no one else could have
used the cream before.''

   A retired tanker captain suggested
today that Joseph Hazelwood could have removed the helmsman of the
Exxon Valdez if he doubted the man's capability in steering.
   Under prosecution questioning, Robert Beevers, of Grand Falls,
Wash., said a tanker captain rarely can remove a seaman from duty
without good cause, but can shift his assignments on board.
   ``Is there a difference between someone qualified to steer and
someone you would have confidence in in close waters?'' asked
Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole.
   ``Oh, yes,'' said Beevers, noting that anyone licensed by the
Coast Guard is considerd qualified to steer. But in a tricky area
such as Prince William Sound, he said, ``you would need someone who
throughout the trip had proved he was capable of steering. ... You
have to watch closely and decide who is a good helmsman and who is
not.''
   Some witnesses at Hazelwood's trial have blamed the grounding of
the Exxon Valdez last March 24 on a helmsman who failed to follow
commands to turn the ship away from the reef.
   Beevers was offered as an expert witness on the operations of
the large ships. He said that on any trip the union provides a
crew, but it is up to the skipper to monitor their abilities.
   Testimony has been inconclusive on whether Hazelwood knew that
the helmsman, Robert Kagan, had a history of problems with steering.
   Hazelwood, 43, a veteran seaman from Huntington, N.Y., is
charged with second-degree criminal mischief, a felony, and three
misdemeanors: reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil. If convicted on all
counts he could face a maximim of 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in
fines.
   The Exxon Valdez spewed nearly 11 million gallons of oil into
pristine Prince William Sound, killing countless birds, fish and
other wildlife and blackening hundreds of miles of shore.
   On Monday, another expert witness gave jurors a scenario of
death and destruction that might have followed the skipper's
efforts to free the Exxon Valdez from a jagged reef.
   No one died in the grounding of the 987-foot tanker, but George
Greiner Jr., a retired Coast Guard captain, testified that the
engine room could have been flooded, killing crew members below. He
said that Hazelwood risked their lives by trying to drive the ship
off Bligh Reef.
   Defense attorneys attacked Greiner's testimony as inaccurate and
elicited his concession that the ship was incapable of moving
anywhere after it struck the reef and unleashed the nation's worst
oil spill.
   Greiner, who spent 33 years in the Coast Guard, is a marine
safety consultant from Ridgefield, Wash. He said the state is
paying him more than $20,000 for his work on the Hazelwood case.
   He analyzed shipboard recorders of course changes as the vessel
entered Prince William Sound in the early morning hours of March 24
and said it was obvious that after the ship ran aground, Hazelwood
tried to extricate it by putting the engines on full maneuvering
speed.
   In records for the time between 12:38 a.m. and 1:41 a.m., he
said, the vessel's heading swung back and forth.
   ``The movement of the rudder back and forth is consistent with
trying to move the vessel off the rock or bottom. I can think of no
other reason for it,'' Greiner said under questioning from
Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole.
   Asked what risks were involved, Greiner said, ``The risk was
additional damage to the vessel and possible death or injury to
people in the engine room.'' He said the ship ``could be totally
lost if it came off'' the reef.
   The defense, which had contended that Hazelwood was trying to
stablize the ship, took a slightly different position Monday.
Attorney Michael Chalos suggested that even if Hazelwood was trying
to extricate the vessel it didn't matter because the engine was not
powerful enough move it the 450 feet required to get off the reef.
   ``Do you know how much thrust would have to be generated by the
engine to move this vessel one inch?'' asked Chalos.
   ``No,'' said Greiner. ``There's no way to calculate it.''
   Chalos then asked whether after the accident the ship was
capable of moving even one inch.
   ``Obviously, it wasn't,'' said Greiner. ``It didn't move.''
   Chalos suggested that Hazelwood's efforts to extricate the
tanker from the reef thus meant little in assessing the criminal
charges against him.
   Greiner said there was no damage evident from Hazelwood's
post-grounding actions but speculated there might be some damage
not visible immediately.
   ``Would that damage have resulted in any more of a spill?''
asked Chalos.
   ``In actuality, no,'' said Greiner.

<HEAD>Plunge in Big-Ticket Orders Raises Worry About U.S. Manufacturing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods
plunged 10.5 percent in January, the biggest drop in 32 years of
recordkeeping, the government said Tuesday in a report raising new
concerns about widespread weakness in American manufacturing.
   While most private analysts maintained the country will avoid a
recession, some were not so sure, expressing fears that further
weakness in manufacturing could lead to more job layoffs, sagging
consumer confidence and cutbacks in consumer spending, which
accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity.
   And with the fresh signs of slow growth in the first quarter,
analysts were looking for Wednesday's Commerce Department report on
the gross national product to show the extent of economic
stagnation in the last three months of 1989.
   In its first estimate of the fourth quarter GNP last month, the
department said economic activity slowed to a 0.5 percent growth
rate from 3 percent in the third. Some economists believe the
October-December growth will be revised downward based on
information that has become available since the initial estimate
was made.
   ``I wouldn't rule out a negative (growth), but I think it's
doubtful,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist with the Boston Co.
``But even if it is a small negative or a small positive, it would
be the same. The economy ground to a halt in the fourth quarter.''
   Many analysts had been looking for a slight improvement in the
first half of 1990, but some expressed reservations after Tuesday's
durable goods report.
   ``Overall, it was an indication the manufacturing economy
definitely is slowing down further,'' said economist Thomas
Runiewicz of the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   ``The sharp decline is another sign we'll see virtually no real
economic growth in the first quarter,'' concluded Jerry Jasinowski,
president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sought in congressional
testimony Tuesday to play down the number, although he admitted it
was ``lower than I would have expected.''
   Greenspan said it was the central bank's judgment ``that orders
basically are flat.''
   But Paul Getman, an economist with Regional Financial Associates
in West Chester, Pa., contended:
   ``This is more evidence that the slowdown in growth has not
passed and we may be just in the middle of it. The economy's growth
rate may slow even further in the months ahead.''
   Not all of Tuesday's economic reports were bad, however. The
Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit had
narrowed to $113.2 billion last year, the best showing since 1984
and an 11 percent improvement over 1988.
   The report on merchandise trade as calculated on a
balance-of-payments basis showed a 13.4 percent gain in exports, to
a record $361.9 billion. This offset a 6.4 percent increase in
imports, which also hit an all-time high at $475.1 billion.
   But in its other report, the department said orders for durable
goods _ items expected to last more than three years _ fell to
$118.2 billion after having risen 1.4 percent in December and 4.8
percent a month earlier.
   It was the steepest decline since the government began keeping
records of orders in 1958 and broke the previous record drop of 9.2
percent, set in February 1982, during the last recession.
   ``Most of the decline was in transportation,'' the Commerce
Department said, with aircraft accounting for about half of the
decrease in that sector. Analysts had noted an unusually large
number of aircraft orders in the previous two months and said the
January drop represented a return to normal.
   But motor vehicle orders also were down sharply as automakers
laid off tens of thousands of workers in January to pare bloated
inventories. The auto industry has been among the weakest in the
manufacturing sector recently.
   Overall, transportation orders were down 27.6 percent, to $27.9
billion, after having gained 4.8 percent in December and 10.8
percent in November. Excluding transportation, orders would have
been off 3.4 percent.
   Electrical machinery orders were off sharply, down 17.6 percent
to $18.8 billion, after having risen 5.6 percent in Decmeber and
7.3 percent a month earlier.
   Defense capital goods orders were down 36 percent, to $6.3
billion, due to government cutbacks in military spending. Excluding
defense, orders were down 8.4 percent.
   The closely watched non-defense capital goods sector, often a
barometer of business investment plans, also fell, down 13.7
percent and reversing December's 14.2 percent gain.
   Non-electrical machinery and primary metals orders both rose
slightly. Non-electrical machinery orders were up 2.6 percent, to
$22.3 billion, while primary metals increased 1.5 percent, to $11.1
billion.

   The White House today denied a report that the
United States and Iran held secret talks in Geneva aimed at
securing the release of Americans held hostage in Lebanon.
   ``We are not aware of the source of these stories or any talks
that fit this description,'' said White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater.
   The report was carried by a London-based Lebanese newspaper,
Al-Hayat. An editor at the paper said the Arabic-language story
reported that Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, a key Lebanese
Shiite Moslem cleric, had said contacts took place between Iran and
the United States, through third parties.
   Fadlallah, said to have spoken in Beirut after a trip to the
Iranian capital, Tehran, is spiritual leader of the Iran-aligned
Hezbollah group. Some Western hostages are believed held by
factions linked to Hezbollah.
   Fitzwater said the administration continues to pursue leads and
contacts that might glean information about potential release of
the hostages, but he would not reveal what they were.
   Fitzwater talked around the question of whether President Bush
had authorized any officials to conduct talks on the hostages,
except to say there were no talks between the U.S. emissaries and
Iran.
   ``There are no direct talks between the United States and Iran
authorized by the president,'' he said.
   ``I don't know who's talking to who,'' the spokesman said.``But
I guarantee you I'm never going to say that nobody's talking,
because I know a lot of people are.''
   ``There are a lot of people around the world talking about
release of the hostages in Lebanon _ people from other countries,
people from other embassies, people on all levels, people we don't
even find out about until after the fact,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``I will never rule out meetings anywhere, anyplace, anytime by
anybody on the hostage question. Because there are meetings
happening. But high-level U.S. officials, direct secret talks, no.
Do I expect a breakthrough or anything new happening? No.''
   Fitzwater said the administration knows ``of no new evidence''
to support hopes that the hostages' release might be forthcoming.''
   Last month, a Kuwaiti newspaper, Al-Qabas, said ``an American
personality'' had met in Geneva with a representative of Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani to discuss the hostage issue. None of
those supposedly involved was identified.
   Eight Americans are held hostage in Lebanon, including Terry
Anderson, the Associated Press chief Middle East correspondent
whose captivity is nearing the five-year mark, the longest period
of any of those held.
   The others, kidnapped by Moslem extremists, are: Thomas
Sutherland, Frank Herbert Reed, Joseph James Cicippio, Edward
Austin Tracy, Jesse Turner, Alann Steen and Robert Polhill.

   Crowds watched the last of Rio's
lavish Carnival parades Tuesday and revelers prepared to bring four
days of riotous pre-Lenten festivities to a close at all-night
balls.
   Brazilians return to the realities of 70 percent monthly
inflation at midday Wednesday, when banks, stores, and government
offices open for the first time since Friday.
   In Rio, the undisputed capital of Brazil's Carnival, the last of
the glittering ``Samba School'' parades danced along the six-block
``Sambadrome'' early Tuesday. The stands were filled to capacity
with 75,000 people who danced, sang and cheered as the parades
passed.
   The parades, which slum neighborhood groups spend a whole year
and millions of dollars preparing, are the highlight of Rio's
festivities. The 16 top ``schools'' parade in two 15-hour marathon
sessions, which begin Sunday and Monday nights and end the
following days.
   Each ``school'' picks a theme for its parade. It then composes a
samba, choreographs dance steps and designs costumes and floats
around the idea. In the parades, about 5,000 costumed dancers and
percussionists march beside massive multicolored floats.
   On Tuesday, the clear crowd favorite was Mocidade Independente,
backed by more than 500 percussionists. When the school finished
its performance, the crowd roared ``They've already won.''
   Another contender for the championship, Mangueira, had perhaps
the most beautiful costumes, with samba dancers clad in plush
pink-and-green feather headresses.
   As in most years, many female samba dancers wore little more
than skimpy, sequined bikini bottoms.
   The naming of the parade winner is scheduled for Wednesday.
   After the parade, celebrants rested for a few hours, but by
early afternoon thousands were on the streets again dancing to
samba bands mounted on trucks, which snaked through city
neighborhoods.
   Several all-night balls late Tuesday were to bring Carnival
celebrations to a close.
   The two biggest, expected to attract up to 10,000 revelers each,
are the Grande Gala G for homosexuals and Monte Libano nightclub's
particularly raunchy bash, part of which is broadcast live on a
local TV network.
   Carnival celebrations also were held elsewhere in this nation of
150 million, particularly in northeastern coastal cities.

   A hired killer gunned down a murder trial
witness to eliminate the man's testimony against four suspects
charged with the drug-related slaying of the witness' girlfriend,
authorities said Tuesday.
   John Shelton, 43, was killed Feb. 7 outside a dry cleaners in
the Queens borough by a ski-masked man with an M-1 rifle,
authorities said. Shelton had been at home with his longtime
girlfriend, Maxine Peterson, when she died in a hail of 20 bullets
on May 28, 1988.
   Ms. Peterson was standing in her kitchen holding her 6-week-old
baby when she was shot; the baby was not harmed.
   Ms. Peterson's killers, believed to be drug dealers, allegedly
were retaliating for a shooting committed by her son earlier that
day.
   A spokesman for the Queens district attorney said it was not
definite that Shelton would have testified against four young men
charged with Ms. Peterson's killing. But police Lt. Eugene Dunbar
said: ``The information we have is he was killed because he was
going to testify.''
   Opening statements began Monday in the trial of the four murder
defendants, with no mention of Shelton's slaying.
   Reports in the Daily News and New York Newsday said Shelton's
killer received between $3,000 and $10,000. An 18-year-old has been
charged.
   The Shelton shooting was not the first violent incident
involving witnesses in cases in Queens. In October 1987, taxi
dispatcher Mildred Green was shot to death at her job after she
appeared before a grand jury investigating a shootout outside her
office.
   A month later, a drug-case witness who uses the single name
Arjune was targeted by drug dealers who firebombed his home. Police
assigned a round-the-clock guard to Arjune's home; one of his
protectors, Officer Edward Byrne, was killed Feb. 22, 1988, on the
order of local drug dealers.
   ``Certainly, it raises concerns among witnesses. It does have a
chilling effect. People think twice about coming forward,'' said
Dick Piperno, spokesman for District Attorney John J. Santucci.
   ``But they still do. People have the guts to come forward.''
   Authorities say Michael Bethea, 18, already jailed on drug and
weapon charges, has been charged with murdering Shelton. He is
scheduled for arraignment March 15.
   Piperno, citing the ongoing trial, would not provide any details
about why Shelton was targeted or who might have hired his killer.
   Bethea's lawyer, Michael A. Fishman, offered no comment on the
charges.
   Opening statements in the Peterson murder trial began Monday in
state court.
   The defendants charged with killing Ms. Peterson are Gary
Steadman, 24; Raymond Blair, 21; Kevin Gaines, 27; and Keenan Wynn,
21, all from Queens.

   A 12-year-old boy who got lost in the snowy woods
was rescued nine hours later along with his Labrador retriever, who
helped keep him alive by huddling against him and licking his face.
   The dog, Shadow, was lying across the lap of Greg Holzworth when
rescuers reached them early Monday.
   Searchers found them by following the sound of the dog's barking.
   ``It was sort of like scary,'' the sixth-grader said in a
telephone interview from school Tuesday.
   ``Everything looked the same. It was like we were walking around
in circles. My pants got frozen because I had to walk through these
puddles.''
   Greg's adventure began a little before 4 p.m. Sunday when he and
Shadow set off for a walk in the thick, swampy woods that line his
family's home in Raynham, 30 miles south of Boston.
   Greg said he intended to take a short walk with Shadow, who
joined the family nine years ago when he was a puppy. Greg was
wearing a denim jacket missing buttons over a T-shirt and cotton
pants, and gloves.
   But the two ventured farther in the woods than planned. Greg
started building a fort of brush and tree limbs; heard Shadow
barking; and followed the dog even farther into the woods.
   Greg realized he was in trouble when falling snow began covering
his tracks. It had snowed most of the day, the end of a storm that
dumped about 8 inches on the region. The temperature dropped to 10
degrees.
   ``Shadow lay down next to me and he kept his head on my legs and
he'd lick me in the face,'' Greg said. ``He kept me warm.''
   Raynham police Officer Thomas Smith said the dog's body heat
helped keep the boy alive.
   Greg's father, Donald, started searching for his son around 6
p.m. When he hadn't returned an hour later, his wife, Donna, called
police. Greg is the younger of their two sons.
   More than 100 people, including police and firefighters using
megaphones and sirens, combed the woods.
   ``I can't tell you how thrilled I was to have so many people
help us,'' Mrs. Holzworth said Tuesday.
   Greg's memories are a little hazy. For one, he thought it was
only about dinnertime _ not 1 a.m. _ when he was actually found.
   ``I was laying down because I was cold and I could barely walk
because my pants wouldn't bend,'' he recalled. ``After a while my
legs started hurting and they got wicked sore. I could hear people
yelling. I couldn't really yell back because my throat was sore and
I had chapped lips.''
   They were found just a half mile from home.
   Greg was treated at a hospital for exposure.
   Shadow was rewarded with a full day inside the house Monday,
Mrs. Holzworth said. Normally he stays in the basement or outside.
   ``And my dad gave him a steak, too,'' Greg said.

   Here is a roundup of editorials on Violeta Chamorro's election
victory over Marxist Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua:
   ``Most of all (Mrs. Chamorro) has to rely on the understanding
and generosity of a government in Washington that has all but sent
Nicaragua to its deathbed to scourge it of Marxism. In the process
30,000 Nicaraguans have lost their lives and untold others have
been maimed, fallen prey to disease or suffered privation. They
have paid fearfully for U.S. insistence on ideological orthodoxy
and now President Bush must move beyond the mere retraction of our
sanctions and international-loan blackball to a trade and aid
program that welcomes Nicaragua wholeheartedly back into the
hemispheric fold.'' The Atlanta Constitution.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``In fairness, though, the defeated President Daniel Ortega and
his Sandinista associates must be accorded a full measure of
recognition for having held what was universally conceded to be a
fair election, and for having committed themselves to abide by the
results... Ortega's reaction to the voters' verdict reflected
political and personal maturity. It may also have indicated a
recognition that there just isn't much of a market these days for
Marxist regimentation and inefficiency.'' Corpus Christi
Caller-Times.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Victory is always sweet, but it is not necessarily permanent.
Violeta Chamorro, upset winner of Nicaragua's presidential contest,
need only consider the troubles of Corazon Aquino in the
Philippines to see what can happen following a triumph on election
day. In Central America in particular, civilian presidents do not
always control the military and, as a result, ruthless officers
sometimes hold the real power. If Nicaragua is to recover from 10
years of the civil war that cost an estimated 30,000 lives, it is
essential that Chamorro win not just a title but the authority that
belongs to the head of government.'' San Francisco Chronicle.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The United States, as principal bankroller of the
anti-Sandinista forces, is deeply obligated to rebuild the
devastated, poverty-stricken country. As starters, the U.S. trade
embargo should be lifted, international loans should be arranged
and economic assistance should be extended on a generous scale. For
President Bush and Congress, this will require more changes in a
foreign aid program already strained by the budget crunch and the
needs of Panama and Eastern Europe.'' The Sun in Baltimore.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``All it took was one free election for the Nicaraguan people to
reject 10 years of Sandinista rule and take back their revolution.
Now comes the hard part: governing a nation whose economy has been
all but ruined by inflation, bad management, war and a U.S. trade
embargo .... If the transition goes peacefully ... there is one
important certainty: When given a voice, the Nicaraguans decided
their fate, not with a bullet but with a ballot. It's a shame they
didn't get that chance years earlier.'' Beacon Journal in Akron,
Ohio.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``As for what U.S. policy now will be, it appears, ironically,
that things might have been easier for policy-makers if the
Sandinistas had won; the administration then may have taken the
option of quietly disengaging itself and walking away. Now,
however, President Bush will have to demonstrate his commitment to
the Chamorro government, which will be faced with enormous
challenges upon taking power. The Nicaraguan heroine of the moment,
Violeta Chamorro, may have more in common with Philippines
President Corazon Aquino than she would have preferred.'' The
Dallas Morning News.

<TEXT>
   ``Election of opposition candidate Violeta Chamarro as
Nicaragua's president offers hope for democracy at last in one of
the last holdouts against the tide of freedom sweeping the world.
...Although it happened on President Bush's watch, her election is
a vindication of the challenge to the Sandinista regime put forth
by former President Reagan.'' The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The U.S. also now has a solemn obligation to end its economic
boycott of Nicaragua _ which has had devastating effects on the
small country _ and to replace it with significant economic
assistance. Nicaragua's desperate economic plight probably had more
to do with the election result than any other single factor.''
Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

<TEXT>
   ``Nothing less than the beginning of a political miracle appears
to have occurred in Nicaragua. A Marxist government that came to
power by revolution has not only permitted a fair election, it has
lost the election resoundingly. (But) ...unless UNO has control of
the army and Interior Ministry, the election's results, so
heartening today, eventually will turn to ashes.'' The Miami Herald.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The citizens of Nicaragua finally got a chance for an honest
vote, and they did what abused and oppressed people generally do
when they get the opportunity _ they threw the rascals out.
....Ortega, who has been trying in recent weeks to set the stage
for improved relations with the United States, must be given credit
for allowing a fair and free election. That the Sandinistas should
allow such a remarkable event is vindication of the much-criticized
U.S. policy of pressuring Ortega's government to allow dissent and
democracy.'' Nashville Banner.

<HEAD>Legislators Approve Powerful Presidency Under Gorbachev Pressure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A determined and at times angry Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Tuesday rammed through the Soviet legislature his
proposal for a more powerful presidency that progressive lawmakers
warned could become a dictatorship.
   Gorbachev, his voice rising as his temper frayed, accused his
critics of engaging in ``cheap demagoguery.'' The Soviet leader
recognized lawmakers and revoked their right to speak apparently at
whim during the often-stormy debate.
   He hailed the Supreme Soviet's final and overwhelming approval
of his proposal as a ``a great political event.'' But lawmaker
Leonid Sukhov, a Ukrainian taxi driver, warned: ``The way the
voting went today is the same way presidential power will be.''
   After only two days of discussion, spread over two weeks, the
Supreme Soviet voted 347-24 with 43 abstentions to approve creation
in principle of a national presidency with a five-year term, to
replace the government post now held by Gorbachev, whose formal
title is Supreme Soviet chairman.
   The bill was remanded to committees to consider the dozens of
amendments offered by deputies during debate.
   Subject to final approval by the legislature's parent body, the
Congress of People's Deputies, the president will be granted powers
to veto laws, unilaterally declare states of emergency, and name
the prime minister, according to a copy of the bill shown to
Western reporters.
   Gorbachev, who chaired the legislature's proceedings, emphasized
he has not yet been elected president and said he has even
considered refusing the office, but few expect the 58-year-old
Communist Party chief not to be chosen.
   The presidency would give Gorbachev a new and stable power base
at a time when his 20 million-member party's popularity and
prestige are waning and it pursues the declared aim of following
East Europe's Communist parties in renouncing its legally
guaranteed right to govern and compete in a multiparty system.
   Progressive lawmakers strongly objected to concentrating so much
power in one leader's hands and what they called Gorbachev's undue
haste in pressing the issue on the Supreme Soviet. But other
legislators said mounting economic, social and ethnic woes prove
the need for a strong leader.
   ``We are tired of social tension. When are you going to put the
country in order?'' lawmaker Rano A. Ubaidullaeva of Uzbekistan
said her constituents were demanding. ``We need a person who can
have real power ... the quicker the better.''
   But Anatoly A. Sobchak rejected the demand for ``a strong hand''
voiced by some. ``We are deciding the question of appointing a
nationwide gendarme,'' the Leningrad jurist said. He told the
542-member legislature: ``All our decisions can be crossed out by
the president.''
   Sobchak and another member of the progressive Inter-Regional
Group of parliamentarians, Sergei Stankevich of Moscow, said the
new presidency would tilt the balance of power toward the head of
state to the detriment of the new working legislature, which has
functioned for less than a year.
   ``We know all too well from the history of our country how
dangerous is the concentration and super-concentration of power and
authority in one place,'' said Stankevich, who has studied the U.S.
Constitution.
   Visibly stung by some lawmakers' insinuations that the new
office was being tailor-made for him, Gorbachev exclaimed from the
dais: ``This is not serious. This is cheap demagoguery!''
   ``We're talking about the president's power, about
constitutional changes,'' he said. ``What does Gorbachev have to do
with this?''
   He repeated previous assurances that there would be more than
one candidate for the office, and added: ``Sometimes I have an
outrageous thought, in order to prove that this (the political
system) is not being adjusted for somebody ... to decline if my
name is on the list of candidates.''
   But he said such an act would be ``cowardice.'' The new
presidency, he said, was vital for the success of his economic and
social reform drive, known as ``perestroika.''
   According to the draft bill on the presidency shown to
reporters, the holder of the office must be a Soviet citizen at
least 35 years old. The president will be directly elected by the
voters, the bill stipulates, but the jurist who presented it to the
Supreme Soviet said the procedure will be different the first time.
   Vladimir Kudryavtsev, a vice president of the Academy of
Sciences, said the first president will be elected by the Congress
to a four-year term, because it would take too long to prepare a
nationwide election. The president's term would thus expire along
with those of the 2,250 members of the Congress, who were elected
last year.
   The bill shown to reporters empowers the president:
   _ To unilaterally declare a state of emergency anywhere in the
country, and to declare war if the Soviet Union is invaded.
   _ To appoint the prime minister, subject to confirmation by the
Supreme Soviet.
   _ To be commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
   _ To veto legislation. If the Supreme Soviet overrides the veto
by a majority vote, the president can appeal to the Congress or go
over the heads of the lawmakers by scheduling a nationwide
referendum.
   On Gorbachev's recommendation, the Supreme Soviet voted to
convene an extraordinary session of the Congress on March 12 to
approve the constitutional changes creating the new office and
elect the president.
   After the Supreme Soviet adjourned for the day, Inter-Regional
Group members caucused in a Kremlin sideroom dominated by a
painting of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin haranguing a crowd on Red
Square.
   ``It's awful,'' historian Yuri N. Afanasyev said of the
legislature's proceedings. ``It shows there are around 300 people
in the Supreme Soviet who simply do what Gorbachev wants.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush and Irish Prime Minister
Charles J. Haughey agreed Tuesday to expand U.S.-European Community
ties, including formal semi-annual meetings between Bush and the
president of the 12-nation council.
   Bush, hailing the peaceful revolutions that have changed the
face of Eastern Europe, said, ``Transatlantic cooperation now is
more important than ever.''
   Haughey, the current president of the European Council, said the
regular presidential meetings will provide ``a new framework for
enhanced political and economic ties between the community and the
United States. The U.S. secretary of state will also meet twice a
year with his European counterparts.
   ``We are in fact building a broader bridge across the
Atlantic,'' said Haughey, standing beside Bush outside the White
House at a frigid departure ceremony following talks in the Oval
Office and a private luncheon.
   Bush praised the Irish Republic's efforts to bring peace to
Northern Ireland, torn by sectarian strife now entering its third
decade.
   ``In a time when all things seem possible, all Americans hope
for an end to the conflict that has brought such sadness to your
beautiful land and your wonderful people,'' said Bush.
   Visibly touched, Haughey departed from his text to say, ``I
greatly appreciate the president's deep personal concern for the
situation in Northern Ireland and his constant wish to be of any
possible assistance he can in bringing forward a solution to that
intractable and difficult and tragic problem.''
   Haughey, president of the European Council for the first half of
1990, has called a special summit of the 12 nations in Dublin April
28 to discuss German unification and the dramatic shifts toward
democracy in once hard-line communist states.
   The Irish leader, serving as Eire's prime minister atop a
coalition government for the fourth time in the past decade, called
it a ``very exciting time for all humanity.''
   ``The president and I agreed that the United States and the
Community have a pivotal role to play in overcoming the divisions
between East and West and in laying the foundations for a Europe
united in its commitment to peace, prosperity, democracy and, above
all, a respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms,'' said
Haughey.
   Bush said, ``We both welcome the prospect of overcoming the
artificial division of the continent.''
   ``There is no question that Western solidarity protects
stability in this time of change. ... The United States will remain
a European power,'' Bush promised.
   He said they both also ``look to the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe to play a greater role in Europe's future.''
   ``We believe the EC must play a vital role in the new Europe. A
more united Europe, able to take its rightful place in world
affairs, is good for the United States of America,'' said Bush.
``We'll look for ways to improve our ties to the community so a new
Atlanticism will be teamed with a new Europe.''
   The two leaders pledged to cooperate in the fight against drug
trafficking, on global warming and other environmental issues.
   They also discussed bilateral issues including immigration,
trade and foreign investment.

   Widespread snow and rain over large areas of
the Great Plains have brightened the outlook for wheat farmers, the
government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday.
   ``Moisture improved winter wheat growth in the central and
southern Great Plains,'' the facility said in its report for Feb.
19-25. ``The northern Great Plains remained dry.''
   The facility is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments. Weekly reports cover weather and crop conditions but
do not include production forecasts.
   Looking at other crops, the report said rain again slowed field
work in the Delta and the Southeast. Corn planting began in
southwest Georgia and continued in Florida and Texas.
   Rain fell in all of Florida's citrus areas, and new growth was
reported ``abundant and trees were blooming in all areas.''
   ``Cold temperatures may have damaged peaches in northern Georgia
and portions of Tennessee,'' the report said. ``Peaches were
blooming in Texas (and) cold temperatures may have damaged peaches
in the Cross Timbers area.''
   In California, early varieties of apricots, plums, nectarines
and peaches were blooming, but frost damage was reported to early
peaches and table grapes in Riverside County.

<HEAD>At Least 48 Killed on Election Day for 8 State Legislatures</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At least 47 people were killed and 200
wounded by bombs, factional battles or police during voting Tuesday
for legislatures in eight Indian states, news agencies reported.
   Press Trust of India said 45 people were killed in Bihar, an
eastern state that is among India's poorest, and two in the western
state of Gujarat.
   It said an election officer died of a heart attack in
mountainous Himachal Pradesh state.
   Bihar is notorious for organized gangs that operate during
elections. One of the victims there was an independent candidate
shot and killed by unidentified gunmen.
   Three of the 45 victims in Bihar were killed by police who
opened fire near Patna, the state capital, to stop stuffing of
ballot boxes, United News of India reported. It said the others
were killed by bombs or in fights between members of rival
political parties.
   About 150 million voters cast ballots for 1,610 members of the
eight legislatures, all of which have been controlled by the
Congress Party of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   The elections were seen as a test of the Congress Party's waning
popularity and the rising voter appeal of the right-wing Bharatia
Janata, or Indian People's Party.
   More than 45,000 members of federal security forces were
deployed for the elections, 18,000 of them in Bihar. Thirteen
people were killed during election campaigning in the eight states,
including 11 in Bihar.
   About 70 percent of the 213 million registered voters turned out
in Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa and Rajasthan states. Results are not
expected until Wednesday.
   Elections also were held in Pondicherry, a federally
administered territory in the south, and in five national
parliamentary constituencies and 17 state legislative districts
where by-elections were due or elections had been canceled because
candidates died.
   In November's national elections, Indians voted the Congress
Party out of power, replacing it with the National Front coalition
of Prime Minister V.P. Singh.
   The alliance of Singh's Janata Dal, or People's Party, and three
minor factions is supported by the the Bharatia Janata and
Communists.
   Gandhi's Congress Party entered candidates for all but 30 of the
state legislative seats. The Janata Dal and Bharatia Janata were in
about 1,000 contests each.
   More than half the 21,200 candidates were independents.
   The Hindustan Times of New Delhi said the elections were being
conducted under ``what is regarded as the tightest-ever security
arrangements, in view of the increasing incidence of poll violence
and booth capturing.''
   ``Booth capturing'' covers a variety of activity from stuffing
of ballot boxes to intimidation that sometimes ends in murder.

   Police interviewed witnesses Tuesday to track
down the man who shot to death Cornelius Gunter, lead vocalist for
The Coasters. The '50s group's hits included ``Charlie Brown'' and
``Love Potion No.9.''
   Gunter, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987,
was the second member of the '50s group to die in a shooting in the
Las Vegas area.
   Witnesses told police that Gunter's car was parked at an
intersection in a residential area of the adjoining city of North
Las Vegas on Monday and a thin black man was standing on the
driver's side, talking to Gunter.
   ``They apparently got into a loud argument,'' said North Las
Vegas Police Lt. Gary Rainey. ``People heard a couple of shots.
Then the car took off, went about a block, then hit a block wall.''
   Gunter, who was scheduled to perform this weekend, was found
slumped over the steering wheel, with two gunshot wounds in his
chest.
   ``It appears he was shot through the windshield and he was dead
on the scene. We don't have a motive at this time,'' said Rainey.
   The suspect was seen running from the intersection with a gun in
his hand, Rainey said.
   Rainey said Gunter, a Las Vegas resident, had no police record
other than some traffic citations in North Las Vegas.
   Gunter, a tenor, joined The Coasters in 1957, two years after
the group was formed in Los Angeles. Their comic vocals resulted in
a string of wise-cracking do-wop hits in the late 1950s.
   With a flurry of hits that included ``Yakety Yak'' in 1957 and
``Charlie Brown,'' ``Along Came Jones'' and ``Poison Ivy'' in 1959,
The Coasters were the country's most popular black rock 'n' roll
group at the end of the decade.
   Among their other hits were ``Framed,'' ``Idol with the Golden
Head,'' and ``Shoppin' for Clothes.''
   Their last chart appearance was in 1971 with ``Love Potion No.
9.''
   With varying personnel, Gunter kept the group on the concert
circuit in the 1980s, including the current ensemble known as
Cornell Gunter and His Coasters. Various band members headed
separate groups billed as The Coasters in recent years.
   Gunter and The Coasters were scheduled to perform at the Lady
Luck Hotel this weekend, said Janice Mazuroski, a hotel spokeswoman.
   ``It's a sad situation. He was so well liked in the industry,''
she said.
   The other Coaster slain, Nathaniel ``Buster'' Wilson was shot in
the head in April 1980. His dismembered body was dumped near Hoover
Dam and in a canyon near Modesto, Calif.
   Patrick Cavanaugh was convicted in the slaying and is now on
Nevada's death row. Prosecutors speculated that Wilson was shot
because he was going to tell police about a fraud scheme in which
Cavanaugh was allegedly involved.

<HEAD>John Lawn Retiring as DEA Chief</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John C. Lawn will retire as head of the Drug
Enforcement Administration next month after five tumultuous years
when drugs and related violence commanded the attention of the
American people.
   Lawn, whose retirement was announced Tuesday, took over the
agency in 1985 just as Mexican authorities were discovering the
bodies of slain DEA agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena and his Mexican
pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   Lawn's role in pressuring Mexican officials to pursue those
behind the kidnap-torture-slaying of the two was portrayed last
month in a television miniseries called, ``Drug Wars: The Camarena
Story.''
   In an interview in December, Lawn gave no hint that he might be
retiring this year as head of the lead federal agency for drug law
enforcement.
   When asked how long he would like to keep his job, Lawn said,
``Until I become tired of it.''
   He acknowledged that the job was ``frustrating and
challenging,'' and added, ``Some point in time will come that I'll
have to turn over the reins, but I don't know when that'll be.''
   One reason behind the decision to retire after 27 years of
government service is that he will turn 55 in a few months, said
DEA spokesman Frank Shults.
   While Lawn, as a presidential appointee, is exempt from the
mandatory retirement age of 55 imposed on other federal law
enforcement officers, ``he would not be able to maintain his
position as a law enforcement officer, just an administrator,''
Shults said. ``It's extremely important to him ... that he is a
special agent. That's his motivation.
   ``There's no suggestion that he's giving up the war on drugs,''
Shults said. ``He's very torn. ... It was an extremely difficult
decision for him to make.''
   In a letter to President Bush announcing his intention to retire
March 23, Lawn said, ``My service as administrator of DEA over the
past five years has been most rewarding and most satisfying. The
ratification of the United Nations Convention, the National Drug
Control Strategy and the Cartagena Summit have established the
foundations upon which we can project with confidence our ultimate
success in this battle.''
   Lawn also thanked Bush for ``your personal involvement in
honoring those DEA special agents who have paid the ultimate price
in this battle,'' saying that action, combined with support for the
agents' families ``have special significance for the men and women
of the Drug Enforcement Administration and for me.''
   In the December interview, Lawn said the toughest part of his
job was the loss of personnel such as Camarena. He also expressed
disappointment with the size of the drug war budget, contrasting
the $9.5 billion budget for 1990 to the ``excess of $30 billion a
year'' the United States spent for the Vietnam War.
   ``To have fewer agents than there are musicians in the United
States Army, or to have fewer agents than there are New York City
Transit Police ... you get a sense of too few people being asked to
face a Herculean challenge,'' Lawn said.
   Just as Lawn is leaving, the Bush administration has requested a
budget of $10.6 billion for the war on drugs in 1991, a sum that
would boost DEA's share from $616.9 million this year to $791.3
million next year, enough to add several hundred new agents to the
current complement of 3,191. When Lawn took over the job in 1985,
the DEA budget was $353.8 million.
   Lawn, who was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., plans to return to New
York City for a job in the private sector, said Shults, who did not
give details of Lawn's new job.
   ``Jack Lawn has provided extraordinary leadership to the Drug
Enforcement Administration during an extremely challenging time,''
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement. ``He has been
a catalyst for leadership in the international law enforcement
community, helping to unite the drug-fighting efforts of many
countries. ... His contributions to the international war on drugs
will be missed.''
   Lawn, a former Marine Corps officer, joined the FBI in 1967 and
served in Savannah, Ga.; Monterey, Calif.; Kansas City, Mo.; San
Antonio, Texas, and at FBI headquarters before he became acting
deputy administrator of DEA in 1982.
   President Reagan nominated Lawn to the top DEA job in 1985 to
replace Francis M. Mullen, who had retired.

<HEAD>Legislation on Right of Republics to Secede Introduced in
Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A draft law setting out a daunting procedure for a
republic to secede from the Soviet Union has been submitted to the
national legislature, a news service of Radio Moscow reported on
Tuesday.
   Calls for secession from the Soviet Union are strongest in the
Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which were
absorbed by the Soviet Union during World War II.
   The Soviet Communist Party recently pledged to support
legislation establishing a procedure by which republics could
legally secede from the union.
   But the law appeared certain to displease independent political
leaders in the Baltics who argue that Soviet political control of
their nations is not legitimate.
   According to the report published by Interfax, a recently
introduced news service of Radio Moscow, the question of secession
can be decided only after a referendum in the republic that wishes
to secede.
   The parliament of the republic or at least one-third of the
adult population of the republic can call for a referendum in which
three-fourths of the adult must vote for the results to be valid,
the report said.
   According to the draft, the results of the referendum will then
be submitted to the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of People's
Deputies, the two-tiered legislative system that will make a
preliminary decision on the basis of domestic and foreign
consequences of secession.
   Any secession would take place over a minimum of five years
until the final decision on separation is taken. That power rests
in the hands of the 2,250-member Congress. Two-thirds of the
deputies must approve the secession.
   During the transition phase, defense and security issues as well
as the establishment of a new border would be settled after which
the governments of the republic that has decided to secede and
other Soviet republics would settle financial and property issues.
   The seceding republic has the right to lease or buy any property
belonging to the Soviet Union as a whole or the property can be
returned.
   A spokeswoman for Sajudis, the Lithuanian Popular Front, said
the movement's leaders were meeting Tuesday night and could not be
reached for comment.
   Sajudis claimed a landslide victory in elections to the
Lithuanian parliament held Saturday and is determined to press
forward with its primary demand for the republic's independence and
sovereignty.
   Secessionist sentiment is strongest in Lithuania where native
Lithuanians make up 80 percent of the population, while in
neighboring Latvia, for example, the policy of Russification has
reduced the native population to about 50 percent.
   Even some Russians living in Latvia say secession and an
independent Latvia would be desirable because of the expected
economic benefits. Labor productivity and quality of goods is
higher in the Baltics than in other republics.

<TEXT>
   A major low-income housing landlord suspended
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development told Congress on
Tuesday that HUD footdragging and negligence greatly contributed to
poor conditions at properties cited in the sanctions.
   ``HUD's administration and oversight of inner-city problem
housing has been abysmal and verges on the criminal,'' A. Bruce
Rozet told a House Banking subcommittee, which in turn told Rozet
it planned to call HUD officials and tenants to discuss conditions
and management of the properties.
   Rozet, whose California-based companies control to varying
degrees some 45,000 subsidized housing units in 40 states and
Puerto Rico, accused HUD of reneging on several promises to help
his company revitalize troubled properties it acquired three years
ago.
   While most of his allegations dealt with HUD actions taken
during the Reagan administration, Rozet said current HUD Secretary
Jack Kemp, who suspended the Rozet companies last month, has added
only rhetoric to the nation's housing woes.
   ``They have condemned tenants to live in squalor while pleading
the poverty of the government and trying to shift the blame,''
Rozet said. ``They have raised the hopes of poor, inner-city
residents with rhetoric and promises of action and then dashed
their hopes on the anvil of purported reform and miserly budgets.''
   HUD General Counsel Francis Keating termed Rozet's accusations
``silly, irrational and untrue.'' He said the Rozet-led investors
had realized ``handsome returns'' and should put more of their
money into the projects before seeking additional government funds.
   ``His view was always, `Write me another check,''' Keating said.
``It should be the responsibility of the owner to keep up the
property, not the responsibility of the taxpayer.''
   The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, told
Rozet he would be called to testify again, after the panel hears
from HUD officials about properties managed by Rozet's Associated
Financial Corp. and its web of 40 affiliates.
   While placing no blame on Rozet, Gonzalez said he disagreed with
government policies that allow private investors such as Rozet's
groups to reap lucrative tax benefits from comparatively small
investments in low-income housing.
   Kemp has attacked Rozet's and other groups, saying they often
allow properties to decay and refuse to put money back into them.
Rozet in turn has argued that his groups have a strong record of
re-investing but often have been turned away by HUD when they
propose renovation plans.
   Gonzalez said he wanted to hear from HUD officials to determine
to what extent the agency's ``hands were dirtied.'' He told Rozet:
``I'm not too sure about yours.''
   Rozet has said the suspension, which prohibits his companies
from new HUD-related work, has forced him to seek to transfer most
of the 350 properties in his portfolio. He has vowed to fight HUD
in court and for the last month has been engaged in essentially a
battle of accusations with the agency.
   Kemp had four aides at Tuesday's hearing. Several times, one
scribbled down questions and had them delivered to Republican
subcommittee members.
   Rozet said he would gladly testify again and predicted the
subcommittee's review would support his contention that the poor
conditions at the properties cited in the suspension were
aggravated by HUD denials or delays when acting on renovation
proposals.
   ``The one thing HUD cannot do _ and Congress cannot let them do
_ is to make no decision and turn their back on the problem,''
Rozet said.
   The suspension alleges an AFC management affiliate misused
government and tenants' money at developments in Oklahoma and the
District of Columbia. Rozet submitted reams of documents to the
panel that he said proved his companies had done nothing wrong and
said they would prove that if HUD would grant them a hearing.
   At one point in his attempt to turn the tables on HUD, Rozet, a
Democratic Party fund-raiser, said perhaps none of his properties
would be troubled had he hired a Republican consultant to lobby HUD
for the proposals that were rejected.
   That was a reference to influence-peddling at HUD during the
Reagan years, the subject of extensive congressional hearings last
year and a Senate hearing even as Rozet spoke to the House
subcommittee.

<HEAD>Democratic Governors Criticize Bush on Eduation Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats accused President Bush on Tuesday of
being unwilling to provide the resources to upgrade the nation's
schools in line with the ambitious goals outlined by the president
and endorsed by the nation's governors.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told the closing session
of the annual midwinter meeting of the National Governors'
Association that Bush had proposed ``a meager 2 percent increase in
the federal spending on education.''
   Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus of Idaho characterized as
``malarky'' the president's pledge of support during a White House
meeting with the governors on Monday.
   Andrus said that when Bush was asked what support he could
provide he said, ``we will come out and stand behind you and beside
you as you tell your people they must increase the local property
taxes.''
   ``If he provides the rhetoric and we have to provide the
resources ... there's no way that we can meet the goals that he's
outlining,'' Andrus said.
   Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, a Republican who is chairman of the
NGA, said the federal government has a ``relatively limited role''
in providing financial support for education.
   He said the government provides only about 7 percent of the
money for public schools and that its principal responsibility was
to help disadvantaged children with such programs as Head Start.
   ``Money isn't the total answer,'' said Branstad. He said the
governors planned to issue an annual report card on the progress
being made to achieve such goals as increasing the high school
graduation rate to at least 90 percent and creating drug free
schools.
   Foley addressed the governors at the closing session of the
four-day midwinter meeting.
   ``While I commend the president for his desire to be known as
`the education president,' I question whether he can achieve that
goal by proposing a meager 2 percent increase in the federal
spending on education,'' he told the governors.
   ``The simple fact is we don't have a 2 percent education problem
in this country,'' he said. ``The education gap is much more
daunting.''
   He characterized the president's proposal for education as a
``tepid incrementalism'' and said, ``We need bolder action.''
   Foley also told the governors they were living in ``astonishing
times'' that were seeing an end to the Cold War and victories for
freedom from Eastern Europe to Nicaragua.
   He said those changes would result in a peace dividend as the
United States was able to cut defense spending in real terms, not
just reduce the rate of growth as has been the pattern in recent
years. Such a real cut ought to be possible within five years, he
said.
   Foley endorsed the view expressed by the governors that whatever
``peace dividend'' is realized from the reduced spending, about
half should go to reducing the federal budget deficit and half to
social needs, including education.
   ``We will not want, however, for places to spend this money,''
said the speaker.

<HEAD>Regional Bottler Out of Business Because of Contamination Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RENNES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Katell Roc, a regional mineral water
bottled and sold in western France, went out of business Tuesday
after reports that its water was contaminated with hydrocarbons.
   Water quality problems for the small bottler, which employed 35
people at its spring and plant at Lizio in Britanny, arose about
the same time traces of benzene were found in Perrier sparkling
water.
   The plant closure came as the government's consumer watchdog
agency, the National Institute of Consumption, called for labels on
all mineral water to bear the date it was bottled.
   ``The Perrier experience showed the negative effects and
legitimate suspicion that can follow, in case of an accident, when
there is no clear bottling date,'' the agency said.
   Katell Roc President Pierre Mignot suspended work at the plant
Feb. 8, a day after Perrier issued its global recall. There were
reports that contaminated Katell Roc water had ended up in a baby
bottle.
   Katell Roc recalled 1 million bottles and ran tests on samples
to check purity and restore consumer confidence, Mignot said. But
traces of hydrocarbons were found in the bottles, spring and pipes.
Chlorine also was found in the pipes.
   The widespread contamination meant the company could not return
to production, said Mignot, without specifying the nature of the
hydrocarbons or how much money the company had lost.
   ``Our financial situation is untenable. We are only a small
company,'' Mignot said. ``The Katell Roc brand no longer exists.''
   The discovery by a U.S. laboratory that forced Source Perrier SA
to recall 160 million bottles of its popular brand from 120
countries on Feb. 7 has led to greater scrutiny of bottled water.
   Last week, the Vittel mineral water concern recalled 1 million
to 2 million bottles of its domestic Hepar brand after reports that
some had been contaminated with the hydrocarbon alkane.
   The company already had quietly withdrawn the contaminated water
from the shelves, but issued a public general recall of new bottles
to end confusion among consumers, executives said.
   The consumer agency said it had tested 27 mineral waters since
the Perrier recall two weeks ago and said only Perrier showed
traces of benzene or other chemicals above European standards. It
said the results should restore public confidence in spring water
and bottled mineral water.
   The withdrawal has been voluntary in France, with the decision
left to distributors and shops whether to pull the pear-shaped
green bottles off shelves.

   Two federal agencies announced Tuesday they
were joining forces in an effort to rid their lands of booby traps
set by marijuana growers to protect their crops.
   ``We don't like people doing their dirty work on our public
lands,'' Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said Tuesday as he and
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter signed an agreement allowing
law enforcement agents of each department to work on each other's
lands.
   ``With this agreement, we're sending a stronger message that
says to them, `Stay out of our lands,''' Lujan said during the
signing ceremony.
   William J. Bennett, the national drug control policy director,
joined the ceremony, saying he became personally interested in the
problem of drugs grown on public lands when a book he was reading
on Oregon hiking trails included the warning: ``Don't go off the
trail because you might walk into traps, booby traps set by
marijuana growers.''
   The Interior Department controls about 500 million acres, while
the Agriculture Department's Forest Service controls almost 200
million acres, about one-third of the land in the United States.
   Lujan said his department confiscated about 310,000 marijuana
plants last year, while Yeutter said his department eradicated
350,000 to 400,000 plants.
   ``The thrust (of the agreement) is to do it better,'' Yeutter
said. By working cooperatively, he said, the government will ``get
more bang for the buck.''
   Bennett said that at the Cartegena, Colombia, drug summit with
the leaders of Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and the United States two
weeks ago, ``We understood it was our responsibility to take care
of our own domestic drug problem.''
   The National Drug Control Strategy released Jan. 25 calls for
almost doubling the funds for eradication of domestic marijuana
production, to $35 million in 1991.

<HEAD>Journalist, Three Peasants Killed in Wave of Violence</HEAD>

   Two gunmen shot and killed a Colombian
journalist and three farmers she was interviewing, the latest
victims in a wave of assassinations, officials said Tuesday.
   Silvia Duzan, a free-lance reporter, was killed Monday night in
a cafe in Cimitarra, were she was working on a story on right-wing
death squads, said Salvador Pardo, the town's mayor.
   The town, 75 miles north of Bogota, has been the scene of dozens
of assassinations by right-wing death squads.
   Ms. Duzan was the sister of Maria Jimena Duzan, a newspaper
columnist who often writes about drug traffickers and the death
squads they finance. At the time of her sister's death, she was in
New York City to appear in a panel discussion, ``Freedom of the
Press Under Siege Overseas,'' at Columbia University's Graduate
School of Journalism.
   Pardo said the men slain with Ms. Duzan were directors of the
Carare Agricultural Workers' Association. He identified the three
as Jouse Vargas, Saul Castaneda, and Miguel Barajas, and said they
were leading a campaign to reduce violence in the region.
   ``They had all been threatened with death,'' the mayor said. He
did not say who was behind the threats.
   A friend of Ms. Duzan's said on condition of anonymity the
reporter had been carrying out an independent investigation of
violence in the region. It was not immediately clear who she was
working for.
   In the past, reporters were told in Cimitarra that leftist
guerrillas and right-wing death squads have been active in the
region for years.
   The town is located in the heart of the central Magdalena River
region, a base for paramilitary groups backed by drug traffickers.
The groups have killed more than 1,000 people in the last four
years, according to the attorney general's office.
   Drug traffickers who bought large stretches of land in the area
have cooperated with other wealthy farmers in a campaign of
violence against leftist guerrillas and peasant farmers suspected
of supporting them.
   According to human rights investigators, members of the
Colombian military also have perpetrated massacres, torture and
other atrocities in a war against union and cooperative organizers,
leftist leaders, judges and journalists.
   Four years ago, a death squad killed 36 peasants near Cimitarra.
   Ms. Duzan's death brought to 49 the number of journalists
assassinated in Colombia since 1977.
   The killings in Cimitarra were the latest in a wave of political
violence that included the slaying of three city councilmen and a
mayor. Nine died in battles between the army and leftist guerrillas.
   Unidentified gunmen on Monday shot and killed Martinez Mendoza,
a city councilmen in Murindo, 240 miles north of Bogota, the
Antioquia state police said.
   Campos Pinilla, a councilman in northwestern Muzo, was killed
Monday by gunmen in a bar he owned there, the Boyaca state
government office said. The Cauca state police said Lasso Martinez,
a councilman in El Bordo, 250 miles south of Bogota, was killed on
Saturday by a gunman.
   Five men on Monday kidnapped and killed the 31-year-old leftist
mayor of Apartado, Diana Cardona, police said.

   Leftist guerrilla leaders
Tuesday deplored the electoral overthrow of their Sandinista allies
in Nicaragua and vowed to fight on to achieve ``genuine democracy''
in El Salvador.
   The rebels also called for a renewal of talks to end El
Salvador's decade-old civil war.
   ``We certainly deplore the adverse result obtained in these
elections by the Sandinista National Liberation Front, which
nevertheless has emerged as the single most important individual
and influential force in Nicaragua,'' the guerrillas said in a
communique broadcast by their clandestine Radio Venceremos.
   It said the Sandinistas were ``undoubtedly the principal
guarantee for the development of democracy and greater social
justice and popular participation'' in Nicaragua today.
   U.S. and Salvadoran officials long have accused Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinistas of smuggling weapons to the Salvadoran
guerrillas, fighting for power against a succession of
U.S.-supported governments in the past decade.
   The Sandinistas repeatedly denied the accusations, claiming they
provided only ``moral support'' to the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, as the coalition of five Salvadoran guerrillas
groups is known.
   But two days before Sunday's election in Nicaragua, The New York
Times quoted President Daniel Ortega as saying that if he was
re-elected, his Sandinista government would not provide Salvadoran
guerrillas with arms.
   In the interview, Ortega was quoted as saying there was no
military solution to the civil war in El Salvador, and he promised
to adhere to various agreements preventing the flow of illegal arms
across borders in Central America.
   In their statement Tuesday, the guerrillas leaders vowed that
despite the setback in Nicaragua, ``we will redouble our struggle
to conquer an authentic democracy in El Salvador, for which so much
blood has been shed by our people.''
   An estimated 73,000 people have been killed since the civil war
began in October 1979, according to human rights groups.
   The Salvadoran guerrilla leaders also called for a renewal of
peace talks and urged both the United States and President Alfredo
Cristiani's rightist government ``not to obstruct any further
negotiations that can lead us to a regime of democracy, social
justice and lasting peace.''
   Repeated attempts to negotiate an end to the war since 1984 have
failed. The last effort was called off in mid-November, after the
rebels launched an month-long offensive in San Salvador that left
an estimated 1,000 dead.
   The rebels said the Nicaraguan election was clean and honest,
saying it reflected well on Ortega. ``As revolutionaries, we are
proud of the honesty, the responsibility and the vision of the
future our Sandinista brothers have,'' it said.

<HEAD>Teachers Avert Strike By Voting For Legislative Pay Package</HEAD>

   Utah teachers voted overwhelmingly to end
a 10-day ``strike alert'' Tuesday and accept a $211 million
education package, but union officials said they remained
frustrated by low pay and crowded classrooms.
   Eighty-four percent of the 16,000 rank-and-file members of the
Utah Education Association voted not to walk off the job at the
state's 800 public and vocational schools in dissatisfaction with
the legislative appropriation passed last Wednesday.
   But the association's president, Jim Campbell, under fire from
some teachers for his handling of the negotiations, said it would
be wrong to interpret the vote as an endorsement of the funding
plan.
   ``The package was not everything we asked for and the
frustration is still high'' among teachers more concerned about
class sizes than salaries, Campbell said.
   Utah's 20,000 teachers rank 44th in the nation in pay with an
annual average salary of $22,621, and the state's teacher-student
ratio of 25.4 to 1 is the nation's highest. It spends an average of
$2,026 per student each year, a nationwide low.
   The association's board of directors chided Republican Gov. Norm
Bangerter and the Republican-dominated Legislature for having
passed a $38 million tax cut last September instead of giving the
money to public education.
   The appropriation package, which passed by one-vote majorities
in both chambers last week, contains $1,000 pay raises for all
teachers and a 4 percent boost in state subsidies to local school
districts.
   It also authorizes local school boards to boost property taxes
to reduce class sizes. The money could be used for other purposes,
including teacher salaries, if a board certifies it is not needed
for class-size reduction.
   The education association board endorsed the package last week
at the end of the legislative session, but did not lift the
``strike alert'' order issued a week before.
   The teachers voted Feb. 16 to give authorize the board to call a
strike. The next day, the board rejected the education package,
although board members said they wanted to continue talking with
political leaders.
   On Feb. 19, thousands of teachers staged a Capitol Hill rally
reiterating their demands for additional education spending.
   The teachers union never made specific demands of the
Legislature, but did suggest repealing the $38 million tax cut.
Democrats in the Legislature also preferred repealing the tax cut
to the optional property tax hike.

<TEXT>
   Raging seas, whipped up by a storm that has
killed 51 people in Europe, surged through a shattered sea wall and
swamped homes in this coastal village Tuesday.
   Rescue workers wearing rubber wet suits and traveling in
flat-bottom boats helped evacuate 2,000 residents stranded by water
five feet deep.
   Twenty-five people were hospitalized for treatment of
hypothermia, and some people who ventured out to retrieve
belongings from their homes had to be rescued by helicopter as the
tide rose along the north coast of Wales.
   The storm knocked a hole 2,000 feet long in the century-old sea
wall.
   ``We knew about the gale-force winds and high tides, and did
what we could by way of sandbagging, but we could not have prepared
for a breach of this magnitude,'' said Neville Gough, Colwyn
Borough director of housing and technical services.
   Fifty-one deaths have been reported in Europe since the storm
struck Monday: 16 in Britain, 12 in West Germany and three in East
Germany, 10 in France, five in Belgium, two in Switzerland and one
each in Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands.
   In the north of Britain, driving snow and 120 mph winds hampered
efforts to reach an injured climber, later found dead in his
survival bag.
   The weather forced the cancellation of the parade of decorative
floats at the Mardi Gras celebration in Nice, France, and a
fireworks show set for Tuesday night was canceled because of the
fire danger from sparks born by the high winds.
   Residents of Towyn might have to stay out of their homes through
the weekend, said Don Norris, the area's emergency planning officer.
   Throughout Britain, volunteers and rescuers faced similar
perils, exacerbated by power outages affecting 40,000 homes, road
and rail disruptions and fears of sewage contamination and gas
leaks caused by damaged pipes.
   In Kent, southeastern England, houses facing the sea were
battered by waves that slammed pebbles against windows.
   ``There was a lot of noise and thumping and that. We were
already upstairs because the house was shaking from time to time
with the stones,'' an unidentified man told BBC radio. ``We heard a
lot of clatter and then there was an exceptionally great bang and
all the lights went out.''
   Rain brought by the storm prompted the French Secretary of State
for the Environment to issue new flood warnings in already-soaked
east and central France, where floods last week caused pollution in
certain ground water supplies. Environment officials reported that
the Seine was overflowing its banks near Rouen, but no damage was
reported.
   In Corsica, 125 miles off France in the Mediterranean Sea, winds
clocked at 100 mph caused several fires to spread, destroying at
least 30 homes and threatening a primary school and a retirement
village.
   The Association of British Insurers estimated weather damage the
past five weeks, including a Jan. 25 storm, at $4.2 billion. The
earlier storm was blamed for 95 deaths in Europe.
   French and British meteorologists predicted continued high winds
gusting up to 75 mph and further high tides Wednesday.
   Hubert Lamb, a climate researcher at the University of East
Anglia, said Britain's worst storms have come in the last years of
each century. He said the present cycle could be comparable to the
1790s when one storm produced winds of up to 170 mph.

<HEAD>World Bank Approves First of Suspended Loans to China</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank's board, including the United
States, unanimously approved a $60 million loan to China on
Tuesday, the first of seven loans that bank president Barber B.
Conable held back after the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement
last June.
   Conable said after the decision that the bank is now back to
regular lending to China. The bank is the largest single source of
aid to the Third World, lending over $21 billion a year, and China
and India are its biggest borrowers.
   ``You know, China has slowed up its reform program for some very
good reasons and the loans now have to be reviewed,'' Conable told
reporters.
   He has taken the position that World Bank loans to China are
based only on economic considerations. The suspension last June was
to make sure that the Chinese government could fulfill its
financial obligations, he said.
   He added that the bank will be taking up some new loans to China
as well as the old ones, which were to have totaled $820 million.
   The one approved Tuesday will be repayable in 40 years with less
than 1 percent annual interest. For 10 years, only the interest
need be paid.
   The money will go to help farming in Jiangxi province, the
northeastern part of the country. The bank made another loan to
China earlier this month to help repair damage from an earthquake
that occurred after the political crackdown.
   The United States is the biggest contributor but has no direct
veto over loans by the bank, which gets most of its money by
floating bonds on world markets. It announced a bond issue on
Tuesday for 50 billion Japanese yen _ $335.7 million.
   After Conable held back the loans to China last June, President
Bush asked that lending be suspended. Since then the United States
has resumed its own loans to China, and has made a grant to help
American firms meet competition for material to be used on the
Shanghai subway.

   Rowdy country singer Hank Williams
Jr. and his late father shared top Academy of Country Music Award
nominations Tuesday with the 40-year-old weepy saloon duet
``There's a Tear in My Beer.''
   Williams got six nominations, including entertainer of the year,
and the Grammy-winning song collaboration led to five nominations
for his father.
   ``The ones for daddy are particularly important. I want to see
daddy shine after these 37 years,'' Williams said from Paris, Tenn.
   ``I just wish daddy could be there to enjoy it all,'' he added.
``But I feel deep in my heart that daddy's watching somewhere.''
   Clint Black also got six nominations, including best album and
song for ``Killin' Time,'' and five went to Grammy-winning singer
Rodney Crowell for ``After All This Time.''
   Crowell joins Hank Williams Jr., Randy Travis, George Strait,
Dolly Parton and Alabama in the top entertainer category.
   Multiple nominees for ``Hat'' trophies included Alabama, Travis
and Miss Parton with three apiece. Strait, Kathy Mattea, Reba
McEntire, Garth Brooks and the group Shenandoah each had two.
   The 25th edition of the academy's two-hour awards show take
place April 25 in Hollywood and will be televised by NBC-TV.
   Nominations in 12 categories were announced by members of the
band Highway 101, nominated for top vocal group, and Buck Owens,
nominated for the duet ``Act Naturally'' with Ringo Starr.
   ``I feel great. How else could a person feel? It's a sunny day,
we find out we're nominated, it's wonderful,'' said Paulette
Carlson of Highway 101.
   In addition to the top entertainer nomination, Williams was
picked for the duet with his late father ``There's a Tear in My
Beer,'' which also was nominated for top song, record and video.
   Trophies are given to the artist and composer in the song
category and the artist and producer in the record, video and album
categories.
   ``There's a Tear in my Beer'' was on a Hank Williams Sr. demo
tape found in the attic of songwriter ``Big Bill'' Lister. The
elder Williams died in 1953, but modern technology allowed the
addition of his son to the song and video.
   Several nominees won big during last week's Grammy Awards show:
``There's a Tear in My Beer'' was best country vocal collaboration,
Crowell's ``After All This Time'' was country song and k.d. lang
was female country singer for ``Absolute Torch and Twang.''

   The United States is offering too little aid
to Eastern Europe while U.S. businesses are losing out to Japan and
Western Europe on the chance to cash in on a potentially lucrative
new market, three experts on the region said Tuesday.
   ``We almost have a stealth policy toward the region,'' said Ed
Hewett, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, comparing
Bush administration activity to the bomber designed to elude
detection. ``It's hard to find it some days.''
   The United States has abdicated any leadership role in Eastern
Europe by failing to put in the money needed to assure successful
transition to free-market economies, said William E. Griffith, a
political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Until more is done, ``we cannot expect to be taken anywhere
nearly as seriously as we once were, either in Eastern Europe or,
more importantly, in Western Europe or Japan,'' Griffith told the
House Appropriations subcommittee that handles foreign aid.
   It will be up to Congress to boost the U.S. share of aid to
emerging democracies such as Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia,
Griffith said, because the Bush administration has proven reluctant
to provide adequate cash.
   Hewett agreed. ``If we nickel and dime the problem now ... we
will live to regret it,'' he said.
   Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, who is working as an adviser to
the Polish goverment, said while the Japanese and Europeans are
swarming over the area to mine new business opportunities, the
``U.S. business presence is hardly to be seen.''
   Japanese businesspeople are ``all over Europe, putting enormous
resources into study, analysis, contacts ... they realize it could
be an extraordinarily profitable export base,'' Sachs said.
   ``I've been told they are on a first-name basis with all of the
chiefs of the largest enterprises in the GDR (East Germany). ...
One does wonder where is the United States, and why are so many
businesses ready to cede this very large market to other
countries.''
   Poland in particular is crucial, said Griffith. If the new
Solidarity-led government fails in its effort to transform its
economy, it will discredit the idea and discourage other reformers
in the region, he said. ``It is in my judgment close to essential
that it not fail.''
   The United States has won the Cold War with the Soviets but
cannot now give up the effort, he added. ``It would not only be
ironic ... but potentially dangerous if the United States would
once again have won a war and then gone home,'' Griffith said.

<HEAD>Mayor Calls For Practical Help For Media in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY DUNPHY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director general of UNESCO urged the West on
Tuesday to provide practical assistance to independent media in
Eastern Europe as journalists there report about the emergence of
new societies.
   Federico Mayor said the fast-changing Eastern European press
needs help to overcome many obstacles, identified by visitng
editors as outmoded equipment, shortages of cash and newsprint and
the need to train a new generation of journalists.
   ``The media are the arteries through which democracy passes, the
means by which people are informed, policies questioned, two-way
communication assured, political abuses checked _ provided that the
media are free, independent and diverse,'' Mayor said.
   The head of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization made his remarks at the opening of a two-day
conference, initiated by Western press organizations to address
media needs in Eastern Europe.
   Media leaders from 15 Western nations including the United
States and Canada attended the UNESCO conference along with
journalists from Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, East Germany, Romania,
Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.
   The problems in establishing free and independent media in these
countries were considerable, Mayor said, ``particularly when there
is no historical memory of freedom, when the political culture has
to be acquired from the beginning.''
   Mayor said the West could help in five areas: offering advice,
pooling information to avoid duplication, providing access to new
technologies, training journalists and establishing permanent
institutional contacts.
   Several Eastern European speakers appealed for assistance.
   ``We do not have the most elementary practical skill,'' said
Ernest Skalski, editor of the Polish newspaper Gazeta. ``We don't
know how to sell newspapers, we don't know about advertising, we
don't have computers. ... I came here to learn how to get help.''
   Miroslav Philip, editor of the Czech weekly Reporter Magazine,
spoke of the ``catastrophic backwardness of our equipment. We want
to modernize with the help of our neighbors.''
   Encho Gospodinov of the Bulgarian publication Pogled said many
new papers in his country could be profitable if they had more
newsprint. He also said they lack hard currency to purchase
computers and other equipment.
   Other speakers advocated regional approaches.
   ``We have to come together and understand each other if we are
not to lose the new freedoms we have. ... The time has come for
joint publications and joint television programs,'' said Vitaly
Korotich, editor of the Soviet weekly Ogonyok.

   Fire destroyed the home of a construction company
president early Tuesday, and police said they believed radicals
opposing expansion of Tokyo's international airport may have set
the blaze.
   Investigators found two timer devices, plastic vessels and
electric wires in the wreckage of the two-story wooden house
belonging to Teruzo Yoshino, president of Shimizu Corp., a leading
construction firm. Yoshino and his wife were at home when the fire
started at 3:20 a.m. but fled to safety, said a police official
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Shimizu Corp. is building a new airport terminal jointly with
other Japanese firms in a project to expand the airport, which
opened in 1978 at Narita, 40 miles northeast of Tokyo.
   The government plans to build the terminal and two additional
runways by the end of March 1991 at an estimated cost of $4 billion
to cope with existing overcrowding and demands for even more
flights from the airport.
   But eight farmers still live on the planned expansion site and
refuse to leave.
   Farmers and their supporters, including radicals seizing on the
issue for their anti-government activities, have been resisting the
government's plans to expropriate farmland to expand the airport.

<HEAD>Kaifu Names Cabinet Without Scandal-tainted Politicians</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, newly re-elected by
Parliament, formed a Cabinet Wednesday after fighting off attempts
to include scandal-tainted politicians in his administration.
   Kaifu displayed uncharacteristic assertiveness by weathering
intense intraparty haggling over appointments that delayed
announcement of the Cabinet for several hours.
   He also dropped both women named to his first Cabinet, formed
shortly after July's election in which female voters played a major
role in ousting the ruling Liberal Democratic Party from control of
the upper house.
   But he kept his foreign and finance ministers in what political
analysts said was a move to preserve continuity in relations with
the United States at a time of renewed trade friction, and maintain
a steady policy in dealing with a widely unpopular new tax.
   The Cabinet was to present itself to Emperor Akihito later
Wednesday before holding its first meeting.
   The reshuffling came two days before Kaifu was to leave for a
hastily arranged summit with President Bush. The two-day meeting
begins Friday and is expected to focus on U.S. calls for Japan to
radically alter the structure of its economy and ease its $49
billion trade surplus with the United States.
   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama and newly named International
Trade and Industry Minister Keibun Muto held a news conference to
address immediately the trade tensions Kaifu will face.
   Japan ``must maintain good relations with the United States,''
Nakayama said. ``At a time of Japan-U.S. economic friction, we will
make strong efforts in the ... talks. We must promote discussions
for Japan-U.S. global partnership in the 21st century.''
   Aside from Nakayama, the only other Cabinet holdover was Finance
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, an ambitious politician widely regarded
as a future prime minister.
   The backstage wrangling followed Kaifu's re-election Tuesday as
president of the ruling party, and thus prime minister.
   Parliament's lower house, which officially names the premier,
voted to keep Kaifu 286-146 over Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako
Doi.
   The upper house, controlled by the opposition since July, voted
for Kaifu 111-91 over Ms. Doi with 44 blank ballots in a runoff.
   Voter outrage over the tax and the far-reaching Recruit scandal
led to the Liberal Democrats' trouncing at the polls in July. In
the scandal, stocks in a subsidiary of Recruit Co. _ a business
information conglomerate _ were sold to politicians at artificially
low prices.
   The scandal brought down the administration of former Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita and led to the resignation of his
successor, Sousuke Uno, who stepped down to take responsibility for
the July election outcome.
   But Kaifu led the Liberal Democrats to an unexpectedly wide
majority in the Feb. 18 lower house election, giving him and his
party renewed confidence in their leadership.
   Kaifu lacks a significant power base within the party, but
nevertheless insisted on a ``clean'' Cabinet. He stubbornly
resisted former Finance Minister Michio Watanabe's backing of Koko
Sato, an ex-agriculture minister and member of Watanabe's
intraparty faction.
   Sato had been given a suspended sentence in a 1970s scandal in
which Lockheed Aircraft Corp. bribed politicians to influence sales
of its aircraft in Japan.
   Watanabe relented, however, when Cabinet negotiations became
stalemated. Kaifu also rebuffed attempts from another party faction
to include a Recruit-linked member in the Cabinet.
   But Kaifu's insistence on a Recruit-free Cabinet could cost him
heavily, said Takashi Inoguchi, a political scientist at Tokyo
University.
   ``Kaifu's dilemma is that to gain public approval, he has to
assert himself vis-a-vis other major bosses,'' Inoguchi told Kyodo
News Service. ``But unless Kaifu incorporates Recruit-tainted
politicians, major bosses may not cooperate with him.''
   Kaifu, from a small party faction, depends on support from the
big party bosses: Takeshita, ex-Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe and
ex-Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, all linked to Recruit and
heads of the three largest factions.
   Other lawmakers appointed to the Cabinet included former
Agriculture Minister Kabun Muto as minister of international trade
and industry; Justice Minister Shin Hasegawa; Labor Minister
Shunpei Tsukahara; Construction Minister Tamisuke Watanuki, and
Defense Agency Director General Yozo Ishikawa.

<HEAD>Morgan Goes to Court for Passport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge said Tuesday he would rule within two
days on a request to release the passport of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan
to enable her to travel to New Zealand to fight a custody lawsuit
filed by her ex-husband.
   Morgan was jailed in 1987 for more than two years for failing to
reveal the whereabouts of her daughter, Hilary, now 7.
   Her passport request was taken under advisement by District of
Columbia Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon following a 90 minute
hearing.
   ``Keeping Elizabeth Morgan a prisoner in her own country won't
be any more effective than keeping her a prisoner in that little
cell,'' said her attorney, Steven Sachs.
   Sachs argued that Morgan has fulfilled ``every obligation''
since her passport was turned over to court authorities in 1987.
``It is being unlawfully and illegally held,'' he said.
   However, John Lenahan, representing Morgan's former husband and
the girl's father, Dr. Eric Foretich, argued that returning the
passport would only give Morgan ``an opportunity to further defy''
the previous contempt of court order.
   ``She has done nothing to purge herself of the contempt
charge,'' Lenahan said.
   Morgan was jailed in 1987 for 25 months for refusing to turn
over the girl for supervised visits with Foretich. Morgan has
contended the girl was sexually abused by Foretich. He has denied
the charges and claimed that Morgan was mentally ill.
   Foretich and his wife separated before Hilary was born.
   The girl, who has been living with her maternal grandparents in
Christchurch, New Zealand, had been the subject of a 2{-year search
by her father. Officials found her there last week.

   An hour-long version of ``America's Funniest
Home Videos'' beat CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' the first time an ABC
entertainment show has won the Sunday time slot in 12 years,
according to figures released Tuesday.
   NBC won the week that ended Feb. 25 with an average prime-time
rating of 15.1, followed by ABC's 13.7 and CBS' 13.4, according to
the A.C. Nielsen Co. A ratings point represents the percentage of
the nation's 92.1 million television homes tuned into a show.
   The Sunday night broadcast of ``America's Funniest Home
Videos,'' which repeated segments from earlier shows, finished
eighth, while ``60 Minutes,'' without its usual Andy Rooney
signoff, was 18th.
   The last time an ABC entertainment show won the 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.
slot against ``60 Minutes'' was a 1978 special, ``ABC's Silver
Anniversary Special.''
   Here are last week's top 10 shows: NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and
``Cheers'' (tied); ``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``A Different World,'' NBC;
``The Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``Empty Nest,'' NBC; ``The Wonder
Years,'' ABC; ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC; ``The 32nd
Annual Grammy Awards,'' CBS; and ``L.A. Law,'' NBC.
   Peter Jenning's ``World News Tonight'' on ABC won its seventh
straight week in the news ratings, earning an 11.3 rating. Dan
Rather's slumping ``CBS Evening News'' was third with 9.9. Tom
Brokaw's ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 10.1 rating.
   NBC's midseason prime time replacement ``Grand'' was 11th, while
CBS' ``The Bradys'' fell to 69th.
   Fox's ``Married...With Children'' was No. 24 and the newtwork's
highest ranked show last week. Fox's ``The Simpsons'' came in 26th.
Fox said it beat NBC and ABC with ``The Simpsons'' and CBS and ABC
with ``Married...With Children.''
   Several specials did well during the week, with ``The 32nd
Annual Grammy Awards'' capturing ninth place, and the middle and
concluding chapter of ``The Kennedys of Massachusetts'' taking 13th
and 19th places, respectively.
   The annual CBS broadcast of ``The Wizard of Oz,'' followed by a
one-hour special on Tuesday night, was 27th. NBC's movie ``Nasty
Boys'' ranked 37th, but the Friday night premiere of the ``Nasty
Boys'' television series was No. 52.
   ``A Family For Joe,'' an NBC Sunday night movie starring Robert
Mitchum, ranked 22nd, while another version of ``Super Bloopers &amp;
Practical Jokes'' which followed the Mitchum movie, was 21st. CBS'
``Sparks: The Price of Passion'' on Sunday night was 38th.
   Viewers agreed with critics and preferred to turn away from
ABC's ``Challenger'' on Sunday night. The story about the shuttle
tragedy was ranked 44th, with a 12.8 rating, a deep cut from
``America's Funniest Home Videos'' lead-in of 19.4.
   For the season to date, NBC leads the ratings averages with
14.9, followed by ABC's 13.0 and CBS' 12.3.

   President Bush congratulated the San Francisco
49ers Friday on their stunning 1990 Super Bowl victory but
complained the score was so lopsided many viewers tuned out early
and missed his own TV appearance.
   He suggested that a public service message he taped was seen
only by ``five people'' when it aired in the fourth quarter of the
55-10 rout. ``All of them work for me,'' he joked.
   The message, in which he praised the National Football League
for its charity programs, also aired in the first quarter.
   The president honored the team at a White House reception and
called the 49ers' defeat of the Denver Broncos ``one of the
greatest victories in American championship history.''
   ``You clobbered them,'' the president said.
   Noting that the team also had won the 1989 Super Bowl, Bush
said, ``your team is carrying into the '90s the title the
(Pittsburgh) Steelers carried into the '70s _ Team of the Decade.''
   To an East Room audience that included family members of the
team and many politicians, Bush said, ``This last Super Bowl seemed
to have been over some time around the end of the National Anthem.''
   Bush lavished praise on the winner of the game's Most Valuable
Player award, 49ers quarterback Joe Montana, calling him ``Joe
Cool'' and saying: ``Fair to say, he's the most accurate passer in
the NFL. Never thrown a Super Bowl interception.''
   That, Bush teased, was a claim that former Buffalo Bills
quarterback Jack Kemp _ now Bush's secretary of Housing and Urban
Development and seated in the front row at the reception _ could
never make.
   Team owner Eddie DeBartolo presented the president and his wife
Barbara with a ``little present for the youngest member of your
family to help her nights at Camp David to stay a little bit
warmer.'' It was a jersey for presidential dog Millie.
   After the ceremony, running back Roger Craig told reporters
outside the White House that the dark, threatening sky overhead was
``a good sign.''
   He noted that it rained when the team visited the White House
following their 1989 Super Bowl victory.

<HEAD>Blacks Interrupt Council Meeting Over Refusal to Repave MLK Street</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The white-majority City Council refused to
repave Martin Luther King Jr. Street for the 25th anniversary of
the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march, setting off new racial
tension here.
   Angry blacks responded by interrupting Monday night's council
meeting, forcing a recess after the panel voted 5-4 along racial
lines not to repave the street named for the leader of the 1965
march. A re-enactment of the 50-mile march begins Sunday in Selma
and ends March 10 in Montgomery.
   At the council's previous meeting, black council members walked
out after the panel voted down a proposal to alternate black and
white majorities on the school board.
   The city has been the scene of racial turmoil since December
when the school board, also in a racial split, voted against
renewing the contract of Norward Roussell, the city's first black
school superintendent. His contract expires in June.
   Blacks and city leaders exchanged words at Monday's the council
meeting, with white Mayor Joe Smitherman telling the audience to
``shut up'' and ``sit down.''
   Black council member Lorenzo Harrison proposed that the city
spend $17,000 to resurface Martin Luther King Jr. Street in his
district for the march re-enactment.
   Smitherman quoted the city engineer as saying the street
``didn't need it. It would just make it look very shiny.'' He said
each council member had $30,000 for ward projects and Harrison
``had used it on other streets.''
   Council President Carl Morgan ordered a recess, saying the crowd
had become too unruly for the council to conduct business.
   About 50 to 60 blacks waited for the members to return and
didn't leave until Morgan said the panel would not meet again until
its next regular session, on March 5.
   ``A lot of it is being orchestrated to try to get emphasis
placed on this 25th anniversary,'' Morgan said Tuesday of the
disruption. ``Once that period is over the national media will be
out of the picture. The thing is about to fall on its face.''
   Morgan, who is white, predicted that fewer than 500 of the
13,000 blacks in Selma would take part in the march, and said black
leaders have alienated whites.
   Morgan said the city's racial unrest in recent weeks has been
``bad for business. It's bad for industry. But I think it has done
more to solidify the white community, which is a setback, I'm sorry
to say, for the blacks.''
   Perry Varner, one of three blacks on the Dallas County
Commission, said the protesters would keep disrupting the council
until it ``does the right thing.''
   But Smitherman said he expects the council will return to a
peaceful atmosphere ``as soon as the march gets over.''
   ``The way these things go, some of these leaders are trying to
recreate the '60s where you have mass arrests,'' he said.
   Three weeks ago, Selma civil rights activist Rose Sanders was
dragged by police from City Hall when she was arrested after a
confrontation with Smitherman in his office. The FBI has looked
into her allegations of police brutality, but a federal prosecutor
said Tuesday a review of the FBI report is not completed.
   After the arrest, blacks occupied the city's only public high
school for five days and held numerous marches and rallies in
protest of the school board decision and the incident involving
Mrs. Sanders.

   The Bush administration, savoring the defeat
of leftist President Daniel Ortega, promised Tuesday to lift
sanctions soon against Nicaragua and assemble ``significant and
meaningful'' aid to rebuild its shattered economy.
   President Bush met at the White House with congressional leaders
including Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who said post-Ortega assistance
probably would cost hundreds of millions of dollars over five years.
   Nunn suggested creating an ``emerging democracy account'' of
foreign aid for countries such as Nicaragua, Panama and the
fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe.
   The White House said it liked the idea if it meant the
administration would have more flexibility in the way the United
States dispenses foreign aid.
   To the surprise of the administration, Ortega was defeated in
Sunday's presidential election by opposition newspaper publisher
Violeta Chamorro, who was backed by the United States.
   The vote sets the stage for the first democratic transfer of
power ever in Nicaragua, with Mrs. Chamorro taking office April 25
from Ortega's revolutionary government.
   Mrs. Chamorro's chief economic adviser, Francisco Mayorga, will
arrive in Washington next Monday to discuss with U.S. officials
American economic cooperation with Nicaragua, Assistant Secretary
of State Bernard Aronson announced.
   Bush summoned congressional leaders to the White House to chart
a new strategy for dealing with a country viewed for a decade as a
U.S. adversary.
   ``The president indicated that there would be a dramatic and
swift change in policy,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the
assistant Democratic leader, after meeting with Bush. ``What we can
do in terms of aid depends upon what Congress can find, along with
the administration, in a very tight budget situation.''
   Without providing a figure, White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater promised that U.S. assistance would be substantial.
   ``The United States' commitment is strong and enduring,''
Fitzwater said. ``We will develop an aid package for Nicaragua that
will be significant and meaningful. The democratic aspirations of
the Nicaraguan people deserve our support and they will have it.''
   Fitzwater said the United States was examining ``the full range
of economic options aimed at reintegrating Nicaragua into the
international economy.''
   He said Bush would discuss Nicaragua's needs this weekend at a
meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, whose country
has become the world's largest donor of foreign aid.
   Nunn also said U.S. aid for emerging democracies should be
sizable.
   ``After all, we spent trillions and trillions of dollars,
hundreds of billions of dollars, defending the free world waiting
for this day, and now that we've arrived at this day, I think we
should not be shortsighted in our approach,'' Nunn said.
   However, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said he was
``frightened again that we're watching expectations exceed
reality'' on the question of U.S. aid.
   ``I see no political will to enlarge'' the foreign aid budget,
Dodd said. Rather than emphasizing direct cash aid, the United
States should emphasize trade benefits it can provide by buying
more coffee and sugar from Nicaragua, and the reduction of foreign
debts, he said. And Congress may well pay for part of the new U.S.
obligation to Nicaragua by diverting part of the $500 million in
cash the Bush administration will be seeking to help rebuild
Panama's economy, he said.
   In a message that seemed primarily aimed at the Contra rebels
long supported by the Reagan and Bush administrations, Fitzwater
urged restraint in the post-election period. He reiterated a U.S.
call that there be an immediate cease-fire ``under U.N. supervision
and that it be strictly respected by all sides.''
   ``We have always anticipated that the resistance would
demobilize and repatriate under conditions of political freedom and
personal security,'' Fitzwater said.
   In contrast to the skepticism the White House has applied to
statements by Ortega, the administration appeared eager to accept
his promise of a smooth transition of power.
   ``We have the words of President Ortega about wanting a peaceful
and effective transition, and we fully expect that to occur,''
Fitzwater said.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that
prior suggestions of Sandinista unwillingness to turn over power
were made in the heat of the campaign and that, so far as the
administration knows, no such statements have been made since the
elections.
   Fitzwater said the administration would respond to the changes
in Nicaragua's government with a series of steps designed to
normalize relations.
   ``We intend to lift economic sanctions soon,'' he said,
referring to a series of economic and trade sanctions in place
since 1985.
   Fitzwater also said that ``we would expect to return an
ambassador there'' and that ``we are looking at U.S. economic
assistance.''
   Although the United States has continued to maintain formal
diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, there has not been a U.S.
ambassador in Managua since 1988.

   Jim Rennie, a former Toronto Star editor whose
three decades in journalism took him to newspapers in Canada and
the United States, died following a car accident. He was 49.
   Rennie was driving to his cottage northeast of Peterborough on
Monday when his car went out of control near that city, flipped
over a median and skidded into a guardrail. He died later at a
hospital.
   ``Jim was a suberb newspaperman,'' said Star editor John
Honderich. ``His drive, his instincts and his ability to go after
the big story were absolutely first-rate. He knew how to get a
newsroom going.''
   Born James Samuel Rennie in Glasgow, Scotland, he came to Canada
when he was 11 and grew up in Norwich, Ontario.
   After working for The Windsor Star and the Examiner in Barrie,
he joined the Toronto Telegram in 1963 and later became assistant
city editor. He then became executive editor of the Ottawa Journal
and worked there until the paper ceased publication in August 1980.
   Rennie then became managing editor of the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer before rejoining the Star in 1986.
   In two stints at the Star, he worked as assistant city editor,
entertainment editor, national editor, news editor, city editor and
assistant managing editor.
   He twice served as deputy managing editor of the Star, leaving
the paper just last month.
   He is survived by his wife Sandra and son David of Seattle.

<HEAD>Authority Of Nation's Pension Insurance Agency Is Tested In Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's pension insurance agency urged
the Supreme Court Tuesday to leave intact its ability to prevent
companies from abandoning responsbility for worker benefits.
   The high court heard oral arguments in a case seen by the Bush
administration as an important test of the authority of the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a government corporation that insures
the pensions of 30 million Americans.
   At issue is whether LTV Steel Co. will succeed in dumping
billions of dollars in pension costs onto PBGC,
   The court must decide whether PBGC acted properly in ordering
LTV Steel, a subsidiary of Dallas-based LTV Corp., to reassume
responsibility for three pension plans.
   The vastly underfunded plans were taken over by the pension
agency after LTV Corp. sought protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws in 1986.
   But PBGC attorney Carol Connor Flowe told the court Tuesday that
the agency sought to turn the plans back to LTV because the
company's financial conditions improved, and because the firm
entered into a ``follow-on'' arrangement with workers.
   Under the arrangement, LTV and the United Steelworkers of
America agreed that the firm would make up the difference of any
benefits lost to employees because of the pension terminations. The
idea was that the PBGC would pay basic pension benefits to the
workers, while the ailing firm would kick in supplemental benefits
_ $400 per month, in many cases _ not covered by the government
plan.
   But Flowe said such a follow-on arrangement represented an
``abuse'' of the pension insurance program.
   Under questioning by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor about PBGC's
authority, Flowe said LTV's follow-on deal and its improved
economic state by August 1987 each were independent grounds for
turning the pension plans back to the company.
   Congress, Flowe said, provided PBGC with broad powers to restore
terminated plans in 1974 by passing the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act, or ERISA.
   ``What Congress said was that PBGC should make this
determination,'' Flowe said.
   At issue, she said, was PBGC's right to discourage ``unwarranted
terminations'' of pension plans by firms eager to gain a
competitive advantage.
   But LTV attorney Lewis B. Kaden argued that the agency's action
was at odds with the 1974 federal law, which he said was designed
to protect pensioners' rights.
   He said PBGC wrongly determined that LTV could afford the
previously terminated plans.
   ``In order to return all these plans, you have to answer the
fundamental question, which is, `Can the company afford it?' ''
Kaden said.
   If the plans are turned back, at least one them would likely
have to be terminated a second time because it has no assets, he
said.
   ``That kind of ping-pong effect could not have been contemplated
by the drafters of ERISA,'' he said.
   A federal judge threw out the PBGC's order for restoration of
the plans, and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that
ruling last May 12.
   The PBGC already has a more than $1 billion deficit and says the
LTV claims would more than double that figure.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole says the case ``will have
far-reaching ramifications for the retirement security of workers
and pensioners'' across the country.
   The court is expected to rule by July.
   The case is PBGC vs. LTV, 89-390.

<TEXT>
   An American member of a mysterious Hindu
cult has been held in virtual solitary confinement since her
detainment last month by the Communist-governed West Bengal state,
her lawyer said Tuesday.
   Patricia Munday, 38, of Vermont, is not receiving the necessary
medical treatment, according to a petition filed in West Bengal
Court by her attorney, Bholanath Sen. Her hometown was not
immediately known.
   ``West Bengal government does not believe in individual
liberty,'' the lawyer said.
   Munday was detained by the West Bengal police Jan. 27,
apparently for her links with a cult called the Anand Marg, or the
Path of Bliss. The governing Communist coalition is opposed to the
cult.
   Munday is being held in a private hospital in Calcutta, the
capital. She is guarded by police and journalists are not allowed
to see her. The petition asks that she be moved to a hospital in
New Delhi.
   The habeas corpus petition was filed after the Indian Supreme
Court on Friday ordered the government not to deport her. She had
appealed to the Supreme Court to secure her release.
   Habeas corpus requires a person in custody be brought before a
court. It places the burden of proof on those detaining the person
to justify the action.
   ``Ms. Munday has been kept in virtual solitary confinement. ...
She needs better medical treatment, her injuries are yet to heal,''
Sen said.
   West Bengal's advocate general, Naranarayan Goopu, said there
was no need for the court to act on the petition because a similar
writ is pending before the Supreme Court and will be heard Friday.
   Gooptu denied Munday is being held in solitary confinement,
telling the court that police ``have only restricted her movement.''
   Munday, a member of the United Nations team that won the 1981
Nobel peace prize for its work with refugees in Somalia, arrived in
India from Katmandu, Nepal, on a private visit. A mob attacked her
and an associate on Jan. 26 when they were traveling on a
motorcycle near the Anand Marg headquarters in West Bengal's
Purulia district.
   Munday suffered head injuries. The Purulia police, instead of
lodging her complaint, detained her the next day. She later was
moved to the hospital in Calcutta.
   The Anand Marg says it aims to create a social, economic and
spiritual order that will replace both capitalism and communism. It
claims to have branches worldwide.

<HEAD>District Of Columbia Decides To Have `Shadow' Congressional
Delegation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia Council on Tuesday
decided to allow elections of a ``shadow'' congressional delegation
to lobby Capitol Hill for district statehood but declined to
provide money for the positions.
   The action came about one week after a committee voted to
postpone the elections indefinitely, which are scheduled for the
fall.
   The full council has voted three times previously to postpone
the election of ``shadow'' senators and a ``shadow'' representative
after the city's voters approved the lobbying effort in a 1980
referendum.
   The unofficial ``shadow'' delegation would have no voting
rights. The concept was first used by officials from the Tennessee
territory prior to its admission to the union in 1796. The group's
only official duty would be to encourage Congress to adopt
legislation making the nation's capital the 51st state.
   ``This is a major victory for us,'' said Dee Hunter, director of
the Rainbow Coalition's D.C. Statehood office. ``Even without the
funding right now, this will allow the education process _ of city
voters and those around the country _ to begin.''
   Council members said they did not want to include language
providing public money for the positions out of concern for the
city's budget problems and fears that Congress might block the
funds when it acts on the D.C. appropriations bill later this year.
   The measure, however, left open the possibility that money could
be provided later this month as the the council continues
deliberations on Mayor Marion Barry's $4 billion budget plan.
   Barry's budget includes $400,000 for the posts.
   The council defeated an amendment that would have permanently
barred the city from using city money to pay for them. Several
members said use of private funds remained under consideration.
   Last fall, the Senate voted 98-2 to shift $150,000 from a city
statehood lobbying commission to anti-drug programs after Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., criticized the statehood lobbying effort as
wasteful and irrelevant.

   U.S. agricultural exports should total $38.5
billion this fiscal year, up $500 million from estimates made last
fall, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   But the new forecast for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 still
represents a 3 percent decline from an eight-year high of $39.7
billion in the previous fiscal year. The record was $43.8 billion
in 1981.
   ``The upward revision (from November) largely reflected a
3-million-ton increase in expected U.S. coarse grain exports,'' the
report said. ``Prospects for foreign coarse grain imports have
increased, and U.S. corn is expected to capture a larger share.''
   Overall, exports this fiscal year were forecast at 148.5 million
metric tons, up 3 million tons from November and nearly 2 million
tons more than in 1989.
   The decline in value was blamed on ``lower prices for grains and
oilseeds,'' which more than offset the larger export volume.
   Estimates of agricultural imports were raised $500 million to
$21.5 billion, matching last year's record.
   ``December's severe freeze in Florida and Texas has increased
prospects for fruit, juice and vegetable imports,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
   A judge on Tuesday ordered the acquittal of
a Florida social worker accused of failing to report suspected
abuse in the weeks before a 2-year-old boy was fatally punished for
soiling his pants.
   ``No reasonable jury could reach any other verdict than for
acquittal,'' Polk County Judge Jesse Barber said in ordering
charges dismissed against social worker Kenneth Houk.
   The child, Bradley McGee, died from head injuries last July 28
after being repeatedly thrust headfirst into a toilet for soiling
his pants, authorities said.
   Houk, 39, was the first of three Florida Department of Health
and Rehabilitative Services workers to be tried over the child's
death. The misdemeanor charge carried a maximum penalty of 60 days
in jail.
   ``It's over,'' Houk said as he left court. ``All I want to do
now is get back to work and get back to my family.''
   Prosecutors contended Houk twice failed to notify the state
child abuse registry after receiving reports about McGee. The last
call came only weeks before the child died.
   Bradley's mother, Sheryl McGee Coe, 21, and stepfather, Thomas
Coe, 22, go on trial this summer in Fort Lauderdale on charges of
first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse.
   The child was abandoned at a shopping mall when he was 3 months
old and lived most of his short life in foster care until the state
gave him back to his mother and stepfather two months before his
death.
   The judge's ruling came two hours into the first day of trial,
before the defense began presenting testimony. As soon as the state
rested its case, defense attorney Jack Wilkins moved for a directed
verdict.
   ``Hopefully this will lead to a different wording of the law,''
Wilkins said. `` ... People who work for HRS must be given the
freedom to make judgment calls.''
   Prosecutors maintained Houk got a call in December 1988 that
Mrs. Coe was unfit because she was drinking and using cocaine.
Then, a few weeks before Bradley's death, he received another call
that Mrs. Coe had forced the child to eat feces as punishment for
violating potty training, the state said.
   Theresa Jacobs, a key state witness who originally reported the
feces complaint, told the jury Houk had urged her numerous times to
telephone the child abuse registry when she had something to report.
   She said she didn't follow his advice.
   ``He had told me before to call the registry, but I never got
any satisfaction from the registry,'' Ms. Jacobs testified. ``I
didn't see him eat feces. I didn't see the bruises.''
   Caseworker Judy Ross was called by the state to confirm reports
that she relayed the feces complaint to Houk and that Houk failed
to call the abuse registry as required.
   But on the stand, she waivered when asked if she even thought
such a secondhand report warranted a call to the HRS hotline.
   ``I don't think I would know enough at that point to make a
report,'' she said.
   Caseworkers Margaret Barber and Shirley Duboise also are charged
with failing to report child abuse. Ms. Barber, who had been
assigned the Bradley case, faces an additional charge of felony
child abuse, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in
prison.

<HEAD>Bush Restates U.S. Opposition to Shifting German-Polish Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday reiterated U.S.
opposition to any plan to shift the German-Polish border as the
visiting mayor of West Berlin criticized West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl for not offering Poland a similar assurance.
   Bush told congressional leaders that ``we have an unequivocal
position that the borders should remain as they are,'' said Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga. and one of those who met with the president.
   Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the president ``simply
pointed out that our position is firm and that he made that known
to Chancellor Kohl.''
   Bush, who met with Kohl last weekend, told reporters at a joint
news conference Sunday that the United States formally recognizes
the German-Polish border and, under international accords, regards
all European borders as inviolable.
   Kohl acknowledged Polish anxiety on the issue and said, ``Nobody
has any intention of linking the question of national unity with
changes of existing border.'' But he said he could not speak for a
new, united Germany.
   ``The border question will be settled definitely by a
freely-elected all-German government and ... parliament,'' Kohl
told the reporters.
   On Tuesday, Bush met with West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper, who
later said Kohl should have ``said that he and the Federal Republic
wants to guarantee the western borders of Poland.''
   ``Nobody in Germany ... (wants) to change the borders,'' and
Kohl failed to make that clear, said Momper, a member of the
liberal Social Democrat opposition to Kohl's ruling Christian
Democratic Party.
   Nunn agreed.
   ``I am personally disappointed that the chancellor has not been
clearer in this respect,'' said Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee. ``I know there are election considerations (in
West Germany), but this is a matter of tremendous sensitivity not
only to the Polish people but also to all of Europe.''
   ``It just makes a lot of people more nervous than they would
otherwise be,'' added Nunn.
   The current German-Polish border follows the Oder and Neisse
rivers. After World War II, Poland's borders were shifted westward,
with the Soviet Union incorporating eastern parts of Poland and the
Poles taking eastern parts of what was then Germany.

   The son of silent film star Wallace
Reid was killed when his single-engine plane crashed into the
Pacific Ocean a mile off the Santa Monica Pier.
   Bill Reid, 72, of Los Angeles, was killed Monday when the
Long-EZ, a type of home-built aircraft designed by Burt Rutan, went
down in heavy fog, authorities said.
   Reid's father made his film debut in 1910, quickly going on to
become one of the silent movie era's biggest stars. His career was
cut short in 1919 when he was injured in a train crash and became
addicted to the morphine doctors administered as a pain killer. He
died in 1923 at age 32.
   The plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Santa Monica
Airport early Monday, and authorities said Reid was flying solo.
   The cause of the crash was under investigation by the Federal
Aviation Administration. Lifeguard Capt. Don Rohrer said visibility
in the area was about three-quarters of a mile.
   The Long-EZ craft Reid was flying is constructed mainly of
Styrofoam, epoxy, B1 fiberglass and plastics and is tailless and
has a rear-facing engine. Owners and flight instructors have
described it as fuel-efficient and nearly stall-proof.
   Rutan also designed the Voyager plane that circumnavigated the
Earth in 1986 on a single tank of fuel and a new low-cost attack
plane called the Ares that he rolled out Monday.
   However, Rutan stopped selling Long-EZ kits in 1985, citing
liability concerns. Planes have since been built from plans
obtained from previous builders, but authorities said it wasn't
immediately known if Reid's plane was an original or a later copy.

<TEXT>
   Animal rights organizations are
criticizing authorities for issuing an alert that militant animal
activists may have been involved in the slaying of a veterinary
school dean.
   ``The whole thing is so preposterous,'' said Siriol Evans,
spokeswoman for the 280,000-member People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals organization in Washington, D.C.
   ``Unfortunately, somebody is taking this tragic event and trying
to turn it into a press opportunity against animal rights,'' she
said Monday.
   The Knox County Sheriff's Department alerted law enforcement
agencies across the country last week through the National Crime
Information Center computer about rumors that militant animal
rights activists might be planning to kill a veterinarian school
dean each month for a year.
   The advisory followed the Feb. 8 slaying of Hyram Kitchen, dean
of the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine.
Kitchen, 57, was gunned down in the driveway of his home by an
unknown assailant.
   Lt. Larry Johnson, a homicide detective investigating the
slaying, said the alert was based on information that ``was third
hand and was unconfirmed by our investigation.''
   It was intended for law enforcement use only, and not aimed at
frightening veterinary school deans elsewhere or accusing anyone
unjustly, he said.
   ``We put it out for only one reason: we didn't want to sit on
anything,'' Johnson said.
   The matter has been ``blown out of context,'' he said. ``The
proverbial mole hill has turned into the mountain.''
   But animal rights groups were not appeased.
   ``I think it's incredibly irresponsible to name a group of
people whose philosophy is non-violent as suspects simply because
the Knox County Sheriff's Department is stumped,'' said Helen
Mitternight of the Washington-based Humane Society of the United
States.
   ``The whole thing seems quite ridiculous because that type of
action is completely against everything the animal rights movement
stands for,'' echoed Ms. Evans.
   Johnson said he heard from some animal rights groups Monday.
``Just the peaceful ones, who aren't so peaceful right now,'' he
said, adding that because of the flap he worried that ``my dog
might bite me when I go home.''
   Johnson said he also talked with law enforcement agencies from
California to New York. ``I have not come up with any other
incidents since Dr. Kitchen's death or even before Dr. Kitchen's
death that was as violent as this,'' he said.
   Johnson would not say where the animal-rights threat started,
but he mentioned three letters sent to people connected with the
university since Kitchen's death. Authorities have dismissed those
as the work of pranksters.
   Local news media also have recalled the controversy that Kitchen
became involved in when the neighboring Loudon County Commission
agreed in 1988 to sell pound animals to the university for
experiments.
   Kitchen defended the practice as furthering the university's
study of human diseases. Animal rights activists objected, saying
the stray dogs and cats might have become family pets.
   Nancy Howell, a spokeswoman for the veterinary school, said the
university stopped buying animals from Loudon County and never
heard another word from animal rights activists.
   As far as finding a suspect, much less a motive, for Kitchen's
killing, Johnson said: ``We have eliminated some possibilities, but
by the same token we have uncovered other possibilities. Just
things we are not at liberty to elaborate on.''

<HEAD>Havel Suggests Dubcek be Invited to Visit the Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia's president suggested Tuesday a
visit to Moscow by Alexander Dubcek, the Communist Party chief
whose liberal ``Prague Spring'' was crushed by the Red Army a
generation before Gorbachev's reforms.
   In a meeting with Soviet lawmakers, President Vaclav Havel said
it could be part of an exchange of parliamentary delegations, with
the Czechoslovak group led by Dubcek, who now is president of
Parliament.
   As Communist Party chief in 1968, Dubcek introduced reforms
offensive to the Kremlin, which opposed liberalization until
Mikhail S. Gorbachev became its leader in 1985. Soviet tanks rolled
into Prague in August.
   Earlier Tuesday, Havel paid homage to human rights activist
Andrei Sakharov, whom the official news agency Tass described as
one of the few Soviets to openly welcome the ``Prague Spring'' and
denounce the invasion.
   Dubcek's last two official visits to Moscow were humiliating.
The first time, he was a prisoner days after the invasion and on
the second, two months later, he signed an agreement allowing
Soviet troops to stay in his country indefinitely and providing for
a return to hard-line rule.
   He was dismissed as party chief in 1969 and languished in
obscurity until Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution broke the
Communist grip on power last fall.
   Havel met with President Gorbachev on Monday and said they had
agreed all 73,500 Red Army soldiers would leave Czechoslovakia by
July 1, 1991, and might be gone sooner.
   Tass said the first train carrying troops and armor out of
Czechoslovakia crossed into the Soviet Union on Tuesday afternoon.
   Sakharov, a fearless campaigner for human rights and reform, did
not live to see Havel, a playwright scorned and jailed by the
Communists, become president of Czechoslovakia.
   Havel went to the grave with Sakharov's widow, Yelena Bonner,
and added flowers to mounds of others left by ordinary Soviet
citizens who visit the grave.
   After the visit with members of the Soviet parliament's Foreign
Affairs Committee, Havel walked across Red Square, surrounded by
security guards, to the spot where eight Soviet citizens were
arrested while protesting the invasion Aug. 25, 1968.
   He arrived Monday, three days after returning from meetings in
the United States with President Bush.
   Tass said Gorbachev had accepted an invitation to visit
Czechoslovakia. His last visit was in April 1987, when dissidents
like Havel were either constantly harassed or in jail.
   On Monday, Havel and Gorbachev signed a joint declaration the
Czechoslovak leader said would open the way to a new kind of
cooperation between the two nations.
   It calls for relations to be developed ``on the basis of
equality and complete mutual respect for each other's state
sovereignty,'' according to a text carried by Tass.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday fined the anti-abortion
group Operation Rescue, its founder and 10 protesters $450,000 for
violating court orders against blocking entrances to abortion
clinics.
   The contempt fines from U.S. District Judge Robert Ward came in
a lawsuit filed by pro-choice groups over anti-abortion
demonstrations in New York in 1988 and 1989.
   In Los Angeles, 15 members of the group were convicted Monday
after a week-long trial on misdemeanor charges stemming from a
demonstration at a family planning clinic last March. They face up
to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Ward said in his ruling that the defendants in New York,
including Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, knew what to
expect when they violated court orders against blocking clinic
doors.
   Wendy Wright, an Operation Rescue spokeswoman, said she had no
immediate comment on the fines. A telephone call Tuesday to the
group's lawyer, A. Lawrence Washburn, was not returned.
   Ward's ruling stemmed from a lawsuit brought by the National
Organization for Women and other abortion-rights groups against
Operation Rescue and Terry.
   Mary M. Gundrum, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional
Rights who worked with NOW on the lawsuit, said the contempt
actions were pursued to ``give fair warning to those persons and
groups that the court will proceed to fine them if they violate the
constitutional rights of women.''
   Ward fined Operation Rescue and Terry $100,000. The remaining
$350,000 in fines were against a local chapter of the group and 10
leaders and participants in demonstrations. The judge also ordered
the defendants pay the plaintiffs' attorney fees, which had not yet
been calculated.
   Terry and four others were acquitted in Los Angeles last year of
several misdemeanor charges stemming from a protest there. Terry
and two other defendants face retrial on conspiracy charges on
which jurors deadlocked.
   Legal challenges to Operation Rescue tactics of staging clinic
demonstrations around the country have left the organization so far
in debt that it announced Jan. 31 it would close its national
headquarters in Binghamton.

<HEAD>Democrats And Republicans Clash Over Campaign Finance Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers fighting a perception they can be
bought through campaign gifts clashed Tuesday over how to clean up
election financing without yielding an advantage to their opponents.
   Testifying before the Senate Rules Committee on campaign finance
reform legislation it will begin writing next week, Republicans
continued to oppose spending ceilings wanted by Democrats to dilute
the GOP's superiority in raising funds through direct mail
solicitations.
   Democrats lashed out at President Bush's proposals to outlaw
corporation, labor union and trade association political action
committees or PACs and prevent lawmakers from using their campaign
kitties to help defray office expenses.
   ``You are meddling a little bit in the way we run our offices,''
the panel's chairman, Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., told Assistant
Attorney General William Barr, the administration's chief witness.
   Ford complained Bush's proposal would allow lawmakers to augment
their office expenses with money from Senate party campaign
committee accounts where Republicans enjoyed a 5-1 fund-raising
advantage in the 1988 election.
   ``And now you want to use that money to beat us over the head,''
he said.
   As an alternative to taxpayer financing of elections long sought
by Democrats and opposed by Republicans, Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., suggested a public financing scheme using voluntary
$1-a-month contributions through the payroll tax withholding system.
   ``So long as our elected representatives must depend on private
contributions to be viable candidates, our political system will be
suspect,'' Cranston said.
   Cranston is one of the ``Keating Five'' senators now under
investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee for intervening with
federal thrift regulators in 1987 on behalf of the now collapsed
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., and its
owner, Charles H. Keating Jr.
   A Phoenix millionaire, Keating had raised more than $1.3 million
for the political campaigns and causes of the senators, including
nearly $1 million funneled to groups associated with Cranston.
   Meanwhile, freshmen Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Harry
Reid, D-Nev., found little support for their bipartisan compromise
that avoids the spending ceiling issue, curbs but does not outlaw
PACs and gives the Federal Election Commission more enforcement
powers.
   ``This `all or nothing' attitude on both sides solves absolutely
nothing,'' Reid said. ``If we can't agree on PACs and spending
limits, lets us at least reach a bipartisan accord on these other
issues.''
   Other Democrats, however, said they are unwilling to curb the
growing influence of PACs without restrictions on overall spending.
   ``Only in a coordinated package of general restraint on campaign
expenditures do I think that it makes sense to have limits on
PACs,'' House Speaker Thomas S. Foley told reporters. ``Without
campaign spending limits, there can be no reform worthy of the
name.''
   Foley said he would meet later this week with House Republican
Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois, who in December said for the
first time that he was willing to consider a spending cap.
   Since then, however, Michel has been silent on the issue while
the administration and other Republican leaders have maintained
their opposition to any ceiling.
   With or without an agreement, Foley said he will bring a bill to
the House floor in April.
   Ford said the Senate Rules Committee would begin writing a bill
next week using as a foundation a bill by Senate Democratic leader
George Mitchell of Maine and Sens. David Boren, D-Okla., and Robert
C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
   That bill would provide ``voluntary'' general election spending
ceilings ranging from $950,000 to $5.5 million depending on a
state's population.
   Various carrots and sticks to achieve compliance are still being
negotiated behind the scenes. The most likely is a combination of
discount mail and television advertising rates for candidates who
spend under the limit.

   A new winter storm developed Tuesday over the southern Rockies
and snow was scattered over the Northeast, where lingering cold
weather produced record low temperatures.
   Snow fell from southern Wyoming to western Nebraska, western
Kansas and northern New Mexico.
   Winter storm watches were posted overnight for the northeastern
quarter of New Mexico. Rain extended from the rest of eastern New
Mexico to western Texas.
   In the Northeast, snow fell across sections of northern Maine,
Vermont, eastern New York state, Pennsylvania, Maryland and
Delaware. Snow also fell on eastern Upper Michigan.
   In western Pennsylvania, Johnstown received 2 inches of snow and
the Laurel Ridges got 2 to 3 inches, the National Weather Service
said. Syracuse, N.Y., received 2 inches of snow during the six
hours up to 1 p.m. EST.
   Temperatures in the East were generally milder than Monday, but
enough cold air remained to drop temperatures to a record low of 2
below zero in Hartford, Conn., and a record-tying 10 degrees in
Atlantic City, N.J.
   Elsewhere, rain fell across northern Kentucky, southern Ohio and
central West Virginia.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 13
degrees at Presque Isle, Maine, to 79 at Harlingen, Texas, and
Yuma, Ariz.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 29 below zero at Milo,

<HEAD>Senate Won't End Debate on Armenia Genocide Resolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Tuesday refused to cut off
debate on a resolution designating an Armenian genocide, leaving
the future of the measure up in the air.
   It was the second time in two weeks that Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan., has tried _ and failed _ to end a filibuster
against the resolution. The vote was 51-48 against Dole, who needed
60 votes to invoke cloture.
   Dole has pledged to keep fighting for the measure, saying he
might ask for another vote to end the filibuster or introduce the
resolution in a different form.
   The measure, which designates April 24 as ``National Day of
Remembrance of the 75th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of
1915-1923,'' has created a firestorm in Turkey, which strenously
objects to the use of the word genocide.
   Dole, who became familiar with Armenian issues when a doctor of
Armenian descent treated him for injuries he received in World War
II, fought strenously for the measure.
   He said Americans of Armenian heritage deserved to be recognized
for their suffering, and called the resolution a human rights
issue. On Tuesday, Dole met with a group of elderly people from New
Jersey and Pennsylvania who lived through the events of the Ottoman
Empire in the early 20th century.
   The alleged genocide occurred before the birth of the current
Republic of Turkey. The Armenians claim 1.5 million were killed
because of their race.
   But Turkish officials say there was no genocide. They say some
600,000 people, including Muslims and Christians, were killed in
the turbulent times because of civil strife and marauding bands.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., led a filibuster against the Dole
resolution. He began talking against the measure last week, arguing
the resolution would poison relations between the United States and
Turkey, a NATO ally.
   The Turkish government has threatened retaliatory action against
the United States if the resolution passes. If the resolution
passes the Senate it would go to the House, and eventually to
President Bush if both chambers approved it.
   The Bush administration opposed the Dole resolution, but Dole
said Tuesday that White House officials would not object to
softening the language and making it a so-called concurrent
resolution. Bush would not have to sign such a measure.

<HEAD>Safety Board Rejects Move To Reopen Kentucky School Bus Inquiry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board
rejected an appeal Tuesday from a Los Angeles lawyer to reopen its
investigation into the Kentucky church bus crash that killed 24
children and three adults.
   The four-member board voted unanimously to reject a petition on
behalf of Lawrence and Janey Fair, who lost their 14-year-old
daughter, Shannon, in the May 14, 1988, crash. Board members said
lawyer John P. Coale failed to raise any new evidence related to
the crash.
   The board, completing its investigation last March, said the
crash clearly was caused by a drunken pickup truck driver, but also
cited characteristics of the 11-year-old former school bus as
contributing to its severity.
   The pickup driver, Larry Mahoney, was sentenced Friday to 16
years in prison after being convicted of 27 counts each of
second-degree manslaughter and first-degree wonton endangerment and
one count of drunken driving.
   Mahoney's truck, going the wrong way on Interstate 71 near
Carrollton, Ky., slammed headon into the bus, which was quickly
engulfed in flames.
   The board, in rejecting Coale's petition, noted that it had
already recommended improved standards for protecting school bus
fuel systems.
   Coale contended that the bus involved in the accident contained
significant construction and design defects that may have
contributed to the puncturing of its fuel tank and the entry of
smoke and fire into the passenger area.
   The board, in its investigation, recommended that older school
buses used by churches and other groups be retired, since they do
not meet stricter safety standards that have applied to school
buses since 1977.

   President Bush will try to prod Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu this week to a more conciliatory posture in
so-far sluggish talks over contentious trade issues, an
administration official said Tuesday.
   With Kaifu's recent election to the post he held on an interim
basis, the Bush administration hopes he will see fit to bend his
government's trade positions more to the U.S. view, said the
official, who briefed reporters on Bush's upcoming meeting with
Kaifu.
   Kaifu is flying to California at Bush's invitation, for talks
Friday and Saturday in Palm Springs.
   The official said the meeting was conceived to address a
wide-ranging set of bilateral issues and the future ``global
partnership'' of Japan and the United States.
   He said that the two heads of state will not conduct
negotiations as such, but that part of the emphasis will be on
achieving progress in the Structural Impediments Initiative Talks,
which are aimed at addressing the underlying causes of Japan's
persistently huge trade imbalance with the United States.
   The talks on reducing the $49 billion trade imbalance between
the two countries ended Friday with few signs of progress and ample
evidence of mutual frustration.
   U.S. officials conceded frustration and concern, while the
Japanese said the administration had demands more severe than Tokyo
had anticipated.
   The administration contends that because of Japan's focus on its
recent election campaign, which returned the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party to power, the political prodding needed to move
the SII talks beyond such roadblocks was missing.
   ``The SII exchanges have been at the technical level,'' the
official said Tuesday.
   The SII talks are to produce an interim report by April and a
final report in July.
   The administration looked for bolder reform proposals from Japan
after the most recent SII round was postponed for more than a month
for Japan's national parliamentary election.
   Bush also will discuss with Kaifu the prospect of Japanese aid
to help the beleaguered Nicaraguan economy now that its elections
have concluded with the U.S.-backed Violeta Chamorro as the new
president, said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.

<HEAD>Panel Appointed to Investigate Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European space authorities named a seven-member
panel Tuesday to investigate last week's explosion of an Ariane
rocket carrying two Japanese telecommunications satellites.
   Preliminary results of the inquiry will be submitted to the
European Space Agency (ESA) and Arianespace on March 20, the two
organizations said in a joint press statement.
   Jacques Durand, the French director of the Ariane 5 program,
will preside over the committee composed of West German, Belgian,
Italian and French aerospace experts.
   The panel is also charged with recommending ways to prevent
future accidents. Its findings will not be made public before the
reports are handed to the ESA and Arianespace, the statement said.
   Frederic D'Allest, president of Arianespace, has said the
findings of the panel should help reassure customers of Ariane's
reliability despite Thursday's failure.
   The 44-L rocket experienced a loss in power in a booster just
after lifting off from the Ariane launch pad in Kourou, French
Guiana. Technicians were unable to control the rocket and were
eventually forced to abandon the mission.
   The vehicle blew apart over the Atlantic Ocean 1 minute, 41
seconds into flight, the first failure in an Ariane flight since
1986 and the fifth in 36 missions.
   The two Japanese satellites were valued by one of the companies,
the Mitsubishi subsidiary Space Communications Corp., at more than
$600 million.
   Flights of the unmanned Ariane rockets had become almost
routine, with the European consortium capturing more than 50
percent of the world's lucrative satellite launch business.
   Analysts have said Arianespace, the commercial operation that
runs the program for the ESA, must solve the problem quickly to
avoid a loss in customer confidence.

<TEXT>
   Seven years ago, Ramiro Gurdian says,
he was threatened with death for criticizing the Sandinista
government.
   His ranch, Candelaria, the biggest banana plantation in
Nicaragua, was summarily confiscated.
   Now that the Sandinistas and President Daniel Ortega have been
thrashed at the polls, losing by a widespread margin in Sunday's
general elections to opposition leader Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,
Gurdian wants Candelaria back.
   But for now he's hoping for a peaceful transition of power to
the United National Opposition alliance headed by Mrs. Chamorro.
   ``Our position is we have to have a society where all
Nicaraguans have space to live,'' said Gurdian. ``We have to
respect the loser and his rights.''
   As president of the Nicaraguan Union of Agriculture and Cattle
Producers and vice president of the Superior Council of Private
Enterprise _ the two most important private business groups in
Nicaragua _ Gurdian was among those who drafted UNO's economic
program.
   It calls for reprivatizing scores of companies that were
confiscated by the Sandinistas, and have become bloated with state
workers and inefficient through government intervention.
   It also calls for returning confiscated lands without harming
the thousands of peasant families that benefited from the
Sandinista agrarian reform _ which may be a tricky process.
   Businessmen say they know that political stability is essential
for renewed economic activity.
   The Sandinistas, who will form a strong and cohesive minority in
the National Assembly, may fight many of the new government's
moves, and government workers already fear losing their jobs.
   ``If UNO decides to privatize the banking system it could be an
irresponsible act that starts a war,'' said Rafael Solis, a
Sandinista military commander.
   Negotiations between Sandinistas and leaders of the 14-party UNO
coalition have not started, said a highly placed UNO source,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``We can't push them (the Sandinistas) right now because this is
a very dangerous time and they're very tense,'' said the source.
``We have to leave them alone and let them seek a path out on their
own.''
   UNO already has made some policy decisions.
   There will be no Sandinistas in the UNO cabinet, Alfredo Cesar,
a top aide to president-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, told The
Associated Press.
   Party cadres will find themselves out of work, but lower-ranking
technocrats are needed for continuity, Cesar said.
   UNO is putting together a transition team that would include
Cesar and hold conversations with the Sandinistas.
   Thousands of businessmen, technicians and professionals fled
Nicaragua during the 10{ years of Sandinista rule. The exodus of
expertise contributed to a dramatic drop in production levels;
inflation also soared.
   But some Nicaraguans plan to return, Gurdian said.
   Agriculture is the backbone of Nicaragua's economy and the
sowing season starts in April.
   ``Many coffee growers simply did not have the money to replace
broken machinery or the incentives to expand production,'' said
Edgar Arguello, who owns coffee plantations in central Matagalpa
province.
   ``But now we will have more freedom to do, to plant, to expand.
You'll see how production shoots up in just this first year,''
Arguello said.
   ``The goal is that year by year we raise production, depending
on resources,'' Gurdian said. ``In three to four years, we can have
production levels like those of 1978,'' the year before the
Sandinistas took power.
   Negotiations for loans are already in the works; so are talks
with U.S. agro-companies to invest in Nicaragua, Gurdian said.
   Construction also is expected to increase. The need for housing
and for repairs to crumbling roads, communications and other
infrastructure is pressing.
   With state controls over the marketplace loosened and with an
expected lifting of the 1985 U.S. economic embargo, Nicaragua is
poised to become a land of opportunity, Gurdian said.
   ``The people are ready,'' Gurdian said. ``All we're saying is:
Well? When do we start?''

   Thornburgh and deputies said that if Exxon is convicted on all

   However, the government could also seek as much as $700 million
more under federal laws that allow recovery of twice the amount of

Alaska told a Justice Department news conference.
   Thornburgh said the indictment was presented to the grand jury

   The White House on Tuesday dismissed a
published report that U.S. officials had secretly discussed with
Iranian representatives the release of Americans held hostage in
Lebanon.
   ``High-level U.S. officials? Direct, secret talks? No,'' said
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater when asked by
reporters about the report in the London-based Arab newspaper
Al-Hayat. ``Do I expect a breakthrough or anything new happening?
No.''
   The newspaper said that progress was being made in discussions
among the United States, Iran and Syria aimed at gaining the
release of foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified political, militia and
religious sources in Beirut as saying that Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani had convinced the groups holding the 18 foreign
hostages that they should be released now.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said, ``We are not aware of the source of these stories or any
talks that fit this description.''
   He also said that he would not rule out ``meetings anywhere, any
place, any time by anybody on the hostage question. Because there
are meetings happening.''
   By that, Fitzwater said he meant that the administration
continues to follow leads and make contacts in its effort to secure
the release of the eight American hostages. He would not be
specific.
   Fitzwater also said that despite recent speculation on a number
of fronts, the administration knows ``of no new evidence'' to
support hopes that the hostages' release might be forthcoming.
   ``There are no direct talks between the United States and Iran
authorized by the president,'' he said.
   ``I don't know who's talking to who. But I guarantee you I'm
never going to say that nobody's talking, because I know a lot of
people are.''
   ``There are a lot of people around the world talking about
release of the hostages in Lebanon _ people from other countries,
people from other embassies, people on all levels, people we don't
even find out about until after the fact,'' Fitzwater said.
   Al-Hayat quoted Algerian sources as saying that contacts were in
place through non-diplomatic organizations and that Algeria was
itself involved.
   Diplomatic sources in Damascus, Syria, this week confirmed that
the United States had a number of channels for reaching Iranian
leaders.
   Contacts through Geneva were one such conduit, but the United
States most recently has used Syria and Japan to pass messages to
Iran, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The sources said there was not one, specific set of negotiations
under way between the United States and Iran.
   Al-Hayat quoted the leading Shiite Moslem cleric in Lebanon,
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, as saying that he supported
ending the hostage crisis, ``and I bring it up in every possible
occasion because I do not believe in it from the begining.''
   An editor at the newspaper said Fadlallah, spiritual leader of
the Iranian-financed Hezbollah, or Party of God, confirmed that the
United States and Iran were in contact through third parties.
   Some Western hostages are believed held by factions linked to
Hezbollah.
   The Lebanese hostages include eight Americans, four Britons, an
Italian, an Irishman, two West Germans and two Swiss.
   The longest-held is 42-year-old Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press when kidnapped in March
1985.
   In London, Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, said of the latest
reports, ``I think there have been many, many positive signals
being sent and this is one of them.''
   The other Americans are Thomas Sutherland, Frank Herbert Reed,
Joseph James Cicippio, Edward Austin Tracy, Jesse Turner, Alann
Steen and Robert Polhill.
   Al-Hayat said the discussions included the fate of four Iranians
who disappeared in Lebanon in 1982 as well as the fate of hundreds
of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.
   The release of the hostages was believed hinged to a power
struggle in Tehran between the pragmatists and radicals in the
government.
   The pragmatists, seeking foreign investment to rebuild Iran's
economy after eight years of war with Iraq, are viewed as trying to
end the hostage issue to burnish Iran's image.
   Two Tehran newspapers said in editorials this week that the
hostages in Lebanon should go free, and Chief Justice Ayatollah
Mohammed Yazdi said that Iran opposed taking hostages.

<HEAD>Court Hears Arguments on Doctor Who Refused to Treat AIDS Patient</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appellate court considering a lawsuit
against a doctor who refused to treat an AIDS patient heard
arguments Tuesday centering on whether a private physician's office
is a ``public accommodation'' subject to anti-discrimination laws.
   The state Division of Human Rights has accused orthopedic
surgeon Daniel Elstein of Syracuse of violating state
anti-discrimination laws by refusing to treat Ronald Derby four
years ago.
   Derby, who had been Elstein's patient since 1982, died of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome last summer at age 36. He had
claimed that Elstein refused to treat a back ailment in 1986 after
Derby revealed he had AIDS.
   The doctor claims he did not treat Derby because he was not
specially trained to treat AIDS, and instead referred him to an
AIDS clinic.
   A similar case against a dentist was argued before an appeals
court in New York City two weeks ago.
   The central issue in the Elstein lawsuit is whether a doctor's
office is a ``place of public accommodation'' as defined in New
York state's anti-discrimination laws.
   The Division of Human Rights, backed by a coalition of state
civil rights and AIDS rights groups, argued that a doctor's office
meets the definition. The law was intended to prohibit
discrimination by doctors and other medical professionals in
providing medical services, said Albert J. Kostelny, an attorney
for the human rights agency.
   Elstein ``did not restrict his practice in any way except to
exclude those afflicted with AIDS,'' Kostelny said.
   Elstein, whose case is supported by the state medical and dental
societies, argued that a doctor's office is private and not subject
to the agency's rulings. A state judge agreed with Elstein in 1988,
ruling that a physician's office is ``distinctly private.''
   The Division of Human Rights appealed to the court's Appellate
Division. The agency argued that allowing private physicians to
refuse treatment to AIDS patients would force them to seek care at
public hospitals and clinics and ``force a collapse of the entire
public health system in New York State under the sheer weight of
the numbers of actual and suspected AIDS patients.''
   In New York, which has a high concentration of the nation's AIDS
cases, it is especially urgent that physicians not be allowed to
discriminate on the basis of whether a patient has the disease,
Kostelny argued in his brief.
   But Elstein's attorney, Catherine A. Gale, said the case is not
about whether doctors should treat AIDS patients.
   Elstein referred Derby to the AIDS clinic rather than treating
him ``based on medical considerations,'' not because he didn't want
to treat an AIDS patient, she said.
   Deciding whether to treat a patient or to refer him to a
specialist is ``clearly a matter of professional judgment,'' Gale's
brief said. ``A lay body, such as the state Human Rights division,
is not competent to address issues involving the practice of
medicine.''
   In a friend-of-the-court brief, the state medical society said
that while no patient should be refused treatment simply because of
AIDS, an agency of non-medical professionals should not intrude on
physicians' autonomy.
   Gale said a more appropriate forum for such cases would be the
state Health Department's Office of Professional Medical Conduct,
whose board includes medical professionals.
   A complaint about Elstein's refusal to treat Derby was lodged
with the medical conduct board, but an investigation found
insufficient evidence to take action or hold a formal hearing, a
spokeswoman for the office said.
   The appeals court is not expected to issue a decision for at
least six weeks, Gale said.

   Nelson Mandela embraced exiled African
National Congress leaders and seven African presidents Tuesday and
thanked Zambia ``from the bottom of my heart'' for providing the
ANC a headquarters in exile.
   Tens of thousands of Zambians thronged the streets to welcome
the 71-year-old South African black leader, who was released Feb.
11 after 27 years in prison.
   At a state banquet given by President Kenneth Kaunda for 380
guests, Mandela praised black African leaders for supporting the
ANC, and singled out Kaunda as ``one of the greatest heroes, not
only of Africa, but of humankind.''
   South Africa legalized the African National Congress, the main
organization fighting white supremacy, and dozens of other
anti-apartheid groups early in February, before Mandela was
released.
   Mandela said Kaunda gave unreserved support to the struggle of
South Africa's black majority for freedom and political rights.
   ``From the bottom of my heart, I say thank you for all you have
done and are doing for us,'' he told the president. ``I doubt if I
will ever forget my first day in Zambia.''
   Zambia has provided an exile headquarters to the African
National Congress, which Mandela led before his imprisonment, for
nearly two decades.
   Mandela was met at the airport by Kaunda and other African
leaders and world figures, including Yasser Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, and Canada's external affairs
minister, Joe Clark.
   Mandela and Arafat embraced, and Mandela later compared the ANC
to the PLO, saying both were fighting a special brand of
colonialism.
   After his arrival, children of ANC exiles put garlands of red
and white flowers on Mandela, to the beat of drums, as dozens of
guerrillas in green military fatigues looked on.
   Kaunda, 64, current chairman of the six-member group of
``front-line'' African nations bordering South Africa, saw Mandela
last at a meeting of black nationalists in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
in 1962.
   At the airport, Mandela said those who led the ANC in exile
``have ... directed our people to the point where we are on the
verge of a breakthrough in our struggle for freedom.''
   He asked that ``the international community ... provide us with
capital and other resources'' to reorganize the ANC inside South
Africa.
   Kaunda was a peacemaker who tried to persuade successive South
African governments to talk with the ANC, Mandela said, and ``if we
are compelled to resort to arms ... the responsibility for this
lies firmly on the shoulders of the government.''
   The Zambian president described Mandela as a freedom fighter and
``a truly great son of Africa.'' The crowd chanted ``One Africa,
one revolution!''
   Tens of thousands of people, urged to turn out by full-page ads
in government-controlled newspapers, lined the 15-mile route from
Lusaka airport to Kuanda's official residence.
   Many groups, including school children and church choirs, waited
in sweltering tropical sunshine for several hours. They waved green
branches, a traditional African symbol of rejoicing, in the biggest
public turnout in Zambia since the visit of Pope John Paul II in
May 1989.
   Kaunda made Tuesday a national holiday named Nelson Mandela Day
and factories offices and shops were closed in Lusaka, a city of 1
million.
   With Mandela is a delegation of 20 African National Congress
members from inside South Africa.
   Meetings scheduled during his six-day stay include a summit of
the front-line states _ Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania,
Zambia and Zimbabwe _ and talks with several government leaders
from the 49-nation Commonwealth of former British colonies.

   The Pentagon on Tuesday assailed a decision by
House Democrats to force the military to accept more than $850
million in budget cuts that could mean the dismissal of tens of
thousands of men and women by October.
   ``It would be devastating to our forces. It's a really terrible
idea,'' complained Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams.
   The subject of the dispute is the Pentagon's request to Congress
to avoid massive layoffs by shifting $852 million to personnel from
other accounts, mostly for procurement of aircraft, vehicles and
weapons. The cuts are required under the Gramm-Rudman budget
cutting law.
   House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., wrote
Pentagon officials that he has reluctantly decided not to bring
their request before his committee. His decision, which has the
backing of House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., dooms the
request, since his committee is one of four that must approve it.
   President Bush had the option of exempting military personnel
from the Gramm-Rudman law, but he didn't. Aspin argued in a memo to
committee members that while Bush's decision is painful for the
military, the administration must realize that accepting the
Gramm-Rudman cuts meant accepting their results.
   Conceding that his decision ``will cause real pain,'' Aspin
wrote his colleagues, ``If we don't stand firm now, this
administration will have us playing `chicken' with the budget every
year, distorting the deficit reduction process and relying on us to
save it from its more irresponsible excesses.''
   If Congress does not allow the Pentagon to switch the money,
Williams said, rough estimates show that 44,100 to 68,200 military
personnel would have to be fired by Oct. 1; between 32,500 and
32,600 people would be frozen in their current jobs; 57,000 to
67,000 promotions would be delayed and 59,900 to 115,900 fewer men
and women could be brought into the armed forces.
   Currently, there are about 2.1 million men and women in uniform.
   Some members of Congress argue the Bush administration brought
the problem on itself. In last year's budget agreement, the
administration got Congress to agree to four months' worth of
automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman budget law.
   However, Williams argued, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was
directed by Congress in the defense spending bill to request
approval of the transfer.
   Williams quoted the bill as saying the request should be made
``to prevent a return to the 1970s phenomenon of the `hollow' Army
in which many units were substantially undermanned.''
   Williams said the Pentagon has been preparing ``dramatic
decreases'' in force size, but to be executed judiciously over a
period of years.
   ``You don't simply reach in and yank out a certain number of
people in the force. You have to look at the question of
recruiting, people that graduate from military academies,
promotions, people who rotate from one position to another, and the
total size of the force. And you have to do that very carefully and
deliberately,'' Williams said.
   ``This would have an absolutely devastating effect on our men
and women in uniform, if Congress denies us the ability to
reprogram money in the '90 budget in order to soften the blow of
the (spending cuts) on our military personnel,'' Williams said.
   Aspin issued a statement saying the administration last year
``let personnel take cuts, and that made the cuts on favored weapon
systems smaller. Putting weapons before people was their decision
and now they're stuck with it.''
   Christopher Jehn, assistant secretary of defense for force
management and personnel, told the House Armed Services
subcommittee on military personnel and compensation that failure of
Congress to agree to shift funds would be ``a disaster.''
   ``We get the hollowness and fall in readiness that the Congress
itself urged us very strongly to avoid,'' Jehn said.
   ``This makes a pretty good case for the administration to work
more closely with Congress,'' responded Rep. Marilyn Lloyd, D-Tenn.
   ``I suppose so,'' Jehn said.
   Rep. Arthur Ravenel, R-S.C., suggested that perhaps the Pentagon
did not request the exemption back in August knowing that cuts in
military personnel would be an emotional issue.
   ``There is some validity in the premise that some people have
that you all sidestepped the request for exemption at that time
safe in knowledge you'd be in pretty good shape politically this
year with the reprogramming request,'' Ravenel said.

<HEAD>Popular Front Claims Victory in Moldavian Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Popular Front of Moldavia claimed Tuesday it
had won about half the settled legislative races, but runoffs will
be required in nearly two-thirds of the contests.
   The official Tass agency quoted Vladimir Kiktenko, chairman of
the Central Election Commission, as saying 139 of the 380 seats
were decided in the first round of voting Sunday.
   Grigory Petrashko, an official of the Popular Front, said the
movement won at least 65 of those and had called for recounts in
some other races. He did not say how many.
   His organization advocates greater autonomy for Moldavia, a
republic bordering Romania, with which it shares a common language
and cultural heritage. Josef Stalin annexed Moldavia during World
War II.
   Before the election, Popular Front leaders said they hoped to
win about half the legislative seats. It entered candidates in
about 200 of the races.
   Kiktenko said Sunday's vote was the first truly democratic
election in the Moldavian republic's history and the turnout was
about 83 percent.
   He said Pyotr Luchinsky, the Moldavian Communist Party chief,
had 93 percent of the vote, but he did not give figures for other
races.
   Weekend elections also were held in the Baltic republic of
Lithuania, where both the Communist Party and the Sajudis popular
front advocate secession from the Soviet Union, and in the Central
Asian republics of Tadzhikistan and Kirghizia.
   Sajudis won a landslide victory in Lithuania, but most of the
seats will be decided in runoffs.

   Civilians who had run out of food and
water or feared new fighting between rival Christian armies fled
into the Moslem part of the city Tuesday, police reported.
   Sniper fire at the Museum crossing, which links Christian east
Beirut with the Moslem western sector, did not discourage small
groups of civilians from scurrying across the no-man's land.
   Police said most evacuees left the 310-square mile enclave north
and east of Beirut at crossings on the northern and eastern flanks,
leading to the Akkar Plain and Bekaa Valley.
   Christian civilians also fled to the Metin Mountains northeast
of Beirut, which are controlled by Gen. Michel Aoun's forces, for
safer areas in the Druse-held Chouf Mountains and south Lebanon,
police said.
   The battle between Aoun and Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces
militia has killed at least 694 people and wounded 1,930 since it
began Jan. 30. A tenuous cease-fire has been in effect since Feb.
17.
   In addition to the danger of war, the 1 million Christians in
the enclave face chronic shortages of cash, food, water, fuel and
cooking gas.
   ``All civil servants and most of the private sector's employees
haven't been paid their salaries for January because of the
clashes,'' a police spokesman sid.
   Most banks in Christian territory have been closed since the
battle for Christian supremacy began. Police estimate, about
110,000 of the 1 million people have fled.

   A senior official at the Treasury Department's
Office of Thrift Supervision resigned Tuesday, leaving three of the
agency's top eight spots vacant as the Bush administration searches
for a new director.
   Karl T. Hoyle, the senior deputy director in charge of
congressional and media relations, said he was leaving the thrift
office to start his own lobbying business.
   Last Friday, Jordan Luke, chief counsel of the agency, said he
was entering private law practice.
   The agency's chief economist, James R. Barth, resigned last fall
to teach at Auburn University.
   The departures leave only four senior officials at the agency in
addition to its director, M. Danny Wall, who resigned Dec. 4 as the
top federal S&amp;L regulator. Wall continues to serve in his post and
has set no date for his departure.
   They are Jonathan Fiechter, policy director; Darrel Dochow,
supervision director; Rosemary Stewart, enforcement director and
Gregory Rothwell, director of administration.
   Pending the appointment of Wall's successor, the vacant posts
are being filled on an acting basis by lower-level officials.
   The Treasury Department has so far been unable to find a
replacement for Wall, who resigned under congressional criticism
for his handling of the failure of Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association, Irvine, Calif.
   The leading candidate for the job, Frederick D. Wolf, the former
No. 2 official at the General Accounting Office, withdrew his name
last week, complaining of Treasury officials' slowness in acting.
   Wall had said he was resigning to spare the agency from turmoil
which would hamper its work. However, the long delay of his
departure is creating the problem he sought to avoid, according to
an agency official.
   ``Things are slowing down,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity _ precisely what Wall sought to avoid.
   Disarray at the agency comes as two members of the House Banking
Committee, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Jim Leach, R-Iowa, are
preparing legislation that would abolish it and divide its duties
among commercial bank regulators.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Tuesday adopted a
law that establishes ground rules for the country's first free
elections after more than four decades of Communist rule.
   The law calls for elections based on proportional representation
in 12 districts, identical with the administrative division of
Czechoslovakia.
   A party will have to gather 10,000 signatures or prove it has
that many members to be able to run. A party must get 5 percent of
the vote nationally to gain seats.
   The elections are set for June and will be the first free,
multiparty balloting since the Communists took power in 1948. They
lost that monopoly late last year in a peaceful revolution.
   Despite objections by legislators fearful that smaller parties
would be discriminated against by the 5 percent hurdle, the draft
law was adopted on a vote of 286-6 with seven abstentions.
   Earlier, Premier Marian Calfa told the legislature that his
country's economy lagged five to 15 years behind advanced nations
in the West because of decades of monopolistic Communist rule that
had stifled creativity.
   In a key report on the state of the country delivered to
Parliament, Calfa called for energetic measures to stimulate the
economy by introducing market policies, curbing inflation and
privatizing state-owned property.
   ``We must stop the negative trends and take the first steps
toward a better future,'' said Calfa, who renounced his Communist
Party membership this year after being named to head the government
_ the first since 1948 not dominated by Communists.
   ``The GNP growth is estimated at 1.7 percent in 1989, but
considering the `hidden price increases' it is difficult to say
whether there is any growth at all,'' Calfa said.
   Under the Communist leadership, it had become common practice to
repackage a product while increasing its price in an attempt to
hide the higher costs.
   With inflation running at 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent and a
foreign debt of $7.9 billion at the end of 1989, the Czechoslovak
economy is in far better shape than those of some of its neighbors,
such as Poland and Hungary.
   Nevertheless, Calfa called for strict measures to turn the
economy around.
   ``An inevitable condition ... of the entire reform process must
be a highly restrictive fiscal and financial policy with
anti-infaltionary effects,'' he said.
   To achieve this goal, the Czechoslovak government plans to cut
subsidies, improve its tax system, introduce market policies into
the pricing process and open the economy to the outside world.
   New laws allowing private enterprise and the ownership of land
will be introduced before the elections. However, Calfa said
privatization of property should be ``cautious and gradual.''
   He also announced planned cuts in military spending of $600
million in the 1990 budget. Czechoslovakia's military budget
currently stands at $5 billion, representing 8 percent of the
country's GNP, Calfa said.
   ``We know today that integration in the European Community in
the immediate future is improbable, but we want to show quite
clearly that we are attempting that in the long run,'' he said.
   ``We do not want the world to envy us. But we have to do
everything so that our people do not have to envy the world,''
Calfa concluded.

<HEAD>House Committee Passes Bill To Help Rural Communities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rural communities suffering from lost jobs and
declining population would have more flexibility to spend federal
development money if a bill approved Tuesday by the House
Agriculture Committee becomes law.
   Money now placed in three funds _ sewer and water improvements,
business development, or community facilities _ could be shifted
from one use to another depending on the needs of the community.
   Each community would name a local committee to decide priorities.
   Reps. Glenn English, D-Okla., and Tom Coleman, R-Mo., who
drafted the measure, said it solves the problem of differing needs
in declining rural economies around the country.
   English said his subcommittee on rural development interviewed
250 witnesses in Washington and local areas before designing the
legislation.
   ``Each had a different idea on what rural development meant,''
said English. ``One thing they all agreed on was that they wanted
more money.''
   But because of the pressures the deficit puts on the budget,
there is no more money, said English.
   He said his bill allows regional committees to decide how to use
the money that is available instead of relying on Washington to
make the decisions.
   ``Some are going to need more water and sewer work,'' said
English. ``We say fine. Take the money from some other area and
shift it to your needs.''
   The Agriculture Department would still have authority over the
funds, but priorities would be set locally.
   Rep. Charles Rose, D-N.C., opposed the plan, saying it put too
much strain on the sewer and water fund, which is the largest of
the three with about $400 million this year, compared to $100
million for business development and $100 million for community
facilities.
   Rep. H. Martin Lancaster, D-N.C., said communities might divert
money to business develpment and let infrastructure suffer.
   ``I'm afraid water and sewer will get resources only when there
is an emergency,'' said Lancaster.
   Rose offered an amendment to the bill that would have removed
water and sewer money from the pool of funds, but English fought
off his effort by proposing an amendment that limited the amount of
money that could be shifted.
   Coleman said the bill is compatible with a report recently
released by President Bush's Economic Policy Council Working Group
on Rural Development.
   He said those findings showed:
   _Rural America needs help.
   _Federal rural development programs must look beyond traditional
farm programs.
   _Rural development is essentially an economic issue.
   _Economic stress hurting most rural communities is primarily
non-agricultural.
   _Rapid change in rural American demands tighter coordination of
federal rural development programs.
   _Local community leadership is at the heart of any successful
rural development program.
   English and Coleman's bill creates a Rural Development
Administration within the Agriculture Department to direct federal
policies.
   It also sets up an information center to be a clearinghouse for
ideas that have proven successful in some rural communities.
   ``This will help small town America become more competitive in
today's global economy,'' said Coleman.
   Last summer, the Senate passed a rural development bill
sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, that differs greatly from the House measure.
   It has three basic provisions:
   _A $300 million revolving fund that would provide seed money for
businesses.
   _Satellite educational and health communication systems.
   _Improved drinking water.

   Palestinians stoned and beat a fellow Arab to
death on Tuesday after a trial at a village mosque in which he
reportedly confessed to collaborating with Israeli authorities,
Arab reports said.
   It was the second public trial and slaying this month in Beit
Furik, a village of 4,000 near Nablus in the occupied West Bank.
   On Feb. 16, hundreds of villagers gathered and cheered as
another accused collaborator was hacked to death with axes and
knives.
   The army confirmed the latest death and said police were
investigating.
   Also Tuesday, about 200 Palestinian youths were detained by
Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Ramallah after a firebomb
was thrown at a parked car, Arab reports said. The car, which had
Israeli license plates, was not damaged, they said.
   Military officials who insisted on anonymity confirmed the
incident but declined to say how many youths were taken into
custody.
   Meanwhile, several hundred students staged sit-down
demonstrations outside three offices of the International Committee
of the Red Cross to protest continued Israeli closure of
Palestinian universities.
   The protests in Arab east Jerusalem and Ramallah passed without
incident, authorities said. The demonstration in Bethlehem was
broken up by soldiers firing tear gas, and six students were
arrested, Arab reports said.
   The six Palestinian universities have been closed by army orders
for two years. Israeli official contend they are hotbeds of
violence in the 26-month uprising against Israeli rule in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The military commander of the West Bank issued an order Tuesday
extending the closure of the universities until the end of May for
``preventive measures,'' the army said.
   On Monday, the army announced that 16 Palestinian community
colleges would be allowed to resume classes after a two-year
closure but warned they would be shut again if there were
anti-Israeli incidents near the schools.
   The slaying in Beit Furik raised to 190 the number of
Palestinians killed by fellow Arabs during the uprising, most on
suspicion of collaboration. At least 659 Palestinians have been
killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians, and 43 Israelis have died.
   The victim Tuesday was identified as Ali Nasasra, 45.
   Arab reports said Nasasra fled from Beit Furik in 1969 after he
was accused of being an informer for Israel and returned for the
first time Monday, reportedly to visit his aunt.
   They said he was abducted by 15 masked Palestinian activists
wielding axes and swords and brought Tuesday morning to the village
mosque.
   As hundreds watched, Nasasra was forced to confess through the
mosque loudspeaker that he helped arrange Israeli ambushes of
several Palestinian guerrillas.
   ``What should we do with him?'' activists were quoted as
shouting to the crowd.
   In response, dozens of villagers pelted Nasasra with stones and
then chased him back to his aunt's home, where they followed him
inside and stoned and clubbed him to death, the reports said.

<HEAD>Senior Official Says 230,000 Soviet immigrants Expected in 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly a quarter-million Soviet Jews are
expected to immigrate to Israel in 1990, three times the previous
estimate, a senior government official was quoted as saying Tuesday
on Israel television.
   The sudden leap in the estimate, the source said, derives from
the opening of new migration channels that would allow 230,000 Jews
to come to Israel, the television reported.
   The television did not reveal the identity of the senior
official but noted that its estimates on Soviet immigration had
previously been accurate.
   So far this year, 9,441 Soviet Jews have arrived and earlier
Israeli estimates put the number of expected Soviet immigrants in
1990 at 80,000 due to more liberated Soviet emigration policies,
American visa restrictions and allegations of rising anti-Semitism
in the Soviet Union.
   Last year, about 12,000 Soviet Jews settled in Israel.
   At present, most Soviet Jews leave for Hungary and Romania and
are then flown on to Israel after the emigrants reach Budapest or
Bucharest by airplane or train. The report comes immediately
following the resumption of ties Tuesday between Israel and Poland.
   On Monday, Finance Minister Shimon Peres said that Israelis may
have to lower their standards of living to absorb the growing
number of Soviet Jewish immigrants.
   The Finance Ministry has set aside $503 million to absorb 40,000
Soviet Jews in the fiscal year starting in April.
   An equal amount has been earmarked by the quasi-governmental
Jewish Agency for immigrant absorption.
   Israel television reported Tuesday that immigration officials
have called for the scraping of the present budget saying that $10
billion is now needed for absorption in light of the new estimates.

   A Royal Marine commando who admitted
killing his wife and baby boy was released Tuesday by a judge who
told him, ``You have punished yourself enough.''
   Graham Sherman, 21, had been found guilty of homicide for the
shotgun slaying of his wife Michelle, 23, and month-old son Josh as
they slept in their home last November.
   The motive for the killings has not been explained.
   ``It is a strange message to come from a courtroom that the
crime of homicide can be purged by mental self-punishment. Is this
to be universally applied in Scottish courts?'' Brian Wilson,
Scottish spokesman for the opposition Labor Party, said in London.
   ``This is a terrible decision,'' said David Evans, a lawmaker
from the governing Conservative Party.
   The judge, Lord Dunpark, told Sherman the sentence was something
``I don't anticipate I will ever do ... again. I am going to
admonish you on both charges.''
   The judge said the purpose of sentencing is to punish, and to
deter others.
   ``In my opinion you have punished yourself more than enough by
what you did,'' the judge said.
   ``You will have to live with this for the rest of your life. You
don't know why you did it. No one has been able to offer an
explanation as to why you did it.''
   There was no deterrent value in a prison sentence, the judge
said, ``for no one in their right mind would have killed without
reason these two people who were dearest to them in the world.
   ``But that's what you did. There's no point in deferring
sentence for good behavior. You have no previous convictions.
Neither is this a case in which in my opinion a probation order
would help you. It would just keep reminding you of what you have
done.
   ``And the sooner you try to forget this the better. For all
these reasons I admonish you on both these charges and you have my
deep sympathy.''
   A letter that Sherman wrote to his sister-in-law, but never
mailed, was read in court.
   ``I don't expect forgiveness, nor do I expect anyone to
understand why. I have gone over it time and time again in my mind,
and I still can't find an answer,'' the letter said.
   ``If I could turn back time and get rid of this tragedy, then I
would.
   ``You all know that I love Michelle and Josh with all my heart,
and believe me I still do. I can't explain the way I feel now.
   ``It's all like a terrible nightmare, one which I know I will
never wake up from,'' the letter said.

   Contra rebels Tuesday rejected a
Sandinista demand that they disband immediately and said they will
not leave their Honduran bases until the Sandinistas turn over
power to the newly elected Nicaraguan government.
   ``We don't trust the Sandinistas,'' said Israel Galeano, the top
leader of the U.S.-backed Contras. ``They are capable of
relinquishing the government but not power or weapons to the
winners of last Sunday's election.''
   President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of the 14-party
United National Opposition handed President Daniel Ortega a
stunning defeat. Latest returns showed her winning 55 percent to 40
percent.
   Ortega said Tuesday the Contras must disband for there to be a
peaceful transition of power.
   ``We will not return to Nicaragua until the Sandinistas leave
power in our country,'' Galeano said.
   Mrs. Chamorro is to be sworn in as president for a six-year term
on April 25.
   Earlier Tuesday, President Rafael Leonardo Callejas said the
thousands of Contras based near the Nicaraguan border must leave
Honduras as soon as possible.
   ``I don't want to force circumstances in Nicaragua, which is now
going through a period of political transition following a victory
by the opposition at the polls, but these rebels should not
continue to stay in our territory,'' he told a news conference.
   Callejas indicated there was no point in the Contras continuing
as a fighting force against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas.
   ``Now, with the electoral defeat of the Sandinistas, there are
better democratic guarantees in Nicaragua for the quick
repatriation of those who have taken up arms,'' Callejas said.
   Honduran officials estimated there are about 10,000 Contra
rebels and some 42,000 dependents living in makeshift base camps in
southern Honduras, near the Nicaraguan border.
   Most of them had pulled back from Nicaragua after the United
State cut off military aid in 1988, and limited assistance only to
non-lethal items. Most of them have been staying in the area around
Yamales, 120 miles southeast of Tegucigalpa.
   But Galeano said he and his people were in no great hurry to
return to Nicaragua, preferring to wait until Mrs. Chamorro is
sworn in as president.
   ``We will return to Nicaragua when the Sandinistas abandon
power. I believe this will be very soon, once Mrs. Chamorro
consolidates herself in the presidency of my country,'' Galeano
said in an interview.
   ``We are a cancer that no one wants. That is why we should act
with caution before those events taking place in Nicaragua,'' said
Galeano, who also calls himself ``Commander Franklin.''
   Many ordinary Nicaraguan refugees who have not been involved
with the Contras were planning to return home as soon as possible,
before Mrs. Chamorro takes office, a spokesman said.
   ``We all want to return,'' saod Ramon Rivera, a refugee leader
in Los Guacimos, a refugee camp about 80 miles northeast of
Tegucigalpa. ``Many of us refugees are packing our bags to return
to Nicaragua before Chamorro takes over. The great majority of us
will do so afterwards.''
   ``We are very glad Mrs. Chamorro won. We never expected it,''
said Rivera, 56, a peasant farmer who sought refuge with his wife
and three children in Honduras in 1982.
   He is coordinator of the camp, one of more than a dozen holding
an estimated 40,000 Nicaraguan refugees nationwide. The refugees
include 20,000 Miskito, Suma and Rama Indians from Nicaragua's
Atlantic coast, as well as Contra rebels and their dependents.

<HEAD>Bataan Death March Prosecutor Dead at Age 80</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Benjamin F. Schwartz, a U.S. Navy attorney
who helped prosecute a Japanese general after World War II for
organizing the Bataan Death March, has died. He was 80.
   Schwartz died Sunday of heart failure at his Los Angeles home,
said his widow, Lois.
   Schwartz was a Navy prosecutor at the Manila, Philippines, trial
of Gen. Masaharu Homma, who was convicted of organizing the 1942
death march on the Philippines' Bataan Peninsula. Homma was
executed.
   American and Filipino soldiers defending Bataan and Corrgidor, a
rocky fortress in Manila Bay, were defeated by Japanese forces in
April and May of 1942. Under Homma, the Japanese forced an
estimated 60,000 of the soldiers to march about 70 miles to prison
camps. About 10,000 of the prisoners died of starvation and other
mistreatment during the march.
   Schwartz joined the antitrust division of the Justice Department
before the war. He later joined the Navy's Industrial Incentive
Division, speaking to defense plant workers to encourage increased
productivity, before he became a Navy prosecutor.
   After the Manila trial, Schwartz entered private law practice.
He mounted an unsuccessful campaign for state Assembly in 1952 and
later became a member of the Democratic Party's state central
committee.
   In addition to his widow, Schwartz is survived by four children
and four grandchildren.
   Services were scheduled for Wednesday at Mount Sinai Memorial
Park in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, who played a
key role in bringing Corazon Aquino to power, was arrested Tuesday
on charges of aiding coup plotters, and the opposition accused her
of trying to eradicate dissent.
   Military dissidents said the arrest of Enrile was a prelude to
martial law. He helped put Mrs. Aquino in power four years ago, but
now is the only opposition member of the Senate.
   Enrile was among seven people indicted Tuesday for ``rebellion
with murder'' in connection with the coup attempt Dec. 1-9 in which
at least 113 people were killed and more than 600 wounded.
   Enrile's law partner, Renato Cayetano, said he would ask the
Supreme Court on Wednesday to release the senator for his own
safety and because the charges were false.
   Enrile is the most prominent figure charged in any of the six
coup attempts since Mrs. Aquino was swept to power in February 1986
by the ``people power'' uprising that drove the late President
Ferdinand E. Marcos into exile.
   He was defense minister under Marcos but turned against him and
led the military mutiny that prompted the uprising. Enrile kept the
post under Mrs. Aquino, but she fired him in November 1986 after a
coup attempt by his followers.
   On Tuesday, presidential press secretary Tomas Gomez said:
``What we are witnessing today is the effective operation of our
criminal justice system under a constitutional democracy.'' He said
the 160,000 members of the military were put on alert to prevent
``reprisals'' for the action against Enrile.
   Vice President Salvador Laurel described the arrest as an
attempt to stifle the political opposition. Laurel broke with Mrs.
Aquino in 1987 and later joined Enrile in forming the opposition
Nacionalista Party.
   ``The arrest of Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile ... is the height of
intolerance of political dissent, which is the essence of a
functioning democracy,'' Laurel said in a statement. ``The attempt
to simulate compliance with legal processes merely heightens the
hypocrisy of the act.''
   Later Tuesday, a spokesman for soldiers involved in the December
coup said the nation ``should brace itself for the imminent
declaration of martial law.''
   In a radio interview Wednesday, Gomez said that despite his
position, Enrile led ``the numerous attempts at a coup d'etat to
destroy this government of ours.''
   ``When there are no arrests, people say the government is
weak,'' Gomez said. ``Now that the criminals have been arrested,
then we are called vindictive. ... How can we have compassion for
an individual who has repeatedly, time and time again, molested the
peace and stability of our country?''
   Agents of the National Bureau of Investigation took Enrile into
custody outside the Senate chamber after serving him with an arrest
warrant that included the charge of harboring fugitives.
   Enrile, one of the nation's wealthiest businessmen, told
reporters he would ask the Supreme Court for bail, which is not
usually allowed for the charges he faces.
   Indicted with Enrile, 66, were former Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan; Rodolfo Aguinaldo, former governor of Cagayan
province; retired Brig. Gen. Felix Brawner; retired Lt. Col. Billy
Bibit; and businessman Rebecco Panlilio and his wife.
   Three people claimed they saw Honasan and about 100 rebels at
Enrile's home on the first day of the attempted coup. The senator
claims not to have seen Honasan, his former protege, since 1987.
   In a Senate speech before his arrest, Enrile said: ``The regime
of President Corazon C. Aquino has marshaled all its forces in
fabricating charges against me in order to silence the voice of the
opposition in this chamber.''
   As Marcos' defense minister, Enrile ordered thousands of people
arrested during martial law in 1972-81, including her husband,
Benigno, who later was assassinated.
   Aguinaldo, a former army lieutenant colonel, was suspended as
Cagayan's governor for 60 days after telling a Manila radio station
he was sending tanks to the capital to support the coup.
   Honasan, who has been dropped from military rolls, led the
August 1987 mutiny against Mrs. Aquino and played a leading role in
December's attempt. He was arrested in December 1987, but escaped
the next April.
   Brawner, former military commander of northern Luzon, served as
a consultant to the Senate Defense Committee after retiring from
the armed forces in 1989. He is accused of advising the rebels.
   Bibit, security chief of the customs bureau, is accused of
giving the mutineers weapons and food. He was arrested last month.
   Panlilio and his wife were reported seen at Enrile's house with
Honasan on the first day of the December coup.

<HEAD>Soviet Byelorussian Envoy Appeals for $17 Billion in Chernobyl Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ambassador of the Soviet Byelorussian
republic appealed Tuesday for billions of dollars in foreign aid
for the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
   Lev Maksimov, permanent U.N. representative of the republic,
told a news conference that the nuclear power plant accident on
April 26, 1986, has caused ``untold misery and suffering'' among
the republic's people.
   He said death, birth defects and illness related to radiation
have increased, but he could not provide statistics. Medical
equipment and assistance urgently are needed, Maksimov said.
   The explosion and fire at the Chernobyl plant sent a cloud of
radiation around the world and was the worst commercial nuclear
accident in history.
   So far, Maksimov said, foreign assistance in cash, food, medical
supplies and other aid has amounted to only about $6 million, but
little of the aid has come from foreign governments.
   Within the Soviet Union, Maksimov said, the central government
and neighboring republics have contributed the equivalent of about
$2 billion in disaster relief.
   But he said at least $17 billion more is needed in various types
of aid.
   Maksimov said his government urgently needs radiation monitors,
ultrasound diagnostic equipment, endoscopes for examining chest and
digestive tracts and foodstuffs.
   Maksimov said thousands of people have been evacuated and
resettled and another 188,000 should be resettled.
   About 20 percent of the farmland has been contaminated and
tainted soil must be removed, he said. Also, animals contaminated
by radiation must be replaced and more foodstuffs are needed,
Maksimov said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight Americans who helped in the Armenian
earthquake relief effort were honored by Soviet officials Monday
for their actions following the disaster, which claimed 25,000
lives.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin told Americans they had put
``lofty human principles of charity and compassion'' over political
differences when volunteering after the quake hit the Soviet
mountain republic in December 1988.
   Julia Taft, former director of the Agency for International
Development's foreign disaster assistance office, was one of the
eight who received the Soviet order ``For Personal Courage,'' a
prestigious award signed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Ms. Taft, of Lorton, Va., said the Armenians were ``majestic
people.''
   ``I feel we have built a great tomorrow together,'' Ms. Taft
said.
   The quake caused such devastation that the Soviet Unon opened
its borders to foreign assistance for the first time, accepting the
help of thousands of experts, including rescue teams, doctors and
construction specialists.
   More than a half billion dollars in assistance poured into the
disaster area from overseas, marking a change in East-West
relations after years of Soviet propaganda that depicted Westerners
as greedy.
   The other seven Americans who received the honor were: William
Dotson, a quality control inspector for Merck and Co. in
Ruckersville, Va.; Caroline Hebard of Bernardsville, N.J., who took
a team of rescue dogs; Warren Isman, a fire chief in Burke, Va.;
Joseph Johnson, an aerospace engineer from King George, Va.; Neil
Kahanovitz, a surgeon from Arlington, Va.; Frederick Krimgold, an
architect from Alexandria, Va.; and Merton Perry, fire chief in
Miami.
   Aubrey Carlson of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow will also receive
the award for personal courage, officials said.
   Another 109 Americans, including President Bush and Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, received lesser honors.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Argument for Overturning Morris Conviction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Tuesday refused to
overturn the conviction of a 24-year-old hacker who unleashed a
``worm'' program that paralyzed thousands of computers nationwide
in 1988.
   U.S. District Judge Howard Munson set sentencing for Robert
Morris for May 4 in Syracuse.
   The suspended Cornell University student faces up to five years
in prison and a $250,000 fine for unleashing a computer worm that
immobilized an estimated 6,000 computers across the country,
including ones at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, military installations and major universities.
   The Arnold, Md., man was the first person brought to trial under
a section of a 1986 federal computer fraud and abuse law that makes
it a felony to break into and use a federal computer network.
   His lawyer, Thomas Guidoboni, said prosecutors did not prove
Morris had actually broken the law because he technically had
access to the Cornell University computer system where the virus
was introduced.
   But the judge said Morris had entered computer files he was not
supposed to. U.S. Justice Department lawyer Mark Rasch said Morris
had described his own conduct to investigators as a ``break-in.''
   The federal judge also rejected Guidoboni's argument that a new
trial be ordered because a remark by Justice Department lawyer
Ellen Meltzer about terrorism ``inflamed'' a community sensitive
about terrorist acts.
   Meltzer had told the jurors during closing arguments in the case
that they shouldn't thank Morris for prompting an increase in
computer security, just as they wouldn't thank a terrorist for
increased airport security.
   This remark was particularly insensitive in Syracuse because 35
students in a Syracuse University program were killed in December
1988 when a terrorist bomb exploded on Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, the lawyer said.
   But Munson said the ``objectionable'' remark was an isolated
event in an otherwise fair trial.
   Morris, dressed in a gray suit, sat quietly as the lawyers
argued. Guidoboni said it has not been decided whether he will
appeal the verdict.
   During his trial, witnesses testified that the worm did not
permanently harm the computers or computer files, but in some cases
people were unable to use their computers for several days while
the virus was hunted down and removed.
   Morris testified during his trial that he had made a programming
error that caused the worm to go berserk and cripple the Internet
system on Nov. 2, 1988. He said he did not intend to cause
permanent damage to computer files, only to infiltrate the
network's security.
   Prosecutors contended that Morris may not have intended harm,
but that he deliberately broke into Internet and took deliberate
steps to make his worm difficult to detect and eradicate.

<TEXT>
   A man who described himself as a former
mental patient surrendered at a newspaper office in the shotgun
slaying of his mother after telling a reporter she ridiculed him
and withheld a $150,000 inheritance.
   Leslie S. Amison was taken away in handcuffs from The
Globe-Times office about three hours after his 76-year-old mother
was shot Monday night at the home they shared.
   ``My mother liked having power over me,'' the Bethlehem
newspaper's Tuesday editions quoted Amison as saying. ``She
wouldn't let me have my own place. ... She said I didn't deserve
privacy.''
   Amison, 44, who told the newspaper he had been in and out of
mental hospitals for more than 15 years, was charged with criminal
homicide, police said. He was ordered held without bail at the
Lehigh County Prison. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for March
7 in county District Court.
   Amison, who said he was a writer and poet, wandered into the
newspaper office behind a cleaning man. He identified himself to
night editor Kevin Flynn, who recognized his name because
authorities had been looking for him in the slaying of his mother,
Catherine Amison Murray.
   ``I shot my mother,'' Amison was quoted by the newspaper as
telling a reporter. ``She just laughed at me because I had no
rights.''
   The newspaper said Amison told reporter David Josar that his
mother withheld a $150,000 inheritance after his father died in
1986 and that she laughed at him, rifled his computer files, and
read his letters and poetry.
   Amison said he fired a shotgun at his mother, then fled the
house, the newspaper said.
   Police were summoned to the home by a neighbor.
   Flynn said Amison told him he chose the newspaper for his
surrender because police patronized him like his mother. At one
point, Flynn left the newsroom, where Amison and Josar chatted, to
make coffee. He telephoned the newspaper's city editor, who called
police.
   The newspaper quoted Amison as saying his father had him
committed to Allentown State Hospital near Bethlehem more than 15
years ago and he had been in and out of hospitals ever since.
Hospital sources cited by The Globe-Times said Amison was an
outpatient at the hospital.
   Bethlehem is a steel town of about 72,000 people about 10 miles
east of Allentown.
   Amison had urged state legislators in letters to reform state
laws on the mentally ill, the newspaper said. He also had written
letters to the editors of The Globe-Times and The Allentown Morning
Call.
   In a letter to the Bethlehem newspaper dated Jan. 7, Amison
called for more democratic treatment of mental patients.

   A son of slain civil rights leader Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. Tuesday told middle school students that gay
people have ``a problem.''
   ``Our population is really all kind of mixed up right now,''
Martin Luther King III said during a speech observing Black History
Month at Poughkeepsie Middle School. ``I mean, we've got a straight
community and a community we call the gay community. ... We laugh,
but that's real.''
   ``Now something may be wrong in the makeup of that individual if
they happen to be that way. Any man that has a desire to be with
another man has a problem, in my opinion,'' King said. ``And that
applies to any woman who has a desire to be with another woman.''
   King did not talk to reporters afterward.
   An official with a national gay rights group called King's
remarks ``strange and upsetting'' considering the increased reports
of violence against gays nationwide.
   ``The majority of cases are in fact perpetrated by young people
who really don't see anything wrong with anti-gay bigotry,'' said
Karin Schwartz, assistant director of the New York City-based Gay
and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.
   ``His statements won't do anything to confront that belief that
many students have and, if anything, will bolster it,'' she said.
   Poughkeepsie is about 75 miles north of New York City.

<TEXT>
   William M. Beck Sr., a former judge and
speaker of the Alabama House and a longtime friend of former Gov.
George C. Wallace, has died after an extended illness. He was 86.
   Beck died Monday of respiratory failure at Baptist Medical
Center-DeKalb Hospital in Fort Payne, where he lived.
   Beck, a Democrat, was first elected to the Alabama House in 1939
and elected again after World War II.
   He served four years the first time and became a DeKalb County
circuit judge in 1943. Beck gave up his judgeship after about a
year to enlist in the Marine Corps during the war.
   When Beck returned from the war, he was elected again to the
House. He served as speaker from 1947 to 1951, during the late
James E. ``Big Jim'' Folsom's first term as governor.
   During that time, Beck helped push bills through the Legislature
to improve state roads. He became friends with Wallace, then a
freshman representative.
   As governor, Wallace appointed Beck to the state Board of
Education in 1962. Beck served for 10 years on the board and helped
organize the state's junior college system.
   ``In his passing we have lost one of those who contributed so
much to Alabama and to his own area,'' Wallace said Tuesday in a
statement. ``He will be sorely missed.''
   Beck's funeral was scheduled for Wednesday at First Baptist
Church in Fort Payne.
   Survivors include two sons and a daughter.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Again Finds USX Discriminated Against Blacks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The USX Corp. discriminated against 8,000
black job applicants even under the Supreme Court's more stringent
standards for proving bias, a federal appeals court has ruled.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld for the second time
a 1983 U.S. District court ruling that the company discriminated in
the hiring of production and maintenance employees at its Fairless,
Pa., steel mill.
   The federal appeals court first upheld the ruling in 1988, but
was ordered last year to restudy the case by the Supreme Court.
   ``This means that once again the court of appeals has determined
that USX discriminated against a class of black people and those
people are entitled to a significant monetary remedy,'' said
attorney Richard Z. Freeman Jr., who represented the job
applicants. He estimated the ruling could cost the steel
manufacturer nearly $30 million.
   Attorneys for USX did not return telephone calls seeking comment
on the Friday ruling by the appeals court.
   The Supreme Court last June ordered the appeals court circuit
court to re-examine its ruling in light of the high court's June 5,
1989, decision in Wards Cove Packing Co. vs. Atonio.
   The Wards Cove decision said minorities could not rely solely on
statistics to prove discrimination but must link the data to a
specific corporate employment policy.
   The decision also allowed companies to justify practices that
appear to have statistically discriminatory by showing the policy
was a reasonable employment policy.
   In its recent ruling, the appeals court determined that even
under the new, more restrictive guidelines, the blacks in the
class-action suit had proved discrimination in hiring practices.
   The court found that because the positions at issue were for
unskilled workers, ``any able-bodied person should be competent to
perform the job.''
   Since the hiring process was subjective, the interviews had a
``significantly disparate impact on blacks, as the percentage of
successful black interviewees was significantly less than the
overall percentage of successful interviewees,'' Chief Judge A.
Leon Higginbotham Jr. wrote in the appeals court decision.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Fails to Take Action in Sheriff's Moonshine Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARSHALL, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury has failed to indict a
sheriff who was arrested on charges of doling out confiscated
moonshine to friends for medicinal use.
   ``I'm awful thankful this matter is over,'' Madison County
Sheriff Dedrick Brown said after a country grand jury took no
action against him Monday. ``The judicial process has come through
again.''
   Brown, a first-term sheriff who is up for re-election to another
four-year term this year, was arrested Feb. 9 by State Bureau of
Investigation agents on a charge of altering, destroying or
stealing criminal evidence.
   Six half-gallon jugs of the illegal brew Brown seized in a raid
two weeks before his arrest were given to several of his friends,
investigators said. SBI Director Robert Morgan said one of his
agents was present during one exchange at the sheriff's office.
   Brown said 25 or 30 people offered to testify on his behalf that
it's a century-old tradition in the mountain county for sheriffs to
hand out ``white lightning.'' But the tradition will have to do
without Brown.
   ``I don't think it would be worth going through this again,'' he
said.
   The sheriff and county residents said moonshine is used in the
western North Carolina area for home remedies such as cough
medicine.
   Brown, a Republican, blamed Democratic foes for the flap, an
allegation denied by a chief criminal investigator for Democratic
state Attorney General Lacy Thornburg, who oversees the SBI.
   District Attorney Tom Rusher, who is a Republican, said the SBI
arrested Brown without Rusher's knowledge. Rusher said he was
``unable to muster much zeal'' for prosecuting Brown and did not
expect to seek other charges.

   A wall of mud, water and debris swept through
part of a jungle town before dawn Tuesday, leaving at least 21
people dead and about 100 missing, authorities said.
   Army Gen. Jorge Ferreyros, head of the Civil Defense Institute,
said a natural dam formed on the Cachiyacu River broke and a
torrent devastated a portion of San Miguel, a town 425 miles north
of Lima.
   Civil defense officials in Tarapoto, the provincial capital 400
miles northeast of Lima, said a number of residents managed to swim
to safety and 300 were left homeless. Rescue personnel evacuated 34
people to Tarapoto where they were hospitalized with injuries.
   San Miguel has about 4,000 residents, many of them farmers who
raise corn and bananas in the highland jungle.
   Ferreyros said recent rains caused landslides that formed the
natural dam.
   He blamed the landslides on farmers who expand their cropland by
cutting down trees and jungle vegetation on the steep hillsides
above the river.

   A man apparently despondent over a
child-custody dispute took his wife and 9-year-old son hostage
Tuesday at the downtown county office building before surrendering
three hours later, police said.
   John Delay, 35, demanded that he be given custody of his four
children after abducting his wife and his son at gunpoint during a
consultation session with a state social worker, said state Trooper
Lon Fields.
   Delay surrendered after asking to be taken to a hospital for
psychiatric care, and his 32-year-old wife, Linda, and son Shawn
were released unharmed, Fields said. The social worker was not
abducted.
   ``We think he just got tired and toward the end he said he
wanted to go to the hospital, that he had some problems he felt
needed help with,'' Fields said.
   Delay was armed with a .357-caliber pistol but fired no shots
during the abduction at the Montgomery County Health and Civic
Center, which was quickly evacuated. He made several threats to
take his own life but never threatened his family, Fields said.
   Delay had a history of psychological problems and was being
taken to Eastern State Hospital, a psychiatric institution in
Lexington, said Officer Mike Martin of the Mount Sterling police
department.
   Delay also has a 13-year-old daughter, Shelly, and two sons,
Jessie, 12, and Christopher, 2, police said. Shawn had been in
foster care for some time and was placed in emergency custody by
the state Cabinet for Human Resources on Friday.
   Brad Hughes, a spokesman for the state Cabinet for Human
Resources, said the children were involved in a ``child protection
case'' but he declined to comment further.
   Mount Sterling, a town of about 5,000 people, is 35 miles east
of Lexington in eastern Kentucky.

   No party can govern Romania alone and
a coalition would be best no matter how the May elections come out,
interim President Ion Iliescu was quoted as saying in an interview
published Tuesday.
   Iliescu leads the National Salvation Front, which took over
during the uprising against the 24-year reign of Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu, who was overthrown Dec. 22 and executed Dec. 25.
   The Front has been accused of being undemocratic and was forced
to share power after reneging on its pledge not to enter candidates
in the May 20 elections.
   ``Regardless of the results'' of the elections, ``the most
realistic thing is to establish a multiparty coalition to govern
the country,'' Iliescu was quoted as saying in an interview with
Romania Libera, the country's largest-selling newspaper.
   He said the ``majority of parties and political formations are
too weak to govern'' and ``not even'' the Front is strong enough to
do it alone.
   The coalition proposal met with mixed reaction from major
political rivals.
   Radu Campeanu, president of the National Liberal Party, did not
rule out a possible alliance with the Front.
   ``The situation in the country is, and will continue to be, so
grave that such a coalition of different political forces may be
helpful,'' he said.
   Campeanu said, however, that ``there is not a great deal of
ideological common ground'' between the Front and his party, which
favors speedier restructuring of the centralized ecomony into a
free market one.
   The Front's main rival, the National Peasants Party, was less
enthusiastic.
   ``It is impossible to pronounce ourselves in favor of or against
such a coalition before we know what the election results are,''
said party spokesman Valentin Gabrielescu. ``In any case, we would
much prefer a coalition with other parties and are working to
establish an alliance with them before the elections.''
   Critics say Iliescu and other former Communists who ran afoul of
Ceausescu want to retain some aspects of totalitarian rule. They
contend, among other things, that the Front controls television in
a heavy-handed manner.
   Several important parties are working toward an alliance against
the Front. Leaders of the Peasant, Liberal, Social Democratic and
Labor parties say they expect an agreement within two weeks.
   Iliescu was quoted as saying the Communist Party, which
dissolved after Ceausescu fell, was too unpopular to regain power.
   About general policy, he said the government would encourage
private agriculture and business, but keep some large state farms
and industries. He said ways would be sought to introduce more
decentralization and free-market principles to state enterprises.
   Fourteen armored personnel carriers blocking off government
headquarters in Victory Square were removed Tuesday. They were
brought in Feb. 19, the day after protesters stormed and ransacked
the headquarters.
   The Council of National Unity, an assembly of the Front and 40
other parties governing Romania until the elections, passed a
decree Friday imposing stricter penalties on demonstrators who
threaten government or party buildings.
   About 100 students demonstrated outside the Interior Ministry
against the government's handling of the officially defunct
Securitate, Ceausescu's hated secret police.
   Gheorghe Constantin, an organizer of the rally, said the
students from Bucharest University and the Polytechnical Institute
wanted ``to know exactly what has happened to the Securitate, how
it was structured and where every one of its former operatives are
now.''
   ``We are convinced the Securitate still exists,'' he said.
``Some of us still have our phones bugged and have received
threats.''
   On Monday, military officers showed reporters how they had begun
dismantling Securitate telephone-tapping centers and said their
work was proof widespread eavesdropping would not recur.
   Securitate agents tapped tens of thousands of telephones as part
of a vast domestic spying apparatus.

<HEAD>Screenplay Writer Sues Eddie Murphy Over `Harlem Nights'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aspiring screenwriter filed a $35
million federal lawsuit Tuesday against Eddie Murphy, contending
the actor-comedian stole material from him for the movie ``Harlem
Nights.''
   At a news conference, Michael Greene estimated that the movie
has 100 similarities to an original screenplay he wrote for Murphy
in 1988 called ``A Halloween to Remember.''
   Paramount Pictures Corp. lawyer Les Fagen, whose company is
named with Murphy as a defendant, denied the allegation. He said
any similarities were common motifs found in hundreds of movies.
   Greene, 35, of Hempstead on Long Island said he submitted his
copyright script to Murphy in January 1989 and was soon advised
Murphy ``was not interested in it.''
   Greene said the script was never returned to him.
   ``I used to consider Murphy a hero,'' Greene said. ``Now I think
he is an egomaniac. He's out for himself.''
   The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Uniondale seeks at
least $35 million in damages for copyright infringement.
   Both scripts were about 8-year-old orphan boys being raised by
underworld figures, both took place in the 1930s and both included
a corrupt Italian plainclothes police officer, Greene said.
   He said both stories revolved around a duffle bag of money and
both had Murphy fighting with elderly characters.
   ``I'm not going to tell you that he took Michael's screenplay
and put it up on the screen, but he clearly edited it, cut it and
pasted it,'' said Greene's attorney, Steven Legum.
   Fagen said the lawsuit was groundless.
   ``We've reviewed Michael Greene's screenplay and the screenplay
for the motion picture `Harlem Nights.' We find no similarity which
could form the basis for a lawsuit,'' he said.
   In January, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Art Buchwald and
producer Alain Bernheim won a lawsuit against Paramount that
claimed the studio took the idea for the 1988 movie ``Coming to
America'' from a screen treatment by Buchwald.
   Paramount was ordered by a judge to pay the two 19 percent of
the movie's net profits. The amount owed has not yet been
determined.

   Contestants in Israel's national beauty pageant
were in tears after judges announced a winner allegedly picked
ahead of the final event Tuesday.
   The Hadashot newspaper wrote that the 11-judge panel had chosen
18-year-old Ivonna Krugliak, a Soviet immigrant, as Israel's new
beauty queen after interviewing the 20 candidates on Saturday.
   The pageant is sponsored by the mass circulation newspaper
Yediot Ahronot, one of Hadashot's competitors.
   Pageant organizer Rachel Givon denied the Hadashot story. The
green-eyed Krugliak was crowned winner following the final evening
gown and bathing suit competitions Tuesday night in Tel Aviv.
   Mrs. Givon said the judges had not made their decision before
then and blamed the rival newspaper for trying to create a
sensation.
   Before the crowning, Mrs. Givon had said the Hadashot story
caused an uproar among the contestants.
   ``The girls were very much upset,'' she said. ``Ivonna was
crying more than anybody else. She is really a very beautiful girl.
If she is chosen, people will say, `See, we told you so.'''
   Said contestant Sharon Seidnorg, 20: ``This put our morale right
down on the floor. I wonder what I'm doing here.''
   Krugliak will go on to represent Israel in the Miss Universe
Contest and first runner-up Ariela Tessler will represent the
country in the Miss World competion, Mrs. Givon said.

<HEAD>Juice-Company Owners Sentenced in Adulteration Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former owner of a local fruit-juice company was
sentenced Tuesday to two years in prison for selling orange juice
adulterated with ingredients not listed on container labels.
   ``White-collar crime is truly a violent crime because it tears
at the fabric of society,'' U.S. District Judge Milton Shadur told
Edward Boden Sr. in sentencing him to two years in prison, a
$250,000 fine and 1,000 hours of community service.
   Boden, 67, former president and chairman of Bodine's Inc.,
pleaded guilty in December to three felony counts of selling
adulterated food under a plea bargain with federal prosecutors.
   Boden's son, Edward Boden Jr., pleaded guilty to five
misdemeanor counts. He was sentenced to two years probation, fined
$200,000 and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service.
   Boden and his son were two of three former owners of
Chicago-based Bodine's who were charged with selling adulterated
food.
   Roger Walsh Jr., a Texas resident, was sentenced last week to
two years probation and 200 hours of community service. Walsh had
pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts.
   All three were originally indicted last July on 19 felony counts.
   The guilty pleas were entered to charges that specified only
five shipments of adulterated juice and named only grapefruit
solids as adulterants. Federal prosecutors had accused Bodine's of
selling more than 7 million cases of ``100 percent pure frozen
concentrated orange juice'' which actually contained such
ingredients as beet sugar, corn sugar and distilled water.
   Proseuctors said the juice was sold under about 50 brand names
at supermarkets in 36 states from 1978 to 1985.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Durkin said U.S. Food and Drug
Administration inspectors on three occasions discovered Bodine's
was doctoring the juice, but the company continued doing it.
   Prosecutors said that because Bodine's had been cutting the
juice with cheaper ingredients, the company was able to undercut
competitors and increase orange juice sales from $5 million to $100
million during the seven-year period.

<TEXT>
   Joseph Hazelwood exercised bad judgment
in virtually every decision he made the night the Exxon Valdez ran
aground, a veteran sea captain testified Tuesday at Hazelwood's
trial.
   Robert Beevers, a consultant who spent 14 years as a tanker
captain, said the worst move Hazelwood made on March 24 was leaving
the ship's bridge in the hands of a third mate during a hazardous
passage into Prince William Sound.
   ``He created the risk of grounding, of losing the vessel, of
fire, explosion and death to his crew and of pollution that
occurred,'' said Beevers, who testified as a prosecution expert.
   Soon after Hazelwood left the bridge, the Exxon Valdez impaled
itself on Bligh Reef, causing the nation's worst oil spill.
   ``In my opinion, it was bad judgment to leave the bridge ... at
that location, at that time,'' Beevers said. ``Whether it was one
minute or 20 minutes, it was bad judgment.''
   In another development Tuesday, a federal grand jury in
Anchorage indicted Exxon Corp. and its shipping subsidiary on five
counts in the spill.
   If convicted of the two felonies and three misdemeanors in the
indictment, the company could be fined up to $1.6 million, U.S.
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh told a Washington news conference.
   The government could also seek as much as $700 million more
under federal laws allowing recovery of twice the amount of the
proven loss caused by the spill, U.S. Attorney Mark Davis of Alaska
said at the news conference.
   Hazelwood attorney Michael Chalos criticized the timing of the
indictment.
   ``It's interesting that it should be happening now just as we're
finishing the Hazelwood trial,'' Chalos said. ``They waited this
long, why couldn't they wait two weeks longer?'' The trial is
expected to last about two more weeks.
   Nearly 11 million gallons of oil were dumped into the pristine
sound, killing countless birds, fish and other wildlife and
blackening hundreds of miles of rocky shore.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with
second-degree criminal mischief, a felony, and three misdemeanors:
reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and
negligent discharge of oil. If convicted on all counts, he could be
sentenced to up to 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   In the trial's fourth week, Beevers offered the most direct
criticism yet of Hazelwood, giving him bad marks on such actions as
his last-minute arrival before sailing, a hasty decision to divert
the tanker from shipping lanes to avoid ice and transferring
control to the third mate shortly before the ship rammed the reef.
   Hazelwood's attorneys objected repeatedly to the testimony,
saying he is not charged with exercising bad judgment and that
Beevers' opinions were irrelevant. But Superior Court Judge Karl
Johnstone allowed the testimony to continue and reprimanded
Hazelwood lawyer Dick Madson after a pointed exchange with Beevers.
   Madson rose from his chair to cross-examine Beevers and
declared, ``Am I standing here before the eyes of God?''
   ``Mr. Beevers, you're not perfect, are you?'' Madson asked
Beevers.
   ``No, I'm not,'' Beevers responded.
   ``And have you ever had someone hired to say you exercised bad
judgment?'' said Madson.
   ``No,'' said Beevers.
   Beevers, who spent four hours on the witness stand and was to
continue Wednesday, said he is being paid $35,000 for helping in
the case. He retired from the merchant marine in 1987.
   Beevers was especially critical of Hazelwood's decision to leave
third mate Gregory Cousins alone on the bridge with a helmsman.
   The witness portrayed Cousins as a mate far too inexperienced to
be left with such a task, noting that he had only 13 months of sea
experience on his license.
   ``He was heading into a dangerous situation, a situation that
needed someone with experience to maneuver it, a situation that was
beyond what you would expect a relatively inexperienced third mate
to do on his own,'' Beevers said.
   He also criticized Hazelwood for leaving at the wheel a helmsman
who had problems with steering.

   Revelers in well-worn costumes jammed
shoulder to shoulder in the French Quarter as the raucous,
hard-drinking pre-Lent party known as Mardi Gras blasted on into
the night Tuesday.
   ``Our closing line would be, `Have a good time, but get out
alive.' With these costumes, we'll be lucky to,'' said Chris
Collins, who was costumed as Batman and was accompanied by a friend
dressed as Superman.
   Collins, who said he was from Pennsylvania but didn't want to
give his hometown, said he and his friend had gotten some razzing,
but most of it was good-natured.
   People in costumes that were gaudy, skimpy or both had filled
the Quarter earlier.
   But as the night wore on, maskers gave way to the unmasked: torn
shirts, tattered grass skirts through which pants were clearly
visible, and garish clothes that might have been part of a costume
earlier in the day.
   Live or recorded music blasted out of every club and hotel on
Bourbon Street and nearby streets, and most of the partiers carried
drinks in plastic cups.
   Batman costumes could be seen all around the city, but most had
more pieces than Eric Wright's. At 9 a.m., Wright stood outside a
Bourbon Street bar wearing wearing only a big grin and a leather
athletic supporter with a plastic bat attached while people around
him filled frame after frame of videotape or film.
   ``Batman. I'm Batman get it?'' Wright said.
   Tracy Jones of Nashville, Tenn., was among those taking pictures.
   ``If I'd come here when I was 20, it would have ruined me for
life,'' said Jones, 43. ``I can barely stand it now.''
   The weather was glorious this year, with temperatures in the
70s. It brought out an estimated 1 million locals and tourists,
police said.
   Mardi Gras, French for fat Tuesday, is the last day of the
Carnival season, which ends with the start of Ash Wednesday at
midnight. Celebrations in heavily Catholic Louisiana began Jan. 6
but reached a frenzy more than a week ago.
   ``Honey, even if you don't have it you flaunt it on Mardi Gras.
What's that saying? Less is more. That's definitely true,'' said
Jim Owen of Los Angeles, dressed in a tight black miniskirt, tennis
ball-stuffed bra, and high heels.
   Along the balconies in the French Quarter revelers dropped beads
to celebrants below and women bared their breasts to the delight of
onlookers.
   ``Well, technically, dropping beads is illegal but showing their
breasts isn't, or at least we don't arrest them for it. In fact we
pretty much just let it all roll by unless someone gets too out of
control,'' said police officer M.L. Sposito.
   David Donze of New Orleans, who dressed as St. Michael the
Archangel, complete with handmade feather wings and golden sandals,
said costuming for Mardi Gras made everyone a star.
   ``It's your turn to be seen by other people. Instead of watching
the parade, you are the parade. You become the parade and the
center of attention,'' he said.
   Dozens of parades draw the focus to the Carnival season, with 15
organizations on the streets all day uptown and downtown _ starting
with the club called Zulu which tossed painted coconuts and beads
to the crowds.
   Next came Rex, the king of Carnival, with his parades down St.
Charles Avenue.
   ``It's New Orleans' mission to see to it that everyone in the
world has plastic beads, plastic cups and rubber chickens. The
stuff they throw from the parades is no good, but everyone wants
it,'' said Rita Miller.
   Miller, from suburban Metairie, and 20 of her friends, all
dressed as clowns, had a front-row seat for the parades. Spectators
15 deep lined the route behind them, clamoring for the trinkets
thrown from the floats.
   In contrast, dozens of Christian evangelists carried signs and
handed out religious leaflets as they worked the crowds.
   ``Our motto is save a soul, don't catch the beads,'' said Laura
Patterson of New York.

   Firefighters had the fire under control within 45 minutes of the
first alarm at 5:30 p.m., Mulligan said.
   The 15 officers suffered smoke inhalation as they tried to

   The priest who founded Covenant House, the
nation's largest organization for runaway youths, resigned Tuesday
after months of disputing allegations of sexual misconduct.
   ``The controversy that has surrounded me for the past three
months has made it impossible for me to lead Covenant House
effectively,'' the Rev. Bruce Ritter said in a statement.
   Frank Macchiarola, the former city schools chancellor who served
as acting president while the allegations were investigated, also
resigned.
   Macchiarola, who was named acting president Feb. 7, said in a
statement he was resigning because the shelter's board of directors
had voted against his proposals for the future of Covenant House.
   A spokeswoman for Macchiarola, Maureen Connelly, said he was not
available for interviews but said Macchiarola had wanted to conduct
reviews, investigations and audits of current practices and make
changes.
   James J. Harnett, executive vice president and chief operating
officer, will take over the shelter until a permanent successor to
Ritter is found, the organization said in a statement.
   In an interview, Harnett said he expected that the international
search for a successor to the Franciscan priest would probably take
months and would be limited to Roman Catholic nuns, brothers and
priests.
   ``The focus has got to be on the needs of the kids,'' he said.
``Covenant House is not one man. It's not me, it's not Father
Ritter. He was not all of Covenant House.''
   Harnett, 43, said the shelter board accepted Macchiarola's
recommendations, and plans to bring in outside consultants to
revamp operating procedures.
   The charges against Ritter first arose in December, when the New
York Post quoted a onetime male prostitute as saying he had had an
affair with Ritter over several months last year. The young man's
father defended Ritter, calling his son an emotionally troubled
liar. Covenant House later conceded that it had provided the young
man, Kevin Kite, with a new identity, using a birth certificate of
a 10-year-old boy who died in 1980 without permission from the
child's parents.
   Earlier this year, three more young men were quoted in published
reports as saying they had had affairs with Ritter.
   Ritter, a man who was once celebrated by President Reagan as a
hero and who served on the Meese Commission on Pornography, has
called the accusations against him ``garbage.''
   Covenant House began in 1968, when Ritter, now 62, put a few
runaways up in his apartment. It now serves 25,000 youths annually
at 17 shelters in the United States, Canada and Latin America.
Nearly all of its $85 million-a-year budget is funded by private

   In letters to potential donors, Ritter detailed the lives of
youths who left abusive homes for a street life of drugs and
prostitution, but finally found peace at Covenant House.
   Since the controversy about Ritter began, contributions were
said to have fallen off.
   Harnett said the controversies of recent months have ``been very

   ``But his vision, his courage and determination remain,''
Harnett said.

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Calls for New General Election</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung called
Tuesday for early general elections as a referendum on the
controversial merger of President Roh Tae-woo's ruling Democratic
Justice Party with two opposition groups.
   Speaking before the National Assembly as head of the Party for
Peace and Democracy _ the sole opposition party remaining _ Kim
said a general election for national legislators should be held
with local elections, tentatively scheduled for June.
   The next scheduled general election is set for 1992.
   Roh's governing party disbanded earlier this month to form a new
giant ruling party with the No. 2 opposition Reunification
Democratic Party, led by Kim Young-sam, and the No. 3 opposition
New Democratic Republican Party, headed by Kim Jong-pil.
   Kim Dae-jung called the merger a ``political coup d'etat'' and
``a breach of contract'' with voters who had voted for members of
some political parties that no longer exist.
   Park Hee-tae, spokesman for the governing party, said Kim's
proposal would create confusion. ``We are convinced that the merger
is supported by the people and is the way to save the country,'' he
said.
   Roh and the other opposition leaders have said the merger was
necessary to end strife among the parties and achieve political,
social and economic stability.
   The new ruling Democratic Liberal Party controls more than
two-thirds of the 299-seat National Assembly, easily enough to pass
government-backed legislation or change the constitution.
   Radical students, workers and dissidents have staged
demonstrations, some of them violent, in Seoul and other cities to
protest the party merger.
   About 900 people, some from the now defunct opposition parties,
met Tuesday in Seoul to form a new opposition party tenatively
named the Democratic Party.

   The Bush administration, hoping to boost
reconciliation in Nicaragua after opposition candidate Violeta
Chamorro's election win, is telling the Contra rebels to ``cool
it'' and avoid provoking a hostile Sandinista response, U.S.
officials say.
   Shortly after Mrs. Chamorro's victory was confirmed Monday, the
State Department asked Chris Arcos, the U.S. ambassador to
Honduras, to go to the Contra camps in southern Honduras to make
clear the U.S. view on the need for restraint, the officials said.
   An additional envoy was expected to be sent from Washington,
according to the officials.
   The concern is that the bitterness generated by almost 10 years
of warfare, leading to an estimated 30,000 dead, could lead to
excesses by revenge-seeking Contras.

   The government is refusing to send its AIDS
researchers into court to shed light on allegations that drug
companies failed to move swiftly enough to prevent their blood
products from transmitting the virus to children with hemophilia.
   The Centers for Disease Control contends AIDS researchers' time
is better spent in the laboratory. Lawyers for families of the AIDS
victims say they believe both justice and science can be served by
having the experts testify.
   ``Parents whose hemophiliac children have gotten AIDS from
AIDS-contaminated blood are shocked that the federal government is
refusing access to the truth about what information was given to
people in the blood business in the early 1980s about the
transmissibility of AIDS,'' said Laura Anderson, a Miami attorney
for families who are suing Armour Pharmaceutical of Bradley, Ill.,
and Cutter Laboratories of Berkeley, Calif.
   The government has won the first legal skirmishes, most recently
a ruling by a federal judge in Atlanta that CDC experts can't be

   The court Monday refused to disturb Pentagon policy, which says
``homosexuality is incompatible with military service.''
   The court rejected appeals by Miriam Ben-Shalom, denied

   His announcement Monday that he will not run for mayor of the

presidential campaign gets rolling, Jackson will make his third bid
for the White House.
   ``I want to continue to serve, but not as mayor,'' Jackson told

the troubled Marion Barry as mayor of the District of Columbia, a

   Serve as what, was the next natural question.

   Church leaders are urging increased

1990 the International Year of Bible Reading.
   The Rev. Harold C. Bennett, head of the Southern Baptist

   ``The Bible is God's word of love, hope, direction and
fulfillment in a world of hate, despair, confusion and
dissatisfaction. That message from the Lord is needed now, more
than ever.''
   Bush proclaimed the year after a joint Senate-House resolution
declared the ``history of our nation clearly illustrates the value
of voluntarily applying the teachings of the Bible in the lives of
individuals and families.''
   The resolution says: ``The Bible has made a unique contribution
in shaping the United States as a distinctive and blessed nation
and people. Deeply held convictions springing from the Bible led to
the early settlement of our nation.''

<HEAD>``Jesus'' Appears On Television Commercial To Boost Church
Attendance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KRISTI UMBREIT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An actor portrays Jesus in an unusual
paid television commercial here seeking to boost attendance at an
inner-city United Methodist church.
   The pastor, the Rev. Craig A. Hunter, decided something more was
needed than the typical ``come visit us'' appeals used by churches
in such efforts.
   With the help of a local advertising firm, he put together two
30-second spots using an actor portraying Jesus Christ.
   In one spot, ``Jesus'' is sitting silently and alone in a pew.
In the other, he is being led through a church door by a young girl.
   ``To our knowledge, this is the first church in the nation that
has ever used an actor to portray Jesus in a television
commercial,'' said Hunter, senior pastor of Richard Brown Memorial
United Methodist Church.
   The commercials, which state, ``There's a very special spirit in
this church,'' and that it has ``a few seats left, and one of them
is for you,'' began airing in mid-February on TV stations in this
city of about 110,000 people.
   Hunter said it's too soon to gauge the sentiments of the public
and other churches. But he's braced for criticism.
   Armed with a $6,000 grant from the East Ohio Conference of the
United Methodist Church, Hunter visited local market and media
specialist Vic Rubenstein, who offered his services for free and
persuaded an area production crew and Ohio actor John Galgosi to
make the commercial at cost.
   One Sunday last month Hunter cut short the church service, and
crews wheeled in a fog machine, lights, movie camera and other
equipment. They filmed two commercials in about four hours.
   One begins with the sound of a heartbeat and features a young
man nodding off in a pew. He is the only person in the church,
which appears misty.
   As the camera closes in on the man, a voice-over says, ``Some
churches are kind of empty. Others are kind of staid. Others are
very sleepy.''
   He awakes and his image fades, then becomes the likeness of
Jesus, with a small halo around his head. The camera pulls back and
he is surrounded by congregation members.
   In the other commercial, a narrator portrays a visitor, speaking
to his wife as he walks around inside the church.
   ``This is some special church, Martha,'' the man says as the
camera scans people in classes and other activities. The man notes
the different races and backgrounds of members and says, ``There is
something special going here.''
   Just then, a little girl walks through the door holding the hand
of Jesus, who scans the activities and smiles slightly and
approvingly.
   The character of Jesus, played by Galgosi, 37, does not speak in
either commercial. Galgosi, a dark-complexioned Caucasian with
brown eyes and long, brown curly hair, wears a robe in the spots.
   The church bought some of the local commercial time; other spots
are given free by stations as public service announcements,
Rubenstein said. The church qualifies because it is non-profit, he
said.
   ``The first rule of marketing is one of positioning, of
separating your product and your service from the rest,'' said
Rubenstein, who attends a synagogue across the street from Hunter's
church.
   Rubenstein said the Richard Brown church seemed special to him
because of its mix of people.
   ``You see the blacks and the whites, the wealthy, the poor, the
very secure, ... intellectual, university group, ... the
handicapped. Who else but a spirit could bring these kinds of
people together?''
   The church's stone structure, built in 1915, is near the
Youngstown State University campus. Hunter said membership reached
about 500 in the 1950s, but residents' migration to the suburbs has
cut the congregation to about 200.
   Hunter and Rubenstein said most of the calls they have received
since the ads ran have been positive.
   ``I warned Craig. I said, believe me, be prepared for the
flak,'' Rubenstein said. ``I don't think we've really experienced
that backlash yet.''
   Richard L. Rustad, pastor of Boardman United Methodist Church,
one of the city's larger Methodist churches, said he saw no
problems with the commercials.
   ``We believe, speaking as a person in a mainline church, not
only in historical Jesus but in the present Christ, and it seems
like they're trying to indicate that the person and presence of
Christ can be found within that congregation,'' Rustad said. ``In
fact it's creative. It's good.
   ``It's a very interesting church over there because it's very
heterogeneous,'' he said of the Richard Brown congregation. ``I
think if Christ were to come back, that may be the very kind of
place you'd find him.''

   If you harbor any doubts that life is a
business, stop and consider the record-keeping work that the
government requires of the 100 million-plus people who pay U.S.
income taxes.
   The assignment starts with, but is by no means limited to,
filing a tax return on time each year. The rules also require you
to be ready to support that return with documents on just about any
question that the Internal Revenue Service might raise.
   So even people who farm out their tax affairs to paid advisers
often find themselves with boxes or file drawers full of records
that threaten to overflow.
   At this time of year, especially, the issue tends to arise: How
long must one hang onto all those canceled checks from some year in
the administration of President Ford? Is there any simple system to
use in determining when to throw old tax records away?
   The short answers to those questions, in order, are ``It
depends'' and ``Probably not.'' But cumbersome as the process of
tax record-keeping may be, experts on the subject say it need not
be totally unmanageable.
   The basic rule of thumb is that all documents related to tax
matters should be kept for a minimum of three years after the date
on which a return is filed or due (whichever comes later).
   That is the standard period in which the government has a legal
right to take action on your return.
   The limitation period stretches to six years in cases where it
is determined that a taxpayer failed to report income amounting to
25 percent or more of the total listed on any year's return.
   ``As a matter of course we recommend that you keep all your
canceled checks for six years,'' says the accounting firm of Ernst
&amp; Young in this year's edition of its Arthur Young Tax Guide.
   Before you toss your pile of 1979 records in the trash bin,
furthermore, advisers suggest that you give some thought to a few
other eventualities.
   For one thing, in cases of fraud or failure to file any return,
the statute of limitations may extend indefinitely.
   Additionally, you might give the documents a quick review before
pitching them to see if they contain any information of lasting
relevance.
   That applies in particular to anything that might affect the
cost basis of property you own that you might one day sell at a
capital gain subject to tax.
   Suppose you installed new kitchen cabinets in your home in 1979.
Proof of expenses for such lasting improvements can lower the tax
you might owe when the time comes to sell the house.
   Or to put it the other way around, an absence of such proof
might well mean that you have to pay far more in taxes when you
sell than the law would otherwise have required.
   For a variety of purposes, tax specialists generally agree that
you should keep copies of your yearly tax returns indefinitely.
   KMPG Peat Warwick, accountants, suggest another reason to curb
any instinct you feel to get rid of tax records as soon as possible:
   ``Occasionally, new tax legislation that benefits the individual
is made effective retroactively. This may provide the opportunity
to file an amended tax return and collect a refund _ but only if
you have the appropriate records.''

<HEAD>Soviet Doctor Treating America's Down and Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS GEORGATOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's no couch in psychiatrist Lia Dobraya's
office at the Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center, just a
couple of straight-backed chairs, a metal desk and some file
cabinets.
   But the doctor who spent the first 27 years of her career in the
Soviet Union calls the office her palace, and to the downtrodden
who come through the door to try to beat drug or alcohol addiction,
it's a trip toward sobriety.
   ``The happiest moment, really, of my life in America was when
the Salvation Army hired me,'' said Dobraya, a therapist at the
126-bed center the past year.
   Dobraya is one of 11 clinical staffers at the Salvation Army's
largest drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in the country.
   ``This was something she wanted to do. She came to us,'' said
the center's administrator, Maj. Robert Bodine. ``One of her first
thoughts when she came to the United States was to somehow be
involved with the Salvation Army in terms of reflecting her own
values in wanting to be involved with people and to help them.''
   The Christian-oriented charitable agency wraps the spiritual
approach into the educational and clinical aspects of treating _ at
no charge _ alcoholics and drug addicts.
   ``Dr. Dobraya had a great deal of experience in treating
alcoholism and drug addiction in the Soviet Union,'' said Dr.
Edward Lataille, the center's director of clinical services. ``A
lot of that skill is transferrable here.''
   With her background and experience of oppression, ``she's able
to understand, perhaps, some of the pain and hardships'' that many
of the center's patients have experienced, he said.
   Some 450 people a year go through the center's six-month
residential treatment program, about 40 percent of whom overcome
their addiction, Lataille said.
   The patients' average age is 34 and they cross the social
spectrum. The one thing they have in common is that alcohol or
drugs have shattered their lives, often to the point where they're
living on the street.
   ``Many of our people have been so devastated by the disease of
alcoholism or drug addiction that they've lost medical insurance,
they've lost family and don't have money or insurance to pay for
treatment. So, we're treating a population that would otherwise not
be treated,'' Lataille said.
   A graduate of Odessa's Medical Institute, Dobraya went into
psychiatry after an internship at a mental hospital exposed her to
the sadness of mental disease and chemical dependency.
   ``I thought, `I must help them,''' she said.
   And though failures often outnumber successful treatments, the
success stories make the job worthwhile.
   ``It's hard, but it's a big happiness when you can see you can
help these people,'' said Dobraya.
   Like the United States, the Soviet Union has severe problems
with substance abuse. She described alcoholism as the Soviet
Union's No. 1 health problem and drug abuse, once dismissed as a
capitalistic phenomenon, as an emerging social problem.
   Because religion was frowned upon in the Soviet Union, doctors
were forbidden from introducing it as a theraputic tool for
recovering susbstance abusers.
   Rather, Dobraya said, techniques including hypnosis, group and
individual psychotherapy and medications were emphasized in the
Soviet Union. But she estimated that more than 80 percent of the
Soviets treated for alcoholism return to drinking.
   Now, Dobraya, 51, is free to ``appeal to the souls of our
clients'' as a way to help them toward sobriety.
   ``The people in the program are happy and from a psychiatric
point of view, I know it works for them more than any education or
medication,'' she said.
   In the Soviet Union, before recent reforms allowing more
religious freedom, ``there was no possibility to even think about a
Christian approach or spiritual approach,'' she said.
   ``Even if I could have used that approach, many could not
understand it because they grew up without religion. They believed
in a false religion. This false religion was created on blood, the
blood of millions of people.''
   Philosophical differences with the Soviet state and the way its
secret police manipulated psychiatry in the past to suppress
dissent also motivated her November 1988 emigration to the United
States.
   She was allowed to leave with her husband, Vladimir, a
48-year-old software engineer, when emigration policies were
loosened. Their two adult sons, a daughter-in-law and a
granddaughter stayed behind, although Dobraya hopes to one day be
reunited with them in America.
   ``I like and appreciate this country and its people, who are
very kind and good and calm,'' she said. ``There are not so many
irritated people, even among our clients who have emotional
problems. The Soviet people are kind of survivors. They are, it
seems, almost in a permanent state of tension.''

executive committee, said: ``The Bible is God's word of love, hope,
direction and fulfillment in a world of hate, despair, confusion
and dissatisfaction. That message from the Lord is needed now, more
than ever.''
   Bush proclaimed the year after a joint Senate-House resolution
declared the ``history of our nation clearly illustrates the value
of voluntarily applying the teachings of the Bible in the lives of
individuals and families.''
   The resolution says: ``The Bible has made a unique contribution
in shaping the United States as a distinctive and blessed nation
and people. Deeply held convictions springing from the Bible led to
the early settlement of our nation.''

<HEAD>The 1990 Census: What Will it Find?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``So, tell me about yourself,'' the Census
Bureau is about to ask Americans, a bit like an eager young man in
a singles bar.
   Both suitor and statistician think they already know some of the
answers. But, inevitably, both will hear things they didn't expect.
   ``There were some surprises in 1980 and we also expect some
surprises in 1990,'' says William P. Butz, associate director of
the Census Bureau.
   ``There are things we think are happening but, come the '90
census, we'll find that some of that is wrong,'' Butz acknowledges.
   What surprises are likely?
   With Census Day set for April 1, and months of effort to follow
in compiling and analyzing the numbers, Butz says simply, ``I don't
know yet.''
   While the Census Bureau takes a national head count only once
every 10 years, it is constantly taking sample surveys and has a
pretty good idea of what's going on with the nation's
quarter-billion people.
   The 1990 census will find not only a bigger population than in
1980, but one that is different in many ways. Americans are older,
live in different places, have a larger ethnic component and have
changed socially and economically in the last decade.
   Anticipating what the April count will find, here's a look at
the Census Bureau's most recent estimates:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>HOW MANY</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. population was estimated at 249.6 million as of Jan. 1
and should be close to 250 million by April 1, up from 226.5
million in 1980.
   The first census, in 1790, counted 3.9 million people. That's
just slightly more than now live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>WHO</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hispanics now make a big dent in America's consciousness, having
increased to more than 20 million people as they flooded into the
country in recent years.
   Hispanics now account for 8.4 percent of the population, up from
6.4 percent in the 1980 census.
   That means Hispanics are growing faster than the general
population.
   ``Immigration accounted for about half of the overall gain,''
said Carmen DeNavas of the Census Bureau. ``Since 1982 the Central
and South American population here has grown 67 percent.''
   The location and characteristics of immigrants will be of
interest this time, Butz said.
   In 1980 the bureau was surprised at the lack of education among
Haitian immigrants, for example, and it located some unexpected
pockets of new arrivals.
   The nation's racial breakdown also is changing.
   In 1980, 85.9 percent of Americans were white, 11.7 percent were
black and 2.3 percent were Asian or members of other races.
Estimates for 1990 anticipate the white share will be down to 84.2
percent, with blacks up to 12.4 percent and Asians and others
rising to 3.4 percent.
   The 1980s appear to be the first decade in at least 100 years
when more blacks moved to the South than left it, and the census
hopes to learn more about that trend, Butz said.
   Getting an accurate county of minorities is an important effort
this time, since studies of the 1980 census concluded blacks were
missed more often than whites.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>FAMILIES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Families including a married couple account for just 56 percent
of all households, down from 61 percent in 1980 and 70 percent in
1970, reflecting the growth in single people and one-parent
families.
   Family size also has been declining as people have fewer
children. In 1980 there were 79 youths aged 18 and under for every
100 families. By 1989 that was down to 69.
   The 1990 count may find the decline in childbearing is easing,
however, as women who put off having families to complete schooling
and start careers decide to have children.
   ``We are seeing significant changes in the number of women in
their 30s having children. Women are postponing their first births
and opting for more education and more time in the labor force,''
says Amara Bachu, a Census Bureau statistician.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>STEPCHILDREN</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The growth of single-parent families stemming from divorce also
has allowed for more remarriages. Hence, the number of stepchildren
grew to 6.8 million by 1985, up 15 percent from 1980. It it
expected to prove even higher in 1990.
   Historically there have been far fewer children in one-parent
homes, with more of those children in homes headed by a widowed,
rather than divorced, parent, says Arlene Saluter of the Census
Bureau.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>WIVES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wives' earnings were increasing at twice the rate of husbands'
in the 1980s. But wives still earn half of what their husbands
bring home.
   From 1980 to 1987, wives' earnings rose 23 percent, compared to
a 12 percent growth for their husbands. But wives still averaged
$13,250, compared to $29,150 for their husbands.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>WHERE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's center of population is continuing it's trek south
and west. The mythical point where the nation could balance if
everyone weighed the same crossed the Mississippi River in 1980,
winding up in Missouri.
   Since then the Sun Belt states have continued to lead the nation
in growth. In the 1980s, California added 4 million people, the
most of any state. Indeed, California, Texas and Florida accounted
for half the national growth in the decade.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>HOW OLD</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation continues to age as the giant post-World War II baby
boom generation matures.
   The median age of the United States hit 30 in 1980, grew to 32.1
by 1987 and will be even higher when the 1990 count is complete.
Median means that half of all Americans are older than that age and
half younger.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CITIES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In addition to moving to the South and the West, Americans have
been concentrating growth in metropolitan areas in the 1980s, in
contrast to the 1970s, when rural areas experienced a boom.
   The result has been city growth in the Sun Belt, with places
such as San Diego, Jacksonville, Fla., and San Jose, Calif., moving
up the list of biggest cities.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>EDUCATION</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are better educated than ever before, thanks largely
to the educational efforts of the baby boom generation.
   The 1990 census is expected to show 77.7 percent of men and 76.9
percent of women aged 25 and over have completed high school and
21.9 percent of men and 15.6 percent of women are college
graduates, American Demographics magazine says.
   By contrast, in 1980, 67.7 percent of men were high school grads
and 20.3 percent had finished college. For women, the 66.2 percent
had finished high school and 12.9 percent held college degrees.
   But those gains may not continue.
   ``Men aged 25 to 34 are now less likely to have completed
college than were the baby boomers ten years ago. The high cost of
education may be pushing young adults out of college and into the
workforce,'' say researchers Judith Waldrop and Thomas Exter.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>HOMELESS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990 census will count people ``in shelters, on the streets
and in halfway houses,'' says the bureau's Peter Bounpane. With
estimates of the number of homeless ranging from 300,000 to 2
million, the bureau hopes to prodice a reasonably accurate estimate
of these people for the first time.

   The importers of Evian bottled water are
launching a new advertising campaign this week even as the importer
of a rival bottled water, Perrier, announced its drink may be back
in circulation within two months.
   Evian importers point out that their new advertising has been in
development since June and that timing of the campaign was decided
long before Source Perrier SA recalled bottles of its flagship
brand earlier this month.
   The new Evian ads make no reference at all to the the Perrier
recall, which followed the discovery that some Perrier bottles were
contaminated with traces of a toxic chemical, benzene.
   ``We are not trying to capitalize on the Perrier recall,'' said
Maryanne Farrell, senior marketing manager for Evian Waters of
France Inc., based in Greenwich, Conn. ``It's unfortunate for
Perrier that it happened.'
   But timing of the Evian campaign is opportune nonetheless.
   Grocers and restuarant owners have had to scramble to find
replacements for Perrier, the third best-selling bottled water in
the U.S., since its Feb. 9 recall here.
   Orders for LaCroix Sparkling Water have quadrupled, according to
LaCroix Water Co., based in La Crosse, Wis. The company says it
boosted production by 50 percent to 60 percent a day to meet demand.
   Saratoga Springs Mineral Water Co. in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.,
another Evian company, has noted a marked increase in sales of its
Saratoga natural sparkling water since Perrier was recalled on Feb.
9 in the United States.
   ``They have sold in a week's time what they normally sell in a
month,'' she said. The production day has been lengthened 50
percent to meet demand.
   And Canadian Shield Spring Water Co., based in Sault Ste. Marie,
Ontario, Canada, said the recall has meant more demand for its
Canadian Spring Premium Sparkling Water even as the company was
expanding distribution nationally after test marketing it in the
Upper Midwest and Northeast for the past 2{ years.
   ``We have had to put new distributors on hold'' while meeting
increased demand from current distributors, said spokeswoman Helen
Gillespie.
   Perrier, which insists it acted responsibly in ordering the
worldwide recall, said Monday in Paris that its recall was nearly
complete.
   Its U.S. arm, Perrier Group of America Inc., said new safeguards
are being put in place and it was expected the Perrier brand ``will
be on the shelves within six to eight weeks.''
   Evian sales figures since the recall are not yet available, said
Evian's Ms. Farrell. And she noted that non-carbonated Evian is not
directly comparable to the bubbly Perrier, which is often used on
social occasions.
   The company refused to comment on spending plans, but trade
reports indicate Evian plans to spend about $6 million on its ad
campaign in 1990, up about 50 percent from last year.
   The campaign includes commercials that debuted Monday on
television stations in New York and Los Angeles and will be run
next month in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Miami, Philadelphia
and San Diego.
   The ads, shot in Hawaii and Yosemite National Park in
California, show mountains, lakes and trees and active people
basking in the natural beauty and drinking Evian, which is
described as ``nature's gift.''
   In one commercial, the viewer sees the dawn breaking through a
wooded area where a man runs, a woman stretches her leg muscles and
a bicyclist rides.
   ``Morning ... 365 chances a year to do something healthy,'' a
narrator says. Like morning, the narrator adds, Evian is ``always
there for you to do something healthy.''
   Evian also is running a print ad in eight major newspapers that
runs an unusually long 2,500 words and is called ``Just a Drop of
What You Should Know About Water'' in which it tells consumers why
their bodies need water.
   Hellen Berry, market research director at Beverage Marketing
Corp. in New York, said local or regional brands are benefitting
from Perrier's absence.
   But Perrier Group is filling the void as well with its own
domestic sparkling water brands.
   Spokeswoman Jane Lazgin said Perrier is able to offer store
owners replacements such as Poland Spring in the Northeast,
Calistoga and Arrowhead in California and Ozarka in Texas.
   ``We have had real sound business relationships with these
retailers for 10-12 years and we are retaining much of our space,''
Ms. Lazgin said.

<HEAD>Trump Shuttle Pilots Ratify New Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pilots at Trump Shuttle, the northeast airline
service named after the billionaire developer who bought it last
June, have ratified a new contract agreement.
   The four-year contract was approved by the pilots over the
weekend and announced by the airline Monday. It provides for wage
increases averaging 10 percent this year and a total 15 percent
over the next three years.
   The contract also makes changes in work rules to allow greater
scheduling flexibility and calls for the pilots to begin sharing
increased costs of medical benefits in 1991.
   Nearly all the 227 pilots at Trump Shuttle, which links New York
with Boston and Washington, formerly worked for Eastern Airlines.
Real estate tycoon Donald Trump bought the shuttle service from
Miami-based Eastern for $365 million.
   Ray Grebey, the shuttle's chief labor negotiator, said in a
statement that the new agreement reflects ``the unique nature of
hourly shuttle operations.''
   The wage hike for this year, which depends on a pilot's rank and
averages 10 percent, was effective Feb. 19, Trump Shuttle
spokeswoman Joan Fudala said.
   She said the changes in work rules will allow standby shuttle
crews, for example, to be assigned to fly charter flights when
passenger traffic doesn't require additional shuttle flights.
   The new contract also replaces a two-tiered wage structure for
pilots with a single tier, Ms. Fudala said. Starting pay for all
new pilots will be $26,400 a year.
   The contract calls for a retroactive 8 percent wage increase for
July 18, 1989, through Jan. 1, 1990, for all pilots who formerly
worked for Eastern. The wage hike reflects the result of
arbitration between Eastern management and the pilots.
   Trump Shuttle pilots belong to the Air Line Pilots Association,
one of three unions that struck Eastern last March, pushing it into
bankruptcy court reorganization. Eastern pilots and flight
attendants halted their sympathy strikes last November, but the
Machinists union is continuing its walkout.
   Contract negotiations covering the 280 flight attendants at
Trump Shuttle are due to start around April 1, Ms. Fudala said.
Talks with Machinists have been postponed pending a challenge from
a rival group, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, which
is seeking to represent mechanics at Trump Shuttle.

of its global manufacturing strategy.
   Chairman Donald Petersen sat at the wheel and his designated
successor, Vice Chairman Harold ``Red'' Poling, rode alongside as
the nation's No. 2 automaker on Monday rolled the first production
model of its 1991 Escort, a bright red two-door, off the line at
its Wayne assembly plant.
   The car, Poling said, ``is a sign of Ford's commitment to
building small cars here in the United States.''
   With the closing earlier this month of No. 3 Chrysler Corp.'s
Jefferson Avenue assembly plant in Detroit, Ford became the only
one of the Big Three that makes subcompacts in the United States.
Sales leader General Motors Corp. gets its small cars, mostly
grouped under the Geo nameplate, from Japanese makers or joint
ventures in the United States and Canada.
   Nevertheless, Ford's new subcompact relies heavily on Japanese
know-how. Mazda Motor Corp., which is 25-percent owned by Ford,
designed the car and has helped Ford gear up its Escort plant using
Japanese production techniques and equipment.
   Monday's ceremony took place in the newly renovated Wayne
Assembly Plant. It's loaded with Japanese influences ranging from
the obvious _ huge Komatsu stamping presses _ to the not-so-obvious
_ a method of manufacturing strikingly similar to that used at
Mazda's assembly plant in Flat Rock, south of Detroit.
   Petersen and Poling, who will take over as chairman when
Petersen retires Thursday after more than 40 years with the
company, said the Escort project shows how Ford is integrating its
worldwide manufacturing business in Asia, Europe and North America.
   Ford is investing $2 billion into the project, code-named CT-20,
which also involves production of the Mercury Tracer at the
company's plant in Hermosillo, Mexico.
   Part of the project involves the 900 or so Wayne stamping and
body assembly employees who work under what's called a modern
operating agreement _ a manufacturing method using small teams of
workers with the ability to perform several tasks.
   It is Ford's only such agreement in operation. GM and Chrysler
have similar programs at a variety of their operations.
   The Ford agreement was patterned after programs at Japanese
plants, including Mazda's Flat Rock factory, which makes the Ford
Probe.
   As at Mazda's only U.S. assembly plant, workers at Ford's Wayne
stamping plant wear identical uniforms and coordinate their jobs
through the use of teams.
   Automakers said the concept improves contact between management
and employees and helps productivity by encouraging employees to
suggest how a job can be performed better.
   ``Perhaps this will be a new way of doing business,'' said Kevin
McGuinness, an industrial engineer who now works in the new
stamping operation linked to the main assembly plant.
   The United Auto Workers union has said there is a danger in the
team concept eroding the traditional labor-management relationship.
   Although Poling said the Escort itself would be unprofitable,
Ford is pinning a lot on the subcompact.
   The company needs the vehicle to help it meet government fuel
economy standards, which sets average mileage standards that each
automaker's fleet must meet. The more Escorts it sells, the more
low-mileage, high-profit mid-and full-size cars Ford can sell
without incurring any government penalties.

<HEAD>Simmons Begins Proxy Fight for Lockheed, Hires Salomon Bros.,

   Dallas billionaire Harold C. Simmons is
soliciting shareholder votes to oust Lockheed Corp.'s board of
directors and has hired consultants on both coasts to help.
   In a filing with federal regulators Monday, Simmons disclosed
that he also wants to eliminate Lockheed's shareholders rights
plan, also known as a poison pill defense.
   That rights plan would make it prohibitively expensive for
anyone to buy more than 20 percent of the company's common stock.
Simmons has an 18.9 percent stake.
   The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission also
disclosed that NL Industries has hired New York investment bankers
Salomon Brothers Inc. as a proxy solicitor and Jefferies &amp; Company
Inc., a Los Angeles-based firm, as a consultant in the proxy battle.
   NL agreed to pay Salomon $150,000 per month and Jefferies
$100,000 per month. In addition, the filing disclosed that it would
retain Salomon as a financial adviser and investment banker for a
year if the proxy fight succeeds. Toward that end, NL paid Salomon
$750,000 up front and agreed to pay mutually agreed upon fees
``from time to time.''
   A letter to Lockheed included in the SEC filing blasted the
California-based defense contractor for reportedly announcing the
date of its annual meeting at a time designed to hamper NL
Industries Inc.'s bid to unseat the board.
   Under company by-laws, shareholders have 10 days from the public
announcement of the meeting's date to submit proxy statements for
consideration at the meeting.
   NL Industries, a Houston chemicals concern controlled by
Simmons, said Lockheed announced the March 29 meeting shortly after
6 p.m. on Feb. 16.
   ``By announcing the shareholders meeting after the close of
business on a Friday preceding a three-day holiday weekend,
Lockheed's management effectively gave NL just five business days
to prepare its nomination materials,'' NL Industries President J.
Landis Martin wrote Lockheed.
   ``We hope that management's conduct in connection with the
announcement of the annual meeting does not mean that we are in for
five weeks of manipulation of Lockheed's corporate machinery,''
Martin added.
   A Lockheed spokesman, Ron Meder, said the company had no comment
on Martin's allegations.
   Simmons, of Dallas, revealed his 15 board nominees last
Thursday. They include himself, Martin, former Sen. John G. Tower,
a Texas Republican, and Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., a retired admiral and
former chief of naval operations.
   All the nominees on Simmons' slate _ with the exception of
himself, Martin and Michael Snetzer, president of Valhi Inc.,
another Simmons controlled company _ will be paid $20,000 apiece if
they are not elected, according to the filing.
   Simmons decided to launch a proxy fight after Lockheed Chairman
Daniel M. Tellep rebuffed his request for board representation.

<HEAD>Honda Won't Enter East Europe _ For Now</HEAD>

   Honda Motor Co.'s chief executive officer says
the automaker has no immediate plans to make vehicles in the
emerging Eastern European market, although it is preparing to sell
a U.S.-made station wagon in Europe.
   ``We are fully aware that major changes are taking place.
Unfortunately, however, we are not very well versed in situations
in Eastern Europe,'' Tadashi Kume said Monday. He was in Detroit to
accept an award from Automotive Industries magazine.
   Honda spokesman Shin Tanaka said, ``It's too early to make a
judgment.''
   Other automakers, including General Motors Corp. and Suzuki
Motor Co., already have signed deals to bring manufacturing into
Eastern Europe and other companies are considering moves into the
region.
   Honda is preparing to begin exporting to Europe a U.S.-made
Accord station wagon, Kume said.
   ``Perhaps in the not-too-distant future the Accord wagon would
be produced at the Ohio plant and would be the first car we would
be shipping from the United States to Europe,'' said Kume.
   There is debate about whether U.S.-made Hondas should be
classified as Japanese or U.S. vehicles as five of the 12 European
Community nations have stiff barriers on importing Japanese cars.
   France and Italy are pushing for EC-wide quotas to restrict all
Japanese cars regardless of where the vehicles are built. But Kume
said he doesn't expect Honda to run into problems.
   ``We would hope they end up with a very amicable conclusion,''
he said.
   Honda will begin making the Accord wagon at its assembly plant
in Marysville, Ohio, later this year for the 1991 model year.
Honda's Marysville plant now makes its Civic and Accord models.
   The Honda Accord was the best-selling car in the United States
last year, the first time a car with a Japanese company's nameplate
topped the best-seller list. Honda sold 362,707 of the cars in
1989, topping the Ford Taurus at 348,061.
   Late last year, Honda began Civic production at a new plant in
East Liberty, Ohio, making Honda the only Japan-based company with
two assembly plants in the United States.
   By 1992, Honda will more than double its production at the East
Liberty plant to 150,000 cars a year, while production of about
360,000 cars a year will continue at Marysville, said Honda
spokesman Aki Kato.
   Of those, about 50,000 cars will be shipped to Japan from the
United States. Other cars, including the Accord wagon, will be
shipped across the Atlantic.

<HEAD>American Express To Inject $750 Million Into Shearson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market's increasingly bearish attitude
toward securities brokers appears to have forced American Express
Co. to drop plans to reduce its stake in Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., the nation's No. 2 brokerage.
   American Express said Monday it will inject $750 million into
its Shearson and increase its ownership of the troubled Wall Street
house by purchasing new Shearson stock.
   The move would appear to be a significant setback for American
Express. The financial services company had been trying for months
to reduce its stake in Shearson to below 50 percent so it could
remove the troubled broker from its balance sheet and reduce its
exposure to the sharp profits swings of Wall Street.
   ``It sounds like American Express is going to take over Shearson
lock, stock and barrel,'' said Perrin Long, a brokerage industry
analyst for Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.
   The new plan will boost American Express' stake in Shearson by
an undetermined amount, said American Express spokesman Matt Stover.
   It replaces a previous plan to shore up Shearson's finances that
would have reduced American Express' stake in the broker to about
45 percent from 61 percent currently.
   Under the abandoned plan, Shearson would have sold $250 million
worth of stock to its existing shareholders. American Express had
planned to distribute its quota of Shearson shares to American
Express shareholders.
   The Shearson share offering was dropped ``in light of unsettled
conditions affecting the securities industry,'' American Express
said in a statement.
   In addition to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by the parent of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., profits at many Wall Street firms have
been pressured by a drop in merger activity and securities
underwriting and sluggish stock and bond trading since the October
1987 crash.
   Just last week, First Boston Corp. issued statements denying
that it was under pressure because of loans to troubled buyout
companies. And last month, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. reported a $213
million loss for 1989 after taking a heft $470 million charge to
cover layoffs and cost-cutting.
   Asked whether the new plan represented a change of heart, Stover
said American Express always had a commitment to Shearson.
   ``What we are doing with our action today is making a very
clear, unequivocal, strong statement of our support of Shearson for
the long term,'' he said.
   ``This is an industry where client confidence is of utmost
importance,'' he added. ``There are times that you need to send a
stronger signal.''
   Long said the brokerage's earnings volatility still makes it
unattractive to American Express in the long run.
   ``The longer-term strategy at American Express is to get
Shearson into much better operating condition and then one way or
the other get themselves out of Shearson altogether,'' he said.
   The latest move by American Express represents the second major
change in a month in its plan to bail out Shearson, which has been
under pressure to raise its capital levels.
   Late last month, Shearson scrapped a plan to sell stock to the
public to raise cash after its stock price declined sharply.
   That move came in the wake of the sudden resignation under
pressure of Shearson's chairman, Peter A. Cohen.
   Shearson needs capital because of the threat of a ratings
downgrade by credit-rating agencies.
   Last fall, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it was
considering downgrading Shearson's rating because of the firm's low
capital level, weak profits and exposure to commercial real estate
loans and investments, as well as the overall securities industry
slump.
   Like other securities firms, Shearson finances much of its
activity with borrowed money. A ratings downgrade would raise its
costs by forcing it to pay greater interest on its borrowings.
   Under the new plan, American Express will buy a combination of
common and preferred Shearson stock worth $750 million. The common
stock will be bought at $11 a share.
   Shearson stock closed unchanged Monday at $10.87{ a share in New
York Stock Exchange trading. American Express disclosed its plans
after the stock market closed.
   Analysts say much of Shearson's trouble stems from overexpansion
during Cohen's reign. Shearson grew from a medium-sized retail
outfit to a diversified brokerage by acquiring investment banking
firm Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb in 1984 and retail brokerage E.F.
Hutton &amp; Co. in 1988.
   Cohen was replaced by Howard L. Clark Jr., chief financial
officer and executive vice president of American Express. Clark's
father was American Express chairman before current Chairman James
D. Robinson.
   Analysts interpreted Clark's appointment as a sign that American
Express wanted to run the troubled brokerage directly. The new
recapitalization plan appears to be another move in that direction.

   While prices have plunged on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange in recent days, traders and the government have been
playing a waiting game on the key question of interest rates.
   Many analysts believe the government must raise rates to cool
the inflationary fears that many believe are underlying the
market's jitters. But a rate increase could unsettle the market
further because higher rates make stocks less attractive.
   ``Uncertainty hurts the market. An interest rate increase will
hurt the market. The question is which will hurt more,'' said
Robert Alan Feldman, an economist for Salomon Brothers' Asian
subsidiary.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange suffered its second-worst daily drop
ever on Monday, with the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average falling 4.5
percent. The key market index has dropped about 14 percent since
reaching record highs at the end of 1989.
   The index rallied 1.7 percent today after swinging sharply
during the session.
   Many analysts and dealers are convinced that the Bank of Japan's
only option to help settle the market is to raise interest rates.
   For weeks, market speculation has been that Japan's central bank
would raise its discount rate, the interest it charges for loans to
commercial banks.
   Analysts say such a move is needed to curb inflation, which has
been heralded by a rapidly increasing money supply and a severe
labor shortage, and to cool high stock and land prices that many
see as signs of economic overheating.
   Expectations were that the move would follow the Feb. 18
parliamentary elections. It didn't, and analysts attributed the
major stock market slide that began the next day to uncertainties
over interest rates.
   In an interview Monday, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno
reiterated the bank's cautious stance on another increase in the
discount rate, which was raised three times last year.
   ``Now we have to see how these rising interest rates (from last
year) will affect the economy. We hope for a favorable result, but
if we find that the measures we have taken so far are not enough,
then we will have to move into the next step,'' he said.
   ``We are also listening to the views, which we hear in the
markets, that if we raised the rate again at a time when stock
prices are declining so sharply, it would push the market further
down,'' he said.
   Feldman and others who urge an interest rate hike acknowledge
that such a move might not immediately stop the fall on Tokyo's
stock market. Interest rate increases tend to lower demand for
stock shares because of the prospect that higher borrowing costs
will hamper corporate earnings.
   But, Feldman contended, an interest rate boost would stabilize
the Japanese yen, and ``will be a basis for calming down.''
   Many analysts believe a ``vicious cycle'' of ``cheap yen, cheap
stocks and cheap bonds'' is behind the turmoil in the Tokyo markets.
   ``The decline of each one has accelerated the decline of the
other two,'' said Johsen Takahashi, director of Mitsubishi Research
Institute Inc.
   If an interest rate increase strengthens the yen, these analysts
say, that ultimately will break the cycle. The weakening Japanese
currency has declined by 4.13 yen against the U.S. dollar in the
last five trading days. The dollar closed Monday at 148.65 yen.
   ``As long as they (Bank of Japan) are waiting to help maintain
the pursestrings of the Ministry of Finance, they'll screw up the
rest of us,'' said Doug Schumway, a trader for Jardine Fleming
Securities.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange bounced
back moderately Tuesday, one day after the market's main index
suffered its second-worst plunge ever, while the dollar rose
slightly.
   The dollar closed at 149.03 yen, up 0.38 yen. After opening at
148.30 yen, the currency ranged between 148.10-149.50 yen. The
dollar has gained 4.56 yen in the last six trading days.
   The dollar remained relatively firm against the yen despite the
Bank of Japan's intermittent dollar-selling intervention to prop up
the declining yen by selling dollars, traders said. The
intervention amounted to some $2 billion, the Japan Broadcasting
Corp. said.
   The yen remained weak and the demand for dollars strong since
Japan's economic fundamentals have remained constant, said Bank of
Tokyo trader Masato Hayashi.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues recouped 576.08
points, or 1.73 percent, closing at 33,897.95.
   On Monday, the index fell 1,569.10 points, or 4.5 percent, to
close at 33,321.87. The loss was second only to the 3,836.48 plunge
of Oct. 20, 1987, after Wall Street's ``Black Monday.'' That fall
of 14.9 percent, however, was less than New York's Black Monday
plunge of 22.6 percent.
   While the yen remained weak, demand for dollars is strong, said
Hayashi.
   On Monday, the dollar rose 2.18 yen, closing at 148.65 yen. The
dollar has gained 4.13 yen the last five trading days.
   Dealers initially attributed the Nikkei's recovery to market
players' optimistic prospects that the index had hit bottom, as
well as an overnight rise of 38 points in New York's Dow Jones
industrial average.
   ``Market players are still a little bit cautious, but they
started picking up issues that had fallen, and I think the plunge
more or less stopped, at least just for now,'' said Masahiro
Umemori, an analyst with Nomura Securities, Co.
   He said the market's initial recovery was in part encouraged by
investors expectations that the Bank of Japan would not raise its
official discount rate.
   It is considered unwise for the central bank to raise its
discount rate when the stock market has been deteriorating,
analysts said.
   Higher interest rates discourage stock investment.
   On the currency market, the dollar was slightly lower following
its slip on overseas markets, traders said.
   Meanwhile, the Tokyo Stock Exchange disclosed it had asked 10
securities firms, both Japanese and foreign, to limit orders for
index-linked arbitrage selling prior to the beginning of the
morning and afternoon sessions.
   But there will be no penalty for not following the request, said
Tokyo Stock Exchange spokesman Hironobu Takahashi.
   ``It is all right to do arbitrage deals when the index is rising
like today, but arbitrage selling will accelerate the market plunge
when the market is weak,'' he said.
   ``The purpose was to ask our member companies to cooperate and
save the market, and whether to take cooperative actions or not is
all up to the companies,'' Takahashi said.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he will watch if the
stock exchange's measures are effective in stabilizing the market.
   The stock exchange also eased its restrictions on credited
buying and reduced safety deposit money to 40 percent from 50
percent, he added.
   Such measures began with Tuesday's trading.

   A striped shellfish now clogging water system
pipelines and threatening the ecological balance of the Great Lakes
could make its way to rivers around the country in as little as
five years, scientists say.
   The rapidly producing zebra mussels could pose a significant
problem for manufacturing plants, many of which have miles of pipes
that draw cooling water, the experts warn.
   The mussels eventually will attach themselves to the insides of
pipes supplying factories and municipal water plants, in some cases
restricting flow, in the Allegheny, Ohio and Monongahela rivers,
said Thomas Nalepa, a biologist with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
   The Mississippi River basin also is vulnerable because Lake
Michigan, where the mussels are expected to arrive soon, is
connected to the Mississippi by the Chicago Canal.
   However, there is no reliable way to determine exactly when the
1{-inch mollusk will arrive in these or other rivers around the
country, scientists said.
   Zebra mussels, so named because of their brown and white zigzag
stripes, have been found in Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and Lake St.
Clair, near Detroit.
   They are growing on spawning reefs favored by walleye,
smallmouth bass and other fish in western Lake Erie, raising
concern about the future of a valuable fishery.
   Like barnacles, zebra mussels can travel by clinging to boat
hulls. They can survive out of water for perhaps up to 14 days by
living on internal moisture.
   ``Let's say someone from Pittsburgh were to trailer their boat
up to fish on Lake Erie and ended up with zebra mussels that
attached to their hull,'' said David Kelch, a specialist with Ohio
State University's sea grant program.
   ``They take their boat back to Pittsburgh and in a day or two
put the boat into a river or lake in that area. You've got them.''
   What's more, the larvae, or young, which are microscopic in
size, easily can attach themselves to an angler's minnow bucket, a
water nook in a boat trailer or the feathers of a duck.
   The zebra mussel originated in the Black and Caspian seas
between Europe and Asia. In 200 years, it has spread through much
of Europe. Two years ago, it was discovered in Lake St. Clair and
has infested water intakes for Erie, Toledo, Cleveland and Monroe,
Mich.
   The mussel reproduces at an astonishing rate. A single female
produces as many as 40,000 eggs each breeding season.
   The mollusk also has a voracious appetite for phytoplankton,
which are microscopic floating plants that form the bottom of the
food chain. Mussels could reduce the supply of phytoplankton for
microscopic animals called zooplankton. The zooplankton, in turn,
are eaten by smaller fish, which are eaten for food by larger fish.
   ``Anytime you impact the basic bottom building block of the food
chain, you're going to see an impact on the top predators _
walleye, smallmouth bass, yellow perch,'' Kelch said.

<HEAD>K mart to Charge $640 Million Against 1989 Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   K mart Corp., apparently aiming to match its
competitors' slicker, more contemporary stores, plans to take a
$640 million pretax charge against fourth-quarter results to cover
the cost of a huge modernization program.
   K mart officials said Monday the $2.3 billion program to open
new stores and modernize existing ones will take about five years.
   Company spokesman Orren Knauer declined to estimate K mart's
1989 earnings, which are to be announced March 8. But analysts with
Seidler-Amdec Securities Inc. of Los Angeles, Calif., predicted K
mart earnings would be about $730 million for the year, below the
$802.9 million it earned in 1988.
   The nation's second-largest retailer after Sears, Roebuck and
Co. will open about 250 new stores during the five-year program,
Knauer said.
   K mart plans to close 30 of its 2,194 U.S. stores, refurbish or
expand 1,880 stores and relocate 280. The only three stores left
out of the K mart plan already have the new look, Knauer said.
   Tom Tashjian, analyst with Seidler-Amdec said K mart was
slipping behind competitors Wal-Mart and Target in the discount
retail market. The latter two chains expanded more recently than K
mart.
   ``All the companies are about 25 years old, but K mart's
expansion was early on in that period,'' Tashjian said. ``The
others have expanded during the latter part of the 25 years so they
have younger, better-looking stores. Target is much more fun to
shop in.''
   K mart reported in November a 17.5-percent drop in third-quarter
profits to $104.1 million from a year earlier. The drop was blamed
on price cuts made to improve the company's market share.
   But Knauer denied that K mart decided to embark on the
five-year, billion-dollar plan in response to its competition.
   ``We made the decision because of internal factors,'' he said,
citing an 18-month pilot project during which several stores were
renovated or moved. ``It was based on Christmas sales and the
success of stores where we've already made changes.
   ``In the enlarged, relocated and prototyped stores, customer
acceptance of the layouts, fixturing and new merchandise
assortments has been very good, and sales results have exceeded
expectations.''
   K mart Chairman Joseph Antonini said the store enlargements and
relocations should be completed by 1993, and other refurbishments
will be done by 1994.
   ``K mart is taking a far more aggressive approach to modernize
their stores than they were planning before,'' Tashjian said. ``The
Wal-Mart and Target chains are clearly better at merchandise
presentation than K mart at this time.''
   K mart has 4,171 outlets in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada,
including 2,288 K mart stores, 1,258 Waldenbooks, 141 Builders
Square and 282 Pay Less Drug stores. The Troy-based company also
purchased PACE Membership Warehouse Inc. for $322 million late last
year.

government permission to sell and lease back its unfinished, $1
billion technical center, a move that would give the automaker a
needed cash infusion.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca has estimated the nation's No. 3
automaker invested about $1 billion in the research and engineering
center north of Detroit in Auburn Hills. Company officials maintain
the Chrysler Technology Center is crucial to the automaker's future.
   But some critics contend that Chrysler, which lost $664 million
in the fourth quarter of 1989, can't afford the facility. The
fourth-quarter loss, which included $577 million in write-offs for
auto plants Chrysler is closing, was the company's first quarterly
deficit since 1982.
   Chrysler in September sold half its 21.8-percent stake in
Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp. for an after-tax profit
of $310 million. In November, Chrysler said it was considering a
sale and lease back on the technical center to raise cash needed
for other operations.
   Earlier this month, the company sold its Gulfstream Aerospace
subsidiary for $825 million.
   According to the request filed Monday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Auburn Hills Trust, organized with the
assistance of Manufacturers Hanover Bank, proposes a public
offering of about $800 million in securities _ money that would be
used to pay for Chrysler's interest in the technical center.
   Auburn Hills Trust then would assign the lease to a third
company, Auburn Hills Trust Services, which in turn would rent the
property back to Chrysler and provide maintenance and other
services under a long-term contract.
   ``I know the papers were filed today, that's about all I know,''
company spokesman Steve Harris said from his home Monday night.
Other Chrysler officials couldn't immediately be reached for
comment.
   Chrysler employees are scheduled to start moving next month into
a training unit on the 500-acre site, with technical and design
staff slated to move to the 2.5 million-square-foot center in 1991
and 1992.
   Eventually, about 5,000 people will work at the center in the
1,100-acre Oakland Technology Park, a facility for high-tech
research, development and engineering.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Narrows to Lowest Level Since '84</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $113.2
billion last year, its lowest level since 1984, as exports of
manufactured products and farm goods posted sizable gains, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that the increased exports helped
overcome a continued increase in imports last year as the country
improved its trading position with almost every nation.
   The $113.2 billion deficit was an 11 percent improvement from a
$127.2 billion deficit in 1988. It stemmed from a 13.4 percent rise
in exports, which climbed to a record $361.9 billion. This offset a
6.4 percent increase in imports, which also hit an all-time high of
$475.1 billion.
   The trade deficit is the difference between imports and exports.
   Today's report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance
of payments basis confirmed an improvement already noted in the
Commerce Department's monthly merchandise trade reports. The totals
are slightly different because the new report excludes military
sales by the U.S. government and makes other minor adjustments in
the monthly figures.
   For the fourth quarter, the trade deficit posted an increase of
0.9 percent to $28.8 billion, following a deficirt of $28.6 billion
in the third quarter.
   This marked the second consecutive quarter in which the U.S.
trade deficit failed to improve, a trend analysts have termed
worrisome given the fact that the annual deficit remains stuck
above $100 billion.
   Economists have expressed fears that the deficit could begin
deteriorating again in 1990, which would be a blow to President
Bush's economic goals. The administration is hoping that further
sizable gains in exports will spur a resurgence in the U.S.
manufacturing sector, which has fallen on hard times in the past
year, particularly in the key auto industry.
   In the fourth quarter, exports climbed 1.6 percent to $92.1
billion but this gain was offset by a 1.4 percent gain in imports
which rose to $120.9 billion. Both imports and exports were at
record levels in the final three months of the year, the sixth
consecutive quarter they have set new highs.
   For the year, non-farm exports were up 14 percent to $320.4
billion, reflecting widespread increases, especially in capital
goods.
   U.S. farm sales increased 9 percent to $41.4 billion. The volume
of shipments of corn, wheat and sobybeans jumped 24 percent to
record levels, with one-half of that increase coming in higher
sales to the Soviet Union.
   The trade gains were held back, however, by a giant 28 percent
jump in petroleum imports, which rose to $50.3 billion, the highest
level since 1985. The average price per barrel increased to $17.08,
up from $14.34. The number of barrels imported daily increased to
8.06 million, the highest level since 1979, a year in which
shortages prompted long lines at gasoline pumps.
   Non-petroleum imports were also up last year, rising 4 percent
to $424.9 billion with the largest increases coming in capital
goods and consumer goods. However, imports of cars from Japan
declined for the third consecutive year, reflecting in part the
fact that more Japanese models are being manufactured in plants
located in the United States.

<TEXT>
   Turner Broadcasting System Inc., which bought
nearly $10 million worth of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. short-term
debt shortly before the Wall Street firm filed for bankruptcy court
protection, is suing the company for alleged fraud and violation of
securities laws.
   Turner is asking for $7 million in compensatory and punitive
damages, plus attorney fees, because the promissory notes ``have
not and will not'' be paid.
   The cable programming company bought a $4.96 million Drexel
promissory note, due Feb. 23, on Jan. 24, and another, at a cost of
$4.99 million, on Feb. 11. Two days later, Drexel filed for federal
bankruptcy protection from its creditors, including Turner
Broadcasting.
   A promissory note is a written promise to pay a specific sum of
money on a certain date.
   In its suit filed last week in federal court in Atlanta, Turner
Broadcasting charged Drexel with fraud and violating state and
federal securities laws for not disclosing the New York firm's
deteriorating financial condition.
   Last October, Drexel underwrote $550 million worth of Turner
Broadcasting high-risk debt, known as junk bonds, which the Atlanta
firm used to refinance long-term obligations. Drexel also
underwrote most of the $1.5 billion that Turner Broadcasting paid
nearly four years ago for MGM-UA Entertainment Co.
   Turner Broadcasting said in the lawsuit it will not pay $3
million it owes Drexel on a note Turner Broadcasting issued on Feb.
12.

<HEAD>Retailer Posts Record Quarterly, Annual Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Woolworth Corp. on Tuesday reported a 22 percent
increase in fourth-quarter net income and a 14 percent gain for all
of last year.
   The growth lifted the quarterly and annual profits to record
levels and came on revenue gains of 9.8 percent in the three months
ended Jan. 27 and 9.1 percent in the entire year.
   Revenue from Woolworth's specialty operation, such as the Kinney
shoe store chain, expanded 17 percent while general merchandise
revenue rose 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter. Domestically,
revenue grew 12 percent while foreign growth was 7.6 percent.
   During all of last year, specialty stores also had higher
revenue growth than general merchandise stores. Revenue from
specialty stores grew 19 percent in 1989 compared with a 3.1
percent rise for general merchandise revenue. Revenue was up 9.9
percent in 1989 in the United States vs. 8 percent abroad.
   The New York-based retailer said it earned $175 million, or
$2.73 a share, on revenue of $2.79 billion in the fourth quarter.
That was up from income of $144 milion, or $2.23 a share, and
revenue of $2.55 billion a year earlier.
   For all of 1989, Woolworth earned $329 million, or $5.11 a
share, up from $288 million, or $4.47 a share, in 1988. Revenue
rose last year to $8.82 billion from $8.09 billion.
   Woolworth owns dozens of specialty chains including Foot Locker,
the name brand athletic shoe retailer, Lady Foot Locker and Champs,
a sporting goods chain. It also is the holding company for the
Woolworth variety stores.
   Harold E. Sells, Woolworth's chairman and chief executive
officer, said so far in 1990 sales have been strong both in the
United States and abroad.
   However, he said interest expense in the current first quarter
will be greater than in 1989's first quarter.

   The stock market continued to advance this
morning amid increasing investor confidence after a moderate rally
on Monday.
   Blue chips resumed their climb of Monday after an ambivalent
start this morning. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks,
which was unchanged at 10 a.m. on Wall Street, was up 6.98 at
2,609.46 an hour later.
   Gainers outpaced losers among issues listed on the New York
Stock Exchange by more than a 3-to-2 margin, with 603 up, 387 down
and 509 unchanged.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.54 to 181.80.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 49.6 million shares
after the first 90 minutes of trading.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.14
to 350.50.
   A partial recovery today in Tokyo after a key measure of the
world's biggest equities market took its second steepest one-day
plunge ever on Monday was reassuring for U.S. investors, analysts
said.
   Sentiment also was helped by the U.S. market's ability to
weather the Tokyo jolt without any negative consequences.
   Investors, meanwhile, were reluctant to read too much
significance into a tumble in orders to U.S. factories for durable
goods. Stocks barely budged in response to the news, market
watchers said.
   The January drop of 10.5 percent, the biggest decline since the
government began keeping track of the figures, was seen as further
evidence of a slumping manufacturing sector. However, analysts
noted the orders are volatile and often subject to large revisions.
   American Express headed the list of actively trading stocks on
the Big Board. The company, which slumped 1 to 27}, has announced
it will pump an additional $750 million in its Shearson Lehman
securities unit after making a $250 million infusion in December.

<TEXT>
   The holding company of Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. is working on an employee
retention plan for executives who might be tempted to join a rival
retailer.
   The plan being developed by Federated Stores Inc. must be
approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. before it goes
into effect.
   Federated and Allied, two U.S. retailing businesses owned by
Canada's Campeau Corp., filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law on Jan. 15 in the biggest
retail bankruptcy filing in history.
   Carol Sanger, spokeswoman for the U.S. holding company, said
today the plan will consist of ``various performance and retention
incentives and a reaffirmation of contracts and other benefits.''
   She declined to be more specific but said the plan would not
include salary increases for executives or improvements in health
coverage.
   The employee retention plan will be presented to Aug in early
March, Ms. Sanger said.
   ``These are benefits which will keep us competitive with other
executives in the retail industry,'' Ms. Sanger said. ``We do not
want to lose anybody to another retailer.''
   Analysts said employee retention plans are commonplace in the
competitive retailing industry. They're aimed at preventing
executives, from upper management to divisional officers, from
jumping to rival stores.
   ``Those executives, usually at the middle-management level, who
shine are always in demand,'' said Marc P. Schappell of Egon
Zehnder International, a New York-based management recruitment firm.
   Ms. Sanger said the plan is a necessary step for Federated.
   ``We cannot operate at a severe disadvantage in this environment
that we're dealing in. It would not be in the companies' best
interest,'' she said.
   So far, Federated and Allied executives haven't left in large
numbers, according to management recruitment firms.
   ``They see themselves as being on the first team,'' said Roger
Kenny of Kenny, Kindler, Hunt &amp; Howe, a New York recruiting firm.
``Why leave the Yankees to go to the farm team?''
   The companies have taken several steps since filing the Chapter
11 petition five weeks ago. Aug has approved a special $700 million
financial package that provided fresh lines of credit to the
companies.
   Several ``business-as-usual'' motions _ from retention of
employee benefits to allowing distributors to resume liquor
shipments to a downtown Chicago Bloomingdale's store _ have been
approved.
   And about 96 percent of the stores' top 117 merchandise
suppliers have resumed shipments of apparel.
   ``We have moved so far beyond our difficult situation at the
time of the filing that it has amazed even some of us,'' Ms. Sanger
said.
   ``Nobody in the industry, no analysts or other retail executives
expected us to accomplish as much as we have. Our mission now is to
maintain this positive operational environment,'' she said.

   Crop futures prices were narrowly mixed in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade with weather factors
keeping a lid on the corn and soybean markets.
   The National Weather Service on Monday predicted above-normal
precipitation early next week across a large portion of the
nation's midsection, including areas of western Iowa, Minnesota and
Nebraska that have remained quite dry since the 1988 drought.
   Soybean futures were struggling to rebound, though, after
significant losses in the last three sessions.
   ``I think they're trying to have a little technical
correction,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Buying continued to lift the March wheat contract amid
perceptions of tight deliverable supplies. Other wheat futures were
lower despite news that the Agriculture Department had accepted
bids from Morocco for more than 100,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat
at subsidized prices.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 1\ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $3.97{ a bushel;
corn futures were unchanged to 2 cents lower with March at $2.46 a
bushel; oat futures were unchanged to { cent lower with March at
$1.36{ a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 1{ cents higher with March
at $5.62\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .35 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
April at 74.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to
.10 cent higher with March at 79.75 cents a pound; live hogs were
.20 cent to .45 cent lower with April at 49.50 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .15 cent to .87 cent lower with March at
52.55 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Monday.

   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said Tuesday it
had record sales and profits for the fourth quarter and for the
year ended Jan. 31.
   Wal-Mart said its fourth-quarter net income increased 32 percent
to $425.9 million, or 75 cents a share, from $323.2 million, or 57
cents a share, in the final quarter of 1988.
   Sales totaled $8.1 billion compared with $6.5 billion a year
earlier, a gain of 24 percent.
   For the year, the nation's third-largest discount retailer said
its earnings jumped 28.5 percent to $1.1 billion, or $1.90 a share,
from $837 million, or $1.48 a share, the year before. Sales rose to
$25 billion, up 25 percent from $20.6 billion.
   ``We are extremely pleased to report another record year of
sales and earnings,'' David Glass, Wal-Mart president and chief
executive officer, said in a written statement. ``We remain
committed to our everyday low-pricing program on name-brand
merchandise while working to exceed our customer's expectations of
service.''
   As of Jan. 31, the company operated 1,402 Wal-Mart stores, 123
Sam's Wholesale Clubs and three Hypermart-USA units compared with
1,259 Wal-Mart stores, 105 Sam's Wholesale Clubs, 14 dot Discount
Drug stores and one Hypermart-USA unit at the same time last year.
The sale of the dot Discount Drug stores was effective Feb. 1.
   Glass said the company's 1990 plans call for aggressive
expansion.
   ``We believe the new year will be an intensively competitive
environment but should provide a great opportunity for us to
perform in a manner consistent with prior years,'' he said.
   Wal-Mart operates in 29 states.

<TEXT>
   The founder of Crazy Eddie Inc. faces
criminal contempt charges after he failed to appear today before a
federal judge to answer demands he return $52 million to the United
States.
   Judge Nicholas H. Politan ordered U.S. marshals to bring Eddie
Antar before him and said a civil trial against Antar and two
family members would proceed without the reclusive founder.
   Politan set a May 1 trial date for Antar, his brother, Mitchell,
and his cousin, Sam E. Antar, all charged with securities
violations.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission claims in a lawsuit the
missing money may have been gained through insider trading.
   Jack Arseneault, Antar's attorney, told the judge he did not
know Antar's whereabouts. The judge ordered a closed hearing today
to question Arseneault further about Antar's whereabouts.
   Earlier this month, Politan ordered Antar to repatriate the
money by Feb. 7, but Antar refused through his attorney, citing his
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
   Antar allegedly transferred the $52 million in 1987 to bank
accounts in Israel. Arseneault has argued that to return the money
would be self-incriminating because it would be tantamount to an
admission that the money is there. Politan has rejected that
argument.
   Politan had ordered Antar on Feb. 7 to appear in person if he
was going to use the Fifth Amendment. Two days later, Politan
issued an arrest warrant on civil contempt charges after Antar
failed to show.
   At the time, an angry Politan ordered marshals to ``spare no
expense'' to capture Antar. Antar turned himself in to marshals on
Feb. 13.
   He was released and was to appear today.
   The SEC said in its lawsuit Antar directed a financial fraud to
falsify the company's income, and reaped illegal profits through
the sale of his stock at artificially inflated prices. The 43-store
empire collapsed last year.

   The Boeing Co. did not violate a federal
conflict-of-interest law when the defense contractor paid $485,000
in severance to five employees who left to take government jobs,
the Supreme Court ruled today.
   By a 9-0 vote, the justices overturned a ruling, supported by
the Bush administration, that the money must be turned over to the
government.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said the
payments ``give rise to a possible appearance of impropriety.''
   But he said the conflict-of-interest law also permits
``corporations to encourage qualified employees to make their
special skills available to the government.''
   As long as the employee has not begun working for the
government, the law does not prohibit the payment, Stevens said.
   He said any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of government
contractors and employees receiving severance pay ``until Congress
plainly states that we have misconstrued'' the law.
   The law makes it a crime for any private party to pay, and a
government employee to receive, supplemental compensation for the
employee's government service. The statute is one of many federal
laws aimed at prevent bribery, graft and conflicts of interest.
   Today's decision reversed a 1988 ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals that said Boeing paid the money illegally to the
employees to compensate them for taking lower-paying jobs in the
Reagan administration.
   The Bush administration urged the Supreme Court to uphold the
appeals court ruling.
   Justice Department lawyers said the payments ``were classic
violations'' of federal law because they were calculated to make up
the difference between the employees' salaries at Boeing and their
government pay.
   In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said the company was
pleased by the decision and feels vindicated after almost eight
years of legal questions surrounding the payments.
   The payments compensated employees for accrued sick leave,
unused benefits and stock options and ``were always completely open
and aboveboard and disclosed to the government,'' he said.
   ``It's not only a victory for Boeing but a victory for the
government because it means that qualified people will not feel
impeded in taking their industry-developed experience and expertise
in to government positions,'' Binder added.
   Boeing stopped making such payments following the initial legal
challenge. The company needs to study the high court's decision
before deciding whether to resume them, Binder said.
   The five former employees are:
   Thomas K. Jones, who received $132,000 from Boeing before
becoming deputy undersecretary of defense for strategic and theater
nuclear forces in 1981; Herbert A. Reynolds, $80,000, deputy
director of space and intelligence policy in 1981; Melvin R.
Paisley, $183,000, assistant secretary of the Navy for research,
engineering and systems in 1981.
   Also, Lawrence H. Crandon, $40,000, a computer scientist for the
NATO air command and control systems in 1982; and Harold Kitson,
$50,000, deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for command,
communications and control intelligence in 1982.
   The former employees said in their appeal to the Supreme Court
that they were not responsible for Pentagon contracting or
procurement and that they had exemplary records with the government.
   They said there was no question of divided loyalties for any of
them because each received ``an irrevocable severance payment''
before entering government service.
   Paisley became a defense consultant after leaving the Pentagon
in 1987. His name arose in a Justice Department investigation of
trafficking in confidential bid information on government
contracts, but he was never charged criminally.
   His lawyers, in response to court documents, denied that Paisley
violated the law.
   The cases are Crandon vs. U.S., 88-931, and Boeing vs. U.S.,
88-938.

<HEAD>Foreign Secretary Looks Forward To East Bloc Membership in EC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Tuesday the
European Community should offer the countries of Eastern Europe
which have shed Communism an ``association agreement'' which would
eventually lead to full membership.
   ``I do not know on what basis that (full membership) could be
denied once they have achieved full democracy and market
economies,'' Hurd told 3,000 members of the Institute of Directors,
Britain's main employers' group, at their annual convention.
   The foreign secretary said the 12-nation European Community
should offer each Eastern European country ``an association
agreement which can gradually be increased and enriched as that
country moves forward with its political and economic reforms.''
   Hurd said the European Community needed to respond to the
liberalized Eastern bloc by holding out a hand, not only of
friendship, but of practical help and cooperation.
   He said the countries of Eastern Europe ``seem to have grasped''
the need to adopt policies which would lead to an enterprise
culture and creation of wealth ``with remarkable speed.''
   Answering questions, Hurd said countries such as Romania and
Bulgaria had a long way to go before they could become full EC
members. But he also noted that Greece, Spain and Portugal had all
joined the European Community after getting rid of dictatorial
governments.
   Hurd also urged British firms to get in ``on the ground floor''
as Eastern governments turned towards capitalism, citing ``an
immense expansion of markets for goods and services.''

<HEAD>Official Attempts to Steer Japanese Markets Seen as Muddled</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actions by Japan's financial regulators and stock
exchange officials to calm troubled markets in recent days appeared
sometimes contradictory and in many cases ineffective, traders and
analysts said Tuesday.
   Stock prices plunged on a day when officials asked stock market
participants to limit program trading some have blamed for
worsening recent price declines.
   The government also has intervened in the currency markets to
support the value of the Japanese yen and in the bond market to
push interest rates lower _ which tends to depress the yen.
   Regulators are trying to settle a Tokyo Stock Exchange whose key
index has plunged by 14 percent this year, partly due to worries
about rising inflation and higher interest rates.
   On Monday, the exchange asked securities houses to limit
arbitrage dealings whe the stock market is declining. Arbitrage
programs, involving rapid trading of huge numbers of shares to
profit from price discrepancies between stocks and stock-index
futures, has been blamed for worsening price declines.
   But with arbitragers inactive Monday, the stock market took its
biggest plunge since the October 1987 crash. On Tuesday, despite
some $201 million worth of arbitrage-selling and a temporary
decline, the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
closed 576.08 points higher.
   ``It is rather difficult to evaluate the market reaction from
just one day of trading,'' stock exchange spokesman Hironobu
Takahashi said Tuesday, ``but I believe our member firms understood
our request and tried to cooperate.''
   New York-based Salomon Brothers, one of the leading arbitrage
firms in Tokyo, stated Tuesday that, ``The action taken yesterday
may do more harm than good. It does not address the fundamental
factors driving the market.''
   ``All the finger-pointing at arbitrage is wrong,'' said Kevin
Parker, director of futures and options at Morgan Stanley, another
big American arbitrage player. ``Less than 5 percent of daily
volume has been arbitrage-selling. It can't really explain the
correction in the market.''
   Parker said market fundamentals, such as rising interest rates
and inflation, accounted for the downturn.
   These problems have been the target of divergent actions by the
Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan.
   The Finance Ministry primarily is interested with protecting
government bond prices, thereby curbing interest rate rises and
promoting economic expansion, said Jason James, a strategic analyst
with James Capel Pacific. However, the central bank is concerned
with battling inflation and supporting the value of the yen _ which
are achieved by raising interest rates, James said.
   The ministry also reportedly was concerned that higher interest
rates would cause Japanese investments to flow back from overseas,
particularly from the United States.
   The Finance Ministry has intervened three times in the last
week, its first bond market intervention since 1987, purchasing
$604 million worth of 10-year government bonds on Monday in an
attempt to raise their prices and reduce their yields.
   Monday's intervention reduced yields on the benchmark 10-year
government bond to 6.875 percent from a high of 7.015 percent.
However, the ministry stayed out of the market Tuesday and the
yield climbed to 6.91 percent.
   Bond dealer Shinji Kokubun of Sanwa Bank suggested the ministry
may have to spend a lot more to get the job done.
   ``The Finance Ministry's buying operation does not have an
immediate effect. As far as I know, it works gradually,'' he said.
   The ministry's efforts may aid the stock and bond markets but
they seemed to diverge from the central bank's moves to depress
interest rates.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno on Monday refused to rule
out a widely anticipated increase in the bank's official discount
rate to battle inflation.
   ``We don't change monetary policy only because stock prices ...
or the yen move rapidly. ... We have to consider carefully what the
interest rate increases will bring, how prices will change in the
future,'' he said.
   The central bank regards the discount rate, the interest it
charges commercial banks for loans, as a key weapon against
inflation. It raised the rate three times in 1989, bringing it from
2.5 percent to the present 4.25 percent, but inflation continues to
threaten due to rising oil and labor prices.
   The central bank's currency operations, its other weapon against
inflation, also have been hindered by market forces.
   The bank reportedly spent $2 billion Tuesday to bolster the yen,
but the dollar rose 0.38 yen and closed at 149.03 yen, its highest
level since last June 15. The weaker yen makes imported items, such
as oil, more expensive in Japan.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shares on London's Stock Exchange finished a
confident session slightly higher Tuesday, calmed by relative
stability in overseas equity markets.
   London investors were heartened by a gain in Tokyo after recent
sharp plunges. The Nikkei average closed 576.08 points higher at
33,897.95 on Tuesday.
   ``There's a temptation to believe that the dramatic moves in
Tokyo are of Japan's making and only their making,'' a dealing
director at a London investment firm said. ``It's a consensus
feeling that Tokyo was looking too expensive for too long and that
some fundamental correction was long overdue.''
   Wall Street's performance in the last 48 hours also has been
encouraging, dealers said.
   The Dow Jones industrial average stood 23.42 points higher at
2,625.90 as the London session drew to a close Tuesday, following a
38-point advance Monday.
   However, if the Japanese market declines again, the other
markets will be sorely tested, said the head of market making at
another London firm.
   At London's close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was 5.5 points, or 0.2 percent, higher at 2,254.8, off its
session high of 2,257.5 but above its low of 2,249.2 points.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 5.4 points at 1,781.5
points at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index finished
at 1,224.32, up 4.62 points.
   Volume came to a modest 362 million shares, compared with 339
million shares Monday.

   The stock market continued to climb today amid
increasing investor confidence after a moderate rally on Monday.
   Blue chips extended their advance and the Dow Jones average of
30 industrial stocks rose 21.84 to 2,624.32 by 2 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outpaced losers among issues listed on the New York
Stock Exchange by about a 13-to-7 margin, with 938 up, 501 down and
476 unchanged.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks went up
1.36 to 182.62.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 112.31 million
shares with two hours left to go in the session.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.99
to 351.35.
   A partial recovery earlier in Tokyo after a key measure of the
world's biggest equities market took its second steepest one-day
plunge ever on Monday was reassuring for U.S. investors, analysts
said.
   Sentiment also was helped by the U.S. market's ability to cope
calmly with the Tokyo setback.
   Investors, meanwhile, were reluctant to read too much
significance into a tumble in orders to U.S. factories for durable
goods. Stocks barely budged in response to the news, market
watchers said.
   The January drop of 10.5 percent, the biggest decline since the
government began keeping track of the figures, was seen as further
evidence of a slumping manufacturing sector. However, analysts
noted the orders are volatile and often subject to large revisions.
   American Express led the Big Board's list of actively trading
stocks, slumping ~ to 27~. It announced it will pump an additional

   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $113.2
billion last year, the smallest since 1984, despite the highest
level of foreign oil imports in 10 years, the government reported
Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said the deficit shrank by 11 percent
from an imbalance of $127.2 billion in 1988, reflecting continued
growth in American exports, especially manufactured goods and
agricultural products.
   The 13.4 percent increase in exports, which rose to a record
$361.9 billion, more than offset a 6.4 percent gain in imports,
which also hit an all-time high of $475.1 billion.
   Tuesday's report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance
of payments basis confirmed trends already noted in the
department's monthly merchandise trade reports, which showed a
deficit for all of 1989 of $108.6 billion.
   The new figure is higher because it excludes military sales by
the U.S. government and makes other minor adjustments in the
monthly figures.
   For the fourth quarter, the trade deficit posted an increase of
0.9 percent to $28.8 billion, following a deficit of $28.6 billion
in the third quarter.
   It marked the second consecutive quarter in which the trade
deficit failed to show improvement, and private economists
expressed fears that the deficit could begin widening again in 1990.
   A higher trade deficit would spell trouble for the Bush
administration, which is counting on further export growth to prop
up the U.S. economy.
   One of the most ominous signs for the future is the surge in oil
imports, which shot up 28 percent last year to $50.3 billion. The
price per barrel rose to $17.08, up from $14.34 in 1988, while the
number of barrels imported daily increased to 8.06 million, the
highest level since 1979, a year in which Americans sat in gasoline
lines because of shortages.
   Non-petroleum imports were also up last year, rising 4 percent
to $424.9 billion. Car imports from Japan declined for the third
consecutive year, reflecting the fact that more Japanese models are
being manufactured in plants located in the United States.
   Non-farm exports were up 14 percent to $320.4 billion last year,
reflecting increases in consumer goods and manufactured capital
goods, especially commercial aircraft.
   U.S. farm sales increased 9 percent to $41.4 billion. The volume
of shipments of corn, wheat and soybeans jumped 24 percent to
record levels, with one-half of that increase coming in higher
sales to the Soviet Union, the government reported.
   In the fourth quarter, exports climbed 1.6 percent to $92.1
billion but this was offset by a 1.4 percent increase in imports
which rose to $120.9 billion. Both imports and exports were at
record levels in the final three months of the year, the sixth
consecutive quarter they have set new highs.
   But Paul Getman, an economist with Regional Financial
Associates, said that U.S. export growth for manufactured goods is
likely to slow in coming months, reflecting higher interest rates
in such countries as Japan and West Germany. Higher interest rates
dampen demand by raising the cost of borrowing for both businesses
and consumers.
   The $113.2 billion trade deficit for 1989 was the smallest
imbalance since a $112.5 billion deficit in 1984, the first year
that the trade deficit climbed above the $100 billion mark.

<TEXT>
   Lotus Development Corp. on Tuesday unveiled a
long-promised version of its popular 1-2-3 computer spreadsheet
program for IBM mainframe computers.
   The program, 1-2-3-M, allows personal computer users to pull
data from a mainframe computer file and transfer it directly into
the 1-2-3 spreadsheet.
   Lotus and International Business Machines Corp. said the
software could cut days off the the traditional procedure, in which
data from a mainframe often must be altered so that it may be
entered into a 1-2-3 spreadsheet on a personal computer.
   Spreadsheet programs allow the display of rows and columns of
figures or bar graphs to represent such things as a company's sales
or profits. They are among the most popular programs for personal
computers and 1-2-3 is the leading personal computer spreadsheet.
   The move into mainframes represents the second foray by the
Cambridge, Mass.-based company into software for other types of
computers. Last month, Lotus introduced a spreadsheet program for
workstations made by Sun Microsystems Inc. It also is believed to
be developing a version of 1-2-3 for minicomputers made by Digital
Equipment Corp.
   Lotus and IBM signed an agreement in April 1987 to jointly
develop a spreadsheet program for IBM mainframes. The program
originally was to be released in early 1988. Other versions of
1-2-3 also have suffered lengthy introduction delays due to
programming bugs and other problems.
   At a news conference, Lotus Vice President Frank Moss said one
possible use for 1-2-3-M would be for a retail-store chain to
transfer sales data from spreadsheets on personal computers in its
stores to a mainframe computer at company headquarters.
   IBM said Sears, Roebuck and Co. is one of about two dozen
companies that have been using a preliminary version of 1-2-3-M
since August.
   Users do not need to know the computer commands for the
mainframe computer. The Lotus program automatically transfers data
from personal computers to the mainframe, and vice versa.
   During the delay in introducing 1-2-3-M, a new type of computer
setup may have reduced the need for the product, some industry
analysts say. That setup involves a ``file server,'' a high-powered
desktop computer that acts as a central repository for a network of
personal computers. Existing versions of 1-2-3 can run on file
servers.
   However, Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., said
the new version of 1-2-3 should appeal to companies that have a
mainframe computer in place and want to tie it to personal
computers through the spreadsheet.
   Sherlund said 1-2-3-M should account for less than $5 million of
Lotus' estimated 1990 revenue of $750 million. But, he said, ``It's
more significant from a strategic vantage point'' since it should
allow Lotus to maintain its foothold in major corporations.
   ``Their strategy, I think, is to basically cover all their bases
and offer products that run across the broad spectrum of hardware
installed in corporate America,'' he said.
   IBM will be the sole marketer of the program, which is designed
for use on IBM's System-370 computer line. Sherlund said he
believes Lotus will receive less than half the revenue.
   The software, which will be available next month, ranges in
price from about $15,000 to $48,000, depending on the size of the
computer system. In addition, monthly licensing charges of $583 to
$1,800 are assessed, the companies said.

<HEAD>Greyhound Changing Name to Disassociate From Bus Company Problems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dogged by an unclear corporate image, Greyhound
Corp. announced Tuesday it is changing its name to Greyhound Dial
Corp. to distinguish itself from the troubled nationwide Greyhound
busline that it formerly owned.
   ``This name change will help clarify who we are and what we
do,'' Greyhound Dial Chairman John W. Teets told a news conference
in New York.
   The company, a diversified manufacturing and financial services
concern based in Phoenix, sold the bus line in 1987 to Dallas
investor Fred Currey, who later merged it with the Trailways bus
system and renamed the operation Greyhound Lines Inc. Its drivers
have threatened to strike on Friday in a wage dispute.
   Teets said the new name was chosen because of the importance of
the company's Dial Corp. subsidiary, a consumer products maker with
brands ranging from Dial soap to Purex detergents to Lunch Bucket
microwave meals.
   He said the word Greyhound was retained as part of the name
because it is an integral part of the name of several other
subsidiaries, such as Greyhound Financial Corp. and Greyhound Food
Management.
   ``For the corporation to abandon the Greyhound name would be a
genuine blow to these companies,'' he said.
   The company's board of directors approved the name change on
Feb. 15.
   Clive Chajet, an expert on corporate name changes, said the
company is ``attempting to redefine the word Greyhound to be more
than a bus service.''
   Greyhound as a bus service is a ``well engrained symbol,'' he
said.
   Name changes usually are an expression of a company's long-term
strategy rather than a reaction to a specific event, said Chajet,
the chairman of Lippincott &amp; Margulies Inc., a corporate image
consulting firm.
   Asked why the company had waited until now to make the name
change, Teets said it had been studying such a move for a few
years, but the threatened strike at Greyhound Lines ``was kind of
the last grain of sand in the hourglass.''
   He didn't rule out eliminating the word Greyhound from the
company name in the future.
   As a reflection of the confusion caused by the Greyhound name,
Teets said, the company's switchboard had been deluged with calls
from the press seeking details about the possible bus strike. The
company also was concerned that institutional investors might think
it was involved in the strike.
   ``We're not involved in any way at all,'' Teets said. He
declined to comment on the bus line's labor trouble.
   Greyhound was primarily known for its bus service until 1987,
when it sold the line to Currey for $270 million. Its main
businesses now are consumer products, financial services and
catering.
   A strike by drivers at Greyhound Lines would disrupt the
country's only nationwide bus system, serving 9,500 communities.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed narrowly
mixed Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade with the March wheat
contract posting its first daily decline in a week.
   The contract for March delivery of wheat had risen a total of 14
cents a bushel during the four previous sessions amid perceptions
of near-term supply tightness.
   Wednesday is the first day for traders to declare intentions to
deliver wheat against the contract and Thursday is the first
delivery day.
   March wheat began Tuesday's session slightly higher but fell
late in the session on selling that began when one large
independent speculator took profits, said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   The price tumbled nearly 5 cents a bushel, then recovered to
close with a loss of less than 2 cents after buying interest was
stirred by indications that China had bid for 300,000 metric tons
of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Corn futures slipped in reaction to forecasts for above-normal
precipitation early next week in dry areas of the Corn Belt.
Soybeans were narrowly mixed.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2} cents lower to 1 cent higher
with March down 1} cents at $3.94{ a bushel; corn futures were 1\
cents to 1} cents lower with March at $2.44} a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 1 cent lower with March at $1.36{ a bushel; soybeans

   The stock market steadied at higher levels this
afternoon amid improved investor confidence following Monday's
moderate rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 16.44 to
2,618.92 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outpaced losers among issues listed on the New York
Stock Exchange by about 9upport Tuesday
for a Caribbean-led effort to call attention to alleged human
rights abuses in Haiti.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler noted that the
Organization of American States had unanimously approved a
resolution Friday calling for a visit to Haiti by the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.
   ``We believe the resolution signals to Haitian authorities that
the international community expects it to honor its commitment to
establish a democratic government and restore respect for human
rights,'' she said.
   Last month, the government of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril declared a
state of siege and arrested a number of opposition political
leaders. It also ordered strict censorship of the news media.
   The OAS resolution was introduced by Jamaica and other Caribbean
countries.
   ``This resolution and the Caribbean Community's leadership in
securing its approval sets the stage for renewed regional impetus
for democracy in Haiti,'' she said.

   The dollar finished lower against most major
currencies in European trading Tuesday.
   Nonetheless, dealers said there was no rush to sell the U.S.
currency. Instead, the dollar's retreat largely reflected the scale
of selling in recent days by the Bank of Japan, which has
intervened to prop up the yen, they said.
   Late in the day, dollar was quoted at 1.6836 Deutsche marks,
down from 1.6903 marks late Monday in London.
   The dollar also ended the European day at 148.57 yen, down from
149.03 yen at the close in Tokyo earlier.
   Other dollar rates compared with late Monday's rates, included:
1.4857 Swiss francs, down from 1.4865; 5.7010 French francs, down
from 5.7205; 1.8985 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9023; 1,245.25
Italian lire, down from 1,250.25; and 1.1908 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1975.
   The British pound traded at $1.6915 late Tuesday, lower than
$1.6927 late Monday.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $407.25 a troy
ounce, down from $411.75 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $411.25, unchanged from late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.30 to close at a bid $407.85.
   Silver closed in London at a bid price of $5.11 a troy ounce,
from Monday's $5.23.

<HEAD>Unilever Posts Profit Gains in Fourth Quarter, Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer
products giant, on Tuesday reported a 12 percent gain in net profit
for 1989's fourth quarter, boosted by strong sales growth from its
existing and newly acquired businesses.
   Unilever said its net profit for the three months ended Dec. 31
totaled the equivalent of $470 million, up from $419 million in the
same period a year earlier.
   Sales rose 20 percent to $9.75 billion from $8.14 billion.
   For the year, net profit rose 12 percent to $1.69 billion from
$1.51 billion in 1988. Sales jumped 11 percent to $34.4 billion, up
from $30.9 billion.
   Chairman Michael Angus said the British pound's fall against
most other currencies over the year aided the company's earnings.
   ``But even when taking out this effect, there was a good
improvement,'' Angus said.
   Angus said profit margins were up an average 9 percent on the
year, with the strongest gains coming in North American operations,
where margins improved 10 percent.
   Unilever's 55 acquisitions during the year included the $1.55
billion purchase of the Faberge and Elizabeth Arden cosmetics lines
from Faberge Inc., completed in July, and the purchase of the
Calvin Klein fragrance business.
   The company has been particularly eager to boost its presence in
the upscale end of the personal products area, in which it now
claims a global market share of 10 percent.
   Among Unilever's well-known U.S. products are Dove soap, Wisk
detergent, Ragu spaghetti sauce and Lipton tea.

<TEXT>
   Eddie Antar, the founder of Crazy Eddie
Inc., faces criminal contempt charges after he failed to appear
Tuesday before a federal judge to answer demands he return $52
million to the United States.
   U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan, meanwhile, ordered a
civil lawsuit to proceed against Antar while U.S. marshals hunt him
down.
   Antar has repeatedly ignored warnings by Politan to appear in
court or be jailed, but Tuesday's action marked the first criminal
finding against him. The U.S. Attorney has been seeking a criminal
indictment.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is suing Antar, two
family members and several associates, accusing them of reaping
millions of dollars through fraudulent record keeping and insider
trading.
   Politan ordered that trial to begin May 1.
   ``Mr. Antar will be found and he will appear,'' Politan said.
   Antar, through his attorney, refused a Feb. 7 order by Politan
to return $52 million to the United States that the SEC said was in
an Israeli bank account.
   Antar's attorney, Jack Arseneault, argued at the time that
repatriating the money would violate Antar's Fifth Amendtment right
against self-incrimination.
   Politan rejected that argument and said if Antar wanted to
invoke the Fifth, he would have to do so in person. The judge then
ordered him to appear the next day to explain why he should not be
held in contempt for keeping the money in Israel.
   When Antar did not appear, Politan found Antar in civil contempt
and ordered U.S. marshals to ``spare no expense'' in bringing the
fugitive before him.
   Antar, 42, founder of the discount electronics chain,
surrendered to marshals Feb. 13 but was released with the agreement
that he return before the judge on Tuesday.
   When he did not, Politan found him in criminal contempt, which
carries a penalty of up to six months in prison.
   Arseneault said in an interview that Antar has contacted him by
phone, but he does not know his client's whereabouts. He would not
comment on Antar's reasons for violating the court orders.
   Antar's 43-outlet store empire collapsed last year.

<HEAD>Retailer Says FTC Closed Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Benetton Group SpA announced Tuesday that the
Federal Trade Commission has closed an investigation into the
fairness of certain U.S. business practices of the Italian apparel
maker and retailer.
   The FTC informed Benetton in a letter Feb. 5 that the matter had
been closed and that it wouldn't initiate any proceedings against
the company, Benetton said.
   The investigation, which began in late 1988, first came to light
last June. Benetton disclosed in a prospectus for a sale of
securities in the United States that the regulatory agency had
undertaken a preliminary probe.
   The government probe had been aimed at determining whether
Benetton should be considered a franchiser and therefore subject to
federal franchise rules. It focused on the company's relationships
with owners of Benetton boutiques in the United States.
   Benetton said in a news release it was gratified that the FTC
has decided not to take action against the company. Benetton
consistently maintained throughout the investigation that it wasn't
a franchiser, under the FTC definition, and that it had not engaged
in unfair or deceptive business practices.
   A violation of franchise rules can result in civil penalties of
up to $10,000 a day. The FTC also has the power to seek civil
remedies in court on behalf of owners, investors or others.
   A number of U.S. store owners previously alleged in bankruptcy
court proceedings that Benetton had acted unfairly and violated
franchise rules and other statutes.
   One store owner had threatened to file a class action lawsuit on
behalf of all owners that have challenged the way Benetton does
business.
   Federal law requires franchisers to make detailed disclosures
before selling a franchise. Franchisers must obey various federal
laws intended to protect business owners from abusive practices.
Some states also have statutes that apply specifically to
franchisors.
   Benetton markets its colorful clothing for women, men and
children through independently owned Benetton retail stores. There
are more than 700 Benetton stores in the United States.

   Placing further limits on tobacco and alcohol
advertising could push more sports programming from broadcast
television to pay-TV outlets, drive some magazines out of business
and eliminate thousands of jobs in the media industry, a new report
said Tuesday.
   Critics said the report failed to reflect the possibility that
other advertisers likely would fill any void left by a decline in
tobacco and alcohol products advertising.
   The report was released by a group of advertisers, media
companies and ad agencies called The Leadership Council on
Advertising Issues, whose stated goal is to ``preserve and enhance
the freedom to advertise.''
   ``Our study shows that reduced advertising exacts social and
economic penalties from the public,'' said Reginald Brack, the Time
Warner Inc. executive who is co-chairman of the group.
   He said the study was not prompted by any specific legislation,
although there have been periodic calls for new limits on tobacco
and liquor ads.
   An author of the report said he hoped the findings would inject
some discussion of social and economic costs into the debate over
whether to further limit advertising of tobacco, beer, wine and
liquor.

   The stock market chalked up additional gains
today amid improved investor confidence following Monday's moderate
rally.
   A partial recovery earlier in Tokyo after a key measure of the
world's biggest equities market took its second-steepest one-day
plunge ever on Monday reassured U.S. investors, analysts said.
   Spirits were lifted on Wall Street Monday when the market
managed to overcome its uneasiness about Tokyo's troubles.
   Hildegarde Zagorski, a market analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said stocks were ripe for a rebound, having been
sold heavily before this week.
   ``I think what we're seeing here is a technical rebound,'' she
said, noting that investors still are nervous about the
consequences sluggish economic growth could have on corporate
profits.
   Investors, meanwhile, were reluctant to read too much
significance into a tumble in orders to U.S. factories for durable
goods. Stocks barely budged in response to the news, market
watchers said.
   The January drop of 10.5 percent, the biggest decline since the
government began keeping track of the figures, was seen as further
evidence of a slumping manufacturing sector. However, analysts
noted the orders are volatile and often subject to large revisions.

   Negotiations between Greyhound Lines Inc. and its
bus drivers union continued Tuesday, with a news blackout extended
until midday Wednesday.
   Dallas-based Greyhound, which operates the nation's only
intercity bus system, faces a 12:01 a.m. Friday strike deadline set
by the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, which
represents 6,300 drivers and 3,075 of the company's office and
maintenance workers.
   Full scale negotiations over wage issues ceased last week, but
low-level talks resumed in Scottsdale, Ariz., Sunday, and a news
blackout was imposed until noon local time Tuesday. That deadline
was extended until noon Wednesday, company spokesman Liz Hale said.
   Citing the blackout, Ms. Hale refused to say if progress had
been made in the talks.
   The two sides went into negotiations far apart on wage issues,
with the company saying it could not afford more than its initial
$63 million offer. The company estimates the union's three-year
proposal would cost $406 million.
   Greyhound has said it will operate on a limited schedule if the
drivers go on strike, with plans to be back to full operations by
the end of March.

<HEAD>Ford's Petersen: Japanese May Move Too Fast on New Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese automakers, praised for quickly
developing new cars, are so fast in bringing out some new products
that they blur distinctions between two models of the same car,
outgoing Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald Petersen said Tuesday.
   Petersen steps down Thursday as leader of the world's
second-largest automaker, at a time that Ford and other U.S.
companies retrench operations as their market shrinks and as they
struggle to curb costs.
   One cost-saving area for U.S. automakers is to cut the time for
developing a new car and bring it to dealers. The Big Three have
been taking leads from their associations with Japanese companies
to reduce that time.
   Petersen, whose company is in ventures with Mazda Motor Corp.
and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. of Japan, said there's risk in being too
fast.
   ``The Japanese are changing their rate that isn't necessarily
doing them a lot of good. I don't think I'm abnormal in my
inability to identify one car from another,'' said Petersen, who
has worked in the industry for nearly 41 years.
   One company considered to have an exceptionally quick product
cycle time is Honda Motor Co. Ltd. Yet its 1990 Accord, which Honda
advertises as an entirely new vehicle, has been criticized for not
being distinctive enough from earlier models.
   Petersen became Ford president in 1980 at the nadir of the
company's fiscal troubles and took over as chairman and chief
executive officer on Feb. 1, 1985.
   In 1980, Ford lost $1.5 billion. Petersen led Ford out of its
slump, aided by the marketing of such popular vehicles as the
Taurus, and the company posted an industry-record $5.3 billion
profit in 1988.
   Petersen is departing as the U.S. auto industry struggles to
hold down costs in a diminishing market that is threatened more
than ever by cars made by Japanese companies overseas and in the
United States.
   Petersen said he wanted to be remembered at Ford for his work in
developing a ``no-star system.''
   ``I wanted people to have a sense of teamwork,'' he said. Since
Petersen has been chairman, and with influence from Mazda, Ford has
begun adapting a Japanese team-oriented manufacturing method.
   Ford owns 25 percent of Mazda and gets its Probe cars from
Mazda's plant in Flat Rock, Mich. Later this year, Ford will make
the Mazda Navajo sport-utility vehicles at its plant in Louisville,
Ky.
   But when asked outside of Ford which automaker he most admired,
Petersen said Toyota Motor Corp.
   ``They have a very complex product line,'' he said. ``They are a
very big company and sell in very high volume. There are others
(companies) but they are more limited in their product line.
   ``I'm extraordinarily impressed with (the West German) BMW,''
Petersen said. ``And the other company that impresses me is
(France's) Peugeot. I think their cars are beautifully designed.''
   Taking over for Petersen is Vice Chairman Harold Poling, who
will be chairman for three years. Speculation is that Executive
Vice President Alan Gilmour, who becomes president of the Ford
Automotive Group on Thursday, will succeed Poling.
   During the next 18 months, General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger
B. Smith and Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca also will step
aside.

   A federal grand jury in Alaska is considering
a five-count criminal indictment against Exxon Corp. stemming from
last spring's oil spill in Prince William Sound, a government
official said today. The information could not be confirmed.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said at
one point that an indictment had already been handed down. Later he
explained that he had spoken prematurely after reading a draft
Justice Department news release.
   David Runkel, spokesman for Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh, said
no indictment had been returned. Thornburgh scheduled a
late-afternoon news conference and aides said he was expected to
discuss the Exxon case.
   Exxon officials said they would have no immediate comment.
   It was March 24, 1989 that the Exxon Valdez released 11 million
gallons of oil in Prince William Sound, causing widespread
environmental damage in the nation's worst oil spill.

<HEAD>Delaware Supreme Court Affirms Directors Rights in
Time-Warner-Paramount Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Delaware Supreme Court, in a written
decision resulting from last year's Time-Warner-Paramount takeover
battle, on Tuesday affirmed the right of a board of directors to
determine the future course of a company.
   The ruling came seven months after the state's highest court
upheld a Chancery Court decision allowing Time Inc. to proceed with
its $14 billion takeover of Warner Communications Inc. and barring
Paramount Communications Inc. and Time stockholders from
interfering with the deal.
   The case was heard in Delaware because all three companies _
like many of the biggest U.S. corporations _ are incorporated
there, and is seen as likely to affect other future merger
proposals.
   The plaintiffs had sought to force the Time board to consider
Paramount's $12.2 billion bid, which would have given Time
stockholders $200 a share in cash.
   But, Delaware's highest court said, ``A board of directors,
while always required to act in an informed manner, is not under
any per se duty to maximize shareholder value in the short-term
even in the context of a takeover.''
   In March 1989, Time and Warner announced plans to merge in a
friendly exchange of stock. But in June, less than three weeks
before shareholders were to vote on the deal, Paramount launched a
hostile $10.7 billion bid that it later sweetened to $12.2 billion.
   Time and Warner countered by amending their plans to provide for
Time's $14 billion tender offer for Warner. In Chancery Court in
Delaware, Chancellor William T. Allen decided in favor of Time and
Warner.
   The Supreme Court sustained Allen's ruling in an oral decision
in late July, saying it would issue a written opinion in the future.
   Time and Warner completed their merger on Jan. 10.
   In his ruling, Allen gave corporate directors wider latitude in
defending against unwanted takeover bids. While affirming his
decision, the Supreme Court disagreed with his concern about
Paramount's attempt to disrupt Time's long-range plans.
   ``We think it unwise to place undue emphasis upon long-term vs.
short-term corporate strategy ... '' Justice Henry R. Horsey wrote
in an 82-page decision.
   ``Directors generally are obliged to charter a course for a
corporation which is in its best interest without regard to a fixed
investment horizon,'' Horsey said.
   Paramount and Time shareholders contended that Time essentially
put itself up for sale with its initial Warner merger agreement,
partly on grounds that Warner shareholders at that time would have
ended up holding more than 60 percent of the stock in Time Warner
Inc.
   They argued that control of Time effectively would be
transferred to the Warner shareholders and, under a 1986 Delaware
Supreme Court ruling resulting from the takeover of Revlon Inc.,
the Time board should have considered the Paramount bid.
   But the Supreme Court agreed with Allen that the Time case did
not meet the requirements of the Revlon case. Horsey cited ``the
absence of any substantial evidence to conclude that Time's board,
in negotiating with Warner, made the dissolution or breakup of the
corporate entity inevitable, as was the case in Revlon.''
   Revlon applies when a ``corporation initiates an active bidding
process, seeking to sell itself or to effect a business
reorganization involving a clear breakup of the company,'' Horsey
wrote.
   The Revlon standards also apply when, ``in response to a
bidder's offer, a target company abandons its long-term strategy
and seeks an alternative stratey also involving the breakup of the
company,'' he wrote, adding that neither of these scenarios applied
to the Time case.
   The plaintiffs also contended that Time's tender offer for
Warner put the company up for sale. But, Horsey wrote, the tender
offer was a reasonable defensive response and not an abandonment of
Time's continued existence.
   Paramount had sought to portray Time's tender offer as an
unreasonable defense aimed at forcing the Time-Warner merger onto
shareholders. The Supreme Court responded by giving directors more
leeway in deciding whether an offer poses a threat to a company,
its shareholders, workers or surrounding community.
   Horsey told the plaintiffs that a court cannot be involved in
``substituting its judgment for what is a `better' deal or that of
a corporation's board of directors.''
   He also said there was nothing to stop Paramount from pursuing
the combined Time Warner Inc.
   The case also was heard by Justices Randy J. Holland and Andrew
G.T. Moore II.

   Stock prices chalked up additional gains Tuesday
amid improved investor confidence due to the market's strong
performance in the aftermath of a rout in Tokyo.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which jumped 38.29
points on Monday, added another 14.64 to close at 2,617.12.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
927 up, 558 down and 496 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 152.59 million
shares, up slightly from 148.91 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 181.33 million shares.
   Spirits on Wall Street had gotten a lift from the market's
ability on Monday to cope calmly with Tokyo's troubles. Confidence
was bolstered again Tuesday as the market managed to maintain its
upward momentum.
   Hildegarde Zagorski, a market analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said stocks were ripe for a rebound, having been
sold heavily before this week.
   ``I think what we're seeing here is a technical rebound,'' she
said, noting that investors still are nervous about the
consequences sluggish economic growth could have on corporate
profits.
   A partial recovery earlier Tuesday in Tokyo after a key measure
of the world's biggest equities market took its second-steepest
one-day plunge ever on Monday also reassured U.S. investors.
   Investors, meanwhile, were reluctant to read too much
significance into a tumble in orders to U.S. factories for durable
goods. Stocks barely budged in response to the government report,
market watchers said.
   The January drop of 10.5 percent, the biggest decline in 32
years of recordkeeping, was seen as further evidence of a weak
manufacturing sector. However, analysts noted the orders are
volatile and often subject to large revisions.
   American Express led the Big Board's list of actively traded
stocks, slumping | to 28&lsqb; as more than 3.4 million shares changed
hands. The selloff came after news that American Express will pump
an additional $750 million into its Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings
unit after making a $250 million infusion in December.
   Pfizer regained 3&lsqb; to 59&lsqb; after running up losses Monday as a
Congressional subcommittee began hearings on defective heart valves
formerly manufactured by the company's Shiley unit. Securites
analysts noted the panel didn't recommend a criminal investigation
into Shiley.
   Among the active blue chips, International Business Machines
lost \ to 103}, General Motors moved ahead by { to 45, American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph added { to 39|, General Electic was up } at
62 and Philip Morris fell &lsqb; to 37|.
   AMR, parent of American Airlines, gained altitude due to a
favorable assessment by a Wall Street analyst. It rose 1 to 59{.
Among other airline stocks, UAL, owner of United, jumped 2 to 128{.
   Several retail stocks had a strong day. Wal-Mart, which reported
a 32 percent surge in fourth-quarter income, jumped 1&rsqb; to 43\.
Woolworth, which posted a 22 percent pickup in its fourth-quarter
profit, rose } to 59&rsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $15.61 billion, or 0.49
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks ended
0.90 higher at 182.16.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.91 to 380.42, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index went up 1.59 to 330.26.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.66 to 422.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 351.40, up 1.04.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Prices Slip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices fell Tuesday as a bid to
extend the previous session's rally faltered late in the day.
   Analysts attributed the pullback to expectations that oil and
unleaded gasoline inventories are growing, a recognition that
prices of the benchmark grade of U.S. crude are high relative to
those available on comparable grades overseas and to profit-taking
following Monday's rally.
   The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the key grade of
U.S. crude oil, lost 21 cents to close at $21.58 a 42-gallon barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange after rising 37 cents a barrel
on Monday. Later contracts also finished lower on Tuesday.
   Refined products traded on the New York Merc also fell.
   Unleaded regular gasoline for delivery in March, which slipped
0.02 cent a gallon Monday, dropped 2.27 cents to 57.56 cents a
gallon. Later contracts had smaller losses.
   No. 2 heating oil for March delivery fell 0.89 cent a gallon,
after rising 0.75 cent on Monday. Later contracts were down by
smaller amounts.
   Tom Bentz, director of futures trading at United Energy Inc.,
said prices moved higher early in the session in an extension of
Monday's move.
   But he said prices headed lower late in the session, led by
unleaded gasoline prices.
   He said gasoline prices have been under pressure for several
weeks because refiners have been building stocks at a time when
demand is seasonally sluggish. He said stocks of unleaded gasoline
are about 20 million gallons higher than they were a year ago.
   James Steel, energy analyst at the brokerage company Refco Inc.,
said gasoline stocks are ``more than adequate for this time of
year.''
   Steel said Tuesday's decline also reflected traders' realization
that ``there was no firm fundamental reason for the market rising
on Monday.''
   He said West Texas Intermediate crude is also being viewed as
overvalued relative to comparable grades of crude oil from the
North Sea.

<HEAD>Gasoline Futures Plunge On Supply Perceptions, Technical Weakness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline futures prices were pummeled Tuesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in a sell-off linked to perceptions of ample
near-term supplies and strongly bearish chart signals.
   Other petroleum futures also retreated.
   On other commodity markets, silver futures led the precious
metals lower; pork bellies were down the daily limit while cattle
futures advanced; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Unleaded gasoline futures settled .80 cent to 2.27 cents lower
with the contract for delivery in March down 2.27 cents at 57.56
cents a gallon.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 18 cents to 41 cents
lower with April at $21.58 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent to
.89 cent lower with March at 58.16 cents a gallon.
   Energy futures were weak for much of the session amid
perceptions of ample supplies of gasoline along the Gulf Coast and
in the New York harbor, analysts said.
   Further selling stemmed from expectations the American Petroleum
Institute would show a substantial increase in U.S. inventories of
gasoline for the seventh week in a row, and from position-evening
ahead of the expiration Wednesday of the March petroleum contracts.
   But the heaviest selling occurred late in the session after the
March gasoline contract dropped below 59 cents a gallon, triggering
waves of sell orders based purely on chart signals.
   ``When it got pushed down to the point where the technicals
kicked in, then it was just a bloodbath,'' said Jerry Samuels, an
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   The weekly API inventory report, released after the close of
trading, showed a 2.5-million-barrel rise in gasoline stocks last
week, which was within market expectations.
   Crude oil inventories fell by a moderately surprising 2.9
million barrels, and U.S. supplies of petroleum distillates,
including heating oil, fell 2.3 million barrels, a
larger-than-expected drop.
   Silver futures fell to a 4{-month low on New York's Commodity
Exchange but other precious metals posted only slight declines
after steep losses Monday.
   Silver's weakness stemmed in part from the government's report
of a record-large, 10.5 percent drop last month in orders to U.S.
factories for durable goods, ``indicating again that the economy is
not as strong as I think the Fed would like us to believe,'' said
Anne Orton, a vice president of precious-metals dealer Deak
International Inc.
   Silver, as an industrial metal, would suffer a greater drop in
demand than gold or platinum in an economic slowdown, she said.
   Silver futures finished 7 cents to 7.3 cents lower with March at
$5.075 a troy ounce, the lowest settlement of a silver futures
contract in New York since Oct. 9.
   Gold futures finished 80 cents to $1.10 lower on the Comex with
March at $408 a troy ounce.
   Platinum futures finished $1.30 to $1.80 lower on the New York
Merc with April at $509.80 a troy ounce.,
   Most frozen pork belly futures plunged the permitted
2-cents-a-pound daily limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in a
technically inspired sell-off that erased nearly half of last
week's gains.
   Hog futures weakened on spillover selling from the belly pit
while cattle futures ended mostly higher on expectations for firmer
cash markets.
   Live cattle futures settled .10 cent lower to .40 cent higher
with April at 75.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent
lower to .25 cent higher with March at 80 cents a pound; live hogs
were .27 cent lower to .10 cent higher with April at 49.82 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.9 cents to 2 cents lower with
March at 51.27 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed narrowly mixed on the
Chicago Board of Trade with the March wheat contract posting its
first daily decline in a week.
   Wheat futures settled 2{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with March
down 2 cents at $3.94\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1{ cents lower
with March at $2.45 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent lower
with March at $1.36{ a bushel; soybeans were 1\ cents lower to 1
cent higher with March at $5.61{ a bushel.

<HEAD>Creditors Still Waiting to See New Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The holding company seeing Federated
Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. through Chapter 11
reorganizations wants to seek U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval for a
plan to retain executives.
   Carol Sanger, a spokeswoman for Federated Stores Inc., holding
company for the U.S. retailing operations of Toronto-based Campeau
Corp., said Tuesday the proposal _ designed to keep executives from
leaving to join rival retailers _ is still being developed.
   It would apply to ranks from senior management all the way down
to middle-level executives in merchandising and similar jobs within
the Federated and Allied store groups, Ms. Sanger said.
   She said the proposal may not be ready to be submitted at the
next hearing scheduled March 15 before Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr.,
who is overseeing the Federated and Allied bankruptcy cases and
must approve expenditures. But the proposal could be added to the
agenda if it is completed.
   ``There's still plenty of time to add things to the calendar,''
Ms. Sanger said.
   She said the plan will consist of ``various performance and
retention incentives and a reaffirmation of contracts and other
benefits.'' She declined to be specific about whether salary
increases or improved benefits might be offered.
   Lewis Rosenbloom, a lawyer for Federated's unsecured creditors,
including major merchandise suppliers and factoring companies that
serve as middlemen between suppliers and stores, said Federated has
not made any details of its proposal available to the creditors. He
said he did not know enough about the proposal to say whether the
creditors would support it.
   ``We are told that the plan will be disclosed March 1 at a
meeting in New York. It'll be the first opportunity we have to look
at it,'' Rosenbloom said. ``I am aware of it. We have no details
whatsoever.''
   Rosenbloom said the creditors recognize the need to provide
incentives designed to retain key managers from leaving to join
other firms during the Chapter 11 reorganization. But he said the
creditors would want part of the managers' compensation and
benefits tied to emergence of Federated and Allied from Chapter 11
and to the ultimate dividend payable to unsecured creditors.
   Federated and Allied, both based in Cincinnati, filed their
Chapter 11 petitions Jan. 15, listing a total of $7.7 billion in
debts. The companies were saddled with the debt when Campeau
purchased them in 1986 and 1988.
   The companies are developing reorganization plans while under
Bankruptcy Court protection from creditors.

   B. Dalton Bookseller on Tuesday said it plans a
chainwide launch of a discount program aimed at regular book buyers.
   The announcement came a day after one of B. Dalton's major
competitors, Waldenbooks, unveiled a new ``Preferred Reader''
program, which rewards frequent buyers with discounts and extra
services.
   The B. Dalton ``Booksavers Club,'' which begins March 5, is
similar to the Waldenbooks program. The company said in a news
release it had launched the Booksavers Club in Dallas in 1988 and
now would be offering it at all of its 800 stores around the
country.
   Members in the B. Dalton club will be able to purchase
membership cards for $10 entitling them to receive 10 percent
discounts on all books bought for a year. A special $5 introductory
price will be available during March.
   ``The `Booksavers Club' program will be supported by a mailing
of specially produced custom catalogs to participating members,''
said Leonard Riggio, president and chief executive officer of the
B. Dalton division of B.D.B. Inc.
   Riggio said in a news release the chain will be offering other
in-store programs in the spring.
   Waldenbooks, owned by K mart Corp., said its program will start
Friday. Among other elements, Waldenbooks also will offer 10
percent discounts to participants enrolling for $10 a year into the
``Preferred Reader'' program.

   Levi Strauss Associates Inc., reporting
results for the first time since going private in 1985, said
Tuesday its profits rose nearly fivefold in its fourth quarter and
more than doubled for its latest fiscal year as annual sales
climbed to $3.6 billion.
   The parent company of Levi Strauss &amp; Co., the world's largest
brand-name clothing manufacturer, disclosed its results as it began
issuing stock to employees.
   Levi Strauss said it earned $49.8 million in the fourth quarter
on sales of $960 million for 1989, vs. $10.3 million on sales of
$821.9 million for 1988.
   For the fiscal year ended last Nov. 26, the company's net income
rose to $272.3 million from $111.9 million the year before.
   The 1989 income exceeds the record earnings of $223.7 million
reported by the company's publicly held predecessor in 1980.
   Sales of $3.6 billion, which increased for the third straight
year, rose 16 percent over $3.1 billion in 1988.
   Ninety percent of the company's stock is owned by about 100
shareholders, mostly from the Haas family, who took the company
private.
   The company is beginning a stock savings plan in which it will
match 50 percent of employees' savings. Levi Strauss said it
expects employees to own up to 10 percent of the stock within five
years. The company employs 31,000 worldwide.
   The company attributed its strong performance to higher margins
on increased sales, the sale of a minority interest in the
company's Japanese subsidiary and a lower effective tax rate. The
pre-tax gain on the sale of the Japanese subsidiary's stock was
$71.8 million.
   International sales increased 22 percent to $1.2 billion in 1989
and accounted for one-third of Levi's business. Domestic sales
increased 14 percent to $2.4 billion.
   ``The year's results were achieved during a time of significant
changes in the retail industry,'' said Robert D. Haas, chairman and
chief executive officer. ``They reflect our success in focusing on
our core jeans, jeans-related products and casual wear.''
   A big reason for the booming sales was the success of the
Dockers line of casual clothes, introduced in late 1986 and
designed for aging baby boomers who have outgrown jeans. The total
Dockers wear _ for men, women and, now, children _ accounted for
nearly $400 million in sales in 1989, more than triple the $118
million of the year before.
   The company also said it had repaid most of the $1.6 billion
debt from its leveraged buyout five years ago. It said it reduced
its debt to $475 million.
   ``We feel we've been one of the most successful (leveraged
buyouts),'' said George B. James, senior vice president and chief
financial officer, who noted the company is seven years ahead of
schedule on repayment of its buyout debt.
   ``Last year all our businesses were setting records. It was one
of those years when nothing dragged us down, a satisfying, vintage
year,'' he said. ``It was a good year to start our public
reporting.''

   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, reaching an eight-month high despite intervention by
central banks, while closing mixed against other currencies.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid for gold at $408.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down 25
cents from late Monday.
   Thomas Palladino, a trader with Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New
York, said the Federal Reserve sold dollars in New York an attempt
to drive down the currency's value against the yen when the dollar
reached the 148.80 to 148.85 yen level.
   He said the intervention appeared to have little effect.
   Earlier, the Bank of Japan tried to stem the dollar's rise
against the yen in the Tokyo market. On Monday, both central banks
likewise sold dollars, but the currency reached an eight-month high
against the yen despite the intervention.
   The dollar rose Tuesday to 148.73 yen in late trading in New
York. The dollar has not closed that high against the yen since
June 15, when it reached 151.30 yen.
   Traders said U.S. currency softened a bit in the morning after
the Commerce Department reported that orders to U.S. factories for
durable goods plunged 10.5 percent in January, the biggest decline
since orders first were tracked 32 years ago.
   But the dollar soon regained its strength, Palladino said.
   ``It really was a nothing trading day,'' said Bob Morrissey, a
trader for Bank of Boston.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 149.03 yen from 148.65
yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it slipped to 148.57 yen.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound. In London, the
pound traded at $1.6915 late Tuesday, cheaper than $1.6927 late
Monday. In New York, the pound cost $1.6908, more than the $1.6903
of late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.6880 West German marks, down marginally from
1.6882; 1.4840 Swiss francs, down from 1.4860; 5.7150 French
francs, up from 5.7140; 1,248.75 Italian lire, up from 1,248.50;
and 1.1938 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19405.
   Late rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's prices,

   Eastern Airlines has asked the federal
bankruptcy court to release $60 million from escrow to help finance
its operations in March, as the airlines continues attempting to
reorganize as a smaller carrier.
   Eastern filed a request for the funds with U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in New York on Monday, company spokesman Robin Matell said Tuesday
from Eastern's headquarters in Miami.
   A hearing on the matter was scheduled for Thursday, the same day
court-appointed bankruptcy examiner David I. Shapiro is due to
report to the court on his months-long investigation of Eastern and
its finances.
   A committee representing Eastern's unsecured creditors, mainly
equipment suppliers such as aircraft and engine makers, supported
the airline's request.
   Attorneys for the Air Line Pilots Association and the striking
Machinists union opposed the request, as they had Eastern's earlier
petitions for cash. The union lawyers have asked that every dollar
withdrawn by Eastern be matched by a contribution from its parent,
Texas Air Corp.
   Eastern is asking that $60 million be taken out of escrow funds,
which contain around $550 million raised from separate sales of
Eastern assets since the airline filed for bankruptcy court
protection last March 9.
   A month ago, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland approved
Eastern's request for $50 million to finance operations through the
end of February. That ruling was the fourth time Lifland had
approved an Eastern request for funds, bringing to $260 million the
total withdrawn from escrow so far.
   Last week, Eastern reached agreement with the unsecured
creditors on a new reorganization plan under which sister carrier
Continental Airlines would make some payments to the creditors.
   The unsecured creditors, who are owed $980 million by Eastern,
would receive about $490 million in cash and notes under the plan.
If the bankruptcy court approves the plan, Eastern says it could
emerge from Chapter 11 this summer.
   Eastern and Continental are subsidiaries of Houston-based Texas
Air, the nation's largest airline company. Eastern's previous
reorganization proposals did not involve the assistance of
Continental or Texas Air.
   Eastern still has not reached agreement with holders of its
preferred shares, who are owed about $1 billion. The preferred
holders objected to Eastern's earlier plan, which would have paid
them only 10 cents on the dollar, and called for the liquidation or
sale of the airline.
   The airline's exclusive right to file a reorganization plan
expired last Tuesday.
   The Machinists union is continuing the strike it began against
Eastern last March 4. Eastern's pilots and flight attendants'
unions called off their sympathy walkouts last November, but the
airline had replaced the strikers mainly with non-union workers as
it rebuilt from the strike.

   The price of McClatchy Newspapers Inc.'s
publicly-traded common stock jumped sharply Tuesday in heavier than
normal activity.
   McClatchy Class A common stock surged $3 to $24.50 a share on
the New York Stock Exchange on volume of 46,900 shares, compared
with average daily volume of about 12,600 shares.
   Asked if there was any explanation for the activity, Elaine
Lintecum, corporate financial analyst for McClatchy, said it was
the company's policy not to comment on trading activity in its
shares.
   On Feb. 20, the company made a similar statement in response to
an inquiry from the NYSE about that day's trading activity. On that
day, the Class A stock rose $2.25 to $21.62{ a share on volume of
62,800 shares.
   McClatchy, which is based in Sacramento, Calif., has two classes
of stock.
   Its Class A shares each carry one-tenth of a vote and elect as a
group 25 percent of the McClatchy board. As of Dec. 31, there were
4.3 million Class A shares outstanding.
   The company also has 25 million shares of Class B stock, which
are not publicly traded and are controlled or held for the benefit
of the McClatchy family. Each Class B share has a single vote and
the Class B shares as a group elect 75 percent of the board.
   The company owns 11 daily and eight non-daily newspapers,
including The Sacramento Bee, The Fresno Bee and the Anchorage
Daily News.
   In 1989, the company earned $33.9 million, or $1.19 a share, on
revenue of $380.8 million, up from a profit of $28.8 million, or
$1.02 a share, on revenue of $355.8 million in 1988.

   The Justice Department announced a five-count
criminal indictment against Exxon Corp. and its shipping subsidiary
Tuesday night in the Exxon Valdez oil spill that fouled Alaska's
coast nearly a year ago.
   Officials said that if the giant oil company is convicted on all
counts brought by a federal grand jury in Anchorage it could face
criminal fines of as much as $1.6 million.
   In addition, the government could seek as much as $700 million
more in penalties under a separate federal statute that allows
recovery of twice the amount of proven losses caused by the spill,
the worst in the nation's history, the officials said.
   In New York, Exxon chairman Lawrence G. Rawl said in a
statement, ``We will defend ourselves in court against these
charges. We believe there is no statutory basis for the amount of
the fines mentioned by the U.S. attorney general.''
   Rawl called the grounding ``a tragic accident for which both
corporations have apologized to the American people, especially the
people of Alaska. Nobody willfully grounded the ship or caused the
spill.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh told a news conference that the
indictment was presented to the grand jury after a proposed plea
deal fell through. State officials had strenuously objected to one
proposed agreement.
   The Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound on March
24, 1989, and spilled more than 11 million gallons of crude into
the pristine waters, polluting hundreds of miles of Alaska coastal
waters and shoreline.
   Exxon has spent more than $2 billion in cleanup efforts, but
environmentalists argue that the job is far from complete and the
total damages to natural resources may not be known for years.
   Assistant Attorney General Dick Stewart said the grand jury
indictment accused Exxon Corp. and its shipping subsidiary of two
felonies and three misdemeanors.
   The felonies, each of which carries a maximum fine of $500,000,
accuse the company of violating the Port and Waterways Safety Act
and the Dangerous Cargo Act.
   The latter charge alleges that Exxon ``willfully and knowingly
violated a regulation prohibiting any person from being engaged on
a crew if such person is known to be physically or mentally
incapable of'' performing his or her duties.
   Joseph Hazelwood, captain of the Exxon Valdez, faces criminal
charges in a separate action in Alaska, and is accused of being
drunk and letting his ship get away from him.
   The three misdemeanor counts accuse Exxon of:
   _Violating the Clean Water Act by illegally discharging
pollutants into Prince William Sound.
   _Unlawfully discharging refuse, the oil.
   _Violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a count which stems
from the deaths of more than 36,000 birds as a result of oil
pollution.
   Each of the misdemeanor counts carries a maximum penalty of
$200,000, the Justice officials said.
   Thornburgh said, ``This indictment does not in any way affect
the civil remedies that are available to the United States or the
civil remedies that are available to the state of Alaska or private
parties.''
   Civil suits have been filed by a number of environmental groups
and the state.
   As for a plea bargain, Thornburgh said, ``We were approached by
the prospective defendants, now defendants. ... The terms that we
insisted upon were not acceptable to the defendants. Therefore, we
presented the case to a grand jury.''
   The plea bargain discussions resulted in sharp exchanges between
Alaska state officials and the Justice Department in recent weeks.
   In a letter to Justice last weekend, Alaska Attorney General
Doug Baily accused the department of trying to force the state into
signing off on an agreement by threatening to withhold continued
federal involvement in joint federal-state efforts to assess
damages from the spill.
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper and Baily expressed concern that the
plea bargaining might handcuff state officials pursuing further
civil actions against Exxon to recoup damages.
   After reviewing a draft agreement with Exxon last week, the
state officials refused to go along with it largely because, they
said, it would have hampered the state's ability to obtain funds
from Exxon to restore natural resources damaged by the spill.
   State officials questioned whether Exxon would have had to pay
adequate money into a state-run resource restoration fund. They
also maintained that some provisions of the proposed plea
bargaining agreement might hamper civil suits.

   Three disciplinary actions linked to alleged
trading violations were announced by the Chicago Board of Trade and
its affiliate, the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange.
   Matthew Daen, a principal of AM Investors, was suspended from
membership priviledges for 10 days and fined $15,000. He was
accused of conduct ``inconsistent with just and equitable
principles and trade'' and with other violations.
   AM Investors was fined $10,000 based on the incidents involving
Daen.
   Lawrence Pfeifer, a former floor clerk for AM Investors, was
denied floor access privileges for 10 days and fined $5,000. He was
accused of dishonest conduct and other alleged violations.
   Pfeifer declined to comment when reached at his home. Calls late
Tuesday to AM Investors went unanswered and no telephone listing
was available for Daen.

   The Justice Department announced a five-count
criminal indictment against Exxon Corp. and its shipping subsidiary
Tuesday night in the Exxon Valdez oil spill that fouled Alaska's
coast nearly a year ago.
   ``The indictment returned today represents our best shot at
prosecuting this incident,'' Atorney General Dick Thornburgh said.
   Noting that a reporter had said the indictment ``throws the
environmental book at Exxon,'' Thornburgh said, ``Without endorsing
that characterization, it has some poetry to it anyway.''
   Officials said that if the giant oil company is convicted on all
counts brought by a federal grand jury in Anchorage it could face
criminal fines of as much as $1.6 million.
   In addition, the government could seek as much as $700 million
more in penalties under a separate federal statute that allows
recovery of twice the amount of proven losses caused by the spill,
the worst in the nation's history, the officials said.
   When those damages have been calculated, the department will
bring civil suits against the company, Thornburgh said.
   In New York, Exxon chairman Lawrence G. Rawl said in a
statement, ``We will defend ourselves in court against these
charges. We believe there is no statutory basis for the amount of
the fines mentioned by the U.S. attorney general.''
   Rawl called the grounding ``a tragic accident for which both

   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper and Baily expressed concern that the
plea bargaining might handcuff state officials pursuing further
civil actions against Exxon to recoup damages.
   In comments telephoned to reporters in Juneau from Washington
after the indictment was announced, the governor was much gentler
with the Justice Department.
   ``I want to make it clear that I never thought the Justice
Department was proceeding in bad faith. I don't think that they
meant to harm us in any way,'' Cowper said.
   ``In fairness to Justice, they were in a box here. They were not
able to give us the full story because the law prohibits them from
disclosing what's going on in a criminal action before an
indictment.''
   Though Thornburgh was upset with the state's public criticism,
Cowper said, ``We felt we had to defend our position.''
   Cowper said he would withhold comment on the indictment until he
could read it.
   After reviewing a draft agreement with Exxon last week, the
state officials refused to go along with it largely because, they
said, it would have hampered the state's ability to obtain funds

   Northrop Corp. pleaded guilty Tuesday to 34
federal counts related to falsified testing of parts for the AV-8B
Harrier jet and cruise missile components and agreed to pay a $17
million fine.
   The defense contractor, which builds the B-2 bomber, entered the
pleas on charges of making false statements to the government
through attorney Richard Sauber.
   The company said in a statement that the government had agreed
to drop 141 other counts as part of the agreement.
   Prosecutors said charges would be dropped against Joseph Yamron,
62, vice president and general manager of Northrop's Norwood,
Mass.-based Precision Products Division, and Leopold Engler, 60,
vice president of instrument operations there.
   The two men, who have been on administrative leave to prepare
their defense, will return to their former duties, Northrop said.
   ``As part of the compromise the government and Northrop have
resolved a number of other pending investigations the government
has been conducting,'' Northrop said in its statement.
   The company asserted that, according to the military services
that use the Harrier and the cruise missile, ``both systems have
performed satisfactorily in flight operations.''
   Earlier Tuesday, a former Northrop Corp. plant manager pleaded
guilty in federal court to charges of falsifying test data on
components of cruise missile guidance systems.
   Charles Gonsalves entered the plea under an agreement with
prosecutors in which he would be sentenced to no more than three
years in prison and be fined a maximum of $1.2 million.
   Gonsalves, once supervisor of Northrop's Western Services
Department, pleaded guilty to one conspiracy count and seven counts
of making false statements to the government from 1984 to 1987.
   Sentencing was set for May 1 before U.S. District Judge Pamela
Ann Rymer.
   Gonsalves entered his plea as a jury was about to hear the case
against him, quality assurance supervisor Cheryl Hannan and
Northrop on charges related to the Harrier parts.
   Prosecutors agreed to a diversion program for Hannan, who was
charged in both the Harrier and missile aspects of the case, and
charges will be dropped if she completes the program to the
satisfaction of probation officials.
   Howard Hyde, chief engineer at Western Services, pleaded guilty
last May to charges involving falsifying tests on the jet parts.
   The April 1989 indictment charged that the company and the five
current and former employees conspired between the 1970s and 1989
to install parts for the cruise missile's flight data transmitter
that failed to meet government specifications.
   It also said the transmitter required extensive reliability
testing that was not performed. Instead, the indictment said, three
of the defendants supervised false testing and falsification of
test results.
   Concerning the Harrier jet program, the indictment accused the
defendants of failing between 1981 and 1986 to conduct vibration
tests of the jet's rate sensor assemblies at levels required by
contract. The assemblies are part of the flight stabilization
system of the attack jet.
   The company said it first discovered and disclosed to the
government and the public in July 1987 that some of the 30
employees at the Western Services Department had ``admitted failing
to perform certain tests on electronic equipment.''
   The plant manager and three of his employees were dismissed. The
plant was closed quickly and its functions transferred to Precision
Products, Northrop said.
