<HEAD>Secretary of State Baker Meets ANC Activist, Tours Soweto</HEAD>

   U.S. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III toured this huge black township Friday and decried the
contrast with the wealth of the country's whites.
   He said the comparison is ``quite distressing, and that's why I
said the system of apartheid should be abolished as soon as
possible.''
   A day after giving South Africa's white minority government a
pat on the back, Baker met with anti-apartheid activist Walter
Sisulu at his home here in a neighborhood of small, brick houses
near Johannesburg, Africa's wealthiest city. Sisulu is a leader of
the African National Congress, the leading anti-apartheid group.
   The secretary also visited community centers, a day-care center
across the street from Sisulu's house, and drove past a squatter
camp that has risen up on an old golf course.
   Later Friday, Baker flew to Kinshasa, Zaire, for meetings with
President Mobutu Sese Seko and Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas
Savimbi. Baker already has met President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of
Angola as part of U.S. efforts to negotiate an end to the civil war
in that country.
   Moments before Baker arrived at Sisulu's home, some children,
perched on a jungle gym, shouted ANC slogans and sang songs
honoring ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela. But Baker didn't see
or hear the children, and when he visited their day-care center a
Baker aide lined them up to shake hands with him.
   Sisulu said, ``I told the secretary of state we are very
grateful to the people of America for the support they gave us over
the years and that we are hopeful but we are only making a
beginning and we will expect more support as the day goes by.'' He
said the talks had been ``very fruitful.''
   The ANC openly opposed Baker's meeting on Thursday with
President F.W. de Klerk, but the subject wasn't mentioned Friday
until reporters pressed.
   Sisulu said, ``The United States realizes no fundamental change
has been made but that some encouragement should be made.''
   The ANC position had been that the Baker visit, the first by a
U.S. secretary of state in 12 years, would suggest de Klerk has
made fundamental reforms of the apartheid system of racial
segregation and white domination.
   Despite this difference, ANC leaders greeted Baker warmly at
meetings in Soweto, Cape Town, and Windhoek, Namibia, where he
attended independence celebrations.
   Sisulu said de Klerk has not yet met the ANC's conditions for
negotiations, though the two sides are to hold preliminary talks
April 11.

Brady-Hashimoto meeting in Los Angeles</NOTE>

   Negotiators on Friday reported the first
breakthrough in a host of contentious trade disputes with Japan _
an agreement designed to open the Japanese market to American-made
supercomputers.
   Officials at the U.S. trade office said they had achieved major
concessions that should boost supercomputer sales in the important
Japanese government market, estimated to total about $130 million
annually.
   Terms of the agreement were hammered out late Thursday following
a two-day bargaining session. The U.S. side had demanded that the
Japanese remove various restrictions that effectively barred U.S.
companies from selling supercomputers to Japanese universities and
other government agencies.
   ``We believe the results reached last night, when finalized,
should give us full and effective access'' to the Japanese
government market, said U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
   The accord reached on supercomputers marked the first resolution
of a variety of trade disputes straining relations between the two
economic giants. It gave U.S. officials hope that progress will be
made in other areas in coming weeks.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, in Los Angeles for talks with
Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, said the agreement
showed ``we can make some progress.''
   ``Are they (supercomputer concessions) all we want? No. Are we
going to get more? Yes. When, I can't say. I hope soon,'' Brady
said.
   Brady called the session ``just a meeting to talk.'' Asked about
a report that Japan might issue bonds denominated in dollars to
support the sagging yen, Brady said, `The matter never came up.''
   The discussions were a followup to a hastily arranged summit
meeting earlier this month between President Bush and Japanese
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   Bush pressed the Japanese government to do more to open their
markets to U.S. products as a way of reducing America's $49 billion
trade deficit with Japan, accounting for almost half of the U.S.
deficit.
   A U.S. trade official said the Japanese exhibited a new sense of
urgency in the latest round of computer talks this week.
   ``Their negotiators came with instructions to make a deal. There
has been a lot of high-level political pressure,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition that his name not be used. ``We
hope the Japanese will perceive the same kind of guidance in the
other issues.''
   In addition to supercomputers, the administration is holding
talks on Japanese purchases of satellites and lumber products.
Negotiators in these areas, however, have reported little progress
thus far.
   The Japanese are facing a June 19 deadline to show a willingness
to open their markets or face the prospect that the administration
will retaliate by raising tariffs on Japanese products sold in
America.
   Members of Congress said the supercomputer agreement, which
could be signed formally as soon as next month, was encouraging but
would need to be followed by concrete results.
   ``Japan must recognize that promises without performance are
simply unacceptable,'' said Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., noted that a 1987 agreement by the
Japanese to buy more American supercomputers had not produced
results. He said it would be a mistake for U.S. negotiators to
declare victory too soon.
   ``Nonetheless, progress is always encouraging. I hope this is a
sign that the United States and Japan can jointly work out their
trade frictions,'' said Baucus, who is chairman of the Senate trade
subcommittee.
   The talks on specific industries are being conducted under a
section of the 1988 trade law known as Super 301. The
administration also is conducting separate discussions aimed at
eliminating broader structural impediments to trade that make it
difficult for U.S. firms to get their products to Japanese
consumers.
   Negotiators on these issues met at a remote hideaway in the
Virginia countryside earlier this week in advance of more formal
discussions in Washington on April 2 and 3. However, U.S. officials
said the discussions near Warrenton, Va., had failed to make any
progress.
   But there have been reports from Tokyo that Kaifu is preparing
an array of trade concessions in these areas in an effort to dampen
growing protectionist sentiment in Congress.
   Under the computer agreement announced Friday, the Japanese
promised to open the procurement process for supercomputers to
foreign firms and to base government purchase decisions on quality
as well as price.
   Access to the government supercomputer market has long been a
point of contention between the two countries.
   U.S. firms, in particular Cray Research Inc., have dominated the
global market for the sophisticated machines but have been unable
to sell their products to the Japanese government.
   Dennis McGrath, a spokesman for the Minneapolis-based Cray, said
his company would withhold comment until it reviews the agreement's
details.
   ``We hope this is more than just a process thing, but something
that will translate into sales in the marketplace,'' McGrath said.

   It was to be a videotape of Robert and Christine
Petitti's best day: the joyful tolling of wedding bells, the solemn
exchange of vows, a close-up of the maid of honor. But her face,
not her derriere.
   Newlywed Petitti and his wife are vexed over a videotape he says
is a cross between Fellini and ``America's Funniest Home Videos.''
The suburban chemist sued Fred Fox Studios Ltd., and settled
Wednesday for an undisclosed sum.
   A gag order prevented both sides from talking Thursday about the
tape of the May wedding. But Fox has said he stands by his
company's work, and what's more, it's the first time the family
business, set up by his father in 1919, has been sued.
   Wedding videomakers be warned: As more and more weddings go
video, so grow the hazards.
   ``People really get bent out of shape on this stuff,'' said Paul
Seitz, whose Arlington Heights company, Design Videotaping, filmed
more than 100 weddings last year.
   ``It is a very emotional day _ probably the most emotional day
of anyone's life,'' Seitz said. ``You can't explain to them there
are certain things that we just can't do. They are so used to
seeing TV and movies where it looks like magic. Real life
situations aren't like that.''
   One bride, he recalled, was upset because the doors at the back
of the church were left open during the ceremony, and appear that
way in the film.
   ``She felt that was our responsibility, but we're already
rolling the cameras as she walks down the aisle. What are we
supposed to do, put the cameras down and close the doors?''
   Seitz said good camera operators know when to film, and when not
to. Capturing a wedding fist fight for posterity is a no-no, as is
including footage of guests fainting at a hot summer wedding.
   ``You kind of make sure the camera moves away when the
bridesmaids start to sway,'' he said.
   Petitti, 37, has said Fred Fox Studios was lax on precautions.
In fact, he said, the tape of his wedding is not to be believed.
   Superimposed titles on the film provide the wrong name of the
church, he complained. The cameraman caught only the last three
seconds of the processional, Petitti said. The angle is such that
Petitti's 27-year-old bride, the former Christine Beauchamp, can
barely be seen during the ceremony, he said.
   ``You get the back of my bald head saying the vows,'' Petitti
said.
   Then there's what Petitti described as ``a blatant advertisement
in the middle of my wedding tape'' _ a camera shot of an easel
holding a sign for Fred Fox Studios.
   Worst of all, he said, was the tendency of the cameraman to
focus on the guests' posteriors while filming the dancers. Those
shots, since replayed several times to guests, have gotten
less-than-favorable reactions.
   ``Twenty years from now, I won't know whose rear ends those
are,'' Petitti moaned.

   Through half a century of international
oblivion, Lithuania has maintained a diplomatic presence in the
United States through a legation headquartered about 15 blocks up
the street from the Soviet Embassy.
   The legation is headed by Dr. Stasys Lozoraitis Jr., the son of
the man who took up the lonely post of keeping alive the diplomatic
flame of a nation that ceased to exist independently.
   It is here that the Lithuanian parliament voted Friday to
transfer its power in the event of an emergency. There was no
asnwer at the legation Friday night, and there is no telephone
listed in the Washington area for Lozoraitis.
   In a profile of the legation this month, The Wall Street Journal
quoted a message Lithuania's last foreign minister sent to his
diplomats 50 years ago: ``If catastrophe strikes, please consider
Stasys Lozoraitis chief of our nation's diplomatic corps.''
   The senior Lozoraitis held that post until he died four years
ago at 88.
   On top of having to function in a world that extends it no
formal diplomatic recognition, the Lithuanian legation has had to
pay its bills without a government to bankroll the operation. This
has been done from the gold reserves transferred out of Lithuania
to Sweden when the Soviet Union took over in 1940, the Journal
reported.

   An Air Force captain flying a classified
mission dipped his Boeing 707 to 1,500 feet and buzzed his old
neighborhood to say hello to mom. The Air Force was not amused.
   Capt. Grant Phifer said Thursday he flew for about 15 minutes at
1,500 feet while on a coast-to-coast trip Wednesday so that he
could see Pine Bluff High School, the town's airport and his
mother's house.
   ``(The) main reason I did it is because of my mom being there
and with me over 2,500 miles away, the flight was the closest she
can come to seeing me,'' Phifer told the Pine Bluff Commercial in a
telephone interview from California.
   Sgt. Jim Harper, a public information officer at Little Rock Air
Force Base, said Phifer's flight from Andrews Air Force Base, Md.,
to McClellan Air Force Base at Sacramento, Calif., was dangerous
and under investigation by personnel at McClellan.
   ``He knows better, especially at that level,'' Harper said.
``Any pilot is risking revocation of his license and possible jail
time by doing what he did.''
   The Air Force said it was looking into the matter. But Phifer
said his conscience is clear.
   ``I violated no Air Force regulations and I wouldn't have done
it if I was,'' he said.

<HEAD>Reagan, During Fund-Raising Trip to Boston, Comments on
Iran-Contra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan says he can't remember
details of the Iran-Contra affair because he met with so many
people during his eight years in office.
   In Boston on Thursday to raise money for a cancer institute,
Reagan said his meetings with more than 400 heads of state
contributed to his memory lapses in his videotaped testimony in the
Iran-Contra trial of John Poindexter.
   ``I had to say `I don't remember' so many times,'' Reagan told
reporters. ``How do you go back and remember who you met on a
certain day?''
   Responding to the trial judge's ruling Thursday that he did not
have to turn over parts of his personal diaries as evidence, Reagan
said taking away the tradition of executive privilege might
``invade'' the presidency.
   Lawyers for Poindexter, the former national security adviser,
had argued they needed the diaries because Reagan could not recall
many details of Iran-Contra, including when he learned of a
November 1985 shipment of missiles to Iran.
   On Thursday during the trial in Washington, Poindexter's lawyers
finished showing nearly eight hours of Reagan's videotaped
testimony.
   Reagan was in Boston to visit the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
and attend a fund-raiser for the institute's Jimmy Fund.
   During a ceremony at the institute, the former president was
presented with a glass sculpture and a baseball cap by cancer
patients Ashley Fitzgerald, 5, and Julie Green, 15.
   Other children suffering from cancer also gave the Reagan a
poster with all their names emblazoned on it.
   ``I was able to tell them it's going to be hung in the
presidential library,'' Reagan told reporters after his tour.
   Green, a straight-A high school sophomore who has Hodgkin's
disease, said she just found out a week ago that she was going to
meet Reagan _ so she didn't have time to get excited.
   ``I'm really amazed they called me,'' she said. ``I really like
President Reagan. I feel very lucky.''
   After meeting the children, Reagan was whisked to a Jimmy Fund
benefit.
   At the banquet, Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn presented the former
president with jellybeans on behalf of the city, forsaking the
traditional Revere Bowl or Lantern of Liberty.
   ``We just knew that wouldn't be appropriate enough,'' Flynn said.

   Helicopters carrying water-filled ``Bambi
buckets'' have helped officials control a fire that threatened to
destroy the world's first project to restore rare captive monkeys
to the wild in Brazil.
   ``We were probably days away from the extinction of a species,''
said Benjamin Beck, associate director of the National Zoo in
Washington, D.C.
   The fire was fought with two helicopters belonging to the
Brazilian federal police. When a call came to Washington alerting
Beck to the fire, the Friends of the National Zoo and Wildlife
Preservation Trust of Philadelphia immediately raised $6,000 to
send two ``Bambi buckets'' to the reserve, Beck said Thursday.
   ``From the time the request came to me, until they were in use
in Brazil, was less than 72 hours,'' he said.
   A Bambi bucket, Beck explained, is a large vessel that hangs
beneath the helicopter and allows the aircraft to dip into bodies
of water, without landing, and drop the water on the fire.
   ``The fire is, we feel, under control, but it's still burning
deep in turf in the swamps,'' Beck said.
   Enough organic matter and oxygen are available to keep the fire
smouldering, he said, adding:
   ``If it gets dry and windy, it can break out at any time.''
   The National Zoo has been coordinating a project to breed the
highly endangered golden lion tamarins and return them to the Poco
das Antas reserve in Brazil, about 75 miles northeast of Rio de
Janeiro.
   The fire broke out about Feb. 2 at Poco das Antas, home to about
400 tamarins. They make up about 80 percent of the remaining wild
population, Beck said.
   Sonia Rigueira of Conservation International in Washington said
the fire burned about a week. ``They lost control for a while, and
then they got the helicopters,'' she said in a telephone interview
from Brazil.
   The fire was confined to the grassy areas that make up about
half of the reserve, she said. The other half _ mature forest where
the tamarins live _ was undisturbed, she said.
   ``Had the fire progressed into the mature forest, we would have
seen this species come to extinction,'' said Beck.
   The golden lion tamarin is a cat-size primate with a leonine
mane and bright, burnt-orange fur. It is native to Brazil's
Atlantic coastal forest, which once covered Brazil's eastern flank
but is now reduced to patches comprising only a few percent of its
original size.
   ``It is a beautiful and interesting primate,'' Beck said. ``But
probably more important is, if it can survive, virtually the entire
ecosystem can survive.''
   The golden lion tamarin is what biologists call a flagship
species. Its survival depends on the health of the ecosystem it
lives in.
   Saving the golden lion tamarin is inextricably linked with
saving what remains of the Atlantic coastal forest, a unique region
brimming with plants and animals that live nowhere else on Earth,
Beck said.
   The animals and the reserve could not have been saved without
the effort by Brazil, Beck said.
   ``We ought to give credit to a tremendous response by Brazilian
authorities,'' he said.

   About 300 Mon guerrillas attacked a
southern town of Ye, fighting government troops for six hours in a
battle in which 50 people were killed, a state-controlled newspaper
said today.
   Rebels of the New Mon State Party attacked the town of Ye, about
200 miles southeast of Rangoon early Thursday, the Working People's
Daily said.
   It said they retreated six hours later after 43 of them were
killed. Four Burmese soldiers and three civilians, including two
women and a child were also killed, the paper said.
   Fourteen Burmese troops and 16 civilians were wounded, the
report said.
   There was no independent confirmation of the attack or the
casualties. Western diplomats in Rangoon and other observers
consider many reports in the state press exaggerated.
   The Mon are one of several minority ethnic groups that have
fought for decades against central control. In the past 18 months,
Rangoon has stepped up its campaign to drive the rebels from their
bases along the Thai border.

   A new migration of the damned has begun in
the Horn of Africa.
   Once again, as so often in the past, drought and war have forced
tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children from their
homes in Ethiopia and Sudan in a desperate search for food.
   Many will not find it.
   As the United Nations and private agencies struggle to begin
long-delayed relief operations, more and more people are joining
the exodus from war-torn villages and parched farms.
   The United Nations says more than 4 million people are at risk
of starvation in northern Ethiopia alone. At least half a million
more face the same fate in southern Sudan.
   Those figures far exceed the nearly 1 million who perished in
Ethiopia's famine of 1984-85.
   ``We could be looking at a repeat of that,'' said a relief
agency official in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital. ``If we can't
break the logjam soon, people are going to start dying in numbers.''
   The official, like many others involved in negotiations to move
food through government and insurgent military lines, would not
speak for attribution.
   The crisis is getting high-level attention.
   In Washington, it was disclosed recently that Secretary of State
James A. Baker III had written Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze about the problem.
   Baker sought a joint U.S.-Soviet effort to obtain a cease-fire
between the Addis Ababa government and two insurgent armies.
   Many aid officials see that as an essential first step in
ensuring the free passage of food to the needy in northern Ethiopia
and ending the recurrent problem of famine.
   On Wednesday, Ethiopia renewed preliminary talks with one of the
rebel groups in Rome and said it would meet with the other
insurgent group in Nairobi next month.
   Meanwhile, a truck convoy carrying 110 tons of food was allowed
to pass safely through the contested area between a government-held
provincial capital and a rebel-controlled town in northern Ethiopia
at midweek.
   The first convoy in the relief operation, managed by a
consortium of Ethiopian church groups and supplied by American and
Western European donors, was described as a trial run, but
officials were elated.
   Still, they acknowledged they would at best be able to reach no
more than 1 million people in Tigre and Wollo provinces and,
possibly, the extreme southern part of Eritrea _ or about a fourth
of those in need.
   The Tigre People's Liberation Front, with whom the government
reopened talks in Rome this week, has controlled Tigre and much of
neighboring Wollo and Gondor provinces since last year.
   The United Nations began appealing last year for 1.1 million
tons of food, most of which it hoped to ship to Ethiopia's Red Sea
port of Massawa for further distribution inland.
   But just as the first shipments were arriving in February, the
largest of the two insurgent groups, the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front, broke a nearly yearlong cease-fire and attacked
government troops along a 200-mile front. Within three days the
rebels claimed the capture of Massawa.
   The government, which has never acknowledged Massawa's fall, is
reliably reported to have retaliated with aerial and artillery
bombardments that destroyed tons of donated grain, killed dozens of
civilians and may have ruined port facilities.
   The fighting has effectively closed the port and the only road
inland to the provincial capital of Asmara, which is still held by
the government.
   U.N. and other aid officials say more than 30,000 people already
have made the long, dangerous trek from their homes in northern
Ethiopia into neighboring Sudan or to government-held areas in
Ethiopia's Eritrea province.
   ``We can't really count all those already on the move, because
we don't have access to many areas,'' the relief official in Addis
Ababa said. ``We do know this: It's bad and getting worse.''
   It was hoped that adequate food distribution throughout the
region this year would prevent the mass migrations that occurred in
1984-85, when hundreds of thousands of people trekked to
ill-prepared feeding centers. Malnourished and weak, many died en
route. Of those who made it, more died of disease caused by
overcrowding than starvation.
   To the west of Ethiopia, in Sudan, a similar situation exists.
   There, additional tens of thousands have been displaced in
recent months by a 7-year-old civil war that already has killed an
estimated 500,000 unarmed civilians.
   A U.N.-sponsored relief effort was credited with savings
thousands of people from starvation in southern Sudan last year,
and a second phase of the project, known as Operation Lifeline
Sudan, is scheduled to start next month.
   But on Tuesday, the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army
objected to the U.N. operation, saying its plan for distributing
food favored the government. Without specifically saying so, the
rebels indicated they may try to halt the operation unless the plan
is altered.

   Richard Nixon's longtime friend
Charles ``Bebe'' Rebozo said the president laughed when he first
heard of the break-in at the Watergate headquarters of the
Democratic Party.
   Rebozo, who owns the Key Biscayne Bank, gave a rare interview to
The Miami Herald to help promote a benefit he and Nixon are holding
for the Boys Club.
   He said Nixon was visiting him at his Key Biscayne home in June
1972 when they first heard news of the incident that, two years
later, led the president to resign in disgrace.
   ``We were swimming at Key Biscayne in front of my house,''
Rebozo said in the interview published Thursday. ``They came out
and told him. He said, `What in God's name were they doing there?'''
   Then, said Rebozo, ``We laughed and forgot about it.''
   The banker said the subsequent scandal, in which he was also

it had I not seen what he was taking, and how he was surviving,''

   ``Batman'' and ``Beetlejuice'' director Tim
Burton is being deliberately vague about his latest project _
``Edward Scissorhands,'' a suburban fantasy film about a man
created with shears of metal for fingers.
   ``It's very different,'' Burton said. ``We're going to sort of
make it up as we go along.''
   Burton and stars Johnny Depp, Dianne Wiest and Winona Ryder
arrived here Thursday to start three months of production on the
film, scheduled for Christmas release.
   According to 20th Century Fox, ``Scissorhands'' is about a man
who was created, not born. He was given everything he needed to
lead a full life, except one thing: His inventor's untimely death
left Edward with sharp shears of metal where his fingers should
have been.
   He lives in seclusion until he is discovered by an earnest Avon
lady and his life changes forever.
   Preparations for filming have been made in a Tampa neighborhood,
where several homes have been painted garish colors to create a
surreal suburban atmosphere.

   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca received an
unexpected welcome when he visited an alternative school aimed at
salvaging school dropouts _ a rendition of the ``Iacocca Rap.''
   ``Lee Iacocca, for all you do, we dedicate this rap to you,''
Aaron Bolton, 20, began when Iacocca visited Rich's Academy, based
in downtown Rich's Department Store, on Thursday.
   Bolton, with the help of a friend who kicked out a drumbeat by
using his mouth as a percussion instrument, began swaying to the
beat as he rapped for a wide-eyed Iacocca:
   ``He left Ford Motor Company with a plan on the double.
   ``Became Chrysler's CEO, found out they were in trouble.
   ``He designed a new automobile, they called the `K.'
   ``His new car and charming wit surely saved the day.''
   Iacocca toured the alternative school, formed in 1981, to see if
he could use it as a model for similar schools through the Iacocca
Institute, the philanthropic arm of Chrysler housed at Lehigh
University, his alma mater.
   Iacocca exhorted about 80 students to find a subject they like
and to stay with it. ``It's that basic,'' he said. ``I don't know
what else to tell you.''

   Singer Mick Jagger said there's nothing wrong with
the Rolling Stones taking commercial sponsorship for their first
European tour in eight years because, ``We are all in a business in
one way or another.''
   Jagger spoke at a news conference Thursday announcing the
12-country tour.
   Asked why the tour needed the sponsorship of a U.S. beer
company, Jagger told reporters: ``We are all in a business in one
way or another. We've got sponsorship and you have got advertising.
I don't even remember a time when it was amateur.''
   The tour starts in the Netherlands May 18 and includes dates in
Austria, Britain, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Norway,
Portugal, Spain, Sweden and West Germany.
   Rolling Stones publicist Bernard Doherty said more than 150,000
tickets were sold within hours for two London concerts at Wembley
Stadium, and a third Wembley show was being organized to meet
demand.
   He said negotiations were under way to end the tour with a
concert in Moscow in August, but agreement had not yet been reached.

   The Rev. Daniel Berrigan must pay a $500 fine
for contempt of court by Monday and cannot put off payment while he
appeals the citation, a federal judge said.
   The 68-year-old anti-war activist was among 24 people convicted
of disruption in a federal building during a Dec. 1 sit-in
protesting U.S. military aid to El Salvador.
   U.S. District Judge Peter Beer found Berrigan in contempt of
court and fined him $500 on Feb. 8 for failing to appear for his
arraignment Dec. 14.
   Attorney Bill Quigley of New Orleans said the fine should be put
off pending an appeal. Beer rejected that argument Wednesday.
   ``It's conceivable that Father Berrigan will refuse to pay and
face another jail term,'' Quigley said Thursday. Or, he said,
Berrigan might let his supporters pay the fine.

<HEAD>Health Officials Stumped by Supplement's Link to Blood Disorder</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After receiving reports of more than 1,400
cases of a rare and sometimes fatal blood disorder, federal health
officials are still puzzled by its connection to the dietary
supplement L-tryptophan.
   They have found no contaminant or bad batch of raw material, no
single brand that seems to be the culprit.
   ``We have analyzed hundreds of products, but we have not been
able to single out any brand, manufacturer or supplier that would
explain why people are getting sick from taking this stuff,'' said
Chris Lecos, a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration.
   Even so, the FDA announced Thursday that it was expanding its
recall of L-tryptophan supplements to include products that contain
even small amounts of it.
   The initial recall, announced last Nov. 17, was for supplements
in which L-tryptophan was the sole or major component and would
provide a daily intake of more than 100 milligrams.
   But now at least one case has been reported in which the person
developed the newly recognized blood disorder after taking less
than 100 milligrams a day.
   The disorder is called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or EMS. So
far, 1,411 cases have been reported in all states, including 19
deaths.
   EMS is marked by severe muscle and joint pain, breathing
difficulties, swelling of the arms and legs, skin rash, fatigue,
cough and sometimes fever. In some cases, victims show signs of
congestive heart failure or develop a condition that causes
progressive weakness and sometimes leads to paralysis.
   L-tryptophan, an amino acid, has been around for many years and
occurs naturally in some foods, including milk, beef, turkey and
beans.
   L-tryptophan supplements are usually sold over the counter in
health food, drug and grocery stores under different brand names.
They are taken for insomnia, appetite control, depression,
premenstrual syndrome, stress reduction and other problems.
   ``There are literally hundreds of brands involved here with
various levels of L-tryptophan in them,'' the FDA's Lecos said.
   In a typical recall, the FDA knows who made the product, how
much was produced and where and when it was distributed.
   ``But here's a situation where the only unequivocal fact is that
people who come down with EMS are people taking L-tryptophan before
they became ill,'' he said. ``As our investigation has continued,
we have discovered that many of these people were taking not just
one brand, but six or more brands.''
   The expanded recall applies to all L-tryptophan products in
tablet, capsule, caplet, powdered or liquid form, as well
multi-ingredient, non-protein supplements that contain
L-tryptophan, the FDA said.
   The only products containing L-tryptophan not being recalled are
some protein supplements, infant formulas and special dietary
foods, intravenous and oral solutions, in which small amounts of
L-tryptophan are needed for nutrition fortification, the FDA said.
   No cases of EMS have been linked to any of those uses, the
agency said.
   However, it was not clear whether certain products like diet and
body-building supplements containing L-tryptophan would have to be
recalled. Some of these are formulated according to FDA
regulations, but others are not and may contain large amounts of it.
   The FDA said it would issue a clarification further defining
what is subject to the recall.
   L-tryptophan is not an FDA-approved drug ingredient, so it
cannot be included in any medications, prescription or over the
counter.
   The Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents
companies that make nutritional supplements, said virtually all of
its member companies that make L-tryptophan products have removed
all brands and dosage forms from their distribution channels and
have notified retailers.

   Read his lips: no more broccoli.
   George Bush on Thursday demonstrated just how far presidential
power can go when he insisted he would just say no to vegetables.
   ``I'm president of the United States and I'm not going to eat
any more broccoli!'' Bush proclaimed, resolving to stand fast
against his wife's mealtime entreaties.
   Broccoli-booster Barbara Bush tried to put a good face on her
husband's rebellion.
   Asked what example the 65-year-old president was setting for
America's children, the first lady replied crisply: ``He ate
broccoli until he was 60. Tell them to eat it until they're 60.''
   She said the president's 88-year-old mother, Dorothy Walker
Bush, still eats her broccoli.
   Bush's taste in food runs to pork rinds, olives, taco salads and
Tabasco sauce. He set some new culinary standards in December when
he was spotted crunching bits of Butterfingers candy bars into oat
bran.
   Bush's bravado has not gone unanswered by the broccoli industry.
California growers are shipping 10 tons of the vegetable to soup
kitchens and shelters in the nation's capital.
   Bush, accused at times of indecisiveness, was bold about
broccoli.
   ``I do not like broccoli and I haven't liked it since I was a
little kid and my mother made me eat it and I'm president of the
United States and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli,'' Bush
declared at the end of an alfresco news conference.
   And he said that was his last word on the subject.
   ``There are truckloads of broccoli at this very minute
descending on Washington. My family is divided,'' he acknowledged.
   ``For the broccoli vote out there: Barbara loves broccoli. She
has tried to make me eat it. She eats it all the time herself,''
Bush said. ``So she can go out and meet the caravan of broccoli
that's coming in.''
   The broccoli brouhaha erupted when a news magazine reported Bush
had banned the vegetable from Air Force One.
   The president said he simply informed stewards, ``Don't you dare
bring me another sprig!''

   This may sound like a corny caper, but
President Bush is giving broccoli the kohlrabi shoulder.
   He's often bean told to eat vegetables. But no longer will
meekly respond: mustard I?
   I carrot stand it, he finally said of the cruciferous greenery.
It makes me artichoke, lettuce have it no more. Let's cauliflower a
vegetable.
   And he isn't sorrel about the decision.
   It didn't take long for word to leek out that the president
would turnip his nose at veggies.
   The news left the president with eggplant on his face as far as
farmers were concerned.
   The growers didn't take an endive, though, and tomato story
worse, they've stalked the president and given him lots of truffle.
They are exercising freedom of spinach to defend their produce.
   They beet it to the phones and called charitable groups in
Washington, offering to donate 10 tons of broccoli to the poor.
It's their way to protest at the presidential parsnip-ishness.
   That's okra with us, said the charities. They never look a gift
horseradish in the mouth.
   Wilt that end the kale. It remains to pea seen.
   It's the kind of story that, if not nipped in the bud, can just
go onion and onion.

<HEAD>Italy Stops Auction of Mussolini Papers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Auctioneers say the Italian government has stopped
them from selling papers connected with dictator Benito Mussolini.
   ``The Italian government told us that under a law of 1943 all
material owned by Mussolini's National Fascist Party belonged to
the government, so we withdrew the 10 lots of Mussolini papers''
from a sale Thursday, said Nina Drummond, a spokeswoman for the
Phillips auction house.
   The most important of the documents was the original telegram
summoning Mussolini to Rome to form a government in 1922. The
telegram, signed by an aide of King Victor Emmanuel III, had been
expected to sell for up to $15,900.
   The telegram gave Mussolini power that he retained until his
support dwindled during World War II and he was overthrown in July
1943. Resistance fighters killed him in April 1945.
   ``What puzzled us was that some of the material was sold at
Sotheby's in 1982 and apparently the Italian authorities took no
action at that time,'' Ms. Drummond said.
   Leonardo Visconti, press attache at the Italian Embassy, said
authorities in Rome were able to act because of the publicity
surrounding the Phillips sale.
   ``We are taking legal steps to reclaim this material from
Phillips,'' he said.
   Other material withdrawn from the sale included the autographed
draft of a speech by Mussolini in 1925 and his identity card from
1913.
   Phillips did not identify the owners nor discuss how the
material ended in private hands. ``I think some or all of it was
gathered up in the chaos of the last months of the war,'' Ms.
Drummond said.

<TEXT>
   Disability-rights groups are praising a Bush
administration decision to require federally aided bus lines to buy
only buses accessible to wheelchairs and provide door-to-door
service for the handicapped.
   The Transportation Department announced a tentative rule
Thursday that matches key provisions of legislation that the
advocacy groups have been trying to urge through Congress with
protest action.
   More than 150 people were arrested in Washington during
demonstrations for the bill last week.
   Dennis Kouba, a spokesman for the American Public Transit
Association, said most bus operators already are purchasing only
vehicles equipped with lifts or other devices. But he said
officials were assessing other provisions of the proposed rule.
   Operators currently have a choice of either accessible buses or
special door-to-door service to serve hundreds of thousands of
people who have difficulty taking ordinary buses. Nearly all public
transit systems receive some federal funding.
   Timothy Cook, spokesman for the National Disability Action
Center, said the rule would give handicapped Americans ``everything
they have been fighting for.''
   ``My clients are very, very pleased. They will finally get
access to services they need to get going,'' said Cook, whose
organization has been involved in litigation on behalf of the
handicapped.
   Wade Blank, head of Americans Disabled for Accessible Public
Transportation, said he was ``delighted that the administration
finally has followed through on its commitment to persons with
disabilities.''
   The rule is expected to become law in September after a period
for public comment that could lead to some changes in its
provisions.
   Requiring both access and special services for all systems is
expected to ``increase significantly the amount and quality of
service available to persons with disabilities,'' the
Transportation Department announcement said.
   ``The Bush administration is committed to policies that will
ensure that people with disabilities have the opportunities
available to other persons to use our mass transit system,'' said
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner.
   Announcement of the proposed rule met the requirements of a
Philadelphia federal court order that required the department to
examine and change existing regulations but did not mandate what
the changes should be. The order came in a suit by more than a
dozen disability-rights groups.
   The department is asking for comment on several options for
exempting transit companies that would find it too costly to
provide special services for the handicapped, but no exemptions
would be allowed for accessibility equipment on all new buses.
   The rule does not require that wheelchair lifts or other devices
be retrofitted onto existing buses, but it would apply to all new
and refurbished buses and require operators to attempt to buy only
used buses with such equipment if available.
   Estimates of the number of Americans who use wheelchairs range
from 750,000 to 1.5 million.

   President Bush is refusing to give Poland a
greater voice in talks on the reunification of Germany or to
endorse Warsaw's demands for an early treaty guaranteeing its
borders.
   ``I think we may have a nuance of difference here,'' Bush said
Thursday after concluding talks with Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki.
   After three days in Washington, Mazowiecki was heading to
Chicago today after a speech at the National Press Club.
   Bush gave an upbeat assessment of their meeting, saying he
assured Mazowiecki ``we see an important role for a free,
democratic and independent Poland as a factor for stability in
Europe in the future.''
   Speaking at a news conference, the president said he sees no
need for Soviet troops to be stationed in Poland or anywhere else
in Eastern Europe _ ``and the sooner they get out of there, the
better.''
   Mazowiecki, however, has said he wants the Soviet troops to stay
until issues of German reunification and the Polish border are
resolved.
   Bush said Mazowiecki had not given him any assurances on the
Soviet troop issue. Separately, Mazowiecki told reporters that his
government is prepared to start talks ``that will eventually lead
to total withdrawal'' of Soviet forces in Poland.
   Poland, fearing a reunified Germany might try to reclaim
territory ceded to Poland, wants the United States to back its
request that East and West Germany sign a treaty recognizing the
current Polish borders before reunification talks get under way.
   Bush said such a treaty is ``a matter for the Polish prime
minister to discuss with the leaders of Germany.''
   ``They are very, very close now,'' he added. ``So let them sort
it out.''
   The president also praised West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
for recent statements supporting the current Polish border. He said
Kohl had ``come a long way in his view'' since earlier remarks that
the border question should be decided by a reunified Germany.
   Bush said Poland will have a voice at the reunification talks
among the two Germanys and the four chief World War II victors _
the United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain _ whenever
issues related to Polish borders are raised.
   Poland wants a greater role in the talks, asking to be present
whenever issues affecting its security were discussed. But Bush
reiterated the limited role for Poland in the discussions, saying,
``We don't see this as the group that is going to determine the
fate of all of Europe.''
   Mazowiecki said that he was ``very pleased'' with his meeting
with the president and that ``there are no problems between us'' on
Bush's desire to see Soviet troops out of Eastern Europe.
   ``The only problem is to persuade both our German partners that
it needs to be done swiftly and finally,'' Mazowiecki said.

<TEXT>
   Conservative Robert Sweet's fight for
confirmation as head of the government's juvenile justice program
is headed for Senate action.
   Three of the eight Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee
joined six Republicans as the panel voted 9-5 to send Sweet's
nomination to the Senate floor for a final vote on confirmation.
   ``Objectivity won out over partisan politics,'' Sen. Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., said following approval of the 52-year-old Sweet,
a veteran of political turmoil at the Education Department in the
Reagan administration.
   Humphrey said the margin in committee ``makes it likely the
nomination will be confirmed on the floor, though I'm sure we can
count on further opposition from left-wing groups, like the
national teachers' unions.''
   One of Sweet's chief Senate critics, Sen. John F. Kerry,
D-Mass., wrote committee members on Wednesday, urging a vote
against Sweet.
   He said a confirmation hearing three weeks ago showed the
nominee's ``relative indifference to the programs and policies that
are at the heart of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention.''
   Kerry said Sweet's ``approach to juvenile justice is naive at
best and in any case not congruent with the statutory requirements
of the position to which he has been nominated.''
   By law, the administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Prevention in the Justice Department must have
experience in the juvenile justice field. The $70 million program
distributes grants to state and local governments to help combat
delinquency.
   Sweet says his background in education fulfills the requirement.
He is a former high school teacher and textbook salesman and served
as an Education Department official and White House education
adviser.
   He also headed the New Hampshire affiliate of the Moral
Majority, founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell.
   ``Bob Sweet has devoted his entire life to working with youth
and is well qualified to serve,'' Humphrey said.
   Some criticism appears to stem from fierce political infighting
at the Education Department. Former Education Secretary Terrel Bell
said in his memoirs, ``The Thirteenth Man,'' that conservative
activists sought to control the department. He cited Sweet as one
of them.
   Democrats who voted to send the nomination to the floor were
Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Howell Heflin, D-Ala.; and Herb
Kohl, D-Wis. They joined Sens. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.; Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah; Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.; Charles Grassley, R-Iowa; Arlen
Specter, R-Pa.; and Humphrey.
   Opposing the nomination were committee Chairman Joseph Biden,
D-Del.; and Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Howard M. Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio; Paul Simon, D-Ill.; and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.

   The Maryland Senate early Friday approved
an agreement to end an eight-day anti-abortion filibuster by
turning the emotional issue over to voters come November.
   Under the compromise, the Senate approved two bills, an abortion
rights measure ratified by a 29-18 margin, and a more restrictive
bill favored by abortion opponents, which won 24-23 approval.
   Both measures now go to the House of Delegates, where they are
expected to receive quick attention.
   It is anticipated that at least one of the bills will be
petitioned to referendum, giving voters the opportunity in November
to select which they prefer.
   The abortion rights bill would become law unless rejected by
voters. In that case the restrictive law would become law, unless
it also was rejected by voters.
   House Speaker Clay Mitchell has said he would bring the House in
on Saturday if the Senate passed a bill by Friday.
   The two measures, Senate President Mike Miller told the Senate,
would present voters with ``a very, very clear choice. This is
participatory democracy at its very best.''
   But some abortion-rights supporters were not pleased.
   The compromise was merely a face-saving device to end the
filibuster, said Sen. F. Vernon Boozer, a pro-choice Republican,
and ``I don't think it's a good idea.''
   ``I think the concept is ridiculous,'' agreed Patricia R. Sher,
a Democrat.
   Democratic Sen. C. Bernard Fowler, who opposes abortion,
characterized the agreement as ``a long roll of the dice.''
   Anti-abortion forces took the gamble because ``we feel we may
never have this opportunity again,'' Fowler said. ``We don't know
that we can hold a filibuster together again next year.''
   Abortion rights forces had been trying for a week to muster the
32 votes they needed to shut off the debate.
   They moved to within a vote of ending the debate Tuesday when
they lost a cloture vote by a 31-16 margin. Thirty-two votes, or
two-thirds of the 47-member Senate, are required to shut off debate.
   At stake in the battle was a measure that would allow
unrestricted access to abortions until the point in a pregnancy
when a fetus is able to survive outside the womb. After fetal
viability, abortions could be performed to save the life of the
mother or to protect her health.
   The pro-choice bill also also would require doctors to notify
parents when their unmarried teen-age daughters seek an abortion.
   Anti-abortion forces thought the bill was too liberal. They
insist that abortions after the fetus becomes viable should be
restricted to those needed to save the life of the mother.
   The anti-abortion forces also wanted to limit abortions before
fetal viability to cases of rape or incest or to protect the
woman's health.

<HEAD>Moderate Fat Reduction in Diet Can Reduce New Blocks In Arteries,
Study Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even a small reduction in a person's dietary fat
intake can mean a sharp drop in the risk of developing new clogs in
the heart arteries, a study released today shows.
   Dr. David H. Blankenhorn, director of the Atheroslerosis
Research Institute at the University of Southern California School
of Medicine in Los Angeles, said the 82 middle-aged male heart
bypass patients who were studied were ``all free-living citizens
who selected their own diet.''
   ``These were not really austere diets,'' he went on. ``The idea
may be out there that you've really got to eat a restricted diet or
lose weight. ... These guys didn't lose weight.''
   He said all had diet counseling, adding, ``but some of them
listened a little harder than others. The ones who reduced high-fat
meats and milk and substituted low-fat meat and low-fat milk were
the ones who didn't get new lesions.''
   The two-year study was of men who had undergone heart bypass
surgery and had been advised to reduce their total fat consumption
to 26 percent of total calories _ including specified reductions in
saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats.
   In the typical American diet, fat accounts for 40 percent of
total calories consumed.
   The results of the study were reported in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   Subjects underwent angiograms, dye-enhanced X-rays of the heart,
before and after the two-year period, during which they were
quizzed semi-monthly about all the food they'd eaten in the
previous 24 hours.
   After two years, 18 of the men had developed new fatty deposits
in their coronary arteries, and 64 men had not.
   ``The question is why? What's the difference between these two
groups?'' said Dr. Linda Cashin-Hemphill, an assistant USC
professor and a colleague of Blankenhorn's.
   Dietary analysis revealed that men who were free of new fatty
deposits, or lesions, had reduced their total fat consumption,
while the men who had developed new lesions had increased total fat
consumption.
   ``Knowing that polyunsaturated fats decrease cholesterol,
instead of decreasing total fat, they (men with new lesions)
increased polyunsaturated fats _ not a good idea,'' Ms.
Cashin-Hemphill said in a telephone interview.
   Excess blood cholesterol is one of the three main modifiable
traits associated with increased risk of developing heart disease.
The others are high blood pressure and smoking.
   ``The bottom line of the study is that total fats should be
reduced,'' Ms. Hemphill said.
   The men who were free of new lesions at the study's end had
begun with a mean total fat intake of 32.9 percent of calories
consumed. They lowered their total fat to 27.5 percent of calories
consumed, the researchers said.
   In contrast, the men who developed new lesions had started at a
fat intake of 31.1 percent of calories consumed and went up to 34.1
percent, the researchers reported.
   Consumption of saturated fats _ found in high-fat meats and
dairy products as well as in tropical oils _ had gone down in both
groups, but was reduced more in the group with no new lesions, the
researchers found.
   Consumption of polyunsaturated fats in both groups had gone up,
but consumption in the group with new lesions had gone up more than
twice as much as the other group.
   Dr. Dean Ornish, director of the Preventive Medicine Research
Institute at the University of California at San Francisco School
of Medicine, said, ``This is an important study, because it
demonstrates that even moderate changes in diet can help prevent
the formation of coronary artery blockages.''
   Previous research has shown that cholesterol-lowering drugs are
effective in preventing existing lesions from growing, but this is
the first study showing that diet alone can prevent formation of
new lesions, the authors said.

   High blood pressure patients taking medications
known as beta blockers temporarily increase their risk of suffering
heart pain or heart attack if they abruptly stop taking the
medication, a study says.
   The research published in today's edition of the Journal of the
American Medical Association said the increased risk extends even
to patients with no history of heart disease.
   Patients who suddenly withdrew from the beta blockers showed a
temporary four-fold increase in risk, according to the study by Dr.
Bruce M. Psaty and colleagues at the University of Washington in
Seattle.
   ``If patients need to withdraw from use of beta blockers, they
should probably taper the dosage gradually over a period of several
weeks,'' the authors said.
   Beta blockers act to relieve stress on the heart, lungs and
blood vessels by blocking adrenaline from overstimulated nerves
supplying those tissues.
   Beta blockers are prescribed for problems with a wide range of
severity. They are given to relieve high blood pressure in patients
with no history of heart trouble; to ease problems linked to
definite heart disease, such as heart pain and abnormal rhythms;
and to ward off second heart attacks.
   Though it was known that patients who abruptly stop taking beta
blockers could experience a sudden return of their symptoms,
patients who take the drugs only for high blood pressure and who
have no known heart disease had been considered at low risk for
heart problems, the authors said.
   They based their conclusion on a study of 248 cases of new heart
problems from 1982 through 1984 among people enrolled in a
Washington state health-maintenance organization.
   Records on more than 700 other enrollees without heart problems
but with high blood pressure were used for comparison.
   All of the patients had been taking beta blockers: propranolol
hydrochloride, marketed generically and as Inderal; nadolol,
marketed as Corgard and Corzide; metoprolol tartrate, marketed as
Lopressor; and atenolol, marketed as Tenoretic and Tenormin.
   The report focused on ``recent stoppers,'' defined by the
authors as regular beta-blocker users who did not fill their
prescriptions soon enough to be regarded as complying with dosage
instructions to an 80 percent level.
   Eleven patients were identified as recent stoppers, based on
pharmacy records. Of the 11, four were from the group with no heart
problems, and seven from the group with new heart problems.
   One of the seven suffered from heart pain, three had non-fatal
heart attacks and three had fatal heart attacks, the researchers
said.
   The eleven had taken beta blockers for an average of 2.9 years,
they said.
   Researchers estimated that the 11 patients stopped taking their
medication about 12 days before they were admitted to the hospital
or died.

<HEAD>Nunn Sees Gaps in Defense Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's $307 billion defense budget
contains several major gaps in assessing the overall threat to the
West and shaping military strategy, says the chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
   But Defense Secretary Dick Cheney urged critics to examine what
the Pentagon is doing to restructure U.S. forces, contending that
his department had done a ``complete rethinking of missions and
strategy.''
   In a rhetorical skirmish between two of the leading players in
the battle over the defense budget, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said
Thursday that if the Pentagon wants to stay credible, it must fill
the large holes in the spending blueprint.
   ``I hope these blanks will be filled in by the Defense
Department, but the Congress will have to act if the Defense
Department doesn't,'' the Armed Services chairman said in a speech
on the Senate floor.
   Nunn cited at least five ``big blanks'' in Bush's budget: the
absence of an assessment of the threat to U.S. national security, a
military strategy in response to the threat, the future size of the
armed forces, how to meet required budget cuts and the need for
major weapons.
   Bush's budget, he said, is based on a 1988 threat and a 1988
strategy.
   ``Essentially, the administration took the level of spending and
programs for fiscal year 1991 that was developed back in 1988 and
reduced it for fiscal reasons,'' Nunn said. ``They have not
adjusted the underlying assumptions about threat and strategy.''
   But in a speech to the National Press Club, Cheney accused
lawmakers of offering ``complaints instead of solutions.''
   Cheney prefaced his speech by noting that Nunn had just spoken
on Capitol Hill but said his comments should not be construed as
being directed at the senator.
   The defense secretary said he has told the military to take into
account the assumptions that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
will be ``at least partially successful'' in domestic reforms.
   In addition, he said, planners should assume that the
superpowers will implement successful arms control agreements in
conventional and strategic forces; that all Soviet forces have
withdrawn from Eastern Europe and that democratically elected,
non-communist governments are in their place.
   While such assumptions are ``a rosy scenario,'' Cheney said, he
has used them to design the defense budget from now through 1997,
and to help the service chiefs plan for the mid-1990s.
   Nunn said he found ``fragmentary answers'' from the
administration to the question of what effect the push for
democracy in Eastern Europe and the changes in the Soviet Union
will have on the traditional threats to U.S. security.
   ``We should expect that the changes in the threat would be more
apparent in the Defense Department's budget request,'' Nunn said.
   The budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 includes more
than $16 billion for five major weapons programs _ the B-2 stealth
bomber, the C-17 transport plane, the Advanced Tactical Fighter,
the Advanced Tactical Aircraft and the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Cheney said those programs are being reviewed and the results
will be ready in time for Congress' budget process.
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, a senior Pentagon official refused to
rule out a possible trade of the rail-garrison MX nuclear missile
for the Soviet's SS-24 missile as part of the negotiations to
reduce strategic weapons.
   ``This is obviously a serious proposal advanced by serious
people and needs to be given serious consideration,'' Stephen
Hadley, assistant secretary of defense for international security
policy, told a House Armed Services Committee policy panel.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., the committee chairman, criticized the
administration's current proposal in U.S.-Soviet talks to reduce
strategic arms for legitimizing the B-2 bomber and two land-based,
nuclear missile systems.
   Aspin and several other committee members said chances were slim
that Congress will approve the full fleet of 132 B-2 bombers and
future funds for the single-warhead Midgetman and the
multiple-warhead MX missile.
   ``We're not going to buy 132 and I maintain it's not a
responsible position for the U.S. government to pursue arms control
based on buying 132,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, an opponent
of the B-2 bomber.
   ``I can't tell you how many we're going to buy, I can't tell you
the plan's going to work.''

<HEAD>Discovery Astronauts Excited to Launch Hubble Space Telescope</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander of the upcoming
Discovery shuttle mission says the Hubble Space Telescope his crew
will put into orbit should help scientists unlock mysteries about
the heavens.
   The powerful $1.5 billion astronomical observatory, the most
expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built, will be put in orbit 370
miles above the Earth where it can provide scientists a clearer
view of space because it will be unhindered by atmospheric
distortion.
   If all goes according to plan, Hubble will be deployed a day
after Discovery and its five crew members blast into space from
Cape Canaveral, Fla., on April 12.
   ``We're getting very excited,'' Discovery commander Loren J.
Shriver said Thursday at the crew's final news conference before
the mission. ``We've been training for a long time. This is a major
milestone ... We're glad to be finally this close to launch.''
   The 25,000-pound, 43-foot-long telescope originally was
scheduled for launch in late 1983 but technical problems postponed
liftoff until 1986. The Challenger accident on Jan. 28, 1986,
delayed the mission until 1989, and concern over the shuttle's
solid rocket boosters pushed it back yet again.
   It has been a long wait for the scientists waiting to use the
telescope.
   ``They're beaming with pride at the prospect of finally getting
the space telescope that they've worked with for so long ... to
finally see it getting so close and producing results in the near
future,'' said Shriver, an Air Force colonel commanding his first
shuttle flight.
   Hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so
distant that their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14
billion years _ meaning that scientists will see what the objects
looked like near the creation of the universe, an estimated 15
billion years ago.
   The telescope's location above Earth's atmosphere will enable it
to detect light of all wavelengths, including ultraviolet, before
it is absorbed or distorted by the atmosphere.
   It will look seven times more deeply into space and detect
objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the
best ground-based observatory. Its eight-foot primary optical
mirror is the most precise ever made.
   Such a view into space could explain how the universe was
created.
   ``I think they're going to make some discoveries and answer some
questions we've got now and probably raise a lot more than we know
about right now,'' Shriver said.
   Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, mission specialist Steven
A. Hawley will maneuver the telescope out of the shuttle's cargo
bay and hoist it away from the shuttle before letting go of it.
Shriver and the pilot, Marine Col. Charles F. Bolden Jr., will then
steer the shuttle away from Hubble.
   Mission specialists Kathryn D. Sullivan and Bruce McCandless, a
Navy captain, will be prepared to perform spacewalks should a
problem occur during the deployment.
   The veteran crew also has trained to return Discovery to the
telescope during the mission should ground controllers have trouble
making Hubble operational.

<HEAD>Democrats Moving to Cut Aid to El Salvador</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sentiment is growing among congressional
Democrats to cut aid to El Salvador.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on foreign operations, became the latest lawmaker to
complain that millions of dollars have done little to end the civil
war or improve the Central American country's human rights record.
   After 10 years and $3.8 billion, ``In many ways we are pretty
much at ground zero,'' Obey said Thursday. ``I don't want to be in
the perpetual motion of throwing money down a rat hole.''
   Obey said he sees little improvement in the country where
between 40,000 and 50,000 people have been killed in the last
decade.
   ``I personally don't feel I can vote for Salvador money,'' he
said.
   Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, urged caution in testimony to Obey's subcommittee. He said
prospects have never been better for a negotiated settlement
between the Salvadoran government and the left-wing rebels of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, known as the FMLN.
   The two sides say they will begin negotiations next month as a
first step toward ending the war.
   Moreover, Aronson said the ouster of the leftist Sandinista
government in Nicaragua that supported the Salvadoran rebels
eventually should weaken the FMLN.
   ``Let's not rush to do something that would screw this up,'' he
said. ``I think we can end this war.''
   Obey also questioned whether the government of President Alfredo
Cristiani is able to exercise enough control over the Salvadoran
military to proceed with negotiations. ``There is a high degree of
dubiousness and I share it,'' he said.
   Obey joins a number of House members and senators who have
raised questions about the aid and suggested cutting it or making
it conditional on a cease-fire or improvement in human rights.
   Heightened interest in the subject comes at the 10th anniversary
of the slaying of Archbishop Oscar Romero in San Salvador. His
unsolved killing and the resurgence of right-wing death squads
prompted the United States to throw its support behind the centrist
government in 1980.
   Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and John Kerry, D-Mass., have
introduced different bills that would place new conditions on
Salvadoran aid.
   Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., head of a congressional task force on
El Salvador, wants to cut aid by 50 percent based on a negotiated
cease-fire. If the government broke the cease-fire, all aid would
end. If the rebels violated the agreement, the government could
realize 100 percent of its aid.
   Meantime, Moakley's task force interviewed a U.S. Army major
about his knowledge of possible Salvadoran military involvement in
the killing of six Jesuit priests in San Salvador last Nov. 16.
   Moakley said details of the meeting were secret, but lawmakers
wanted to interview the man face-to-face. The task force plans to
issue a report on the killings in a few weeks.
   The United States is providing El Salvador with about $315
million in economic and military aid in the current fiscal year,
and the administration is seeking about $375 million for fiscal
1991, which begins Oct. 1.

   Congress is moving to tighten the screws on
bankers who cooperate with money-laundering operations of drug
traffickers.
   ``Banks that knowingly handle dirty drug money should not be
permitted to do business in this country,'' Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., said Thursday as he and other senators introduced
money-laundering legislation.
   A similar bill won 48-0 approval from the House Banking
Committee on Thursday amid heightened concern over drug profits
being laundered through Caribbean tax havens and centers of bank
secrecy and then returned to the United States.
   The Senate bill would require federal regulators to hold a
hearing on whether to close any bank convicted of money laundering.
   The House version would require such a hearing if the officers
and directors of the bank were also convicted.
   Under both measures, the bank's charter could be revoked or
regulators could appoint a conservator. Federal officials already
have the power to shut down banks that are operated improperly.
   Hearings under the bill would specifically apply to money
laundering and would be mandatory.
   Such hearings would have to consider the extent of management
involvement in the offense, whether the bank had the means to block
money laundering, the degree of cooperation with law enforcement
and whether new procedures had been put in place to prevent a
recurrence.
   Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, described
the House version as a compromise that would not only punish those
who ignore money laundering but also provide due process for
bankers.
   He hailed Reps. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.; Thomas R. Carper,
D-Del.; and Bill McCollum, R-Fla.; for working out a compromise
version.
   Citing estimates of $300 billion in annual drug profits
worldwide, Annunzio declared that the ``vast quantities of cash may
provide drug dealers with their greatest vulnerability to
detection.''
   ``The drug dealer is caught in a never-ending blizzard of cash
every day,'' Annunzio said.
   The House bill also calls for removal of bank officials
convicted of money laundering or structuring transactions to evade
requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act. Those found guilty would be
prohibited from affiliating with other financial institutions.
   It would require the Treasury Department to set forth
regulations aimed at halting money laundering by wire transfer. It
would raise the fine for negligent non-compliance with
money-laundering reporting requirements from $500 to $5,000.

   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley says he sought
to delay Supreme Court review of the federal flag-burning law so
the House could better defend it, not to deny Republican candidates
an issue this fall.
   ``I emphatically state that there was no political motive ... in
the filing of this brief other than to undertake the fullest
defense of a statute of this House,'' the Washington Democrat said
Thursday in an unusual speech on the House floor by a speaker.
   Foley spoke after an embarrassing loss to his chamber's
Republican minority. In a 309-101 vote, the House ordered its legal
counsel to withdraw a Foley-supported legal brief asking the high
court to delay review of the flag-burning law until October.
   If successful, that probably would take the flag issue, a GOP
favorite, out of the campaign leading up to the November elections.
   House Republican leader Robert Michel complained that he found
out about the brief only after it was filed and said ``this is part
of a pattern ... (of) insufficient consultation.''
   Michel, R-Ill., said the brief mispresented explicit language
included in the legislation last year that calls for expedited
review of any constitutional challenge. He offered a resolution
chastising the House counsel and calling for withdrawal of the
brief.
   And after other Republicans cast the issue as one of which party
is better at protecting the flag, dozens of Democrats deserted
their leadership to hand Foley his defeat.
   After the vote, Foley and Republican leaders met and agreed to
submit a new brief that would not address the question of timing of
the court review, said House Counsel Steven Ross.
   The law against desecration of the flag recently was ruled
unconstitutional in courts in Washington state and the District of
Columbia.
   The Justice Department appealed to the Supreme Court and asked
for speedy consideration.
   The court has asked the defendants in the flag-burning cases to
file their responses to the appeal by March 26. The defendants have
already stated they believe expedited review was aimed at the
political campaign and, since there is no emergency, they should
have more time to prepare their side.

   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, wants a final vote on a clean air bill within a week, but
fellow senators are refusing to be pinned to a specific deadline.
   Faced with scores of amendments not yet considered and several
unresolved controversies, Mitchell said Thursday that without an
agreed deadline he's not sure when the bill will be finally acted
upon.
   Late Thursday night, Mitchell sought approval from fellow
senators to establish a specific deadline for a final vote on the
measure before 6 p.m. March 29.
   But such a time deadline requires unanimous consent, and several
senators made clear their objections to being rushed to a final
vote with many amendments still to be considered.
   The legislation, the first tightening of federal air pollution
control in 13 years, would impose tougher restrictions on
automobiles, industry and electric power plants.
   Mitchell, who in February engineered a compromise agreement with
the White House on the bill in hopes of assuring quick passage,
said he had hoped to tell President Bush today that the end ``is in
sight.''
   ``I obviously will have to call him with different news,''
Mitchell added.
   In the House, meanwhile, the Energy and Commerce Committee took
another step Thursday in crafting its own clean air legislation by
reachng a compromise on tougher controls on smog in major cities.
   By a 38-2 vote, the committee approved provisions to:
   _Expand controls on smog-causing pollutants to include smaller
businesses in areas with the dirtiest air.
   _Eliminate waivers that would exempt some states or cities from
complying with pollution control measures if the cost of the
controls exceed a certain amount.
   _Preserve a requirement that the Environmental Protection Agency
impose an air pollution control plan in a city if local officials
fail to act.
   The Senate had rejected similar measures earlier this week. The
tougher provisions likely will be one of many differences that
eventually will have to be reconciled between the House and Senate.
   The House committee vote came after two days of negotiations
involving Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., and other senior members
of the panel. Many members first saw the inch-thick legislation
only minutes before voting on it.
   The House bill is not expected to reach the floor until May.
   Among the issues still confronting the Senate is what to do
about the appeal from Sen. Robert Byrd, D-Va., to provide financial
assistance to coal miners who lose their jobs because of tougher
sulfur dioxide emissions control on Midwest utility plants.
   Mitchell had hoped to resolve the issue Thursday, but by day's
end Byrd was reported to be considering a compromise proposal
crafted by Mitchell's staff and was not expected to respond until
next week, according to aides.
   Byrd wants $500 million over three years to help the coal
miners, but the White House has said that is too expensive and
violates the compromise agreement reached with Senate leaders.
   Meanwhile, Mitchell said he will continue to ``do everything I
can'' to push ahead with final action on the clean air bill by the
end of next week, although the prospects for keeping that deadline
are uncertain.
   The Senate is scheduled to resume action on the legislation on
Monday and Mitchell warned the senators to be prepared for
late-night sessions _ perhaps even all-night sessions _ running
into next weekend if necessary.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Approves Abortion Consent Decree</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Idaho Abortion, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge's approval of the settlement of a
lawsuit challenging state abortion-clinic restrictions came under
immediate attack from anti-abortion groups.
   ``It represents the absolute triumph of politics over law,''
said Victor Rosenblum, attorney for the Illinois Right to Life
Committee, when informed of Thursday's decision by U.S. District
Judge John Nordberg.
   Nordberg approved a consent decree worked out between Illinois
Attorney General Neil Hartigan and the American Civil Liberties
Union of Illinois, which represented the plaintiff, Dr. Richard
Ragsdale.
   ``The court finds the proposed consent decree lawful, fair,
reasonable and adequate,'' Nordberg said in his 13-page opinion.
   The consent decree eases state restrictions on abortion clinics
that Ragsdale had challenged as medically unnecessary for clinics
serving women fewer than 18 weeks pregnant.
   The decree establishes a new regulatory system mandating two
distinct kinds of abortion facility.
   For women fewer than 18 weeks pregnant, abortions can be
performed in clinic settings; the original regulations, which
required full service surgical facilities like those in a hospital,
will still apply in pregnancies of more than 18 weeks.
   ``I think it's a good decision. I think Judge Nordberg carefully
conducted a fairness hearing,'' said Hartigan, the Democratic
candidate for governor, whose office represented the state in the
case.
   Colleen K. Connell, director of the ACLU of Illinois'
Reproductive Rights Project, said: ``Under the settlement, women in
all parts of Illinois will have access to safe, affordable abortion
services.''
   But a coalition of anti-abortion groups will appeal Nordberg's
decision, possibly as early as today, said Joseph Scheidler,
president of the Pro-Life Action League.
   ``Basically, what we have is back-alley abortion. There is no
regulation'' under the ruling, Scheidler said.
   ``There is no evidence to support this contention,'' Nordberg
wrote. ``Far from leaving women unprotected, the settlement creates
a network of statutes and rules regulating the provision of
abortion services.''
   The settlement was reached Nov. 24, removing the case from the
U.S. Supreme Court docket only days before that court had been
scheduled to hear it.
   Abortion opponents had wanted the case to go to the high court
in hopes that it would lead to further tightening of federal
restrictions on abortion.
   In a telephone interview from his Rockford clinic, Ragsdale said
he was pleased with the ruling on his 1985 lawsuit.
   ``The only reason for opposing the issue as a whole is ignorance
of the facts,'' he said. ``Anyone who would tamper or seek to
further restrict abortion through legislation or intimidation is
seeking to have many women impoverished and humiliated and some
women maimed and dead.''
   The clinic restrictions, which went into effect in 1978, were
suspended after Ragsdale won decisions in U.S. District Court and
in the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   At issue were elaborate state requirements for non-hospital
surgical centers. Clinics were required to provide in-house
counseling, meet certain building-code specifications and prove
they were not duplicating similar services in their areas.
   Ragsdale contended the requirements were medically unnecessary
and discouraged abortion providers by forcing them to build ``the
equivalent of a small hospital,'' an expensive proposition that
effectively hampered access to abortion.

<HEAD>NASA Considering Possible Rescue Attempt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NASA is considering sending
astronauts to repair a stranded satellite or to bring it back to
Earth, but will meet with aerospace company officials again before
making a decision.
   ``Those are the options they're looking at, either reboost (to a
higher useful orbit) or retrieve,'' said Kyle Herring, a spokesman
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   NASA officials met for about seven hours at Johnson Space Center
on Thursday with representatives from Intelsat, the satellite's
owner, and Hughes Aircraft Co., which built the spacecraft.
   Although no decision was made regarding a rescue attempt, NASA
officials are ``obviously showing some interest,'' Herring said.
   The uninsured $150 million communications satellite was launched
by a Titan 3 booster rocket March 14 from Cape Canaveral, Fla., but
wound up in the wrong orbit after failing to separate properly from
the second stage of the rocket.
   Intelsat engineers managed to separate the satellite and later
boost it to a higher parking orbit using computer commands.
   The Intelsat VI satellite is whirling uselessly about 276 miles
above Earth, 22,000 miles lower than it should be.
   ``They're comfortable where it is,'' at least for now, Herring
said.
   Herring said NASA and officials from the two companies discussed
the possibility of attaching a motor to the spacecraft that would
boost it to where it should be. Such an attempt would require a
spacewalk by astronauts to draw the satellite into the shuttle's
payload bay, he said.
   ``While the discussions were very preliminary, no insurmountable
technical issues were identified,'' NASA said in a statement.
   Thursday's meeting ``was devoted to fact-finding only and no
decisions were made as to whether such a mission could be
accomplished,'' the space agency said. ``Additional meetings are
being planned to further discuss aspects of the Intelsat VI status
and rescue options.''
   William Reeves, lead flight director for next month's trip by
the shuttle Discovery to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, said
there were no plans to incorporate any rescue attempt in the
five-day mission.
   Martin Marietta Corp., which launched the rocket and satellite
at a cost of $270 million, has blamed the failure on a design
error. It was Martin Marietta's second commercial launch of a
payload into orbit and the fourth by an American company.
   The Intelsat VI satellite was intended to transmit three TV
channels and up to 120,000 telephone calls simultaneously for more
than 13 years. Intelsat, a not-for-profit international consortium,
operates a global communications satellite system.

<HEAD>Stock Rebounds, Dollar Rises Further Against Yen in Tokyo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KOZO MIZOGUCHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange bounced back Friday, one
day after a hectic sell-off pushed the market's main index to its
lowest close in 15 months.
   The dollar kept rising against the yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
963.85 points Thursday, gained 528.82 points, or 1.77 percent, to
close the week at 30,372.16.
   Friday's advance followed a 2,773.1-point decline in the Nikkei
index in three previous trading days this week. There was no
trading on Wednesday because of a national holiday.
   ``The stock market is gradually recovering, and individual
investors have begun bargain-hunting for issues at low share
prices,'' said Kumiko Takahashi, a dealer with Nikko Securities.
   In foreign exchange, the U.S. currency ended the week at 155.07
yen, up 0.24 yen from Thursday's close of 154.83 yen. After opening
at 154.75 yen, the currency ranged between 154.65 yen and 155.25
yen.
   Currency dealers have blamed the yen's weakness on the stock
market drop.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bond was
quoted higher at 86.61 points as of 3 p.m., up from Thursday's
close at 86.54 points. Its yield slid to 7.220 percent from 7.235
percent the previous day.
   Many institutional investors remained on the sidelines awaiting
account settlement for fiscal 1989, which ends March 31, dealers
said.
   The Nikkei fell 963.85 points, or 3.13 percent, to 29,843.34 on
Thursday, its lowest close since it ended at 29,741.28 on Dec. 24,
1988. It was the fourth biggest decline so far this year, in which
the market has plunged more than 20 percent.
   The dollar-yen rate moved narrowly before a weekend meeting
between Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and U.S.
Secretary of Treasury Nicholas Brady in Los Angeles, said Minori
Takeuchi, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   Hashimoto said Friday he was ``extremely concerned'' about the
current levels of the yen and Tokyo share prices. He said an
international accord for cooperation on exchange rates must be
reconfirmed at his meeting with Brady.
   News reports that the Bank of Japan and the Finance Ministry
began intervening the stock and currency markets accelerated market
players' fears that the situation could seriously damage Japan's
economy.
   Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic daily, reported
Friday that the Finance Ministry has requested securities houses to
limit certain activities in an attempt to prevent excessive market
declines.
   Analysts said the stock market's tumble on Thursday stemmed from
heavy selling by institutional investors who were desperate to
offset earlier losses or cash-out losing positions before closing
their books for the fiscal year ending March 31.
   Thursday's drop brought the Nikkei's losses so far this year to
9,072.53 points, or 23 percent.
   Dealers blamed the market pessimism on the yen's continuing
depreciation against the dollar, despite the Bank of Japan's
increase in the discount rate.
   The central bank on Tuesday raised the key rate by 1 percentage
point to 5.25 percent in an effort to stem inflation and support
the yen. But analysts said delays in the long-anticipated increase
had destabilized Japan's financial markets.

<HEAD>Senate Urges Soviets to Stop Intimidation of Lithuania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate is calling on the Soviet Union to
stop intimidating Lithuania, and is warning that the use of
military force ``would have severe repercussions for U.S.-Soviet
relations.''
   A resolution approved 93-0 late Thursday also urged President
Bush to consider the Lithuanian government's request for diplomatic
recognition. The day before, a resolution urging the president to
grant such recognition had been defeated 59-36.
   ``The Soviet Union has no right to use force against Lithuanians
peacefully exercising their democratic rights,'' declared Thursday
night's resolution, which is not binding but indicates ``a sense of
Congress.''
   It said Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and other Soviet
leaders ``should clearly understand that the use of force against
the Lithuanian people would have severe repercussions for
U.S.-Soviet relations.''
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., sponsor of the resolution that lost
Wednesday night, chastised his colleagues for sending ``mixed
signals,''saying there was little difference between his resolution
and the one that passed unanimously.
   But Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who voted against Helms'
resolution, said he favored the newer resolution because it ``gives
greater flexibility to the president.''
   While the approved resolution urged Bush to consider the request
from the Lithuanian government for recognition, it did not urge the
president specifically to grant it, as did Helms' resolution.
   Earlier in the day two House Republicans, Reps. William
Broomfield of Michigan and Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, introduced a
resolution warning that any Soviet crackdown on Lithuania would be
met by U.S. trade sanctions.
   The House did not vote on the resolution.

   The coroner called the young Menominee
Indian's death suicide. Tribal medicine men who invoked the
victim's spirit said it was accidental. But a protracted FBI
investigation has fueled rumors of foul play.
   Jeffery Cloud, 20, died of a pistol shot to the head Nov. 22.
His body was found in a pickup truck owned by Apesanahkwat, then
tribal chairman. The .357-caliber pistol was taken from
Apesanahkwat's home that day.
   Apesanahkwat's teen-age daughter, who was Cloud's girlfriend and
says she was the lone witness to the suicide, has refused to take a
lie-detector test, the tribal police chief says, though her father
denies that.
   Menominee County Coroner Rick Herrera says he ruled Cloud's
death a suicide, without talking to Apesanahkwat's daughter,
because of evidence he found at the scene.
   ``When it was obvious like that, we don't do an autopsy,''
Herrera said.
   Apesanahkwat (pronounced ah-peh-SAHN-eh-kwat) said Cloud's
spirits were contacted in an Indian religious ceremony two weeks
after his death, and tribal medicine men are convinced the shooting
was accidental, not a suicide.
   ``He didn't realize there were bullets in the gun. That is
almost a direct quote that was interpreted to me by the medicine
men,'' Apesanahkwat said.
   The FBI, meanwhile, says it is continuing its investigation but
won't say why. The agency has jurisdiction to investigate felonies
on the reservation.
   That has stirred questions on the Menominee nation's reservation
of about 3,000 people, 45 miles northwest of Green Bay in
east-central Wisconsin.
   Apesanahkwat, who decided two months after the death not to seek
a fourth one-year term as tribal chairman, acknowledged he has
heard rumors that he is a suspect and that Cloud witnessed some
kind of drug deal before dying.
   He called the rumors ``totally groundless and ridiculous.''
   The former tribal chief, known as Melvin Chevalier before he
switched to his Indian name several years ago, is a 41-year-old
Vietnam war veteran, actor and Indian lobbyist. He says he has no
idea why the FBI is keeping the case open.
   Tribal Police Chief Kenneth Paddo Fish said the FBI continues
investigating because 16-year-old Bernadette Chevalier, whose
Indian name is Waupanoh, has refused to take a lie-detector test.
FBI agent Tom Martin of Green Bay would neither confirm nor deny
that.
   Waupanoh (pronounced wau-PAH-nah) said in an interview last
week, ``I know what happened. He (Cloud) knows what happened. The
Great Spirit knows what happened.''
   But in a news conference Thursday, Apesanahkwat disputed that
his daughter refused to take the test. He said the FBI had
requested the test, but a technician who was going to administer it
told his wife that his daughter was too upset to take it.
   Apesanahkwat said there was no further need for her to take a
test.
   Cloud's mother, Isabel, 47, refuses to believe her son committed
suicide.
   ``He had a lot of things going for him,'' she said last week.
   A high school dropout, Cloud was a ``happy-go-lucky'' guy who
would ``boogie'' to avoid trouble, his mother said.
   Miss Chevalier said that on the night he died, Cloud, her
boyfriend for nearly two years, and she had argued and he went into
the tribal chairman's home and grabbed a gun. The gun belonged to
one of Apesanahkwat's friends, Apesanahkwat said.
   Cloud started walking away, alone, and Miss Chevalier said she
jumped into her father's pickup after him, crying and asking him to
come back.
   Cloud got into the vehicle. At some point, she said, he put the
gun to the left side of his head, she tried to pull it away and it
went off. Frantic, she drove back to her home, where investigators
found the body in the truck.
   He had been depressed, unhappy with his life and cried about it,
she said. ``He had said, `One of these days I am going to take a
walk and I am not going to come back.'''
   Ms. Cloud said her son loved Waupanoh but had other girlfriends.
``To kill himself over a girl, why should he, when he had all these
other girls?'' she said.
   ``I just lay back and in my prayers for my son I tell him,
`Someone is going to get paid back for what they did to you if
anybody did that to you.' That is what I keep telling myself,'' she
said.

<TEXT>
   He is not as notorious as Captain Bligh
or Captain Ahab, but Captain Joseph Hazelwood, former skipper of
the Exxon Valdez, has sailed unwillingly into America's lore of the
sea.
   While cartoonists sketched him as a liquor-swigging villain and
TV comics parodied the infamous grounding of his ship, the
passionately private Hazelwood returned to Alaska this winter,
nearly a year after the nation's worst oil spill, determined to
clear his name.
   ``I'd like to get rid of the misconception that I got drunk, ran
the ship aground and just shrugged my shoulders and walked away,
because that's just not what happened,'' he said after the
grounding of the Exxon Valdez had tarred his reputation along with
hundreds of miles of rocky shore.
   On Thursday, a jury found Hazelwood innocent of the most serious
charges against him, convicting him only of a misdemeanor charge of
negligent discharge of oil. He faces up to 90 days in jail and a
$1,000 fine.
   He was acquitted of charges of second-degree criminal mischief,
reckless endangerment and operating a vessel while intoxicated.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., was the only person charged
criminally in the environmental calamity. He was accused of being
drunk on duty and being away from the ship's bridge when it rammed
a charted reef.
   He came back to Alaska with some trepidation and kept a low
profile outside court. Many nights he stayed in his hotel room
watching old movies about sea captains rather than risk being
recognized in public.
   In court, the balding, bearded Hazelwood sat mute, watching in
stoic silence as his crew members told their stories.
   His demeanor was not unusual. Joe Hazelwood had always been a
man of few words.
   ``His actions always spoke louder than his words because his
words were not that many,'' said attorney Michael Chalos,
Hazelwood's former maritime college classmate who put together his
defense team just days after the Exxon Valdez grounding made
headlines.
   In school, says Chalos, the low key Hazelwood was ``a natural
leader ... very quiet but very determined.''
   He was captain of the lacrosse team and did well academically,
Chalos recalls, but was something of a rebel when it came to
military authority. His rebelliousness later would bring him into
conflict with Exxon executives over company policies.
   When he graduated from New York State University Maritime
College at Fort Schyler, Hazelwood signed on with Exxon Shipping
Corp.
   ``It was a plum appointment,'' recalls Chalos. ``If you got a
job with Exxon, you'd made it.''
   He rose in the seagoing ranks, obtained his master's license,
won the fleet award for efficiency in 1986 and, in 1987, was given
command of the brand new Exxon Valdez, the most advanced, high-tech
vessel in the Exxon fleet.
   He rarely spent more than three or four months at a time ashore.
But between voyages he returned to Huntington where he and his
wife, Suzanne, live with their teen-age daughter, Alison.
   ``I get stark crazy when I am too far from the salt water,'' he
has said.
   If there was a fatal flaw in Hazelwood's smooth history of
achievements, it was his drinking. He lost his New York motor
vehicle driver's license after two drunken driving convictions and
in 1985, with Exxon's knowledge, he went through a 28-day voluntary
alcohol rehabilitation program.
   Was he drunk aboard the Exxon Valdez on the fateful night? His
crew members testified they saw no signs of intoxication although
they had seen the captain put away a few drinks in town.
   His blood alcohol reading was .061 in a test taken 10{ hours
after the grounding. Evidence was inconclusive on what his blood
alcohol was earlier.
   Hazelwood, true to his taciturn nature, chose not to testify and
never commented on the intoxication issue.
   Why didn't he testify? Attorneys said they were confident about
their case and did not want to subject Hazelwood to unnecessary,
grueling cross-examination. They had another reason, too.
   ``Sitting here at the defense table, he's still the captain,
someone special,'' said Chalos. ``If he had gotten up on the
witness stand, he wouldn't be special anymore. He'd be just another
witness.''

   Here is a chronology of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, its cleanup
and related developments:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>1989</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   March 24: The 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez runs aground on Bligh
Reef some 25 miles south of Valdez, Alaska, spilling nearly 11
million gallons of North Slope crude oil into Prince William Sound.
   March 26: Alaska fishermen's union spokeswoman Riki Ott says the
group wants full compensation for damage from the spill. More than
250 lawsuits will be filed against Exxon in the following months.
   March 30: Exxon fires tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood after
tests reveal he was legally drunk 10 hours after the accident.
   April 4: U.S. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan calls the spill
the oil industry's ``Three Mile Island.'' Oil now covers 1,000
square miles, leaking out of the sound to foul beaches along the
Gulf of Alaska and Cook Inlet.
   June 19: Exxon and other big oil companies announce plans for a
voluntary network of response teams capable of handling big spills
anywhere in U.S. coastal waters. Estimated cost: $250 million.
   Sept. 15: Exxon suspends its beach cleanup for the winter,
claiming it has left 1,100 miles of oiled beaches ``environmentally
stable'' and saying its 25-week cleanup involving more than 10,000
workers was a job well done. Alaska officials disagree and announce
their own $21 million winter cleanup plan.
   Oct. 10: State officials warn people not to consume shellfish in
areas affected by oil.
   Oct. 27: The National Wildlife Federation says Exxon has
resigned from its corporate advisory board. Exxon calls the
conservation group unfair in its criticism of the oil spill; the
group calls Exxon ``a corporate pariah.''
   Nov. 8: The U.S. House of Representatives passes a bill
preserving states' ability to adopt stricter oil spill liability
laws than the federal government. The Senate also is working on a
bill, but agreement is put off until 1990.
   Dec. 4: U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says
Exxon's cleanup has cost the company $1.9 billion, and praises
Exxon for ``a very substantial, good-faith effort.''
   Dec. 31: Wildlife officials report that more than 1,000 sea
otters, 140 bald eagles and nearly 36,500 seabirds have been found
dead in the spill area.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>1990</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jan. 5: The Alaska Oil Spill Commission issues a report calling
for an overhaul of the nation's oil transportation system. It
blames the Valdez spill in part on the Coast Guard's ``unduly
friendly relationship with industry,'' and a reckless rush to
profits by the oil industry.
   Jan. 22: Hazelwood goes on trial in Anchorage, facing charges of
criminal mischief, reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of
oil, and operating a vessel while intoxicated.
   Feb. 20: The Coast Guard orders Exxon to resume its cleanup May
1 and to submit a plan by March 15.
   Feb. 27: A federal grand jury indicts Exxon and its shipping
subsidiary on five criminal counts. Officials say that if convicted
on all counts, the company could be fined up to $1.6 million and
could be assessed an additional $700 million in penalties.
   March 21 _ Hazelwood case submitted to jury.
   March 22 _ Jury finds Hazelwood guilty of negligent discharge of
oil but innocent of the more serious charges.

Joseph Hazelwood of the most serious charges against him said there
was no proof that alcohol played a role in the Exxon Valdez oil
spill.
   And while there was considerable debate about the maxim that a
captain is responsible for his ship, jurors said they were forced
to recognize that the law doesn't say so.
   ``In fact, that caused some difficult times while we were in
there,'' said juror Terrill Smith. ``We considered the fact that
Hazelwood was captain of his ship and the actions of his crew.
   ``But when it come down to making a verdict, we could not say
that because that was not the law.''
   Smith said he and the other jurors based their decision on the
law and evidence, and ``the state just didn't have the evidence.''
   Asked who then was responsible for spilling nearly 11 million
gallons of North Slope crude oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound
last March, Smith said: ``I don't know. I can't answer that. The
only gentleman who was on trial was Captain Hazelwood.''
   Hazelwood, acquitted of charges of drunkenness and recklessness,
faces a possible fine of $1,000 and 90 days in jail on the
misdemeanor count of negligent discharge of oil.
   Smith and juror Jeff Sage said the state could not prove that
alcohol played a role because authorities failed to give Hazelwood
a blood alcohol test until 10{ hours after the grounding.
   Sage said he did not buy the prosecution's effort to prove
Hazelwood was intoxicated through backward calculations starting
from his alcohol blood level when tested _ a level well below the
Alaska standard for drunken highway drivers.
   ``We all agreed. It was obvious in court that he had had
something to drink prior to'' the grounding, Smith said. ``But with
the time involved,'' it was not possible to determine beyond a
reasonable doubt that alcohol played a role.
   Smith faulted the Alaska laws under which Hazelwood was
prosecuted, saying, ``I think that there needs to be a long hard
look taken at a lot of the laws pertaining to the navigational
waters of our state.''
   He did not elaborate.
   Sage said he felt the jury rendered the only decision possible
under the law.
   ``It's been a privilage. I'm glad to stand here today and say
that justice has been done,'' Sage said.
   Smith and Sage said the jury believed that Hazelwood's decision
to leave the bridge shortly before the tanker hit a charted reef
was not reckless as the state contended, but only negligent.
   Thus, the jury had no problem convicting him on the misdemeanor
charge of negligent discharge of oil, Smith said.
   Sage he said he thought Third Mate Gregory Cousins and Helmsman
Robert Kagan probably were not the right team to leave on the
bridge when Hazelwood went below.
   But Smith noted that Hazelwood apparently felt the ship was in
competent hands.
   Sage also criticized the Coast Guard monitoring system for
failing to warn the Exxon Valdez that it was nearing a reef after
it changed course to avoid floating ice.
   ``It's a joke,'' Sage said. ``Seventy million bucks. What did
they spend it on? They're there to avoid collisions and
groundings.''
   According to testimony, the Coast Guard radar monitor said the
Exxon Valdez disappeared from radar at some point before the
disaster.
   The jury did not feel Hazelwood was a scapegoat for Exxon and
political forces, as the defense argued, Smith said.
   However, he added, ``Personally, I felt there was a possibility
that may have been happening.''

<HEAD>Maryland Voters May Decide Abortion Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM STUCKEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Maryland Senate today approved an unusual
plan, passing both an anti-abortion bill and an abortion rights
bill and giving the state's voters a chance to decide which should
become law.
   Acceptance of the two-bill plan shortly after midnight broke an
eight-day filibuster in the Senate, where abortion rights forces
had the 24 votes needed to pass a liberal abortion law but were one
vote shy of the 32 required to end debate.
   Under the compromise that Senate leaders worked out, the
abortion rights bill permitting unrestricted abortions during the
early stages of pregnancy will become law unless it is petitioned
to referendum and rejected by voters in November.
   If that happens, then the bill sponsored by anti-abortion
senators will become law _ unless it also is defeated by voters.
   Leaders on both sides of the issue in the House said after the
compromise was revealed Thursday that they would have to look at
the two bills before deciding whether they could accept them.
   The measures are structured so that both would have to be passed
by the House of Delegates and signed by the governor; if one of the
measures is rejected, the other one dies.
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer's spokeswoman, Louise Hayman, said
the governor would not comment on whether he would sign or veto the
bills.
   ``It is paternalistic, patronizing, demeaning and degrading to
women,'' Sen. Barbara Hoffman said of the anti-abortion bill.
   Sen. Vernon Boozer said if the anti-abortion bill becomes law,
``it would seriously impair the health and welfare of the women of
this state.''
   The only response from anti-abortion senators came from Norman
Stone, who said he considered the abortion rights bill ``the worst
bill that has ever come before this body.''
   Under the anti-abortion bill, before the fetus is viable, or
capable of living outside the womb, abortions could be performed in
cases of rape or incest, to protect the mother's life or if the
pregnancy would produce serious and adverse effects on the woman's
health. After viability, abortions could be performed only to save
the mother's life.
   The abortion rights bill would allow unrestricted access to
abortions until viability. After that, it would permit abortions to
protect the mother's life or health.
   Anti-abortion groups have already formed a committee to collect
signatures to put an abortion rights bill on the ballot if one is
passed and signed by the governor, in hopes of defeating it in a
referendum.
   Pro-choice lobbyists said they were unsure what they would do if
the two-bill package is accepted by the House and signed by the
governor.

<HEAD>Darman Asks Senators to Help Launch Deficit-Reduction Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's budget chief is appealing to
21 mostly junior senators for help in finding a way to get
deficit-reduction talks started between the White House and
congressional leaders.
   The bipartisan group of lawmakers gave a favorable reception to
Budget Director Richard Darman's plea Thursday, but Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., dismissed the meeting.
   Sasser, who did not attend, predicted there would be no serious
talks unless the administration expressed willingness to make deep
cuts in the budget.
   Darman has been trying unsuccessfully to persuade congressional
leaders to begin deficit-reduction talks since Bush released his
fiscal 1991 budget proposal in January. He launched his latest
offensive two weeks ago after Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
unveiled a plan to raise taxes and cut spending to save $512
billion over the next five years.
   Sasser is one of several top senators, including Majority Leader
George Mitchell of Maine, who have had poor relations with the
budget director since last fall, when disagreements over
deficit-cutting erupted.
   Sasser said he has not had a conversation with Darman since.
   Various congressional budget writers regarded Darman's visit as
an attempt to mend fences or to pressure Senate leaders to come to
the table.
   The budget director said the lawmakers with whom he met
expressed ``some sense of frustration'' with the deficit-reduction
efforts of the congressional budget committees.
   ``It's not clear they will be able to produce anything
substantive,'' he said.
   Darman came to Capitol Hill after being invited to appear before
a bipartisan group of senators who meet informally to discuss
budget problems.
   ``There is an intense desire to do more'' about deficit
reduction, said the group's leader, Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., who
when elected in 1986 promised to only seek a second term if the
federal budget deficit were under control.
   Darman told lawmakers it will probably take $45 billion to $50
billion in deficit reductions to reduce next year's projected
shortfall to $64 billion because the economy weakened late last
year.
   The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law requires the deficit be
reduced to $64 billion next year.
   Sasser said that for serious deficit-reduction talks to occur,
the administration ``would have to make a presentation that they'd
be interested in getting $50 billion in hard deficit reduction that
would persist.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee is urging
President Bush to intensify efforts to win freedom for American
hostages in Lebanon.
   The measure unanimously approved Thursday was sponsored by Rep.
Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., who asked Congress to pass a bill
requiring Bush to appoint a special envoy to work for the hostages'
freedom.
   But the administration and some members of Congress said the
appointment of such an envoy would confuse efforts already under
way to free the captives.
   As amended, the resolution says the president should
``accelerate efforts to secure the immediate and unconditional
release of the hostages'' through increased diplomatic efforts.
   Additionally, Bush should urge multinational efforts to work for
the hostages' release, the resolution said. The measure now goes to
the full House.
   Eight Americans are among the 18 Westerners held hostage in
Lebanon. They are thought to be guarded by pro-Iranian Moslem
Shiites.
   Terry Anderson, the longest-held American hostage, marked the
end of his fifth year in captivity on March 16. He is a
correspondent for The Associated Press.

<HEAD>Commerce Department Issues Ban on Capture of Bottlenose Dolphins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has ordered a ban on
the capture of bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico as
scientists try to determine the reason for more than 190 dolphin
deaths this year.
   Dozens of dolphins have been stranded and died since Jan. 1 in
five Gulf States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration _ 118 in Texas, 40 to 45 on the barrier islands of
Louisiana and Mississippi, 21 in the Alabama-Florida panhandle, and
10 in Florida's Tampa Bay.
   The dolphins have been stranded at four to five times the usual
rate for the time of year and the deaths are continuing, a NOAA
spokesman said.
   NOAA announced a halt in dolphin captures late Wednesday, to
remain in effect through at least June 15.
   William W. Fox Jr., NOAA's assistant administrator for
fisheries, said the National Marine Fisheries Service retains the
option to extend the ban.
   Although cold weather is believed responsible for the deaths of
26 dolphins in Texas' Matagorda Bay, the NOAA spokesman said ``this
thing could involve a number of reasons.''
   Adult dolphins have been the victims, but scientists in the past
week or so have begun watching to assess how the calving season,
which began during the second week of March and goes into April,
will be affected.
   Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, bottlenose dolphins are
considered a protected, but not endangered or threatened, species.
   According to NOAA, 11 organizations hold permits to collect live
dolphins, but only three do the actual collecting. The dolphins can
be taken for educational purposes such as aquariums or marine-type
theaters.

<HEAD>US-South Korea Sign Agreement To Phase Out Tariffs, Quotas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea will phase out all quotas and
tariffs on American beef entering the country, according to Sen.
Phil Gramm.
   Gramm, R-Texas, said the agreement sets up a three-year
``transition period'' in which current American sales to South
Korea, which are running at 63,900 tons, would grow to 68,300 tons
this year and 72,800 tons next year.
   Gramm said the agreement signed Thursday by U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills and South Korean officials ``sets out
procedures to eliminate all quotas and tariffs on American beef
going into Korea.''
   ``This is another major step toward opening the world market to
the joys of eating American beef,'' Gramm said.
   Gramm said he believed the agreement, which was not immediately
announced by the trade representative's office, would vastly
increase demand in Korea for beef, which has been kept artificially
high due to quotas and tariffs.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE M.V. ASHLAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Co. wants its towboat
crews free of alcohol so the company is checking them for
drunken-driving arrests to help avert pollution and
public-relations disasters like the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
   ``There's no place for alcohol on a boat. It's too dangerous,''
said Mary Hale, a cook aboard the Ashland, a towboat working the
Ohio and Mississippi rivers.
   For pilots and crew members, alcohol is more dangerous than the
eight barges of gasoline, diesel and crude oil they were pushing on
a recent Ohio River run from Kenova, W.Va., to Louisville, Ky.
   The only alcohol aboard is in medicine cabinets.
   ``You have to recognize danger while you still have time to do
something about it,'' said Skip Muscovalley, one of the Ashland's
captains.
   ``If we have the tiniest mistake, our jobs and lives are at
stake,'' Muscovalley said. ``If you sink a grain barge or a coal
barge, well, it happens and you just go on. Sink one of these dudes
and you make the news. You're the new Joe Hazelwood.''
   Hazelwood, 43, a veteran mariner from Huntington, N.Y., was
captain of the Exxon Valdez when the tanker ran aground and spilled
nearly 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound
a year ago Saturday. It was the nation's worst oil spill.
   A state jury in Anchorage acquitted Hazelwood on Thursday of
criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and operating a vessel
while intoxicated. But the jury convicted him of negligent
discharge of oil, which carries a maximum sentence of 90 days in
jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Authorities said a review of Hazelwood's driving record
uncovered two drunken-driving arrests and three license suspensions.
   Ashland Oil officials thought reviewing its pilots' driving
records might find trouble spots before the company suffers a
waterborne accident of its own.
   ``We found a few people with DUIs in their history,'' said Zane
Meek, Ashland's administrator of marine transportation. ``We told
them our side of the story and told them we didn't want to see any
kind of habit like that.''
   No pattern of abuse has developed and no one has been
disciplined, Meek said.
   ``We're not after someone who has one incident. Any of us could
have that occur,'' said John Joeckel, company manager of fleet
operations. ``We really are trying to keep this a non-punitive type
of program because we want people who think they have a problem to
come forward.''
   Skippers say crews welcome the checks and understand Ashland's
need to protect its investment on runs from Pennsylvania to
Louisiana to Texas.
   ``The cost of equipment has gone up and there's so much money
involved that they couldn't afford any problems on their boats,''
said Merle Adams, an Ashland skipper. ``The company is looking out
for its own welfare as well as your own.''
   Ashland crews have 30 days on and 30 days off. The tugboats run
24 hours a day and crew members alternate six-hour shifts, grabbing
sleep and meals in their time off.
   ``I know what to look for; any kind of strange behavior,'' said
David Smith, captain of the Valvoline, another vessel in Ashland's
fleet. ``We have 10 men on the boat ... If you work with the same
men for a month, you know if they're acting differently.''

   Environmentalists and public officials
said they were disappointed a jury absolved Joseph Hazelwood of
most charges in the nation's worst oil spill, and vowed not to let
the oil industry off the hook.
   ``The whole system is culpable and Exxon and Hazelwood are just
two agents in a very complicated and very flawed system of
extraction and transportation of petroleum,'' said Mei Mei Evans,
coordinator of the Oil Reform Alliance, a group of residents
affected by the spill.
   Hazelwood was convicted Thursday of a misdemeanor charge of
negligent discharge of oil but acquitted of three other more
serious counts, including drunkenness and recklessness. He faces a
possible 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Exxon said the verdicts seemed to confirm the spill last year of
almost 11 million gallons of crude from the company's Exxon Valdez
tanker was an accident.
   But former Valdez Mayor John Devens said the issue never was
Hazelwood.
   ``There will always be Joe Hazelwoods,'' Devens said. The spill
showed that industry does not have the technology to deal with oil
spills of that magnitude, and that prevention must be stressed, he
said.
   ``The real issue confronting the state of Alaska is whether
industry is prepared to prevent another oil spill,'' Devens said.
   The state filed a civil lawsuit against Exxon on Aug. 15,
joining more than 150 other civil litigants.
   ``The result bears out the fact that there are other people
responsible for this, other than Capt. Hazelwood,'' Gov. Steve
Cowper said.
   Exxon officials in New York reacted with apparent optimism
following the verdict.
   ``We are pleased that the ordeal of the trial is over for Capt.
Hazelwood and his family. The verdict would seem to confirm the
view that the grounding of the Exxon Valdez was an accident,'' said
Exxon spokesman Jim Morakis.
   ``In light of pending litigation any other comment would be
inappropriate,'' the company said.
   In Juneau, Alaska Attorney General Douglas Baily said that he
was pleased with the verdict, which he said should not have any
major effect on pending civil and criminal cases against Exxon.
   ``I suppose in an ideal world we would have preferred to have
been more successful on some of the other counts,'' Baily said.
``But we certainly accept the jury's verdict.''
   But Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole, who argued the case,
said he was disappointed and remains convinced that Hazelwood was
drunk when the ship ran aground.
   Defense attorney Dick Madson said the defense plans to appeal on
grounds that federal law preempts state law concerning oil spills
and that a person who reports an oil spill, as Hazelwood did, is
immune from prosecution.
   Marnie Isaacs, spokeswoman for Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the
consortium of oil companies that run the trans-Alaska pipeline,
said, ``Many, many factors contributed to the grounding of the
Valdez, in addition to the actions of the captain.''
   The Hazelwood verdicts are only the beginning of determining
responsibility for the disaster, some environnmentalists said.
   Bruce Manheim, spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund in
Washington, D.C., said, ``We're certainly disappointed with that
result but, nonetheless, we believe the real trial has yet to
begin.''

   Both babies were boys.
   Each weighed 7 pounds, 9 ounces.

   In the next room, at 4:19 a.m., Mrs. Plante delivered Thomas

   Her friends and relatives joke that at

she climbed to the peak of a mountain _ 10 times.
   ``I thought of a half-marathon or a cruise, but I thought this
would be more fun,'' Ms. Swindle said after completing her eighth
trip up a rocky 1{-mile trail to the summit of Pinnacle Mountain.
   The climb began 5:45 a.m. Wednesday, part of her tradition of
climbing the west summit trail at Pinnacle Mountain State Park at
sunrise.
   Each time the Hot Springs woman returned to the base, more
friends or relatives had arrived, some from as far away as San

   They set up camp complete with a decorated picnic table,
scrapbook and a dozen roses placed in a cooking grill.
   Nearby, a white sheet was strung between two trees with balloons
and messages from well-wishers.
   ``It's all downhill from here,'' one note said.
   ``You're nowhere near your peak,'' said another.
   Ms. Swindle's mother, Patsy Swindle, was busy taking
photographs. She said the climb is typical of her daughter.
   ``I'm not surprised, I just thought 10 times was a bit too
much,'' she said. ``But I'm real proud of her.''
   She began training in January and decided to try and climb
Pinnacle 40 times by her birthday. She made it 43 times _ the last
10 climbs taking her 12 hours.
   She hasn't made plans for her next birthday.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange bounced
back today for its first gain this week, while the dollar moved
higher against the yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
963.85 points Thursday, gained 528.82 points, or 1.77 percent, to
close the week at 30,372.16.
   The leading index had fallen 2,773.1 points during the three
previous trading days this week. The stock market was closed
Wednesday because of a national holiday.
   Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 600
million shares, up from 580 million shares on Thursday.
   The Nikkei index fell in early morning trading because of
profit-taking by institutional investors, securities dealers said.
   But the index rose sharply toward end of the day, with stock
futures being bought back, in part because of a series of buy
orders by arbitrageurs, they said. Arbitrageurs profit from price
differentials between the futures and spot markets.
   ``The market is slowly but gradually recovering, helped by
relative stability in the currency and bond markets,'' said Akira
Shimoda, an equity analyst with Yamaichi Securities.
   Shomoda said the Finance Ministry's approval Thursday of a
measure that allows Japan's four major brokerage houses to handle
more than 30 percent of the purchase orders of any particular stock
in a month would ``greatly help'' activities at the securites firms
and strengthen the market.
   Japan's four major securities firms _ Nomura Securitiies, Daiwa
Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities _ had asked
the Finance Ministry to ease the restriction, a rule set up to
check insider trading, he said.
   The four securities firms account for about half of the market's
total turnover, a market analyst said.
   In the foreign currency market, the dollar closed the week at
155.07 yen, up 0.24 yen from Thursday's close of 154.83 yen. After
opening at 154.75 yen, the U.S. currency ranged between 154.65 yen
and 155.25 yen.
   ``The demand for the dollar basically remains strong,'' said
Toshio Takahashi, a dealer with the Industrial Bank of Japan. ``The
American economy is good, despite cautiousness over inflation''
among U.S. monetary authorities, he said.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was to leave later today for
a weekend meeting focusing on exchange-rate movements with Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady in Los Angeles.
   Hashimoto told a parliamentary budget committee session today
that he will seek U.S. cooperation in keeping currencies stable
within the framework of policy coordination among the Group of
Seven major industrialized countries.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bonds closed
at 86.97, up from Thursday's 86.54. The yield fell to 7.145 percent
from 7.235 percent the previous day.

times, and suggested they come to Montana to make preparations for
a possible nuclear war or accident.
   The influx has meant a boom for area contractors building
fallout shelters for church members in the scenic mountain valley
just north of Yellowstone National Park.
   But it also has led to an increased demand for telephone service
that has overloaded the valley's antiquated central telephone
system.
   ``We have had in the last month some rapid and unexpected growth
in the Paradise Valley,'' said Crystal Shors, spokeswoman for US
West Communications. ``It's basically exhausted the call-switching
capability'' of the system.
   The church sponsors two housing developments at Emigrant in
southwestern Montana, where Park County officials say as many as 45
private underground fallout shelters exist. Officials said in
January that about 500 people lived at the developments, and that
the numbers have increased since then.
   Shors said new telephone equipment will be installed within two
weeks to improve service, but that a more complete system will not
be ready until fall.
   And while Barnes worries about losing summer reservations
because of problems with the telephone lines, that doesn't mean his
business has hard feelings for Church Universal members.
   Some are even staying at the resort while they try to find a
place to live.
   ``We've always had the policy that everyone is welcome here,''
he said.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's candidate
suffered a spectacular defeat in a special parliamentary election,
losing a Conservative Party stronghold in a rebuke of a new tax and
high interest rates.
   The opposition Labor Party today rejoiced in seizing the
prosperous central England district of Mid-Staffordshire,
overturning a majority of more than 14,000 for the Conservatives'
worst loss in a special election in half a century.
   The Conservative loss Thursday was likely to renew speculation
that worried rank-and-file legislators might try to dump Mrs.
Thatcher as leader before the next general election, due by
mid-1992.
   Labor leader Neil Kinnock today called the victory
``monumental'' and said it marked a turning point for the
Conservatives who ``are going to have to make up their minds how
quickly they get rid of Mrs. Thatcher.''
   Labor candidate Sylvia Heal, a social worker, more than doubled
the party's votes from the last election in 1987 to win 49 percent
and a 9,449-vote plurality.
   ``There has been a significant change in attitude of the people
of this constituency and I believe of the country,'' Mrs. Heal told
cheering supporters.
   The Conservatives' Charles Prior got 33 percent and the centrist
Social and Liberal Democratic Party candidate 11 percent. The
remaining vote were scattered among the Greens, a splinter centrist
party and fringe candidates.
   The swing to Labor from the Conservatives was 21.33 percent,
with 77.5 percent of eligible voters casting ballots. Mrs. Heal
polled 27,649 votes, Prior 18,200 votes, and Social and Liberal
candidate Tim Jones, 6,315 votes. Eleven other candidates got a
total of 4,195 votes.
   The previous Conservative member of Parliament, who committed
suicide in December, won Mid-Staffordshire with 50 percent of the
vote in Britain's 1987 general election.
   ``This is a bad result,'' said Conservative Party chairman
Kenneth Baker. ``However, the government has had to take difficult
decisions over inflation and the economy.''
   Baker blamed the loss on protest votes cast against Mrs.
Thatcher's government and its new community charge tax.
   The tax, dubbed a poll tax and designed to replace property
taxes in financing local government, has caused ``temporary
unpopularity,'' he said. Under the tax, each district charges a set
amount per head regardless of income.
   A BBC survey Thursday night of the four latest opinion polls
showed Labor surged to a 21-point lead nationally. It was Labor's
biggest lead since Mrs. Thatcher came to power 11 years ago.
   A year ago, the Tories had a 10-point lead nationally.
   ``This is a stunning victory for Labor,''' said Jack Cunningham,
the party's campaign manager. ``It is a political landmark that
proves that Labor can win across Britain.''
   Thatcher aides had braced for defeat in Mid-Staffordshire, but
Labor's victory margin was wider than expected.
   Exit polls by Harris and National Opinion Poll said voters also
showed antipathy toward Mrs. Thatcher personally.
   Harris reported that 84 percent of defecting Conservatives said
Mrs. Thatcher should resign before the next general election and
National Opinion Poll said 38 percent wanted her to go.
   Cunningham said voters were ``absolutely fed up with Mrs.
Thatcher.''
   ``She is out of touch, she doesn't seem to understand their
problems ... and she doesn't seem to care,'' he said.
   The contest in the 71,200-voter constituency attracted national
attention as the first since nationwide rallies erupted against the
new tax.
   In what Labor Party members called an ``ignominious retreat,''
Mrs. Thatcher on Thursday extended poll tax rebates to Scotland,
where the tax was introduced a year ago.
   Another campaign issue was interest rates, which have doubled to
15 percent in under two years. The government is trying to curb
inflation with high interest rates, but with little success so far.
Inflation runs at 7.7. percent.
   The government is counting on a drop in inflation by early next
year so it can lower interest rates in time for the general
election.
   The Mid-Staffordshire district includes skilled blue-collar
workers who voted Conservative through the 80s and now have been
hit hard by high home loan rates.
   Despite the loss, Mrs. Thatcher kept overwhelming control of the
650-member House of Commons, where she has 374 seats and Labor has
229. The Social and Liberal Democrats have 19 seats, and the rest
are held by minority parties.

<HEAD>Rights Group: Violations at Worst Levels Since Early 1980s
^By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE
^Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Respect for human rights in the
war-ravaged nation has deteriorated to its lowest level since death
squads killed thousands in the early 1980s, a U.S. monitoring
organization reported.
   Americas Watch said in a 272-page report issued Thursday that
the deterioration underscores ``the failure of U.S. human rights
policy in El Salvador throughout the decade.''
   Washington has provided $3.8 billion in aid to El Salvador since
1980, but several U.S. congressmen have expressed reluctance to
continue the funding.
   The report contends there has been an increase in torture by
security forces, escalation of death-squad activity, assassination
of civilian officials by leftist rebels, indiscriminate use of
homemade guerrilla mortars and several instances of massacres by
government troops.
   The November offensive by fighters of the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, of FMLN, signalled the worsening in
human rights conditions, according to the report.
   ``The military crisis exacerbated tensions within the military
and thrust extremist elements to the fore. The rhetoric of high
officials reflected the charged intensity of the moment, and
spurred some units to engage in lawless actions. Targeted killings
by both the Armed Forces and the FMLN increased,'' it said.
   The report cites the Nov. 16 murder by army troops of six Jesuit
educators, their housekeeper and her daughter at Central American
University as cause ``to wonder at how little things have actually
changed in El Salvador.''
   A colonel, three lieutenants and four soldiers have been
arrested and charged in the Jesuit massacre.
   ``Despite limited progress in the prosecuttion of the Jesuit
case, there is a real danger that the true authors of crime may not
have been identified, and that the highest ranking officer
implicated so far will not be convicted or punished,'' said
Americas Watch, which is based in New York.
   Between 1980 and 1984, officially sponsored or tolerated
right-wing death squads killed up to 30,000 suspected leftists.
   ``While the numbers of targeted killings in recent years do not
approach the carnage of the early 1980s, the trend has not been
towards steady improvement,'' the report said.
   ``Moreover, declining numbers of political murders do not
indicate greater respect for human rights within the armed forces
or enhanced freedom to express political dissent. The level of
violence is still such that it is dangerous to express certain
views or maintain certain associations.''
   The report recalls the March 24, 1980 assassination of
Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero. Though evidence implicating
extreme rightists was compiled by the 1984-89 Christian Democratic
government, no one has been charged with involvement in that murder.
   ``The murder of Archbishop Romero in 1980 and the slaying of the
Jesuits in 1989 stand as bookends to the decade offering harsh
testimony about who really rules El Salvador and how little they
have changed. Ten years later, priest-killing is still a preferred
option for those who simply will not hear the cries for change and
justice in a society that has had too little of either,'' the
report said.

<HEAD>100,000 Deaths a Year From Alcohol, CDC Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials, while characterizing
alcohol abuse as a major health problem, say it's difficult to
determine how many drinks it takes to cause such diseases as cancer
or tuberculosis.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
its researchers used computer software to project how often various
causes of death are related to drinking. Then they projected the
loss of life _ and lost life-years _ from drinking.
   In 1987, the latest year for which projections are available,
105,095 Americans died either from drunken injury or diseases
linked to drinking.
   When the victims' life expectancy was figured in, alcohol robbed
them of more than 2.7 million years of life _ or about 26 years
each.
   The leading booze-related cause of death: injuries, chiefly in
drunken-driving crashes.
   Unintentional injuries related to alcohol killed 30,205
Americans in 1987, 29 percent of alcohol-related deaths. Second
were digestive diseases, including alcoholic cirrhosis of the
liver; they killed 19,556.
   ``This does not mean a problem for everyone who drinks,'' said
Dr. James Shultz of the University of Miami School of Medicine, the
lead researcher for the CDC report.
   He noted that tens of millions of persons drink, adding: ``So a
minority of those who drink have a fatal outcome.''
   But the deaths from booze _ nearly 300 a day _ mean that
``alcohol is a major problem,'' Shultz said. ``Now, it's for
policy-makers to assess that problem, and make determinations on
... appropriate policy.''
   Studies of alcohol-related sickness and death are subject to
much conjecture over ``who's in and who's out,'' and just what
``alcohol-related'' should mean _ binge drunkenness, heavy drinking
or even moderate, life-long drinking, Shultz said.
   Shultz's study used estimates from previous research for various
conditions: For example, mouth cancer deaths are believed
alcohol-related 50 percent of the time, and respiratory
tuberculosis deaths are alcohol-related 25 percent of the time.
   Even then, researchers disagree over the question of how much
drinking makes someone's death ``alcohol-related,'' and not simply
the natural death of someone who drank.
   But Shultz said most deaths from booze fall into two patterns:
sudden, violent deaths from a dangerous drunken episode, and
long-term, debilitating, heavy drinking that brings on disease.
   ``If we had everyone who drinks drinking very occasionally, at
levels not likely to produce injury-prone, dangerous behavior,
you'd have very few alcohol-related deaths,'' he said.
   The costs of alcohol-related deaths are high, the CDC said. In a
related report from Wisconsin health officials, the CDC reported
that 1,949 alcohol-related deaths occurred there in 1988, robbing
victims of 46,052 years of life and wreaking economic costs _ from
health care, police, lost productivity and other factors _ of $1.47
billion.

<HEAD>Mattox Presses Drug Claim Against Richards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Jim Mattox conceded he has
no proof, but said he still believes his opponent for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination, state Treasurer Ann Richards,
has used illegal drugs.
   In calls to several news organizations Thursday, Mattox again
raised the drug use question that Ms. Richards refused to answer in
the weeks before the March 13 primary.
   ``I do not believe that a person who takes the Fifth Amendment
can then go on and lead a war on drugs,'' Mattox said.
   The Richards campaign responded by producing the results of a
blood test Ms. Richards took last weekend in Austin. The results
were negative.
   Ms. Richards gathered the most votes in the primary, but not did
not get a majority. She will face Mattox in a runoff April 10.
   Before the primary, Ms. Richards said she has not taken
mood-altering substances since her release from a Minnesota alcohol
dependency program in 1980. She has said that to comment further
would discourage people who have recovered from drug and alcohol
problems from seeking office.
   In his media blitz Thursday, Mattox said of Ms. Richards: ``The
only logical question that always must be asked is `What kind of
things did you use before 1980? And where did you get them? How
often did you use them? Who supplied them to you?'''
   He told WOAI in San Antonio that he's ``not in doubt'' that Ms.
Richards has used illegal drugs.
   Richards' spokesman, Monte Williams, said the candidate took a
drug test last weekend in response to questions about Democratic
candidates' willingness to take such a test.
   Mattox has not taken a drug test, but a spokeswoman said he
would. Mattox has persistently said he has never taken illegal
drugs.

<HEAD>Fadlallah Speaks of `New' Hostage Situation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanon's most influential Shiite Moslem
cleric today spoke of a ``new situation'' regarding the fate of the
Western hostages held by pro-Iranian underground factions in
Lebanon.
   However, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the reputed spiritual
leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, said he had no
specific information about when any of the hostages might be freed.
   Most of the 18 Westerners missing are believed held by Shiite
Moslem groups loyal to Iran.
   A statement released by Fadlallah's office said the clergyman,
asked about the possibility of a hostage release in a radio
interview, replied: ``A new situation has emerged, but I don't know
when, how and where.''
   No further remarks on the issue were included in the release.
   Also today, the weekly magazine Ash-Shiraa said Fadlallah had
replied through an intermediary to questions from former President
Jimmy Carter on the issue.
   The story dealt with the hostages' whereabouts and the
possibility of releasing them, but gave no specific examples.
   Fadlallah visited Damascus during Carter's visit to the Syrian
capital earlier this month. Diplomatic sources have said the two
did not meet.
   Fadlallah said Feb. 23 that the issue of the Western captives
was being exploited to distort Islam's image and called for a
humanitarian approach to free them.
   His remarks echoed an earlier editorial in the English-language
Tehran Times newspaper in Iran, which often reflects the thinking
of President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   The past month has seen a series of contradictory statements
over the fate of the hostages, indicating a fight over the issue
within the Tehran government.
   Moderates led by Rafsanjani have said the hostage issue was
moving toward a solution, while radicals lead by Parliament member
Ali Mohammed Mohtashemi have encouraged the captors to hold onto
the hostages.
   The radicals are believed to hold more sway over the factions in
Lebanon actually holding the Westerners, with Hezbollah considered
an umbrella group for them.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, which holds two of the
eight American hostages, said in a statement March 7 no hostages
will be freed.
   Addressing Fadlallah, without referring to him by name, the
statement expressed sorrow over ``irresponsible declarations by
local friends'' to free the hostages.
   ``We call upon them (friends) to concentrate their humanitarian
attempts on areas that can be more positive,'' the statement added.
   Most of the hostages have been held for more than three years.
The longest-held is American Terry Anderson, the chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   In another report, Ash-Shiraa said alleged U.S.-Iranian
negotiations have ``reached their final stages after agreement was
reached on almost all topics, including the issue of the foreign
hostages. ''
   ``What's left is only carrying out the agreement according to
acceptable scenarios that would save face for Iran and guarantee
for Washington...its return to strategically vital Iran,'' said the
report, which cited no sources.
   Ash-Shiraa gained international recognition in 1987 for breaking
the story that the Reagan administration was trading arms for U.S.
hostages. However, its frequent reports over the past two years
that a hostage release was imminent have not proved accurate.
   Both Iran and the United States have denied a spate of recent
reports that they are negotiating directly on the hostage issue.

<TEXT>
   A jury found a man guilty of murdering his
11-year-old cousin, 33 years after the boy was found sodomized and
hanging from a clothesline.
   Richard Ruff, 53, was found guilty Thursday of murdering his
cousin, William Ruff Jr., on Aug. 31, 1957. The verdict ended what
authorities said was the longest unsolved homicide investigation in
state history.
   Ruff showed no emotion when the verdict was read. Mildred Ruff,
the victim's mother, sobbed quietly as she sat with family members
in court.
   ``Everything is at rest now and we'll be at peace,'' Ms. Ruff
said.
   Two medical witnesses for the prosecution said ``Billy'' Ruff
was sodomized and strangled before being hung from a clothesline
attached to a tree in a brush-covered lot near the family's
suburban Albany home.
   Richard Ruff, then in the Air Force, was home on leave at the
time of his cousin's death.
   In convicting Ruff of first-degree felony murder, the jury
concluded that he killed his cousin in the commission or the
attempted commission of sodomy.
   He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.
Judge Thomas W. Keegan set sentencing for April 19.
   Ruff is already serving a state prison sentence of four to 12
years for sexually molesting two girls in Hoosick Falls in
Rensselaer County.
   Ruff, who served on the Albany police force for several months
in 1958, was not a suspect in the unsolved murder until 1988. That
was when Christopher Ruff, the victim's brother, spotted a wanted
poster for Richard Ruff on the child sex abuse charges in Hoosick
Falls.
   Christopher Ruff, an Albany County sheriff's deputy, alerted
investigators. State police tracked Richard Ruff down in Orlando,
Fla., and he was returned to New York.
   ``Billy is in peace,'' said Christopher Ruff after the verdict.
   Public defender Joseph McCoy contended William Ruff Jr. was
hanged accidentally while swinging from a tree.
   McCoy said he will appeal the verdict.

<HEAD>Eighth Cabinet Minister Acknowledges Recruit Donations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An eighth member of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's
new Cabinet today acknowledged receiving donations from a company
at the center of an influence-buying scandal.
   ``I would like to make a sincere apology,'' said Takashi Fukaya,
the post and telecommunications minister, at a nationally televised
meeting of the upper house budget committee.
   Fukaya said his support group received more than $5,200 from
Recruit Co. over 3{ years until July 1988, when the scandal
surfaced. He also said his support group ``mistakenly'' continued
to receive Recruit money until that November but returned all
contributions made after August.
   Fukaya had earlier said he did not receive donations from
Recruit after July 1988. In a news conference last week, he
promised a further review of his records when asked about
allegations he received money after that summer.
   He said the ``inaccuracies'' resulted from ``my lack of
explanation, misunderstandings and insufficient communciation with
my office staff.''
   Twelve politicians, public officials and Recruit executives are
facing charges of bribery in connection with the Recruit stock
deals. Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita resigned to take
responsibility.
   The scandal contributed to a major election loss and cleared the
way for the rise of Kaifu, who took office with a clean image and
promises of political reforms but has since acknowledged receiving
$102,800 in Recruit donations.
   The information conglomerate offered thousands of cut-rate stock
shares to powerful lawmakers and business leaders before the shares
were listed for public sale. The company has also been criticized
for doling out millions of dollars in political donations.
   Kaifu today promised he will investigate whether Fukaya's
actions violated ethical guidelines, and said he will announce by
early April whether punishment is in order.
   At a parliamentary session in early March, Kaifu said he and six
other members of his new Cabinet had received donations from
Recruit.
   Kaifu said all of these ministers had received donations before
the Recruit scandal had surfaced.
   Though the statement followed numerous comments by the prime
minister that he would try to keep politicians tainted with Recruit
case or other scandals out of his administration, he has taken no
action against the ministers.
   The prime minister said Fukaya did not identify himself as a
recipient of donations from Recruit when he was choosing members of
his second Cabinet following a Feb. 18 election victory by the
governing Liberal Democratic Party.
   Meanwhile, Socialist Ryosuke Yasutsune demanded Kaifu comment on
a report by a mass-circulation weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun that
Kaifu had received $170,000 from Recruit.
   ``Why don't you take action, such as demanding Bunshun publish a
correction and apology, to gain the public understanding if the
story is false?'' said Yasutsune. ``I also want to remind you that
you should follow your predecessors and take responsibility in case
any new facts about you are revealed.''

   Part of the Berlin Wall, which was a symbol
of socialism and a barrier to capitalism for nearly three decades,
could be turned into a giant billboard.
   The East German advertising firm WuVA has acquired local
government rights to a 3,300-foot section of the Berlin Wall, the
newspaper Neues Deutschland said Thursday.
   Company chief Andreas Dademasch wants to paint the wall white
and recruit German companies to rent space on the structure, huge
sections of which already have been demolished by freedom lovers
and souvenir seekers.
   Some of the money would go to the city and posters advertising
such vices as cigarettes, alcohol or sex-related products would not
be allowed, he said.
   The wall, tightly guarded since East Germany erected it in 1961,
was opened in November after huge demonstrations forced hard-line
Communists from power.
   Dademasch said his plans for part of the wall would be
consistent with the trumpeting of capitalism by Christian
Democratic Union chief Lothar de Maziere, whose party leads an
alliance that won Sunday's election in East Germany.

<HEAD>Hong Kong to Ban Ivory Trade in July</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Hong Kong government today proposed to
outlaw trade in ivory in this British colony by July.
   Under legislation introduced today, the import or export of
ivory will be banned as part of an international agreement to save
Africa's elephants, whose population has dropped from 1.5 million
in the 1970s to about 600,000.
   Poachers kill the elephants for their tusks, which are used here
to make intricate ivory artwork.
   The proposal is open for public and legislative comments. If
passed, it will become law on July 17, said Mary Leung, spokeswoman
for the Agricultural and Fisheries Department.
   An international conference agreed in October to ban worldwide
trade in ivory from January. Hong Kong's ivory traders and carvers
condemned the decision, claiming it would destroy their livelihood.
   Hong Kong was eventually allowed a six-month delay on the ban to
allow it to eliminate a 670-ton stockpile of ivory, worth an
estimated $128 million.
   ``The bill fully demonstrates that Hong Kong has no intention
whatsoever of extending ivory trade beyond the six-month
reservation period,'' the Agricultural and Fisheries Department
said in a statement.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell across the northern Plains today as it followed a cold
snap that is threatening livestock in Kansas.
   Snow was falling today in central Montana, western South Dakota,
much of Nebraska and east-central Wyoming as the cold front moved
eastward.
   Advisories for stockmen were posted in Kansas late Thursday
until Saturday. The sharp change to cold and wet weather will be
hazardous to very young livestock, it said.
   In the Southwest, temperatures were unseasonably warm Thursday.
Records for the date were broken for El Paso, Texas, where it was
84, and three cities in Arizona. Phoenix was 94, Tucson 90 and
Flagstaff was 67.
   Colder temperatures with gusty winds moved across Washington
state Thursday, bringing snow flurries to the eastern portion of
the state. Snow was falling early today in Spokane.
   Authorities lifted one flood warning in Georgia Thursday, but
some residents along the Flint and Ocmulgee rivers prepared to
evacuate. The Flint was expected to crest today, and the Ocmulgee
on Saturday.
   The high temperature for the nation Thursday was 97 degrees at
Borrego Springs, Calif.

   Richard Pryor was hospitalized after
suffering a mild heart attack in northeastern Australia, and his
agent said today that the comedian and actor was in stable
condition and in good spirits.
   Pryor was admitted to Wesley Hospital three days ago with chest
pains, a hospital statement said today. It said Pryor was diagnosed
as having suffered a minor heart attack.
   Pryor, 49, was expected to be released early next week, said his
agent, Guy McElwaine.
   ``Obviously, something like this tempers anyone,'' McElwaine
told Austrlaian Associated Press. ``It scares me and it scares him.
But he's in good spirits and making a few jokes.
   ``He said to me: Now you'll see what I'll go through to create
new material,'' said McElwaine, who flew to Australia from Los
Angeles to see him.
   The Australian news agency said the comedian had been
vacationing at the Sanctuary Cove resort in northeastern Queensland
state.
   McElwaine, Pryor's agent for 15 years, said Pryor was taken to a
hospital near the resort after complaining of chest pains and then
transferred to the Wesley for tests.
   The hospital spokeswoman, Janice Wyatte, said Pryor was on a
private visit. She did not say when he arrived in Australia or how
long he planned to stay.
   ``He is in a very stable condition. He had some more tests this
morning,'' Ms. Wyatte said.
   Pryor has appeared thin and in poor health in recent public
appearances. The comedian was very nearly killed in 1980 while
``free-basing'' cocaine, which involves heating the drug over an
open flame.
   Pryor has starred in several movies based on his stand-up comedy
performances, including ``Richard Pryor Here and Now,'' ``Richard
Pryor Live in Concert'' and ``Richard Pryor Is Back Live in
Concert.''
   The comedian recounted his drug and other experiences in the
films ``Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip'' and ``Jo Jo
Dancer, Your Life is Calling.''
   Other film credits include ``Harlem Nights,'' ``Stir Crazy,''
``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' ``Brewster's Millions'' and
``Critical Condition.''

   Jim Neubacher, a Detroit Free Press
columnist who became an outspoken advocate of handicapped rights
after developing multiple sclerosis, died Thursday. He was 40.
   The cause of death was not available.
   Neubacher joined the Free Press staff in 1971. He worked as a
city desk reporter and was the newspaper's first Canada
correspondent.
   In 1980 at age 29, Neubacher was diagnosed with multiple
sclerosis. He returned to Detroit two years later and began to
write his weekly column, Disabled in Detroit. Neubacher became a
leader for disabled activists across the state.
   Neubacher is survived by his parents, James and Margaret, a
brother and three sisters.

<TEXT>
   A man charged with possessing $20
million worth of stolen rare books has a 20-year history of arrests
on theft charges, but kept getting off lightly, according to a
police officer investigating thefts at a university library.
   ``I know his measurements. I know his mannerisms, but I've never
met him. But I'd know him if he walked in the door,'' Cpl. J. Steve
Huntsberry of the Washington State University Police Department at
Pullman, Wash., said Thursday. ``I've traced his trail throughout
the United States.''
   Stephen Carrie Blumberg, 41, was arrested Tuesday in Ottumwa, in
southeastern Iowa, and charged with possessing stolen goods worth
more than $5,000 and knowingly taken across state lines. The FBI
said 11,000 rare books and documents at his home in Ottumwa were
stolen from universities and private collections across the country.
   The FBI began work Wednesday trying to match the thousands of
books with reports of stolen materials. ``It's going to take months
_ it could stretch well over a year,'' said FBI agent Larry
Holmquist.
   Huntsberry said he was assigned full-time in December 1987 to
study the theft of $500,000 worth of books from Washington State
University's Holland Library. He said he had not determined if any
of the Holland Libary's books were seized in Ottumwa.
   He chronicled Blumberg's arrests from Riverside, Calif., to
Dubuque, Iowa, for an article in the February issue of ``Library &amp;
Archival Security'' magazine, a trade journal published by Haworth
Press of Binghamton, N.Y.
   Blumberg kept getting off with ``a slap on the wrist,''
Huntsberry said.
   Don Nickerson, an attorney representing Blumberg, said Thursday,
``As far as I'm concerned, that's just unverified information.''
   Officials in Riverside, Calif.; Greeley, Colo.; and Dubuque,
Iowa, confirmed the arrests on charges of possessing burglary
tools, larceny and theft.
   Huntsberry said Blumberg was first arrested at age 19 in Dubuque
on charges of stealing antique doorknobs. Dubuque police confirmed
that warrants were issued for Blumberg in December 1967 for
carrying a concealed weapon and in February 1968 for larceny. There
was no word if the cases resulted in prosecution; the Dubuque
County attorney's office said records that old were not available.
   Huntsberry said the first arrest linking Blumberg to rare books
was in 1974 in Fort Lupton, Colo., near Greeley, where he ``had his
car just stuffed from the rafters to the floor with books'' from
universities in Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and Colorado.
   Tom Quammen, an assistant district attorney in the area, said
Blumberg was charged with felony theft in April 1974, but a judge
dismissed the case later that year.
   Huntsberry said he discovered that a man arrested at the
University of California-Riverside Library on charges of possessing
burglary tools and trespassing had the schedule for Holland Library
in his briefcase.
   The man gave the name Matt McGue but fingerprint comparisons
identified the man as Stephen Carrie Blumberg, Huntsberry said.
   The district attorney's office in Riverside County, Calif., said
a charge of possessing burglary tools was filed against a Matt
McGue in April 1988. The Riverside Municipal Court said the man
pleaded guilty to trespassing and to possessing instruments with
intent to break and enter, and was fined $1,065 and given three
years summary probation.
   Blumberg's father, Henry, a retired physician from Shoreview,
Minn., described his son as ``kind of an eccentric genius. This son
of mine is an oddball if you ever saw one.''
   He said his son, who lived off a family trust fund, had a
30-year history of mental problems and had spent time in
psychiatric hospitals in Minnesota, Ohio and Kansas.

<HEAD>Successful Surgery on Singer's Broken Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL GEITNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The doctor who operated on Gloria Estefan's
spine says the surgery was a success and he expects the singer,
known for her energetic dancing on stage, will fully recover in
three to six months.
   ``She'll be able to do everything, including dance,'' Dr.
Michael Neuwirth said at a news conference Thursday at the
Orthopedic Institute Hospital for Joint Diseases in Manhattan.
   Estefan, 32, star of the Latin-pop group Miami Sound Machine,
was brought to the hospital by helicopter Wednesday after her tour
bus was hit by a truck in Pennsylvania.
   The operation involved implanting two steel rods into her spine.
She fractured two vertebrae.
   Estefan felt numbness and weakness in her legs after the
accident. Neuwirth said monitors recorded ``substantial improvement
in the electrical conduction of the nerves to her left leg'' during
the surgery.
   ``We were able to accomplish all our initial goals of surgery,
which was to restore the normal line of the spine and remove the
pressure that existed against the spinal cord,'' he said.
   Estefan probably would be released from the hospital in a week
to 10 days but will be required to wear a plastic brace and undergo
therapy, Neuwirth said.
   Her husband, Emilio, 37, thanked the doctors and Estefan's fans
for their concern and support.
   ``I don't care if she never danced again,'' he said. ``I'm just
happy she's alive.''
   He received minor injuries in the accident and appeared at the
news conference with a bandaged right hand. Their 9-year-old son,
Nayab, suffered a broken collarbone.
   The Cuban-born singer and her group were headed to Syracuse on
Tuesday for a concert when their tour bus was struck from behind by
a tractor-trailer on a highway near Tobyhanna, Pa.
   Estefan was thrown from a couch where she was sleeping.
   Pennsylvania State Police said Thursday that an inspection of
the truck showed it had faulty brakes. The trucker, Heraldo E.
Samuels, was cited for driving at an unsafe speed and will face
additional charges, police said.
   Well-wishers have included President Bush, who met Estefan
Monday to talk about her anti-drug work; Elton John; Madonna; Bruce
Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi.
   Miami Sound Machine hits include ``Rhythm Is Gonna Get You,''
and ``Anything for You.'' Estefan was nominated for a Grammy in
February for ``Don't Wanna Lose You,'' a cut from her solo album.

   The judge in the fraud trial of Imelda Marcos
used humor to respond to government complaints that the attorney
for the former Philippine first lady was talking too much to the
press.
   ``You're not going to be on `60 Minutes' again?'' U.S. District
Judge John F. Keenan asked Mrs. Marcos' attorney, Gerald Spence.
The judge referred to a profile of Spence the CBS News show aired
several years ago.
   ``It depends on what you're going to do to me,'' Spence said.
   ``How about `Saturday Night Live'?'' the judge said with a smile.
   The exchange took place during the third day of jury selection
Thursday after Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Livingston gave Keenan
a letter charging that Spence's numerous interviews threatened
``the government's right to a fair trial.''
   The interviews the prosecutor referred to were excerpts from an
NBC-TV ``Today Show'' broadcast on Tuesday and comments made to
several newspapers before the trial began in federal court.
   The judge gently admonished Spence to cut back on media
appearances but stopped short of a gag order.
   By the end of the court day Thursday, Keenan had selected a pool
of 31 potential jurors. A final panel of 12 jurors and six
alternates is to be chosen from the pool next week.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is charged in the alleged illegal transfer of
more than $160 million from the Manila government and defrauding
banking institutions of another $165 million.
   Her husband, former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, was
named in the original 1988 indictment but died in Hawaii Sept. 28.
   Also on trial is Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, accused of
helping the Marcoses conceal a series of New York real estate deals
allegedly financed in part with money stolen from the Philippines
treasury.

<HEAD>Poll Puts Opposition Ahead on Eve of Australian Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opinion poll released today showed a
last-minute swing toward the conservative opposition, indicating
Prime Minister Bob Hawke might be thwarted in his bid for a record
fourth consecutive term.
   Hawke, the Labor Party leader, has said Saturday's parliamentary
election was the most important in more than 40 years.
   He said the vote would set Australia's course into the 21st
century.
   Hawke, in office seven years, is the most enduring and popular
Labor Party leader and goes into the election on his record of
economic reform.
   His opponent, Liberal Party leader Andrew Peacock, 51, has
hammered the government over high interest rates, which at a record
18 percent hurt home buyers and small businesses. But few issues
were discussed in the campaign.
   The Hawke government, first elected in 1983, then again in 1984,
and 1987, faces other domestic problems as well. The foreign debt
stands at $100 billion, and a lengthy pilots' dispute has crippled
tourism.
   Earlier polls indicated a close result, but Morgan Gallup said
today taht Peacock's coalition of the Liberal and National parties
led the government 42 percent to 39.5 percent. The poll results,
shown on national television, did not say how many people were
surveyed or give a margin of error.
   Australia has 10.6 million voters and voting is compulsory.
   Most major newspapers today threw their support behind the
60-year-old prime minister. The Sydney Morning Herald said, ``The
Hawke government should be re-elected, not because its record of
economic management is perfect, but because it is more likely than
Mr. Peacock to solve economic problems.''
   Editorial writers have called it an election without issues,
noting that foreign policy and defense have not been questions.
   Australia is a close U.S. ally, and President Bush today said he
wanted to visit Australia soon, but not before the election.
   ``If there is any national mood overall, it is that an angry
electorate wants to kick Hawke in the teeth to teach him a lesson
but cannot quite bring itself to vote for Peacock,'' wrote the
Courier-Mail newspaper of Brisbane.
   Campaigning has been muted. The Herald observed: ``Each party
leader has the combined charisma of a wet salad sandwich.''
   Peacock, a former foreign minister, is making his second attempt
to become prime minister and is widely regarded as fighting his
last political battle.
   He drew charges of racism this week after saying his coalition
would scrap a Japanese proposal to build a multibillion-dollar
futuristic, high-tech city in Australia. Peacock said he was
opposed to ceating an ``enclave.''
   Hawke responded that Peacock was against immigrants, a serious
charge in a country whose first settlers were prisoners expelled
from Britain.
   When the campaign began last month, Hawke said: ``I believe the
election is the most important one since 1949,'' referring to a
Labor loss that began 23 years in power for the Liberals.
   ``The election will essentially determine the character of the
nation that we are going to have in the 21st century,'' Hawke said.

<TEXT>
   The government ordered Cuba's
ambassador to leave the country within five days because he refuses
to recognize the new administration of President Guillermo Endara.
   The Cuban government's position has been one of ``harassment,
hostility and rejection,'' Foreign Minister Julio Linares said
Thursday after telling Cuban Ambassador Lazaro Mora Secades he had
to leave by Tuesday. ``We're not going to let a goverment that is
saying it doesn't recognize President Endara maintain accredited
diplomatic missions in Panama.''
   Endara was installed at the beginning of the Dec. 20 U.S.
invasion that ousted Panama's military leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, who maintained friendly relations with Communist Cuba and
shared President Fidel Castro's hostility toward the United States.
   Noriega took refuge at the Vatican Embassy before giving himself
up to U.S. authorities and was flown to Florida to face federal
drug trafficking and money-laundering charges.
   Several members of Noriega's family took refuge in the Cuban
Embassy in Panama City after the American invasion. They have since
been given safe conduct out of the country.
   Endara has ``a legitimacy that no other Latin American
government enjoys, since no Latin American leader has been elected
with an overwhelming 3-1 mayority,'' Linares said, referring to the
May 1989 election Noriega anulled.
   The expulsion ``puts us on the edge of breaking of diplomatic
relations'' with Cuba, Linares said. But, he added, ``Cuba can
answer by breaking off diplomacy. That's its problem, that's its
decision.''
   Panama maintains a diplomatic mission in Cuba.
   Linares said that if diplomatic relations are broken, Cuban
diplomats should take with them Luis Gomez, a leader of the
paramilitary Dignity Battalions and a former congressman, who took
refuge in the Cuban Embassy.
   Linares has said Panama refuses to let Gomez out of the country
because two charges of assassination have been filed against him.

<HEAD>American Loses Appeal of Murder Conviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American who belonged to the Irish Republican
Army lost an appeal today of his conviction for the 1975 murder of
a London policeman.
   The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction of William Quinn, 42,
who was extradited to Britain and sentenced to life in prison in
February 1988 for shooting a 21-year-old constable, Stephen Tibble,
while fleeing arrest.
   Quinn had appealed, claiming faulty identification by a
policeman who saw the shooting. It ``offended against almost all
the rules designed to safeguard suspects from misidentification,''
argued his attorney, Michael Mansfield.
   Lord Lane, presiding over the three-judge panel, conceded that
it was ``very far from being the best sort of identification
evidence.''
   But ``it was relevant evidence of significant weight,'' and
``did not have such an adverse effect upon the fairness of the
proceedings'' that it should have been disqualified, he said.
   After the shooting, Quinn went to Ireland, where he was jailed
for 12 months for IRA membership. It was at that trial that he was
secretly identified by a Scotland Yard detective, Adrian
Blackledge, as Tibble's killer.
   Mansfield argued that such an identification was inadmissible in
court, and that by failing to inform Quinn of it, the prosecution
deprived him of an opportunity to establish an alibi.
   After his release from Irish prison, Quinn returned to the San
Francisco area. Britain requested his extradition, and after a
five-year legal fight he was flown to London by the FBI.

<TEXT>
   Pakistan showed off its military
muscle today during celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of a
decision to create a Moslem nation from predominantly Hindu India.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan's speech at the Pakistan Day
military parade was laced with warnings to India and promises that
Pakistan would stand behind ``freedom movements.''
   He referred specifically to the 2-month-old uprising in the
disputed state of Jammu-Kashmir, where Moslem militants are
fighting for independence.
   Ishaq Khan urged India to ``learn history's lesson that
liberation movements cannot be suprressed or crushed with the use
of might.''
   The former princely state of Kashmir was divided between
Pakistan and India following the end to British colonial rule in
1947.
   The president, who has been aligned with often hostile
opposition parties, smiled and chatted with Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto throughout the two-hour parade, an indication that the two
had reached an amicable understanding.
   Since taking power on Dec. 2, 1988, Ms. Bhutto and her
right-wing opposition have been at loggerheads and periodically
engage in so-called war of rallies, with each trying to eclipse the
other in attendance.
   Ms. Bhutto's populist Pakistan People's Party staged a rally
Tuesday in the eastern Punjab capital of Lahore, her opposition's
homeground. Hundreds of thousands attended. Today, the opposition
retaliated with its own rally. Local journalists said turnout was
similar.

   Residents of small towns that are losing
business and population because there are fewer farms in the United
States are closer to getting help from the federal government.
   A rural development bill was approved 360-45 by the House and
sent on Thursday to a conference committee for negotiators to work
out differences with the Senate version.
   ``They can be meshed,'' said Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., who
wrote the House version with Rep. Tom Coleman, R-Mo.
   English said a key provision would establish state review panels
to set priorities on how federal money should be used. He said the
experts on those 16-member panels will represent many resources in
the states and have access to money beyond that available in
Washington.
   ``They probably are going to make the big difference when it is
all said and done,'' English said. ``The concept of the panels is
that it brings all the resources together.''
   Representatives would come from government, business, and local
community organizations.
   The bill was hung up for a week because of a dispute over how
states could use about $800 million in three separate funds in the
bill.
   Rep. Charles Rose, D-N.C., led a movement to stop the bill's
authors from pooling the funds _ $600 million in sewer and water,
$100 million in community facilities and $100 million in business
and industry development.
   English and Coleman wanted to let states decide for themselves
how to use the money so they could direct funds from the overall
pool to where local officials decided it is most needed.
   But Rose successfully argued that the sewer and water fund might
be depleted, leaving communities in worse shape than they're in now.
   On Thursday, the House reached a compromise that frees up $90
million of about $450 million government loans that can be used for
either sewer and water or community facilities.
   It freezes all the grant money in the three categories as it is
now. And, it allows the shifting of guaranteed loans among the
three categories.

<TEXT>
   In Panama last year and Nicaragua this year,
the demand from Washington was unambiguous: hold a free and fair
election. It's hard to imagine elections anywhere that were
scrutinized more closely.
   Now comes a book by Robert Caro suggesting one of the most
important U.S. elections of the post-war era was, in fact, rigged
by Lyndon Johnson.
   Caro makes the case that the outcome of the 1948 Senate
Democratic primary race in Texas did not reflect the will of the
voters because Johnson stuffed ballot boxes with 35,000 phony
votes, giving him an 87-vote margin over Coke Stevenson.
   Johnson, of course, went on to become Senate majority leader and
president. The course of history was altered by what happened in
1948, assuming Caro got his facts straight; thus far, credible
evidence to refute him has not surfaced.
   That election is not the only one about which questions have
been raised. The public probably will never know whether John F.
Kennedy actually beat Richard Nixon in 1960 because of strange
happenings on election night in Illinois.
   The furor over Caro's book, arising as Nicaraguans were
preparing to vote, raises the question: Does the U.S. have the
moral authority to demand purity in foreign elections in light of
the spotty record at home?
   The election run by Daniel Ortega was certainly more honest than
the Texas primary Caro describes. Perhaps Ortega, soon to retire,
should offer to monitor U.S. elections to ensure the will of the
American people is not trampled on.
   Can you envision Ortega paying a visit to Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, on election night next November and asking him to respect
the outcome of his bid for another term?
   ``To do otherwise would strike a blow at the democratic
process,'' statesman Ortega might counsel Gramm.
   Kidding aside, the founding fathers got it right: government
can't be trusted. There are pious moralisms in public statements
and, at times, an anything goes attitude behind the scenes.
   All governments, for example, are very selective about when to
express indignation.
   When an anti-communist is slain, say, in El Salvador, the U.S.
government is quick to blame leftist guerrillas. When someone from
the left is killed, U.S. officials invariably say they are puzzled
about who did the deed.
   For years, the United States had been saying the big problem in
Afghanistan was the Soviet military presence. Well, the Soviets
have been gone for more than a year but the fighting persists,
partly because U.S. weapons deliveries are still going to the
Afghan rebels.
   John F. Burns, a New York Times reporter, writes that rebel
rocket attacks killed an estimated 1,000 people in Kabul, the
capital, last year and several times that many across the country.
   Among Afghans, Burns writes, ``the damage to American prestige
has been immense.'' They now look on the United States as a distant
power that sanctions ``the routine killing of civilians,'' he says.
   The State Department attitude is to say as little as possible
about the rebel abuses. On the other hand, virtually every election
abuse committed by the Sandinistas last winter was dealt with as a
matter of utmost gravity.
   The U.S. government, of course, has no monopoly on hypocrisy and
probably comes out better than most countries. Many Latin American
presidents who attended the recent presidential inaugural in Chile
took steps to avoid being photographed with the departing Augusto
Pinochet. A dictator is one thing, but being associated with an
unelected president was too much.
   But that high principle was set aside last year when the same
Latin American presidents rallied behind Cuba for one of the
coveted hemispheric seats in the U.N. Security Council. There are
almost 20 countries in Spanish-speaking Latin America. Cuba is now
the only one without an elected president, but now sits proudly in
the Security Council.
   Of course, Cuba itself sometimes leaves itself open to
allegations that it deviates from high principle. Government
propagandists call Cuba ``the first free country of the Americas.''
Anyone who disputes that claim runs the risk of imprisonment.

   Armored cars and jeeps mounted with
machine guns patrolled the quiet capital today after the
assassination of a left-wing presidential candidate caused fierce
clashes between police and protesters.
   The government blamed a drug baron for Thursday's killing of
Patiotic Union candidate Bernardo Jaramillo _ the second
presidential contender slain in seven months. It said the killing
marked a new anti-government offensive by drug traffickers.
   The head of the Medellin drug cartel, Pablo Escobar, sent a
letter to a leftist leader denying any involvement in Jaramillo's
death and suggesting that other drug traffickers were to blame,
according to the Colombian radio networks RCN and Caracol.
   Jaramillo was shot Thursday morning at Bogota's international
airport by a a young man who reached out as if to greet the
candidate, then shot him with a submachine gun hidden in a
newspaper.
   His bodyguards shot and wounded the gunman, a 16-year-old boy
who carried false identification papers, before he was captured. At
least two other people were reported wounded.
   Jaramillo, 38, was the 1,044th Patriotic Union Party member to
be killed in the past six years. Many of the slayings have been
attributed to right-wing death squads. Authorities say the squads
are run by drug traffickers.
   Others say Colombia's army and police are involved in the squads
to quell a leftist guerrilla insurgency.
   Jaramillo's body lay in state in the Capitol building.
   His killing caused battles Thursday between police and leftist
protesters, who burned five buses and shattered store windows in
downtown Bogota. Police said the fighting killed one soldier and
wounded four policeman and a civilian.
   Armored cars with 20mm cannons and jeeps mounted with machine
guns cruised the city of 6 million people this morning. The
government banned alcohol sales and closed all private schools in
Bogota. The city was calm.
   The Patriotic Union urged a national strike, but President
Virgilio Barco appealed to Colombians to unite to confront ``the
new offensive by the violent ones.''
   A communique from the National Security Council said Escobar
contracted Jaramillo's killer for about $750. Police intercepted a
communication between Escobar to an associate in which they
discussed the deal, the communique said.
   The head of the country's intelligence police, Miguel Maza
Marquez, _ himself the target of attacks by drug traffickers _ said
the young gunman told police the cartel was planning more attacks.
   The commander of the army brigade in Medellin, Gen. Harold
Bedoya, said in an interview today with radio Caracol that the army
had irrefutable proof of Escobar's guilt in the killing. He did not
elaborate.
   Escobar this morning sent a letter to Diego Montana, the
president of the Patriotic Union, according to the two radio
networks. Both networks said they were sent copies of the letter,
written in longhand and bearing what appeared to be the authentic
signature and a fingerprint of Escobar.
   Escobar's letter reportedly said that another Medellin cartel
leader, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, had ordered the killing of
Jaramillo last year. Escobar reportedly wrote that he intervened to
stop the assassination.
   Rodriguez Gacha was killed Dec. 15 in a gunbattle with police on
Colombia's north coast, but it is known that the head of his
private army, Fidel Castano, has kept the Rodriguez Gacha faction
together and wields great power among the traffickers.
   A man claiming to represent the Medellin cartel said in a
telephone call to the Caracol radio network that Jaramillo's
killing was the beginning of a new terrorist offensive. He said the
next target would be Cesar Gaviria, the governing Liberal Party
candidate in the elections May 27.
   ``He (Gaviria) could have 100 bodyguards or wear a bulletproof
vest, including over his head, but he will be the next one,'' the
caller said.
   Gaviria served as campaign chairman for Sen. Luis Carlos Galan,
who was killed by traffickers at a political rally Aug. 18.
   Hours after Galan's death, Barco launched a crackdown on drug
barons and began efforts to extradite them to the United States. In
Colombia, traffickers often intimidate or bribe judges to ensure
light sentences or no sentences.
   The Medellin drug cartel responded to Barco's crackdown with
bombings that killed 209 Colombians before the group announced a
truce on Jan. 17.
   The caller said the cartel renewed its attacks because Barco
rejected its offer to surrender in exchange for an end to
extraditions. The government has extradited 14 drug trafficking
suspects to the United States.
   Barco has said the government will make no concessions to
traffickers and that they should turn themselves in.
   The caller responded: ``Yes, we will turn ourselves in, but
dead. Before that this country is going to be half destroyed
because tomorrow we are going to renew terrorist attacks,
especially against government and leftist objectives.''
   ``You journalists, before you see our bodies, will see the
bodies of other distinguished people in this country like
Jaramillo.''

<HEAD>General Now Doubts American Was Involved in Coup Attempt</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Fixes spelling to impostor in grafs 1 and 9.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A Filipino general who claimed a U.S.
intelligence agent offered weapons to mutineers in the December
coup attempt said today he now thinks the man was an impostor.
   Brig. Gen. Alejandro Galido, who spied on coup plotters, had
said an American claiming to be a U.S. Air Force colonel and
representative of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency told him in
July that the agency ``favors the overthrow of the (President
Corazon) Aquino government.''
   Galido's statement released Wednesday said the man, who
identified himself as Harold Magleo, promised to deliver weapons
for the rebellion and that the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency
wanted Ferdinand Marcos returned to power.
   But in a television interview today, Galido, the former chief of
the Southern Luzon Command, said he thought the man was posing as a
U.S. agent.
   ``I really do not know his true identity. He could be one of
those impostors, one who pretends to be an intelligence officer of
the DIA,'' Galido said in an interview with Channel 2.
   The chief of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa, described Galido as a
spy who infiltrated the ranks of the coup plotters and reported to
him on the progress of the planned rebellion.
   The Dec. 1-9 coup attempt, which left at least 113 dead and 600
wounded, was sixth and most serious bid to topple Mrs. Aquino, who
came to power after a popular uprising that ousted Marcos in 1986.
   Marcos fled to Hawaii, where he died in September.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos also said he believed the man who
spoke to Galido was an impostor.
   ``Now I have a feeling that this Magleo is an adventurer posing
as a government agent or as a government official and we have all
kinds of people like that whose services are for sale for a price,
willing to undergo any dirty job,'' Ramos said.
   ``And so I think the best thing to do is look for this person.''
   Mrs. Aquino said she was convinced Galido's sworn statements
``were prompted by his sense of patriotism.''
   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, Victoria Middleton, said in a
statement Thursday that allegations of U.S. government involvement
in the coup attempt was ``totally false and without foundation.''
   U.S. jet fighters provided air cover for loyal troops on the
first day of the mutiny, turning the tide of the rebellion in favor
of the government.

<HEAD>Long Island Village Charged With Keeping Minorities Out of
Subsidized Housing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors are charging a Long Island
village and some of its officials with defrauding the government by
scheming to keep minorities out of federally subsidized housing.
   The civil lawsuit, which seeks at least $10.5 million in damages
plus the forfeiture of six Island Park homes illegally obtained by
the defendants, was filed Thursday in federal court in Brooklyn.
   It is the first government lawsuit naming a HUD official since
allegations of influence-peddling at the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development surfaced in 1988.
   Island Park officials, including the mayor and a former top aide
in the New York HUD office, were accused of manipulating the
housing ``to favor relatives, friends and associates, and employees
of the Village of Island Park,'' court papers said.
   Federal prosecutors also have been looking into reputed
soliciting of political funds for Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato from
builders who received HUD funds, but the Long Island Republican is
not named in the lawsuit.
   Andrew J. Maloney, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of
New York, has removed himself from the investigation because of his
close connections to the senator. Maloney was recommended for the
position by D'Amato.
   According to the complaint, Island Park Mayor Michael A. Parente
and Geraldine McGann, a HUD official and village trustee; Harold
Scully, the village clerk and others conspired to exclude blacks
and Hispanics from housing in Island Park.
   Parente, who chose not to seek re-election, will be replaced as
mayor on April 2. He was in Florida and no telephone number was
available for him.
   Beginning in 1980, 44 single-family homes ranging in price from
$40,000 to $63,700 were built in three phases under a HUD program,
and federal officials had intended for at least 17 to go to
minority families.
   While the village agreed to advertise the availability of the
subsidized housing in black and Hispanic newspapers, the eventual
buyers of the homes had been selected before the ads appeared, the
lawsuit said.
   Ms. McGann's son, Daniel, and his wife purchased one of the
subsidized homes, even though they were not eligible to receive
one, according to the lawsuit, which also names McGann and his wife
as defendants.
   According to the complaint, Ms. McGann became a paid trustee of
the village in August 1982, while serving simultaneously as the
special assistant to Joseph Monticciolo, the HUD regional
administrator for Region II.
   In serving in the two roles, Ms. McGann on several occasions
allegedly breached her ``fiduciary duty'' to HUD by voting for land
dealings that ultimately were not in the best interests of the
agency, the lawsuit maintains.
   She also was allegedly aware of the other defendants'
manipulation of the husing program to the exclusion of blacks and
other minorities.
   Ms. McGann, now assigned to HUD's Washington offices, is on
leave until next month and her office could not provide a telephone
number where she could be reached for comment.
   HUD said in a statement Thursday it began termination
proceedings against Ms. McGann.

   Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis today accused Moscow of waging ``psychological
warfare'' to force his Baltic republic to renounce its declaration
of independence.
   And, in a letter to the Soviet Parliament, he said that any
attempt by the Soviet government or military to interfere with the
enforcement of Lithuanian law would be a violation of international
law.
   Soviet armor rumbled through the Lithuanian capital's streets on
Thursday, prompting the republic's leaders to issue a worldwide
appeal for support and express concern that increasing Kremlin
pressure would lead to violence.
   The appeal followed orders from Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev that Lithuania stop signing up its own volunteer forces.
He gave Landsbergis two days to reply, and ordered citizens to
surrender their firearms within a week.
   At the same time, Soviet military authorities ordered Lithuanian
soldiers who deserted in the wake of independence to return to
their units by Saturday, touching off fears that the rounding up of
deserters would be used as a pretext to use military force.
   Landsbergis said he was ``concerned'' that both deadlines fell
on Saturday.
   In Moscow, Gorbachev's military adviser, Marshal Sergei
Akhromeyev, told reporters that the army would act in accordance
with Soviet laws in dealing with deserters.
   Asked if mass arrests might not cause disruption in Lithuania
and make Moscow look bad, Akhromeyev said: ``Whether it looks good
or looks bad, there's an established order, even if some people
don't like it.''
   He said deserters would be detained and sent back to their
units, where their fate would be determined. Some Lithuanians have
deserted their units after complaining that fellow soldiers beat
them in retaliation for their republic's declaration of
independence.
   Landsbergis said the Kremlin ``was going from economic warfare
to psychological warfare'' in its attempts to make Lithuania
renounce its March 11 declaration, according to Rita Dapkus of the
Parliament's information center.
   ``New troops and maneuvers suggest that this is a psychological
war,'' Landsbergis told parliament today.
   Landsbergis' attitude toward Gorbachev appeared conciliatory.
``Perhaps he faces obstacles,'' he said, adding that he still
believed in the Soviet leader and hoped his good sense and
moderation will lead a resolution of the problems.
   Landsbergis appealed directly to the Soviet legislature for
negotiations to solve the issues that Gorbachev has raised. A
three-page letter was sent to the Supreme Soviet.
   ``Any attempt by the government or military organizations of the
U.S.S.R. to interfere in enforcement of Lithuanian law in Lithuania
will be viewed as a violation of generally recognized principles of
international law,'' the letter said.
   The letter added that in a 1920 treaty, the Soviet Union
recognized ``for all time'' the sovereign rights and independence
of Lithuania.
   Landsbergis opened the session with an account of the U.S.
Senate's resolution Thursday night urging Moscow to stop
intimidating Lithuania and asking President Bush to consider
granting the republic diplomatic recognition.
   ``The reaction was applause,'' Dapkus said.
   The Kremlin has said it would not use force to bring Lithuania
back into the Soviet Union. But Lithuanians have become
increasingly concerned by the growing Soviet military presence in
their Baltic republic.
   ``It is clear that another republic is going to use force
against Lithuania and its citizens,'' said a Lithuanian government
appeal to the world issued late Thursday. ``We are asking people to
prevent this by protesting the possible use of violence against a
member of the world community, against Lithuania and its citizens.''
   A Lithuanian journalist identified only as R. Valatka said
Thursday on late-night Lithuanian television that KGB officials had
been going around to police stations asking for counts of their
weapons.
   The republic's police force has not been asked to turn in its
arms, but Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said the KGB ``might
even try to take weapons from the police, I don't know.''
   ``We need support, we need help,'' said Ludwigas Sabutis, the
republic's parliamentary secretary.
   Landsbergis told the Supreme Council legislature Thursday that
the republic would not use weapons, even if the Soviet Union
crushed its drive for full independence.
   ``If tanks are sent to take away shotguns and hunting rifles, we
won't shoot at the tanks,'' he said. ``Our resistance will be
non-violence.''
   Gorbachev, in a telegram to Landsbergis, demanded a halt to
formation of volunteer brigades in Lithuania that he said were
intended to replace Soviet border guards and part of the uniformed
police.
   He gave Landsbergis two days to repond.
   Although volunteers are signing up for the squads in Lithuania,
no brigades have been formed and there are no indications they
would be armed.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said border controls and
exit and entry in Lithuania were being tightened in keeping with a
directive Wednesday from Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev has called Lithuania's declaration of independence
illegal but has also said he would not use force to keep it from
seceding from the Soviet Union.
   Lithuania was independent from 1918 until 1940, when the Soviet
Union forcibly annexed it along with Latvia and Estonia. So far, no
foreign country has officially recognized Lithuania as independent.
   The republic of 3.8 million had rushed to declare its
independence before Gorbachev gained broad powers that include
authority to impose direct presidential rule on areas of the Soviet
Union.

   Not only has Donald Trump kept the whereabouts
of his alleged mistress Marla Maples a close secret, he has kept
her close, according to a published report.
   Ms. Maples is living in the Trump Tower across the hall from
Trump, gossip columnist Liz Smith reported in today's editions of
the Daily News.
   Ms. Maples moved into the building in December, Smith said, and
has been coming and going during the past 5{ weeks of intensive
media scrutiny.
   After Trump's separation from his wife, Ivana, became public in
February, Donald moved in across the hall, Smith said.
   Sources told the News that Ms. Maples has evaded detection by
driving into a side entrance and taking a service elevator directly
her 63rd floor apartment.
   Ivana Trump reportedly was infuriated that Ms. Maples was living
just three floors below the triplex apartment where she lives with
her children.
   ``I am shocked and saddened that Donald could subject me and the
children to such shameful behavior,'' the News quotes Mrs. Trump as
saying.
   It was reported Thursday that Trump was ``dropping'' Ms. Maples.
   But Smith called this a ruse designed to ``soften up'' Mrs.
Trump and prevent her from making legal moves that might embarrass
Trump before he goes before the New Jersey Casino Control
Commission on Thursday.
   Trump is seeking final license approval for the Taj Mahal, his
mega-casino slated to open April 5 in Atlantic City.
   Trump's spokesman has refused to comment on the alleged affair.

<HEAD>Mayor Bradley Orders Water Rationing Plan for L.A.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley has ordered development of
a stringent water rationing plan that could be carried out this
summer during a fourth year of drought.
   Continued dry conditions could result in a 12 percent decline in
Southern California's water supplies, affecting 13 million
customers.
   Most of the agencies that distribute water for the giant
Metropolitan Water District say they don't have the power to
enforce water conservation programs. They add that they must be
backed by residents in the 300 communities across the six-county
region the district serves.
   ``We have to rely on the cooperation of our sub-agencies,'' said
Tom Salzano, assistant general manager of the Central Basin Water
District in Downey. The district acts as a liaison between the
Metropolitan Water District and more than two dozen small water
districts.
   Council President John Ferraro also put out a call to be water
stingy.
   ``Now is the time for other Southern California communities to
join Los Angeles in enacting mandatory water conservation
ordinances which can be easily implemented,'' Ferraro said Thursday.
   Bradley last week, without public announcement, requested the
city's Department of Water and Power to develop a plan that
includes large fines for violators.
   This week, the Metropolitan Water District ordered the Los
Angeles water department and the other 27 agencies that are
district members to draw up mandatory rationing plans.
   ``It's complicated,'' said Ronald Palmer, general manager of the
Foothill Municipal Water District in La Canada, which serves seven
smaller agencies. The district would have to rely on the county
Board of Supervisors to enact water rationing laws, Palmer said.
   Robert Bammes, public works administrator and chief of water
supplies for Beverly Hills, said he was unaware of the Metropolitan
Water District's request.
   Some Southern California communities, including Santa Monica,
already have conservation systems in place. Under a mandatory
conservation law, Santa Monica reduced its total water usage by
nearly 10 percent in the past two years.
   ``With voluntary programs you're only reaching those people who
are already convinced, said Atossac Soltani, Santa Monica's water
conservation chief. ``For the rest, you need mandatory programs.''
   Ferraro said a 10 percent water use reduction looms for Los
Angeles.
   The nation's second-largest city has conserved water for the
past two years by banning hosing down of driveways and sidewalks.
Restaurant customers don't get water glasses filled unless they
request it, and showers and toilets that use less water have been
installed throughout the city.

   A truck convoy of emergency food rolled
through a war zone in northern Ethiopia today, but it carried less
than half its planned load because of a damaged bridge.
   Eleven trucks, each loaded with 10 tons of food, left the
provincial capital, Dessie, on a 75-mile journey over a mountainous
road to Kobo, said Yohannes Abraham, an official of the Catholic
Relief Services in Addis Ababa.
   It was the second truck convoy this week. An initial convoy of
11 trucks covered the same route Monday in what relief officials
said was a trial run. Its drivers reported the damaged bridge.
   ``Until it can be repaired we cannot use trailers,'' Abraham
said. Each truck with a trailer can carry up to 22 tons.
   A consortium of Ethiopian churches is taking the food into the
area, which is contested by government troops and the rebel Tigre
People's Liberation Front.
   The Tigreans, who control most of northern Wollo and the whole
of Tigre provinces, are fighting a 15-year-old war to oust
President Mengistu Haile Mariam. The rebels want a government
patterned after that of Albania, the last hard-line Marxist state
in Eastern Europe.
   The emergency food comes largely from private donors in the
United States and Western Europe.
   The operation aims at feeding 1 million people, a quarter of the
number the United Nations says is threatened this year with famine
caused by war and drought in northern Ethiopia.
   The United Nations has appealed for 1.1 million tons of
emergency food.
   Although a formal cease-fire doesn't exist, both the rebels and
the government have promised safe passage for the convoys. But wary
relief officials say the first three drives north will be
exploratory.

<HEAD>`America's Dairyland' Moves To Ban Synthetic Milk Hormone</HEAD>

   The nation's leading dairy state will
temporarily ban the use of a synthetic, milk-producing hormone in
cattle if Gov. Tommy G. Thompson approves a bill passed by the
Legislature.
   Sen. Russell Feingold, the bill's sponsor, said if Thompson
signs the bill, Wisconsin will become the first state to enact a
ban on the genetically engineered bovine growth hormone, or BGH,
that is injected in cows to make them give more milk.
   ``This has been a long, hard battle,'' said Feingold, a Democrat
from Middleton. ``We won. We are sending a loud and clear message
to the governor that we don't want unlabeled BGH out there.''
   The governor said after the Legislature adjourned its session
Thursday that ``I am not ready to say what I am going to veto or
sign.''
   The temporary BGH ban approved by the Senate Thursday on a 21-12
vote would forbid farmers from using the substance until July 1,
1991, or six months after it is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, whichever comes first.
   The bill, which was amended and passed by the Assembly on
Wednesday, would allow use of the synthetic hormone for research.
   The Food and Drug Administration has allowed private companies
to run limited on-farm tests of BGH and the milk has been reaching
consumers, industry officials say. Supporters said the ban would
allow for more research on the product, answering questions of
whether it could have harmful health effects.
   Industry officials also were concerned that by increasing milk
production and milk supply, the hormone could put some small
farmers out of business.
   Critics of the ban said the hormone is safe and banning it will
put dairy farmers in Wisconsin, by far the nation's biggest milk
producer, at a competitive disadvantage.
   The final passage in the Senate was delayed when Republican Sen.
Timothy Weeden staged a two-hour filibuster against the ban,
insisting the measure could someday change the state license plate
motto of ``America's Dairyland'' to read: ``Wisconsin, the nation's
former dairyland.''
   Jeffrey Remsik, a lobbyist for a group called the Animal Health
Institute that favors use of the hormone, called the Senate vote a
``real victory for food terrorists who scare people and the
Legislature into thinking there is something wrong with
biotechnology.''
   Remsik said the four companies that produce the hormone are
likely to sue the state, adding pressure on Thompson to veto the
bill.
   BGH is an experimental hormone that is designed to boost cows'
production by as much as one-third.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Metropolitan Opera has a remarkably
effective new production of Mozart's ``Don Giovanni,'' and for once
Franco Zeffirelli's design and direction doesn't look like Cecil B.
de Mille taking to the stage.
   Pillars and other reasonably sparse effects move in and out
between every scene and backdrops change. But the motion comes
between scenes, and doesn't distract the audience in the middle of
glorious music, the way some recent Zeffirelli productions of
Puccini and Verdi operas have done.
   The cast at Thursday's premiere was led by Samuel Ramey. No one
could be faulted; it was a grand ensemble effort. Ramey has a
beautiful and elegant tone. His acting was assured, as he strode
around with youthful vigor, arrogantly assuming that all women
belonged to his harem. His mop of hair, single earring and costumes
emphasizing his slim legs indeed made him the image of a rakish
lover.
   Ferruccio Furlanetto sang Leporello in a richer but less
beautiful voice that was at times rough. It'll be interesting to
hear these two men when they trade parts later.
   Carol Vaness sang Donna Anna with an exquisite, pure small
column of sound. Karita Mattila made her Met debut as Donna Elvira.
Her soprano is of a different type than Miss Vaness', with larger
tones, some rosy undertones and the ability to convey much emotion.
Both sang wonderfully in quiet passages and both had plenty to give
when volume was required.
   Dawn Upshaw as Zerlina, the village bride, displayed a more
mellow and mature voice than the young country chirp sometimes
heard. It was a most attractive sound, and her acting kept Zerlina
young.
   Kurt Moll has the dark bass just right for the Commendatore. And
Jerry Hadley has the right tenor for Mozart _ good head tones and
never spreading the tone as tenors must in some Italian operas.
Julien Robbins did well with the thankless part of the bridegroom.
   James Levine and the orchestra played with spirited reverence.
   Zeffirelli did nothing eccentric. He did not have long pleated
pages fall out of Leporello's book, which audiences are thoroughly
tired of seeing.
   The Commendatore's statue is tall and golden, sitting upstage
center with other graveyard statues on each side. When the
Commendatore walks forward, in armor, his statue remains in view.
   When Don Giovanni goes to hell, the statues slide in again, with
creatures writhing on them. He may be getting a preview of hell, as
the Commendatore drags him toward the back of the stage where a
fiery pit has opened.
   Gil Wechsler did lighting and Anna Anni did costumes. However,
at one moment dawn looked like a sunset, and Miss Vaness' costume
made the trim singer look fat.
   This production reassures operagoers who loved the 1957 Eugene
Berman one it replaced.

<TEXT>
   Nine crew members remained missing and
were presumed drowned today after a fishing vessel capsized and
quickly sank in the frigid Bering Sea, the Coast Guard said.
   Twenty-two crew members were rescued Thursday after the 162-foot
Seattle-based Aleutian Enterprise sank about 60 miles south of the
remote Pribilof Islands town of St. Paul, Coast Guard spokesman
Christopher Haley said in Juneau.
   The search for missing sailors was suspended late Thursday.
Coast Guard Lt. Brian Flory said this morning that it was unlikely
the Coast Guard would resume the search.
   ``We had a very good search yesterday,'' he said. ``We think we
would have found anyone who was afloat. I don't think that of the
nine missing that anyone got off the vessel.''
   The cause of the capsizing was not immediately known. The site
is north of the Aleutian Islands chain and southwest of the Alaska
mainland.
   The Coast Guard had previously reported that 10 were missing;
the figure was revised to nine today without explanation.
   Haley said none of the crew was wearing wearing survival suits.
Coast Guard officials said a person probably couldn't survive more
than 30 minutes in the frigid waters without such suits.
   The survivors, all in life rafts, were picked up soon after the
ship sank Thursday afternoon by two sister ships, the Northern
Enterprise and the Pacific Enterprise. A Coast Guard C-130
transport plane was on the scene to provide rescue communications
and medical advice, Haley said.
   About six fishing vessels were in the area and had assisted in
the rescue and search, said Dan Roberts, executive vice president
of Arctic Alaska Fisheries Corp., which manages the Aleutian
Enterprise for a partnership that owns it.
   Although Haley had said late Thursday he thought the survivors
were taken to a St. Paul clinic, Flory said today they were still
aboard a fishing vessel that was en route to Dutch Harbor, on the
Aleutian Island of Unalaska. The vessel, the Bristol Enterprise,
was expected to arrive sometime during the afternoon.
   The rescued crew members were ``in relatively good shape,''
Roberts said Thursday night. ``My understanding is only a couple of
people have minor injuries.''
   He said 15 of those rescued, including the captain, are from the
Seattle area. ``We are in the process of notifying the survivors'
and the other crew members' families.''
   Fair weather was reported in the area Thursday, with visibility
to seven miles, mild winds and seas to 6 feet, Haley said.
   The Aleutian Enterprise is a factory trawler, a large vessel
that catches bottom fish, processes and freezes them on board.
Trawlers normally fish for cod and pollock in the Bering Sea in the
early spring, Roberts said.
   Most of the crew members likely are from Alaska, Washington and
Oregon, he said.
   The vessel, about 10 years old and worth about $6 million, is
owned by Aleutians Enterprise Ltd., a California-based partnership
that contracts with Arctic Alaska for management and marketing
services, Roberts said.
   Arctic Alaska's 22 other vessels that operate in the Bering Sea
comprise the largest trawler fleet in the region, Roberts said.
   In December 1988 the company lost a trawler in rough weather in
the Bering Sea. Two crew members died when the Arctic II sank,
Roberts said.

   The man considered the father of modern
environmentalism lives in a redwod house, is fascinated by
high-tech equipment and admits he's no Thoreau when it comes to
living his conservationist's vision.
   David Brower presents a large target for his wife, Anne, who
considers his two cars, four color televisions, two video cameras,
three video recorders and dozen tape recorders evidence of rampant
consumerism.
   ``He has been a tremendous consumer of late. I've been
strenuously objecting to that because it costs the Earth,'' she
said. ``But he rationalizes, saying it ill help him in his work to
save the Earth.''
   At 77, the former executive director of the Sierra Club still
lives in his native Berkeley, Calif., and has completed an
autobiography to be published April 22, the 20th anniversary of
Earth Day.
   ``The Life and Times of David Brower'' is dedicated to Anne, his
wife of 46 years and mother of their four children _ two more, he
notes, than the environmentally sound pair.
   But if Brower good-naturedly concedes some personal
inconsistencies, he does so against the backdrop of a stormy
half-century of environmentalism in which he tilted with colleagues
as fiercely as he fought public apathy.
   ``He has been without any question the most effective partisan
in the environmental wars in the whole 20th century,'' said author
Wallace Stegner, who joined the Sierra Club when Brower held the
reins in the early 1950s.
   Brower's boundless energy compels him to attempt things that
often are beyond the financial resources of the groups he supports,
Stegner said.
   Nor is he an organization man, Stegner added. ``It's hard to
deal with him because he's so far ahead,'' Stegner said. ``I'm
really all for Dave, except for in the organization he's sometimes
uncontrollable.''
   Brower knows he's difficult to please. Over the years he's
started 30 environmental organizations that, at the time, best
suited his ideals and methods. Now he seeks to shape the
consciousness of a new generation.
   ``They're not too far gone to be bent,'' he said during a recent
interview in Salt Lake City, where he spoke at the University of
Utah and met with his publisher. ``When I talk to young audiences,
I feel euphoric.
   ``I can't look at a small child and feel good about anything at
all if I don't give that child a chance to grow up.''
   It was childhood expeditions to California's Sierra Nevada that
kindled Brower's love of the outdoors. It grew as his mother's
blindness compelled him to describe the world she could no longer
see.
   Brower's early skirmishes with government and corporate giants
were attempts to preserve wilderness, national parks and endangered
animals. Eventually his battlegrounds came to encompass global
warming, ozone depletion and acid rain.
   Active today as ever, he sits on the boards of the Sierra Club
and Earth Island Institute, which he founded.
   He has come an elder statesman's full circle, returning to the
fight to preserve wilderness.
   His suggested method is to start over, restoring what has been
damaged and protecting what has survived. ``It's Thoreau
thinking,'' he said.
   Brower often is compared in print to the 19th century American
philosopher Henry David Thoreau, who championed wisdom through
association with nature.
   ``We must rise above the frailty and, dammit, it can be done,''
he said. ``We can't go on this way. The resources aren't there to
ransack anymore. We're killing our planet.''
   For all his triumphs, Brower still regrets what he views as his
one spectacular failure. As Sierra Club director he failed to
intervene in time to halt the damming of the Colorado River at
Page, Ariz.
   Southern Utah's Glen Canyon and several of its natural arches
carved by water and wind were lost beneath Glen Canyon Dam's Lake
Powell. The water encroached on Rainbow Bridge National Monument,
but spared the chief attraction.
   Brower wrote of his grief, and guilt, in a 1961 issue of the
Sierra Club Bulletin:
   ``The future may not forgive or understand the citizen who, not
being able to care less, is silent.''

<TEXT>
   The leader of the party that won East
Germany's first free elections today denied allegations that he was
linked to the disbanded Communist secret police and announced his
candidacy for prime minister.
   As recently as Thursday, Lothar de Maiziere of the Christian
Democrats had said his candidacy for the top job depended on the
outcome of talks between his party and others about forming a
coalition government.
   But today, de Maiziere, whose party favors speedy German
reunification and whose campaign was supported by West Germany's
governing conservatives, said at a news conference that he is
willing to head the government.
   Without prompting, he also again denied he was an informer for
the hated Stasi secret police and said he never took money from
them.
   Helmut Lueck, spokesman for de Maiziere's Christian Democrats,
told the news conferece the party leadership opposes a proposed
investigation of legislators elected Sunday to see if they are
linked to the secret police.
   Lueck said such an investigation ``would not serve the interests
of truth and would endanger the inner peace of our country.''
   ``An escalation of mistrust, suspicions and slander is not in
the interest of our young democracy,'' he said.
   Earlier today, East Germany's chief prosecutor rejected a
proposal by church leaders that the investigation be held.
   Dieter Plath, spokesman for chief prosecutor Hans-Juergen
Joseph, said such a probe would be illegal before the new
Parliament is sworn in. He said lawmakers are immune from such
probes, unless Parliament decides otherwise.
   Although other candidates for prime minister had been mentioned,
it was widely expected that de Maiziere would seek the post.
Parliament must meet within 30 days of the election and vote for a
prime minister.
   De Maiziere's three-party Alliance for Germany, which also
includes the Democratic Awakening and the German Social Union,
captured the largest share of seats in the 400-member body but
failed to clinch an absolute majority.
   Alliance officials said they were near an agreement with three
parties close to West Germany's Free Democrats, a junior partner in
the Bonn government coalition. Talks were to continue next week,
according to Democratic Awakening's chairman, Rainer Eppelmann.
   Eppelmann also renewed a coalition offer to the Social
Democrats, who finished second in the balloting. The Social
Democrats agreed to talks but said they would not cooperate with
the German Social Union, the most right-wing party in the Alliance
for Germany.
   Final official election results published today gave the
Alliance for Germany one less seat and one more to the Social
Democrats. The alliance now hold 192 seats, and if they are able to
add the 21 Liberal seats they would have a majority of 213 seats in
Parliament.
   But without the support of the 88 Social Democrats, the ruling
coalition would not have a two-third majority needed to push
through laws that would speed unification.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who backs the alliance and
wants quick unification, on Thursday reiterated calls for a ``grand
coalition'' with the Social Democrats.
   But concern that many newly elected lawmakers may have worked as
informers for the former secret police overshadowed the political
jockeying.
   The government official overseeing the dismantling of the force,
Werner Fischer, said there were suspicions de Maiziere, a lawyer,
collaborated with the Stasi.
   ``There are indications. There is no proof,'' Fischer told West
Germany's ZDF television.
   He said citizens' groups sifting through secret police files in
East German cities made allegations against de Maiziere. Asked
whether he took the allegations seriously, Fischer said, ``Very.''
   During 40 years of rule, the Communists intimidated many people
into collaborating. Until earlier this year, the Stasi had 85,000
agents and hundreds of thousands of informers.
   By official count, about one of every 80 East Germans once
either worked for or cooperated with the force. But many people say
even more were involved in helping longtime Communist leader Erich
Honecker keep the 16.3 million people under firm control.
   Honecker was ousted Oct. 18 following nationwide protests.

<HEAD>Study: No Link Between DPT Vaccine and Neurological Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vaccine commonly administered to youngsters
five times by their fifth birthday does not increase the risk for
epilepsy and other neurological problems, researchers say.
   Previous reports indicated a possible link between one component
of Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus vaccine and such disorders.
   ``Our study provides reassurance to parents that DPT vaccine
does not cause serious diseases of the brain,'' Wayne Ray, an
associate professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt
University, said Thursday.
   DPT vaccine is given to tens of thousands of children each week.
Children typically are immunized three times in their first year of
life, again at about 18 months and for the last time at around 5
years of age.
   The vaccine frequently causes low fevers and some swelling at
the point of immunization.
   Earlier case reports and lawsuits filed by parents against
pharmaceutical companies have alleged that the pertussis, or
whooping cough, component of DPT vaccine has caused seizures and
even death.
   But the study, reported in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association, when seen in conjunction with other recent
studies of the vaccine, should provide great reassurance to parents
that there is no such link, Ray said.
   Ray and the co-authors of his study examined the Medicaid
records of 38,171 Tennessee children who received more than 107,000
DPT immunizations in their first three years of life.
   They compared the rate of neurological events such as seizures
that occurred immediately following immunization with the rate of
such events that occurred 30 or more days after inoculation.
   ``No child who was previously normal without a prior history of
seizures had a seizure in the zero to three days following
immunization that marked the onset of either epilepsy or other
neurological or developmental abnormality,'' the authors wrote.
   Alec Walker, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard
School of Public Health in Boston, said the work appears to confirm
research he has done on the vaccine.
   Walker studied 26,000 children in the Seattle area and found no
increase in any serious neurological problems immediately following
pertussis vaccination. His results appeared in a 1988 issue of the
journal Pediatrics.
   ``The only reasonable interpretation of the data is that there's
an absence of evidence'' for any effect of DPT on serious
neurological disease, Walker said in a telephone interview.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker
III toured this sprawling black township today and blamed apartheid
for its poverty.
   Baker said the contrast between Soweto and the wealth of South
Africa's whites in nearby Johannesburg is ``quite distressing and
that's why I said the system of apartheid should be abolished as
soon as possible.''
   The visit came one day after he said the white-run government
was committed to ending the system of racial separation.
   Baker met with Walter Sisulu at the African National Congress
leaders' home in a neighborhood of small brick houses, visited
community centers, a day-care center, and drove past a squatter's
camp erected on an old golf course.
   Baker then flew to Kinshasa, Zaire, for meetings with President
Mobutu Sese Seko and Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi.
   Baker already has met Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
as part of U.S. efforts to negotiate an end to the Angolan civil
war.
   On Thursday, Baker met with South African President F.W. de
Klerk. A senior U.S. official said Baker told him, ``what he had
done so far was courageous in light of the obvious political
pressures and restraints he is subject to.''
   In February, de Klerk lifted a 30-year ban on the ANC, released
black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela from jail after 27 years,
and announced other reforms aimed at clearing the way for
black-white negotiations.
   Moments before Baker arrived at Sisulu's home, children, perched
on a jungle gym, shouted ANC slogans and sang songs honoring
Mandela. Baker didn't see or hear the children.
   Sisulu said, ``I told the secretary of state we are very
grateful to the people of America for the support they gave us over
the years and that we are hopeful but we are only making a
beginning and we will expect more support as the day goes by.''
   Sisulu's organization publicly opposed Baker's meeting with de
Klerk but the subject wasn't mentioned today until reporters
questioned Sisulu, who appeared to put the issue behind him.
   ``The United States realizes no fundamental change has been made
but that some encouragement should be made. We've had that,''
Sisulu said.
   Before Baker's arrival, the ANC had said Baker's visit, the
first by a U.S. secretary of state in 12 years, would suggest de
Klerk has made fundamental reforms of the apartheid system.
   Despite this difference, ANC leaders greeted Baker warmly during
meetings in Soweto, Cape Town, and in the neighboring country of
Namibia, where he attended independence celebrations.
   Asked about Baker's praise of de Klerk for moving to dismantle
apartheid, Sisulu said, ``Mr. de Klerk is making an effort, which
we appreciate. However, we would like to urge him to a bit speedy
about things.''
   Sisulu said de Klerk has not yet met the ANC's conditions for
negotiations, although the two sides are to hold preliminary talks
April 11.
   The ANC wants the state of emergency lifted and all political
prisoners freed before negotiations begin with the de Klerk
government on sharing power with the nation's disfranchised 28
million black majority.

   Democratic leaders took the offensive today
against President Bush's high approval ratings, accusing the
president of broken promises and timid leadership and vowing to end
his ``free ride.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the vice presidential nominee on
the party's losing 1988 ticket, told the Democratic Leadership
Council that Bush's campaign pledge of no new taxes has become
``pure Bushlips.''
   Bentsen said the administration has proposed an array of
``crypto-taxes'' such as user fees, surcharges and other levies. He
also accused Bush of being too worried about public opinion to help
emerging democracies around the globe.
   ``Can you imagine Harry Truman hesitating to unveil the Truman
Doctrine or the Marshall plan or the Berlin airlift because he
feared public opinion polls? Can you imagine John Kennedy doing a
poll before he dealt with the Cuban missile crisis?'' Bentsen asked.
   The same theme was sounded by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.
   ``Precisely as our principles and values are prevailing
throughout the world, America's trumpet is sounding an uncertain
note,'' Nunn said.
   The often-fractious Democrats were trying to play down their
differences today as two major party groups met in separate cities
to plot strategy for their next attempt to recapture the White
House.
   While the leadership council, dominated by elected officials,
met in New Orleans, the Democratic National Committee was meeting
in Indianapolis.
   Democratic Party Chairman Ronald H. Brown, who was shuttling
between the two meetings, told the New Orleans group that the
Democrats need not be intimidated by Bush's popularity in the polls.
   ``It's time for us to point out that the Bush administration has
been getting a free ride, that we hear a lot of sweet jargon but we
don't see any action,'' Brown said.
   Brown has been one of the most aggressive Democrats in attacking
President Bush, despite the Republican president's high ratings in
opinion polls.
   Bush's 80 percent approval marks are often cited as the reason
few Democrats are making any moves toward challenging him in 1992.
Democrats have lost five of the last six presidential elections.
   The DNC, the party's governing body, was expected to endorse
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's call for a cut in the Social
Security payroll tax.
   In his speech to the leadership council, Brown called Moynihan's
proposal a political ``stroke of genius. Substantively it's a blow
for fairness, a triumph for honesty.''
   Moynihan, D-N.Y., called for a cut in the payroll tax because
the huge surplus that has been stockpiled in the retirement fund is
being used to mask the true size of the federal deficit.
   ``It just makes sense for us Democrats to be on the side of
cutting payroll taxes for working people,'' said Brown, calling the
Social Security tax ``one of the most regressive we have.''
   Brown has expressed annoyance in the past with attacks the DLC's
more conservative members have made on the national party.
   The DLC was formed in 1985 with the avowed purpose of stopping
what many of its founders considered the party's leftward drift.
   As its members prepared to fly to New Orleans, the council
issued a long statement outlining positions on a range of issues,
including the payroll tax.
   Although not specifically endorsing the Moynihan proposal,
members said, ``We cannot continue to allow the cynical use of the
Social Security surplus, raised from a regressive tax on labor, to
mask the true scope of America's fiscal crisis.''
   In a preamble to what they called ``The New Orleans
Declaration,'' the DLC said, ``This is no time for caution and
complacency from our leaders. The measure of a president is not his
standing in the polls, but America's standing in the world.''
   The word ``abortion'' did not appear in the DLC statement, but
the document said ``government should respect individual liberty
and stay out of our private lives and personal decisions.''
   That mirrored the strategy followed by Wilder when he made
abortion an issue in the Virginia governor's race last year. Wilder
framed his pro-choice position as support for a woman's right to
make the decision rather than leave it to government officials.

<TEXT>
   It would seem an impossible task: to adapt for
the stage ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' John Steinbeck's monumental
story of 1930s Dust Bowl farmers and their journey from Oklahoma to
the Promised Land of California.
   Not only does the play have to compete with the powerful prose
of Steinbeck's best novel but with the images of the John Ford film
version that starred Henry Fonda as Tom Joad.
   Yet the play, which opened Thursday at Broadway's Cort Theater,
can stand tall beside the book and the movie. It's an extraordinary
piece of theater, a stirring ensemble production by Chicago's
Steppenwolf Theater Company that rises to and meets the challenge
of Steinbeck's epic tale.
   The hero of the evening is director and adapter Frank Galati who
has fashioned a remarkably coherent version of the Steinbeck story.
True, some of the narrative has disappeared in order to keep the
audience from sitting in the theater all night, but Galati has
remained faithful to the mythic spirit of the novel.
   The essentials are there. The Joad family anchors the play,
particularly the stoic Ma Joad, played by Lois Smith as sort of a
Midwest Mother Courage. She gives a beautiful, heartbreaking
performance. Watch her as she sees Tom for the first time since he
got out of prison or near the end of the play, when he must flee
for his life.
   There are other wonderful portraits in the large, 35-member cast
including Gary Sinise's shrewd, hot-headed Tom; Robert Breuler as
the fatalistic Pa; Jim True as Tom's lusty brother Al; and Sally
Murphy as the life-giving Rose of Sharon. In the play's other major
role, Terry Kinney is fine as the grizzled, cynical preacher turned
labor organizer, a man who may have deserted his church but not his
flock.
   Steinbeck's novel has a relentless rhythm as the Okies push
their way West. Galati and crew have captured that drive perfectly.
What gives the play so much atmosphere is the physical production
the director receives from his design team, especially Kevin Rigdon
who did the evocative sets and lighting.
   The story is played out on a set of weathered wooden planks. But
the setting is not as simple as it initially seems. Various trap
doors are used for campfires. At one point, a trough near the rim
of the stage becomes the Colorado River and during the memorable
scene in a railroad boxcar when Rose of Sharon gives birth to her
stillborn baby, rain pours from near the proscenium arch.
   Then there is the Joad jalopy, loaded down with passengers and
possessions. The old pickup maneuvers around the stage as easily as
if it really were driving along Route 66, the road the Joads took
to California. Their journey westward is accompanied by music
composed and played by Michael Smith and a small band of musicians.
   There is a wondrous moment at the end of Act 1 when the Joads
reach California. A golden glow floods the stage, and the migrants
stand there, transfixed. But unlike the movie, which sinks into a
gooey sentimentality about the nobility of the downtrodden, the
stage version quickly shows the reality of what the Joads found in
their new home. They have traded one form of servitude for another.
   Galati is unstinting in his depiction of the desperation of
these Depression-era homeless. The parallels to the present day are
striking. It's almost uncomfortable to watch their hardships. But
more importantly, it's impossible to forget.

   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: The production at the Cort, an
epic achievement for the director, Frank Galati, and the Chicago
theater ensemble at his disposal, makes Steinbeck live for a new
generation not by updating his book but by digging into its
timeless heart.
   Howard Kissel, the Daily News: There is something heartening
about seeing such a large, deeply committed company engaged in
serious work, but what they achieve is something far below
Steinbeck's galvanizing vision.
   Clive Barnes, the New York Post: This is, overall, a thrilling
theatrical achievement that gets its power from the still sharp
relevance of its human message ... and its entertainment quality
from the performance by an ensemble you should walk miles to see.

<HEAD>PTL Attorneys Say Former Board Members Are Liable for Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL attorneys say former board members,
including actor Efrem Zimbalist Jr., are liable for the $50
million-plus damages suffered by Jim Bakker's former television
empire.
   The board members ``failed to inquire, much less make diligent
inquiry'' into the business affairs of Bakker's PTL television
ministry, the attorneys said in papers filed Wednesday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court without public announcement.
   As a result of that ``wrongful misconduct,'' conditions existed
that caused the Internal Revenue Service to revoke the ministry's
tax-exempt status and claim back taxes of more than $50 million,
the papers allege.
   PTL attorneys are asking the court to force a Pittsburgh
insurance company to make good on its $10 million policy that
covered the board members in the event of legal action against the
ministry.
   National Union Fire Insurance Company is refusing to pay,
claiming that Bakker made a fraudulent misrepresentation when he
took out the policy in 1984.
   Bakker stated at the time that he knew of no pending legal
action against him or PTL. The insurance company said Bakker knew
or should have known that Jessica Hahn was claiming damages from
the minister because of his sexual liaison with her in 1980.
   That incident led to Bakker's resignation from PTL in March
1987. He is serving a 45-year sentence for defrauding his
ministry's supporters out of millions of dollars.
   Zimbalist, who starred in ``The FBI'' television series from
1965 to 1974, was on the PTL board from 1981 to 1986 and testified
at Bakker's trial in September that the board was a sham.
   ``It was called a board of directors, but ... I never assumed I
was responsible for anything because I wasn't,'' he testified. ``It
wasn't that kind of board.''
   Besides Zimbalist, other former PTL board members named in the
action are Charles Cookman, North Carolina district superintendent
of the Assemblies of God; Aimee Cortese, a New York minister; A.T.
Lawing Jr., a retired Charlotte, N.C., businessman; the Rev. Don
George, a Texas minister; Evelyn Carter Spencer, a California
minister; and Ernest Franzone, a retired Florida businessman.
   The claim filed in bankruptcy court said the board members
failed to see that officers and directors were properly supervised,
failed to prevent depletion of corporate assets and allowed a
situation to exist in which officers and directors were
self-dealing with corporate assets.

<HEAD>Black Panther Released Without Bail After Nearly 19 Years in
Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Black Panther Party leader who served
nearly 19 years for allegedly machine-gunning two police officers
has been freed without bail pending a new trial.
   A Manhattan courtroom broke out into shrieks and shouts of
celebration as Dhoruba bin-Wahad, formerly Richard Moore, was
released Thursday.
   He was convicted in the May 19, 1971 wounding of two police
officers who were guarding the home of then-Manhattan District
Attorney Frank S. Hogan.
   State Supreme Court Justice Peter McQuillan, who reversed the
1973 conviction last week, said he was freeing bin-Wahad in his own
recognizance because the prosecution's case against him at this
time appeared weak.
   The judge's decision surprised bin-Wahad, 45, and his lawyers.
Defense attorney Robert Bloom said he had expected the judge to set
bail at $50,000 or more.
   McQuillan said he overturned the conviction because the
prosecution had withheld from the defense relevant information
about prosecution witnesses.
   After hearing the judge's decision, bin-Wahad's wife, Tanaquil
Jones, screamed with joy and then burst into tears. Another one of
his lawyers, Elizabeth Fink, also started to cry with joy.
   Counting the time he served in jail before he was convicted,
bin-Wahad would have served 19 of the minimum 25 years this June 5.
   Outside the court, bin-Wahad told his supporters: ``I would hope
there is another trial to see exactly how little evidence they have
against me.''
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau issued a statement
saying he was displeased about bin-Wahad's release.
   ``We are extremely distressed that the discovery of meaningless
and inculpatory information has provided this defendant with a
basis for overturning a conviction obtained after a fair trial. We
will, of course, press this position in our appeal,'' the statement
said.
   Assistant District Attorney James Kindler told the judge, ``Let
us not forget the crimes which brought us to this courtroom _ the
machine-gunning of two police officers at point-blank range.''
   Kindler told the judge that two weeks after the shooting,
bin-Wahad was arrested with the machine gun in his possession.
   Fink disputed this and suggested that police, FBI agents and
other witnesses lied at bin-Wahad's trial with the prosecution's
blessings.
   Bin-Wahad maintained he was framed and now fears for his safety.
   ``I don't think we're going to live in the United States,'' said
his wife. ``It's not safe here for political activists.''

   A couple saved a 7-day-old
puppy from the belly of a python after they heard faint yelping
inside the snake and forced it to cough up the pet, a newspaper
reported Friday. Two other puppies died.
   Magda and Hennie Botha were quoted as telling The Star newspaper
they heard their terrier barking frantically outside her kennel on
their farm near Nelspruit, 15 miles west of Kruger National Park.
   When they rushed outside, the python was curled up inside the
kennel, the puppies were gone, and the couple said they heard faint
yelps from inside the snake's stomach.
   Botha said while his wife held the snake's tail, he shook the
head up and down and rubbed its bulging stomach. The reptile's jaws
gaped, and out came the three puppies. Two were dead.
   Mrs. Botha massaged the third puppy's chest and moved its front
legs until it began breathing again, The Star said.
   The snake was kept in the bathroom overnight to keep it away
from other animals, then was dropped off several miles away the
next day, the newspaper claimed.

<TEXT>
   Two leaders of a group of thrill-seekers who
jump from high places with elastic cords tied around their ankles
were charged with involuntary homicide in connection with a
jumper's death.
   It was the first such court action in France resulting from the
fad, in which jumpers attach elastic cords to their ankles and to
the base of the platform from which they leap.
   The accident occurred during a festival in eastern France in
June. The government banned elastic-band jumps a month later, then
legalized them again in October after implementing new safety rules.
   The victim of the June 26 accident, Raymond Saputa, 24, was the
72nd person that day to leap from a 180-foot-high crane set up for
jumpers. Saputa's elastic gave way during his second bounce, and he
crashed to the ground.
   A magistrate filed charges Thursday against Marc Gapp, director
of the jumping club, and Bertrand Blancher, a club employee
stationed at the top of the crane to assist jumpers.
   There have been conflicting accounts of why the accident
occurred. According to Blancher, Saputa jumped before he was
supposed to, and the elastic was in the wrong position. According
to a witness on the ground, Blancher detached the elastic
prematurely after Saputa jumped.
   New safety rules were implemented after three jumping deaths in
early 1989. They require all jumpers to undergo heart exams;
require the elastic bands to be changed after every 150 jumps; and
limit the number of jumps per hour from each set of elastic.

   Prosecutors will seek parole for a
North Korean agent convicted of bombing a South Korean jetliner
with 115 people aboard in 1987, newspapers reported Friday.
   Local newspapers said the request would be made to President Roh
Tae-woo next week. Prosecutors refused to comment.
   Kim Hyon-hee, 27, was sentenced to death in connection with the
Nov. 29, 1987 bombing. She said she planted a bomb on the Korean
Air jetliner on orders from North Korean leaders. North Korea
denied involvement.
   Kim and her accomplice, an elderly North Korean man, placed a
sophisticated pair of bombs in the overhead luggage bin of the
Boeing 707, which was flying from Baghdad, Iraq, to Seoul on Nov. 3.
   The bombers got off the plane during a stopover. Several hours
later, it vanished over the sea near Burma.
   After the pair was arrested in Bahrain, the man committed
suicide. Kim's suicide attempt failed, and she was extradited to
Seoul.
   Government officials have said Kim's release would be considered
because she had cooperated in the investigation and fully repented.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has proposed opening
full consular ties with South Korea as a prelude to establishing
formal diplomatic relations, South Korean news reports said Friday.
   The reports said Soviet officials made the proposal Thursday to
Kim Young-sam, leader of South Korea's governing party. Kim arrived
in Moscow on Thursday for a nine-day visit.
   The reports quoted Kim as saying, ``I don't see any reason to
oppose the Soviet proposal.''
   Kim said, however, that South Korea's basic position is to move
directly to formal diplomatic ties without going through an
intermediary step, the reports said.
   In December, the Soviet Union and South Korea opened ``consular
departments'' in their trade offices in each other's capitals and
began limited consular service.
   The arrangement restricts the functions of the departments and
the qualifications of officials working there. The departments
cannot fly national flags, and officials working there are denied
normal diplomatic privileges.
   The Soviet proposal would upgrade the consular departments to
the level of general consulate this summer, a step below full
diplomatic relations, the reports said.
   The Kremlin already has diplomatic relations with Communist
North Korea, South Korea's rival.
   In earlier dispatches, reporters accompanying Kim on the Soviet
trip said the South Korean leader met secretly with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Kremlin.
   Kim refused to confirm or deny the reports. He said, ``I met an
important Soviet figure but I can't disclose who, because I
promised Soviet officials not to make it public now.''
   On Friday, Foreign Minister Choi Ho-joong signed an agreement in
Prague establishing formal diplomatic relations with
Czechoslovakia. Bulgaria's BTA news agency said Friday that South
Korea also established diplomatic ties this week with Bulgaria.
   Last year, Poland and Hungary set up ties with South Korea.

   Demonstrators protesting the
United States' ``interventionist conduct'' in Central American

   One policeman was slightly injured in scuffles that broke out
during the incident. Police spokesman Klaas Wilting said about 200

   A spokesman for the demonstrators said the protest was aimed at
``recent U.S. interventionist conduct in Nicaragua, Panama ... and
an imminent action in El Salvador.''
   The spokesman was referring to U.S. government support for the
anti-Sandinista forces in Nicaragua and the U.S. invasion of Panama
in December. In El Salvador, the United States backs the government
in its civil war with leftist insurgents. The spokesman did not

   Britain's annual inflation rate fell to 7.5
percent in February from 7.7 percent in January, but it is expected
to increase in the coming months, the government said Friday.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major warned in his annual
budget statement Tuesday that inflation would worsen before it
improved. Economists are expecting the annual inflation rate to
move up to 9 percent.
   Major reiterated that fighting inflation with high interest
rates, now at 15 percent, is the government's No. 1 economic
priority.
   The inflation and interest rates, in addition to a new municipal
tax system, have diminished Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
popularity. Her Conservative Party's standing in recent polls was
at its lowest level in years. The report said February food prices
were up 8.6 percent from a year ago, the highest increase since
June 1982. March figures will be boosted by an increase in excise
duties announced in the new budget, and mortgage rate increases.
   The introduction of the new municipal tax, higher water rates
and increases in public housing rents will further boost the retail
price index in April, the office said.

   A convoy of trucks carried 110 tons of
emergency food Friday to a war zone in the northern part of
Ethiopia, but a damaged bridge prevented it from carrying all its
planned load.
   The bridge was not strong enough to handle trucks with trailers
attached, so each truck carried just 10 tons of food instead of the
22 tons that would have been possible with trailers, said Yohannes
Abraham. Abraham is an official of the Catholic Relief Services in
Ethiopia.
   Eleven trucks made the 74-mile journey from the provincial
capital of Dessie over a mountainous road to Kobo.
   Another convoy of 11 trucks covered the same route Monday in
what relief officials said was a trial run. Its drivers reported
the damaged bridge.
   Both trips went without a hitch.
   A consortium of Ethiopian churches is ferrying the food into the
area, which is caught in the conflict between government troops and
the rebel Tigre People's Liberation Front.
   The Tigreans are fighting to oust President Mengistu Haile
Mariam and establish a government patterned after that of Albania,
the last hard-line Marxist state in Eastern Europe.
   The emergency food comes largely from private donors in the
United States and Western Europe. It is intended to feed 1 million
people deprived because of the war and drought.
   A formal cease-fire does not exist, but the rebels and
government have promised safe passage for convoys.
   The church groups hope to extend their distribution network from
the north to southern Eritrea province, where another war is under
way between the government and the secessionist Eritrean People's
Liberation Army.

<TEXT>
   Mongolia's Communist legislators
formally abolished their party's guaranteed monopoly on power
Friday and approved of elections with more than one candidate.
   However, the election law was drafted before Mongolia's recent
pro-democracy protests and does not mention a role for opposition
parties, officials said.
   The 370-seat Hural, Mongolia's parliament, voted 324-10 in favor
of amending two sections of the constitution that say the ruling
Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party is the leading force in
society and the state. The other deputies abstained.
   The changes are in keeping with Mongolia's tendency to follow
the lead of the Soviet Union, where the Communist Party recently
gave up its monopoly on power. Mongolia is the world's second-old
Communist state and is one of the Soviet Union's closest allies.
   Its constitution now says Mongolians have the right to join
parties whose platforms ``correspond to the genuine interests of
the people, in order to build up humane and democratic socialism.''
   The reference to socialism was added after a heated debate in
which many delegates insisted special mention should still be given
to socialism and the ruling party.
   ``The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party has existed nearly
70 years and has a membership of 90,000,'' one irate deputy said.
``It can't be lumped with other parties.''
   Television and radio broadcasts of the proceedings were abruptly
cut off during the debate, but radio broadcasts later resumed in
time for the vote.
   Pro-democracy opposition groups said they would hold a
demonstration Sunday in front of the government palace to demand
the Hural resign. More than 93 percent of the parliament belongs to
the ruling party.
   Opposition groups want a proviional parliament set up with
representation for all parties. This body would amend the
constitution and oversee multi-party elections, according to their
demands.
   ``It's just a joke,'' Ulanhu, of the new Social Democratic
Movement, said of the current Hural.
   Opposition demonstrations began in Mongolia in December, as
pro-democracy revolutions were bringing change to other Soviet bloc
countries. The unrest led the Communist Party and government to
shuffle their top ranks, installing younger officials less closely
tied to the past Stalinist era.
   However, Mongolian opposition groups say the changes are only
cosmetic and intended to placate the public and preserve Communism.
   The Hural, which began its annual session two days ago, accepted
the resignation of three of Mongolia's five deputy prime ministers
Friday. One of the replacements is Kinyat Zardykhan, an economist
who leads a prominent reform faction in the party.
   Friday's session also approved laws allowing appeals when
government officials abuse citizens' civil rights, and providing
for compensation for ``harm caused by investigatory organizations
and public prosecutors.''
   Details of the laws were not available.
   The Hural also passed Mongolia's first foreign investment law.
   The law allows joint ventures with companies of any country,
without limit on the percentage owned by the foreign side.
   As a Soviet bloc state, Mongolia's external investment has come
mainly from Moscow and East European countries.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Allows Guam Women to Seek Abortions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today issued a temporary
restraining order allowing women in this U.S. territory to seek
abortions despite a law banning the procedure.
   The order resulted from a lawsuit filed by Janet Benshoof,
director of the American Civil Liberties Union Reproductive Freedom
Project, Rachael Pine, staff attorney for the project, said from
New York. Pine provided The Associated Press a copy of U.S.
District Judge Alex R. Munson's order.
   Munson scheduled a hearing for Monday at which he will decide
whether to issue a preliminary injunction against enforcement of
the law until the lawsuit is heard in court, according to Pine.
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. It makes it a third-degree felony to
perform abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a woman
to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person to
solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   Gov. Joseph Ada signed the measure into law Monday. It was
unanimously passed March 8 by the territory's Legislature.
   Benshoof was charged Tuesday with a misdemeanor charge of
solicitation to commit abortion after she tested the law by
advising women seeking abortions to travel to Honolulu.
   She pleaded innocent in Guam Superior Court and is free on her
own recognizance. Pine said if the judge grants the preliminary
injuction, the ACLU would have grounds to ask that charges against
Benshoof be dropped.
   Guam is an island in the western Pacific Ocean about 1,500 miles
east of the Philippines.

<TEXT>
   Orders for ``big-ticket'' durable goods rose
3.3 percent last month, the government said Friday, but analysts
said the modest rebound from a record slide in January merely
pointed to continued weakness in manufacturing.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI@McGraw-Hill in Lexinton,
Mass., noted that the February increase followed a 10.7 percent
plunge and said, ``Consequently, we didn't get back everything we
lost.
   ``It's hard to find anything that's really encouraging except
the fact that it didn't fall again,'' she added. ``The industrial
sector doesn't seem to be falling into a deep recession; it's just
far from booming.''
   Robert G. Dederick, chief economist of the Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, agreed, saying: ``The durable goods sector does not show
any sign of sliding over any precipice. It's just in a sideways
shuffle.''
   The Commerce Department said orders to U.S. factories for
durable goods _ items expected to last more than three years _
totaled a seasonally adjusted $121.6 billion.
   The January decline, revised from the originally reported 10.5
percent, was the biggest since the government began keeping track
of such orders 32 years ago and broke the record set in the
recession month of February 1982, when orders plummeted 9.2 percent.
   Transportation orders, which fell 29.4 percent in January and
accounted for most of that month's drop, bounced back 11.2 percent
last month to $30.2 billion.
   `Motor vehicles and parts and shipbuilding and tanks showed
rebounds from last month's sharp declines,'' the department said,
`while aircraft and parts declined for the second month in a row.
Excluding transportation, orders were up 1.0 percent.''
   Unfilled orders declined 0.4 percent, their first drop since
August and only the second since early 1987.
   ``The fact that it's the first negative in seven months is
another indication that things have slowed down,'' said Thomas
Runiewicz of the WEFA Group, an economic forecasting firm in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa.
   Runiewicz also pointed to a 5.7 percent decline in non-defense
capital goods orders, which came on the heels of a 13.7 percent
drop in January.
   ``It shows the investment structure is slowing also,'' he said
of that category of orders, which often is a barometer of business
investment plans.
   Electrical machinery orders rose 4.2 percent to $20.2 billion
after falling 15 percent a month earlier. Orders for non-electrical
machinery, including computers and a variety of industrial
equipment, dropped 1.1 percent to $22.2 billion after advancing 3.0
percent in January.
   Primary metals orders slipped 3.6 percent to $10.7 billion after
a 1.3 percent gain in the preceding month. Steel accounted for most
of the loss.
   The highly volatile orders for defense capital goods jumped 22.6
percent, to $7.95 billion, after plummeting 33.6 percent in
January. Virtually all of the increase came from shipbuilding and
tanks.
   Excluding defense, orders rose 2.2 percent.
   Shipments of durable goods in February increased 5.9 percent to
$123.5 billion, more than offsetting January's 4.4 percent decline.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, right-hand man to
Martin Luther King Jr. during the peak of the civil rights
movement, was hospitalized today for a sodium imbalance, his doctor
said.
   Abernathy was in fair condition in the cardiac unit at Crawford
Long Hospital of Emory University, said his physician, Dr. Robert
Kaufmann. Though Abernathy's heartbeat was being monitored, he was
not suffering from a heart problem, the doctor said.
   Kaufmann said Abernathy's wife called him Thursday night after
Abernathy became lethargic and not as alert as usual, symptoms of a
sodium imbalance called hyponatremia.
   A sodium imbalance can be life-threatening but Abernathy was
responding well to treatment, Kaufmann said.
   ``I don't think he's in great danger at this point,'' the doctor
said, adding that Abernathy was alert this morning.
   Abernathy, the 63-year-old pastor of West Hunter Street Baptist
Church in Atlanta, suffered a stroke in 1983 and again in 1986.
Following the 1983 stroke, he underwent brain surgery.
   Abernathy angered many movement veterans last year when his
autobiography, ``And the Walls Came Tumbling Down,'' contained a
section suggesting that King committed adultery the night before he
was assassinated. A Memphis, Tenn., woman last month sued Abernathy
for libel over the passage.
   Abernathy also drew criticism from some black leaders when he
endorsed Ronald Reagan for president in 1980.
   Abernathy, president emeritus of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, has called King ``the best friend a person
ever had.'' He succeeded King as the head of the SCLC.
   In recent years, Abernathy complained many of the top figures of
the civil rights movement had lost touch with King's ideals. He has
talked about starting a new fight for civil rights.

<HEAD>Government Asked to Bar Ads Equating Pork With Chicken, Fish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pork people say their products are just as
nutritious as chicken, turkey and fish, but a private group says
that's hogwash and is asking the government to do something about
it.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest says an
advertising campaign by the National Pork Producers Council _ it
touts pork as ``the other white meat'' _ is ``deceptive and
dangerously misleading.''
   ``The pork industry is trying to dupe consumers into thinking
that pork is as healthful as chicken, turkey and fish,'' said Bruce
Silverglade, CSPI legal director.
   His group, which also has criticized producers and sellers of
other foods on nutrition issues, filed a petition Friday asking the
Federal Trade Commission to stop the pork council's claims and
require advertising corrections.
   But industry representatives say there's no problem to clean up.
   ``We're confident that our advertising is accurate and can be
backed up by substantial scientific evidence,'' said Barry Pfouts,
director of marketing for the council.
   ``All we have said all along is that our products ... are
nutritionally comparable to other accepted white meats,'' Pfouts
added in defending the ad campaign.
   The center says the industry has gone too far in claims that
pork products are ``low in cholesterol,'' ``low in calories'' and
``low in fat.''
   ``Government data show that almost all cuts of pork are
considerably higher in fat, saturated fat and calories,'' said
Silverglade.
   But Mike Simpson, executive vice president of the Pork Board
said current nutritional assessments of pork are based on
decade-old data that don't take into account recent research and
improvements in breeding.
   Newer information does indicate the fat content in pork is
getting smaller, said Ruth Mathews, who heads the Agriculture
Department's nutrient data research division.
   The department is examining updated nutrition research in an
effort to revise its handbook and table of nutrient composition of
foods. Mathews said final changes are expected by mid-1991.
   ``Early data certainly shows there have been changes in pork
over time since we published the handbook in the early 1980s,'' she
said.
   ``It seems to show that pork is leaner ... that it's lower in
fat content from the early data that we have,'' she added. Those
figures are not publicly available yet.
   The latest information shows the amount of cholesterol in a
4-ounce serving of cooked pork is about the same as for similar
servings of chicken and turkey, said Charles Mitchell, CSPI
spokesman.
   However, Mitchell said the amount and percentage of fat and the
number of calories is substantially higher for pork.
   Mitchell said 4 ounces of pork, trimmed of all visible fat,
averages 14.8 grams or 13 percent fat, while a similar serving of
skinless chicken averages 8.4 grams or 7.4 percent fat. Turkey
weighs in at 2.9 grams or 2.6 percent fat per serving, according to
Mitchell.
   That information indicates the pork ads also violate Agriculture
Department requirements that average servings of ``low-fat'' foods
must be 10 percent or less fat to make the claim, the center said.
   ``We have fat measures of pork as low as 2 percent,'' countered
Pfouts, of the pork producers council.
   The council's research indicates the average 3-ounce serving of
tenderloin, the best cut of pork, is between 3 percent and 4
percent fat while white meat chicken is 3.5 percent.
   Pfouts said that serving of tenderloin has about the same 140
calories as a similar serving of skinless white-meat chicken.
   Mitchell contends similar servings of pork, chicken and turkey
contain 264 calories, 215 calories and 171 calories respectively.
   CSPI said it would also ask Congress to pressure the industry to
increase its spending on research to reduce fat in pork.
   Money for the pork advertising comes primarily from about $25
million collected annually from producers under the 1987 Pork
Promotion and Research Act.
   A House Agriculture subcommittee has scheduled a hearing next
week to review the law.

   An oil tanker on Friday spilled about
small amount of oil into the Delaware River, the Coast Guard said.
   About 150 gallons spilled, authorities said. Earlier, the Coast
Guard and Sun Co. refinery officials had estimated the spill at
1,000 gallons.
   Workers at the Sun refinery dock noticed the spill as the
865-foot tanker Nike was unloading its cargo of Bonney light crude
oil from Nigeria, Petty Officer Joseph Nored said.
   ``We were lucky,'' Sun spokesman Doug Peters said. ``The wind
and tide were with us, keeping the oil right into the dock area.''
   Unloading was stopped and floating booms were placed in the
water around the Singapore-registered ship. A private
anti-pollution contractor also was called in to clean up the spill,
Nored said.
   The spill was reported to the Coast Guard about 6:25 a.m. The
cause of the accident was under investigation, Nored said.

   A CIA employee testified today that John
Poindexter may have withheld some facts from Congress but didn't
try to cover up a shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   The CIA employee, Norman Gardner, appeared as a defense witness
at the trial of Poindexter, the former national security adviser
accused of obstructing Congress, conspiracy and making false
statements in the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``To the best of your knowledge, was Admiral Poindexter
involved'' in obstructing or lying to Congress about the Hawk
shipment? asked defense attorney Joseph Small.
   ``No,'' replied Gardner.
   Gardner acknowledged under questioning, however, that Poindexter
never told the House intelligence committee or Sens. David
Durenberger and Patrick Leahy on Nov. 21, 1986, that President
Reagan had ratified the Hawk shipment.
   Poindexter tore up the presidential document authorizing the
delivery hours after meeting separately with the House committee
and then the senators.
   ``Didn't you speak up'' when Poindexter omitted some facts in
his congressional meetings? asked Iran-Contra prosecutor Christian
Mixter.
   ``No ... I just don't do that,'' replied Gardner.
   Poindexter told the congressmen Reagan didn't approve the Hawk
shipment, according to Gardner's notes of the meeting.
   Gardner knew about the presidential authorization, said Mixter.
   Gardner recalled that Durenberger was hostile to Poindexter at
the start of their Nov. 21, 1986, meeting on the Iran initiative.
   ``John, if you are not going to give us all the facts we're
going to get the hell out of here,'' Gardner quoted Durenberger as
saying.
   On Thursday, former Attorney General Edwin Meese III said
``everything I know'' suggests Poindexter tried to get the facts
out about a shipment of missiles to Iran.
   Testifying as a defense witness at Poindexter's trial, Meese
said he never suspected the national security adviser might be
concealing from Congress the CIA's role in the arms shipment.
   ``Did Admiral Poindexter ever tell you a lie?'' defense attorney
Richard Beckler asked.
   ``Not to my knowledge,'' Meese replied.
   Asked whether Poindexter tried to ``convey an accurate'' story
on the missile shipment, the former attorney general replied:
``Everything I know about it is he did.''
   ``Did you know that Admiral Poindexter'' was ``involved in that
Hawks shipment?'' prosecutor Dan Webb asked.
   ``No, I did not know that then and I do not know that today,''
Meese replied.
   Webb showed Meese a copy of a Nov. 20, 1985, computer message
from White House aide Oliver North to Poindexter about the
impending shipment. Meese responded by saying ``I don't know
whether'' Poindexter received it when North sent it to him.
   Meese attended a Nov. 20, 1986 meeting in Poindexter's office,
where North adopted a cover story that no one in the U.S.
government knew at the time that Hawk missiles were aboard an air
shipment.
   Asked by Beckler whether he had heard any discussion of a false
cover story at the meeting, the former attorney general replied:
``No, I did not. I am sure nothing like that was ever said in my
presence at that meeting.''
   Meese said Poindexter asked him to attend the meeting to ensure
Reagan administration officials could testify `truthfully and
accurately'' to Congress about the Iran initiative.
   Webb asked Meese whether he wasn't suspicious about the
assertions of lack of U.S. knowledge after discovering two days
after the meeting that the Reagan document, known as a finding, had
ratified the missile shipment.
   ``No, I was not suspicious of that,'' said Meese. He explained
that the CIA said it had discovered that Hawks were aboard only as
the shipment was under way and the finding was signed by Reagan a
week and a half after the delivery.
   When Meese told Reagan on Nov. 21, 1986 a fact-finding inquiry
would be launched of the Iran initiative, did Poindexter ``jump
up'' and say he had a copy of the finding in his safe? Webb asked.
   ``No, he did not,'' said Meese.
   ``During this time ... did John Poindexter ever tell you he had
destroyed this finding that had been signed by the president of the
United States?'' the prosecutor asked.
   ``No,'' Meese replied.

   This suspected burglar really did go out on
a limb. That's were police officers and tracking dogs located him,
perched on a branch hanging over Horeshoe Lake.
   The man fled Thursday after neighbors saw him and an accomplice
trying to break into a vacant house, authorities said.
   The accomplice was caught. The other suspect ran into the woods
and climbed the tree when he saw the officers approaching.
   ``He was taunting the dogs and the police,'' Capt. Jack Fields
of the Madison County sheriff's department said. ``The limb broke
and he fell into the water.''
   The man stayed in about 4 feet of chilled water for about 90

Deputy Gerry Owens.
   Both suspects, whose identities were not released, were taken to
the Madison County Jail.

   The cleanup continues in Prince William
Sound a year after the Exxon Valdez struck a charted reef and
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil.
   Exxon Corp. said last week that this year's cleanup will be
smaller than last summer's $2 billion effort.
   A multi-agency group is to conduct a shoreline survey in April
and turn in a work plan by May 1, said Otto Harrison, Exxon Alaska
operations manager.
   ``Work will start the first of May or as soon as weather will
permit,'' Harrison said.
   Exxon said more than 25 studies have been done during the
winter, most showing significant shoreline improvement, excellent
water quality, no missing species and no stressed animals.
   Still, an estimated 120 miles of beaches need cleaning,
authorities said.
   The company will use clean-up techniques this summer ``less
intrusive on the environment'' than the hot water and steam-hose
baths last year.
   They include using oil-eating bacteria and removing the oiled
sediment.
   ``To dig it up is the most intrusive thing you can do,''
Harrison said. ``We don't know if the benefits are worth it.''
   The 987-foot tanker became impaled on Bligh Reef on March 24,
1989, after veering away from normal shipping lanes to avoid
floating ice.
   The resulting hemorrhage of crude from the tanker created the
nation's worst oil spill. The oil tarred hundreds of miles of rocky
shoreline, killed countless birds, animals and marine life.
   On Thursday, Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood was convicted
of a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil and cleared
of felony criminal mischief and two other misdemeanors.

<HEAD>Thatcher's Party To Continue Anti-Inflation Policies Despite
Election Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Friday she
will press on with unpopular anti-inflationary policies despite her
Conservative Party's most stunning by-election defeat in 50 years.
   ``We are not a fair-weather party. We are not for trimming and
turning,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in a letter to party chairman Kenneth
Baker after Thursday's upset. The letter was released by the party
headquarters.
   The opposition Labor Party scored a landslide victory in the
previous Tory stronghold of Mid-Staffordshire in central England.
Labor leaders declared that 11 years after being ousted by Mrs.
Thatcher, they are on course to return to power.
   In Mid-Straffordshire, Labor candidate Sylvia Heal, a social
worker, took 49 percent of the vote. The Conservatives' Charles
Prior got 33 percent, while other parties took the rest of the
votes.
   The one-seat loss scarcely dented Mrs. Thatcher's control of the
650-member House of Commons, where she has an overall 100-seat
majority. But the by-election rout raised new uncertainties about
her political future.
   Recent straw polls have indicated a significant minority of the
Tory members of the House of Commons _ who elect the party leader
each fall _ want her to retire before the next election. It must be
held by mid-1992.
   Her party and personal ratings are slumping largely because of
soaring home loan rates and a new local tax, which will replace
property taxes starting April 1 and increase what many Britons pay
the government.
   Some senior Tories acknowledge the new tax, formally known as a
community charge, has been a blunder.
   ``The government has got to be a lot more sensitive ... there
have got to be changes in the community charge,'' said Tory
legislator John Lee in a radio interview.
   Lee's north England district, Pendle, is among 76 highly
vulnerable Tory constituencies held by majorities of few thousand
votes or less.
   Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock said the victory Thursday was a
turning point for the Conservatives, who ``are going to have to
make up their minds how quickly they get rid of Mrs. Thatcher.''
   ``Her leadership is misleadership, and the sooner she goes the
better,'' he said on British Broadcasting Corp. TV. ``We will
defeat any Conservative leader at the next election.''
   The Conservatives, 10 points ahead in opinion polls a year ago,
are now 21 points behind Labor. It is the biggest deficit since
Mrs. Thatcher won a third consecutive term in 1987.
   Government popularity has waned steadily as the Thatcher
administration doubled interest rates to 15 percent in less than
two years to try to curb resurgent inflation. But inflation is more
than 7 percent, among the highest of major industrialized nations.
   The government is banking on inflation to start falling next
year in time to lower interest rates before it has to call an
election.

Thatcher, they are on course to return to power.
   In Mid-Straffordshire, Labor candidate Sylvia Heal, a social
worker, took 49 percent of the vote. The Conservatives' Charles
Prior got 33 percent, while other parties took the rest of the
votes.
   The one-seat loss scarcely dented Mrs. Thatcher's control of the
650-member House of Commons, where she has an overall 100-seat
majority. But the by-election rout raised new uncertainties about
her political future.
   Recent straw polls have indicated a significant minority of the
Tory members of the House of Commons _ who elect the party leader
each fall _ want her to retire before the next election. It must be
held by mid-1992.
   Her party and personal ratings are slumping largely because of
soaring home loan rates and a new local tax, which will replace
property taxes starting April 1 and increase what many Britons pay
the government.
   Some senior Tories acknowledge the new tax, formally known as a
community charge, has been a blunder.
   ``The government has got to be a lot more sensitive ... there
have got to be changes in the community charge,'' said Tory
legislator John Lee in a radio interview.
   Lee's north England district, Pendle, is among 76 highly
vulnerable Tory constituencies held by majorities of few thousand
votes or less.
   Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock said the victory Thursday was a
turning point for the Conservatives, who ``are going to have to
make up their minds how quickly they get rid of Mrs. Thatcher.''
   ``Her leadership is misleadership, and the sooner she goes the
better,'' he said on British Broadcasting Corp. TV. ``We will
defeat ny Conservative leader at the next election.''
   The Conservatives, 10 points ahead in opinion polls a year ago,
are now 21 points behind Labor. It is the biggest deficit since
Mrs. Thatcher won a third consecutive term in 1987.
   Government popularity has waned steadily as the Thatcher
administration doubled interest rates to 15 percent in less than
two years to try to curb resurgent inflation. But inflation is more
than 7 percent, among the highest of major industrialized nations.
   The government is banking on inflation to start falling next
year in time to lower interest rates before it has to call an
election.

   Glasnost and perestroika may have brought change
to much of the socialist world, but at China's annual people's
congress the magic word is ``wending'' _ stability.
   It is repeated in speeches, discussions and interviews at this
year's National People's Congress, the Communist-dominated
parliament.
   Premier Li Peng set the tone in his keynote address Tuesday.
``Now, as we confront pressure from abroad and difficulties at
home, preservation of the country's stability is a matter of
paramount importance,'' he said.
   Each citizen, he told the 2,700 deputies, ``should cherish the
hard-won political stability and unity as he would treasure his own
life.''
   Song Ping, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, told
the lawmakers: ``History has taught us that nothing can be achieved
without a stable situation.''
   The spokesman for the congress, Yao Guang, said political
reforms would be ruled out if they ``affect the stability of the
situation.''
   The passion for stability reflects the insecurities of the
aging, unpopular Chinese leadership. They fear the disintegration
of socialist values and institutions around the world. They fear
the reform movement crushed by tanks last June will revive and
students will return to the streets with their pro-democracy
demands. They fear a populace made restless by poor working and
living conditions. And they remember China's historical lessons
that anarchy brings suffering.
   ``Common people truly want to see the country stable. They have
suffered enough from the turmoil, and if the country is plagued
with chaos, it is the common people who will suffer,'' one Beijing
delegate was quoted as saying.
   His sentiments are shared by most Chinese who have a cultural
aversion to the privations brought on by thousands of years of
internal upheavals. Many lived through the economic madness of Mao
Tse-tung's 1958 Great Leap Forward and the hysteria of the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution.
   But the party is now preaching ``stability'' to further its own
ends. It is demanding unquestioned acceptance of the status quo,
with its ban on political opposition to one-party rule and
obedience to the leaders.
   Stability means forsaking new market-oriented reforms and
clamping more state controls over the economy. ``Stability takes
precedence over everything,'' the Beijing Daily quoted deputy Tao
Dayong, a well-known economist, as saying.
   ``Otherwise the economy will not have the necessary environment
to development,'' he said.
   Stability also translates into crackdowns on the corrupt and
criminal, and suppression of labor unrest, a byproduct of economic
austerity measures that have led to plant closings and rising
unemployment.
   ``Only with stability can the country preserve the results
achieved through reforms in the past decade,'' trade union official
and Shanghai deputy Wu Huifang told the Xinhua News Agency.
   The official press has made certain no social group is left out.
It quoted Li Hong, a law student at Beijing University, as saying
``almost every university student in China desires social and
political stability.''
   Doje Cering, government chief in Tibet, told the congress, ``We
Tibetans who have suffered enough from the turmoil of the Cultural
Revolution and riots in recent years understand the importance of
political and social stability.''
   Wu Yuqian, a deputy representing the People's Liberation Army,
said ``last year, some people talked a lot about new concepts and
new thinking and they mocked those who talked Marxism and Leninism.
Now things have changed, people believe in Marxism and Leninism
again.''
   That's the message Premier Li hammered home in his concluding
remark to the congress. ``Foreign forces hostile to China that
engage in subversive activities are bound to fail,'' Li said.
``Come what may, socialist China will stand rock firm in the East.''

   President Bush today intensified his campaign
for his stalled $800 million Central American aid package, saying
``with democracy at stake, we really cannot afford delay.''
   Bush prodded Congress on the package, both in opening remarks at
a White House luncheon with out-of-town newspaper editors and
reporters and during an earlier meeting with Panamanian Vice
President Guillermo Ford.
   He told the news representatives it was ``a matter crucial to
the future of democracy in this hemisphere.''
   ``Panama and Nicaragua stand in a historic moment on the
threshold of democracy. In both nations, the people have spoken in
favor of freedom. But the difficult work of democracy-building
remains,'' Bush said.
   He said the western hempisphere ``can become the first where
democracy prevails from north to south. But it cannot happen if we
in the United States fail to add our strength and support to the
forces of democracy. ...with democracy at stake, we really cannot
afford delay.''
   Earlier, during a White House picture-taking session in the Oval
Office with the Panamanian vice president, Bush said, ``We'll keep
pushing from our end.''
   ``It is absolutely essential that the Congress move to pass this
legislation that will bring urgent, needed help to Panama,'' Bush
said.
   It was the second time in as many days Bush has prodded Congress
on the package, which he has said must be passed by the end of the
month.
   On Thursday Bush criticized congressional Democrats who are
seeking to shift some of the money to new democracies in Eastern
Europe.
   Ford, one of the leaders the United States installed in December
after it invaded Panama and toppled the government of Manuel
Antonio Noriega, told Bush: ``We are liberated, now we're free. And
we're ready to put our act together.''
   The Panamanian official, speaking in English, said Panama's $500
million share of the aid package ``will allow us to put the show on
the road and not have to come back every year, knocking on doors,
asking for additional help.''
   Ford said the package would ``jump start'' the Panamanian
economy.
   The remaining $300 million of the package would go to Nicaragua.
   Bush told his White House visitor, ``I hope you will tell your
colleagues when you go back that anything we can do to help, we
want to do it. I want to assure you, the priorioty is passage of
this legislation.''
   He commended Ford for his work in lobbying members of Congress.
``I understand you saw 102 senators, which is pretty good'' since
there are only 100 of them, Bush joked. ``Maybe it just felt like
that.''
   Ford responded: ``It has been absolutely wonderful up on the
Hill. I think all the congressmen and the senators have been just
very understanding of our need. We have expressed the necessity of
doing it as rapidly as possible.''

   It was not clear how many journalists would be affected, whether
the order applied to correspondents who have been in Lithuania for
some time or whether any deadline was imposed.
   As the Soviets tried over the last few days to maintain
authority in the Baltic republic the story of Lithuanian defiance
of Moscow has attracted growing attention from the media.
   President Bush is expected to make a strong statement of protest
shortly. Until now, he has guided the administration through a
period of admonitions to Moscow not to use force. But U.S. rhetoric
has been low-keyed in an effort not to heighten tensions in a
touchy situation.

   The world offered Lithuania some cautious words of
support this week but no formal recognition of its independence,
apparently wary of coming down too hard on Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   Most governments urged Moscow not to try to solve the problem by
force or threats and appealed to it to negotiate with the
Lithuanians.
   Several said that since they had never accepted the Soviet
annexation of Lithuania in 1940, there was no need for them to take
action now.
   For many countries, especially Western democracies, the
situation posed a quandary: how to acknowledge the Lithuanian
people's right to freedom without hurting Gorbachev and his reform
program.
   The Soviet republic declared independence from the Soviet Union
on March 11.
   On Thursday, it appealed for worldwide support after Gorbachev
ordered Lithuanians to turn in their guns and disband their
volunteer defense force. Soviet troop movements in recent days
appeared to be a show of force.
   Sweden, across the Baltic Sea, put its military on a higher
state of alert and said it was urging Moscow to rule out military
action.
   Lithuania's appeal drew a sympathetic response from the U.S.
Senate. It voted 93-0 Thursday night for a resolution urging Bush
to consider the republic's request for diplomatic relations.
   While Washington has not extended formal recognition, it also
never recognized the forced incorporation of Lithuania into the
Soviet Union.
   Bush on Friday warned the Soviet Union that any attempt to
intimidate or use force against the breakaway republic ``is bound
to backfire. That is inevitable.''
   He coupled his statement with a declaration that the United
States stands with the people of Lithuania ``and supports their
right to self-determination.''
   In a statement late Thursday, Norwegian Foreign Minister Kjell
Magne Bondevik expressed the Nordic countries' concern.
   ``We urgently appeal to the Soviet side to abstain from
military, political or economic pressure,'' he said. ``Only patient
negotiation and constructive dialogue will make it possible to
solve the great challenge both parts are facing.''
   Late Thursday, the Danish Foreign Ministry appealed to the
Soviet Union to ensure ``that negotiations with Lithuania take
place without pressure or threats.''
   Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens said: ``President
Gorbachev has a chance to show he is a true democrat and wants to
take into account the will of the Lithuanian people.''
   Denmark, Norway, Britain, Belgium, Italy and Switzerland are
also among governments that said they had never recognized the
Soviet annexation of Lithuania and neighboring Estonia and Latvia
in 1940.
   But all said it was too early to consider other official action,
such as sending ambassadors to Vilnius. Swiss Foreign Minister Rene
Felber said the declaration does not mean de facto independence.
   U.S. and Swedish officials said independence implies control of
territory, which Lithuania does not have.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told Parliament on
Tuesday: ``We recognize especially that Lithuania has expressed a
wish to determine her own future. We hope that the position will be
satisfactorily resolved between those who express that wish and
President Gorbachev.''
   On Thursday, the Polish Parliament passed a resolution
expressing hope that the process of restoring Lithuania's
independence would progress quickly.
   France, which also never recognized Lithuania's annexation,
hoped for ``new relations'' between the Soviet Union and Lithuania.
It noted that ``the free choice (by Lithuanians) ... was made
possible by the democratization reforms undertaken by Mr.
Gorbachev.''
   The two German governments made no comment. Nor did Yugoslavia,
which has its own problems with separatists.
   Spain and the Netherlands noted that when they finally
recognized the Soviet Union decades after the Communist revolution,
Lithuania was already annexed by Moscow. Therefore, they argued,
Soviet consent would be a key factor in deciding whether to
recognize Lithuanian independence. Spain said it was ``a moment for
caution,'' and it was waiting for the 12-nation European Economic
Community to adopt a position.
   ``We must try to help in any way possible so that the conflict
over independence does not perturb the overall positive reforms
initiated under Mr. Gorbachev's perestroika policy of economic and
political restructuring,'' the Spanish Foreign Ministry said.
   Philippines Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus noted that many
countries have separatist movements and ``a very cautious approach
is needed.''
   Thai government spokesman Suvit Yodmanee said Lithuanian
independence was a Soviet internal affair. Government officials in
conservative Persian Gulf Arab states said it is their policy not
to interfere in the internal affairs of any state.

   The Idaho Legislature's approval of the most
restrictive state abortion law sets the stage for a possible test
of the U.S. Supreme Court's commitment to legalized abortion.
   ``The people of Idaho have said strongly what millions of
Americans believe, that abortion is not an acceptable means of
birth control,'' said National Right to Life Committee legislative
director Doug Johnson.
   But the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood
announced they would challenge the measure if it becomes law.
   ``It's got a wide-ranging impact beyond the understanding of the
people who voted for this here,'' said Jack Van Valkenburgh of the
ACLU.
   The ACLU sued today to challenge an even more restrictive law
banning abortions in Guam, and a federal judge in the U.S.
territory agreed to block enforcement of the new law until a
hearing Monday.
   In Maryland, meanwhile, the Senate approved an unusual
compromise today to break an eight-day filibuster: An abortion
rights bill permitting unrestricted abortions during the early
stages of pregnancy will become law unless it is petitioned to
referendum and rejected by voters in November.
   If it is rejected, then a bill sponsored by anti-abortion
senators will become law _ unless it also is defeated by voters.
Under that bill, abortions could be performed in cases of rape or
incest, to protect the mother's life or if the pregnancy would
produce serious and adverse effects on the woman's health.
   The measures are structured so that both would have to be passed
by the House and signed by the governor; if one of the measures is
rejected, the other one dies.
   The Idaho bill was patterned on a National Right to Life
Committee model that has been rejected by other states as too
restrictive. But it is the version that abortion foes want for the
test of the U.S. Supreme Court's commitment to its 1973 Roe vs.
Wade decision that legalized abortion.
   The law would make abortion illegal except in cases of
non-statutory rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim
is younger than 18, severe fetal deformity or a threat to the
mother's life or physical health.
   An abortion would be illegal in the case of statutory rape, or
sex with a minor, on grounds that such behavior implies consent on
the part of the female, said Democratic Sen. Claire Weatherell, a
supporter of the bill.
   If it is signed by Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus, the measure
would take effect July 1. Andrus has declined to announce his
intentions on the bill but has reiterated his long-held
anti-abortion stand.
   Hundreds of telephone calls, messages and letters flooded the
governor's office as lobbying by both camps in the abortion debate
shifted to Andrus after Thursday's 25-17 state Senate vote
approving the ban on abortion as a method of birth control. The
legislation cleared the House two weeks ago.
   Abortion rights advocates in the Senate said the state was
running up a futile legal bill of up to $1 million in passing a
measure that would not withstand the high court's scrutiny.
   They also labeled the bill a draconian product of an
out-of-state organization pushing its own agenda.
   ``This bill challenges values ingrained in Idaho's tradition _
freedom of belief, freedom of action, freedom of privacy,'' said
Democratic Sen. Marti Calabretta.
   But the bill's supporters said the only issue was whether the
state would take the lead in protecting the lives of unborn
children.
   ``Abortion is the destruction of life, and what can we say about
the future of our society when defenseless victims are destroyed
for the convenience of personal choice,'' Republican Sen. Roger
Madsen said.
   The potential legal bill ``is a very, very inexpensive cost for
the life of a child,'' said Democratic Sen. Jim Christiansen.
   Andrus remained silent about his intentions on the abortion ban,
standing on his recent affirmation of his long-held opposition to
abortion except in the case of rape, incest or to save the life of
the woman.
   Kerry Uhlenkott of Right to Life of Idaho said she was confident
the governor would maintain his anti-abortion credentials.
   ``Idaho is speaking out on this issue,'' she said. ``I don't
think he will ignore it.''
   But leaders of the fledgling Freedom Means Choice, formed two
months ago as the Idaho debate was heating up, refused to give up
the battle against a bill that would ban more than 90 percent of
the 1,500 abortions performed in Idaho each year.
   ``The word is not dejected,'' said Sally Trott. ``The word is
determined. I don't believe anyone can state what the governor will
do.''
   At the White House, President Bush said the vote was a state
matter but added, ``I have not changed my position at all.'' Bush's
opposition to abortion mirrors that of the governor's.

   World peace through bureaucracy: It's
an idea whose time may have come. After all, the paperwork isn't
ready, says the president of the International Association of
Professional Bureaucrats.
   ``Think of the possibilities,'' said James H. Boren. ``We can
move closer to preserving the red tape that binds the world
together as one great harmonic unit.''
   If U.S. and Soviet military bureaucrats can be brought together,
well, war couldn't possibily break out because there would be
``peace through inertia,'' Boren said.
   His tongue-in-cheek group, known as INATAPROBU, was formed 22
years ago to poke fun at bureaucrats. On Thursday, it honored
President Bush with its first ``Bureaucrat of the Decade'' award,
Boren said.
   ``In 33 years as an observer of presidents, prime ministers, and
non-directive leaders around the world, I have never seen
bureaucratic excellence that would surpass that of President George
Bush,'' he said.
   ``As both the environmental president and the education
president, he has based his leadership on the same scientific
principle which made the thermos bottle a commercial success,''
Boren read in a deep drawl.
   Boren, a beefy Oklahoman with a long list of government jobs
behind him, was a featured speaker at ``Frontier Thinking,'' a
three-day conference to find ways to reconcile industrial profits
with the environment.
   ``We believe that progress is our greatest mistake. We believe
that nothing should be done for the first time.'' Boren said. ``We
believe that the status quo is too progressive, and that's why
we're here at this conference.''
   He expressed shock at the conference's agenda. ``Creativity!''
he spat in a rare display of emotion. ``We accept creativity, as
long as it's creativity with narrowly established guidelines, and
it protects us.''
   ``But a lot of things we've been hearing at this conference is
about changing things. Why, that's shocking. With change, we're
liable to have movement, and with movement we're going to get
mistakes.''
   ``Doing nothing and doing it with style. That's what we're all
about,'' he said.
   His entourage included a Soviet protege, Leonid Florentiev, the
international editor of the Soviet humor magazine ``Krokodil,'' who
would be establishing ``an affiliate office in Moscow,'' Boren said.
   It will be called the Soviet Academy of Bureaucratic Arts, or
AKABURIS, Florentiev said in a thick Russian accent.
   `It is the most bureaucratic nation in the world,'' Florentiev
said, his face flushed with pride. ``It goes back to Ivan the
Terrible'' who got his name because he was a terribly good
bureaucrat, Florentiev said.
   There is much INATAPROBU can learn from AKABURIS once the latter
gets going with Florentiev at the helm as ``chief of protocol,''
Boren said.
   With INATAPROBU members already at desks in 38 nations, Soviet
involvement would permit preliminary orbital implementation of a
bureaucratic apparatus that no system could crack and change,
Florentiev said.
   ``We could have bureaucrats moving from country to county, a
well-coordinated bureaucratic exchange'' that would freeze the
entire planet into a memo-writing status quo, Boren observed.
   AKABURIS, like INATAPROBU, will have powers to confer the Order
of the Bird awards on good bureaucrats.
   The award, a sculpture of a naked, pot-bellied bird, is
conferred to bureaucrats able to ``blotate with optimal pappetry,
fuzzify, zichify, respond with assentiality, develop rationale for
non-reccurrence, innovate within established guidelines, and delay
by sending to general counsel.''

   President Bush warned the Soviet Union today
that any attempt to intimidate or use force against the breakaway
republic of Lithuania ``is bound to backfire. That is inevitable.''
   Bush coupled his statement with a declaration that the United
States stands with the people of Lithuania ``and supports their
right to self-determination.''
   Administration officials said the Soviet Union today ordered
foreign diplomats and at least some journalists to leave Lithuania,
as tensions between Moscow and the secession-minded republic
mounted.
   The two U.S. diplomats in Vilnius were given 12 hours to depart
and will comply, the officials said. Diplomats from other countries
also were instructed to leave, but the officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said they did not know how many were
involved.
   Soviet armor rumbled through the Lithuanian capital's streets on
Thursday, prompting concern that increasing Kremlin pressure would
lead to violence.
   Bush told a White House gathering, ``Any attempt to coerce or
intimidate or forcibly intervene against the Lithuanian people is
bound to backfire. That is inevitable.''
   Bush spoke about Lithuania as he opened a news conference with
editors and reporters from out-of-town news media.
   Declaring solidarity with Lithuanians, Bush said, ``this is a
complex and sensitive time, when realistic, levelheaded leadership
is required on all sides.
   ``Lithuanian leaders have consistently demonstrated their
capacity in this rgard, and the United States will do nothing that
will make their task more difficult,'' he said.
   ``We know the Soviet Union has a longstanding interest in
Lithuania but those interests can only be addressed through
dialogue and negotiations,'' Bush said.
   Responding to a question, Bush said he had not seen any
intelligence suggesting ``some kind of conflagration over the
weekend'' in Lithuania.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``it is a matter of considerable tension.
I hope those tensions can be released through negotiation.''
   On other subjects, the president:
   _ Said that ``I don't think this is the time to change the
policy on sanctions'' on South Africa, even though he has been
reviewing the sanction issue within his own administration and with
congressional leaders. He said dates have not yet been set on
visits to the White House of South African President F.W. deKlerk
or black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela.
   _ Said his administration would be delighted to help ``a
democratically elected government in Cuba'' if one ever emerges.
However, Bush added, ``Castro has not changed. Indeed, he is
swimming against the tide.''
   _ Defended spending money to aid new democracies instead of
putting more into domestic programs, saying it was important to
``help create stable democracies that will actively trade with the
United States.''
   _ Said the federal government should not set itself up as a
censor of controversial art, but declared, ``I am deeply offended
by some of the filth that I see and to which federal money has gone
and some of the sacrilegious, blasphemous depictions that are
portrayed by some to be art.''
   He said he had seen ``two horrendous examples of what I would
call blasphemous material that has no business of getting one cent
of the taxpayers' money.'' Bush did not identify the artists or
their works.
   _ Said his administration is looking into ways of shifting
shipping lanes off the coast of California to keep oil tankers
further away from beaches. He said it was impossible to deny access
to tankers to West Coast ports, but said ``we can go the extra mile
in terms of environmental protection.''
   _Declared himself opposed to statehood for the District of
Columbia. ``This is a federal city and my view is it should remain
that,'' he said. ``Put me down as unsympathetic to that particular
cause.''
   Bush also discussed Lithuania at a news conference Thursday,
saying he was pleased Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
had said Moscow would not use force.
   ``Please continue to exercise that kind of restraint. And
remember, no use of force,'' Bush said.
   He called on the Kremlin and Lithuanians to negotiate their
differences.
   ``They should talk about that,'' Bush said when asked about
Gorbachev's demand that the republic's citizens surrender their
personal firearms. ``My appeal would again be peaceful resolution
through discussion of this difficult question.''
   Bush said it would be ``presumptuous and arrogant'' for him to
get more detailed and say which side should initiate talks.
   The State Department was more critical of the Soviet moves.
   ``We're concerned by the order to have internal security and
secret police troops seize private sporting guns unless they are
surrendered,'' department spokesman Richard Boucher said.

<HEAD>Bush, Panamanian Vice President Urge Congress to Pass Aid Measure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   President Bush stepped up pressure Friday for
Congress to pass his $800 million aid package for Panama and
Nicaragua, stating, ``We really cannot afford delay.''
   Bush's campaign included an Oval Office meeting with Panamanian
Vice President Guillermo Ford, who has been lobbying Congress to
approve the aid. The package includes $500 million for
invasion-wracked Panama and $300 million for Nicaragua's newly
elected government.
   ``Panama and Nicaragua stand at a historic moment on the
threshhold of democracy,'' Bush told a luncheon of regional news
editors. ``In both nations the people have spoken in favor of
freedom but the difficult work of democracy building remains.''
   In pushing publicly for the package for the second day in a row,
Bush tried to counter sentiment among some Congress members that
the needs of two small countries should not get priority in light
of U.S. wishes to help the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
   U.S. aid to Eastern Europe is important, Bush said. But he
added, ``There is work to be done, work that I feel is every bit as
important in support of democracy right here in our own
hemisphere.''
   Ford said he had met with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., one of the
leading critics of the Latin Ameria special assistance package.
Leahy has said the money is too much for two small countries, even
though their dire economic straits are due in significant part to
past U.S. policies.
   Ford said Leahy ``has his own views and I respect them... I
think he will be reviewing his own ideas and I sincerely hope that
he will back up Panama because we do need the assistance.''
   He also told reporters outside the White House that Panama was
not going to compete with the Eastern European countries for aid.
But he noted that $14 billion in international aid is slated for
Poland, and the $500 million Bush is seeking for Panama represents
``a matter of an inadequate proportion.''
   Bush said during a photo session with Ford that passage of the
aid package is ``absolutely essential.'' He is seeking passage by
April 6, when Congress leaves for its Easter recess.
   Told that Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell had expressed
doubts the package could pass by then, State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said the aid is ``an urgent need in Panama. It's an
important package, a well-studied package.''
   The president again stated that if Congress cannot agree on
places to cut the defense budget to pay for the aid package, ``I`m
ready to make the hard choices.
   ``With Congress' authorization ... I am ready to select offsets
from the defense budget, break the logjam and get these much needed
resources moving into the region. With democracy at stake, we
really cannot afford delay.''
   Ford said the aid would help Panama ``jump start'' its economy
and ``will allow us to put the show on the road and not have to
come back every year, knocking on doors, asking for additional
help.''
   The United States installed Ford and President Guillermo Endara
in December after Bush sent invasion troops to topple dictator Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``We are liberated. Now we're free. And we're ready to put our
act together,'' Ford told Bush in the photo session.
   Bush told his White House visitor, ``Anything we can do to help,
we want to do it. I want to assure you, the priority is passage of
this legislation.''
   Ford told Bush he had received an ``absolutely wonderful''
response on Capitol Hill.
   Bush's military invasion of Panama resulted in physical
destruction and looting of stores, in addition to economic damage
left by U.S. sanctions against the Noriega regime.
   Nicaragua labored for several years under a U.S. trade embargo
against its leftist government, which poured large parts of its
national resources into fighting the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   The Nicaragua portion of the aid package includes $30 million to
help demobilize and resettle the Contras in their homeland. It also
includes assistance for the incoming government of Violeta Chamorro
to get the nation's agricultural economy back on a sure footing.

Police</HEAD>

   The leader of East Germany's Christian
Democrats formally declared Friday his intention to run for prime
minister following his party's victory in national elections.
   But Lothar de Maiziere continued to be dogged by allegations he
collaborated with the disbanded Communist secret police. He again
denied the accusations when he announced his candidacy at a news
conference.
   De Maiziere, 50, whose Christian Democrats head the three-party
Alliance for Germany, had said Thursday his candidacy for the top
job depended on the outcome of talks between his party and others
on forming a coalition government.
   But West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had been pushing de
Maiziere to declare his intentions and start forming a government
as soon as possible so Bonn and East Berlin can negotiate
unification.
   The Alliance, which also includes Democratic Awakening and the
German Social Union, supports speedy reunification. In East
Germany's first free elections Sunday, it captured the largest
share of seats in the 400-member Parliament but failed to clinch a
majority.
   It was widely expected de Maiziere would seek the prime
minister's post, although other possible candidates have been
mentioned. Parliament must meet within 30 days of the election and
pick a prime minister on a simple majority vote.
   The West German newspaper Cologne Express said Friday that de
Maiziere had a code name, ``Scerny'' in the files of the secret
police, who for years enforced the repressive tactics of the
hard-line Communist regime.
   The newspaper cited as its source Werner Fischer, an official in
charge of dismantling the hated secret police, or ``Stasi.''
Fischer was quoted as saying he got the information from the same
anonymous source who revealed that the former chairman of the
Democratic Awakening party had links to the Stasi.
   The party official, Wolfgang Schnur, resigned as chairman after
admitting he had been involved with the Stasi.
   Fischer conceded he had no proof de Maiziere was a secret police
informer but that he took the allegations seriously.
   The newspaper quoted Fischer as saying it was possible de
Maiziere was the target of a campaign to discredit him.
   In 40 years of Communist rule, the Stasi helped run the country
by controlling many aspects of daily and official life, and many
people had little choice but to collaborate. The caretaker
Communist government began dissolving it after the fall
pro-democracy movement that overthrew the hard-line Communist
regime.
   By official count, about one of every 80 East Germans once
either worked for or cooperated with the secret police. But many
people say even more were involved in helping longtime Communist
leader Erich Honecker keep the 16.3 million people under firm
control. Honecker was ousted Oct. 18.
   In seeking a coalition government, alliance officials said they
were near an agreement with three parties close to West Germany's
Free Democrats, a junior partner in the Bonn government coalition.
Talks were to continue next week, according to Democratic
Awakening's new chairman, Rainer Eppelmann.
   Eppelmann also renewed a coalition offer to the Social
Democrats, who finished second in the balloting Sunday. The Social
Democrats agreed to talks but said they would not cooperate with
the German Social Union, the most right-wing party in the Alliance
for Germany.
   Final official election results published Friday gave the
Alliance for Germany one less seat in Parliament and accorded one
more to the Social Democrats. The alliance now hold 192 seats, and
the Social Democrats 88.

   Singer Billy Joel won the first round of a $90
million lawsuit he filed against his former manager.
   State Judge Edward Lehner ordered the ex-manager, Frank Weber,
to pay the singer $2 million that Joel contended was stolen from
him. Lehner also said Joel was entitled to go to trial on another
set of claims against Weber.
   Joel contends that Weber took $30 million from him in
unauthorized management commissions, investments in companies Weber
controlled and other alleged embezzlements.
   Joel also is seeking $60 million in punitive damages from Weber,
according to Joel's lawyer, Leonard Marks.
   In the written opinion Thursday, Lehner dismissed Weber's claim
that he had an oral agreement to pay $2 million back to Joel.
   Marks said he contacted Joel in London and told the singer of
the judge's decision.
   ``Billy is absolutely delighted with this result and regards it
as a first-round knockout,'' he said.
   Marks said he expected the case to go to trial in six months to
a year.
   Weber's attorney, Anthony Conforti, could not be reached for
comment Friday because he was on vacation, according to a secretary
at his Long Island office.

   Donald Trump had his alleged mistress Marla
Maples move in next door to him at Trump Tower, much to the dismay
of his estranged wife, Ivana, a newspaper reported Friday.
   ``I am shocked and saddened that Donald could subject me and the
children to such shameful behavior,'' Mrs. Trump said, according to
gossip columnist Liz Smith's account in the Daily News.
   Ms. Maples moved into the building in December, Smith said, and
has evaded the past 5{ weeks of intensive media scrutiny by using a
side entrance and taking the service elevator directly to her
63rd-floor apartment.
   After Trump's separation from his wife became public in
February, Trump moved in across the hall from Ms. Maples, Smith
said.
   It was reported Thursday that Trump was ``dropping'' Ms. Maples.
But Smith called this a ruse designed to ``soften up'' Mrs. Trump
and prevent her from making legal moves that might embarrass the
billionaire tycoon before he goes before the New Jersey Casino
Control Commission on Thursday.
   Trump is seeking final license approval for the Taj Mahal, his
mega-casino slated to open April 5 in Atlantic City.
   Trump's spokesman has refused to comment on the alleged affair.
Ms. Maples' spokesman has said the aspiring actress' relationship
with Trump was never more than a friendship.

   Miss America Debbye Turner says she
entered beauty pageants repeatedly and refused to listen to critics
who told her a black woman would never win the national contest.
   She also said she was undeterred when the same critics scoffed
at her for being a devout Christian and a marimba player.
   Ms. Turner, who won the title last September in Atlantic City,
told high school students Thursday that her example should show
everybody that all dreams are attainable.
   She said she entered pageants repeatedly, and had two runner-up
finishes in Arkansas, before winning the Miss Missouri title and
qualifying to go to Atlantic City.
   ``I said, `Alright, God, do you want me to do this?'' Ms. Turner
recalled. ``What's important about the story is, no, I didn't give
up.''
   Ms. Turner said afterward that she has delivered much the same
speech to dozens of school audiences, but that the message of
motivating youth to high achievement has remained fresh.
   ``Although it's the hundredth time, I'm doing something I
sincerely believe in,'' she said.

   The White House broccoli saga continued Friday.
   As the president left to spend a presumably broccoli-free
weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md., the White
House announced that his wife, Barbara, will be on hand to greet 10
tons of the chompy green stuff when it arrives in Washington on
Monday.
   Three cases of the vegetable the president loves to hate will be
delivered to the White House, representing 10 tons being sent by
california growers to Washington soup kitchens.
   Mrs. Bush will join Ed Downes of the United Fresh Fruit and
Vegetable Associations Emergency Services Food Bank in accepting
the vegetables.
   The first lady is fond of broccoli, but the president has put
himself on the record as planning never to eat another stalk. After
all, he told reporters Thursday, he's president of the United
States and he doesn't have to eat it if he doesn't want to.
   His earlier comments about the vegetable provoked broccoli
growers to send truck loads of it to the Washington soup kitchens.

   He mumbles, pulls at his tie, looks uncomfortable
when mobbed by celebrities and knows little about protocol. This,
plus a simple moral message, is what endears Vaclav Havel to a
world weary of made-to-measure politicians.
   When he made his first presidential journey abroad, to East
Germany, his aides had to scramble to get him his passport. It had
been confiscated by the ousted Communist bosses.
   Now, three months after his fairy-tale ascent from prisoner to
president, Havel has visited 10 countries. This week it was France
and Britain. As usual, he was watched with adoration.
   Havel is using his position as a platform to expound on a
political philosophy developed over 20 years of writing.
   His voice is gravelly from years of chain-smoking, he sometimes
mumbles or bumps into the microphone, but his words are clear,
simple and direct: ``Totalitarianism deforms the human soul. People
in Czechoslovakia are constantly asking me about ways to implement
the new freedom. And I tell them, implement it in any way you
wish.''
   He is one of a kind, an artist-stateman and the darling of the
intelligentsia: Kurt Vonnegut, Zubin Mehta, Paul Simon, Edward
Albee in New York; in Paris, an all-star cast led by actor Alain
Delon; Tom Stoppard, Harold Pinter and Jeremy Irons among the
guests at a reception given by the Royal Shakespeare Company in
London.
   ``In the United States we encountered almost embarrassing
adulation,'' said Havel's spokesman Michael Zantovsky. ``They
treated him as if he were some kind of modern prophet, and he is
not particularly eager to become one.''
   Instead he is modest, shy, prone to blush. He deflects attention
with humor and irony. He stands behind tables and against walls,
away from the center of the room. At one point he even managed
somehow to hunch his short frame under a loudspeaker.
   Except for the suit and tie, there is little to distinguish
Havel the harassed dissident from Havel the president.
   ``The reception he gets is something we have been absolutely
unprepared for,'' Zantovsky said. ``It really is too much of a good
thing.''
   At the London reception Thursday night, in his own milieu of
theater and art, Havel looked relaxed.
   With a cut-crystal glass of white wine and a cigarette in one
hand, gesticulating with the other, he chatted with men in
ponytails and earrings and women in men's suits.
   Havel clearly enjoys the drama of his situation and the
theatricality of the presidency. The new uniforms he picked to
replace the drab khaki of communism on the palace honor guard, for
example, were created by the costume designer for Milos Forman's
film, ``Amadeus.''
   But Havel's performance abroad is unrehearsed and improvisation
is not without pitfalls.
   At his Paris news conference he kept tugging at his tie as if it
were a noose around a neck more accustomed to open-necked shirts.
   A British TV commentary described him as ``refreshingly naive.''
After shaking hands with Prince Philip on the stately steps of
Buckingham Palace, he wiped his sweaty palm on his pants,
apparently unaware that the nation would see it on TV.
   But if there were rough edges, they were always softened by
Havel's polished and thoughtful words. Like all the speeches he has
given over the past three months, they were a logical extension of
the limpid essays he has written for 20 years.
   Introducing him to an audience of intellectuals on Wednesday,
political commentator Timothy Garton-Ash called him ``an
exceptional example of what I might call moral leadership through
language.''
   From a moral base built on years of fighting tyranny, Havel
preaches political morality at a time when old political blocs and
policies are crumbling. His watchwords are ``living in truth,''
preserving the sanctity of words, revering freedom.
   He insists he will serve as president only until Czechoslovakia
has free elections, and these are scheduled for June. But already
his impact looks permanent.
   His words, Ash said, have become ``letters to the world.'' Or,
as The Times of London put it: ``Havel is an idea whose man has
come.''

<HEAD>FDA Approves Drug for Children with `Bubble Boy' Syndrome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Friday
approved a drug officials say will dramatically improve the lives
of children born with a rare disease that makes them unable to
fight infections.
   About 40 children worldwide are born each year with severe
combined immunodeficiency disease, or SCID, a genetic disorder also
called ``Boy in the Bubble'' disease because some children have
survived only by living in an enclosed, sterile environment.
   Peg-ADA was developed with a $169,000 grant from the FDA under
the ``orphan'' drug program, which is designed to give companies a
financial incentive to develop products for an extremely small
patient population.
   Children with SCID lack adequate immune systems and therefore
are unable to fight even common infections, such as chicken pox or
pneumonia. Most children with the disorder die before they are 2
years old.
   The only cure for the disease, the cause of which is believed to
be lack of an enzyme, is a bone marrow transplant, generally from a
sibling.
   Peg-ADA, made by Enzon Inc. of South Plainfield, N.J., will
allow children for whom bone marrow transplant is not feasible or
has failed to survive outside a sterile environment.
   Only about 20 percent of the children born with SCID find a
compatible bone-marrow donor and only about 30 percent to 40
percent of those have successful transplants, said Donna Chappina,
a spokeswoman for Enzon.
   ``It will have a dramatic effect on improving the quality of
life for the patients and their families,'' said Dr. James Mason,
assistant secretary for health in the Department of Health and
Human Services.
   Once the drug takes effect, children who had been confined to
sterile isolation would be able to live a normal life, going to
school and interacting with other people, Chappina said.
   The company said the drug is the first treatment for directly
correcting an inherited enzyme deficiency disease.
   The drug is administered weekly by injection. It is designed to
replace the missing enzyme adenosine deaminase, or ADA. Because it
does not prompt the body to produce the enzyme, patients must take
the injections for the rest of their lives.
   The product will be marketed under the trade name Adagen.

   A condominium owner who lost a legal war to
keep his pickup truck in front of his home now parks a make-believe
tank, complete with fake machine gun, outside.
   ``I'm standing up for the rights of condo owners who are afraid
or intimidated,'' Andrew Zuccala, dressed in combat fatigues, said
Thursday about his aesthetic battle.
   Zuccala's fight with his condo association at the Fox Hollow
development began when the anti-truck parking rule was passed two
years after he purchased his condo. The truck he owned then was
permissible under a grandfather provision, but a replacement was
not.
   After warning Zuccala several times that his 1989 blue pickup
was not allowed, the association sued. The Palm Beach County
Circuit Court ruled in its favor Monday.
   Zuccala, 32, responded by painting a 1971 station wagon in
camouflage colors installing black cannon turrets on the roof and
hood, and adorning it with such slogans as ``War Wagon,'' ``Captain
Andrew'' and ``Condo Commando Killer'' on it.
   Unlike his truck, the ``war wagon'' conforms to condo rules,
Zuccala said.
   ``My blue truck isn't offensive, but it's banned,'' he said.
``This tank is all right because it's a car and not a truck. They
have a choice. It's the tank or the truck.''
   Michael Gelfand, the condominium association attorney, has not
seen the mock tank, but said the group does have restrictions on
nuisances and eyesores.

   Remember the Land Shark that gobbled up
characters on ``Saturday Night Live''? Firefighters summoned to a
minor house fire found two sand sharks waiting for them.
   ``They're not dangerous,'' owner Kerry Martinez told Fire Lt.
Howie Carlson. ``They're sand sharks. They're only about 2 feet
long.''
   Firefighters responding to an electrical fire arrived at the
Martinez house in Brooklyn early Thursday to find Martinez, his
wife and three daughters outside.
   Carlson asked if there were any people or animals inside and was
told there were two sharks on the living room rug. The 180-gallon
aquarium holding them had burst, apparently as a result of the fire.
   After putting out the blaze, which started in some electrical
equipment, the firefighters used shovels to lift the fish into
pails of salt water.
   Since the sharks had lost their aquarium, Martinez said he would
donate them to the New York Aquarium at Coney Island.

   Defeating students three times his age
in a statewide art contest wasn't the hard part for 6-year-old
Michael Thaddeaus Bragulla.
   Drawing God's feet was.
   ``They're just like mine,'' said Thad, who lives in Belton,
south of Kansas City. ``Drawing the toes was the hardest part.''
   His poster ``Reflections: Where Does the Sky End?'' was selected
recently over 1,826 entries to represent Missouri in a nationwide
contest sponsored by the PTA. It will hang for the next couple of
months at the PTA's national headquarters in Chicago before being
entered in a national competition in June.
   Thad's poster was done first in pencil and then colored with
magic marker. He started by drawing a tree and added his house, in
which his mother can be seen washing dishes. Then he added himself,
his brother, his father and his dog playing outside.
   He put a bird's nest atop the tree and a rainbow above that. On
up, he added clouds, the moon, Saturn, a spaceship and space
creatures.
   Then angels, and finally, God's feet.
   Thad emphasizes he was only 5 when he drew the poster.
   ``My brain sends messages to my mouth,'' he said. ``When my
mouth says it's good, that's when I know I'm done.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The body of executed journalist Farzad Bazoft was
flown back to London without ceremony on Friday from Baghdad, where
he was convicted and hanged as a spy.
   The Iranian-born Bazoft, 31, who lived in London, worked for The
Observer weekly, which has said he was not a spy and was simply
doing his job.
   A scheduled Iraqi Airways Boeing 747 landed at Heathrow airport
with the plain plywood coffin on which Bazoft's surname and the
address of a south London undertaker were written with a green
felt-tip pen.
   Bazoft was hanged March 15 despite British-led international
appeals to President Saddam Hussein for clemency.
   Mailbags and suitcases belonging to passengers were with the
coffin in the cargo hold.
   The coffin was unloaded on a mechanical ramp. Three British
Airways cargo handlers put the coffin in a van, which drove it to a
cargo shed to await collection for burial.
   ``There was no official from the Foreign Office, no hearse and
no relative or friend on the tarmac,'' reported Britain's domestic
Press Association news agency.
   The Foreign Office said The Observer had paid for the body's
return and was arranging the funeral because Bazoft had no
relatives in Britain.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd recalled Britain's ambassador in
protest and was sending home six Iraqi military trainees.
   Bazoft was on his seventh visit to Iraq in September in a group
of journalists invited to cover elections in Kurdistan. He was
arrested trying to check out reports of an explosion at a military
installation, where the Iraqis said he made drawings, took
photographs and collected soil samples.
   Daphne Parish, 52, a British nurse working in Baghdad who drove
Bazoft to the secret military site, was jailed for 15 years for
helping him.
   A memorial service for Bazoft is being held at the journalists'
church, St. Bride's on Fleet Street, on March 28.

   The nation's wool production declined slightly
last year after increasing in 1988, the Agriculture Department said
Friday.
   Production was estimated at 89.2 million pounds, down from 89.5
million in 1988, an annual report said. Wool output in 1987 was
less than 84.5 million pounds.
   The report said the total value of wool shorn in 1989 was about
$109 million, down from $125 million in 1988.
   Mohair production was reported at 17.3 million pounds, about the
same as in 1988. The value was put at $27.2 million, down from
$32.8 million the year before.
   The report said prices of shorn wool in 1989 averaged $1.22 per
pound, compared with $1.38 in 1988. Mohair prices, at $1.58 per
pound, were down from $1.89 in 1988.

<HEAD>Sewer Workers Discover Remains of Cheops' Long-Lost Temple</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NAZLETT EL-SAMMAN, Egypt (AP) _ Sewer workers have discovered
remains of a temple that Pharaoh Cheops built for his funeral 4,600
years ago, and Egyptologists are hoping it will tell them more
about the mysterious pharaoh of the Great Pyramid.
   The discovery this month of Cheop's Valley Temple confirms
theories about the layout of Giza Plateau for the 70-year period in
which the pharaoh, his son and grandson built their three pyramids
and monuments nearby.
   Nazlett el-Samman lies at the foot of the plateau, facing the
Sphinx, and sewage from the village often is mentioned as a cause
of the Sphinx's dangerous deterioration. A U.S.-financed sewage
project began last year, and Egyptologists were assigned to monitor
construction because of the probability of finding antiquities.
   They were on hand in early March as diggers began uncovering
mammoth granite and limestone blocks, a flint knife, Roman brick
walls and other relics.
   By mid-March, more remains were turning up, and finally the main
prize _ a 59-foot-long row of basalt rocks. The experts identified
it as the floor for Cheops' Valley Temple.
   Because basalt is difficult to carve and expensive, the stone
was reserved for royal use, often as flooring for sacred places.
   Although his pyramid was the largest ever built, Cheops left few
other glimpses of his life or his 23-year reign, which ended in
2528 B.C.
   ``With what we're finding now, we can piece together Cheops'
history and reconstruct how this part of the pyramids area would
have looked,'' said Zahi Hawass of the Egyptian Antiquities
Organization.
   The newly found ruins lie 13 feet below street level, partially
covered with sewage.
   Getting to them will not be easy. Diggers already are excavating
two Roman-era sites in a Nazlett el-Samman alley only a foot from
village houses. Archaeologists have to contend with children at
play, donkeys and angry villagers worried that antiquities
officials might invoke their legal authority to force them from
their houses.
   Cheops' Valley Temple is proving an even greater challenge.
Engineers for the sewer project are pumping water from the drainage
ditch where the basalt flooring was found.
   The Giza Pyramids and the structures around them are thought by
some Egyptologists to be part of an elaborate blueprint for the
dead, precisely planned and executed. But their exact roles in the
death and resurrection of the pharaohs are debated.
   Burial was an elaborate ritual to ensure that neither the
pharaoh nor Egypt would ever die.
   The journey to eternity began in the Valley Temple, where the
pharaoh's body was taken for ritual purification, perhaps
embalming. For the final rituals, the body was carried up the long
causeway to a mortuary temple next to the pyramid.
   Early travelers' descriptions of the pyramids area had given
modern egyptogists a good idea where Cheops' temple should be found.
   In the fifth century B.C., the Greek Herodotus wrote that he saw
Cheops' causeway, covered and decorated with carved animal scenes.
The German scholar Karl Richard Lepsius said only traces remained
of the ruined causeway by the early 1840s.

<HEAD>Bush Out Of Step On Broccoli</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is out of the mainstream when
it comes to broccoli. People love broccoli, and government
statistics prove it.
   ``We called it the vegetable of the 80s,'' said Agriculture
Department economist Gary Lucier.
   He said broccoli consumption more than doubled in the United
States between 1980 and 1988, going from an annual average of 3
pounds per person to 6.8 pounds.
   Back in 1970, Americans on average were eating only 1{ pounds of
the vegetable each year.
   Both fresh and frozen versions move quickly off the supermarket
shelves, though most people prefer it fresh, according to
statistics.
   Lucier said health concerns played a major role in the big jump.
   Broccoli is high in vitamin C and has a substantial amount of
vitamin A, says a pamphlet from the United Fresh Fruit and
Vegetable Association.
   Bush's distaste for the food was revealed last week when he
banned it from Air Force One's galley. It made headlines when he
told questioning reporters on Thursday:
   ``I do not like broccoli and I haven't liked it since I was a
little kid and my mother made me eat it and I'm president of the
United States and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli.''
   Bush, 65, clearly was one of the early eaters of broccoli.
   Though the vegetable was discovered thousands of years ago,
California farmers began growing it experimentally for the U.S.
market in the 1920s, shipping just a few crates East.
   It's so perishable that it requires the quick transport of
modern times to make it to stores any distance from the fields in
edible condition.
   The USDA didn't even keep records of acreage planted in broccoli
until 1946 when about 18,700 acres were planted to the crop
nationwide. By 1989, the acreage had jumped to 121,500. The amount
of broccoli that could be grown on each acre more than doubled in
those 45 years.
   California fills 90 percent of the country's demand for the
plant, but it's also a significant cash crop for Arizona, Texas and
Oregon and is produced in smaller quantities in other states.
   Maine, for example, where Bush has been vacationing most of his
life, is the biggest supplier in New England.
   ``We've gone from zero to about 3,000 acres over the past six or
seven years,'' said Russell Libby, director of the Maine Department
of Agriculture.
   Maine broccoli farmer Lance Smith said it was too bad the
president didn't like broccoli, but he was was entitled to his own
opinion.
   ``But you know, he really hasn't looked good,'' said Smith.
``We've noticed he's looked a little peaked. That could be it.''

<HEAD>New York Investment Banker Becomes Chairman of Kennedy Center</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A New York investment banker who heads
Carnegie Hall was named Friday as the new chairman of the Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts, and he promised to make it a
pre-eminent international institution.
   ``We are at the starting line of a new effort to place the
Kennedy Center in its rightful place as one of the major performing
arts institutions in the world,'' James D. Wolfensohn said after
being appointed by a unanimous vote by the board of trustees.
``That opportunity exists.''
   Wolfensohn, 56, was born in Australia and is now an American
citizen. He was an executive partner of Salomon Brothers in New
York and an executive at several other banking and finance firms
before starting his own, James D. Wolfensohn Inc.
   A cellist and one-time Olympic fencer, Wolfensohn is involved in
extensive public interest and volunteer efforts. He is a director
of CBS Inc. in addition to being chairman of Carnegie Hall.
   Wolfensohn said Friday he will remain chairman of Carnegie Hall
at least through the 1990-91 season, the hall's centennial. He said
he will be in Washington for at least two full days a week and
probably more than that in the first three to six months.
   He agreed to take the job after the Bush administration and key
congressmen pledged Friday to help eradicate the center's $15
million deficit and to subsidize a backlog of repairs and
maintenance.
   Trustee Melvin Laird said six lawmakers on the center's board
agreed to introduce bills providing money to take care of the
deficit as well as an additional $30 million over two years for
roof and garage repairs and other capital improvements.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu gave assurances that the
administration will support the requests, Laird said.
   ``It is on that condition that I have come down,'' Wolfensohn
said, referring to the financial help. ``And if it didn't
materialize, we'd have to look at everyone's position, including
mine.''
   The new chairman said he will appoint a president to manage the
Kennedy Center's daily operations and an artistic director to shape
its programming. He said the center needs to raise another $20
million to $25 million a year from private sources to bring its
programs and management up to world-class standards.
   ``Excitement unfortunately comes very expensive today,'' he
said. ``And to make this place exciting we're going to need a lot
of money.''
   Wolfensohn called the Kennedy Center ``the cultural heartbeat of
this country'' and an international showplace. But he stressed that
it is a local institution as well.
   ``We're committed to warm it up, make it accessible, have it
loved, cherished and visited by the people of Washington,'' he said.
   Kennedy Center officials had been searching for a new chairman
since last Oct. 25, when chairman and president Ralph P. Davidson
submitted his resignation. Wolfensohn's appointment was effective
immediately.

<TEXT>
   Flattened cars and a stainless steel autopsy
table fringed with human hair greeted visitors at Friday's opening
of an American contemporary sculpture exhibition.
   ``Status of Sculpture,'' at the Espace Lyonnais d'Art
Contemporain through May 20, looks at what 10 young American
sculptors are doing with objects from everyday life.
   Take Jon Kessler's ``Twin Kings,'' an automated collage of
cobblestones from a Paris street, two heads of French kings bought
at a museum gift shop, two panes of stained glass, spotlights and a
blinking bulb.
   ``These are objects from my life in Paris, and a commentary on
art itself,'' said Kessler, a native of Yonkers, N.Y.
   For California sculptor Dustin Shuler, whose ``car pelts''
delighted the Lyon audience, the automobile symbolizes life in 20th
century America.
   ``Ever seen the cars on the California freeways? They're herds,
migrating,'' said Shuler. ``Cars have replaced buffalos _ I hunt
them, skin them and hang them on the wall.''
   Currently adorning the outside wall of the Perrache railroad
station in Lyon is one of Shuler's most prized ``kills'' _ a
flattened Los Angeles Police Department squad car.
   ``That was a 1978 Plymouth with a hot engine, an endangered
species being phased out of service. I still had to get
authorization from the Los Angeles City Council to buy the car,''
he said.
   Shuler, 41, a native of Pittsburgh, said his works are priced at
$20,000 and up, depending on the condition and rarity of the car.
   Also on display are ``juvenile pelts'' made from skinned kiddie
cars, and a red Ford pickup truck with its original Texas license
plates.
   ``This is Texas personified,'' he said.
   Shuler says he looks for cars with a unique character and favors
Volkswagens because of their resemblance to animals.
   ``Look at that VW bus, to me that's a pair of elephant ears,''
he said.
   The Lyon show will travel to the Institute of Contemporary Art
in London next fall and the Kunstmuseum in Hasselt, Belgium next
winter. It also features works by Tishan Hsu, Jennifer Bolande,
Christian Marclay, Robert Gober, Cady Noland and Laurie Parsons.
   Organized by Bernard Brunon, an artist and curator based in
Houston, the show is an attempt to underscore the ``poetry'' of the
banal consumer objects taken for granted.
   ``Look at the teapot balanced precariously on a cube,'' Brunon
said, referring to a composition by New York artist Nancy Shaver.
``It's talking to the pitcher of milk and through the blue glass in
the middle.''
   Some visitors at the spacious art center _ on the fourth floor
of the train station _ weren't sure they were looking at art. An
autopsy table fringed with human hair by Phoenix, Ariz., artist
Patty Martori raised more than one eyebrow.
   ``I don't know what it is, but why not, if it's fun,'' said a
Lyon gendarme with a shrug.

<TEXT>
   Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki
reported some progress Thursday in winning President Bush's support
for international guarantees of Poland's border with Germany.
   Mazowiecki, discussing separate tensions across Poland's eastern
border, also urged Kremlin leaders to avoid any rash actions
against the breakaway Soviet republic of Lithuania.
   During a three-day visit to Washington, Mazowiecki did not win a
firm public pledge from Bush that Poland would play a greater role
in talks expected to lead to the reununification of Germany later
this year, but Bush did agree that Poland's voice should be heard
when issues vital to Poland are on the table.
   Mazowiecki told reporters at the National Press Club that his
delegation had ``achieved a greater understanding of our position''
among U.S. leaders.
   And he said Bush had assured him that the United States
recognized Poland as a major player in the transformation of Europe.
   Many elements of that transformation remain murky at the moment,
including whether West and East Germany will guarantee the German
border with Poland. One third of Poland's territory consists of
lands that were German before World War II.
   At the close of the war, the Soviet Union annexed the western
third of Poland, and Poland received German territory in return.
   Mazowiecki refrained from instructing the leaders of Lithuania
and the Soviet Union how to resolve their differences, but offered
them three bits of counsel.
   ``First talk. Second, talk. And third, talk,'' said Mazowiecki.
   Neither the Polish nor the U.S. government has recognized the
independent government of Lithuania, although the United States
never recognized the forced Soviet annexation of Lithuania and its
sister Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia during World War II.
   Another murky subject in the transformation of Europe is the
role of the Kremlin-led Warsaw Pact and the continuing presence of
Soviet troops on the territory of pact members like Poland.
   Bush, after meeting with Mazowiecki, said Thursday that he had
not obtained from the Polish prime minister a clear picture of when
the estimated 58,000 Soviet troops stationed in Poland would leave.
   Mazowiecki told the news conference Friday that he expected
Soviet troops to be withdrawn from Poland as part of multilateral
negotiations on conventional force reductions throughout Europe.
   He declined to establish a direct link between Poland's
aquiescence to the continued presence of Soviet troops on its
territory and German guarantees of Poland's western border.
   But he said that ``it is crucial for us to have our our border
reaffirmed by a treaty initialled by the two Germanies before
reunification (of Germany) takes place.''
   ``By defending our Western border, we are defending the
inviolability of all borders'' in Europe, he said.
   In a separate speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Mazowiecki
urged the United States to maintain its political presence in
Europe, and to invest in Poland as a means of opening markets in
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   ``We have a rich record of working in the Russian market, in
building railroads, for example,'' he told the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce. ``We could renew that and carry the world of free
enterprise into that market.''

   An Israeli army jeep accidentally hit and
killed a 5-year-old girl Friday in a refugee camp in the occupied
Gaza Strip, touching off a clash between soldiers and residents
enraged by the death, Arab reports said. A 20-year-old was reported
wounded in the unrest.
   The girl, Wafa Nabil Abdul Razit Abu Midin, jumped into the
street and was accidentally struck by the jeep, police said. She
was brought to a hospital but died shortly afterward, said Yigal
Golan, a spokesman for the Gaza District police.
   Arab reports said news of the death prompted a riot in the
Bureij camp. They said the 20-year-old was shot in the leg when
troops opened fire on the crowd.
   The army said it had no reports of unrest but was checking the
report.
   Also Friday, two firebombs were thrown in the occupied West Bank
town of Ramallah, the army said.
   Israel radio reported that the firebombs hit a car transporting
television crews from the U.S. network ABC and Visnews of Britain,
but there was no damage or injuries.

<TEXT>
   As a military band played ``The Ballad of the
Green Berets,'' the Army conducted a group burial Friday of remains
thought to belong to seven Army soldiers and two Vietnamese pilots
shot down over Laos in 1968.
   The burial, which took place at Arlington National Cemetery, had
touched off complaints from some POW@MIA representatives, given
that only one of the nine individuals had been positively
identified from the bone shards and teeth recovered last year from
the crash site.
   But Army officials said they were able to account for those
aboard the CH-34 helicopter that was shot down by anti-aircraft
fire over Laos in 1968 because of other evidence recovered at the
site and eyewitness accounts of the event.
   Although group burials are not commonplace, they are used when
individual bodies can't be accounted for from the forensic evidence
available, said Army spokeswoman Maj. Nancy Burt.
   ``It went very well. Either family members or representatives of
the (U.S. soldiers') families were there to accept the flags,''
said another spokeswoman, Shari Lawrence, of the U.S. Total Army
Personnel Command.
   ``The families need to have this time of emotion and grief,''
said Ms. Lawrence, who attended the ceremony.
   The remains of the one crew member who was identified, Staff
Sgt. Richard A. Fitts, of Abingdon, Mass., were buried in his
hometown earlier this year. However, his name is also listed with
the other six Green Berets on the group's grave marker, given the
possibility that some of his other remains might be mixed with
those buried on Friday, Ms. Lawrence said.
   She said all of the families of the late servicemen agreed to
have their relatives' names put on the group marker.
   However, the names of the two Vietnamese were not included
because the names ``weren't released to us,'' she said.
   Ms. Lawrence said she did not know why that was, but that such a
situation might occur if the families couldn't be located.
   Ms. Lawrence said the Army is scheduled to conduct two more
group burials next month, one for soldiers from the Vietnam War and
another for remains from World War II.
   Besides Fitts, the group interment included: Sgt. 1st Class
Arthur C. Rader, Jr., Atlantic City, N.J.; Sgt. 1st Class Gary R.
LaBohn, Wixom, Mich.; Sgt. 1st Class Michael H. Mein, Cape Vincent,
N.Y.; Sgt. 1st Class Klaus D. Scholz, Amarillo, Texas; Capt. Rayond
C. Stacks, Memphis, Tenn.; Maj. Samuel K. Toomey III, Independence,
Mo.

   Detroit Free Press columnist Jim
Neubacher, who became an advocate for the rights of disabled people
after developing multiple sclerosis, died Thursday at age 40.
   Neubacher died at Providence Hospital, where he was taken March
16 after lapsing into a coma at his parents' home in West
Bloomfield Township.
   ``He was an outstanding journalist,'' Gov. James Blanchard said
Thursday. ``Through his column he brought strength, understanding
and assistance to his readers.''
   Neubacher joined the Free Press in 1971 after graduating from
the University of Michigan. He worked as a city desk reporter and
as the Free Press' first Canada correspondent and columnist.
   Neubacher's multiple sclerosis was diagnosed in 1980 when he was
29. In 1982, he returned to Detroit and started his weekly column,
``Disabled in Detroit.''
   Through the column, Neubacher became a leader for disabled
activists across the state.
   In 1988, Blanchard presented Neubacher with Michigan's first
Victory Award.
   Survivors include his parents, James and Margaret Neubacher, a
brother and three sisters. Services were scheduled for Saturday.

<HEAD>Israelis Fed Up With Backroom Deals in Race for Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From shopkeepers to the president, Israelis are
expressing growing anger over the latest and most entangled round
of backroom deals by politicians struggling to form the next
government.
   ``The Israeli political system has reached its lowest point,''
liberal legislator Amnon Rubinstein said Friday. ``What we are
dealing with is not a political process, but a process of political
bribery.''
   The political horsetrading is a product of Israel's electoral
system, which encourages tiny parties. That's because the whole
country is a single electoral district, and the cutoff point for
gaining a seat is less than 1 percent of the votes cast. This has
meant no party has ever gained enough votes to govern alone,
leading to coalitions with an array of small factions.
   The two largest groups, the center-left Labor Party and the
right-wing Likud Bloc, have promised for years to push electoral
reform, such as direct voting for the prime minister. But reform
bills have always been quietly buried in Parliament committees.
   Avi Pazner, a chief aide to caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir of Likud, now says the two big parties should have tried
harder to reform the system the past five years, when they governed
together in a coalition.
   ``Both parties were suspicious of one another. Both somehow were
afraid that the other one might utilize the changes, and that's why
they neutralized each other,'' said Pazner.
   ``It was a great mistake. We should have pushed forward an
electoral system that would put some order in our political life.
This is not a desirable system,'' he told The Associated Press.
   The latest chapter in topsy-turvy Israeli politics opened last
week when Labor brought down the Likud-led government with a
no-confidence motion in Parliament over Shamir's refusal to accept
U.S. Middle East peace proposal.
   President Chaim Herzog, who asked Labor leader Shimon Peres to
try to form a new coalition, issued a warning to all parties this
week that Israelis were growing furious with the seemingly endless
political maneuvering.
   Herzog was quoted as saying ``the Israeli public is fed up with
the politicians'' and that ``widespread disillusionment could pave
the way for a demagogue to rise to power.''
   But Herzog's warning was quickly forgotten in the rush by Labor
and Likud to break the deadlock. Each side claims the backing of 60
legislators in the 120-member Parliament.
   The main partners in the game of political seduction are three
ultra-Orthodox religious parties that together control 13 seats.
They have been offered key Cabinet posts and funding for religious
institutions in exchange for their support.
   For example, the small Agudat Israel party joined the Labor camp
after reportedly being promised the ministries of housing, labor
and social affairs.
   Agudat legislator Rabbi Menachem Porush said Likud upped the
ante by dangling the valuable Finance Ministry in front of Agudat
if it switched affiliations.
   Many Israelis are angered by the latest wheeling and dealing.
   ``This is a terrible situation. It's like blackmail, '' said Dan
Ben Moshe, 30, who runs a Jerusalem cigarette shop. ``Everybody
wants something in exchange for their support, mainly (government)
jobs.''
   The conservative Maariv daily was even more scathing in an
editorial Friday: ``Of all the democratic systems in the world,
Israel has succeeded in finding the worst. The politicians have no
shame. They use the weaknesses of the government to their
advantage.''

   The U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the
private Nature Conservancy signed a historic agreement Friday to
combine their efforts to preserve wildlife and its habitat for
future generations.
   The agreement formalizes a public-private national partnership
to save endangered and rare animals and plants on 40 percent of the
country's public lands, encompassing 270 million acres. The BLM's
domain includes one-eighth of the land mass in the continental
United States, with more than 3,000 species of fish and wildlife,
1,000 of which are considered imperiled.
   ``This is a policy statement down to our local folks that the
green light's lit'' for a trend-setting relationship, said BLM
director Cy Jamison.
   The non-profit Nature Conservancy is committed to preserving
biology, zoology and natural ecosystems.
   Started 36 years ago, it has more than 500,000 members in
chapters across the country, a $100 million annual budget and
employs biologists, lawyers and people with business degrees. Its
goal is the acquisition of private lands to keep as wilderness
preserves.
   That can mean ownership or leasing, alone or in concert with
governmental agencies such as the BLM, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service or state parks departments.
   ``What we're really trying to do is to protect our natural
heritage,'' said John Sawhill, the conservancy's new president and
former federal energy chief.
   ``The rate of species extinction in this country is increasing
dramatically, and we're trying to slow that down. We're trying to
preserve species and important natural communities for future
generations.''
   The Nature Conservancy has acquired more than 5 million acres as
nature preserves in the United States and more in Latin America. It
maintains a hefty national revolving fund for its state
conservancies to tap into for acquisitions such as the Kartchner
Caverns in southeastern Arizona.
   In all, it owns and manages more than 900 nature preserves, the
world's largest privately owned system.
   Jamison said he has no qualms, and sees no conflicts, about a
private organization helping set government policy on land
acquisition, ``as long as it comes from the ground up.''
   He added that in an emergency, the Nature Conservancy can act
much more quickly than the federal government, which can take one
to three years. ``They can move today, and that's why the
partnership is so important,'' Jamison said.

<TEXT>
   Gerald Ford golfs and George Bush
jogs, but long before those chief executives exercised, Calvin
Coolidge took his daily constitutional on an electric horse.
   The machine, a genteel relative of the bucking broncos of
western honky-tonks, is a popular relic of presidential whimsy,
said Kerry Buckley, director of the Coolidge collection at the
Forbes Library.
   The device was shipped this week from the Northampton library
for temporary display in Kansas.
   ``That seems to be the item that's attracted people's
attention,'' Buckley said Friday. ``Mostly we have manuscripts,
documents, letters and so forth.''
   Coolidge, the nation's 30th president and one of its most
conservative, got his political start as Northampton's mayor. He
was a state legislator, lieutenant governor, governor, vice
president and president on the death of Warren Harding in 1923.
   ``Silent Cal'' took up the mechanical horse after developing an
allergy to horsehair and finding that too many newspaper reporters
tagged along on his daily walks. ``He was a man who had firm
habits,'' Buckley said.
   The machine features an English saddle, handgrips and can be
adjusted from a sedate gait to an adventurous gallop.
   Buckley said a 1925 New York Times article described the regimen
this way: ``He takes his first ride before breakfast, indulges in a
brief canter just after luncheon, and by the shade of the moon an
hour or so before retiring for the night, he takes a sharp gallop
that brings on the weariness that induces slumber.''
   While popular on ocean liners, the mechanical horse was hardly
the stationary bicycle of its time and was something of an
anachronism in the Jazz Age, Buckley said.
   ``He represented to the population a president from another era,
an era where we had a nation of producers,'' he said.
   Coolidge, the first president to speak on the radio, earned the
nickname ``Silent Cal,'' because of his general reticence.
   His ambiguous refusal to enter the 1928 election is commemorated
in Northampton annually with the ``I do not choose to run'' 10
kilometer footrace.
   Coolidge retired to Northampton with his wife, Grace. He died in
1933.
   Since then, Northampton has become a laid-back, liberal college
town, but Coolidge's legacy has been preserved at the museum, said
Buckley, visiting assistant professor at the University of
Massachusetts history department.
   The mechanical horse was shipped out this week to the Dwight D.
Eisenhower Library in Abilene, Kan., the fourth time it has been
loaned out by the Forbes. It will be returned in December.
   ``We'll be glad to get it back,'' said Buckley, who views the
cast-iron machine as an allegory for Coolidge's reign as a
Massachusetts Yankee in the Great Gatsby era.
   ``This is a mechanical horse,'' Buckley said. ``What could be
more symbolic of a horse and buggy society being kind of
transformed electronically in the '20s?''

   Two women were sentenced Friday to 40
years in prison for lining up their children so men could pick them
for sex. They received the same sentence last week for forcing two
children to have sex.
   Carolyn Wilson and Annette Sanford each were sentenced in
Allegan County Circuit Court to 5 to 15 years for third-degree
criminal sexual conduct; Wilson got 20 to 40 years and Sanford 10
to 40 years for first-degree criminal sexual conduct.
   The victims had mixed feelings about their mothers going to
prison, said their foster mothers on Friday.
   ``No matter what happened, she's still their mom,'' said Deb
Johnson, who is caring for three of the children. ``I think they do
miss their mother, ... even though they feel terrible about what
was done to them.''
   Dixie Lumbard, a foster mother to one of Sanford's three
daughters, said the children are relieved but echoed Johnson's
sentiments. ``No matter what happened, they're still their
mothers,'' she said.
   The convictions came from the sexual abuse of Wilson's
now-13-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter, who testified their
mother and Sanford forced them, their older sister and Sanford's
young daughters to line up several times a week so visiting men
could select one for sex.
   Authorities believe drugs or money changed hands.
   The children said hundreds of rapes and molestations occurred
from 1985-88, while the two families lived together in Plainwell.
   ``You have violated society's trust and respect of these
children in the most heinous way I can conceive of,'' Judge George
Corsiglia told Wilson during sentencing.
   The women were sentenced last week to up to 40 years for
previous convictions of first-degree criminal sexual conduct for
forcing Wilson's son and Sanford's daughter, then 11 and 9,
respectively, to have sex while the women watched.
   Authorities say Wilson, 42, and Sanford, 34, are half-sisters
and had a lesbian relationship.
   With the sentences being served concurrently and credit given
for time served in the county jail, Wilson could be eligible for
parole in about 15 years and Sanford could be eligible in about 14
years.
   The children, ages 9 to 19, told of being beaten by their
mothers, and a social worker testified they ate from garbage cans
because they were not given food.
   The women have said they are innocent and will appeal the
convictions. Their attorneys argued the children concocted the
sexual abuse stories so they could stay with foster families after
being removed in 1988 from an admittedly neglectful home.

<HEAD>Senate Resolution Says Jerusalem Should be Israeli Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has approved a resolution saying
that an undivided Jerusalem should remain the capital of Israel.
   The Arab League on Friday denounced the resolution, which was
viewed as a criticism of President Bush for saying that Jews should
not settle in East Jerusalem.
   ``This irresponsible resolution forfeits any serious or
constructive role the U.S. Senate can play in the search for a just
peace in the Middle East,'' said Arab League Ambassador Clovis
Maksoud, who represents the 22-member organization.
   The Senate measure, adopted on a unanimous voice vote late
Thursday, has no legal status and simply expresses the sense of the
Senate. It said senators acknowledge ``that Jerusalem is and should
remain the capital of the state of Israel.''
   Jerusalem is revered by the Arab world as one of Islam's holiest
sites and the rightful capital of a Palestinian state. East
Jerusalem is the section of the city seized by Israel in the 1967
Mideast war.
   Maksoud called the resolution a ``shocking development that
demonstrates an incomprehensible and reckless defiance of the
international community, the Arab and Moslem worlds and the
declared policy of the United States.''
   The United States and most other countries have not recognized
Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, maintaining their embassies in
Tel Aviv.
   U.S. policy states that while Jerusalem should not be divided
again, as it was until 1967, the question of sovereignty over the
holy city should be determined in Israeli-Arab negotiations.
   The Senate ``strongly believes that Jerusalem must remain an
undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic religious groups
are protected,'' the Senate measure states.
   Sen. Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said the resolution ``represents
a clear statement by the Senate that President Bush's statements on
East Jerusalem were unwise and untimely.''
   He said Bush's ``ambiguous statements about the status of
Jerusalem'' are not helpful to the peace process.
   Responding to criticism, Bush has argued that he was merely
stating existing policy when he made his remarks earlier this month.
   ``Our efforts in the peace process are in no way designed to
promote the division of Jerusalem,'' Bush said in a letter to Sen.
Rudy Boschwitz, D-Minn.
   Nonetheless, analysts have suggested that his comments about the
sensitive issue of Jerusalem derailed attempts to bring Israel and
the Palestinians to the negotiating table, at a crucial point in
the process.
   Outrage in Israel over Bush's comments eventually led to last
week's fall of the government led by right-wing Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir.

   A CIA employee testified Friday that John
Poindexter left out important facts but didn't appear to be coveing
up when he briefed Congress about a 1985 missile shipment to Iran.
   Testifying as a defense witness at Poindexter's trial, Norman
Gardner described how Sen. David Durenberger ``charged right into''
Poindexter's office on Nov. 21, 1986, to be briefed about the
Reagan administration's Iran initiative.
   Durenberger told Poindexter, ``John, if you're not going to give
us all the facts, we're going to get the hell out of here,'' said
Gardner who was at the meeting taking notes. At the time,
Durenberger was vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
   ``To the best of your knowledge, was Admiral Poindexter
involved'' in obstructing or lying to Congress about the missile
shipment? defense attorney Joseph Small asked Gardner.
   ``No,'' replied Gardner.
   Poindexter is accused of covering up the U.S. role in the
shipment of Hawk missiles by telling the Senate Intelligence
Committee he didn't find out about it until January 1986.
   Poindexter told the House Intelligence Committee in a separate
meeting on Nov. 21, 1986, that then-President Reagan did not
approve the shipment.
   But Gardner knew a presidential document, called a finding, had
been prepared that ratified the CIA-assisted shipment. And
prosecutor Christian Mixter asked why Gardner didn't speak out at
the meeting.
   The finding ``was not done before the shipment,'' but rather was
drafted a day or so after it occurred, retorted Gardner.
   Hours after meeting with the senators and House members,
Poindexter tore up the politically embarrassing document, which
depicted U.S. arms sales to Iran as an arms-for-hostages deal _ a
contradiction of what Reagan was saying publicly.
   Poindexter told the House committee the U.S. government may have
had prior knowledge about the shipment.
   But prosecutor Mixter said as the Poindexter jury listened that
there was ``not just knowledge, there was involvement'' by
Poindexter.
   Gardner has told the FBI that he reviewed CIA cable traffic
which said ``this operation is being conducted under instructions
from Admiral Poindexter,'' said Mixter.
   ``I don't recall'' making those statements to the FBI, replied
Gardner, who at one point called an FBI interview report about him
``totally inaccurate.''
   The same day Poindexter briefed the congressmen, then-CIA
Director William Casey testified on Capitol Hill that the CIA had
been asked to assist a shipment of ``bulky cargo'' in November
1985. Casey gave no indication the CIA knew the cargo was weapons.
Gardner reported Casey's testimony back to Poindexter.
   ``Did you tell Admiral Poindexter that the cover story wasn't
holding up very well?'' Mixter asked Gardner.
   ``No, I didn't,'' Gardner responded. The CIA employee denied
there was any cover story, saying there was ``a great deal of
confusion'' when the CIA found out Hawk missiles were aboard the
plane heading for Iran. A CIA proprietary airline moved the
missiles from Israel to Iran.
   The National Security Agency's deputy director for plans and
policy, Ralph W. Adams, also testified Friday.
   Congress had intelligence from the agency in November 1985
suggesting the U.S. government might be directing the Contras in
Nicaragua, defense attorney Richard Beckler disclosed during Adams'
testimony.
   Beckler's point was that at least a House Intelligence Committee
staff member, Richard Giza, had extensive information about the
Reagan administration's activities in Central America in 1985,
during a congressional ban on U.S. military aid to the rebels.
   Poindexter is accused of concealing from Congress Oliver North's
secret military assistance to the Contras.

   Democrats launched a boisterous attack Friday
on President Bush's tax and foreign policies as they tried to
present a united front from competing conferences 750 miles apart.
   In New Orleans, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas told the Democratic
Leadership Council that Bush's no-new-taxes pledge was ``pure
bushlips,'' accusing him of pushing ``crypto-taxes'' disguised as
user fees and surcharges.
   ``How in the world do you read somebody's lips when they keep
talking out of both sides of their mouth,'' Party Chairman Ronald
H. Brown asked, sounding the same theme.
   He tried to downplay Bush's high ratings in the public opinion
polls.
   ``It's time for us to point out that the Bush Administration has
been getting a free ride _ that we hear a lot of sweet jargon but
we don't see any action,'' he said.
   Brown was shuttling between New Orleans and Indianapolis, where
the Democratic National Committee gathered for its spring meeting.
In Indianapolis, he reminded party leaders about their electoral
successes last year.
   ``I don't remember a single year in my lifetime where one party
has been so dominant as we were in 1989,'' Brown said. He cited
Democratic victories in the year's two gubernatorial races and in
capturing the New Jersey state senate and winning six of the eight
special elections for U.S. House seats.
   Brown also pledged that the party would become more aggressive
in its opposition to Republicans from the White House on down the
ticket.
   ``We're going to be fair, we're going to be accurate, but we're
going to be tough,'' he said.
   Party leaders also criticized Bush for what they characterized
as a timid foreign policy. Bentsen accused Bush of paying too much
attention to public opinion polls and reacting too slowly to events
in Central America, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   ``Can you imagine Harry Truman hesitating to unveil the Truman
Doctrine or the Marshall Plan or the Berlin airlift because of a
public opinion poll?'' he said. ``Can you imagine John Kennedy
doing a poll before dealing with the Cuban Missile Crisis?''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., echoed the criticism, saying ``precisely
as our principles and values are prevailing throughout the world,
America's trumpet is sounding an uncertain note.''
   Bentsen and Brown parted company over a proposal by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to cut the Social Security payroll tax.
   The DNC's executive committee endorsed the Moynihan proposal
Friday and the full committee was certain to follow up when it
meets on Saturday and make it party policy.
   ``This is the right thing to do and the right time to do it,''
said John Marino, New York Democratic Party chairman. ``We have to
say to middle class Americans that we care about you.''
   Brown said he was encountering strong support for the Moynihan
plan wherever he travels.
   But Bentsen, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said he
opposes the plan because it would mean the loss of $50 billion in
revenue.
   ``My concern is that I don't want to see us get into a bidding
war with the Republicans,'' Bentsen said. ``We can't win that one
because they don't care how far they go insofar as increasing that
deficit by cutting of taxes.''
   Brown denied that his difference with Bentsen was a sign of an
unbreachable division within the party, whose more conservative
wing is represented by those in New Orleans.
   ``Just because we don't have every `i' dotted and every `t'
crossed doesn't mean we are not unified,'' Brown said. ``We're
having an open and honest discussion about very complicated
matters.''
   Party officials in Indianapolis also moved a step closer to
adopting the final rules for selecting delegates to the 1992
Democratic National Convention.
   Endorsed was a proposal to permit states to hold primaries or
caucuses starting the first Tuesday in March and ending the second
Tuesday in June. The starting date would be one week earlier than
it was in 1988.
   Also backed was a plan to strip states of up to 25 percent of
their delegates if they fail to comply with party rules. Brown said
that proposal would permit the party to exert reasonable pressure
on states rather than be faced with a choice of unseating entire
delegations or ignoring rules violations.

   Civil rights leader Ralph David Abernathy
remained hospitalized in fair condition Friday for a sodium
imbalance, but was ``not in great danger,'' his physician said.
   Abernathy was brought to Crawford Long Hospital of Emory
University Thursday night after his wife reported that he ``wasn't
his usual self,'' said Dr. Robert Kaufmann, Abernathy's physician.
He was ``somewhat lethargic, and not as alert as he usually is,''
Kaufmann said.
   Abernathy was diagnosed with hyponatremia _ an electrolytic
imbalance, or low sodium count, in his bloodstream. The sodium
deficiency was probably triggered by nausea Abernathy suffered two
days earlier, coupled with diuretics he takes for high blood
pressure, Kaufmann said.
   A sodium imbalance can be life threatening, but Abernathy is
responding to fluids treatment, Kaufmann said.
   ``I don't think he's in great danger at this point,'' the doctor
said, adding that Abernathy was alert Friday morning, asking,
``How'm I doing?''
   A possible complication of sodium imbalance is arrythmia, or an
irregular heartbeat, and Abernathy is being monitored in the
hospital's cardiac care unit. However, he is not suffering from
heart trouble.
   The 63-year-old minister and civil rights leader could be
hospitalized a week or so, depending on how he responds to
treatment, Kaufmann said.
   Abernathy, pastor Atlanta's West Hunter Street Baptist Church,
has a recent history of health problems, including strokes in 1983
and 1986. He had been hospitalized recently, but Kaufmann declined
to say what prompted that hospitalization.
   Abernathy worked with Martin Luther King Jr. during the early
years of the civil rights movement, but his relationship with many
former colleagues has been strained in recent years.
   He angered many of them last year when his autobiography, ``And
The Walls Came Tumbling Down,'' suggested that King committed
adultery the night before he was assassinated. A Memphis, Tenn.,
woman last month sued Abernathy for libel over the passage.

<HEAD>$100 Million in Mental Health Funds Squandered, Consumer Group
Contends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal program to provide community mental
health services to the poor and uninsured is an ``abysmal failure''
because up to $100 million was squandered building for-profit
hospitals with swimming pools and tennis courts, a consumer group
charged Friday.
   Half of 575 community mental health centers funded under the
program are violating federal regulations that require them to be
non-profit, to provide certain essential services and to make some
services available to the poor, Public Citizen Health Research
Group said.
   ``One of the most visible consequences of the failed program has
been a significant increase in the number of seriously mentally ill
homeless and an increase in the number of mentally ill persons in
jails and prisons,'' the group's report said.
   ``The Community Mental Health Centers program has been an
abysmal failure,'' the report said.
   A report by the House Government Operations subcommittee on
human resources and intergovernmental relations chaired by Rep. Ted
Weiss, D-N.Y., said its investigation has revealed the same kinds
of violations.
   Weiss called for a General Accounting Office investigation to
determine the extent of the problem.
   And the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human
Services is beginning an investigation of the matter, in response
to a request by HHS Undersecretary Constance Horner, a spokeswoman
for the inspector general said.
   Alan Leshner, deputy director of the National Institute of
Mental Health, said officials are aware of problems with the
program and 10 months ago began to identify centers out of
compliance and to seek recoveries.
   Asked if he were aware of any fraud or abuse, Leshner said, ``I
don't know of it and if we do know of it, we will correct it ...
That doesn't mean that there aren't centers that are out of
compliance, but I don't see any fraud and abuse.''
   Public Citizen said that between $50 million and $100 million is
owed the federal government by mental health centers that received
federal construction grants under the program and are out of
compliance.
   It based the estimate on reports of inspections of 158 centers
in the program. The inspections were conducted by a company under
contract to NIMH and were obtained by Public Citizen and the
National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.
   Some 575 community mental health centers have received grants
under the program since it began in 1967.
   So far, NIMH has recovered only $3.8 million from 10 of those
that received grants but were found to be out of compliance, Public
Citizen said.
   All of this was collected from 1983-86, when Paul Curtis was
headed the program at NIMH, the group said.
   In a statement included in Public Citizen's report, Curtis said
that while he found many of the hospitals out of compliance, he was
``actively discouraged from seeking recoveries'' by his superiors
at NIMH. Curtis retired in 1986.
   Grants under the program require a community mental health
center to provide five essential services to the mentally ill for
at least 20 years, and require that they provide a ``reasonable
volume of services'' to the poor. The required services are
inpatient, outpatient, partial hospitalization, emergency services
and consultation and education.
   As an example of centers the group contends are seriously out of
compliance, Public Citizen cited the Orlando Regional Medical
Center in Florida, which received $731,912 in 1967. With some of
those funds, ``it built a swimming pool and tennis courts ... hired
a gardner, lifeguard and swimming instructor,'' Public Citizen's
report said.
   DePaul Hospital in New Orleans, which received $475,484 in
construction funds and opened in 1972, was sold to a for-profit
company the next year, the group said.
   Leshner attributed some of the problems with the 23-year-old
program to the philosophy of the program's leaders during previous
administrations.
   ``The previous philosophy was that it's better to provide some
service than to shut down a mental health center and have all the
money go into the Treasury and not be used for mental health,'' he
said.
   ``Perhaps too much was done to get noncompliance centers into
compliance,'' he said. ``At some point, you have to say, `OK, this
isn't going to work. We have to get the recovery.'''
   NIMH was alerted to the problems by the inspection contractor,
Continuing Medical Education Inc., and began an audit 10 months
ago. The audit found ``no major problems but some procedural
changes were called for, and a number of them were put in place,''
Leshner said.
   The institute also compiled a list of 33 centers in the program
that had been identified as having compliance problems. NIMH staff
will visit all of those centers by June, Leshner said.
   The institute also will visit by Sept. 30 the 72 centers that
have received waivers of the requirements during the past two
years, he said.
   Leshner said he could not estimate the amount of money NIMH will
seek from the centers that are out of compliance.

   President Bush said Friday he is ``deeply
offended by some of the filth'' that passes for art and receives
federal grants, but that he's not about to propose government
censorship.
   ``I don't know of anybody in the government ... that should be
set up to censor what you write, or what you paint, or how you
express yourself,'' Bush said.
   The president made the comments at a question-and-answer session
in the White House with out-of-town editors and reporters. He was
asked about his administration's opposition to placing restrictions
on financing from the National Endowment for the Arts for
controversial art.
   The administration's position was outlined earlier this week by
NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer at a congressional hearing. The agency
has come under mounting criticism from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
and other conservatives who claim it is ignoring a congressional
ban, imposed for this fiscal year, on financing obscene art.
   Some critics have proposed legislation to place even more
stringent restrictions on federal arts financing, but Frohnmayer
said the White House opposes extending such restrictions into the
next fiscal year.
   Bush supported Frohnmayer and said he opposes any efforts to
write art standards into law.
   ``I am deeply offended by some of the filth that I see and to
which federal money has gone; and by some of the sacrilegious,
blasphemous depictions that are portrayed by some to be art,'' Bush
said.
   But he said that while he will ``speak strongly out'' against
such art, ``I would prefer to have this matter handled by a very
sensitive, knowledgeable man of the arts, John Frohnmayer, than
risk censorship or getting the federal government into telling
every artist what he or she can paint. ...''
   ``So I am against censorship, but I will try to convince those
who feel differently in terms of legislation that we will do
everything in our power to stop pure blasphemy.''
   Bush said ``two horrendous examples'' came to mind ``of what I
would call blasphemous material that has no business getting one
cent of the taxpayers' money.''
   But, he added, ``I don't want to offend the American people'' by
describing those particular works.
   Bush engaged in a wide-ranging exchange with the reporters and
editors, in which he also:
   _Said that any attempt by the Soviet Union to use force to put
down Lithuania's bid for independence was ``bound to backfire.'' He
also reiterated his criticism of Congress for not moving faster on
his $800 million aid package for Panama and Nicaragua.
   _Said that, despite progress on the human-rights front in South
Africa, it was still not time ``to change the policy'' of U.S.
economic sanctions on Pretoria. He suggested that he first wants a
chance to meet with South African President F.W. deKlerk and black
nationalist leader Nelson Mandela. Both have been invited,
separately, to the White House but dates have yet to be set.
   _Defended spending money to aid new democracies instead of
putting more into domestic programs, saying it was important to
``help create stable democracies that will actively trade with the
United States.''
   _Declared himself opposed to statehood for the District of
Columbia. ``This is a federal city and my view is it should remain
that,'' he said. ``Put me down as unsympathetic to that particular
cause.''

<HEAD>Construction Site Collapse Kills Two</HEAD>

   A 100-foot-long wall being erected atop a
warehouse toppled onto an adjoining roof Friday, smashing through
in an avalanche of debris that killed two people and critically
injured two others, officials said.
   Ten other people suffered less serious injuries in the collapse
at the Century 21 Department Stores warehouse in Brooklyn. The dead
and injured included construction workers and employees in the
building below.
   ``I just heard the big noise. It sounded like a building
falling,'' Fannie DeBlasio, a neighbor, said of the 9:15 a.m.
accident. ``I looked out the window and saw people running.''
   Workers were adding a second floor to the one-story warehouse
when the new wall _ a foot thick, 14 feet high and 100 feet long _
fell on an adjoining one-story building, also owned by Century 21,
officials said.
   The debris smashed a 30-by-30-foot hole through the roof of the
second building, killing a woman working inside, rescuers said. A
construction worker also was killed.
   The Buildings Department had approved construction plans and
issued permits for work at the site, but apparently only for a
ground-floor extension, not a second-floor addition, said spokesman
Vahe Tiryakian.
   ``They had a permit. But it appears the permit did not include
permission to do the work they were doing,'' Tiryakian said. The
department was investigating, he said.
   The permit was issued to a Vortex Contracting Corp. in Queens,
Tiryakian said. There was no telephone listing for a Vortex in
Queens; officials at a Vortex listed in Brooklyn did not return a
telephone call.
   The city ordered the contractor to shore up another wall it had
built atop the 100-by-100 foot warehouse, then to stop work while
an engineer determined what caused the accident.
   Century 21 closed its main outlet for the day. An official at a
Manhattan branch, Alex Esarco, said he had no information and was
waiting for company officials to return from the site.
   Some of the injured were trapped initially, but police said all
were removed within an hour.
   Police identified those killed as Luz Serrano, 47, of Brooklyn,
who was dead at the scene, and Sean Campbell, 33, a construction
worker from the Bronx, pronounced dead at Victory Memorial Hospital.
   A 28-year-old construction worker and a 20-year-old Century 21
employee were admitted to Lutheran Medical Center in critical
condition, said spokesman Robert Walsh. One was in stable
condition, the other ``alert'' but more seriously hurt, he said.
   Another man was admitted to Victory with broken ribs, and two
men were treated there for inhaling fumes, and then released, said
spokeswoman Angela Canade. The Emergency Medical Service treated
seven people at the scene.

   A Treasury Department official nominated to
the Federal Reserve Board promised Friday that he would exercise
independent judgment rather than serve as an agent of the
administration's push to lower interest rates.
   ``If confirmed I pledge ... I will exercise my independent
judgment on matters before the board,'' David W. Mullins Jr. told
the Senate Banking Committee.
   Mullins, 43, is assistant Treasury secretary and one of the
architects of President Bush's savings and loan bailout. He has
been a professor at the Harvard Business School.
   President Bush nominated him in November to serve the remaining
six years in the term of H. Robert Heller, who resigned. The
committee also reviewed the nomination of Edward Kelley Jr., 58, a
Fed board member for the past three years, to a new 14-year term.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the committee,
and Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., said they worried that Mullins was
being appointed to do the administration's bidding at the central
bank, which sets the nation's monetary policy and controls
short-term interest rates.
   ``I certainly hope you're going as your own man, with absolute
independence of mind and thought,'' Riegle said.
   Mullins said he would ``seek counsel from all quarters'' but
make his own decisions.
   Sarbanes noted that Mullins had been interviewed by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, Budget Director Richard Darman, White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu and White House economic adviser
Michael Boskin.
   ``I think you're being nominated because you're pretty much on
the same wave length as the people who interviewed you,'' he said.
   Administration officials, from the president down, have
periodically criticized the Fed for being overly worried about
inflation and keeping interest rates too high.
   A recent published report quoted an unidentified Bush adviser as
saying the president was ``mad as hell'' not inclined to reappoint
Alan Greenspan when his term as Fed chairman expires next year.
   Mullins said he believed accounts of a rift between the
administration and the Fed were exaggerated, adding, ``It is not
unusual for the president to call for lower interest rates.''
   However, he said there was ``no compelling evidence'' that the
Fed's current policy of relatively high interest rates is unsound.
   On other topics, Mullins:
   _Called for reform of the ``too-big-to-fail doctrine'' in which
regulators bail out all depositors of failing big banks, even over
the $100,000 insurance limit. He said the Drexel Burnham failure
proves that big financial firms can fail without threatening the
financial system.
   _Said he did not believe the central bank should try to improve
the U.S. trade deficit by managing the value of the dollar in
currency markets. Central bank intervention is appropriate only to
steady markets or if the value of the dollar has deviated ``from
economic fundamentals.''
   _Defended the administration's S&amp;L bailout, saying the major
reason for the slow start was ``the massive complexity of the
task'' rather than any flaw in last summer's legislation.
   Riegle said he would support Mullins' nomination.

<HEAD>Carter Finds Calmer Middle East, But Mum on Hostage Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter found a calmer
Middle East on his latest fact-finding mission, but a solution to
the hostage issue ``is not around the corner,'' according to a
Middle East expert who accompanied him.
   Kenneth Stein, who advised the ex-president on his tour of
Egypt, Syria, Jordan, the West Bank and Israel this month, also
said that recent Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union had
aroused rancor from Arab countries.
   During his tour, Carter had private conversations with several
heads of state about the 18 Western hostages believed held by
Shiite Moslem groups in Lebanon, but Stein would not divulge the
content of the talks.
   Carter will meet with Bush administration officials and members
of Congress Tuesday to discuss ``sensitive issues'' of his trip and
may reveal further details after that, Stein said.
   Stein said Carter denied reports Friday that he had any
communication about the hostages from Sheik Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah, the reputed spiritual leader of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah group.
   The weekly magazine Ash-Shiraa in Beirut reported the same day
that Fadlallah had responded through an intermediary to questions
Carter had posed about the issue, but Carter, in Hawaii, said he
had asked no questions, Stein said.
   Ash-Shiraa gained international recognition in 1987 for breaking
the story that the Reagan administration was trading arms for U.S.
hostages. However, its frequent reports that a hostage release was
imminent have not proven accurate.
   Stein said Carter had no reaction to Fadlallah, Lebanon's most
influential Shiite Moslem cleric, stating that ``a new situation
has emerged'' with regard to the possibility of a hostage release.
   But Stein said Carter was encouraged when during his trip to
Syria, that country's foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, said he
``saw no reason to be pessimistic'' about progress toward the
hostages' freedom.
   ``He has since gone to Tehran to urge them to continue to be
flexible,'' Stein said. ``I don't think the Syrian foreign minister
would make a statement like that unless there was some progress.
... But a solution is not around the corner.''
   The United States should be encouraged also that Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad is ``bolstering'' the Middle East peace
process, Stein said. Syria will announce next month that it is
sending an ambassador to Washington and has said it will help
negotiate a settlement in Lebanon's civil war.
   ``These are all signals, noises Washington wants to hear,''
Stein said, but he added that Assad's support of state-sponsored
terrorism is still questionable.
   Stein, an Emory University Middle East expert who accompanied
Carter on two previous trips to the region, also said he was
surprised that the immigration of Soviet Jews has set Arab nations
in turmoil.
   ``I didn't know how upset they'd be,'' he said. ``Jordan is
beside herself at the prospect, the real belief, that these
Russian-Jewish immigrants will settle in the West Bank and will
drive out the Palestinians.
   ``In Egypt, Syria and Jordan there are certain voices ... who
believe there is a conspiracy between Moscow and Washington with
Moscow providing the bodies and Washington providing the money, and
doing it intentionally to hurt the Arabs. I was really surprised at
that.''
   The Carter Presidential Center will use information gleaned from
the trip when it hosts an international forum in November to
discuss economic means to promote further peace, Stein said.

   At his parents' home, Mike painted his room
black, decorated it with black candles and an altar, and put up
obituaries and Satanic symbols on the walls.
   He began driving recklessly, drinking heavily, experimenting
with marijuana and threatening his parents.
   That's when Mike ended up in one of the nation's first treatment
programs aimed at weaning disturbed teen-agers from Satanism.
   ``At the time, Satanism seemed to have, for Mike, a lot of
answers that he couldn't find elsewhere,'' said Michael Weiss, a
psychologist who specializes in treating adolescents. ``It gave him
the sense that he could control all things.''
   ``Now that he can find other ways to feel good and have some
sense of purpose ... he seems increasingly willing to put aside any
Satanic influence,'' said Weiss, of Hartgrove Hospital on Chicago's
North Side.
   ``He successfully went through the in-patient program and at
this point is continuing in treatment on an outpatient basis with
individual therapy and also some family therapy. To date no major
crises and no return to any satanic involvement, that we're aware
of at least.''
   Mike _ not his real name _ is among about a half dozen youths,
ranging from ages 14 to 17, who've received treatment or are
undergoing therapy at Hartgrove's Center for the Treatment of
Ritualistic Deviance.
   The center, attached to the hospital's adolescent unit, began
receiving patients in October. The in-patient program lasts four to
eight weeks, and involves individual as well as group therapy.
   Most patients are admitted voluntarily based on referrals from
mental health workers, police and parents.
   Weiss said it's still too early to determine the success rate.
   ``We didn't know what to expect ... but I'm pleased with the way
things are right now,'' he said. ``We're certainly finding that we
can work with these kids and their families.''
   A similar program exists at Denver's Bethesda PsychHealth
System. And Hartgrove has received inquiries from hospitals in
Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin interested in starting their own
Satanism treatment programs, said social worker Dale Trahan.
   ``I definitely see the problem as growing,'' said Trahan, who's
been researching satanic beliefs for three years and was contracted
to set up Hartgrove's center.
   ``The factors that seem to be adding to a growth of the occult
don't seem to be going away _ a breakdown in family, an abandonment
of traditional values, resistance towards traditional religious
beliefs, and an increasing number of youths who feel both alienated
and powerless over their lives and future,'' Trahan said.
   ``So many kids are feeling like they're ... not going to get
their needs met using traditional means so they're looking for
alternatives ... and there are many destructive alternatives'' such
as street gangs, neo-Nazi groups, drugs and Satanism, Trahan said.
   There has been a marked increase in the number of young people
involved in Satanism, said Cynthia Kisser, executive director of
the Chicago-based Cult Awareness Network, a non-profit organization
that has 30 volunteer chapters around the country.
   Two years ago, the network got only one or two calls a month
regarding Satanism. Now, there are as many as 300 a month, Ms.
Kisser said.
   Weiss cautions that just because parents find that a teen-ager
is into heavy metal music or wearing Satanic symbols, it doesn't
mean he's a candidate for Hartgrove's program.
   ``Kids are admitted because they are having emotional or
behavioral problems ... coupled with involvement in occult and
Satanic beliefs,'' he said.
   Some warning signs include a sudden drop in school grades,
withdrawal from the family, increasing drug or alcohol use and
increasingly aggressive behavior, Trahan said.
   Satanic beliefs often can make traditional treatment approaches
unsuccessful because a teen-ager can use the occult as a defensive
mechanism, Weiss said.
   Trahan said staff members are advised not to react with shock or
fear to Satanic beliefs because this would only encourage the
patient to believe in the power of the occult.
   About 35 to 40 hospital staff members _ psychiatrists and
psychologists, physical and recreational therapists, social
workers, teachers and nurses _ are involved in the program and have
received special training.
   Trahan said the program doesn't have anything in common with
deprogramming _ the radical therapy used to break some youths away
from cults that use psychological manipulation to gain members.
   ``We help them identify constructive alternatives. That's not
brainwashing,'' Trahan said.
   Said Weiss: ``Our overall goal is to have a kid walk out of here
who is going to be able to adapt to the world and live a
reasonable, safe and sane life.''

<HEAD>Mystery Illness Spreads in Kosovo; Tests Find No Poison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mysterious illness that has felled
hundreds of children in ethnically divided Kosovo province appeared
to be spreading there Friday, Tanjug news agency reported. It said
tests uncovered no poison.
   In violence arising from the incident, Slavs were reported to
have been beaten by ethnic Albanians Friday in Vucitrn, about 18
miles northwest of Pristina, and at least 10 were hospitalized,
Radio Belgrade reported.
   On Friday morning, police moved into the streets of Vucitrn,
filled with demonstrators, to regain control.
   Representatives of the ethnic Albanian opposition in Kosovo
disputed the official Tanjug report, claiming the medical team
involved was not impartial.
   The affliction causes breathing difficulties and eye and stomach
pains. The report said nothing about what might have caused
symptoms.
   Opposition leaders earlier claimed an unidentified chemical was
poured or sprayed into classrooms, leading to poisoning of teen-age
students in several Kosovo towns. But Belgrade medical experts said
blood, urine and gastric juice tests revealed no poisoning.
   Hundreds of children were hospitalized in Pristina, Kosovo's
capital, on Thursday. Most were released on Friday when 240 more
patients, mostly teen-agers, were admitted with similar complaints,
Tanjug said.
   An official medical team, set up by the Federal Ministry for
Health, in cooperation with Serbia's Health Ministry and Pristina's
Medical Faculty, said 18 people were admitted to the hospital in
Pristina from Monday through Wednesday, complaining of weakness,
breathing difficulty, chest pains, dry mouth and fainting.
   On Thursday, 352 more people, mostly aged 16-18, were
hospitalized with the same symptoms, the official report said.
   Clinical examinations established redness on the cheeks and a
mild swelling of the ears, while in a smaller number of patients,
conjunctivitis, an eye infection, was also found, Tanjug said,
quoting the official medical bulletin.
   The skin redness disappeared after an hour and special treatment
was not needed, the release said.
   Medical experts also took blood, urine and gastric juice samples
for toxicological examination at the Military Medical Academy in
Belgrade, the best-equipped hospital in eastern Yugoslavia.
   Initial results of the analyses do not indicate ``the presence
of poisonous substances,'' Tanjug reported.
   The medical team said that overall, no signs emerged of an
epidemic involving an infectious disease or of poisoning.
   But representatives of Kosovo's democratic opposition, asked for
comment by The Associated Press, criticized the medical team's
report.
   Academician Rexhep Qosja of the Albanological Institute of
Pristina said the finding was ``not sufficiently clear.''
   Ibrahim Rugova, a historian and author, said, ``I doubt the
finding since it was not reached by a neutral commission.''
   He said the commission representing a federal ministry was not
neutral enough and alleged ``manipulation.''
   Most of the original patients were expected to be released by
weekend, officials said.
   In clashes with security forces the last 13 months, at least 60
people have been killed as ethnic Albanians were protesting
constitutional changes that gave Serbia close control over Kosovo.
   Serbian leaders contend the changes were necessary to protect
minority Slavs from virtual daily harassment by ethnic Albanians.

   Here is a list of measures to restrict abortion laws in the
United States following last summer's U.S. Supreme Court ruling in
Missouri's Webster case, which gave states more authority to
restrict abortions:
   _The Idaho Legislature on Thursday approved a law that would
make abortion illegal except in cases of non-statutory rape
reported within seven days, incest if the victim is younger than
18, severe fetal deformity or a threat to the mother's life or
physical health. The law is now under consideration by Gov. Cecil
Andrus.
   _In Guam, a new law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy
endangers the life of the mother. Among other things, it makes it a
felony to perform abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor
for a woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a
person to solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   A judge on Friday issued a temporary restraining order on
enforcing the law, which is more restrictive than the bill passed
by the Idaho Legislature.
   _In Maryland, the Senate passed an abortion rights bill on
Friday permitting unrestricted abortions during the early stages of
pregnancy. It will become law unless it is petitioned to referendum
and rejected by voters in November.
   If it is rejected, then a bill sponsored by anti-abortion
senators will become law _ unless it also is defeated by voters.
Under that bill, abortions could be performed in cases of rape or
incest, to protect the mother's life or if the pregnancy would
produce serious and adverse effects on the woman's health.
   _In South Carolina, lawmakers approved legislation that requires
minors to get permission from a parent or a judge before having an
abortion. Parents who deny a daughter's request for an abortion
would have share legal and financial responsibility for her child
until the young mother turns 18.
   _In Pennsylvania, the governor in December signed a bill that
requires married women to notify husbands about abortion plans. The
law also bans abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy and
compels women to wait 24 hours after learning of their pregnancy
before getting an abortion.

   A judge, denouncing the ``shame'' that
Joseph Hazelwood brought upon himself in the Exxon Valdez disaster,
sentenced the skipper to help clean up the beaches of Prince
William Sound and said he must pay $50,000 in restitution to the
state.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone, in sentencing Hazelwood to
1,000 hours of community service in the clean-up, said he was
disappointed that Hazelwood had not publicly apologized for his
role in the grounding of his tanker.
   He said he felt Hazelwood was wrong to drink before he boarded
his ship and believed he violated at least some Coast Guard
regulations.
   The judge, who presided over the fired skipper's seven-week
trial, also gave Hazelwood 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine, the
maximum under his misdemeanor conviction, but suspended both.
   ``I'm sure deep down he is very shameful,'' the judge said of
Hazelwood.
   A 12-member jury found Hazelwood guilty Thursday of a
misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil into state waters.

   The national airline Aeroflot closed one of the
main routes for Jews emigrating to Israel, halting ticket sales to
Budapest on Friday, and denied it had opened another one through
Egypt, Soviet media reported.
   The closure followed a decision by Hungary's Malev airline to
stop flights of Soviet Jews to Tel Aviv via Budapest because of the
threat of terrorist attacks. Israeli officials denounced it as a
``classic example of terrorist blackmail.''
   On Thursday, Malev appealed to Aeroflot to stop bringing Jewish
emigres into Hungary.
   Soviet TV said Aeroflot would not sell tickets to emigrants
wanting to travel to Budapest from Moscow, Leningrad and the
Ukrainian capital of Kiev. It said it would still transport
businessmen and tourists. Malev also will continue selling tickets
to tourists.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said on Israel TV late Friday that
the Hungarian move surprised him. He said the state-run Hungarian
airline was ``surrendering to terror.''
   Arens said he had been unable to speak to Hungary's foreign
minister, but that if the reports are true, he will ask Hungary to
reverse the decision.
   Budapest, the Romanian capital of Bucharest and several other
European cities have become the transit points for Soviet Jews
using Aeroflot. No figures have been available on how many Soviet
Jews have used those routes.
   Malev began transporting the immigrants last year following
Hungary's resumption of diplomatic ties with Israel.
   Hungarian officials said they cut off ticket sales to emigrants
because of threats from Palestinian extremists. The pro-Iranian
Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine has threatened
airlines of all countries involved in transportation of Soviet
Jewish immigrants to Israel.
   Immigration activists expressed their disappointment with
Hungary's decision, demanding that authorities open as many routes
as possible.
   Palestinian and Arab leaders view the immigration of Soviet Jews
to Israel as a grave threat and have launched an unprecedented
anti-immigration campaign. Their concern is based on statements by
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir suggesting Israel needed to retain
the occupied territories to settle Soviet Jews.
   Israel last month imposed censorship on immigration figures,
routes of exit and the projected number of immigrants, citing a
danger of attacks by Palestinian extremists. Israeli media also
quoted security sources as saying Israel has beefed up security for
immigrants.
   According to official Israeli figures, about 16,700 Soviet Jews
emigrated to Israel from Jan. 1, 1989, to Feb. 1, 1990. They joined
about 180,000 of their brethren who have come to the country since
1967.
   Israeli officials say they expect 750,000 Soviet Jews to arrive
in the next decade as the result of the Soviet Union's more liberal
emigration policies and stricter U.S. entrance requirements.
   About 200 new immigrants have joined 70,000 Jews who live in the
occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip, home to about 1.7 million
Palestinians and the scene of the 27-month uprising against Israeli
rule.
   Israel says it has no policy of directing immigrants to the
territories, which it captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East War.
   Transportation problems and the difficulties in obtaining
tickets to European destinations prompted suggestions some
immigrants may be coming to Israel via Cairo. Egypt is the only
Arab country at peace with Israel.
   The deputy head of Aeroflot's Cairo office, A. Ananyin, told the
newspaper Trud on Tuesday that the company has added a second
flight each week to Cairo. He said there would be one additional
flight every two weeks in March and then more frequently.
   But Ananyin denied Aeroflot carried any emigrants to Egypt. ``We
meet and see off every flight, and I can state with full
responsibility that no emigrant has so far traveled to Israel via
Cairo.''
   He said the flights were carrying some Soviet Jews who traveled
to Israel for short-term family visits. He justified the additional
flight by citing an increase in tourism and business traffic.
   Trud, published by the Soviet labor unions, said official Soviet
figures indicated a threefold increase in Soviet tourism in Egypt
and said the number of businessmen traveling there has recently
doubled.
   Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov said
Aeroflot had no plans to make direct flights to Israel, the
government newspaper Izvestia said.
   Last year, Aeroflot concluded an agreement with Israel's El Al
airline on direct flights, but Soviet authorities have refused to
ratify it, citing Shamir's ideas on the settlement of Soviet Jews
in the occupied territories.
   Vorontsov dismissed Arab demands that Jewish emigration be
stopped completely, saying that the Soviet emigration policy and
its expected further liberalization ``conform with international
standards.''

<HEAD>Bush Says U.S. Taking New Look At California Shipping Lanes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Friday his administration
is taking a ``whole new look'' at the possibility of shifting
shipping lanes off the coast of California to get oil tankers
farther away from beaches.
   But spokesmen for the departments Bush said were dealing with
the matter were caught by surprise by the president's statement,
made at a White House gathering with out-of-town newspaper editors,
and said they knew of no new study other than Coast Guard efforts
to revise complex shipping rules proposed a year ago.
   Bush's assertion followed a proposal on Thursday from an
environmental group that a 25-mile-wide ``vessel-free zone'' be
established along the central California coast to lessen the damage
from crude oil tanker spills.
   A study by the Natural Resources Defense Council said a buffer
that keeps oil tankers away from the shore would allow additional
response time for cleanup teams before oil hits the beaches.
   Bush said the Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency
and the Transportation and Energy departments were trying to take
``a whole new look ... as to shipping lanes, to see what is the
best _ whether there is a way to shift the shipping lanes to avert
proximity to the beaches as much as possible.''
   The president said it would not be possible to deny oil tankers
access to the California coast because the oil is needed.
   ``The answer is: Make it as safe as possible,'' he said.
   Bush said the federal agencies are cooperating with California
environmental authorities on the issue.
   ``But if you're saying to me, `Can the federal government
guarantee that no tanker will ever again have a leak or spill oil?'
no, I can't do that,'' Bush said. ``But we can go the extra mile in
terms of environmental protection, safeguarding the sea lanes and
all of that.''
   A Coast Guard spokesman, Cmdr. John McElwain, said 299 letters
were received on a proposed rule last April to set sea lanes off
portions of the California coast, and ``289 didn't like the
proposals.'' Public hearings in California also brought mostly
criticism, he said.
   McElwain said the agency is now awaiting the results of an
environmental study of the impact of shipping lanes on wildlife
before proposing a new rule.
   The spokesman said, however, that he was not aware of a specific
study on setting shipping channels farther from shore.
   Currently, only limited sea lanes are defined and ships rely on
``rules of prudent seamanship'' along most of the coast, McElwain
said.
   Transportation Department spokesman Bob Marx and Energy
Department spokesman Phillip Keif said they were not aware of a new
study on the matter. A call to the EPA's public affairs office was
not returned before the office closed on Friday.

   Despite escalating tensions, a Lithuanian
independence leader said Friday he still believes Moscow will avoid
force and eventually negotiate with the breakaway republic.
   Lithuania on Friday accused Moscow of waging psychological
warfare to force the republic to renounce its declaration of
independence on March 11.
   The Kremlin has moved troops in a show of force, confiscated
weapons, called for abolishing local defense units, and demanded
that Lithuanian deserters return to the Soviet military.
   ``I think this absurdity is a duel of David and Goliath that is
understandable for the whole world and in the end Moscow, sooner or
later, will agree on negotiations,'' said Virgilijus Cepaitis, a
deputy in the Lithuanian parliament and secretary general of the
Sajudis independence movement.
   Asked at a news conference if he thought Moscow would abide by
public declarations it would not to use force, Cepaitis replied,
``Yes, I believe in this.''
   Deputies attending a regular session of Poland's parliament gave
Cepaitis and another Lithuanian leader a standing ovation when they
entered the legislature's main chamber. Cepjaitis' colleague was
Kaziemeras Motieka, vice president of the Lithuanian Supreme
Council.
   The pair also reported on the standoff between Moscow and
Lithuania to members of the Solidarity delegation of the Polish
parliament.
   The Lithuanians were given a copy of a declaration passed by the
Polish parliament Thursday welcoming the Baltic republic to the
family of free nations.
   The Lithuanian cause has won great sympathy among the Polish,
who have long historial ties with Lithuania. More than 100 students
on Friday demonstrated in Warsaw to support the Lithuanians.

<DATELINE>TIRGU MURES, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania retracted on Friday
accusations made by authorities that Hungary fueled ethnic tensions
that led to deadly riots in Transylvania.
   And strikes that nearly paralyzed this ethnically split
Transylvanian town all week ended Friday as government emissaries
replaced both the city and Mures county leaderships, which had been
accused of failing to prevent this week's clashes between Romanians
and ethnic Hungarians.
   The government issued a statement denying accusations made
Wednesday after Premier Petre Roman met in Bucharest, the capital,
with representatives of Mures and other areas affected by the
unrest.
   ``It is not true that ... citizens from Hungary incited the
ethnic Hungarians to violence,'' said the statement read on evening
television news.
   It also said the government was dissociating itself from
``charges being brought against'' ethnic Hungarians that they want
to secede from Romania.
   ``The government will call to account all those who disseminate
lies,'' the declaration said, adding that the Ministry of Education
will act immediately to ensure that the Hungarian language is
introduced in schools in Transylvania, where most of the 2 million
ethnic Hungarians live.
   In a TV interview broadcast late Friday, however, Roman blasted
Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn for criticizing the conduct
of Romanian authorities during the violence in Tirgu Mures, where
seven people died and 300 were hurt.
   Tirgu Mures, where riots peaked Tuesday night, was calm Friday
after a commission of inquiry agreed that the Hungarian minority
has a right to education in their native tongue, an issue that
contributed to the clashes.
   Life appeared to have returned to normal and industrial
enterprises were reported to be operating again.
   Elementary schools were closed because of fears of renewed
violence, Rompres news agency reported.
   Shops reopened and city buses, the target of attacks earlier
this week, were back on the streets.
   But tension still ran high in the outlying villages of Mures
province, where youths armed with sticks roamed the countryside.
   ``I still don't dare to drive out into the (nearby) Hungarian
villages,'' said municipal bus driver Constantin Buciu. Mountainous
Transylvania has about 2 million ethnic Hungarians and about 5
million Romanians.
   Hungary ruled the region for hundreds of years until the end of
World War I when Transylvania was ceded to Romania by the
victorious Allied powers.
   Some Romanians accuse ethnic Hungarians of trying to separate
the region from Romania in order to rejoin Hungary.
   Hungarians deny that they harbor separatist sentiments and say
they only want cultural and other ethnic rights.
   They, along with other national minorities, were oppressed under
longtime Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was ousted and
executed in December.

   The Coast Guard on Friday suspended its
search for the bodies of nine men presumed drowned after their
fishing trawler capsized and sank in the frigid Bering Sea.
   Fishing vessels rescued 22 crew members who had abandoned the
sinking ship on life boats. They were reported in good condition
aboard a trawler that was taking them to Dutch Harbor, about 250
miles southeast of the accident site.
   The nine, including a federal fisheries observer, were lost
Thursday when the 162-foot Aleutian Enterprise sank, according to
the Coast Guard, which said there was little chance their bodies
would be found.
   ``We had a very good search yesterday,'' Lt. Brian Flory said
Friday in Juneau. ``We think we would have found anyone who was
afloat.''
   Several fishing vessels remained in the area to look for bodies
Friday, but they also gave up, said Dan Roberts, executive vice
president of Arctic Alaska Fisheries Corp. in Seattle, whic''
Haley said.
   The Coast Guard will convene a formal board of investigation
into the accident at noon Saturday in Anchorage, Haley said.
Roberts said some survivors and company officials would attend,
weather permitting.
   The Seattle-based ship sank about 60 miles south of the Pribilof
Islands town of St. Paul, which is north of the Aleutian Islands
chain and southwest of the Alaska mainland.
   Roberts agreed that continuing the search would be useless.
   ``The boats searched for seven hours yesterday, they searched
all night. With the water temperature 32 to 34 degrees, it's
doubtful they would have survived,'' he said.
   The Coast Guard earlier reported that 10 people were missing,
but the figure was revised to nine after officials discovered one
crewman apparently had stayed off the ship at its last port.
   None of the crew was wearing survival suits, said Haley. Coast
Guard officials said a person couldn't survive the frigid water
more than 30 minutes without insulated survival gear.
   The survivors were transferred to the Bristol Enterprise, which
wasn't expected to arrive in Dutch Harbor until late Friday, Haley
said.
   From there they were to be flown home as soon as possible,
weather permitting, Roberts said. Most of the crew members are from
the Seattle area, he said.
   Lt. Cmdr. Richard Blaze of the Coast Guard's licensing and
inspection office in Anchorage said the agency has no file on the
Aleutian Enterprise. Nor does another inspection agency, the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said Victor Brandt
of the OSHA office in Anchorage.
   The Aleutian Enterprise was part of a fleet of so-called factory
trawlers that fish for cod and pollock in the remote Bering Sea
between Alaska and the Soviet Union. The large vessels catch the
bottom fish, process and freeze them on board.
   The vessel is owned by Aleutian Enterprise Ltd., a
California-based partnership that contracts with Arctic Alaska for
management and marketing services, Roberts said.
   The company the identitified the nine men presumed drowned as

   The Duchess of York gave birth to a 7-pound,
1{-ounce daughter by Caesarean section Friday night, and mother and
child are both well, Portland Hospital announced.
   It was the second child and second girl for the 30-year-old
duchess and her husband Prince Andrew, and is the sixth grandchild
of Queen Elizabeth II.
   The new baby, daughter of the queen's second son, is sixth in
line to the British throne after her sister, Princess Beatrice of
York, who was born Aug. 8, 1988.
   Andrew was present at the delivery at 7:58 p.m. (2:58 p.m. EST),
the hospital statement said.
   The Caesarean section was carried out because the baby was in a
breech position, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. ``It was the
wrong way round,'' he said.
   The duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, had spent the last week
at Buckingham Palace in London instead of her country home. She
arrived at the London hospital nearly four hours earlier in a
chauffeur-driven car and entered through a side entrance, avoiding
photographers waiting at the front.
   Her husband joined her two hours later after driving the 150
miles from Devonport naval dockyard, where he is based as a flight
commander on the Royal Navy frigate Campbeltown.
   As tradition dictates, a notice was posted on the railings at
Buckingham Palace giving news of the birth.
   It read: ``Her Royal Highness the Duchess of York was safely
delivered of a daughter at 7:58 p.m. today. Her Royal Highness and
her child are well.''
   The birth was greeted by cheering and the cracking of champagne
corks by a small crowd of well-wishers outside the hospital.
   The Duchess of York's father, Maj. Ronald Ferguson, said at his
home at Dummer, a village 53 miles southwest of London: ``I am
delighted for the mother and daughter.''
   For Beatrice's birth, the duchess was admitted shortly after 10
a.m. and gave birth at 8:18 p.m.
   No name was announced immediately for the new baby, but she will
be known as Her Royal Highness, Princess (baby's name) of York.
   Andrew's elder brother Prince Charles, 41, is first in line to
the throne, followed by his sons Prince William and Prince Harry of
Wales. Then comes Andrew, 30, then Beatrice.
   The queen's unmarried youngest son, Edward, 26, is now seventh
in line of succession. Her 39-year-old daughter Anne, the Princess
Royal, is eighth and has a son and daughter, Peter and Zara, who
are ninth and tenth.
   The duke's ship has returned to Britain after exercises and is
to remain in home waters until July. The queen went to Windsor
Castle, 21 miles west of London, for the weekend and has been
notified of the birth.

   U.S. diplomats were ordered out of Lithuania
by the Soviet Union on Friday, the White House said, as President
Bush cautioned the Soviets that using force against the breakaway
republic would be ``bound to backfire.''
   U.S. officials said other foreign diplomats and some journalists
also had been told to leave the Lithuanian capital.
   Bush declared that the United States stands with ``the brave men
and women of Lithuania'' in their struggle for self-determination.
   And, in his strongest words yet on the situation, he said, ``Any
attempt to coerce or intimidate or forcibly intervene against the
Lithuanian people is bound to backfire. That is inevitable.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United States
would comply with the order for its two diplomats to leave but
would formally protest to the Soviet Union. ``This action certainly
adds to our concerns,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The situation appears to progressively get worse,'' he said.
   Indeed, late in the day the Soviets' Tass news agency said the
situation was approaching ``anarchy in all its manifestations,''
the sort of language that in the past has been used to prepare
Soviets for major actions.
   The U.S. diplomats, Douglas Wake and Jon Purnell, said Friday
night in Vilnius that they had heard nothing about the order for
them to leave.
   Fitzwater said the diplomats, both State Department foreign
service officers, were in Lithuania only temporarily in any case.
They were returning to the U.S. consulate in Leningrad.
   The spokesman said, ``It is unclear what specific actions have
been taken against journalists. But we are opposed to any
infringements on freedom of the press.''
   Other U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said other foreign diplomats and journalists had been ordered out
of Lithuania.
   Fitzwater said the ``deputies committee'' of high-ranking
officials of the Pentagon, State Department, CIA and other agencies
was keeping track of developments in Lithuania, but ``It's not
being treated in a crisis-like way from our standpoint.''
   U.S. options, beyond appeals for a peaceful settlement, are
limited, and the administration wants to ``keep the rhetoric
down,'' Fitzwater said.
   Meanwhile, Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin said after a
meeting with Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger that he
had no information from Moscow about the expulsions.
   He indicated that Eagleburger raised the issue but that the
problem generally was being handled by the Soviet Foreign Ministry
and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. His meeting with Eagleburger had
been arranged before the expulsion order became known.
   Earlier, Bush said at a luncheon meeting with out-of-town news
media representatives, ``We know that the Soviet Union has a
longstanding interest in Lithuania, but those interests can only be
addressed through dialogue and negotiation.''
   With tensions steadily escalating, Bush said, ``We have made
clear to the Soviet Union that the situation in Lithuania can only
be solved peacefully.''
   Fitzwater said the two U.S. diplomats had arrived in Vilnius,
the Lithuanian capital, only Tuesday and had planned to leave on
Sunday.
   They were given 12 hours to leave, and ``they will comply,'' he
said.
   Fitzwater said that the United States was not given a reason by
Moscow for the expulsion. He said that the Soviet chief of protocol
relayed the expulsion notice to officials at the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow.
   He said the two officials were in Vilnius ``on routine reporting
and analysis as they do for the embassy.''
   ``They are staff people in our consulate in Leningrad,'' he
said. ``They're not spies,'' he added.
   Word of the Soviet action came shortly after Bush took questions
at the White House from the out-of-town reporters and editors. The
president later flew by helicopter to the presidential retreat in
Camp David, Md., where he was to spend the weekend.
   Fitzwater said that Bush was informed of the Soviet action
shortly before he left the White House.
   Fitzwater said that the United States ``has not acted in any way
to exacerbate tensions'' in Lithuania.
   On reports that journalists had been expelled, the White House
spokesman said: ``he expulsion of journalists undermines the spirit
of glasnost.''
   Bush's words came a day after he had declined to specifically
criticize Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for his order to
Lithuanians to surrender all firearms.
   On Thursday, Bush had appealed to Lithuanians to recognize
``certain realities'' of Soviet control. But, with Soviet armor
rumbling through the streets of the Lithuanian capital and other
evidence of an intensified crackdown by the Kremlin, the president
on Friday appeared to toughen his message.
   ``The brave men and women of Lithuania have made known their
desire to reestablish the sovereignty of the Republic of Lithuania.
The United States stands with them and supports their right to
self-determination,'' Bush said.
   He said the situation was ``complex and sensitive'' and required
``realistic, level-headed leadership'' on both sides.
   ``Lithuanian leaders have consistently demonstrated their
capacity in this regard, and the United States will do nothing that
will make their task more difficult,'' Bush said.
   In the same vein as Bush, Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a Los Angles appearance Soviet use
of force would be a ``major setback,'' and said Soviet intentions
were unknown.

   Soldiers patrolled the capital Friday
and three political parties sought to delay May's national
elections following riots sparked by the assassination of a leftist
presidential candidate.
   Also Friday, Pablo Escobar, the billionaire godfather of
Colombia's cocaine traffickers, denied government accusations he
was ordered the killing Thursday of the candidate, Bernardo
Jaramillo of the Patriotic Union Party. However, an army general
dismissed the denial as nonsense.
   The president of the Patriotic Union, Diego Montana, said in a
televised interview Friday on the midday news program Cinevision
that his party was withdrawing from the presidential elections.
   The Patriotic Union, Conservative and Communist parties all
asked the governing Liberal Party of President Virgilio Barco to
postpone the May 27 general elections, saying they feared for the
safety of the candidates.
   A telephone caller who claimed the assassination for the
Medellin cocaine cartel said the drug traffickers were renewing
their war with the government. They had said Jan. 18 they were
defeated and appealed for an end to extraditing suspects to the
United States.
   The caller also said Cesar Gaviria, the Liberal Party
presidential candidate, would be the next victim.
   Meanwhile in the southern city of Pasto, members of the
Patriotic Union held Mayor German Guerrero and an undetermined
number of city councilmen at the city hall, police there said in a
communique. There were few details, but no violence was reported.
   The disorder began when Jaramillo was mowed down with a burst of
submachine gun fire in Bogota's international airport Thursday. The
alleged gunman, 16, was wounded and captured, but three other
attackers reportedly escaped.
   Shortly after the killing, protesters took to streets, and
unrest continued into the predawn hours Friday in some poorer
neighborhoods of the capital.
   Bursts of submachine gun fire from snipers in one neighborhood
killed a soldier, the army said in a statement. It also reported
four policemen and a civilian were wounded.
   In addition, five buses were burned, army Gen. Ramon Niebles
said in a communique. Rioters smashed windows at dozens of stores.
   Police on Friday cleared streets of roadblocks made from the
burned vehicles, burning tires and other debris.
   Soldiers in armored cars with 20mm cannons patrolled the streets
of Bogota. They also rode in jeeps and armored personnel carriers
mounted with machine guns.
   Schools were closed Friday.
   In the central Colombia city of Barrancabermeja, the site of
Colombia's main oil refinery, workers of the state oil company
Ecopetrol reacted to the assassination by staging a 48-hour walkout
beginning Thursday afternoon.
   Another 48-hour strike was declared in the northwestern
banana-growing region of Uraba, where Jaramillo got his start in
politics.
   In the western city of Pereira in Colombia's coffee-growing
region, members of the Patriotic Union mounted a sit-in at the
federal attorney general's office.
   Right-wing death squads have been blamed for previous slayings
of Patriotic Union members. In the past, the Patriotic Union has
claimed that Colombia's army and police are involved in the death
squads.
   On Friday, the National Security Council reaffirmed that
Escobar, head of the Medellin cartel, had ordered Jaramillo's
assassination. A communique from the council said security forces
had monitored a telephone call in which Escobar ordered the
assassination and authorized $750 be paid for the job.
   The killer, a teen-ager who said he was hired in Medellin to
kill Jaramillo, was wounded and captured, but investigators said he
would not talk about who hired him.
   On Friday, Escobar sent a letter by fax to Colombian news media
denying his complicity.
   But army Gen. Harold Bedoya said the army's proof leaves no
doubt that Escobar ordered the killing.

   Alaska's governor and the commander of
the U.S. Coast Guard disagreed Friday over how much environmental
damage remains in Prince William Sound on the anniversary of the
nation's worst oil spill.
   ``There is a lot of cleanup work left to do this summer,'' Gov.
Steve Cowper told reporters at a news conference.
   ``The indications are that there is biological damage. We hope
it isn't long-term,'' Cowper said after a visit Thursday to shores
blackened when the Exxon Valdez ran aground spilling nearly 11
million gallons of crude oil.
   Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Yost, who also revisited Prince
William Sound this week _ almost a year after the March 24, 1989
spill _ disputed the governor's generally negative portrayal in
another news conference 90 minutes later.
   ``There is a tremendous improvement in the situation,'' Yost
said.
   Cowper released state Department of Environmental Conservation
preliminary data indicating dramatic biological impacts on salmon
and herring fisheries in some streams that enter the sound.
   He said major measures may be required in this summer's
oil-spill cleanup program to save the fisheries and other
resources. Exxon is proposing a cleanup plan that the state
considers inadequate.
   At one heavily polluted site, a normally rich salmon stream on
Latouche Island, ``not a single small salmon exists this spring,''
Cowper said. Though results of the state data are not definitive,
he said, ``it indicates that the oil in the substrata killed
whatever was there.''
   The governor also said 90 percent of herring roe at another site
have shown aberrations.
   Cowper also called on Exxon to settle out-of-court all valid
spill-related lawsuits with the federal government, the state and
private parties. If that is not done, he envisions up to a dozen
years of litigation, he said.
   Yost said he doubts the existence of state biological data
mentioned by Cowper. He said if the state is holding ``secret''
data it should released it immediately.
   The Coast Guard chief he learned from his visit to four heavily
oiled shorelines this week that a cleanup is still needed, but said
Exxon's 1989 efforts and the effects of winter storms and wave
action had made a ``major, major difference.''
   Yost said a ``fairly major'' cleanup effort will begin May 1
after the Coast Guard determines on a ``mile-by-mile basis'' the
proper kind of treatment that will be required this year.
   In a separate letter to the Coast Guard's on-scene coordinator,
Rear Adm. David Ciancaglini, released Friday by Cowper, Alaska DEC
Commissioner Dennis Kelso criticized Exxon's general plan for
1990's cleanup effort.
   Exxon, which released the plan on March 15, contended that last
year's heavy equipment-aided cleanup, followed by winter tides,
allows the company to use milder cleanup techniques this year.
   But the state said Friday the plan is ``far too limiting.''
   ``We cannot afford to base our work plan and our standards on
unsupported conclusions, public relations strategies, and solely
short-term `fixes,''' Kelso wrote.
   Cowper said the state will support more intrusive cleaning
techniques _ including such unproven tactics as bulldozing
shorelines _ if they are proven effective and allow micro-organisms
and other life forms to re-establish themselves over the long term.
   Yost said the federal on-scene coordinator will make the final
decisions on future cleanup activities and Exxon officials have
assured him the company will do everything ``reasonable'' it is
asked to do.
   Economics also will be a factor in determining what can be done,
Yost said. ``I don't think you can require anybody to spend an
unlimited amount of money,'' he said.

   The loincloths painted on some nude figures
in Michelangelo's ``Last Judgment'' on orders of Pope Pius IV
should be left on the 16th-century masterpiece, Vatican restorer
Fabrizio Mancinelli said Friday.
   ``To remove them, we would have to make a hole in the wall, and
frankly I don't want to make a hole in the wall,'' said Mancinelli,
who is directing the cleaning of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel
frescoes.
   The ``Last Judgment'' is a 60-by-30-foot painting on the wall
above the chapel altar.
   Mancinelli spoke at a news conference presenting a Vatican
exhibit on Michelangelo and the 11-year-old project of wiping away
centuries of soot, grime and dust from the Renaissance work.
   The Sistine Chapel restoration has long been surrounded by
controversy. Critics, led by Columbia University art historian
James Beck, charged the restorers were removing some of
Michelangelo's retouchings and altering the colors of the frescoes.
   But Mancinelli said the Vatican team left Michelangelo's
original work intact, removing only glue-varnish added to the
painting by 17th and 18th century restorers.
   Restorers recently finished cleaning the 5,533-square-foot
vaulted chapel ceiling, revealing bright and dynamic colors. Early
next month, they will begin the four-year restoration of the ``Last
Judgment.''
   Some 16th-century church officials were shocked by the nude
figures in the ``Last Judgment,'' and in 1564, Pius IV ordered
those found most offensive to be covered up by artist Daniele da
Volterra.
   Some art experts argue the loincloths should now be removed, but
Mancinelli said the rules of Italian restoration call for all
essential elements of an artwork to be maintained, including da
Volterra's reworkings.
   He noted previously that the whole issue may be moot, since some
historians think the nude parts were removed when da Volterra made
his additions. If they are correct, taking away the loincloths
would reveal bare spots on the wall.
   The issue is expected to be debated by 50 international
scientists, restorers and art historians meeting at the Vatican
next week to discuss plans for the ``Last Judgment'' restoration.
   Carlo Pietrangeli, director of the Vatican Museums, said the
results of the ceiling restoration had eliminated the bitterness he
felt over the ``unjustified criticism'' of the project.
   There has been talk of limiting the number of tourists in the
chapel, which on peak days can attract up to 19,000 visitors. But
Pietrangeli said it would be ``practically impossible'' to turn
back tourists.
   Pope John Paul II is scheduled to inaugurate the Michelangelo
exhibit on Saturday in the Braccio di Carlo Magno in St. Peter's
Square. Entitled ``Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel _ Technique,
Conservation and Myth,'' the exhibit will open to the public Sunday
and run through July 10.
   The exhibit includes a selection of Michelangelo's drawings
showing how he planned the Sistine Chapel decoration; a scale model
of the scaffolding he used; a video on the cleaning techniques; and
drawings by Raphael, Rubens, Caravaggio and others underlining
Michelangelo's impact on other artists.

   Former Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph
Hazelwood was sentenced Friday to help clean up Prince William
Sound and pay $50,000 in restitution by a judge seeking to soothe
outrage over the nation's worst oil spill.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone, in sentencing Hazelwood to
1,000 hours of community service by cleaning beaches, said he was
disappointed that the fired skipper had not publicly apologized for
his role in the disaster.
   ``I'm sure deep down he is very shameful,'' the judge said.
Johnstone, however, acknowledged that Hazelwood had been advised by
his lawyers to keep silent because of the many civil lawsuits he
still faces.
   Hazelwood's attorneys said they thought the sentence for a
single misdemeanor conviction of negligence would be overturned on
appeal, in part because the order to pay $50,000 in restitution to
the state was illegal.
   The defense attorneys said Johnstone chose an arbitrary figure
without measuring Hazelwood's ability to pay.
   The judge also gave Hazelwood the maximum jail term of 90 days
and fine of $1,000, but suspended both sentences, saying he felt
prison would not deter Hazelwood.
   ``Imprisonment is not going to restore the environment,'' the
judge said. ``But there is community outrage and something has to
be done to provide condemnation and reaffirmation.''
   Johnstone, who presided over Hazelwood's seven-week trial, said
he felt the captain was wrong to drink before he boarded his ship
and believed he violated at least some Coast Guard regulations in
the grounding a year ago Saturday.
   A 12-member jury found Hazelwood guilty Thursday of a charge of
negligent discharge of oil into state waters. But he was acquitted
of three other charges, including a felony, that he was reckless
and drunk during the disaster that blackened the rocky shoreline of
Prince William Sound.
   Had he been convicted of all four, Hazelwood could have received
a maximum 7\ years and a $61,000 fine.
   Hazelwood's lawyers said they would appeal the conviction as
well as the sentence, and Johnstone said he would stay the sentence
as soon as that appeal is filed.
   One of Hazelwood's lawyers later issued a statement accusing the
judge of ``Hazelwood bashing'' and said Johnstone's criticism of
the skipper for drinking and being off the bridge of his ship
improperly tried to override the jury's verdict.
   ``In light of the jury verdict this type of demagoguery should
stop,'' said attorney Thomas Russo.
   He said 90 percent of Johnstone's comments Friday were directed
at what the jury already had decided, absolving Hazelwood of
recklessness and intoxication.
   Another Hazelwood attorney, Dick Madson, told reporters after
the sentencing, ``The restitution is illegal, I think. The judge
has no right to set an arbitrary figure like that.''
   Madson said that in almost any crime a judge can assess a figure
for restitution, an amount that goes to the victim rather than to
the state as would a normal fine.
   He said, however, such an assessment always involves measuring
the defendant's ability to pay and degree of responsibility.
Johnstone made no such inquiry, and the Madson asserted this would
invalidate the the assessment.
   Madson called the order to perform community service ``a novel
way to come up with a fair sentence,'' but he and another Hazelwood
attorney, Michael Chalos, said they thought the 1,000 hours were
excessive since the sentence would exceed the maximum 90 days in
jail allowed under the law.
   Even if Hazelwood worked 8 hours a day cleaning beaches, they
said, he could not finish 1,000 hours within 3 months.
   The judge's decision also meet with the disapproval of the jury
forewoman, Lori Wing, who was in the courtroom along with four
other jurors for the sentencing.
   ``I had high hopes he would walk out of here a free man and get
on with his life,'' she said.
   Hazelwood had no immediate comment on the sentencing. Madson
said Hazelwood had come to court expecting the worst: jail time.
After Thursday's verdict, Hazelwood had commented, ``I'd like to go
back to the sea. That's what I do.''
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole, in remarks before the
sentencing, cited Hazelwood's history of two drunken driving
convictions and declared that ``Captain Hazelwood is probably, on a
scale of 1 to 10, a 3 or 4 as to his likelihood of rehabilitation.''
   The skipper's future also is clouded by more than 100 lawsuits
filed by assorted victims of the spill.
   The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, ran aground on March 24,
1989, and gushed nearly 11 million gallons of oil into the pristine
sound.
   It killed countless birds, fish and wildlife in the scenic area,
and Exxon came under bitter criticism for failing to respond
quickly with a clean up effort.
   Hazelwood was charged last year with a felony, criminal
mischief, and three misdemeanors, reckless endangerment, operating
a vessel while intoxicated, and negligent discharge of oil. Jurors
took only 10{ hours in deliberations to reject all but one count.
   Two of them said afterward that they rejected the state's
contention Hazelwood was impaired by alcohol when the ship grounded
because blood alcohol tests were performed on the skipper 10{ hours
after the tanker hit the reef.
   In his ruling, however, Johnstone condemned Hazelwood: ``I think
Captain Hazelwood knows that no reasonably prudent person would
have had those drinks or left the bridge. In my opinion, he
violated at least a couple of Coast Guard regulations and that
constitutes negligence.
   ``I think Captain Hazelwood knows the buck stops with him and he
has to take responsibility,'' the judge said.
   But Jim Morakis, an Exxon spokesman in New York, said Thursday
that the verdict ``would seem to confirm the view that the
grounding of the Exxon Valdez was an accident.''
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper said Hazelwood's acquittal on the most
serious charges shows that someone other than the veteran mariner
was responsible for the grounding.
   ``The result bears out the fact that there are other people
responsible for this, other than Captain Hazelwood,'' said Cowper.

   A U.S. judge in Guam on Friday blocked the territory's new
abortion law, the nation's most restrictive, and a legislative
package that would let Maryland voters decide the abortion issue
lost a vote and appeared doomed.
   In Idaho, more than 50 junior high school students staged a
brief sit-in in the office of Gov. Cecil Andrus, protesting the
Legislature's passage of a law that would ban more than 90 percent
of the abortions performed in the state.
   They demanded that the governor veto the legislation, which was
approved Thursday and is the most restrictive abortion measure
passed by any state legislature.
   Pro-choice interests in California, Michigan, Wisconsin, Rhode
Island and North Carolina have threatened to boycott Idaho potatoes
if Andrus fails to veto the bill.
   ``Women can fight back,'' said Anne Nicol Gaylor, administrator
of the Madison based-Women's Medical Fund Inc., based in Madison,
Wis. ``We do not have to beg and plead for our rights any more.''
   Either the Guam law or the Idaho law could provide the basis for
a direct challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe
vs. Wade decision that legalized abortions.
   The Maryland Senate early Friday approved and sent to the House
of Delegates a complicated compromise to end an eight-day
filibuster on the abortion issue.
   But the House Environmental Matters Committee voted 13 to 12
against the package Friday night.
   There had been a possibility that an attempt to revive the
proposal would be made on the House floor, but because of House
Democratic leadership opposition, the committee action most likely
ends the matter for the 1990 session.
   John S. Arnick, chairman of Environmental Matters, told that
panel before he cast the tie-breaking vote that the leadership's
recommendation was to defeat both bills ``for the sake of the
system.'' He said the compromise involved a ``convoluted system
that doesn't make sense in a lot of ways'' and warned that ``the
public would be cursed with confusion.''
   Under the compromise, an abortion rights bill permitting
unrestricted abortions during the early stages of pregnancy would
have become law. Voters would have been able to call a referendum
on the law in November through a petition drive.
   If voters then rejected it in the referendum, then a bill
sponsored by anti-abortion senators would have become law _ unless
it also was defeated by voters. That bill would have allowed
abortions in cases of rape or incest, to protect the mother's life
or if the pregnancy would produce serious and adverse effects on
the woman's health.
   The compromise required that both measures be passed by the
House and signed by the governor. If one of the measures was
rejected, the other one aldo would have died, but the committee
vote made all that moot.
   In Agana, Guam, U.S. District Judge Alex Munson issued a
temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of the territory's
new law, a few hours after a group of Guam residents and medical
groups filed a class-action lawsuit. He scheduled a hearing for
Monday on whether to extend his order.
   The plaintiffs included ``Maria Doe,'' a Guam woman who is eight
weeks pregnant and wants an abortion, the Guam Society of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Guam Nurses Association, an
Episcopal priest and three doctors.
   Defendants include Gov. Joseph Ada, who signed the bill into law
Monday, and territorial Attorney General Elizabeth
Barrett-Anderson, who advised the Legislature that the bill was
unconstitutional before it was approved.
   Rachael Pine, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties
Union's Reproductive Freedom Project in New York, said the lawsuit
cites violation of constitutional guarantees of right to privacy,
due process, free speech, equal protection, guarantees of religious
freedoms and freedom from slavery.
   Guam's law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. It makes it a felony to perform abortion or
aid in the procedure, and a misdemeanor for a woman to solicit or
have an abortion, or for a person to solicit a woman to have an
abortion.
   The law provides for a referendum on the Nov. 6 ballot for Guam
voters to decide whether to retain or reject the law.
   Guam's law is more restrictive than the bill passed by the Idaho
Legislature.
   The Idaho bill would ban abortion except in cases of
non-statutory rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim
is younger than 18, severe fetal deformity or threat to the
mother's life or physical health. It would ban more than 90 percent
of the 1,500 abortions performed in Idaho annually.
   ``Idaho was one of the first states to give women their rights,
and now they want to take them away from us,'' said 15-year-old
Michele May, one of those protesting at the governor's office in
Boise. ``We can't let them do that.''
   If Andrus signs the bill, the law would take effect July 1, and
abortion rights groups have promised a quick court challenge. The
governor has not said what he would do.
   In Washington, D.C., Guam's congressional delegate worked to
head off retaliation from colleagues resulting from the abortion
law.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., sent a letter to colleagues
Thursday, urging them to withdraw support for a bill to provide
commonwealth status for Guam.
   ``States and territories may have the right to pass laws that
deny women the right to choice, but no government has the right to
deny its citizens freedom of speech,'' Miller's letter said.

   A state Senate compromise to end an
eight-day filibuster over an abortion rights bill was narrowly
rejected by a state House committee Friday night.
   Because of House leadership opposition, the action by the
Environmental Matters Committee most likely ends for the 1990
session an abortion debate that has dominated the deliberations of
the Maryland General Assembly for several weeks.
   The Senate approved the compromise earlier in the day, agreeing
to pass both a pro-choice bill and a more restrictive measure
favored by abortion opponents. Lawmakers expected that at least one
of the bills would be petitioned to a referendum, which would
essentially give voters the final say on the issue.
   Normally, Friday night's 13-to-12 vote by House Environmental
Matters would doom the compromise. However, there was at least a
possibility that an attempt to revive the proposal would be made on
the House floor, which was to meet later Friday night.
   Another possibility would be for a move from the floor to revive
the pro-choice bill only, approve it and pass it back to the
Senate, which would then have to deal with the abortion issue again.
   But the House Democratic leadership was opposed to any revival
attempt.
   John S. Arnick, chairman of Environmental Matters, told that
panel before he cast the tie-breaking vote that the leadership's
recommendation was to defeat both bills ``for the sake of the
system.''
   He said the compromise involved a ``convoluted system that
doesn't make sense in a lot of ways'' and warned that ``the public
would be cursed with confusion.''
   Under the compromise, an abortion rights bill permitting
unrestricted abortions during the early stages of pregnancy will
become law unless voters reject it in November. Voters must sign
petitions to get it on the ballot.
   If it is rejected, then a bill sponsored by anti-abortion
senators will become law _ unless it also is defeated by voters.
Under that bill, abortions could be performed in cases of rape or
incest, to protect the mother's life or if the pregnancy would
produce serious and adverse effects on the woman's health.
   Both measures would have to be passed by the House and signed by
the governor. If one of the measures is rejected, the other one
dies.

   Hydrogen gas building up in nuclear waste
storage tanks at the Hanford nuclear reservation could explode,
possibly spewing radioactivity into the atmosphere, the U.S.
Department of Energy warned Friday.
   The hydrogen buildup has been spotted in 20 storage tanks at
Hanford and is the result of the decomposition of organic wastes
introduced into the tanks in the 1970s, said Hanford manager Mike
Lawrence.
   The wastes, in the form of a slurry with a surface crust that
traps gases underneath, are byproducts of production of nuclear
weapons materials at Hanford.
   The chance of an explosion is low, Lawrence insisted Friday, but
added scientists do not know enough about the problem to rule it
out.
   ``We taken every precaution we can think of but I can't give you
an absolute guarantee,'' Lawrence told a hastily called news
conference.
   ``The worst case is any explosion that could cause the dome to
collapse and send the contents up to the air,'' he said. ``I can't
sit here and say it's not going to happen.''
   The tanks are built of 1{-foot-thick reinforced steel and
concrete and are buried under six to eight feet of dirt.
   There has never been a storage tank explosion at Hanford, but
nuclear waste storage tanks have apparently exploded in the Soviet
Union. A 1989 Tass report said 10,000 people were evacuated after a
1957 explosion. But other reports of the 1957 accident indicated
that hundreds had died.
   The Hanford danger came to light in a study performed by the
Westinghouse Hanford Co., main DOE contractor at the reservation.
The study was prompted by concerns raised by Congress late last
year about the possibility of ferrocyanide exploding in the tanks.
   Ferrocyanide was added to the liquid waste stream from 1954-1975
to concentrate the waste and produce additional storage space in
the tanks.
   While the ferrocyanide threat was ultimately ruled to be very
low, scientists discovered that hydrogen gas buildup in the tanks
was a greater danger than previously thought, Lawrence said.
   He said he first learned of the study's conclusions Thursday. No
copy of the study was immediately available.
   One of the newer, double-shell storage tanks is of particular
concern, Lawrence said. That million-gallon tank, known as 101-SY,
has seen its waste level rise and fall by as much as 33 inches
because of hydrogen gas buildup, he said.
   Hydrogen concentration in the tank has been measured at as much
as 5 percent at an exhaust vent and may have been higher elsewhere
in the tank, Lawrence said.
   A 5 percent hydrogen buildup is considered potentially
flammable, while an 18 percent buildup is considered potentially
explosive, he said.
   The waste rise was first noticed in 1977, and scientists since
1984 have tried various methods to reduce the tank's gas buildup,
including injecting water into the slurry and lancing the surface
crust with pipes to relieve pressure. None of those measures
worked, Lawrence said.
   Hanford workers have now stopped all transfers of waste in or
out of the tank and conduct no maintenance work that would create
heat or sparks in the area, he said.
   Lesser hydrogen buildup has also been spotted in four other
double-shell tanks, and in 15 of the older single-shell storage
tanks, he said.
   In addition to hydrogen, the decomposition of the organic wastes
is producing nitrous oxides and nitrogen, with the combination of
gases increasing the risk, DOE said.
   Scientists will not have a plan for dealing with the problem
until June, Lawrence said, but added the explosion danger is not
imminent and precautions are being taken.
   The storage tanks contain a mixture of wastes. The organics were
added in the 1970s when they were used as solvents to recover
radioactive strontium from some of the taks, Lawrence said.
   While past analysis of the possiblity of a hydrogen explosion
has indicated that the giant tanks would remain intact and contain
their radioactivity, Lawrence stressed that Hanford scientists will
conduct new studies because they feel the new danger is greater
than that previously analyzed.
   Westinghouse scientists are seeking outside help from industry
experts with experience in fire and explosion prevention, DOE said.
   The ferrocyanide investigations were prompted by Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, who last year released a 1984 report raising the
possibility of explosions in the tanks.

   Snow fell from the Northwest across the Plains on Friday while
cold air pushed southward, stirring up a tornado in Utah and
dumping a foot of snow on Montana, but temperatures hit record
highs in Arizona and Connecticut.
   At midday, snow was falling across north-central Oregon,
south-central Washington state, the Idaho Panhandle, north-central
Utah, Wyoming, Montana, northern Colorado, southern and western
Nebraska, western South Dakota, northern Kansas, southwestern Iowa,
northern and west-central Missouri, and west-central Illinois, the
National Weather Service said.
   Southern Montana suffered the worst of the storm, with Red Lodge
reporting 12 inches of snow. Morning temperatures were no higher
than the mid-teens. Billings had a record low of just 7 degrees and
Jordan had a morning low of just 1 degree.
   Northerly wind gusting to 30 mph produced a wind chill effect of
32 below zero at Dillon, Mont.
   Northern Missouri got 5 inches of snow Friday, with several more
inches forecast for Saturday. One traffic death was blamed on
hazardous driving conditions, which also prompted officials to
close some rural schools.
   ``We had literally hundreds of cars off the road and lots and
lots of fender-benders,'' said Missouri highway patrol Sgt. Myron
Garrett at St. Joseph.
   Almost 2 inches of snow overnight and freezing temperatures
created hazardous driving conditions on many roads around Spokane,
Wash., and state police reported many minor accidents
   The heaviest snowfall during the six hours up to noon was 3
inches at Norfolk, Neb., and 2 inches at Cheyenne, Wyo.; Helena,
Mont.; Lincoln, Neb., and Walla Walla, Wash.
   Winter-like weather was expected to force its way as far south
as Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, with gusty wind pushing
temperatures 30 to 40 degrees lower than those of the past several
days.
   To the east, snow was scattered around the Great Lakes and in
parts of Vermont and New Hampshire.
   South of the snow belt, freezing rain extended over northwestern
Oklahoma, the northern Texas Panhandle, southwestern and central
Kansas, and southeastern through east-central Colorado.
   The collision of the cold air with warm air produced
thunderstorms Friday over Utah and a rare tornado ripped off a
storage shed roof near Vernal, in northeastern Utah, and slammed it
through a bedroom wall.
   ``When it hit our trailer, it felt like an earthquake had hit,''
said Tina Harrison, whose mobile home was damaged by the twister.
``We were waiting for it to knock our trailer off its cinder
blocks. It was scary.''
   Showers and thunderstorms also reached from north-central and
southwestern Oklahoma, the southern Texas Panhandle and
northeastern New Mexico.
   Thunderstorms produced half-inch diameter hail south of Guthrie,
Okla.
   Weather was warmer east and west of the advancing cold wave.
Bridgeport, Conn., hit a record high of 68 and Tucson, Ariz., hit a
record high of 91.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 7 above
zero at Butte and Livingston, Mont., to 93 at Palm Springs, Calif.
   Friday's low for the Lower 48 states was 3 below zero at
International Falls, Minn.

   A compromise has been worked out to avert

Christians over an attempt to arrest the Central Bank governor,
Prime Minister Salim Hoss said Thursday.
   His statement came after President Elias Hrawi's office said
Interior Minister Elias Khazen offered his letter of resignation
late Wednesday.
   ``The president decided to keep the letter of resignation,''
Hrawi's office said, without specifying if Khazen would remain in
the post.
   A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the president's neither accepting or rejecting the resignation was
``a face-saving exit'' for both Khazen and Hoss.
   ``Any other decision would have toppled the government. Had
Khazen's resignation been accepted, several ministers would have
resigned in solidarity with him. Had it been rejected, Hoss would
have resigned,'' he explained.
   Hoss demanded the resignation after Khazen sent police to arrest
bank governor Edmond Naim on March 15.
   Central Bank guards foiled the attempt, though a bank
administrator suffered a minor wound in the brief shootout.
   Hours after the compromise was worked out Wednesday, the Central
Bank announced it has approved the payment of $1.5 million to the
London-based company, Thomas de la Rue, for printing 1 million
Lebanese passports.
   The Central Bank's original refusal to finance the deal on the
ground it received an offer from a Swedish company to do the job at
half the price prompted Khazen's attempt to arrest Naim. The fate
of the Swedish deal was not disclosed.
   Also Thursday, Hoss instructed the foreign, interior and defense
ministries to check out thoroughly reports about Israeli settlement
activities in south Lebanon.
   Salah Staitieh, chief of the Foreign Ministry's political
department, said ``a diplomatic effort will be launched if it was
confirmed that the enemy's troops were building roads or annexing
Lebanese territory.''
   Israeli troops and allied militiamen control a 6-to-10-mile-deep
strip of territory in south Lebanon.
   Christian militia chieftain Samir Geagea on Thursday meanwhile
repeated a cautious welcome for an Arab League-brokered peace plan
to end Lebanon's civil war.
   Geagea's rival, Gen. Michel Aoun, has rejected the accord along
with Hrawi's election as president Nov. 24. Almost 800 people have
died in fighting between Aoun's soldiers and Geagea's militiamen
since Jan. 30.
   Hrawi, Geagea and Aoun are Maronites, the Catholic community
that has dominated Lebanon since independence from France in 1943.

   Federal regulators on Friday declared safe a
genetically engineered enzyme they said was identical to the
naturally occurring substance _ the same stuff that made Little
Miss Muffet's curds and whey.
   The Food and Drug Administration said it received no objections
to the addition of bacterially produced chymosin, the active
ingredient in rennet, to its list of foods ``generally recognized
as safe.''
   The only two objections received by the agency raised the
question of whether the dairy industry needed additional sources of
rennet, a question the agency said was irrelevant to the safety
issue and one it could not consider, FDA said in a notice published
in the Federal Register.
   Rennet makes milk clot and forms curds and whey, and is used to
make cheese and other dairy products.
   It is derived from the fourth stomach of calves, kids or lambs
as a solution of prochymosin, and treated with acid to break down
the prochymosin into chymosin, the active ingredient in rennet.
Chymosin is sometimes called rennin.
   The pharmaceutical firm Pfizer Inc. petitioned FDA two years ago
to approve its manufactured chymosin as ``generally recognized as
safe,'' or alternatively to approve it as a food additive. The food
additive petition was withdrawn Friday when the safety petition was
approved.
   Pfizer uses the K-12 laboratory strain of Escherichia coli, a
common human intestinal bacterium, to make the chymosin. The K-12
strain has lost the ability to live in humans.
   The gene that directs the manufacture of prochymosin is inserted
into the bacterial genes, and works there instead of in the animal.
   The prochymosin solution that results will have different
impurities, but the agency said Pfizer had shown those impurities
``do not provide any basis for concern.''

<HEAD>Agency Disputes Senate Panel's Findings on Alleged Oil Theft From
Indians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal Bureau of Land Management is
disputing a Senate subcommittee's finding that the nation's largest
independent oil producer stole more than $30 million worth of crude
oil from Indian lands.
   The agency said it took independent measurements on oil
shipments from one-quarter of the 917 Indian land leases involving
Koch Industries Inc. across the country and found just three minor
discrepancies. The company had been accused of deliberate
mismeasurements to avoid paying royalties.
   In a report published Wednesday, the agency said it carried out
460 inspections on leases and lease agreements involving Koch
Industries both before and after the May 1989 hearings by the
Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs.
   On another 42 randomly selected leases, the bureau compared
purchaser and producer measurement records with the production
figures reported to the federal government, and no discrepancies
were found, the report said.
   And on Monday, the Osage Tribal Council said it completed a
review of Koch Industries Inc. purchases in Osage County, Okla.,
for 1987, 1988 and the first five months of 1989 and found that
``overpayment of royalties by Koch were made as well as
underpayments.''
   The net amount owed was about $22,000, plus $7,057 in late
penalties, the council said.
   During that period, Koch Industries bought 10 million barrels of
Osage oil and paid $33 million in royalties for it, it said. The
discrepancy amounted to less than one-tenth of 1 percent.
   Koch Industries's executive vice president for legal and
corporate affairs, Donald L. Cordes, said both investigations were
``in marked contrast to the shallow, selective and biased
investigations reported to the Senate subcommittee in the
sensationalized hearings of last spring.''
   Two former Koch employees told the subcommittee they were
pressured to steal oil from wells on Indian land. The company
expected them to mismeasure oil from the wells so that Koch did not
have to pay for all it got, they testified.
   The company rebutted the allegations, saying the subcommittee's
figures were inaccurate.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who was chairman of the
subcommittee, was not available for comment Thursday, a secretary
in his office said.
   Koch officials maintained from the start of the controversy that
factors such as temperature, crude oil composition and holding tank
conditions make precise measurement of crude impossible.
   The company also suggested an ongoing Koch family feud might
have led to the subcommittee's findings.
   The subcommittee heard testimony from an investigator hired by
William Koch, the son of the company's founder. Koch sold his
interest in Koch Industries in 1982 as part of the out-of-court
settlement of a lawsuit in which he and others attempted to gain
control of the company. His brother, Charles Koch, is Koch
Industries' board chairman.
   Koch Industries, based in Wichita, has interests in energy, real
estate, manufacturing and cattle. It is one of the nation's largest
privately held corporations with annual revenues estimated at
$16-18 billion, and employs more than 7,000.

   African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela
has offered to hold high-level talks with Britain, the Foreign
Office said Thursday.
   It said Mandela made the proposal when he met Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd at an independence banquet Wednesday night in
Windhoek, Namibia.
   Mandela offered to meet Hurd for talks Thursday, but Hurd had to
return to Britain, the Foreign Office said.
   It said no mention was made of a possible meeting with Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, who invited Mandela for talks when his
27-year imprisonment ended last month.
   Mandela is to visit London at Easter for an international rock
concert and rally celebrating his freedom.
   The ANC disagrees with Britain's call for easing sanctions
against South Africa following Mandela's release, and critics of
Mrs. Thatcher claimed Mandela was signaling his displeasure by not
replying to her invitation.

<TEXT>
   A handwritten 1918 letter from Russian
revolutionary Leon Trotsky to V.I. Lenin was auctioned Thursday for
$27,500, an ``extreme bargain'' in the view of the buyer, a
California book dealer.
   But an original manuscript of drawings and writings by the late
actor Orson Welles failed to draw a bid after being offered for
$11,000 at the Swann Galleries auction.
   Louis Weinstein, owner of the Heritage Bookshop Inc. of Los
Angeles, bought the one-page Trotsky letter, and said he planned to
offer it for resale at a New York book fair this weekend.
   ``It was very cheap. I expected it would go for $60,000 to
$70,000,'' he said.
   The letter, addressed to ``Dear Vladimir Ilyich,'' is considered
historically significant because it outlined Trotsky's own plan for
a ``no war, no peace'' settlement with the so-called Central
Powers, led by Germany, near the end of World War I. It was also
intended for Lenin's cohort, Josef Stalin.
   The day's most successful bid was $57,750 for a 1663 collection
of William Shakespeare's ``Comedies, Histories and Tragedies,'' a
price nearly three times the initial bid of $20,000.
   Caroline Birenbaum, a spokeswoman for the gallery, said the
buyer, who bid by telephone, wanted to remain anonymous.
   Neither the Trotsky letter nor the Welles manuscript had a
estimated price in the catalog, but it was evident that Swann
officials were disappointed at the response to the two highly
publicized items.
   However, George Lowry, the president and chief auctioneer of
Swann Galleries, disagreed with Weinstein's estimate on the letter.
``We figured it at between $20,000 and $30,000 and it came in right
in the middle,'' he said.
   Lowry said he thought the Welles material was ``the victim of
its own advance publicity.'' Several prospective buyers were on the
telephone but did not bid, and others evidently could not get
through, Lowry said.
   Birenbaum said later that ``several expressions of interest''
had been received after the auction for the Welles manuscript, a
68-page collection of sketches and written text done by the actor
in 1956 as a gift to his daughter, Rebecca, who consigned it for
sale.
   It deals with the Bravades, a three-day festival held each year
at the French resort city of St. Tropez.
   The Trotsky letter, written during the turbulent period just
after the abdication of Czar Nicholas II and the seizure of power
by the Bolsheviks, has been quoted in previous writings on the
period but had not itself been available to scholars of the Russian
Revolution.
   It was offered for sale from the estate of Adele Bernstein of
Binghamton, the daughter-in-law of Herman Bernstein, a noted
American foreign correspondent who obtained the letter in Russia.
   In the letter, Trotsky outlined his views of what Russia's
position should be in regard to German demands that it withdraw
from the allied side in the war.
   ``It is impossible to sign their peace,'' Trotsky wrote, adding
that he would propose instead an end to Russian involvement without
signing any agreement. This ``no war, no peace'' position has been
likened to the Cold War following World War II.
   In fact he took that stance as head of the Russian delegation at
Brest-Litovsk a month later, a strategy that backfired by allowing
the Germans to drive farther into Russia. The Russians were forced
to sign a less advantageous treaty, but were saved by Germany's
eventual defeat.

   The government said Thursday it is
lifting bans on two newspapers and a Roman Catholic radio station
that had been accused of reporting false information.
   President Samuel Doe decided to remove the ban Wednesday in
honor of Namibia's independence that day, according to a Ministry
of Information statement. The southern African nation became
independent after 75 years of white South African rule.
   Footprints Today and Sun Times newspapers were banned in April
1988, when the government also barred radio stations from
broadcasting reports of the British Broadcasting Corp. and the
U.S.-funded Voice of America.
   Footprints Today was accused of fabricating a letter to the
editor signed by an alleged army officer who said secret killings
and arrests were increasing in Liberia.
   Offending stories in the Sun Times reported the arrest of a
Ghanaian for possession of explosives and the firing of the
commander of a government anti-terrorist squad.
   ELCM community radio was ordered closed in June 1989 for
reporting one person was crushed to death and hundreds were injured
in a stampede at a Monrovia football stadium where Liberia lost to
Malawi.
   The independent press of this West African nation, which was
founded by freed American slaves in 1847, expressed anger Saturday
over the burning down of the independent Daily Observer newspaper
building.
   Four armed men in military uniforms reportedly doused the
library, darkroom and newsroom with gasoline, then set them ablaze.
   Newspaper editors said the act was intended to intimidate them.
   Also last week, the managing director of the Independent News,
Klon Hinneh, was detained for several days under a court order for
printing Chief Justice Emmanuel Gbalazeh's picture on the back page
instead of the front page.

<HEAD>Radical Retirement Home Celebrates Victory Against Oblivion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of a retirement home for aging
political activists held a victory celebration Thursday, the day
they had faced a deadline for moving out of the stately,
Spanish-style mansion.
   The home's nine remaining residents applauded the resignations
of 10 board members who wanted to sell the home to a developer for
$1.2 million _ a deal originally set to close March 26 _ and the
appointment of a new board Tuesday.
   The residents and the new directors promised to press their
struggle to keep open Sunset Hall, which has been a home to
socialists, radicals, communists and liberal religious activists.
   ``It was a very joyous occasion in which we were able to declare
a total victory to our struggle,'' said Jan Goodman, the new board
president. ``We now have a new board totally dedicated to keeping
Sunset Hall open.''
   That won't be easy, she acknowledged. It costs $30,000 a month
to run the 36-bed facility, but the nine residents bring in only
about $7,200 a month. They pay between $900 and $1,400 a month,
although some are charged less because of need. The home has
$15,000 in reserve.
   The home has operated at a deficit for nearly 20 years, said
administrator Thomas E. Brandlin.
   Some longtime residents moved out after the old board announced
in July that it was going to sell.
   But other residents went to court earlier this month and
obtained a temporary injunction, a 20-day reprieve of the March 22
deadline for moving out.
   Residents claimed the board had failed to do enough to keep open
the home, which they call a special place to live, where lively
discussion, music and social activism remain a way of life.
   Then the 10 board members resigned after it became apparent they
would not be able to muster enough votes from members of the
non-profit group that runs Sunset Hall to approve the sale at an
April 1 meeting.
   Founded in 1924 by the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles,
Sunset Hall was intended for elderly religious liberals. The church
no longer runs it.
   Among the home's past residents have been Ruben Burroughs,
editor of socialist Uptoin Sinclair's newsletter during Sinclair's
1934 run for governor. Other residents helped with union causes in
the 1930s and fought McCarthy-era blacklisting in the 1950s.

   After Soviet armor rumbled through
Lithuania's capital, leaders of the breakaway republic issued a
worldwide appeal for support and expressed concern that increasing
Kremlin pressure would lead to violence.
   The appeal came Thursday, following the Red Army maneuvers
through Vilnius and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call on
Lithuania to stop signing up its own volunteer forces.
   A day earlier, Gorbachev told Lithuanian citizens to hand over
all their firearms within a week.
   The Kremlin has said it would not use force to bring Lithuania
back into the fold after its declaration of independence March 11.
But Lithuanian officials were afraid that an effort to round up
deserters might give Moscow such an excuse, said Algirdas
Saudargas, head of the Lithuanian Parliament's foreign affairs
committee.

   Flushed with a feeling of victory after
three acquittals and a conviction on a minor misdemeanor, Exxon
Valdez skipper Joseph Hazelwood says he longs to return to the sea
as a ship captain.
   His lawyer, Michael Chalos, said he will start negotiating with
Exxon to regain the skipper's job with the shipping company that
hired him out of college and fired him after his tanker grounded a
year ago, causing the nation's worst oil spill.
   ``I'd like to go back to the sea. That's what I do,'' Hazelwood
said Thursday after jurors absolved him of accusations he was
reckless and drunk during the disaster that blackened the rocky
shoreline of Prince William Sound.
   The misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil on which
Hazelwood was convicted carries a maximum sentence of 90 days in
jail and a $1,000 fine, far less than the 7\ years and $61,000 fine
he could have faced if found guilty on all four charges.

<DATELINE>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may have been the best-known
500 square yards of the Vietnam War: the Continental Hotel terrace,
where spies, soldiers and journalists met at sunset to swap tales
and numb the horror with drink.
   After years as a military headquarters and extensive remodeling,
the Continental and its ``Shelf,'' as the terrace was called, are
open again and catering to the business crowd.
   The Continental was built between 1910 and 1915, in the French
era, and initially welcomed a colonial cast of rubber planters and
Foreign Legionnaires.
   Then the Americans came to fight, and to spend their dollars on
the Shelf. Every night, they were ambushed by prostitutes, crippled
beggars, pickpockets and the doe-eyed urchins selling flowers, whom
hardly any could resist.
   That era ended in April 1975, when North Vietnamese tanks rolled
into Saigon.
   Saigon became Ho Chi Minh City. The French-owned Continental was
summarily nationalized, as was the Rex a block down the street,
where American officers lived and played.
   Vietnamese military officers occupied the Continental for 13
years while communist authorities tried to impose their will on the
free-wheeling southerners, with less than gratifying success.
   Six months ago, the Continental began its fourth life. After two
years of renovations, the hotel opened its 72 rooms to tourists and
the foreign businessmen who are flocking to economically
liberalized Vietnam.
   War and its traditional intrigues are gone from the Shelf. The
talk on the terrace these days is of investment opportunities,
cheap labor, bureaucratic snags and how to get around orthodox
communist functionaries.
   Military green and safari jackets are the stuff of ghosts,
replaced by the once-scorned jacket and tie.
   The rooms on the three floors above are occupied by company
executives and deal makers. They come from Taiwan, Japan, Hong
Kong, Thailand, Western Europe and from the United States, although
Americans are barred by their government from doing business in
Vietnam.
   Old-timers notice other changes, sometimes with regret. The
Shelf has been glassed in, air-conditioned, adorned with
neo-Grecian columns and crystal chandeliers.
   ``What I remember most about the Continental is the open
terrace, the ceiling fans, the colonial atmosphere,'' George
Belcher said. ``Now that's all gone.''
   Belcher, back on a visit, spent four years in Vietnam with the
U.S. aid mission.
   Dao Huu Loan, the manager, said the Continental's history and
architecture were of prime concern in the renovation.
   ``These days, around the world, there is a tendency to pull
everything down, destroy tradition and the beauty of the past,'' he
said. ``We have made some changes, but the basic structure is the
same.''
   Rooms cost an average of $70 a night, payable in U.S. dollars,
and Loan said the occupancy rate was 85 percent so far this year.
He hopes the Vietnam Year of Tourism proclaimed by the government
will attract more non-business travelers.
   ``The most important thing is to improve the service every
day,'' the manager said. He told an interviewer the 120 hotel
employees receive above-average salaries, plus bonuses for good
performance.
   Loan's government-run parcel of history competes with a
capitalist oasis of luxury its general manager, A. Patrick
Imbardelli, calls ``a monument to the new era in Vietnam.''
   Imbardelli's Saigon Floating Hotel is a 200-room steel behemoth
that may mar the exotic atmosphere of the Saigon River, but offers
foreigners direct- dial telephone service, French cheeses,
California wines and a business center with personal computers.
   Most of the guests so far have been businessmen, said
Imbardelli, the first foreigner to run a hotel in this communist
country.
   His hotel used to be anchored at Australia's Great Barrier Reef,
but did less business than its owners expected and was moved to the
Saigon River docks last year. It is an Australian-Japanese venture.

   The investment community is looking messy.
   The domestic securities industry has been forced to cut tens of
thousands of workers since the great crash of October 19, 1987, and
still some of its members are hurting financially.
   In the final quarter of 1989 the industry lost about $92
million. Almost half the brokerage house members of the New York
Stock Exchange were in the red.
   The price of a seat on the Big Board is down. The junk bond
market has just about collapsed. Takeovers, buyouts and mergers,
which helped some of the firms, have declined in number recently
and are likely to continue to do so.
   The investment community's reputation has been tarnished by
scandals, questionable practices and volatile prices. The public is
upset. The amount of stock held by individual investors shrank last
year by $104 billion.
   Individuals aren't the only sellers. Federal Reserve figures
show private pension funds, the biggest bundle of funds in the
world, cut their U.S. stock holdings last year by $20 billion. Many
were attracted to foreign stocks.
   Some big institutions, generally friends of Wall Street, have
been hurt. Hard as it might be to believe, insurance companies and
pension funds, usually the most conservative investors, hold 45
percent of all junk bonds issued.
   Some of those bonds are selling for less than half their
purchase price. Moreover, some of the issuers are in deep financial
difficulty and find it difficult to maintain the huge interest
rates they promised to pay.
   Adding insult, foreigners seem to be doing OK. They became wary
right after the big collapse in 1987, but now they seem to be
moving back in. Last year foreigners were net buyers of $8 billion
worth of stocks.
   More significantly, foreign brokers seem to be thriving right in
the same territory vacated by domestic brokers. While American
brokers hold wakes, some British, Japanese and Swiss firms
celebrate by hiring and expanding.
   The future is liable to be more competitive for the domestic
industry. Competition from foreigners isn't the sole reason. As
important, perhaps, is the fact that there are far fewer shares to
sell than there used to be.
   A lot of fee money poured into the investment community via
takeovers, mergers, leveraged buyouts. But that big money came at a
big price. Those very activities shrank the amount of U.S. equities
outstanding by $472 billion.
   It was accomplished through the departure of some very large
companies with their very large equities, gobbled up by other
companies that substituted debt for equity, junk bonds for shares.
   Not all is lost. You may be sure that imagination and nerve are
still alive in the investment community.
   There are those, for example, who'll bundle up those junk bonds
and somehow peddle them in a package. Moreover, it shouldn't be
forgotten that companies that took their shares off the market by
going private might go public again.
   It is often observed that when a broker convinces you to sell,
he or she has made more than one transaction. The sale is one, the
purchase of another stock is the second, the sale of that is the
third, and so on.
   Buy or sell, the commission is the same.
   It's the same with going private and then returning as a public
company. There is money either way.
   It has the appearance of what they call a win-win situation, but
it isn't, because an already wary public is bound to become further
disenchanted with the whole buisness.

   At 4.1 on the Richter scale, the earthquake on
the afternoon of March 20, 1980, was no great shakes. It knocked
snow off the north face of Mount St. Helens but went virtually
unnoticed in the surrounding counties of southwestern Washington.
   Nearly 130 miles to the north, the line traced by a wandering
pencil on a seismograph at the University of Washington was first
interpreted as evidence of a tremor 75 miles southeast of the
dormant volcano.
   But on closer inspection, seismologists determined the quake had
occurred under the mountain, and relatively close to the surface.
   It was the first recorded sign that Mount St. Helens' volcanic
fuse was lit. One week later, on March 27, the volcano belched
steam and ash in its first eruption in 123 years. The accompanying
4.7-magnitude quake sent seismic needles skittering.
   Fifty-two days after that, on May 18, 1980, the mountain
exploded spectacularly. The eruption killed 57 people and sent ash
around the world. In an instant, 1,300 feet of the mountain
disappeared, fully a fifth of its towering majesty simply blown
away.
   The smoking, raw-edged crater left behind stunned residents of
Washington and Oregon used to gazing out at a symmetrical,
snowcapped peak.
   ``It woke people up to the fact that having a volcano in your
back yard can be dangerous,'' said Dwight Crandell, retired from
the U.S. Geological Survey. In 1978, Crandell helped write a report
that predicted an eruption at Mount St. Helens this century.
   The blast was also a wake-up call for volcanologists around the
world. In the 1970s, only two countries with volcanic mountains
were examining the dangers of nearby human settlements. Today 16
countries have active studies under way, Crandell said by telephone
from his home in Denver.
   ``It's clear that the 1980 eruption was a sensation for the
science of volcanology,'' said geologist Steve Brantley, stationed
at the USGS Cascade Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash., about
45 miles southwest of Mount St. Helens. About 80 scientists work at
the observatory, built after the eruption.
   UW seismologist Steve Malone said the March 20 earthquake was
strong enough to draw attention to the area but not so unusual as
to make scientists suspicious that molten rock was squeezing into
crevices deep under the earth.
   ``Earthquakes at the volcano are not unheard of,'' Malone said.
``They generate a bit of interest but not immediate alarm.''
   But quakes kept coming, increasing in number and strength. Three
days after the initial quake, UW seismologists warned the USGS
about a ``potentially serious situation.''
   ``This was when we first suspected we might be on to something
other than just a small earthquake swarm,'' Malone said.
   Teams of geologists arrived to set up equipment to monitor
ground movement and the gases emitted each time the volcano burped.
Seismologists stayed close to their machines. The Forest Service
began warning people to stay clear of the mountain because of
avalanches.
   But the scientists were not working in isolation. Scores of
eager newspaper and broadcast reporters joined the crush.
Researchers accustomed to working in geologic time, in a science
where more is unknown than known, were being asked to provide
instant answers for that evening's news and the next morning's
newspapers.
   ``I remember ... being a bit overwhelmed by the media interest
this was already generating,'' Malone said. ``All we had was data
and some possibilities and a lot of questions.''
   Meantime, the ground was moving at postcard-perfect Spirit Lake,
at the mountain's foot. Chuck Tonn, who ran the Forest Service desk
at the lake, hung a pencil from a string to show the faint shaking.
The lake was evacuated Tuesday morning, March 25.
   ``I was glad to leave that morning,'' Tonn said. ``That last
night, I don't think any of us slept. ... It seemed like there was
always some movement going on.''
   Not everyone left. Harry Truman, the 83-year-old owner and
keeper of rustic Spirit Lake Lodge, dug in his heels. Truman said
he would stay on the mountain that had been his home for 50 years,
the mountain that eight weeks later would kill him. In the media
catering to the nation's rising anticipation, Truman became a
cantankerous folk hero.
   Another local, Stan Lee, 67, owner of the Kid Valley Store about
20 miles from the peak, snorted at talk of a possible eruption and
accused the Forest Service of plotting to squelch development. Two
days later, the mountain blew.
   That first eruption shot a black plume almost a mile and a half
high. By mid-April, the stark gray and brown hollow of a crater had
replaced the mountain's snowy point, once 9,677 feet above sea
level. Ashfalls in the region were commonplace, with fickle winds
determining who got dusted next.
   May 18, 1980, the day the mountain finally blew its top, is now
designated Eruption Day in Geological Survey books. On those who
were there and experienced the power and awe and terror, Mount St.
Helens has left its mark as clearly as the eruption scarred the
landscape.
   ``I feel fortunate to have been at Mount St. Helens from the
beginning all these 10 years,'' said Tonn, who now manages the
Forest Service's visitors' center west of the 110,000-acre National
Volcanic Monument.
   ``It (eruption) kind of puts me in my place. It puts me in awe
of what can happen.''
   For Crandell and fellow USGS geologist Donal Mullineaux, the
eruption was right on time. After studying dormant Cascade Range
volcanoes in the 1960s and 1970s, they predicted in 1978 that Mount
St. Helens would likely erupt relatively soon.
   ``Everything we found indicated it was a very young volcano, and
a very explosive volcano, and a frequently active volcano,'' which
last erupted in 1857, Crandell said. ``We felt almost sure the
volcano would erupt, and sooner rather than later. That is what the
history told us.''
   While some public officials greeted their hazard report
seriously, there were also snickers, the two scientists said. ``A
lot of people made fun of it, of course,'' Mullineaux said.
   Crandell said he was gratified that many countries with
volcanoes have since made use of their work in hazard assessment,
including New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Mexico, Equador and Colombia.
   The eruption of Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz in November 1985
provides an example of how hazard assessment could have helped,
Crandell said. An assessment had been completed, and hazard zones
had been laid out, including likely flood and mudflow zones at the
town of Armero. But word never reached local officials. There were
no evacuations and 25,000 people perished.
   Mount St. Helens prompted gains in both volcanology and
seismology. Since 1980, scientists have learned to better predict
volcanic eruptions by studying earthquake activity, including the
``harmonic tremors'' that indicate movement of molten earth.
   Other volcanic mysteries are also better understood, Crandell
said. These include the devastating sideways force of the May 1980
eruption, the fast-moving and deadly mixtures of matter and gas
known as pyroclastic flows and surges, and the mudflows that let
loose in minutes after vibrations turn snowfields into walls of
water.
   Mullineaux and Crandell retired in the mid-1980s, but both
remain active in research on Mount St. Helens.
   ``I can't leave it alone,'' Crandell said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1969 and 1970, veteran Hollywood observer
Harry Shearer covered the Oscar Awards show as a member of a radio
comedy troupe, Credibility Gap. They had press credentials and
everything.
   They did deliberately what some reporters do accidentally on
Oscar night, he recalls: ``We went with the avowed purpose of
asking the most inane questions anybody could ask of winners, like,
`Have you ever been to New York?'''
   Alas, Shearer won't be covering tonight's Oscar show, which
starts at 9 p.m. EST and will be televised live by ABC.
   He's not even going, even though he once co-wrote and appeared
in the noted rock documentary film, ``This Is Spinal Tap.''
   But he'll be back in journalism, sort of, on April 18, reporting
results of a national celebrity poll in an NBC special, ``Spy
Magazine Presents How to Be Famous.''
   The magazine's mission is to poke fun at those in need of poking.
   Shearer, a contributing editor to the publication, say the NBC
show ``is about the whole idea of being a celebrity in America,
what it takes to be one and to stay one.
   ``The SPY study is pretty scientific _ at least as scientific as
the research film studios do to discover what movies to make,'' he
said. ``They go into a shopping mall and ask three people, `Would
you like to see three men and an alien? Three aliens and a baby?' ''
   Shearer knows whereof he speaks, having been born in Los Angeles
and in show business since he was a tyke. His big break was the
1953 film classic, ``Abbott and Costello Go to Mars.''
   A veteran of ``Saturday Night Live'' and various cable ventures,
including his own HBO special, ``The Magic of Live,'' he currently
does various voices on Fox Broadcasting's hit ``The Simpsons.''
   He also conducts a weekly National Public Radio show, ``Le
Show,'' from KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, Calif.
   He may or may not use the radio show as a forum for thoughts on
Monday's Oscar festival. It depends.
   However, he says, ``I'm uniquely qualified to comment on the
Oscar show because I followed my usual policy of not seeing any of
the nominated pictures.''
   Shearer has an alternate-year policy. One year he avoids the
Oscar show, the next year he's watching the thing on TV with
friends, ``just laughing our way through the evening.''
   ``Because to me, the best thing about the Oscar show is the
marvelous bad fit between the joke-writing and the people who have
to say the lines. The writing and the performances come from two
different planets.''
   But he isn't against the Oscar show. Far from it.
   ``Actually, of all the unnecessary award shows that seem to have
proliferated ... this is the only one that makes any sense at
all,'' he submits. ``Because it's the only one where, immediately
afterwards, whoever wins an award gets more money.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   AND THE WINNER IS, PART 14: Another awards show will arrive
April 25, the 26th annual ``Academy of County Music Awards.'' To be
shown on NBC, it will originate from ... Nashville? Nooo. Hollywood.
   ANOTHER REASON TO CONTINUE LIVING: CBS on April 3 will show a TV
movie of high drama, ``Laker Girls.'' CBS says it is about three
young women ``whose lives change when they become part of the
famous dance squad that performs at home games'' for the Los
Angeles Lakers.

<TEXT>
   When the bulldozers came to raze
Mohammad Massoud's home, the call for help went out to his squatter
neighborhood and men from 30 houses answered.
   They attacked the bulldozer drivers, forcing them to flee.
Paramilitary troops arrived, wielding sticks and truncheons, but
Massoud's friends drove them off.
   The battle for Massoud's house was one of a hundred skirmishes
that have earned the squatter settlement of 5,000 people the name
Zorabad, or ``People Power Village.''
   ``With nothing but our bare Afghan fists, we took on the
government and won,'' said Massoud, seated in his sparsely
furnished house built of mud bricks. ``That is how we got our
name.''
   For the time being, at least, Zorabad is ahead.
   In late 1989, the government abandoned almost seven years of
efforts to remove the people and their single-story mud houses from
government land. Now the community's elders are negotiating with
officials to supply electricity.
   The name Zorabad brings a smile to the lips of many Afghans,
whose tradition is one of independence and casual regard for
authority.
   In a capital closely patrolled by military and intelligence
forces, the squatter village on the northern outskirts represents a
rare victory of the people over those in charge.
   Zorabad also has a wider significance. It illustrates the return
of President Najib's Soviet-sponsored government to the old Afghan
ways, in which local tribes pledge loyalty to a central government
but retain control of local affairs.
   After abandoning efforts to evict the squatters, officials
generally have ignored Zorabad.
   A new effort to collect taxes is made now and then, but the
people say they won't pay unless they get services. Zorabad has no
schools, garbage collection, doctors, running water or electricity.
   One city official, who would not discuss the situation unless
his name wasn't used, said the government's main desire was that
Zorabad's politically sensitive name be changed to Nawabad, or
``New Village.''
   Disputes within Zorabad are resolved by elders.
   One of the elders, Said Mahmoud, explained: ``Only when we have
a serious crime do we ask for police, and then they don't really
like to come here. Last week, two clans had a fight over food.
There were many casualties, but we handled it alone.''
   Most residents come from northern Afghanistan, which was heavily
bombed during the nine years of Soviet combat support for the
government's war against Moslem guerrillas.
   Soviet bombing raids seven years ago leveled Shakardarah,
Mahmoud's home village 18 miles north of Kabul. He lost four sons,
his small pharmacy and several acres of grapes.
   ``We had no place to go,'' he said. ``We didn't want to go to
Pakistan or Iran, so we came here.'' Millions of Afghans have fled
to the two neighboring countries.
   Hundreds of other families from Shakardarah came to Kabul with a
horde of refugees from all over the country, looking for work and
shelter.
   Kabul's population had more than doubled, to 2.25 million, by
the end of the Soviet intervention on Feb. 15, 1989. It seems to be
declining now, as some people return home to areas where fighting
has eased.
   When refugees were streaming into Kabul, demands on the
government's scarce resources were overwhelming and it did little
or nothing to help them.
   So, Mahmoud said, ``some of us from my village had a meeting,
and we decided to seize government land.''
   Their chosen site is adjoined on two sides by comfortable
government housing and adjacent to Kabul's dog-fighting fields.
   Refugees from other villages joined Massoud's people, built
homes and found jobs. Many now are truck drivers, engaged in the
lucrative smuggling trade with Pakistan, and others work in auto
repair shops or as street sweepers.
   The government sent emissaries to ask the squatters to leave
Zorabad, apparently at the urging of officials living in the
neighboring apartment complex.
   Massoud and the others refused and continued to build, expanding
their small clusters of houses into a warren of thousands.
Alleyways twisted this way and that; small shops opened, selling
dried fruits and nuts.
   Then the bulldozers came. After the paramilitary troops were
turned back, officials arranged a truce in an effort to avoid
bloodshed. That was in late November. No more bulldozers have
appeared.
   Residents say they're happy to be left alone, but would like to
tap into the power lines that carry electricity past them to the
government apartment buildings.
   At night, when the apartments blaze with lights and television
serials flicker through the windows, Zorabad looks like an old ruin.
   ``We call ourselves `People Power Village','' Massoud said,
``but our power is not enough.''

<HEAD>With AM-California Execution, b0467</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Each time the U.S. Supreme Court issues a major capital
punishment ruling, a blood bath is predicted at the nation's death
houses. But execution statistics do not bear out those fears.
   California, which has the country's third-largest death row
population, is preparing for its first execution in 23 years, set
for April 3.
   Capital punishment opponents say the prolonged period between
executions is indicative of Americans' ambivalence about the death
penalty: They support it in theory, but not in practice.
   A recent survey indicated 79 percent of Californians polled
favored the death penalty in general. But 67 percent preferred the
option of life in prison without parole combined with a work
program, an alternative not currently available in the state.
   ``When people are given the alternative of life rather than the
death penalty, people will (choose) life,'' said Ramona Ripston,
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California. ``I think the poll shows people don't want to kill
people.''
   States have executed 121 people since the Supreme Court allowed
the revival of death penalty statutes in 1976. Thirty-six states
have death penalty laws, under which some 200 people are sentenced
each year.
   Sixteen murderers were executed nationwide in 1989, up from
1988's 11 but down from 1987, when 25 men were gassed, electrocuted
or poisoned intravenously.
   The Supreme Court has issued three major opinions in the past
three years that opponents feared would speed the rate of
executions.
   In 1989, in two separate rulings, the justices refused to call a
blanket halt to the execution of retarded people or convicts who
committed capital crimes as 16- and 17-year-olds. And a 1987 ruling
in a Georgia case held that death penalty laws can be valid even if
statistics suggest they are carried out with racial bias.
   ``The reason that the floodgates did not open following those
landmark decisions, in my opinion, is that reason prevails in
matters as serious as capital punishment,'' said Stephen Merrill,
former attorney general of New Hampshire, a state with a death
penalty statute but no one on death row.
   ``Even those of us who favor capital punishment are very slow
and very cautious concerning its use as a tool within the criminal
justice system,'' Merrill said.
   The court this year is reviewing more than a half-dozen death
penalty cases, but none is expected to yield a ruling with dramatic
results.
   Americans generally favor the death penalty when surveyed, but
once people start dying, fewer folks support the process, said
Wellborn Jack Jr., a defense lawyer in Shreveport, La.
   ``Until the death penalty came back and we started having
executions, it was a real easy thing to say, `I'm for the death
penalty,''' Jack said.
   ``You had to kill some people. Now that we've killed them, and
we did have the floodgates open up, people don't want to be a part
of it.''
   In July 1989, the latest national figures available, there were
2,264 men and 25 women on the nation's death rows. Florida had the
most with 294, followed by Texas with 283, California with 247 and
Georgia with 102. Louisiana had 39.
   Texas has executed 33 convicts, Florida 21, Louisiana 18 and
Georgia 14, said Karima Wicks, research director of the capital
punishment project of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund in
New York.
   The South is by far the deadliest region for condemned killers,
she said.
   ``We are a more bloodthirsty region,'' Wicks said. ``Executions
in the South are sort of latter-day lynchings.''

reliable old ones.
   ``It gets intense out there when everyone is asking, so
sometimes being different works,'' said Michelle Davis, executive
director of the Republican Governors Association.
   Davis describes the traditional fund-raiser like this: ``You
dress up, you go to a dinner, you listen to people give speeches,
you write your check and you go home.''
   The big money in politics still comes from these big-name
fund-raising dinners and from the huge ``soft money'' contributions
that corporations and labor unions make to party organizations.
   But some of the newest fund-raising methods rely on high-tech
gimmicks such as 900-number telephone lines and electronic fund
transfers that allow fast and easy access to contributors' bank
accounts.
   The Republican governors' group, meanwhile, is adding a little
glitz but sticking to basics as it tries to offer contributors more
than a chicken dinner for their checks. The group is holding
smaller, more intimate sessions at which donors can chat with
governors and other prominent Republicans.
   ``We have to do more than we have in the past _ to add a little
cachet,'' Davis said.
   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which helps
elect Democrats to the House, this year added the Preakness to the
lineup of big sporting events for which it offers tickets in
exchange for contributions. Super Bowl parties long have been
fund-raising favorites.
   The committee, hard pressed for cash, also is raising more money
than ever from Democratic incumbents who have cash to spare in
their huge campaign war chests.
   The anti-Helms effort, sponsored by a North Carolina State
University professor, is but one example of the growing popularity
of 900 phone lines as a political tool. The National Rifle
Association started the trend a year ago and quickly raised $2.5
million.
   Kent Hance, defeated in the Texas GOP gubernatorial primary this
month, charged $3.95 a call for a message from his anti-tax group.
The campaign pocketed $2 a call.
   The Helms and Hance phone lines come cheap when compared with
the two 900 lines set up by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas,
the Senate's 1989 fund-raising king. The senator charged $25 and
$50 for two 900 lines that gave callers recorded voter registration
information and details about a fund-raiser Gramm was holding with
President Bush.
   The Federal Election Commission has looked at a number of legal
questions related to political use of 900 lines, which critics say
can easily be used to avoid or bend contribution limits.
   Democrats also are raising questions about the National
Republican Senatorial Committee's ``Candidate Escrow Funding''
program _ the $12.50 a month direct-deposit gimmick. Participants
get a $25 check in exchange for authorizing monthly bank debits
that will increase 10 percent a year.
   ``Leave it to the Republicans to figure another way to con
you,'' Texas Democratic Chairman Bob Slagle said of the GOP effort.
   The Republicans have revised the fund-raising letter that goes
with the $25 check to make it clearer that people will pay out more
than that in the long run and have set up a toll-free telephone
line to answer questions.
   Some more traditional fund-raising gambits also still stir
controversy from time to time, such as mailings that cash in on
someone's name without their permission.
   Some 200,000 letters mailed out by ``Friends of Dan Quayle''
late last year sought contributions to support the conservative
agenda, yet Quayle had nothing to do with the mailing and gets none
of the money.
   The donations go to the Congressional Majority Committee, a
conservative political action committee that used Gramm's name in a
similar pitch several years ago. Provided such fund-raising letters
include a disclaimer, there isn't much Quayle or any other
politician can do to stop the practice.
   Railing against enemies is another proven fund-raising gimmick,
and Democrats put it to use with a new twist late last year.
   The party jumped out ahead of the Republicans by soliciting
money to counter anticipated attacks against its candidates by GOP
operatives Lee Atwater, Roger Ailes and Ed Rollins.

   The Supreme Court's nine members are among the
most private of public officials. They wield enormous political
power but rarely hold news conferences or give interviews. Recent
polls indicate only one in three Americans can name any of the
nine. This, the fifth in an occasional series, offers an up-to-date
look at one member of the nation's high court.

<TEXT>
   The night before she was to undergo cancer
surgery in 1988, Sandra Day O'Connor drove nearly seven hours to
keep a longstanding commitment to deliver a college lecture.
   Completing that chore seems hardly suprising for the
hard-working and strong-willed Supreme Court justice who, as she
turns 60 on Monday, is arguably the nation's most powerful woman.
   The high court's first and only woman, she is unquestionably a
figure of historic significance.
   O'Connor can exert unusual influence over divisive issues
confronting American society, particularly abortion rights. As the
most moderate member of a new but slender conservative court
majority, her vote often holds the key in 5-4 rulings that define
American law.
   Feminists and civil libertarians are disappointed she has not
wielded her power more forcefully for women's rights, minorities
and the poor.
   But her performance sometimes leaves conservatives, including a
fellow justice, less than fully satisfied.
   Few question her energy or independence.
   ``From the get-go she's called her own shots,'' said Robert
Jerome Glennon, a law professor at the University of Arizona.
   ``I find her a fascinating figure,'' he said, noting she is the
only justice who ever held elective office and apparently still
draws on that experience.
   She was a member of the state Senate in her native Arizona in
the early 1970s and rose to majority leader, the first woman in the
country to hold such a position.
   O'Connor, who declined to be interviewed for this article, says
she averages 60 hours a week on the job, including Saturdays. She
also often takes work home with her.
   She had a breast removed in cancer surgery in 1988, followed by
months of chemotherapy treatment. It hardly seemed to slow her, and
she reports she is fully recovered.
   The night before the operation O'Connor drove to Lexington, Va.,
to lecture at Washington &amp; Lee University. She was back on the
bench 10 days later.
   She and her lawyer husband, John, maintain an active social life
that includes tennis, golf and frequent appearances on the
Washington party circuit.
   She also organized an exercise class at the court and works out
first thing in the morning. ``It's just part of my routine and has
been for a very long time in Arizona,'' she has explained.
   O'Connor may have acquired her resilience growing up on the
family's 162,000-acre cattle ranch in Arizona, where as a child she
learned to ride a horse, mend fences and shoot a rifle.
   She was thrust into the national spotlight in 1981 when
then-President Reagan chose her, a relatively obscure state judge,
to end 191 years of male exclusivity on the high court.
   ``My first year on the court made me long at times for
obscurity,'' she said years later.
   Her prominence grew last year as the justices once again were
asked to overturn their 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that women have a
constitutional right to abortion.
   The court, including O'Connor, gave states new power to limit
abortions. But she refused to provide the fifth vote conservatives
needed to overturn Roe vs. Wade.
   An exasperated Justice Antonin Scalia, often an O'Connor ally,
called her stand irrational.
   O'Connor never has cast a high court vote to overturn a state
regulation on abortion. But Glennon, the Arizona law professor,
sides with scholars who believe she never will cast the deciding
vote to overturn Roe vs. Wade.
   ``Is Justice O'Connor, the first woman on the Supreme Court,
going to provide the fifth vote to overrule the most important
women's rights decision in the history of court? I think the answer
is no,'' he said.
   A definitive answer may not be that far off as state
legislatures enact restrictions on abortions that under Roe vs.
Wade are clearly unconstitutional.
   For example, the Idaho Legislature passed a bill last week
outlawing abortions except to protect a woman's life or physical
health and in some cases of rape, incest and fetal deformity. If
the bill is signed into law, it certainly will prompt a
constitutional challenge that could reach the high court.
   On many issues, critics are troubled by O'Connor's willingness
to limit individual rights and limit federal court redress.
   Nan Aron, director of the liberal Alliance for Justice, said
O'Connor, who early in her career gave up practicing law for five
years to stay home with her three sons, is an admirable role model
for working women determined to be good parents.
   But O'Connor ``has not been a fighter for justice,'' Ms. Aron
said. ``She's part of a majority on the court that seeks to limit
and constrain the court's role in society. It's a disappointing
trend.''
   O'Connor has personal experience with sex bias. When she
graduated third in her law school class at Stanford University in
1952, the only California law firm that wanted to hire her offered
her a job as a secretary.
   On the court during oral arguments, she appears stern and
straight-laced, sometimes sounding impatient as she interrogates
lawyers with well-prepared questions.
   But friends say she drops the reserve in less formal
surroundings and is gracious, caring and humorous.
   A couple of years ago O'Connor returned to El Paso, Texas, where
she attended school as a child. Presented a key to the city, she
got a laugh when suggesting that her ``frightening'' school
principal, now deceased, might not have wanted her to have the key.
   O'Connor, who lives in Chevy Chase, Md., recently told her local
paper, the Gazette, that she expects more women to be appointed to
the court. ``And I hope I'm still on it when the first one
arrives,'' she said.

   The Census Bureau's attempt to count the
homeless last week focused attention on the unknown numbers of
Americans with nowhere to live. A decade after street people first
captured the nation's sympathy, has real progress been made toward
helping them?

   The story of the home that Jack built is in many ways a typical
tale of the homeless, except that it has a happy ending.
   Out of work in the Midwest where he grew up, Jack heard about
jobs in Colorado. En route, his old car broke down and he finished
the trip by hitchhiking, dropped off finally at the Greyhound bus
station in Denver.
   ``I had two dollars and some change in my pocket. I was in a
position in my life that I'd never been in before: I had no idea
what to do,'' said Jack, who declined to give his surname because
he doesn't want his fellow workers to know about his past.
   ``I prayed that night, I'll tell you,'' he recalled. Through
providence or the luck of the draw in a lottery for limited space,
he got a bed _ and a new start _ at a shelter called Samaritan
House.
   Its jobs program helped steer him toward temporary work moving
furniture as he looked for a job with a future. Samaritan House
helped him save money, too, with budget counseling and the
opportunity to stay on even after he was working.
   These days, Jack has his own apartment. He's shopping for
furniture. He's working as a fast-food restaurant manager, and,
says Kathy Rembert of Samaritan House, ``now he's calling me when
he has openings.''
   There have been successes in the 10 years or so since Americans
first recognized that thousands of their fellow citizens were
homeless _ victims of circumstance like Jack as well as
de-institutionalized mental patients, vagrant alcoholics and drug
addicts.
   At the same time, there have been setbacks, even tragedies. Last
November in Boston, a homeless Vietnam combat veteran was moved
from the streets to a nursing home after his frostbitten hands and
feet were amputated.
   Stubbornly, homelessness remains _ visible on the streets of
every major city, hidden in rural shacks with neither heat nor
water. It persists despite billions of dollars spent for shelters
and emergency aid, despite polltakers' evidence that Americans want
an urgent response from the government.
   President Bush has called homelessness a national tragedy.
   After years in which advocates for the homeless accused the
government of indifference, the Bush administration has pressed for
full financing of programs under the Stewart B. McKinney Act, the
main homeless aid effort, which Congress passed in 1987, and has
proposed other initiatives targeted at the homeless mentally ill,
drug abusers and alcoholics.
   Those projects are part of a program called HOPE, for Home
Ownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere. Bush's budget
proposal for the coming year seeks about $1.2 billion for this
program, including nearly $250 million for the ``hard-to-serve''
homeless. The remainder would be mainly to increase low-income
housing.
   The homeless component would provide up to five years of rent
subsidies for individuals, with the stipulation that communities
match this assistance with rehabilitative services.
   ``The administration is committed to ending homelessness,'' said
Anna Kondratas, assistant secretary of housing and urban
development. ``And we're going to be prepared to do what it takes
to get the homeless into permanent housing and to get them the kind
of services they need to stay in that housing.''
   Some homeless advocates are less than impressed.
   ``It's a turnaround of extremely modest proportions'' from the
Reagan years, said Maria Foscarinis, who heads the National Law
Center on Homelessness and Poverty in Washington.
   The low-income housing portion of Bush's proposal, she said, is
``extremely small ... when you consider all the cuts that have been
made over the past few years.''
   Advocates say a drop in appropriations for new housing for the
poor in the 1980s contributed to homelessness, although HUD
officials assert that spending merely shifted from construction to
rent subsidies.
   Also blamed for causing homelessness are the loss of rooming
house-type apartments to ``gentrification'' or deterioration,
``economic dislocation'' when unemployed people move in search of
work, and the release of thousands of mental patients to the
streets when institutions scaled back care.
   Last week's census in shelters and the streets was intended to
provide a better guess at the number of homeless people, as
estimates now range from 250,000 to more than 3 million. A survey
by the U.S. Conference of Mayors last year found demand for shelter
up by 25 percent in a year.
   Those who provide shelter say that's continuing.
   ``Seems like it's a never-ending thing,'' said Joe Flaherty,
whose shelter in Little Rock, Ark., found 254 full-time jobs for
residents last year and 211 the year before. It is expanding its
quarters.
   Evan Doss, who oversees a shelter in Port Gibson, Miss., spoke
of rural homelessness. ``We have people in abandoned cars and
abandoned shacks ... living without electricity, without heat,
without plumbing.''
   Since 1987, McKinney Act and other federal funds for the
homeless have amounted to more than $1.78 billion, according to
HUD, with state, local and private spending adding even more.
   Still, said Fred Griesbach, executive director of the National
Coalition for the Homeless in New York, many basic issues still go
unaddressed.
   Seemingly large allocations such as the HOPE proposal need to be
put in perspective, he said.
   ``People look at $250 million and say that's a lot of money,''
he said, but not when compared to amounts federal officials spent
on the savings and loan failures. ``They're willing to put billions
and billions to bail out the S&amp;Ls, because that was a `crisis.'
Homelessness is not perceived as a crisis.''
   The administration's response, Griesbach said, has been ``a
thousand points of hype.''
   Although public sympathy has run high for the homeless, as
indicated by polls, there have been signs of frustration that after
years of work and billions spent, the homeless re-appear every day
on corners.
   A number of cities, including Minneapolis and Tulsa, Okla., have
passed ordinances regulating panhandling. Business owners in
Atlanta, Philadelphia and other cities have complained. In New
York, a man was charged with manslaughter in the death of a beggar
he said attacked him and his young son.
   ``Do I see a backlash in the country? Yeah,'' said Ken Smith,
who runs a shelter for homeless veterans in Boston. ``Why? Because
I think they're becoming aggravated by the fact that they can't
walk a city block without being asked for money.''
   If the thousands of dollars given daily to panhandlers went to
charitable programs for the homeless, some of those who support
themselves by begging would be forced instead to go to those
programs and get help, he said.
   Griesbach calls a backlash inevitable after all these years:
   ``Homelessness didn't go away. And there is a large number of
people who felt, well, wait a minute _ we volunteered, we did our
bit in church basements, we contributed to programs like Hands
Across America.
   ``How come these people are still here?''

<HEAD>Novelist Puts Prestige on Line in Campaign for Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mario Vargas Llosa, the acclaimed novelist,
has put his prestige on the line in trying to become president of
his violent, troubled homeland.
   Vargas Llosa is the strong favorite to win the April 8 election
and replace the populist Alan Garcia on July 28.
   Why does an urbane, international figure often mentioned for the
Nobel Prize fight so hard for the mandate to govern an
impoverished, chaotic nation bloodied by a savage leftist
insurgency?
   Vargas Llosa says he overcame his distaste for politics and
ignored the warnings of friends because he felt a responsibility to
those who supported his campaign against the attempt to nationalize
the banks in 1987.
   He organized a rally of 100,000 people against the bank takeover
and told the crowd Garcia's plan was a totalitarian threat.
   That catapulted Vargas Llosa into the political arena. The
author of ``The Green House,'' ``Conversation in the Cathedral,''
``Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter'' and many other works, has been
there since.
   The maker of tales about Peru's jungle mysteries, its urban
decay, its corrupt dictators and failed revolutionaries has not
written a line for publication in two years.
   He acknowledges being frightened by the prospect of governing a
nation that seems increasingly ungovernable.
   ``Peru's situation is enormously difficult and it's going to
grow worse in coming months,'' he said during an interview in the
second-floor library of his home on a cliff overlooking the Pacific.
   ``At the same time, I think Peru has a chance to recover
precisely because of the magnitude of the crisis,'' he said.
   ``Paradoxically, a profound crisis leads a country to deep
reforms. When it is a middling crisis, the illusion remains that
what failed was men and not the system.''
   His nation's crisis could not be much deeper.
   The output of the economy has shrunk 20 percent in two years.
Inflation soared to 2,775 percent in 1989.
   Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs. The
decade-long rebellion of the Shining Path guerrillas, a fanatical
Maoist group, has taken nearly 20,000 lives.
   Many Peruvians look to Vargas Llosa as a savior. They did the
same with Garcia, who campaigned in 1985 as ``the president of
hope'' and now is viewed as having failed miserably.
   ``It frightens me when I hear phrases like that at rallies; that
is why I try not to make promises I can't keep,'' said Vargas Llosa.
   ``On the contrary,'' he said, ``I always say there is going to
be a period of great sacrifice before Peru can begin to recover.''
   Vargas Llosa, 54, preaches that a free market will halt the
slide into anarchy. He contends government intervention has caused
20 years of economic decline and eliminating the thick net of
controls is the only way to reverse it.
   ``When the market is allowed to operate freely, it produces
great creative development,'' he said.
   Campaigning as the candidate of the Democratic Front, a
center-right coalition, Vargas Llosa has spelled out the radical
reforms he says are needed to make Peru a ``modern nation.''
   He has avoided the slogans of previous presidential campaigns,
preferring to risk votes with frankness about the social cost of
his program.
   ``If I reach the presidency, the only thing that will give me
sufficient strength to do what must be done is if the Peruvian
people have elected me knowing exactly what to expect,'' he said.
   Vargas Llosa promises to sell all 232 state enterprises, most of
which lose money, and slash hundreds of thousands of jobs from the
bloated bureaucracy.
   A Vargas Llosa government would ease restrictions on foreign
investment to create jobs and would end price controls, reduce
import restrictions and force Peru's flabby, protected private
enterprise to compete.
   ``I believe in competition,'' he said. ``I believe that our
national industries should be competitive, efficient industries,
not parasitic industries.''
   He expects fierce resistance by business leaders who have
profited from government favors and by Communist labor bosses who
represent the country's bureaucrats.
   ``There are going to be many problems because a society in which
the state has been the great distributor of privileges creates a
dependent mentality in people,'' said the candidate, who came home
in 1974 after living and writing for 15 years in Paris, London and
Barcelona, Spain.
   His campaign takes him through streets piled high with rotting
garbage, where children in rags and mothers with babies in their
arms beg on every corner, where tear gas chokes innocents caught in
clashes between riot police and striking workers.
   He visits public markets to talk with housewives who despair
over food prices that are 25 times higher than 12 months ago.
   The author said he does not like politicking.
   ``I don't feel comfortable with it,'' he said. ``I try to take
it in a sporting spirit with good humor, but it's hard work for me.
You need a certain quota of histrionics, and I don't have it. I
have to force myself to do these things.''
   Vargas Llosa's image as a political amateur and his frankness
about his plans for the country appeal to Peruvians fed up with
easy promises, say analysts for polling firms.
   Surveys show him with about 45 percent of voter support in a
field of 10. His closest competitors are Luis Alva Castro, former
finance minister in the Garcia government, with 16 percent, and
Alfonso Barrantes, a Marxist and former mayor of Lima, with 12
percent.
   Presidents of Peru are limited to one 5-year term, so Garcia
could not run again.
   A majority is needed to avoid a runoff, and Vargas Llosa is
confident of attracting enough undecided voters to get it.
   If a second round is necessary, polls show him winning by a
landslide.
   Opponents have accused Vargas Llosa of tax evasion and planning
an ``apocalyptic'' economic program to fulfill his pledge of
cutting annual inflation to 10 percent.
   Nightly television commercials predict 30,000 percent inflation,
food riots, mass starvation and escalating terrorism if he is
elected. The spots show vultures walking through pools of blood.
   ``The campaign has confirmed my worst instincts about
politics,'' Vargas Llosa said. ``It's a world that brings out the
dirtiest things in men. Power attracts men and makes them willing
to do anything to achieve it and hold on to it.''
   When he opposed Garcia's attempt to nationalize the banks, a
group of political independents rallied around Vargas Llosa and
formed the Liberty movement. It later joined with the centrist
Popular Action and conservative Popular Christian Party in the
Democratic Front.
   ``At a certain point it became difficult to reject this
candidacy,'' he said. ``It seemed to me unethical to say to people,
after I had encouraged them to get involved, that this was as far
as I was going, to say that I didn't want to risk my career as a
writer.''
   Will there be a novel about this some day?
   Vargas Llosa laughed and said: ``I don't know if it will be a
novel, but if I survive this experience, I will have great material
for a book. No doubt about it.''

   Anti-smoking activists say a tobacco
company is exploiting femininity to sell poison by marketing a new
cigarette designed specifically for women.
   Golden Tobacco Co. introduced the brand, called Ms, last month
with a campaign aimed at career women.
   ``Who says a woman wants to be like a man?'' say advertisements
that show young Indian women dressed in Western skirts and blouses
instead of traditional saris. They appeal to the female smoker with
``an independent mind ... a liberated lifestyle ... who competes in
a man's world.''
   One critic, Taposh Roy, responds: ``Women who smoke like men
will die like men.''
   ``Why should a woman have a separate cigarette for herself?''
Roy asked. ``How is it less dangerous than a so-called man's
cigarette?''
   He said the company was exploiting femininity in a developing
country at a time of increasing pressure against smoking in the
West. Roy heads the anti-tobacco program of the private Voluntary
Health Association of India.
   No figures are available on the number of women smokers in
India, but a government survey found 25 percent of women 15 or
older use tobacco by smoking, chewing, or eating it with betel leaf.
   Women in villages commonly smoke ``beedis'' or ``chuttas'' _
hand-rolled leaves stuffed with uncured tobacco _ but Ashis Nandy,
a social scientist, said smoking is rare among urban women.
   Pinaki Pan of Golden Tobacco said the company decided to
introduce a cigarette for women because ``there was a sizable
market out there. Our market research showed that 50 percent of the
target group bought imported brands.''
   He said Ms offers women an alternative, and is ``a feminine
cigarette _ sleeker, whiter and milder.''
   ``We are not making a conscious attempt to entice non-smokers,''
Pak said. ``It is only the smokers, especially the career women,
who are our intended consumers.''
   Nandy said women smokers were considered ``liberated or of loose
character'' until a few years ago, a view reinforced by Indian
movies that showed female accomplices of the villains smoking and
drinking liquor.
   ``The social stigma led to women smoking in the privacy of
locked bedrooms or office bathrooms,'' said Padma Rao, a
34-year-old journalist who began smoking at 18.
   Ms. Rao said she smokes openly at home or at parties where it is
acceptable, but still slips into the restroom at the office.
   Roy said women who were hesitant about smoking in public would
be encouraged by the Ms ads to indulge openly.
   ``The closet smoker will come out, and the market is so rich
that other companies will introduce their women's brands,'' he
said. ``This is crazy, especially at a time when the tobacco
industry is dying in the developed world.''
   Twelve companies make cigarettes at 18 plants in India, which
ranks third in tobacco production after China and the United
States. The industry employs 20,000 people directly and millions
indirectly.
   ``It is a woman's business if she wants to smoke, but to sell
cigarettes only to women is nothing but asking more and more ladies
to try smoking, a direct invitation to adopt cancer,'' said
Ravinder Kumar, president of the National Salvation Front, an
anti-corruption social group.
   Cigarette consumption in India increased 400 percent from 1970
to 1980, the latest decade for which figures are available, said
Usha Luthra of the official Indian Council for Medical Research,
   A study by Ms. Luthra said 20 percent of adult deaths in India
were traceable to health hazards related to tobacco use.
   ``Every effort should be made to make tobacco use an antisocial
habit, be it at home, at work, in public places or at social
gatherings,'' she said.
   She said treating tobacco-related cancers, cardiovascular
diseases and chronic lung diseases cost the equivalent of $1.5
billion a year, $403 million more than the government earns in
taxes and foreign exchange from tobacco sales.

   UAL Corp.'s board of directors agreed to
negotiate with United Airlines' labor unions on a proposed employee
buyout of the company and threw the bidding open to other suitors.
   In a two-paragraph statement issued Thursday after a special
meeting in New York, the board said it had directed its financial
advisers to develop a plan for selling company assets, to consider
buyout proposals from other parties and to address all other
alternatives for increasing the value of its shares.
   Chicago-based UAL is the parent of United Airlines, the nation's
second-largest carrier after American Airlines.

   The founder of 7-Eleven, a pioneer of convenience
shopping and one of the best-known store chains, said it's selling
control to a Japanese company because of crushing debts from a junk
bond-financed buyout.
   The announcement Thursday by Southland Corp., which owns 7,000
7-Elevens in the United States, is one of the most dramatic
examples yet of the problems facing U.S. companies that
participated in the junk-bond craze of the 1980s.
   Southland said it agreed to sell 75 percent of its common stock
for $400 million to Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd., Japan's second-largest
supermarket operator, and longtime Southland affiliate 7-Eleven
Japan, which Ito-Yokado controls.

president's savings and loan bailout and cost taxpayers millions of
dollars.
   The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision appealed
on Thursday an order from U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the government gets involved, can
politics be far behind?
   Maine is spending $250,000 this year promoting Mexican hot
sauce, Scottish scones and other native creations, but a small
businessman who stirs a mean brew of ``Bush Sauce'' isn't getting
any help.
   The state-run Maine Products Marketing Program publishes a
catalog of crafts made by businesses with just a handful of
employees. The state says last year's listing boosted sales by $9
million. A recently published second edition includes 130 products.
   ``The state's efforts, we feel, have been very, very
productive,'' said May Davidson, who along with her husband, Jim,
sells backyard wind chimes from North Country Wind Bells in Round
Pond.
   ``I can think of one absolutely major account that we can
attribute to them, and several other regular accounts, probably
about a dozen accounts in all,'' she said.
   Don't tell that to Paul Hagen.
   The maker of ``Bush Sauce'' _ a green-tomato concoction said to
be ``excellent with quail'' _ complains that politics kept him out
of this year's catalog.
   ``What they're doing is a pretty rotten trick,'' said Hagen,
whose one-man operation in Ogunquit churns out Bush Sauce in three
flavors: original, wicked good and kinder, gentler. ``I wonder how
they'd feel about Lincoln Logs.''
   The state explains it has prohibited religious, political or
sexually suggestive items from the catalog.
   But the new book features a picture and description of a
limited-edition miniature of President Bush's summer home on
Walker's Point in Kennebunkport that is produced by the Cheryl
Spencer-Collin Studio in Eliot.
   ``Is that right?'' Department of Economic and Community
Development spokesman Jim Thompson said Thursday. ``I didn't know
about Walker's Point. Apparently, the committee let this one go. I
don't know what the difference is.''
   The state screens entries for the catalog, which is sent to
numerous major distributors who are encouraged to buy things from
Maine. Several businesses report good results from the program.
   Judith Monroe, an author who also bakes and sells Scottish oat
scones at her Belleweather business in Hallowell, said the state
has promoted her product through the catalog and a toll-free number
stores can call, and helped with ideas on design, shipping and
pricing.
   ``I've had people call from New York and say they've gotten my
name from the Department of Agriculture,'' Ms. Monroe said.
   The Maine Department of Economic and Community Development said
the program costs $250,000 a year.
   The program also provides money to let entrepreneurs show off
their wares at out-of-state trade events, runs marketing sessions
and even helps design labels to show that products are made in
Maine.
   The catalog includes solid-wood furniture, musical instruments,
toy lobsters and other products made by the state's craftsmen.
There's even Mexican hot sauce made with pure chilis by The Mex
restaurant in Ellsworth. But not the presidential poison.
   Hagen said Bush Sauce is doing well enough on its own through a
marketing strategy that includes putting his name and address on
each bottle so people who run across the sauce can find out how to
get more.
   Democrats often send it to Republicans and vice versa, he said.
Hagen even sent a bottle to President Bush and got a thank-you note
from the White House staff.
   ``I wish he would try it on his broccoli,'' Hagen said,
referring to the president's widely publicized disdain for the
green vegetable. ``He might like it better.''

   Southland Corp.'s plan to sell control to a
Japanese company could face strong opposition from creditors who
must approve a restructuring of $1.8 billion in junk bonds and
other debt, analysts say.
   But the proposal by the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store
chain gets different views from opposite sides of the Pacific:
Japanese analysts say the deal should go smoothly while some in the
United States say it's shaky.
   ``The exchange offer ... will ensure a rapid descent toward
bankruptcy,'' said Chriss Street, a managing director with Seidler
Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.
   Southland said Thursday it agreed to sell 75 percent of its
common stock for $400 million to Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd., Japan's
second-largest supermarket operator, and longtime Southland
affiliate 7-Eleven Japan, which Ito-Yokado controls.
   7-Eleven is the world's largest convenience store chain,
offering items ranging from milk and frozen foods to newspapers,
hot coffee, video rentals and ``Slurpee'' slushed ice drinks. It
began in 1927 as a Dallas ice house.
   Southland, which sought the Japanese buyer, said the deal hinges
on the company's ability to get 32 bank creditors to restructure
terms of its outstanding preferred stock and $1.8 billion in debt.
   Much of the debt is in high-interest junk bonds used to finance
the $4.9 billion leveraged buyout by its founding Thompson family
in 1987. Under a restructuring, the debt would be exchanged for new
bonds and stock with a much lower face value.
   ``The Japanese acquisition asked the bondholders to put
themselves at tremendous risk if Southland files for bankruptcy
reorganization,'' Street said. ``It is a `trust me' situation. Bond
holders and Southland are suffering from their original
acquisition.''
   A recent court ruling limiting bondholders' claims in a
bankruptcy proceeding to the bonds' fair market value at the time
of the exchange offer will hurt the deal's acceptance by creditors,
he said.
   Mark Yim, an analyst with Baring Securities Inc. in Tokyo, said
the deal makes good sense for Ito-Yokado, which is flush with cash
after a successful introduction of point-of-sale systems for
tracking inventory at check-out counters.
   ``Their profitability is among the highest in Japan,'' Yim said.
``That is all the more remarkable because what they sell _ food _
traditionally has a lower (profit) margin. Their cash position is
very, very strong.''
   Southland, to raise money for paying debt, sold its 58 Hawaiian
stores to 7-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd. for $75 million cash last
November. 7-Eleven Japan, Japan's largest convenience-store
operator, operates 3,940 licensed stores. Ito-Yokado owns 50.3
percent of 7-Eleven Japan.
   Yim said the Japanese company and its affiliate ``could easily
finance this whole deal out of what they have right now.''
   ``We have been in a consumption boom for the past three years in
Japan and all the retailers have been doing really well,'' he said.
``The retailers have very conservative management.''
   The agreement, besides the company-owned 7-Elevens, includes
Southland's six food processing centers and five distribution
centers.
   Street said 7-Eleven, the world's largest convenience store
chain with more than 47,000 full-time employees in the United
States and Canada, is troubled not only by great debt but by an
eroding competitive position.
   ``They were great pioneers in convenience stores,'' he said.
``But in the last number of years they have been a follower rather
than a leader in serving the customer's needs.''
   Under the agreement, the family of John P. Thompson, Southland's
chairman, would retain a 15 percent stake in the company and
positions on the board of directors.
   Street said that at the time Southland borrowed $2.5 billion for
its 1987 buyout, the economic outlook was rosy during a takeover
binge.
   ``Unfortunately, in the years since, Southland has had its
competitive position eroded _ its competitive position in providing
the customer convenience,'' he said.
   Soon after the buyout, dubbed by Wall Street as the ``Texas
Chain Store Massacre,'' the company had problems meeting huge debt
payments. It attempted to raise cash partly by selling such assets
as a half-interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp., a major refiner.
   Southland lost $243.7 million in the first nine months of last
year. Company officials acknowledged last November that Southland
would not be able to meet debt payments by 1991 and was considering
a financial restructuring.

<HEAD>Thrift Adds Check Insurance to Customer Inducements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California thrift has lobbed a new grenade
in the war to lure customers into banks and savings and loans: free
insurance on many items purchased with personal checks drawn on its
accounts.
   The offer by Coast Savings is akin to services already provided
by American Express Co. and other credit card companies' ``gold
cards,'' and a small but growing number of banks.
   ``We had had to do it. There's such a fierce competition for the
checking account,'' Coast Savings President Gerrald D. Barrone said
Thursday. ``There are more branches of S&amp;Ls in the state than
supermarkets.''
   Analysts and bank and thrift officials said that if Coast
succeeds, it may well trigger a new round in the customer-service
battle.
   Since last summer, California banks have extended their Monday
through Friday hours, opened on weekends, created branches in
supermarkets and even started paying bonuses to customers if
service lags.
   ``Everybody is after market share,'' said Dan Williams, a
banking analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco. ``If (deposit
insurance) works for Coast, it may get to the point where everyone
will have to do it.''
   Barrone said a quarter of Coast's customers now have checking
accounts, about 200,000 in all. The thrift hopes to improve that
figure by 50 percent this year, taking in about $20 million a month
in new checking accounts, he said.
   Purchases included in the program and paid for in full with
Coast Savings checks are insured for 90 days against theft, loss,
accidental breakage and fire. Manufacturers' warranties are doubled
up to a year, so a 90-day warranty is good for 180 days. Claims can
be filed through a toll-free, 24-hour number.
   The program begins Monday. Some items, such as vehicles,
dwellings, coins, services, art objects, items used for business,
and consumables such as fuel and food, are excluded from coverage.
   Coast, a savings and loan with $11.2 billion in assets and 125
branches around the state, is the first major California financial
institution to provide such insurance. California's Napa Valley
Bank and Valley National Bank of Arizona offer the service.
   Barrone said Coast pays an insurance company 86 cents per year
per checking account for the insurance service.
   Checking accounts are a cheaper source of deposits than savings
accounts and certificates of deposits. Financial institutions also
try to provide multiple services to customers, and checking
accounts are a good way to cement such an approach.
   ``We try to cross-sell _ it's the old idea of offering more
services, like being a drug store instead of a pharmacy,'' Barrone
said.
   Financial services consultant Bert Ely said the country is
glutted with banks and thrifts. Coast's new program ``is taking
place in the context of an extremely competitive industry,'' Ely
said.
   Barrone said there are 56 financial institutions for every
million people in the United States, compared to one per million in
Japan and eight per million in Europe.
   Bigger banks were watching carefully.
   ``It's definitely something we're looking at and we're aware
it's gaining in popularity, but we have no plans for a similar
program at this time,'' said Kathleen Shilkret, a spokeswoman for
San Francisco's Wells Fargo Bank, which set off the rush to
extended hours last year.
   ``We currently offer the same type of program with our gold Visa
and Mastercards,'' she said.

<HEAD>Accountant Settles Charges in Pillsbury Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of accounting for a hotel corporation
has agreed to settle charges that he allegedly traded on inside
information about Grand Metropolitan PLC's bid for The Pillsbury Co.
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Stuart A. Godfrey,
agreed to pay more than $30,000 in fines and restitution, and to
cooperate with investigators.
   In a civil complaint filed in New York, the Securities and
Exchange Commission accused Godfrey, manager of corporate
accounting at Inter-Continental Hotels Corp., of buying call option
contracts on Pillsbury stock based on confidential corporate
information.
   A call option is the right to buy 100 shares of a stock at a
previously agreed-upon price by a predetermined date. Investors who
buy call options are betting that a stock's price will rise
sharply, enabling them to make a big profit on a small investment.
   Inter-Continental was a wholly owned subsidiary of Grand Met at
the time and IHC's executive offices were located in the same
building as the U.S. headquarters of Grand Met, a British food and
beverage producer.
   Grand Met acquired Pillsbury in January 1989.
   According to the SEC, Godfrey, 31, of Larchmont, N.Y., violated
his fiduciary duty to his employers when he allegedly utilized the
non-public information about the bid for Pillsbury for his own
profit.
   The SEC alleged he made $14,221 on call option contracts
purchased before Grand Met's bid for Minneapolis-based Pillsbury
was announced publicly on Oct. 4, 1988.
   Earlier this year, the SEC charged a Minneapolis lawyer, James
H. O'Hagan, with making $4.3 million in alleged illegal profits
using inside information misappropriated from his former firm,
which was representing Grand Met.
   O'Hagan has not settled with the SEC, said Harry J. Weiss, an
SEC attorney in Washington.

<HEAD>Simmons Fights Battle Over Lockheed on Lockheed Turf</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas investor Harold C. Simmons says he
likely would sell about $1 billion worth of assets in Lockheed
Corp.'s technology and electronics services businesses if he wins
control of the company.
   Though a final decision would not be made until after a review
of the company's financial records, Simmons said Thursday he
probably would pressure managers to improve profits in the
divisions, then sell unprofitable parts.
   Lockheed, the nation's sixth-largest defense concern, has
deployed more than $2 billion in assets in the technology and
electronics services divisions, which have produced scanty profits.
   Chief among the problem divisions is Sanders Inc. in Nashua,
N.H., the second-largest employer in New Hampshire, according to
Simmons and his chief lieutenant, J. Landis Martin.
   The defense electronics company was purchased by Lockheed in
1986.
   ``They spent $1.2 billion for Sanders,'' Martin said. ``That's
far too much _ 1.4 times sales and 57 times earnings.'' He said
annual return has been just 3.9 percent.
   Simmons, who heads NL Industries, a specialty chemicals concern,
is trying to unseat Lockheed's board of directors at the company's
annual meeting March 29. He contends current management has wasted
money in attempts to diversify the company away from its core
missiles, space and aeronautical divisions.
   On Thursday, Simmons took his crusade for control of Lockheed to
an airport near where the aerospace giant developed the SR-71
``Blackbird'' spy plane and stealth fighter.
   ``I don't consider myself a corporate raider. I consider myself
a corporate builder,'' said Simmons, who has spent $530 million
buying about 19 percent of Lockheed's stock and so far has lost
about $100 million on that investment.
   Despite the loss and problems facing defense contractors as
world tensions ease, Simmons maintained he was a long term investor
in Lockheed.
   He purchased his stock at an average share price of $44.
Lockheed closed Thursday up 25 cents at $35.62{ on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Simmons told reporters it was ``absolutely false'' his only
interest in Lockheed was seeing his share price rise enough to get
out without losing money. ``That's not my record,'' he said.
   The news conference, held near the super-secret ``skunk works''
where Lockheed became famous for developing secret military planes,
was the latest in a nationwide series for Simmons. He has argued
his case before securities analysts in New York and reporters in
Georgia and New England, where Lockheed is a big employer.
   Lockheed Chairman Daniel Tellep has criticized Simmons, who also
controls sugar and oil and gas servicing companies, as having no
experience in aerospace and no clear vision for Lockheed.
   Simmons contends he had no experience in earlier businesses he
purchased, but had made them profitable by concentrating on
maximizing profits instead of emphasizing sales.
   Tellep has acknowledged that Lockheed has concentrated on
increasing revenue in recent years. He has said he and his top
managers now are focusing on profits instead.

<HEAD>Infuses More Than $450 Million Into Failed Thrift</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pinnacle West Capital Corp. said it injected
about $465 million into MeraBank Federal Savings Bank and was
released from obligations from its 1986 purchase of the savings and
loan.
   Richard Snell, chairman of the $7 billion holding company, said
Thursday the transfer of funds, including interest, consisted of
about $310 million in cash and a $155 million unsecured note,
payable in 12 years.
   He said the infusion ended Pinnacle West's obligation to
MeraBank, which federal regulators seized Jan. 31.
   ``We have now put the MeraBank issue behind us. This ends a very
difficult period for Pinnacle West and our shareholders but is only
the beginning of the company's recovery plan,'' Snell said in a
statement.
   Pinnacle West bought MeraBank in December 1986. Before it got
rid of the state's largest thrift, it was forced to restructure
$676 million in debt.
   The S&amp;L, known as MeraBank before the Resolution Trust Corp.
took over, lost over $200 million in both 1988 and 1989, leading to
Pinnacle West's $551.4 million loss last year.
   Last Dec. 6, the RTC, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. agreed to release Pinnacle West
from a ``keep-well'' agreement in exchange for injecting $450
million into MeraBank to meet capital requirements.
   Snell said that before completing the infusion Thursday, the
company closed an agreement with a consortium of financial
institutions to provide long-term financing for the $310 million.
Salomon Brothers Inc. of New York served as Pinnacle West's
investment banker in the transaction.
   Pinnacle West previously had arranged interim financing through
a group of New York banks to satisfy the agreement. Those funds
were not used, Snell said.
   He added that he hoped to sell Malapai Resources Co., a
uranium-mining company, by mid-year. Divestment of Malapai would
leave Pinnacle West with just three subsidiaries, Arizona Public
Service Co., the state's largest utility, Suncor Development Co.,
and El Dorado Investment Co.

<HEAD>UAL Board To Negotiate With Unions on Employee Buyout Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. has agreed to negotiate an employee
buyout proposal with United Airlines' labor unions despite what it
calls ``serious deficiencies'' in the latest offer.
   The company's board announced the talks Thursday in a statement
issued after a special meeting in New York.
   But UAL also said the board had directed its financial advisers
to develop a plan for selling company assets. It said advisers also
should consider buyout proposals from other parties and discuss
other alternatives for increasing the value of UAL shares.
   Chicago-based United Airlines is the nation's second-largest
carrier after American Airlines. It has been the target of several
employee buyout proposals in the past three years.
   The fourth and latest proposal, for more than $3.8 billion, was
announced Monday by unions representing United's pilots, machinists
and flight attendants.
   The bid, supported by UAL's largest shareholder, Coniston
Partners, would give UAL employees, including non-union workers, 75
percent ownership of the company.
   There was no comment Thursday on the board's action from the
unions, which have joined forces as the United Employee Acquisition
Corp.
   UAL's board said the unions and Coniston had asked on Wednesday
that negotiations begin in hopes of reaching an agreement and to
avert a proxy fight threatened by Coniston.
   ``Despite serious deficiencies which the board believes exist in
the buyout proposal, including its value and financeability, the
board has instructed its advisers to enter into the requested
negotiations,'' the board said.
   Coniston principal Paul Tierney said the New York investment
group endorsed the negotations. ``The unions sent a letter
requesting (negotiations), we endorsed the letter and we think it's
worth trying,'' he said.
   As for the threatened proxy fight, he said Coniston has ``filed
materials, we have our nominees'' for a replacement board of
directors. He said the firm is waiting for the Securities and
Exchange Commission to approve the materials, probablt within 10
days.
   The board's reference to the possible sale of assets could refer
to certain United routes, UAL's 50 percent stake in a computerized
reservations system and some planes. United owns a larger portion
of its fleet of jetliners than most airlines.
   Industry analysts have speculated UAL might sell those assets as
part of a takeover defense.
   ``Asset sales are pretty much antithetical to the objectives of
the unions,'' said Samuel Buttrick, an airline analyst at Kidder
Peabody &amp; Co. in New York. ``Labor unions don't like to see chunks
of their company sold.''
   ``I think an outright rejection (of the bid) at this stage is
unlikely under the threat of a proxy fight,'' he said.
   Under the offer, shareholders would receive $150 per share in
cash, $25 in debt securities and stock in the new company.
   To help defray the cost of an acquisition, the unions are
offering wage and benefit concessions in five-year contracts that
contain no-strike clauses.
   In proposing the buyout, Coniston also threatened a proxy fight
to replace the UAL board of directors at the company's April 26
meeting. The New York investor group owns 11.8 percent of UAL's
outstanding stock.
   If the unions are successful, they likely would dump UAL
Chairman Stephen Wolf, who has irked some union leaders with his
hard-line bargaining tactics and lucrative personal compensation
arrangement.
   Airline industry analysts are divided on the chances of UAL
employees acquiring the company, which has been at the center of
control struggles for more than seven months.
   UAL stock fell $1 to $152 a share Thursday on the New York Stock
Exchange. The board's announcement was made after the market closed.

<HEAD>Smith Plans to Retire, Murdoch Exec Eldredge Named Newsweek
Publisher</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The worldwide publisher of Newsweek magazine
plans to retire at the end of the year, while a Murdoch Magazines
executive was named to head Newsweek's U.S. edition.
   Howard W. Smith said Thursday that Peter W. Eldredge, an
executive with Murdoch Magazines, would become publisher of the
U.S. edition of Newsweek on April 2.
   Eldredge and Peter Luffman, president of Newsweek International,
each will report directly to Newsweek President Alan G. Spoon, with
no new worldwide publisher to be named.
   The newsweekly, which is owned by the Washington Post Co., is in
a fierce battle with Time and U.S. News &amp; World Report for
advertising and circulation.
   Newsweek's circulation was 3.2 million at the end of 1989, which
puts it between Time at 4.3 million and U.S. News &amp; World Report at
2.2 million. Its ad revenues rose 5 percent to a record $253.8
million last year, according to a spokeswoman for the publication.
   In a telephone interview, Smith, 55, said he has worked for
Newsweek for 25 years and decided last year that ``25 years is
enough.'' He said he planned to retire to a ranch he owns in
Nacogdoches, Texas, but will remain a consultant to the magazine.
   ``Howard Smith is a one-of-a-kind,'' Spoon said in a statement.
``His contributions to Newsweek's success have been both
far-ranging and of fundamental importance. We will miss him
greatly.''
   Smith took over as worldwide publisher at Newsweek in September
1988 after running the international division for five years.
   By announcing his retirement nine months in advance, Smith will
be able to provide some guidance to Eldredge, who has been vice
president for group sales at Murdoch Magazines, a unit of News
Corp. Ltd. of Australia.
   Eldredge, 45, said he has no immediate plans to make any changes
at Newsweek. ``It is one of the best edited and best designed
publications around,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   The post of U.S. publisher has been vacant during Smith's tenure
as worldwide publisher.
   One of the problems Newsweek faces in competing for ad revenue
is that Time is one of several publications of Time Warner Inc. and
Time's ad salesmen are able to offer packages of space in all of
them.
   Washington Post Co. owns four television stations, several cable
TV systems and The Washington Post newspaper.
   ``I think there is an opportunity there'' to sell ad packages
involving two or more of those properties, Eldredge said. ``It is
something we have to explore.''
   Eldredge joined News Corp.'s U.S. publishing arm, News America
Publishing Inc., in 1984 as advertising director of New York
magazine. He was publisher of Star magazine from 1985 to 1987, and
publisher of Premiere magazine from its debut in 1987 to earlier
this year.
   Prior to joining News America, he worked at Sport, New Times and
Money magazines.

<HEAD>Spill Response Time Hasn't Improved in Year, Officials Say</HEAD>

   Response to an oil spill as big as the one
that polluted Prince William Sound, Alaska, a year ago wouldn't be
much better today than it was then, officials say.
   ``We don't believe recovery capability is where it should be,''
Larry Dietrick of the Alaska Department of Environmental
Conservation told a congressional hearing Thursday.
   C.M. Harrison, executive vice president of Exxon Corp., said his
company is concentrating on spill prevention, but also has upgraded
response procedures.
   However, he said he couldn't guarantee that an 11-million-gallon
spill, like that from the tanker Exxon Valdez on March 24, 1990,
would be fully recovered or kept off the shore.
   Walter Parker, chairman of the Alaska Oil Spill Commission, said
protection against spill damage was better in 1977 than it is now.
   The three men and Coast Guard Rear Adm. Joel Sipes appeared
before the House Interior subcommittee on water, power and offshore
energy resources, which is investigating whether any improvements
have been made since the spill.
   Dietrick said Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the company
responsible for managing spills in Prince William Sound, says it
can do a complete clean-up on a 2,000 barrel spill within 48 hours.
   ``The Department of Conservation is asking for a 48-hour cleanup
capability for a much larger minimum spill of at least 250,000
barrels,'' the size of the Exxon Valdez disaster, said Dietrick. He
said the Alaska legislature is considering a bill requiring a plan
for handling very large spills.
   More than half of the oil lost by the Exxon Valdez still soils
the waters and shores of the once-pristine sound, according to
estimates by Dietrick's department.
   Harrison said Exxon, which has already spent $2 billion trying
to restore the area, would resume clean-up in early May. He could
not estimate the final cost.
   The company official said workers would be picking up tarballs
and oil debris, diminishing oil sheens and using a process called
bioremediation through which fertilizer is applied to the shore to
enhance growth of naturally occurring organisms that speed the
breakdown of the oil.
   Harrison said other more intrusive techniques, such as spot
hot-water washing and tilling, may be used in some places. He said
the methods will require fewer workers than last year and were
recommended by scientists.
   Sipes said the Coast Guard has made a national effort to
incorporate lessons learned from the Exxon Valdez spill.
   ``The Coast Guard is installing better equipment, instituting
new procedures and increasing research and development in marine
environmental protection,'' he said.
   The controversy over whether double hulls and double bottoms on
oil tankers would be better protection against spills surfaced
during the hearing.
   ``Exxon spent $30 million to repair the hull of the Exxon Valdez
but did not include a double hull,'' Rep. James McDermott, D-Wash.,
noted.
   Harrison said the tanker was not designed originally for a
double hull and ``did not have the structural integrity to support
a double hull design.''
   A House-Senate conference committee is trying to find a
compromise between two bills on oil spill liability that have been
passed and are wrestling with the double hull-double bottom issue.
   The House version would require double hulls and double bottoms.
The Senate says other procedures of equal safety value could be
used.
   Two environmental groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council
and the Center for Marine Conservation, released separate studies
Thursday that called for tighter standards governing tankers,
pilots and tug escorts.
   The center suggested that the Coast Guard establish a network,
much like the air-traffic control system, to monitor traffic off
the Florida Keys and the central California coast and advise
mariners of danger spots so they can avoid running aground as the
Exxon Valdez did.

   The U.S. dollar was slightly lower in European
trading this morning as attention turned to other major currencies.
   Gold prices were slightly higher.
   ``There is no evidence of a trend in the dollar right now,'' one
Milan trader said.
   Traders said attention continued to focus on the weakness of the
Japanese yen. Anticipation was strong that monetary authorities
would move to shore up the Japanese currency after the market
shrugged off an increase in Japanese interest rates earlier this
week.
   Traders said the West German mark was suffering from continuing
uncertainty about the costs of German reunification.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.24 yen to a closing 155.07 yen. Later in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 155.00 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.6040, compared with $1.6015 late Thursday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning in Europe, compared with late
Thursday's rates included: 1.7050 West German marks, down from
1.7054; 1.5105 Swiss francs, down from 1.5150; 5.7490 French
francs, down from 5.7505; 1.9177 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9210;
1,256 Italian lire, up from 1,255.50, and 1.1765 Canadian dollars,
up from 1.1757.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $393.40 a troy ounce, up
from $393.05 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $393.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $393.75, up from $393 late Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 13 cents to close at a bid
$393.65.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.09 a troy ounce, from
Thursday's $5.08.

<HEAD>Victorious Hazelwood Wants to Return to Sea As a Captain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Flushed with a feeling of victory after
three acquittals and a conviction on a minor misdemeanor, Exxon
Valdez skipper Joseph Hazelwood says he longs to return to the sea
as a ship captain.
   His lawyer, Michael Chalos, said he will start negotiating with
Exxon to regain the skipper's job with the shipping company that
hired him out of college and fired him after his tanker grounded a
year ago, causing the nation's worst oil spill.
   ``I'd like to go back to the sea. That's what I do,'' Hazelwood
said Thursday after jurors absolved him of accusations he was
reckless and drunk during the disaster that blackened the rocky
shoreline of Prince William Sound.
   The misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil on which
Hazelwood was convicted carries a maximum sentence of 90 days in
jail and a $1,000 fine, far less than the 7\ years and $61,000 fine
he could have faced if found guilty on all four charges.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone set sentencing for today.
   A grand jury indicted him last year on a felony, criminal
mischief, and two other misdemeanors, reckless endangerment and
operating a vessel while intoxicated. Jurors took only 10{ hours in
deliberations to reject those counts.
   ``The state just didn't have the evidence,'' said juror Terrill
Smith, a hardware store manager.
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper told a news conference that Hazelwood's
acquittal on the most serious charges shows that someone other than
the veteran mariner was responsible for the grounding.
   ``The result bears out the fact that there are other people
responsible for this, other than Capt. Hazelwood,'' said Cowper,
who learned of the verdict Thursday while touring Prince William
Sound by helicopter.
   Alaska Attorney General Douglas Baily disputed suggestions that
the state had tried to make Hazelwood a scapegoat.
   ``It was always my view that the captain of that vessel is
ultimately responsible,'' he said.
   The normally taciturn Hazelwood smiled broadly for the first
time in the two-month trial when the verdicts were announced two
days short of the oil spill's first anniversary.
   ``I'm not used to being in the limelight,'' Hazelwood told
reporters. ``I was a pretty anonymous character until a year ago.''
   Chalos said he would fight expected efforts by the Coast Guard
to revoke Hazelwood's master's license.
   The skipper's future also is clouded by more than 100 civil
lawsuits filed by assorted victims of the nation's worst
environmental disaster.
   Jim Morakis, an Exxon spokesman in New York, said the company,
which has fired Hazelwood, was ``pleased that the ordeal of the
trial is over for Capt. Hazelwood and his family.''
   ``The verdict would seem to confirm the view that the grounding
of the Exxon Valdez was an accident,'' Morakis said. ``In light of
pending litigation any other comment would be inappropriate.''
   Another lawyer for Hazelwood, Dick Madson, said even the
misdemeanor was wrongly filed and would be appealed.
   The heart of the case against Hazelwood was alcohol, and jurors
said the state failed to prove he was drunk.
   Juror Jeff Sage, a grocery store manager, said the panel didn't
buy a prosecution expert's backward calculations which tried
proving intoxication without physical evidence. A blood test of the
skipper was taken too late to be conclusive.
   ``The jury felt there were just too many variables to pinpoint
whether he was drunk at all,'' said Sage.
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole conceded his prosecution
would have been easier if a timely blood test was taken. He said he
hoped the case had discouraged tanker captains from drinking before
they sail.
   The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, ran aground and spilled
almost 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound on March
24, 1989. It killed countless birds, fish and wildlife in the
scenic area, and Exxon came under bitter criticism for failing to
respond quickly with a clean up effort.
   Sage said jurors concluded that Hazelwood was negligent to leave
the bridge of his ship during an icy transit. But he also said they
felt that ``all his orders were prudent. He was in command.''
   ``To this day, we're never going to know exactly what caused the
accident,'' Sage said.
   But he found no fault with the state's decision to put the
skipper on trial.
   ``I think that someone had to be tried,'' he said, ``and he's
the captain. He was in charge.''

   The Internal Revenue Service blames a budget
squeeze for its inability to answer two of every three taxpayer
telephone calls for help.
   But if you can get through to the agency, you have a better
chance than last year of getting the correct answer to a tax
question. The General Accounting Office says IRS employees give the
right answer 78 percent of the time, up from 66 percent last year.
   The bad news is that only 34 percent of callers are getting
through to the IRS, down sharply from 61 percent in 1989, Jennie S.
Stathis of the congressional investigative agency told the House
Ways and Means oversight subcommittee Thursday.
   ``It bothers the hell out of me that taxpayer service has
declined that way,'' IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg testified.
He said the inability to take phone calls resulted from a decision
by the agency to cut its service _ rather than the quality _
because of a shortfall in its 1990 budget.
   He said the IRS is also getting calls from 7 percent more
taxpayers than had been expected.
   Goldberg said the IRS budget that President Bush proposed for
the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 is reasonable. He cautioned that
any reductions would harm efforts to collect $80 billion of
delinquent accounts, force more cuts in taxpayer services and lead
to further deterioration of a computer system that already has
outlived its usefulness.
   ``The only hope we have of meeting legitimate taxpayer
expectations in dealing with their government is to modernize our
systems,'' Goldberg said.
   The administration has proposed a $6.1 billion budget for the
IRS, up 12 percent from the 1990 fiscal year.
   But Goldberg said the agency is still suffering from previous
tight budgets. ``I am afraid that the tax system will continue to
pay the price of the 1989-1990 hiring freeze and failure to provide
adequate training and support for our employees for years to
come,'' he said.
   Ms. Stathis gave this rundown on how the IRS is doing this
filing season:
   _The GAO telephoned 20 tax questions to 29 IRS offices and
scored 1,261 responses; 78 percent were correct.
   _Through March 17, taxpayers had called the IRS 31.5 million
times and the IRS had picked up the phone 10.7 million times.
During a similar period last year, there were far fewer calls _
19.3 million _ but 11.8 million of them were answered.
   _Processing of returns is 12.5 percent ahead of last year's
pace; returns received are up 3.5 percent; the number of refunds is
up 16.7 percent.
   _The percentage of returns with taxpayer errors or IRS
processing mistakes is dropping, from 16 percent last year to 14
percent this year.
   _Ordering forms and publications by phone can be as troublesome
as calling with a tax question. But once a caller connects, the IRS
is prompt in mailing requested items within the promised 14 days.
The agency is not as reliable for items ordered by letter.
   Members of the subcommittee were concerned that the percentage
of taxpayers being audited has declined to only about nine per
1,000 returns this year. ``Congress may be forced to mandate a
minimum audit level,'' said Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, the panel's
chairman.
   Goldberg said that with a larger budget, the IRS might be able
to boost the current level to about 13 audits per 1,000 returns by
1993.
   He noted that about 40 million individual returns, whose incomes
are solely from wages, interest and dividends, receive the
equivalent of an audit every year through a computer matching
program.

<HEAD>Abrupt Grain Agreement Reflects Long-Term Soviet Interest in US
Trade</HEAD>

   A tentative long-term grain agreement between
the United States and the Soviet Union was reached unexpectedly and
without any last-minute major concessions from either side.
   As recently as Tuesday, reporters were told negotiators were not
expected to settle quickly on a new five-year agreement to replace
the 1983 accord that will expire Dec. 31.
   The talks were scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday in Vienna.
An earlier round last December was inconclusive.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter downplayed the
negotiations on the eve of this week's talks, indicating it was
unlikely a package would be finalized soon.
   But on Thursday, Yeutter and U.S. Trade Representative Carla A.
Hills announced in Washington that an agreement in principle had
been reached on a new five-year grain pact.
   The official signing is scheduled for June when President Bush
meets with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``They just came to agreement much quicker than anyone
anticipated,'' said Kelly Shipp, Yeutter's press secretary. ``They
were just able to wrap it up.''
   No major obstacles were suddenly overcome, nothing like that,
she said. The new agreement, in fact, tracks pretty well with the
current version.
   In December, the Soviets wanted to add grain prices to the new
pact, Shipp said. That was rejected by the U.S. negotiators. The
current agreement and those in the past omitted those prices.
   ``We've always stuck to competitive pricing or world markets,
something like that,'' she said. ``When they went into this, it was
expected there would be additional meetings.''
   Shipp said the sudden decision by Moscow to settle the grain
question suggests the Soviet Union wants to be around a long time
as a customer of the American farmer. ``They still want to be in
our long-term market,'' she said.
   Shipp said there have been rumors of growing Kremlin disinterest
in the U.S. agricultural market, partly because of financial
programs and possible commitments to other suppliers.
   The major change from the current agreement, she said, will be
to increase the annual minimum shipments of U.S. grain to the
Soviets to 10 million metric tons, from nine million tons under the
current agreement. That will guarantee 50 million tons over the
five years, compared with 45 million tons under the old terms.
   Soviet purchases in most years have exceeded the required
minimums. In 1988-89, for example, sales were more than double the
specified minimum in the current pact.
   Howard Lyman, a lobbyist for the National Farmers Union, said
the new pact was in line with the group's support of such long-term
agreements. ``We think it's great,'' he said.
   John A. Schnittker, a private analyst and consultant, questioned
whether the agreement with Moscow is needed at all. The new
version, he said, is ``a little more flexible, a little bigger''
and will provide ``some assurance and some stability'' for American
farmers.
   ``But I've never considered these agreements to be necessary for
continuation of trade,'' he said. ``In my opinion, we would be
selling just as much. They need the stuff, we've got the stuff,
they're going to buy it when they need it.''
   The Kremlin will have some greater year-to-year flexibility
under the new arrangement by being allowed to choose between wheat
and feed grains, although the minimums will have to be met over the
life of the pact, officials said.
   Under the new agreement, the Soviets are committed to buying at
least four million tons each of wheat and feed grains. However, in
any one year Moscow can substitute up to 750,000 tons of one
commodity for the other.
   Also, for the first time, the agreement includes barley and
sorghum along with corn under the definition of feed grains.
   Additional flexibility also was provided by giving Moscow
automatic permission to buy up to 14 million tons of grain annually
without further discussion with Washington.
   The automatic limit under the current pact is 12 million tons,
although the United States has routinely increased that lid to fit
Soviet needs.
   As of March 8, the Soviets had bought more than 13.8 million
tons of U.S. wheat and corn under the current agreement for
delivery this year. Last year's sales totaled a record 21.7 million
tons.
   Over five years, U.S. farmers will effectively be assured a
Soviet market for at least 20 million tons of wheat and 20 million
tons of feed grains, with an additional 10 million tons that can be
made up of wheat, feed grains, soybeans or soybean meal.
   Although it makes up a hefty share, the Soviet Union's grain
purchases by no means tell the whole story of U.S. grain exports.
Total wheat shipments in 1989-90 are currently forecast at 35.4
million tons, and so-called coarse grains, or feed grains, at 66.4
million tons.

   Cash-strapped companies laid off
thousands of workers and Brazilians deserted shops and restaurants
in the week since new President Fernando Collor de Mello's decreed
a drastic economic plan.
   The 40-year-old conservative leader, inaugurated March 15, says
his sweeping program to bring down 2,700 percent inflation is not
negotiable.
   Police stood guard in banks nationwide Thursday to ensure
clients were allowed to withdraw $1,200 from savings and $600 from
money markets, the legal limits set in the 18-month freeze on
withdrawals. Many banks said they didn't have the ready cash to
honor withdrawal requests.
   About $115 billion, or 80 percent of bank deposits, have been
frozen under the harsh plan, which has overwhelming support among
opposition leftist politicians and the public.
   ``This was the greatest blow to Brazil's elite since the slaves
were freed (in 1889), and the slaveowners weren't indemnified,''
Rio's best known gossip columnist, Ibrahim Sued, wrote in Globo
newspaper.
   ``If we had won and done this, the presidential palace would
have been surrounded, and many people, including me, would be
headed for exile,'' Rep. Roberto Freire, the Brazilian Communist
Party candidate in the Nov. 15 presidential election.
   The money crunch caused a steep drop in business activity.
Restaurants and stores were almost deserted and cash-strapped
companies fired workers in droves. Collor de Mello warned that
companies firing workers would have account books examined by
federal tax investigators.
   In the southern state of Parana, 19,000 construction workers
were laid off this week while scores of employees in the auto
parts, banking and weapons industries have been fired or forced to
take early holidays.
   All week clients formed long lines outside banks nationwide to
withdraw their legal limit from savings and money market accounts.
   At least five bank managers have been arrested since Wednesday
for setting withdrawal limits below the legal maximum. They were
charged with ``white collar'' crimes, punishable under the new
measures by up to six years in jail.
   In Sao Paulo, several supermarket owners were also arrested for
disobeying the plan's 30-day price freeze.
   The emergency plan, decreed by Collor on his first full day in
office, also included a new currency, steep income tax increases
and drastic spending cuts to eliminate a budget deficit.
   Collor also limited payments on the country's $115 billion
foreign debt _ the largest in the developing world _ to $5 billion
this year. The $5 billion is about half the amount paid in 1989.
   Union leaders are worried by the layoffs and Collor's promise to
sell state companies to the private sector. They also say workers'
buying power will be slashed by below-inflation increases.
   Earlier this week, 1,000 workers marched through downtown Rio
demanding job protection and a bigger pay boost.
   The measures take effect immediately but must be approved by
Congress within 30 days, with a 30-day extension possible. Congress
has begun discussing the package and by Thursday, more than 1,000
amendments had been offered.
   Collor said he will not back down. ``Either we win ... or we
win,'' he said.
   While about half of all congressmen unofficially back Collor,
the president's National Reconstruction Party has only 24 seats in
the 570-member Congress and will be forced to seek alliances. Most
members are up for re-election in October.
   ``The poor are demanding I vote for the package but the middle
class will kill me if I do,'' said Rep. Luiz Henrique of the
centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, the largest party in
Congress with 189 of 570 seats.
   ``We don't accept that the plan is untouchable. It should be
preserved in general but Congress has the competence and authority
to make changes,'' said Robson Marinho of the center-left Brazilian
Social Democracy Party, Congress' third-largest.
   He said his party would work to increase limits on withdrawals
from bank accounts, support a larger wage increase and demand the
government prevent wide layoffs. Congressional leaders said would
back such modifications.
   In addition, a half-dozen lawsuits have been filed against the
government by people who say the confiscation of savings accounts
represents a ``compulsory loan,'' outlawed by Brazil's 1988
constitution.
   ``The plan is unconstitutional.'' said Marcio Thomaz Bastos,
former head of the Brazilian Bar Association.

   The Boeing Co. plans to issue layoff notices to
about 360 hourly workers today, well below the 1,700 employees the
company had said would be furloughed by this month.
   The company did not explain why the figure was significantly
smaller. Two weeks ago Boeing had warned 600 employees that they
might lose their jobs.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said some affected employees may
have already left their jobs or found work elsewhere at the
company, adding that Boeing's overall forecast for cutting 5,000
jobs this year has not changed.
   Boeing has said the layoffs are needed to increase production
efficiencies at its Everett plant and because of the decrease in
federal defense spending.
   Separately, Boeing announced on Thursday plans to expand its
commercial jet plant in Everett by more than 4 million square feet
over the next decade.
   The 747 jumbo jets and 767 widebodies are currently assembled
there. Boeing is considering assembling its new 777 jet there.

<HEAD>Ingersoll Newspaper To Buy Back Junk Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ingersoll Newspapers Inc. has offered to
buy back $159 million of its junk bonds at discounted prices as it
tries to meet interest payments.
   Ingersoll Newspapers offered Thursday to buy the bonds at
between 25 percent and 55 percent of the principal amount.
   One series of bonds has been trading at about $400 per $1,000 in
face value. A separate series is trading at about $200 per $1,000.
   Ingersoll Newspapers is a subsidiary of Ingersoll Publications
Inc. Its properties include the weekly St. Louis Suburban Journals,
the Try (N.Y.) Record and several other medium-sized papers.
   Community Newspapers operates newspapers mostly in monopoly,
medium-sized markets, inclduing the Lorain (Ohio) Journal outside
Cleveland.
   Junk bond analyst Ned Zachar of Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago
said Ingersoll, like other newspaper companies in the northeastern
United States, is facing financial problems from an overall
economic slowdown. Ingersoll spokesman Mark Harnett said earnings
have fallen off.
   Zachar said bondholders should accept some kind of offer to
avoid pushing the publishing company into bankruptcy, but he
expected a higher purchase price to result from any negotiations.
   ``I think there's a pretty good chance Ingersoll will suceed
with a tender offer,'' he said. ``But whether it will be at this
price or another remains to be seen. The bondholders will likely
push for a little more.''

<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge said availability
of cash and credit is the key to a New York investment group's $650
million bid to restructure financially ailing Allegheny
International Inc.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Joseph Cosetti said Thursday he likely
will approve Japonica Partners' plan for to acquire the company,
rather than a $570 million bid by the company's managers, if
Japonica can deliver the money.
   Pittsburgh-based Allegheny International, which makes Sunbeam
and Oster appliances, is operating under Chapter 11 protection from
its creditors.
   Japonica proposes paying creditors and shareholders in cash. The
partnership has said it has a $120 million line of credit.
   The management bid, meanwhile, would pay off creditors and
shareholders with stock in a reorganized company. Company spokesman
Edward Romanoff said the managers received a $250 million loan
commitment from Chemical Bank of New York.
   Cosetti told lawyers for creditors he would ``vote for the cash
plan because that's what most of you seem to want.''
   The judge, however, questioned whether Japonica could obtain
financing.
   ``I have reservations about whether any American banks are going
to raise money for a corporation that's been in bankruptcy for two
years,'' Cosetti said.
   The court has approved the management plan and the company has
sent it to stockholders for a vote. Cosetti said the court will
allow stockholders to vote on Japonica's plan even if the first
vote has been tallied.
   An investment arm of PNC Financial Corp., a Pittsburgh
bank-holding company, has agreed to contribute to Japonica's bid as
well but in an unspecified amount.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government has given Japan a list of more
than 200 suggested policy changes aimed at eliminating barriers
faced by foreign firms operating in Japan, a news report said
Friday.
   Quoting unidentified U.S. government officials, the nationally
circulated newspaper Asahi Shimbun said the list included
recommendations ranging from an increase in public works spending
to the release of the minutes of business group meetings.
   The newspaper said the proposals were more detailed and
far-reaching than the Japanese side had expected and amounted to a
plan to ``remake Japan.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe declined to comment
during a regular news conference Friday.
   The newspaper said the recommendations were presented as part of
talks, begun last year, concerning the bilateral trade imbalance.
   The United States has called for tighter enforcement of Japan's
Anti-Monopoly Law, controls on high land prices and higher public
works spending.
   The list of recommendations included proposals to consolidate
the 13 government offices that deal with land policy, the creation
of a special antitrust division to strengthen enforcement of the
Anti-Monopoly Law and abolising legislation that protects small
shops from competition, the newspaper said.
   Also included was a proposal to reduce the amount of shares that
banks or trading companies can hold in outside firms in order to
weaken the close financial links within Japanese business groups,
it said.
   Japanese media have reported that the government has responded
to some U.S. requests, but no formal agreements have been
announced. The United States is pressuring Japan to take action
before an April deadline for the release of an interim report
detailing progress made in the talks.

   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries apparently is considering moving a key conference from
Vienna to Geneva, after the Austrian government canceled a meeting
last week with the Iraqi oil minister to protest the execution of a
British journalist.
   The journalist, Iranian-born Farzad Bazoft, was executed in Iraq
March 15 after he was found guilty of espionage by a tribunal. His
execution drew outrage and protests from around the world.
   Iraq is one of OPEC's largest oil producers.
   There was no official comment from OPEC, but a source close to
the organization said it was ``very, very likely'' the ministerial
conference on May 25 would be shifted to Geneva, where the cartel
often holds its meetings.
   The source, who demanded anonymity, said Algerian Mines Minister
Sadek Boussena, who serves as OPEC's president, has to make a
request to other ministers to approve a change in the meeting site.
   Earlier in the week, Ecuador's oil minister, Diego Tamariz, said
the ministers had decided at their weekend talks to hold the
mid-year conference in the Swiss city. He gave no reason.
   The effort to move the meeting was apparently sparked by the
Austrian government's snub of Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdul Raheem
al-Chalabi, according to the source.
   A scheduled meeting with him by Austrian Trade Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel was canceled last week without explanation.
   Chalabi was in Vienna for a meeting on Friday and Saturday of a
special monitoring panel of the 13 OPEC nations.
   The cartel's headquarters is in Vienna but it often holds its
meetings in other European cities. It had announced at its
ministerial conference last November that the May meeting would
take place in the Austrian capital.
   At that meeting, the oil ministers will decide their production
and pricing guidelines for the last six months of the year.
   OPEC meetings, which attract hundreds of oil traders, analysts
and journalists, are lucrative for cities hosting the sessions.

<HEAD>Colt Strikers Rejoice After State Steps in to Aid Buyout</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Unbroken after a four-year strike,
workers from Colt's firearms division rejoiced when the state
joined in a buyout that ends the strike and gives workers $13
million in back pay.
   State Treasurer Francisco L. Borges announced the terms of the
buyout Thursday to a room packed with reporters, investors and
union officials. The state joined with striking workers, Colt
managers and private investors to buy the firearms division, which
had been up for sale for 11 months.
   Borges said the state would contribute $25 million from pension
funds and would own about 47 percent of the new company, which will
be called Colt's Manufacturing Company.
   ``Let me emphasize that this is a carefully thought out,
carefully structured, potentially very profitable business
venture,'' Borges said. ``The state's participation is not a
bailout, not a handout, and not a subsidy.''
   The new company's first official act was to write out a check
for $10 million in back pay to the 1,050 workers who struck Jan.
24, 1986. About 50 striking workers broke out in applause when the
company produced the check at a news conference in Borges' office.
   Under the terms of the buyout, striking workers will be put back
to work based on seniority, and will receive a total of $13 million
in back pay, a 13 percent wage increase, and a stock ownership plan
that will allow United Auto Workers members to own 11.5 percent of
the company.
   In return for the $13 million in back pay, the United Auto
Workers dropped its lawsuit against Colt Industries for unfair
labor practices.
   The National Labor Relations Board said the settlement was the
largest in its 55-year history. The previous high was a $12 million
settlement given in 1979 to chemical plant workers in Westwego,
La., who had been unlawfully locked out of their jobs for three
years.
   Salaried Colt managers will own about 12 percent of the company,
as will C.F. Holding Corp., an investment group headed by Hartford
businessman Anthony Autorino.
   Neither Borges nor Autorino would release the total amount paid
for the firearms division. Autorino said the final amount remains
subject to negotiations with Colt Industries. Borges said his
office will eventually release the total cost.
   The agreement came 11 months after Colt Industries put its
firearms division up for sale. At the time, the division was
ravaged by a three-year-old strike, and had just lost the contract
to produce M-16 rifles for the Pentagon.
   With no buyer in sight, the striking workers won a major victory
in September 1989 when an administrative law judge from the
National Labor Relations Board ruled that the strike was caused by
Colt's unfair labor practices. The judge ordered the company to
reinstate the workers and pay them lost wages, which were estimated
as high as $40 million.
   In November, Connecticut-based C.F. Holding Corp. announced it
had signed an agreement to buy the firearms division. There was no
mention at the time of union ownership or a state contribution, but
both were expected to be part of a final agreement.
   Union leaders praised the agreement and said they expected their
members to resume working next week. Union members will replace
approximately 600 non-union replacement workers.
   The strike began when workers walked off the job after working
10 months without a contract. Eight months into the strike, the
workers offered to return under the terms of their old contract,
but Colt refused.
   Colt was founded in Hartford in 1836 by Samuel Colt, the
inventor of the first successful repeating pistol. The company
later developed the six-shooter _ the legendary gun that won the
West.
   In addition to the M-16, the standard Army-issue rifle still
used today, Colt makes the Colt 45 handgun, the King Cobra magnum
revolver and the AR-15 rifle.
   In announcing its intention to sell the firearms division in
April 1989, Colt Industries said it wanted to concentrate its
efforts on its aerospace, automotive and industrial service
operations.

<HEAD>GM's New Minivans Get Incentives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is offering a $1,000 rebate
on its new line of three minivans just four months after the
vehicles were introduced.
   The rebates, along with a sliding scale of low-interest
financing, became effective Thursday and run until May 2 for the
Chevrolet Lumina APV, Pontiac Trans Sport or Oldsmobile Silhouette.
   Typically, incentives are offered on cars or trucks whose
inventories rise because of slow sales, overproduction or a
combination of both. None of these reasons, however, seems to be
the case with the GM minivans.
   ``I have heard that they are selling relatively well,'' said
senior economist Tom Webb of the National Automobile Dealers
Association in McLean, Va.
   Production at GM's minivan plant in North Tarrytown, N.Y., still
is accelerating toward a goal of about 175,000 vehicles this year
and 225,000 after that.
   When asked why GM would offer a rebate on something selling
well, Webb said, ``Good question.''
   Yet dealer Herb Adcox, owner of Herb Adcox Chevrolet in
Chattanooga, Tenn., likes the incentives. He estimated that he had
a Lumina APV supply of about 75 selling days on his lot, mainly
because of a recent large purchase.
   ``I felt like once they got production up, you were going to get
an incentive,'' he said Thursday. ``The numbers just justify it.''
   GM's minivans went on sale last October. Since then, GM has sold
30,891 of them, with the Chevrolet model making up more than half.
   ``We could see that there is a need in today's market to have
incentives on just about anything,'' Pontiac spokesman Ed Lechtzin
said. ``Because people are coming in and like the vehicle, but look
at the price and say, `How much (rebate) money am I getting?'''
   Lechtzin said there was some concern that production at the
plant may outpace demand. But Oldsmobile spokesman Ross Ruehle said
the sales demand is a little stronger than anticipated for the
Silhouette.
   Chrysler Corp., whose minivan sales command more than half of
the vehicle's market segment, offered rebates on the vehicles for
the first time between Dec. 15, 1989, and Jan. 31, 1990.
   Sales of the Plymouth Voyager, Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town
and Country soared during the incentive period. Since then, the
minivan sales pace has dropped.
   ``What we think is we have been out there trying to sell
something up against someone with an incredible rebate,'' said
Chevrolet spokeswoman Mary McElyea.
   Ford Motor Co. is offering a $500 rebate on its Aerostar
minivan. That offer expires April 2.

   A Northwest Airlines pilot fell out of his
barroom chair and couldn't find his motel the night before he and
two others in his cockpit crew were arrested on suspicion of flying
while intoxicated, authorities say.
   The three, who have been fired by Northwest, were charged
Thursday by federal and state officials with operating an aircraft
while under the influence of alcohol.
   Charges were filed by the U.S. attorney's office in Minneapolis
and by North Dakota officials against Capt. Norman Prouse, 51, of
Conyers, Ga.; First Officer Robert Kirchner, 35, of Highland Ranch,
Colo., and Second Officer Joseph Balzer, 34, of Antioch, Tenn.
   Prouse, Balzer and Kirchner piloted Flight 650 from Fargo, N.D.,
to Minneapolis with 91 passengers on March 8 and landed safely.
However, federal authorities had received a tip that the crew had
been drinking the night before the flight and the three were
arrested when they got off the plane.
   According to an FBI agent's affidavit, Prouse bought 14 rum
drinks at a Moorhead bar over about six hours the evening before
the flight left Fargo, and another patron bought five additional
drinks for him. The affidavit said the other two crew members were
served seven pitchers of beer.
   Witnesses said Prouse fell out of his chair and had trouble
getting up, and he returned to the bar about 20 minutes after
leaving, saying he was lost and could not find the nearby motel
where the crew was staying, the affidavit said.
   ``Balzer appeared to have had difficulty focusing his vision and
both Kirchner and Balzer were unable to walk steadily,'' the
affidavit said.
   Tests taken soon after the three were taken into custody showed
they had blood-alcohol levels ranging from 0.06 percent to 0.12
percent, Arnold's office said. Federal regulations prohibit pilots
from flying if they have alcohol levels higher than 0.04 percent.
The legal limit for driving a vehicle is 0.10 in most states.
   The three pilots are scheduled to be arraigned Thursday on the
federal felony charges of operating a common carrier while under
the influence of alcohol or drugs. The maximum penalty is 15 years
in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   In North Dakota, the three were charged in Cass County Court in
Fargo with operating an aircraft while intoxicated and acting as an
aircraft crew member within eight hours of drinking. The charges
are misdemeanors punishable by a $1,000 fine and one year in prison
under North Dakota law.
   The Federal Aviation Administration has revoked the men's pilot
licenses. The three plan to appeal their license revocations, their
attorneys have said.
   Mark McDermott, Kirchner's attorney, said he will ``do whatever
we have to do to defend his rights.''
   Bruce Hanley, Balzer's attorney, said his client will plead
innocent. He said it was too early to comment on the allegations in
the government's affidavit.
   Prouse has an unlisted telephone number and could not be reached
for comment.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. commerce secretary on
Friday predicted that reforms in Eastern Europe will have a
favorable impact on the U.S. trade deficit in the coming decade.
   But Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said an immediate impact will
be limited due to the lack of hard currency available to Eastern
European countries.
   ``Short term, they don't have the hard currency to do a huge
amount of buying,'' Mosbacher said.
   But the goal is to globalize free trade and integrate all
geographic regions into one trading family.
   Mosbacher said newly opened markets in Eastern Europe could help
``bring us very close to a trade balance.''
   Mosbacher declined to discuss prospects for the dollar but noted
that the U.S. currency is just one component of the trade equation.
   Mosbacher also forecast the U.S. economy will become
increasingly less dependent on defense-related industries because
of East-West disarmament. He said non-defense exports would have a
growing role.
   Separately, he said Western nations could reach an accord as
early as June on relaxing restrictions on the sale of
high-technology goods to Eastern Europe.
   Mosbacher said he and West German Economics Minister Helmut
Haussmann have agreed there must be ``differentiation'' on COCOM
restrictions for East European countries and those applied to the
Soviet Union.
   COCOM is the acronym for the 17-nation Coordinating Committee
for Multilateral Export Controls that restricts Western
high-technology exports to East bloc countries.

   UAL Corp.'s board of directors said today it
would allow former suitor Marvin Davis to again purchase UAL stock,
raising the possibility of a rival buyout offer to the $3.8 billion
bid by the company's unions.
   UAL's board on Thursday agreed to negotiate over the proposal by
United Airlines' labor unions and an investor group, despite what
it called ``serious deficiencies'' in the offer.
   The board also instructed management to explore other
alternatives for increasing its share values, including buyout
proposals from other parties, and directed its financial advisers
to develop a plan for selling company assets.
   Today, the board said it had modified a standstill agreement
with Davis, the Los Angeles billionaire who last year made a buyout
offer for UAL, to permit him to purchase UAL stock.
   Rob Doughty, UAL spokesman, said he could not elaborate on a
brief statement the company issued announcing the move. Davis
spokeswoman Mary Conway in New York also had no comment and neither
would say if Davis had a new buyout offer on the table.
   UAL stock jumped $4.37{ higher to $156.37{ in mid-day New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   In January, the board said it would consider offers from Davis,
but the agreement had blocked him from purchasing stock. Also in
January, the board lifted an agreed-to restriction that would have
kept Davis from making an offer at less than $300 a share.
   Davis opened bidding in the long-running battle for UAL last
August with an unsolicited offer, which was not accepted, of $200 a
share or $4.32 billion. The company later accepted a $300 a share
offer valued at $6.75 billion from a group led by United's pilots
union and senior management, but the deal collapsed for lack of
financing.
   Chicago-based United Airlines is the nation's second-largest
carrier after American Airlines. It has been the target of several
employee buyout proposals in the past three years.
   The fourth and latest proposal, for more than $3.8 billion, was
announced Monday by unions representing United's pilots, machinists
and flight attendants.
   The bid, supported by UAL's largest shareholder, Coniston
Partners, would give UAL employees, including non-union workers, 75
percent ownership of the company.
   There was no comment Thursday on the board's action from the
unions, which have joined forces as the United Employee Acquisition
Corp.
   UAL's board said the unions and Coniston had asked on Wednesday
that negotiations begin in hopes of reaching an agreement and to
avert a proxy fight threatened by Coniston.
   ``Despite serious deficiencies which the board believes exist in
the buyout proposal, including its value and financeability, the
board has instructed its advisers to enter into the requested
negotiations,'' the board said.
   Coniston principal Paul Tierney said the New York investment
group endorsed the negotations. ``The unions sent a letter
requesting (negotiations), we endorsed the letter and we think it's
worth trying,'' he said.
   As for the threatened proxy fight, he said Coniston has ``filed
materials, we have our nominees'' for a replacement board of
directors. He said the firm is waiting for the Securities and
Exchange Commission to approve the materials, probably within 10
days.
   The board's reference to the possible sale of assets could refer
to certain United routes, UAL's 50 percent stake in a computerized
reservations system and some planes. United owns a larger portion
of its fleet of jetliners than most airlines.
   Industry analysts have speculated UAL might sell those assets as
part of a takeover defense.
   ``Asset sales are pretty much antithetical to the objectives of
the unions,'' said Samuel Buttrick, an airline analyst at Kidder
Peabody &amp; Co. in New York. ``Labor unions don't like to see chunks
of their company sold.''
   ``I think an outright rejection (of the bid) at this stage is
unlikely under the threat of a proxy fight,'' he said.
   Under the offer, shareholders would receive $150 per share in
cash, $25 in debt securities and stock in the new company.
   To help defray the cost of an acquisition, the unions are
offering wage and benefit concessions in five-year contracts that
contain no-strike clauses.
   In proposing the buyout, Coniston also threatened a proxy fight
to replace the UAL board of directors at the company's April 26
meeting. The New York investor group owns 11.8 percent of UAL's
outstanding stock.
   If the unions are successful, they likely would dump UAL
Chairman Stephen Wolf, who has irked some union leaders with his
hard-line bargaining tactics and lucrative personal compensation
arrangement.
   Airline industry analysts are divided on the chances of UAL
employees acquiring the company, which has been at the center of
control struggles for more than seven months.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were lower in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, largely
reflecting profit-taking after the strong gains posted earlier this
week.
   Soybeans were under addditional pressure from indications of
increased crushing activity during the week. Soybeans are crushed
to produce soybean meal and soybean oil.
   Forecasts for precipitation this weekend in the Midwest weighed
on both the corn and soybean markets amid speculation that soil
moisture levels will improve.
   Further selling in the corn market was linked to disappointment
that the Soviet Union has not been a recent buyer of U.S. corn. In
fact, Thursday's weekly Agriculture Department export sales report
showed that the Soviets canceled a purchase of 32,500 metric tons
of corn
   Export demand for wheat also has been sluggish.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 2 cents lower
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.56} a bushel; corn was
\ cent to 1 cent lower with May at $2.58 a bushel; oats were { cent
to 1{ cents lower with May at $1.48\ a bushel; soybeans were 4
cents to 6 cents lower with May at $5.99 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were narrowly mixed while pork futures were
mostly higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .03 cent lower to .10 cent higher with April at
76.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .08 cent
higher with March at 82.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent
lower to .10 cent higher with April at 53.10 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .20 cent to .50 cent higher with May at 51.80
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Thursday.

<HEAD>New US-Japan Trade Proposal Would Open Door to Supercomputer Sales</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Combines pvs; no pickup; moved general news wires also.</NOTE>

   The United States has gained major concessions
from the Japanese that should boost sales of American-made
supercomputers to Japan, U.S. officials said today.
   Officials at the U.S. Trade Office said that negotiators from
both sides bargained late into the night Thursday, hammering out
details of the proposal.
   The announcement represented the first breakthrough on a host of
contentious trade disputes between the two countries.
   The dispute over sales of supercomputers centered around
American demands that the Japanese remove various restrictions that
effectively barred U.S. companies from selling supercomputers to
Japanese universities and government agencies.
   ``If implemented, we think this will give us full and effective
access to the Japanese government market,'' said Timothy O'Leary,
an official at the U.S. Trade Office.
   Under the agreement reached during two days of talks in
Washington, the Japanese promised to open up the procurement
process for supercomputers to foreign firms and to base government
decisions on purchases on quality as well as price.
   The market for supercomputers was one of three areas targeted
last year when the Bush administration put Japan on a ``hit list''
of countries with the most onerous barriers to the sale of American
products. Talks have also been proceeding on the two other products
on the list _ U.S. satellites and lumber products.
   But negotiators on those issues have reported that both sides
remain far apart on American demands to open up those markets.
   Still, there have been reports from Tokyo that Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu is preparing an array of trade concessions
in these areas as well.
   Kaifu and President Bush met last month in California for a
hastily arranged summit meeting where both leaders pledged to make
greater efforts to reduce America's huge $49 billion trade deficit
with Japan.
   Access to the government supercomputer market has long been a
point of contention between the two countries. U.S. firms, in
particular Cray Research Inc., have dominated the market for the
sophisticated machines around the world but have been unable to
sell their products to the Japanese government.
   U.S. negotiators estimated that the potential for sales to the
Japanese government was about $130 million annually.
   Dennis McGrath, a spokesman for Cray, said his company would
withhold its comment until reviewing the details of the agreement.
   ``We hope this is more than just a process thing, but something
that will translate into sales in the marketplace,'' McGrath said.
   The Japanese are under pressure to make concessions on
satellites, supercomputers and wood products before a June 16
deadline, at which time the Bush administration has the authority
to retaliate by imposing higher tariffs on Japanese products.
   The talks on specific industries are being conducted under a
section of the 1988 trade law known as Super 301. The
administration is also conducting discussions on broader structural
impediments to trade.
   Negotiators on these issues met at a remote hideaway in the
Virginia countryside earlier this week in hopes of making progress
in advance of more formal discussions scheduled for Washington on
April 2 and 3. However, U.S. officials said the discussions near
Warrenton, Va., had failed to make any progress.

   The stock market was higher at midday today,

   In a town where the pork barrel is considered
a treasured commodity, one consumer group says producers and
advertisers of ham, bacon and sausage are going too far.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest said Thursday that
it wants the federal government to halt advertising by the National
Pork Producers Council it says is ``deceptive and dangerously
misleading.''
   It filed a petition today with the Federal Trade Commission
challenging various ad claims that pork is low in fat, low in
cholesterol and low in calories.
   The center said the industry's 3-year-old campaign touting pork
as ``the other white meat'' is misleading because it claims pork
``is as nutritious as chicken, turkey and fish.''
   To that, Barry Pfouts, director of marketing for the council,
replied: ``We're confident that our advertising is accurate and can
be backed up by substantial scientific evidence.''
   ``All we have said all along is that our products ... are
nutritionally comparable to other accepted white meats,'' he added.
   Bruce Silverglade, legal director for the science center, said,
``The pork industry is trying to dupe consumers into thinking that
pork is as healthful as chicken, turkey and fish. However,
government data show that almost all cuts of pork are considerably
higher in fat, saturated fat and calories.''
   The amount of cholesterol in a four-ounce serving of cooked pork
is virtually the same for similar servings of chicken and turkey,
Charles Mitchell, a spokesman for the consumer group, acknowledged.
   But Mitchell said the amount and percentage of fat and the
number of calories is substantially higher for pork.
   He said four ounces of pork, trimmed of all visible fat,
averaged 14.8 grams or 13 percent fat, while an identical serving
of skinless chicken averages 8.4 grams or 7.4 percent fat. Turkey
weighed in at 2.9 grams or 2.6 percent fat per serving, according
to Mitchell.
   Similar servings of pork, chicken and turkey contain 264
calories, 215 calories and 171 calories, respectively, said
Mitchell.
   The science center said the ads also violate Agriculture
Department requirements that average servings of ``low-fat'' foods
must be 10 percent or less fat to make the claim.
   Pfouts, of the pork producers council, said the average
three-ounce serving of tenderloin, the best cut of pork, has about
the same 140 calories as a similar serving of skinless white-meat
chicken.
   And Mike Simpson, executive vice president of the National Pork
Board, said nutritional assessments of pork are based on
10-year-old data that don't take into account recent research and
improvements in breeding.
   The consumer group said that in addition to filing the FTC
petition, it will ask Congress to pressure the industry to increase
its spending on research to reduce fat in pork.
   Money for the pork advertising comes primarily from the
approximately $25 million collected annually from producers under
the 1987 Pork Promotion and Research Act.
   The science center contended that 70 percent of the money is
spent on advertising and other promotional activities, and just 10
percent is spent on research that could lead to ``safe, low-fat and
good-tasting products.''
   Simpson responded that in the early years of the program the
council may have spent that much on promotion. But in the 1990
budget of $26 million, promotion takes up 55 percent, research is
19 percent and consumer information is 26 percent, he said.

<TEXT>
   A suburban Cleveland publisher has filed a $10
million lawsuit against The New York Times Co., contending its
trademark rights were violated when a Times' subsidiary used the
name ``NOW'' for some new magazines.
   The civil complaint by Mall Network Publications Inc. was filed
Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Cleveland against The New York
Times Co. and two of its companies, The New York Times Co. Magazine
Group and The Family Circle Inc.
   Family Circle recently launched ``Family Circle NOW!'' which it
described as a ``new concept in women's magazines'' that involves
publication of a series of single-subject magazines on topics such
as cooking and outdoor living.
   But Mall Network of Beachwood said in its complaint that it
obtained a registered trademark for the title ``NOW'' in 1987 for a
fashion and lifestyle magazine the Ohio company publishes.
   The suit asks for $10 million in punitive damages and for orders
barring the Times from promoting and selling the ``NOW'' magazines.
   June Golden of Family Circle's public relations department
deferred questions to the parent company.
   Nancy Nielsen, spokeswoman for The New York Times Co., said she
could not comment because she had not seen the lawsuit.
   Mall Network said the first edition of the new Family Circle
publicationspping
malls, direct mailing and newspaper inserts, is more than 7 million.

<HEAD>Boeing Seeks Shareholder OK To Double Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. is seeking sharegholder approval
to more than double the number of outstanding common shares to 600
million, but the company said in its proxy statement that it has no
immediate plan to issue more stock.
   Boeing has 230.6 million common shares outstanding.
   ``What they're doing is a little long-range housekeeping,'' said
Paul Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
New York. ``They're approving authorization just in case they want
to use it at a later date.''
   Shareholders and the board of directors will vote on the
proposal at the company's annual meeting on April 30.
   Bill Whitlow, Dain Bosworth's aerospace analyst in Seattle, said
the authorization would given Boeing greater financial flexibility
and bolster its already formidable hostile-takeover defenses.
   The additional shares could be issued, if needed, to dilute the
holdings of a hostile party. ``It would give them one more
weapon,'' he said.
   Less than a year ago the stock split 3 for 2. Even though the
stock has reached that level, Boeing probably will not split it for
at least another year, Nisbet predicted.
   A split reduces the value of each share but it doesn't reduce
shareholders' investment position. The lower price for each share
following splits generally opens up investment in a company to a
broader range of investors.
   Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst with UBS Securities in New York,
said Boeing usually likes to split its stock or float some sort of
financing issue when it gets ready to launch a new airplane.
   Boeing is expected to decide by this summer whether to build its
proposed new 777 wide-bodied airliner.
   In its proxy statement, Boeing said a stock sale could be used
to obtain additional funds, allow the company to acquire other
companies, or adopt additional employee compensation plans.
   The proxy also noted the 1989 salaries of the company's leading
executives. Chairman and Chief Executive Frank Shrontz was paid
$910,000, a 7 percent increase over his 1988 wage.

   Stock prices closed sharply higher Friday on
London's Stock Exchange, propelled by a burst of buying when a new
two-week trading account opened.
   Market watchers said investors were hesitant to sell stock,
fearing that the slightest bit of good news would push prices even
higher.
   Institutions came in from the sidelines when the new account
started at midafternoon, dealers said. The exchange divides trading
into two-week and three-week periods for accounting purposes.
   Investors were encouraged by the market's ability to weather
turbulence in recent weeks and by a robust performance by the pound
Friday.
   Some shortages of blue-chip stocks and aggressive buying in
stock index futures also were positive influences.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 25
points, or 1.1 percent, at 2,283.9 at the close. That was its best
level for the day and was well above the early morning low of
2,264.1.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 16 points at 1,795.1
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 11.22 points
to close at 1,235.09.
   Volume amounted to a relatively strong 440.5 million shares,
although it was down a bit from 500.9 million shares Thursday.

<HEAD>General Mills Begins Food Delivery Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Mills Inc. has begun an
experimental business delivering casual foods such as chicken
wings, roast chicken and sandwiches to customers ordering by
telephone.
   Called Bringer's, the service is provided only to people who
live in southwest Minneapolis and parts of suburban Edina,
Richfield and Bloomington.
   The Bringer's venture fits the General Mills strategy of
experimenting with concepts for several years before launching them
nationally. The company recently opened a Chinese restaurant in
Orlando, Fla., called China Coast, which industry analysts say
eventually could parallel its successful Italian chain, Olive
Garden.
   General Mills also owns the Red Lobster restaurant chain and
markets consumer food products, including Big G cereals and Betty
Crocker bakery mixes.
   The company said Bringer's is strictly an exploratory venture
and it has no plans for expansion now.
   ``But we would never be this far if we thought the only place we
could be successful was in a pocket of the Twin Cities,'' said
Craig Shulstad, a company spokesman.
   Bringer's is General Mills' second try at finding a business
strategy to serve dual-income families who don't have the time or
energy to cook at home or go to a restaurant. Its first attempt,
the Order Inn, ended in 1988 after a year's trial.
   While Bringer's is similar to the Order Inn, there are distinct
differences that demonstrate what General Mills learned through its
first effort.
   Order Inn was designed to deliver restaurant-style food to
people's homes. The menu items were more expensive, including
grilled salmon and prime rib, and they were delivered cold in
refrigerated vans for reheating at home.
   Bringer's will supply food hot and its offerings are decidedly
more plebeian, with prices to match.
   ``Everything we know says that's where the American public is
headed,'' said Gary Rodkin, president of Bringer's and a vice
president of General Mills. ``Casual dining and convenience seem to
be two trends that are very apparent and we believe we have the
right kind of menu to serve those needs.''
   By late April, customers will be able to go to Bringer's
take-out store in the Centennial Lakes shopping center in Edina to
pick up food to take home. The local phone number for the delivery
service is 941-FOOD.

   Car and light-truck sales by the nation's Big
Three automakers fell 12.2 percent in mid-March compared with the
same time last year as the 1990 spring buying season got off to a
less-than-dazzling start, the companies said Friday.
   The automakers used incentives and temporary plant closings
earlier this year to balance production and sales levels, but
consumer demand appeared to be flagging as the March and April
buying season got under way.
   Chrysler Corp. led the slide, with its combined car and truck
sales down 26.6 percent during the period.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler said they sold
an average of 31,918 cars and trucks during March 11-20 this year,
compared with a daily rate of 36,321 during the same period last
year.
   Car sales this year were 13.2 percent lower than last year and
truck sales were down 10.5 percent. It was the third consecutive
10-day period that sales dropped compared with last year.
   Typically, car and truck sales get a shot in the arm in the
spring as Americans head for the road. But last year, after
automakers offered attractive incentives in January and February,
the hoped-for spring buying blitz fizzled.
   The companies may find themselves in a similar situation if
early indications hold.
   So far this month, Big Three car and truck sales were down 9.6
percent compared with the first 20 days of March last year.
   For the year so far, combined car and truck sales for the three
companies were down 3.9 percent, with a 0.4 percent increase in
truck sales offset by a 6.6 percent decline in car sales.
   Chrysler's mid-March car sales tumbled 29.9 percent while its
truck sales fell 23.3 percent. Through March 20 of this year,
Chrysler's combined car and truck sales were down 3.5 percent
compared with last year.
   GM said sales of its cars and trucks in mid-March were down 9.5
percent, with car sales down 10.4 percent and truck sales off 7.8
percent. So far this year, GM's cars and trucks were selling at a
pace 1.9 percent behind last year's.
   Ford's mid-March car and truck sales didn't suffer quite as much
as GM's, dropping 8.2 percent, with car sales down 10 percent and
truck sales off 5.5 percent. So far this year, Ford's combined car
and truck sales were down 6.8 percent.

<HEAD>Ampco-Pittsburgh Increases Stake in Midway Airlines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp., previously rebuffed in
its bid for a seat on the board of Midway Airlines Inc., said
Friday that it had increased its stake in the Chicago-based carrier
to 12.4 percent.
   The disclosure came in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   The filing stated that Ampco-Pittsburgh purchased an additional
280,300 Midway shares since March 8 at prices ranging from $11.50
to $11.75 per share. It now holds 1.2 million Midway common shares.
   The filing indicated that Ampco-Pittsburgh's intentions toward
Midway had not changed since January, when it said it was exploring
options after its request for representation on Midway's board was
rejected by the airline.
   Ampco-Pittsburgh did not say what those options were.
   Ampco-Pittsburgh has been given permission by the Federal Trade
Commission to acquire up to 15 percent of Midway's shares.
   In August, Ampco-Pittsburgh said in an SEC filing that it was
acquiring Midway shares for investment purposes and that it may
seek to acquire control of the airline.
   A spokesman for the Pittsburgh-based heavy manufacturing concern
said the company had no comment beyond what was contained in the
brief filing with the SEC on Friday.

   The stock market was higher this afternoon,
recovering from three straight days of declines.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 7.66 points at
2,703.38 at 3 p.m. EST. The blue-chip barometer was slipping from
its levels earlier in the day, however.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by around 4 to 3 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 844 issues up, 569 down and 532
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 110.93 million shares.
   Analysts said the market was bolstered by a moderate gain
overnight in the Tokyo stock market and an advance today in the
U.S. bond market. Wall Street has marked three consecutive sessions
of declines as the Japanese market has tumbled.
   ``We were really set for a bounce,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, a
vice president of A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis, Mo.
   In Tokyo, stock prices seesawed but managed to finish moderately
higher, ending a week of heavy losses on an up-note. The Nikkei
index of 225 selected issues, which had lost nearly 6 percent
Thursday before rebounding to end the day with a 3.1 percent loss,
gained 1.77 percent today. The index added 528.82 points to close
the week at 30,372.16.
   News today that orders for ``big-ticket'' durable goods rose 3.3
percent in February lifted bond prices, since the increase was
smaller than most economists expected.
   ``That was good news,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president
at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y. ``It suggests that we're in

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stoll Moss Theaters Ltd., the entertainment
company of Australian businessman Robert Holmes a Court, said
Friday it has acquired a 6.61 percent stake in Really Useful Group
PLC, threatening Andrew Lloyd Webber's plan to take the company
private.
   Under British law, the British composer can force remaining
shareholders to tender their shares to him only if he gains control
of more than 95 percent of the company.
   A call to Really Useful's office seeking comment Friday evening
was answered by an answering machine.
   Lloyd Webber, who serves as a director of Really Useful, is
offering 233 pence, or the equivalent of $3.73 a share, for all of
Really Useful's 33.2 million shares outstanding. The total value of
his offer is 77.4 million pounds, or $124 million. Lloyd Webber
already owns 82.5 percent of the stock.
   Lloyd Webber has said he wants to switch his attention to movies
from theatrical musicals without worrying about the company's stock
price.
   Really Useful's shares fell 6 pence, or 10 cents, to close at
234 pence, or $3.74, Friday on London's Stock Exchange.
   Analysts said Holmes a Court might be seeking to bargain with
Lloyd Webber over both Really Useful's theater assets and
copyrights on Lloyd Webber's productions.
   Really Useful seeks to exploit the copyrights it owns to Lloyd
Webber musicals such as ``Cats'' and ``Phantom of the Opera.''

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Slide On Profit-Taking, Brazil Concerns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed substantially lower
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade on profit-taking prompted in
part by ideas that Brazilian soy exports may resume soon.
   Grain futures prices fell modestly.
   Exports of Brazilian soybean meal and oil have been on hold this
week while the government implements economic reforms aimed at
halting runaway inflation in the South American nation.
   The reforms include a new currency with free-floating foreign
exchange rates and limits on bank account withdrawals. When they
were announced a week ago, many market analysts said the measures
might result in a flood of export sales of Brazilian commodities.
   Brazil is the world's second-largest soybean grower and the
largest exporter of soy products.
   William Biedermann, research director with the commodities
brokerage Allendale Inc. in Crystal Lake, Ill., said soybean
speculators sold contracts Friday to reduce their risk to a
reopening of Brazilian exports.
   ``There is some concern that if Brazil's problems are resolved,
they would be a heavy seller over the weekend,'' he said.
   The decline in grain futures reflected pre-weekend profit-taking
and slack export sales of U.S. grains.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent to 4{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in May at $3.56} a bushel; corn futures
were \ cent to 1\ cents lower with May at $2.58{ a bushel; oats
were 1\ cents to 2} cents lower with May at $1.47} a bushel;

<HEAD>Official Plans to Sell State's Interest In Colt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Treasurer Francisco Borges just
announced a deal to make the state's pension fund a major owner of
Colt Firearms, but he's already talking about selling that interest
because he doesn't like guns.
   ``What I have is an exit strategy to get me out of this thing,''
Borges said Thursday, the day he announced a deal that gives new
life to the 154-year-old gun maker after a bitter, four-year strike.
   Asked why he would want to get out of it so quickly, Borges said
simply, ``I don't like guns.''
   Under terms of the buyout, the state will put up $25 million
from pension funds and will own about 47 percent of a newly created
company called Colt's Manufacturing Co.
   In addition, strikers would be put back to work based on
seniority and would receive a total of $13 million in back pay, a
13 percent wage increase and a stock ownership plan that will allow
United Auto Workers members to own 11.5 percent of the company.
   In return, the UAW dropped a lawsuit charging Colt with unfair
labor practices.
   Borges, who described the deal as a ``carefully structured,
potentially very profitable business,'' said his distaste for the
Colt product was outweighed by his concern for the striking
employees and his conviction that the investment would be good for
the pension fund.
   But now that the company has been saved, Borges said he would
like to curtail his role in it.
   The plan is still evolving, but it calls for the creation of a
new state program sponsored by the Department of Economic
Development and financed by selling bonds.
   Borges and Stephen B. Heintz, economic development commissioner,
said the new program would help the state save manufacturing firms
that might go out of business or move out of the state.
   Although its first beneficiary may be Colt, the main purpose
would be to position the state to step in quickly should another
company get into serious trouble.
   ``All of this is still in the exploratory stages,'' Heintz said.
   A bill to create the program is before the Legislature's
Finance, Review and Bonding Committee.
   Depending on its final form, Borges said it might enable him to
sell much of the investment in Colt at a profit within a short
period of time.

<HEAD>Bondholders Cautious About Ingersoll Bond Buyback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looming, junk-bond related debt problems are
threatening Ingersoll Publications, owner of the new St. Louis Sun
newspaper and a host of other publications.
   And so far, a plan by owner Ralph Ingersoll II to buy back some
of the company's junk bonds at cut-rate prices is not receiving a
warm welcome from analysts and bondholders.
   ``The bonds are not worth 100 cents on the dollar, but they're
certainly worth more than what the company is offering,'' Stephen
Unterhalter, senior analyst with R.D. Smith Co. in New York, said
Friday.
   Ingersoll Publications Inc., whose newspaper holdings include
the St. Louis Sun, the New Haven Register and other dailies and
weeklies across the country and in Europe, offered this week to buy
back up to $158.6 million of its debt at a big discount.
   Privately held Ingersoll, which is based in Princeton, N.J., has
been struggling to pay rising costs from last fall's startup of the
Sun and from increased interest expenses.
   The offer to buy debt comes three months before the troubled
Ingersoll subsidiary, Community Newspapers, faces what analysts say
is the impossible task of ``resetting'' its $125 million worth of
bonds.
   The bonds, issued at 13 percent interest, have been selling at
40 cents on the dollar. The reset provision for them would require
Ingersoll to raise the interest rate on June 30 so that the bonds
would sell at 101 cents.
   ``There is no way to reset them,'' said James Rubin, who has
organized a group of bondholders to negotiate with Ingersoll. ``The
interest rate is so high it's unrealistic. It would seriously
impair the credit worthiness of the bonds.''
   Ingersoll has offered to buy back up to 80 percent of the $125
million worth of bonds for 55 cents on the dollar. The company also
has offered to pay 25 cents on the dollar for 51 percent of $114.9
million in bonds that won't start paying interest until next June.
   Bondholders can't evaluate the offer because they haven't been
able to get information on the company over the past several weeks,
said Rubin, who works for Sass, Lamle, Rubin &amp; Co., a New
York-based investment firm specializing in financially distressed
companies.
   ``We think it's understandable that company officials haven't
been able to talk with us. They've been tied up trying to resolve
their problems,'' Rubin said Friday. ``We don't look at it as a
problem, but as a hurdle to overcome.''
   Ingersoll Publications declined to comment on the bond buyback,
referring questions to its financial adviser Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
   The financial problems hitting Ingersoll Publications are based
partly on the sagging state of the junk-bond market, where prices
have fallen widely _ boosting interest rates _ since the highly
publicized failures of several junk-financed companies, such as
Campeau Corp.'s Federated and Allied department store chains.
   The market also has been hit hard by the collapse in February of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., its main underwriter and a key source
of financing for Ingersoll acquisitions in recent years.
   Analysts say Ingersoll also suffered because it paid too much
and took on too much debt to buy Community Newspapers in 1987,
analysts said.
   Since the much-ballyhooed launch of the brash new tabloid Sun,
which has been spending money on a slew of promotions but has
attracted limited advertising, Ingersoll has been buying and
selling newspapers.
   He bought the New Haven Register from Goodson Newspapers Inc. in
December for $255 million. That same month, he bought 50 percent
interest in three newspapers in Dublin, Ireland.
   In January, he sold 10 small dailies in Massachusetts, Ohio, New
York, Michigan, Indiana, North Carolina and Wisconsin.
   Analysts speculated that Ingersoll sold some of the newspapers
to help pay interest expenses. But company spokesman Arthur Wright
said Friday the sale was part of the company's new corporate
strategy to sell small dailies that aren't near a metropolitan area.
   Ingersoll owns 19 daily newspapers in the United States and
Great Britain and also operates a dozen chains of weekly
newspapers, most of them located in the same cities as Ingersoll
daily newspapers.

   A Greyhound Lines representative met with
federal mediators today in an effort to solve a drivers strike but
the meeting produced no plan for further bargaining sessions,
according to a source close to the negotiations.
   Greyhound's chief negotiator, Anthony P. Lannie, met with
mediators at the National Mediation and Conciliation Service to
discuss the company's position on wages and grievance procedures.
   ``The meeting did not result in plans for a new bargaining
session,'' said a source close to the mediation process. The
company broke off talks in the three-week old strike Sunday in
Tucson, Ariz.
   The company has said it would not bargain with the union until
attacks on buses stop. Since Wednesday, shots have been fired at
four Greyhound buses driven by replacement drivers and a fifth was
pelted by rocks. Nobody was seriously injured, authorities said.
   Early today, someone shot an arrow at a bus carrying 59
passengers in Cleveland. The arrow hit a window on the passenger
side. No one was injured.
   Unions representing 6,300 drivers and an estimated 3,000 other
Greyhound workers walked out over wages, job security and grievance
procedures. Greyhound operates the only nationwide intercity bus
service, and the strike has stranded many smaller communities for
which buses are the only public transportation.
   There have been 20 shootings at buses nationwide since the
strike began March 2, the company said Thursday.
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions in Washington
released its own list Thursday, saying 55 pickets have been injured
over the three weeks by being struck by buses, hit by security
guards, or in other incidents.
   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said Thursday the violence
pushes Greyhound away from reopening talks.
   ``It's impossible to reach an agreement while this violence and
terrorism is going on,'' Gravley said.
   Nelson said any suggestion that violent acts have tacit approval
from union leaders is ``absolutely ridiculous.''
   There have been no serious injuries in the 20 shootings. But on
the second day of the strike a veteran Greyhound driver was crushed
to death on the picket line by a bus driven by a replacement in
Redding, Calif. No charges were filed.
   In the most recent shootings:
   _The company said a Dallas-bound bus with no passengers aboard
was fired upon 15 miles east of Lake Charles, La., Thursday
evening. The bullet penetrated a rear air filter, the company said,
but police in Calcaiseu Parish said it appeared that a van had a
tire blowout as it passed the bus near the Iowa exit of Interstate
10.
   _Earlier Thursday in the St. Louis area, gunfire hit the
windshield of a bus carrying 19 passengers from St. Louis to
Memphis, Tenn., on Interstate 55, and four shots struck a bus
carrying eight passengers from Chicago, Greyhound spokesman George
Gravley said. There were no injuries in either shooting.
   _On Wednesday, a bullet was fired at a bus carrying 30 people in
San Antonio. The bullet struck but did not penetrate a service door.
   _A Greyhound bus en route to Los Angeles was pelted by rocks on
Interstate 15, west of the Las Vegas Strip on Wednesday, said
police. An elderly passenger was slightly hurt by flying glass.
   Federal and state authorities were investigating the shootings.
   Nelson said the union issued letters Wednesday afternoon asking
members to refrain from violence.
   ``Whoever has committed these crimes should know that the union
will support prosecution to the fullest extent of the law,'' Nelson
said. ``These are extremely unfortunate incidents.''

<HEAD>Huge Demand Forces KFC to Drop Ads on New Product</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kentucky Fried Chicken's new Hot Wings
have proven too hot to handle.
   The Pepsico Inc. subsidiary said Thursday it was suspending a
2-week-old national television advertising campaign for the spicy
chicken product because sales are running 50 percent above
projections and it needs time to rebuild its supply.
   ``It's an absolute success. Consumers love 'em,'' said KFC
spokesman Gregg Reynolds. ``We just hope people will be patient
when they run into short supply.''
   Kentucky Fried Chicken could use a lift, as the chain has proven
a drag in recent months on earnings from Pepsico's restaurant
division.
   In the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, Pepsico said its restaurant
business posted a 9 percent increase in operating profit to $114.3
million.
   But while quarterly earnings rose 21 percent at Pizza Hut and 33
percent at Taco Bell, they fell 12 percent at Kentucky Fried
Chicken.
   KFC launched Hot Wings, which are breaded and deep-fried chicken
wings, on March 5. The national advertising campaign began a week
later. KFC had either rescheduled its ads or was working on doing
so. The suspension reportedly affected TV contracts worth about $4
million.
   KFC has also ordered its company-owned restaurants to remove
promotional banners and signs while it rebuilds supplies.
   The fast-food chain is promoting Hot Wings as a snack to younger
consumers and those who are not regular customers in an effort to
increase customers. They are are sold in two sizes _ six pieces for
$1.89 and 18 pieces for $4.99.
   KFC originally projected that it would sell 6.2 million pounds
of Hot wings during the first two weeks of national promotion.
Instead, the total will be close to 9 million, officials said.
   Hot Wings are expected to make up 17 percent of total sales,
said John Inwright, director of food for KFC National Purchasing
Cooperative Inc. But he said some KFC restaurants are reporting
more than half of their sales from Hot Wings alone.

   The stock market rose today, recovering from
three straight days of declines.
   Analysts said the market was bolstered by a moderate gain

U.S. bond market. Wall Street has marked three consecutive sessions

   In Tokyo, stock prices seesawed but managed to finish moderately

index of 225 selected issues, which had lost nearly 6 percent
Thursday before rebounding to end the day with a 3.1 percent loss,
gained 1.77 percent today. The index added 528.82 points to close
the week at 30,372.16.
   The government report today that orders for ``big-ticket''
durable goods rose 3.3 percent in February lifted bond prices,
since the increase was smaller than most economists expected.
   ``That was good news,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president
at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y. ``It suggests that we're in
that no-boom, no-bust trajectory.''
   The perception that inflation is under control in the United
States was one of the factors supporting Wall Street's recent
impressive rally. It was reflected in the dollar's strength against
other major currencies such as those of Japan and West Germany,
where faster economic growth has fueled inflation fears lately.

   General Mills Inc. has begun an
experimental business delivering casual foods such as chicken
wings, roast chicken and sandwiches to customers ordering by
telephone.
   Called Bringer's, the service is provided only to people who
live in southwest Minneapolis and parts of suburban Edina,
Richfield and Bloomington.
   The Bringer's venture fits the General Mills strategy of
experimenting with concepts for several years before launching them
nationally. The company recently opened a Chinese restaurant in
Orlando, Fla., called China Coast, which industry analysts say
eventually could parallel its successful Italian chain, Olive
Garden.
   General Mills also owns the Red Lobster restaurant chain and
markets consumer food products, including Big G cereals and Betty
Crocker bakery mixes.
   The company said Bringer's is strictly an exploratory venture
and it has no plans for expansion now.
   ``But we would never be this far if we thought the only place we
could be successful was in a pocket of the Twin Cities,'' said
Craig Shulstad, a company spokesman.
   Bringer's is General Mills' second try at finding a business
strategy to serve dual-income families who don't have the time or
energy to cook at home or go to a restaurant. Its first attempt,
the Order Inn, ended in 1988 after a year's trial.
   While Bringer's is similar to the Order Inn, there are distinct
differences that demonstrate what General Mills learned through its
first effort.
   Order Inn was designed to deliver restaurant-style food to
people's homes. The menu items were more expensive, including
grilled salmon and prime rib, and they were delivered cold in
refrigerated vans for reheating at home.
   Bringer's will supply food hot and its offerings are decidedly
more plebeian, with prices to match.
   ``Everything we know says that's where the American public is
headed,'' said Gary Rodkin, president of Bringer's and a vice
president of General Mills. ``Casual dining and convenience seem to
be two trends that are very apparent and we believe we have the
right kind of menu to serve those needs.''
   By late April, customers also will be able to go to a Bringer's
take-out store in Edina to pick up food to take home.

<HEAD>Sales Slide in Mid-March As Rebates Dwindled</HEAD>

   Sales of North American-built cars and trucks
tumbled 9.5 percent in mid-March compared with a weak period last
year as the absence of big rebates, especially on trucks, showed
its effect, automakers said Friday.
   The nine major automakers with U.S. plants said they sold cars
and trucks at an average daily rate of 35,497 during March 11-20
this year, compared with a rate of 39,225 during the same period
last year.
   Car sales slipped 8.9 percent while truck sales were down 10.6
percent.
   The slide in truck sales, which make up 38 percent of all
vehicles sold in the United States, may end soon. On Thursday,
General Motors Corp., for the first time, offered $1,000 rebates on
its three-vehicle line of front-wheel-drive minivans.
   Ford Motor Co. already was offering a $500 rebate on its
Aerostar minivan.
   When Chrysler Corp. offered incentives on its market-leading
minivans in late December and January, sales soared. But since the
incentives expired, sales have plummeted.
   Chrysler led the decline in mid-March sales with a 29.9 percent
drop in car sales and a 23.3 percent decline in truck sales,
combining for a 26.6 percent overall sales skid.
   ``The minivan incentives probably created a lot of sales for
them, but pulled sales from March,'' said auto analyst Douglas
Laughlin of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. of New York. ``More definitively,
the Omni-Horizon has been discontinued, so they are not pushing
those.''
   Chrysler stopped making those subcompact cars, which accounted
for about 79,500 sales last year, in early February when the No. 3
automaker closed a plant in Detroit. The company currently has no
large-volume subcompact car.
   Mid-March sales at GM and Ford fell less drastically than at
Chrysler. GM's combined car and truck sales were 9.5 percent lower
during the period and Ford's were down 8.2 percent.
   Sales in mid-March last year were below what proved to be the
trend for the entire year, and this year the demand appears down
from that.
   The overall sales rate in mid-March, Laughlin said, ``still
reflects weakness in the industry and the fact that interest rates
are rising.''
   Usually, March and April are hot car and truck selling months as
Americans prepare for spring and summer road trips. But as
automakers move incentive offers in and out of the market, trends
tend to vanish.
   ``You look at the first two 10-day periods (of March) and it
would seem that way,'' Laughlin said.
   For the first 20 days of the month, the car and truck sales rate
was 9.6 percent behind last year's pace.
   Since the first of the year, Chrysler's combined car and truck
sales were down 3.5 percent compared with last year. The strong
January minivan sales helped soften the blow of weak car sales.
   GM said its car sales were down 10.4 percent and truck sales
were off 7.8 percent in mid-March. So far this year, vehicles made
by the world's largest automaker were selling at a pace 1.9 percent
behind last year's.
   No. 2 Ford's mid-March car sales fell 10 percent and truck sales
dropped 5.5 percent, the smallest decline of the Big Three. Ford's
combined car and truck sales were down 6.8 percent through March 20
this year compared with last.

   Here are sales results for the nine major
automakers with U.S. assembly plants for second period of March
1990.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were eight selling days in the period this year and eight
selling days last year, and 67 selling days so far this year,
compared with 66 selling days in the corresponding period a year
earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and
appear in this table. Subaru began producing cars in September at a
joint venture plant in Lafayette, Ind.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>U.S. Automakers Increasingly Compare Themselves to the Japanese</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lee Iacocca, the Chrysler Corp. chairman who's
talked frankly with Americans for years, leans forward and peers
over his bifocals.
   He's just spent 52 seconds of national television advertising
time emphatically reminding lieutenants in the Chrysler boardroom
that the company's cars are just as good as Japan's, but there's a
problem.
   ``Nobody knows it,'' says Iacocca, ``and that's going to
change.''
   His pitch to change Chrysler's image is perhaps the boldest
example of a theme that has dominated Detroit's effort to contain
the foreign assault on the U.S. car market, of which Japan commands
a 25 percent chunk. The Big Three are telling consumers to buy
American cars because they're just as good as Japan's.
   What Iacocca's message doesn't tell consumers is that many cars
with Big Three nameplates are now either produced in Japan,
designed by the competition or built in partnership with the
increasingly mighty rivals across the Pacific.
   General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet Division, for example, markets
its four small Geo vehicles as ``import inspired.'' Actually, two
of the cars are made in Japan, and the other two are assembled in
GM-Japanese joint venture plants in the United States ana corral of new
Chrysler cars serving
as a backdrop while executives talk about the company's cars and
make themselves available to the press.
   In Atlanta last week, Iacocca repeated his message saying he
wants to take the ``Teflon kimono'' off Japanese automakers.
   ``We have a perception that in the '80s we built lousy cars and
guess what? We built lousy cars,'' he said standing in front of
some of Chrysler's 1990 models.
   Ford is doing basically the same thing with the Escort, a car
that won't be a big profit-maker but one the company calls critical
in efforts to meet federal fuel efficiency regulations.
   Automakers shouldn't expect too quick of a bang out of their
Japanese comparison advertising or road shows, said auto analyst
Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. of New York. Their advertising
may not make too much of a difference anyway, he said.
   ``The crux of the matter here is that people buy cars on what
they've experienced and what they've heard other people have
experienced,'' Brady said. ``It doesn't matter if you think you're
equal today.
   ``If you've proven to be inferior in the recent past, you will
have to pay a price for that.''
   Japanese automakers themselves fought a similar battle in the
1970s.
   ``It was hard for them to gain a toehold in our market because
their products were cheap and inferior,'' Brady said.
   ``And they kept chipping away.''

   Energy futures ended higher Friday led by
strength in gasoline, after a choppy week of trading sparked by
concern about seasonal demand weakness.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the key grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 39 cents
to finish at $20.39 a 42-gallon barrel after a 4-cent rise on
Thursday.
   Contracts for later delivery also advanced.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
unleaded gasoline for delivery next month, which fell 0.56 cent in
the previous session, advanced 0.28 cent to 57.66 cents a gallon.
May unleaded gasoline jumped 1.56 cents to 63.54 cents and June
gained 0.98 cent to 62.77 cents.
   No. 2 heating oil for April delivery ended at 55.46 cents a
gallon, up 0.45 cent, while May gained 0.70 cent to 53.67 cents and
June rose 0.89 cent to 52.98 cents.
   Analysts said two consecutive weeks of lower gasoline
inventories was bullish for the gasoline market and helped buoy the
crude and heating oil markets. Tighter gasoline supplies around the
Gulf of Mexico became more noticeable late Thursday, they said.
   ``Demand for gasoline is picking up in the Gulf. Apparently
there's not as much available as people thought so gasoline led the
market up,'' said Tom Bentz, director of futures trades for United
Energy Inc.
   Analysts attributed the lower gasoline supplies partly to
seasonal refinery maintenance, when big oil companies close
refineries for annual repair. During the maintenance period,
refineries use less crude oil and make fewer fuel products, such as
gasoline.
   Oil prices have sagged in recent weeks due mainly to increasing
supplies and slowing demand. OPEC is believed to be producing about
1 million barrels a day more of crude oil than the market can
absorb.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mostly higher in domestic and
foreign trading Friday but fell sharply against the yen as
investors regained some confidence in the Japanese currency.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Analysts said a rise in interest rates in Japan and a recovery
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange after a string of steep losses helped
support the yen, which itself has fallen sharply in recent weeks.
   Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management Inc.,
said traders believed Japanese yields would go even higher, which
would make the yen even more attractive.
   The dollar fell to 154.30 yen in New York from 155.095 late
Thursday. In Tokyo early Friday, the dollar rose 0.24 yen to a
closing 155.07 yen, and in London, it was quoted at a sharply lower
rate of 153.85 yen.
   Overseas dealers said the dollar was hit in afternoon dealings
by a report, later denied, that Japan was moving to issue
dollar-denominated bonds in a bid to add a layer of intervention to
help the sagging yen.
   The dollar also was hit by profit-taking before Friday's talks
between Treasury Secretary James Brady and his Japanese
counterpart, Ryutaro Hashimoto, in Los Angeles.
   Barbanel said the dollar's strong showing against other
currencies was due partly to higher interest rates in the United
States, and also to concerns about tensions between the Soviet
Union and Lithuania. The dollar is seen as a safe haven in times of
international political strife.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's quotes, included: 1.7135 West German marks, up from
1.7028; 1.5200 Swiss francs, up from 1.5120; 5.7720 French francs,
up from 5.7415; 1,260.25 Italian lire, up from 1,255.50; and
1.17505 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17575.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.7100 West German marks, up from 1.7054; 1.5179
Swiss francs, up from 1.5150; 5.7645 French francs, up from 5.7505;
1.9249 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9210; 1,258.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,255.50; and 1.1751 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1757.
   The pound recovered somewhat from its recent slide on Britain's
economic woes and political uncertainty. In London, the pound rose
to $1.6040 from $1.6015 late Thursday, but it fell in New York to
$1.6010 from $1.6040.
   Gold fell $5.10 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New
York, closing at $388.90. Later, Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid of $389.10 a troy ounce, down $4.90.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $386.95 a troy ounce
from $393.05 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a
closing bid of $391.50 from $393 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 13 cents to close at a bid
$393.65.
   Silver fell 4.1 cents to $5.043 a troy ounce on the Commodity
Exchange. In London, silver fell to a late bid price of $5.04 a
troy ounce, down from Thursday's $5.08.

   The stock market rose modestly Friday,
recovering from three straight days of declines.
   Analysts said the market was bolstered by a moderate gain
overnight in the Tokyo stock market and an advance Friday in the
U.S. bond market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 8.56 points to
2,704.28. The blue-chip barometer slipped from its levels earlier
in the day, however.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by around 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
884 up, 571 down and 527 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 132.07 million
shares, down from 175.93 million in Thursday's session.
   ``We were really set for a bounce,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, a
vice president of A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis, Mo.
   In Tokyo, stock prices seesawed but managed to finish moderately
higher, ending a week of heavy losses on an up-note. The Nikkei
index of 225 selected issues, which had lost nearly 6 percent
Thursday before rebounding to end the day with a 3.1 percent loss,
gained 1.77 percent Friday. The index added 528.82 points to close
the week at 30,372.16.
   Wall Street declined on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, partly
in response to the Japanese slide.
   The report that U.S. orders for ``big-ticket'' durable goods
rose 3.3 percent in February lifted stock and bond prices, since
the increase was smaller than most economists expected.
   ``That was good news,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president
at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y. ``It suggests that we're in
that no-boom, no-bust trajectory.''
   The perception that inflation is under control in the United
States was one of the factors supporting Wall Street's recent
impressive rally. It was reflected in the dollar's strength against
other major currencies such as those of Japan and West Germany,
where faster economic growth has fueled inflation fears lately.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, AT&amp;T was up &lsqb; at 41{,
Philip Morris rose ~ to 39&rsqb;, General Electric gained &rsqb; at 63} and
Exxon edged up &lsqb; to 46&lsqb;.
   IBM was down 1{ at 105. A newspaper report said the computer
giant has told customers it won't deliver an upgrade to its line of

<HEAD>Bond Prices Post Tiny Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices posted small gains Friday after a
volatile session during which prices climbed on new signs of
economic weakness and fell on worries that the Japanese may start
issuing dollar-denominated securities.
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose &lsqb; point, or about $1.25
per $1,000 in face value. Its yield slipped to 8.47 percent from
8.48 percent late Thursday.
   Analysts said bond prices initially rose after the government
announced a 3.3 percent gain in durable goods orders last month.
   ``The durable goods report was weaker than expected, and showed
there is still some sluggishness in factory sector,'' said Steven
A. Wood, economist for BankAmerica Capital Markets Group in San
Francisco.
   The 30-year bond rose more than } point, or $7.50 for every
$1,000 in face value, on that news.
   But Wood said prices lost ground after a news report from Japan
indicated the Japanese government may be considering issuing
dollar-denominated securities in an effort to support the sagging
yen.
   The report raised fears that the market would be unable to
absorb the extra bond supply. ``That took prices down, but as the
market discounted those fears, prices came back again,'' Wood said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose by between 1-32 point and 3-32 point, intermediate
maturities gained &lsqb; point and long-term issues rose 1-16 point to &lsqb;
point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.76 to 1,154.80.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 1-32 point to 91 9-16. The average
yield to maturity held steady at 7.49 percent.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.12 percent as the
discount lost 4 basis points to 7.86 percent. Yields on six-month
bills slipped to 8.24 percent as the discount fell to 7.82 percent.
Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.27 percent as the discount
declined 2 basis points to 7.70 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8\ percent, unchanged from
late Thursday.

<HEAD>Old Factories, Grain Elevators Targeted For Preservation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From Buffalo's rusty waterfront to the
steel-mill hulks of Pittsburgh, a small but growing movement is
underway to save examples of industry from the ravages of the
post-industrial age by preserving them as national parks.
   The thought may startle those for whom the term ``national
park'' conjures up images of jagged mountains, foaming waterfalls,
boiling geysers and other pastoral scenes.
   ``A revolution is going on that I think is as significant as the
industrial revolution of the late 1800s,'' said Eric N. DeLony,
head of the National Park Service's Historic American Engineering
Record unit. ``We're in the process of completely redefining our
economic base.''
   In that process, old factories, canals and warehouses that no
longer have an economic role to play face the threat of a wrecker's
ball. DeLony said if he had his way, sites like the baker's dozen
of grain elevators along the Buffalo waterfront would be preserved
as parks.
   ``It's this cluster of 13 huge concrete monoliths along the lake
shore,'' he said. ``They are representative of industry in America.
We are one of the largest grain producers and have been so
historically, and elevators are a stop in the process of moving
grain from the heartland east.''
   The grain elevator was invented here in 1842, and Buffalo's
specimens include the 92-year-old Great Northern, one of only two
surviving brick-and-steel elevators, and the quarter-mile-long
Concrete Central, big enough to handle three lake freighters
simultaneously and the largest in the world when built in 1918.
   Buffalo remains the country's flour-milling capital, and half
the elevators are still in use. But Concrete Central stands vacant,
and the crumbling Great Northern has been threatened with
demolition by owner Pillsbury Inc.
   To architecture students from Canada and Europe who take boat
tours of the elevators each summer, such buildings are an important
landmark in the development of 20th century architecture, their
stark walls inspiring modernist architects such as Erich Mendelsohn
and Le Corbusier.
   ``It became known as the form-follows-function school of
architecture _ very clean, simple lines, as opposed to the
Victorian style which was very decorative,'' said Lorraine Pierro,
president of Buffalo's Industrial Heritage Committee.
   But many Buffalo residents, when they think of the elevators at
all, see them as just a hazy part of the industrial wasteland.
   ``I think it's partly a fault of the educational system,''
Pierro said. ``Many people said to me, they've lived in this area
all their lives and never knew where the Buffalo River was.''
   The preservation movement is more advanced in Lowell, Mass., 25
miles north of Boston, where twin national and state parks
incorporate much of the city's downtown.
   ``We have a representative sample of the important buildings in
Lowell's history,'' said Chrysandra Walter, superintendent of
Lowell National Historic Park.
   ``We have a mill building. We have a boardinghouse, where the
mill girls and the immigrants lived. We have an agent's house,
where the mill agent and his family would have lived. The state has
11 or so gatehouses along the canal, that house the mechanism for
running the canal.''
   The park has become Lowell's main tourist attraction, partly
because industrial New England is not the sort of place visitors
expect to find a national park, said Michelle Hatem, executive
director of the Northern Middlesex Convention and Visitors Bureau.
   ``People at first say, `What do you mean it's a park?''' she
said. ``They expect green space, nature and all.''
   Other industrial heritage parks in existence or in the works
incorporate the Lake Michigan-Illinois River canal system in
Chicago; the steel mills of Pittsburgh's Monongahela Valley; and
the coal, steel and railroads of northeastern Pennsylvania.
   Parks have also been proposed for the copper industry of
northern Michigan, Washington state's hydroelectric plants and even
the Cape Canaveral space center.
   The first step in preserving something like Buffalo's grain
elevators is for a crew of students, under the direction of DeLony
and his full-time staff of seven, to make architectural drawings.
   ``This is a very pedantic, scholarly exercise,'' DeLony said.
``I'll have two or three students up there this summer, if the
funding comes through, measuring and drawing.''
   The drawings will be a permanent record of the buildings in the
event they are destroyed, but the exercise also sends a message, he
said: ``Look, Buffalonians, if the federal government and the
National Park Service are interested enough to send a special team
to your city to document these structures, they're worth saving.''
   While the federal government is interested enough to spend
$380,000 a year on documenting historic buildings, it's usually up
to local governments and preservationists to raise the larger sums
necessary to acquire and preserve historic buildings.
   DeLony, who grew up in Cleveland and visited Buffalo frequently
as a child, said Buffalo's preoccupation with enhancing its
national image could be used in the project's favor.
   ``My image of Buffalo was Niagara Falls, first of all, but the
other image was these magnificent grain elevators,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Resume Slide on Dollar Strength</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices tumbled to 4{-month lows Friday on New
York's Commodity Exchange amid heavy European selling as the dollar
resumed its advance against most other major currencies.
   On other commodity markets, silver also retreated; grains and
soybeans fell; energy future advanced; and livestock and meat
futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $5.30 to $5.60 lower with the contract for
delivery in April at $389.40 a troy ounce, the lowest settlement
for a near-month gold contract since Nov. 10.
   Silver futures ended 4.1 cents to 4.7 cents lower in New York
with March at $5.043 a troy ounce.
   Analysts said buying interest in gold has faded as prices have
skidded from near $430 an ounce over the past six weeks. April gold
fell by $11.50 in this week alone.
   Gold is traded in dollars on the world market, so a stronger
dollar makes the metal more expensive in terms of other currencies,
discouraging foreign buying.
   But analysts said gold's decline in the face of global political
and economic uncertainty suggests other factors are also at play.
   Gold traditionally has been viewed as a safe haven for investors
during times of inflation and political crises such as the current
showdown between the Soviet Union and the breakaway Lithuanian
republic.
   But instead of buying gold, international investors have shunned
the metal, preferring to buy U.S. dollars.
   ``The dollar is becoming the safe haven,'' said John Jonat, a
precious-metals trader with Deak International Inc.
   William O'Neill, research director with Elders Futures Inc.,
said the gold market ignored a bevy of traditionally bullish
developments during the week, including rising U.S. retail prices,
predictions for high inflation in Britain, a sharp drop Thursday in
the stock market and the increasingly tense Lithuanian situation.
   At the same time, the dollar has surged in value.
   ``You can see that the focus here is on the dollar more than
anything else,'' O'Neill said.
   Soybean futures prices fell substantially on the Chicago Board
of Trade on profit-taking prompted in part by beliefs that
Brazilian soy exports may resume soon. Grain futures prices fell
modestly.
   Exports of Brazilian soybean meal and oil have been on hold this
week while the government implements economic reforms aimed at
halting runaway inflation in the South American nation.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 4{ cents lower with May at
$3.56} a bushel; corn futures were \ cent to 1{ cents lower with
May at $2.58{ a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2 cents lower with
May at $1.47} a bushel; and soybeans were 5 cents to 7 cents lower
with May at $5.98 a bushel.
   Petroleum futures advanced in technically inspired trading on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 39 cents
higher with May at $20.39 a barrel; heating oil was .45 cent to .70
cent higher with April at 55.46 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .15 cent to 1.56 cents higher with April at 57.66 cents a
gallon.
   Expectations for stronger cash markets next week prompted buying
of livestock futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Pork
bellies ended mixed ahead of the Agriculture Department's monthly
cold-storage report, which showed a lower-than-expected amount of
pork bellies in commercial freezers as of Feb. 28.
   Belly prices are expected to rise in reaction to the report when
trading resumes Monday.
   Live cattle futures settled .20 cent lower to .38 cent higher
with April at 77.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent
lower to .22 cent higher with March at 82.65 cents a pound; live
hogs were .05 cent to .73 cent higher with April at 53.75 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .58 cent lower to .50 cent higher
with March at 50.87 cents a pound.

<HEAD>UAL Opens Door To Davis Stock Purchase; Analysts Play Down
Development</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp.'s board of directors said Friday it
will let former suitor Marvin Davis again buy company stock,
raising the possibility of a rival buyout offer to the $3.8 billion
bid by UAL's unions and a major shareholder.
   Davis sparked a bidding war for UAL last August but later
withdrew his buyout proposals after the company, the parent of
United Airlines, accepted a higher offer from a group led by senior
management and its pilots union. That plan later collapsed.
   UAL stock finished up $5.12{ at $157.87{ Friday on the New York
Stock Exchange, although Coniston Partners, UAL's biggest
shareholder and the backer of the union buyout, expressed
skepticism that Davis would make an offer.
   ``I'm not sure what they (board members) were trying to
accomplish or what the implications might be,'' said Keith Gollust,
a principal in Coniston, a New York-based investment group.
   Gollust said that more than two months ago, Coniston urged the
UAL board to lift the restriction on Davis' purchase of stock as a
way to enhance shareholder value.
   ``I don't see why anyone shouldn't be able to buy the stock,''
he said in a telephone interview Friday. ``As a practical matter, I
don't expect him (Davis) to make a bid. ...It's very speculative.''
   Rob Doughty, UAL spokesman, said he could not elaborate on a
brief statement that the company had modified a standstill
agreement with Davis to allow him to buy stock. Davis spokeswoman
Mary Conway in New York also had no comment. Neither would say if
Davis has a new buyout offer on the table.
   In January, the UAL board said it would consider offers from
Davis, but the agreement had blocked him from purchasing stock.
   Davis, a Los Angeles billionaire, last August made an
unsolicited offer, which was not accepted, of $200 a share or $4.32
billion for UAL.
   The United Airines pilots were the first employee group to
propose buying the company, three years ago.
   The fourth and latest proposal was announced Monday by Coniston
and the unions representing United's pilots, machinists and flight
attendants. Representatives of those unions were not immediately
available for comment on Friday.
   Under the offer, shareholders would receive $150 per share in
cash, $25 in debt securities and stock in the new company, and the
unions would make wage and benefit concessions in five-year
contracts that contain no-strike clauses.
   The bid would give UAL employees, including non-union workers,
75 percent ownership of the company.
   The UAL board on Thursday said it would negotiate on the latest
offer by the Coniston-union group, even though it believed the
offer had ``serious deficiencies,'' including its value and the
group's ability to finance it.
   The board also said it had directed its financial advisers to
develop a plan for selling company assets. It said advisers also
should consider buyout proposals from other parties and discuss
other alternatives for increasing the value of UAL shares.
   In proposing the buyout, Coniston also threatened a proxy fight
to replace the UAL board of directors at the company's April 26
meeting. The group owns 11.8 percent of UAL's outstanding stock.
   Robert J. Joedicke, advising director of Shearson Lehman Hutton
in New York, said he did not think lifting the standstill
restriction on Davis changed the buyout situation significantly.
   Joedicke said a takeover of UAL would be so complicated that
Davis likely would have to join forces with other parties. But he
added, ``If he got involved, all indications are he'd want to be
more than one of the players.''

<HEAD>Producers Agree to Extension of Pact with Consumers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's key cocoa-producing countries agreed
Friday to back a two-year extension of the present International
Cocoa Agreement, with all price-support provisions frozen for the
duration, a producer spokesman said.
   The producers accepted in all details the plan for the extension
put forward by Peter Baron, the West German chairman of the
41-nation International Cocoa Organization, said producer spokesman
Kouame N'Guessan of the Ivory Coast.
   But he said that his side at a separate meeting Friday did not
reach a view on how the money needed to implement the extension
could be guaranteed, and needed more time to study the question.
   Money is required to finance the storage of the cocoa
organization's stockpile of 250,000 metric tons, which under
Baron's plan would be frozen during the extension period.
   Delegates said that financing would be the key issue when the
two sides begin a further week of discussions on the cocoa pact on
Monday.
   The European Community and the cocoa organization's other
leading consumers earlier this week accepted in principle Baron's
plans, but officials said they wanted the extension linked to
guarantees of adequate funding.
   The plan calls for the cocoa pact to be extended for two years
starting Oct. 1, with all its present dormant powers to support
prices officially suspended.
 ctober, but
cash-in-hand Sept. 15 is forecast at $15 million.
   The shortfall is the result of unpaid producer debts to the
organization totalling $140 million.
   Consumers have informally proposed that producers should either
pay some of their debts, or agree that in an emergency some of the
stockpiled cocoa could be sold to raise cash.
   They have suggested a token debt repayment of $15 million, or
permission for the cocoa organization to sell 20,000 tons if
necessary.

<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines Inc. said Friday it lost
$298.5 million in 1989, contrasting with a profit of $249.7 million
the previous year.
   The company, which was taken private by investor Carl Icahn in
October 1988, said it had an operating profit of $24.3 million for
the year ended Dec. 31, down sharply from $259.3 million in 1988.
   It said its operating revenue rose 3.4 percent to $4.51 billion
in 1989 from $435 billion a year earlier. But operating expenses
rose at a 9.3 percent rate to $4.48 billion from $4.11 billion in
1988.
   Icahn, who is TWA's chairman, in recent months has been pushing
for wage concessions. He has asked pilots, for instance, for $80
million in wage and benefit concessions but talks have not produced
any agreement.
   The company, based in Mt. Kisco, said the full-year loss
reflected the sharp decline in operating profit and the absence in
1989 of $190.5 million in onetime gains related to its sale of
stock in another company and a cash judgment in a longstanding
legal dispute.
   TWA said its net interest expense in 1989 was up $193.9 million
from the previous year.
   The company said its operating expenses rose mainly to a
snapback of wage concessions from the machinists' union, higher
salaries for other employees, a 12 percent increase in the average
price of jet fuel and increased costs attributed to service
improvements.

   Unocal Corp. said Friday it had agreed to
sell a Norwegian oil and gas subsidiary for $322 million, the
latest in a series of asset sales by the parent of Union Oil Co. of
California.
   Total Marine Norsk AS, a subsidiary of a French company, is the
buyer of Unocal Norge AS. Its petroleum exploration and production
operations are in the Norwegian sectors of the North Sea.
   Unocal Norge is owned by a Unocal subsidiary, Unocal
International Corp. Legal paperwork must still be completed and
government approval obtained in Norway, but Unocal said the deal
was expected to close this May.
   Unocal spokesman Michael Thacher described the sale as part of a
company-wide redeployment of Unocal's $10 billion in assets, not a
retreat from the North Sea. He noted that last year, Unocal was
awarded seven offshore exploration blocks in the United Kingdom
segment of the North Sea.
   Unocal is still suffering the effects of a heavy debt burden
acquired while fending off a hostile takeover attempt in 1985 by
corporate raider T. Boone Pickens, which forced it into a major
restructuring.
   Last year, Unocal got out of the coal business, selling its Obed
Mountain coal mine at a loss that contributed to a 46 percent
decline in yearly profits.

<HEAD>RF&amp;P's Independent Directors: Let Shareholders Vote on CSX Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RF&amp;P Corp.'s independent directors reversed
themselves Friday and voted to terminate a $385 million merger deal
the railroad reached Feb. 19 with CSX Corp.
   Earlier in the day, the committee of independent directors said
termination of the $34.50-a-share deal would not be in the best
interests of RF&amp;P shareholders.
   The panel's final action followed the enlargement of the
committee to include RF&amp;P's two new directors, Jacqueline G. Epps
and Mark T. Finn. The two were recently appointed by the trustees
of the Virginia Supplementary Retirement System, which owns RF&amp;P
common stock.
   ``Following discussion with the new members of the committee,
the other members of the committee concluded that shareholder
approval of the CXS proposal was highly unlikely, and for that
reason, further pursuit of that proposal would not be in the best
interests of the RF&amp;P and its shareholders,'' the companies said in
a joint release.
   The reconstituted special committee voted unanimously to accept
the CSX proposal that the agreement be terminated. All six
CSX-affiliated directors abstained from voting on the matter, and
the action was later ratified by the full board, including the six
CSX-affiliated directors.
   Friday's decision came three days after CSX announced it wanted
to pull out of the deal because of controversy surrounding the
merger. Under the terms of the proposal, both companies' boards
must agree to terminate the merger.
   After CSX made its offer in February, numerous stock analysts
criticized it as too low considering the potential value of RF&amp;P's
real estate holdings.
   The deal also was questioned by Gov. L. Douglas Wilder. The
state owns 20 percent of RF&amp;P common stock through its Supplemental
Retirement System.
   Some observers said the CSX bid was tainted by conflicts of
interest among RF&amp;P directors. Wilder fired retirement board
chairman Charles B. Walker, who represented the retirement system
on the RF&amp;P board and supported the merger.
   CSX argued that the special committee that weighed the proposal
was composed only of RF&amp;P directors who were not associated with
CSX and that its offer was a good deal for RF&amp;P, whose shareholders
could take the $34.50 a share or exchange them for CSX shares on a
1-for-1 basis.
   Richmond-based CSX operates 19,000 miles of track in 20 states,
the District of Columbia and Ontario, Canada. RF&amp;P has 113 miles of
track between Richmond and the northern Virginia suburbs of
Washington, D.C. Both companies also have extensive commercial real
estate interests.

<HEAD>Lockheed Chairman Blasts Back at Simmons Over Proposed Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. fired back at its chief
assailant Friday, saying now is a bad time to sell assets from the
military contractor's technology services and electronics systems
groups.
   Texas investor Harold C. Simmons' proposals to do so are
``simplistic'' and show how poorly Simmons understands Lockheed,
the aerospace giant's chairman, Daniel M. Tellep, said in a
statement.
   Simmons is trying to unseat Lockheed's board of directors at the
company's annual meeting March 29. He has purchased about 19
percent of Lockheed's stock at a cost of $530 million, and has
shown a paper loss of about $100 million on his investment as the
stock price has fallen.
   He said Thursday that if he wins control of Lockheed, he likely
would sell $1 billion worth of assets in its technology and
electronics services businesses _ sales he said would help boost
the stock price. Simmons said Lockheed should concentrate on the
core business it knows: missiles, space and aeronautics.
   Though no final decision would be made until after a review of
the books, Simmons said Tellep's public statements lead him to
believe that only small portions of the non-core divisions are
profitable enough to merit keeping.
   Tellep said Simmons is ``fundamentally uninformed'' about the
technology services and electronics systems groups, adding that
there's no way to get a good price for them at present even if
selling them were a good idea.
   ``These simplistic Simmons proposals are, we believe, typical of
his attempt to sound constructive when he and his team in fact
understand very little about our businesses,'' Tellep concluded.
   On another front in their battle, Simmons' chief lieutenant, J.
Landis Martin, renewed his complaint Friday that Lockheed had
denied Simmons access to Lockheed employees. The workers own 19
percent of Lockheed through a stock-ownership plan, and Simmons
hopes they will back his slate of directors at the annual meeting.
   Martin said Lockheed promised to allow a Simmons videotape to be
shown to employees, then reneged because it lasted 24 minutes,
twice as long as a video presenting Tellep's side. Martin said he
would book time at a Los Angeles television station to show the
video, calling that ``a woefully inadequate substitute for equal
access to employees at the workplace.''
   Lockheed spokesman Bob Slayman said the Calabasas-based company
felt it had ``bent over backward'' to accommodate Simmons ``and
offered them an equal amount of time as our videotape.''
   Simmons said Thursday that Lockheed's management is unable to
face the fact that its deployment of more than $2 billion in assets
in the technology and electronics services divisions has largely
failed.
   Tellep said Friday that the interdependence of Lockheed's units
was far greater than Simmons claims.
   ``Our Electronic Services Group provides critical technologies
that are an integral component of our missiles, space and
aeronautical businesses,'' he said.

   UAL Corp.'s board of directors said it will let
former suitor Marvin Davis again buy company stock, raising the
possibility of a rival buyout offer to the $3.8 billion bid by
UAL's unions and a major shareholder.
   Davis sparked a bidding war for UAL last August but later
withdrew his buyout proposals after the company, the parent of
United Airlines, accepted a higher offer from a group led by senior
management and its pilots union. That plan later collapsed.
   UAL stock finished up $5.12{ at $157.87{ Friday on the New York
Stock Exchange, although Coniston Partners, UAL's biggest
shareholder and the backer of the union buyout, expressed
skepticism that Davis would make an offer.

   The pork people say their products are just as
nutritious as chicken, turkey and fish, but a private group says
that's hogwash and is asking the government to do something about
it.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest said an
advertising campaign by the National Pork Producers Council _ which
touts pork as ``the other white meat'' _ is ``deceptive and
dangerously misleading.''
   His group filed a petition Friday asking the Federal Trade
Commission to stop the pork council's claims and require
advertising corrections.
   ``We're confident that our advertising is accurate and can be
backed up by substantial scientific evidence,'' said Barry Pfouts,
director of marketing for the pork council.

<HEAD>Judge Tosses Out Much of $150 Million Xerox Lawsuit Against Apple</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bulk of a $150 million lawsuit accusing
Apple Computer Inc. of pirating pioneering Xerox Corp. designs to
create the revolutionary Macintosh computer was thrown out Friday
by a federal judge.
   Xerox immediately announced it would appeal.
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker dismissed five of six counts.
The only count remaining asks for a declaratory judgment stating
that Xerox is the owner of copyrights pertaining to its Star
computer.
   Xerox said in a statement from its Stamford, Conn.,
headquarters: ``This ruling does not mean Apple has not taken
substantial portions of Star and claimed them as their own. The
court merely held, we believe erroneously, that Xerox did not have
standing to present facts in support of that contention. ... We
intend to appeal.''
   ``We welcome the ruling in every way,'' said Apple spokeswoman
Carleen LeVasseur. ``We're pleased that the Xerox case was
dismissed today. I'm confident that the sole remaining issue will
be dismissed in the near future.''
   Referring to the remaining accusation, Lavasseur said, ``Apple
has never disputed the validity of Xerox's (copyright)
registration.''
   The suit, filed in December, alleged that Apple derived the
software for its Lisa and Macintosh computers from Xerox computer
programs.
   The suit said Steven Jobs, co-founder of Apple, had seen a
demonstration of a Xerox program called Smalltalk at Xerox's Palo
Alto Research Center in 1979, and that he and other Apple employees
were impressed with the concept and copied it.
   Smalltalk was the first computer language to use a mouse, a
small, hand-held devise used to manipulate information on a
computer screen.
   Jobs left Apple in 1985.
   The suit also claimed Apple employees saw the Xerox Star program
at a trade show in Houston in June 1981, and copied substantial
portions of it into its Lisa and Macintosh, including the design
and appearance of such on-screen devices as applications windows,
dialogue boxes and menu, and some exact symbols from the program.
   The suit asaid Xerox never licensed Apple to use the Star
computer program or its graphics, and alleged that Apple gained
unauthorized access by hiring several Xerox employees in the late
1970s and early 1980s, including Star software developers.
   Apple was granted a license in June 1981 to participate with
Xerox in a project to implement Smalltalk into a hardware system to
be developed by Apple, the suit said.
   Apple responded at the time of the suit that Xerox's software
concepts were not protected by copyright any more than images of
birds or trees were protected by the copyright on a painting.
   Software industry officials hoped the lawsuit would clarify
issues surrounding the right to copyright certain aspects of
computer programs, such as their ``look and feel.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules Owens-Corning Workers Can Sue Wickes Corp. in Failed
Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Friday cleared the way for a
union representing Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. employees to sue
Wickes Corp. for damages stemming from a failed 1986 takeover
attempt of Owens-Corning by the retailing conglomerate.
   A spokeswoman for Santa Monica, Calif-based Wickes said it would
appeal the decision by Superior Court Judge Raymond F. Drozdowski.
The judge denied Wickes' request to dismiss the case.
   The Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics &amp; Allied Workers
International Union, based in Media, Pa., filed suit against
Wickes, contending the company ``interfered with economic
expectations'' between union members and Owens-Corning.
   Wickes, best known for its home improvement centers and
furniture business, abandoned a 2{-week-old takeover attempt for
Owens-Corning in August 1986 after its $2.1 billion tender offer
apparently was beaten out by a more lucrative restructuring plan
proposed by the Toledo, Ohio-based company.
   In October 1986, Owens-Corning announced it would lay off 5,000
workers nationwide, including 500 at its Barrington, N.J. facility,
to thwart the hostile takeover.
   Wickes made a $30 million profit after expenses in its
unsuccessful takeover bid.
   ``The union will persist in our efforts to win just compensation
for our members harmed by the Wickes takeover attempt,'' James E.
Hatfield, the union's international president, said in a statement.
   Union officials could not be reached Friday for additonal
comment.
   Owens-Corning is the world's largest manufacturer of glass fiber
materials and is a major producer of polyester resins and
high-performance composite materials used in construction, autos
and boats.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on Friday
praised Japanese concessions that will lead to the sale of U.S.
supercomputers in Japan, saying, ``We're showing that we can make
some progress.''
   Brady emerged from talks with Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto to say he hoped the agreement would mollify a
protectionist-minded Congress and head off possible trade sanctions
against Japan.
   Topics at the wide-ranging talks included reunification of East
and West Germany and the April 6 and 7 special meeting in Paris of
the seven Western industrialized nations, Brady said.
   He said he briefed Hashimoto on his conversations with other
leaders in preparation for that meeting, including details of a
French proposal for a European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development that will lend money to Eastern Europe.
   American trade negotiators said Friday in Washington that Japan
had agreed to remove various restrictions preventing U.S. companies
from selling supercomputers to Japanese universities and government
agencies.
   Those concessions came during talks on specific industries being
conducted under a section of the 1988 trade law known as Super 301.
Brady said he had no progress to report on the other Super 301
industries, lumber and satellites.
   ``Are they (supercomputer concessions) all we want?'' Brady
asked. ``No. Are we going to get more? Yes. When, I can't say. I
hope soon.''
   At an evening news conference following Friday's session, Brady
said ``It really was just a meeting to talk.''
   A joint statement issued said Brady and Hashimoto discussed ``a
range of bilateral and multilateral issues.''
   Those included the Structural Impediments Initiative _ proposed
changes to eliminate broad trade impediments in both countries _
and the proposed international bank to lend to Eastern Europe. It
would be led by Western European nations and would include the
Soviet Union.
   They also said they discussed global financial markets and
remained committed to ``cooperation in the exchange markets'' _ a
reference to attempts to keep the Japanese yen from continuing its
slide against the dollar.
   Asked about a report Friday from Japan that the Japanese
government might be considering issuing dollar-denominated bonds to
support the sagging yen, Brady replied, ``The matter never came
up.''
   Analysts said that report held back bond prices on Wall Street
Friday.
   Brady declined to say what Hashimoto said about the Tokyo stock
market, which has plummeted in recent months. He noted that other
international markets, including the U.S. stock market, had not
fallen and said that stability elsewhere was a good sign.
   ``Even though there has been roughly a 20 percent decline in the
Tokyo markets, the rest of the world has operated pretty much in a
stable way.'' Brady said.
   The recent plunge of the yen against the dollar has continued
even after the Bank of Japan raised the discount rate this week by
1 percent to 5.25 percent.
   In the currency market, the dollar closed the week at 155.07
yen, up 0.24 yen from Thursday's close of 154.83 yen.
   ``The demand for the dollar basically remains strong,'' said
Toshio Takahashi, a dealer with the Industrial Bank of Japan. ``The
American economy is good, despite cautiousness over inflation''
among U.S. monetary authorities, he said.
   The meetings between Hashimoto and Brady took place against a
backdrop of chaotic action on the Japanese stock market, where the
closely followed Nikkei average of 225 stocks has fallen more than
25 percent since the beginning of the year.
   Prices seesawed again Friday but finished with a moderate gain
after a week of heavy losses.
   ``The market is slowly but gradually recovering, helped by
relative stability in the currency and bond markets,'' said Akira
Shimoda, an equity analyst with Yamaichi Securities.
