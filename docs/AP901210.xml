<HEAD>French Speakers From U.S. Seek To Promote Language Back Home</HEAD>

   Paris is the venue for many strategy sessions
dedicated to the defense and promotion of the French language, but
this one had a distinctively American accent.
   There was Virgil Benoit of Red Lake Falls, Minn., who noted that
the motto on his state flag was ``L'Etoile du Nord'' - the Northern
Star.
   There was Randolph Lineham, a lawyer from Long Beach, Calif.,
whose ancestors emigrated in 1870 when Prussia annexed the Alsace
region. And there was Floyd Satterlee of Indianapolis with no
French connection other than a love of the language and culture.
   They were among 45 delegates from 20 states, representing the
estimated 1.5 million French-speaking U.S. citizens, who gathered
in Paris last week to assess the prospects for the language of
Voltaire in the land of french toast and french fries.
   The best-known French-speakers in the United States are likely
Louisiana's nearly 600,000 Cajuns. But there are French-speaking
communities from Maine to the Pacific, conference delegates said.
   Lineham said speaking French has been considered chic in certain
California circles for a long time. The Francophone community there
continues to grow with the arrival of immigrants from the former
French colonies of Cambodia and Vietnam.
   More than half the delegates in Paris were professors.
   Normand Beaupre, a university teacher and writer from Biddeford,
Maine, still remembers when Franco-Americans were called ``the
Chinese of the East'' because many of them worked in New England
textile mills.
   ``We were told, `Speak American,''' he said.
   Beaupre, 55, says it's no longer a liability to be a
French-speaking American.
   ``I have my own identity.'' he said. ``I am not a Quebecer, nor
a Frenchman, nor a Cajun. I am a Franco-American.''
   The 1980 census registered 13 million Americans of French
origin. The first French arrived at the end of the 16th century,
and France lost its last territory in the present-day U.S. with the
Louisiana Purchase in 1803.
   The three-day meeting was organized by a French association
formed 13 years ago to strengthen ties with French-speaking
Americans. The French Foreign Ministry and Paris mayor's office
provided part of the funding.
   At the close of the conference, delegates voted to seek improved
teaching of French at U.S. schools, promote French-oriented local
festivals and push for a greater availability of TV programs and
written material in French.
   ``After the second generation, the French language is very often
lost by the children,'' Beaupre said. ``We need a new strategy, and
this is to link with the international Francophone movement rather
than staying alone in each state.''

but now it looks like a No. 9 is in store.
   Already the parents of eight, the 47-year-old Walesa and his

   According to Monday's Sztandar Mlodych newspaper, Solidarity
headquarters was abuzz Sunday night with more than word of Walesa's
landslide victory.
   The newspaper said that during the victory celebration,
``headquarters staff couldn't resist talking about children ... the
`First Lady,' although it is not visible yet, is in the third month
of her pregnancy.''
   The report could not be confirmed independently. Aides in Gdansk
declined to speak about it.
   The youngest of the Walesa children, Brygida, was born in 1985.
The eldest, Bogdan, is 20 and was married in September.

   Diane Evans' parents had four sons and two
daughters. It was Diane who went to war.
   ``No place in Vietnam was safe,'' the former Army nurse recalls.
``We were in a combat zone and we were subject to attack.''
   It saddens her that two decades later, America still is coming
to grips with the prospect that women may die in war alongside men.
   If there is a war in the Persian Gulf, for the first time in
history American women may be injured or killed in significant
numbers.
   The Pentagon won't say how many women serve among the 240,000
U.S. troops in the gulf, only that they comprise somewhat less of
the gulf contingent than their 11 percent share of the overall U.S.
military.
   Images of women soldiers feature prominently in news reports
from Saudi Arabia. And the role played by women has expanded,
allowing them to serve in a whole range of support positions that
were off limits in days past. Many argue that makes them more
vulnerable if fighting breaks out.
   ``Although women don't fill combat positions, the roles that
they are serving in will expose them to hostile fire,'' said
Meredith Neizer, head of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in
the Service.
   No one is sure how the nation would respond to female
casualties.
   ``After all we've said about how far women have come, Americans
are not ready to have their women go out there and get maimed and
killed in combat,'' said Bill Taylor of the Center for Strategic
and International Studies.
   Taylor said the number of women killed or injured in a gulf war
probably would be low because women don't serve in tank and armored
infantry units.
   But even the possibility of casualties among women is generating
debate about the expanding role of women in the military and the
accompanying risks.
   ``There's been a wakeup call on what wartime military duty might
entail,'' said Martin Binkin, a military analyst with the Brookings
Institution. There's less discussion about scrapping the military's
ban on women in combat jobs, he said.
   Women are barred by law from serving on combat sips and planes
in the Navy, Air Force and Marines. The Army bars them from serving
in combat-related fields such as infantry, tank and some artillery
units. But women serve in many of the support and supply units that
could be caught in battle.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., is pushing legislation to
require a four-year test to see how women would perform in
combat-related jobs. She argues that excluding women from combat
jobs doesn't insulate them from danger but it does deny them career
advancement opportunities.
   Women, she says, often handle the communications for maneuvers,
and communications centers are considered prime targets for attack.
   ``Women would be the first hit in a strike,'' Schroeder said.
   She rejects arguments that Americans aren't ready to see women
wounded or killed. Female police officers face life-threatening
dangers daily, she notes. And a few women ``came home in body
bags'' from both World War II and Vietnam, she said.
   Eight women nurses and more than 58,000 men died in Vietnam.
More than 200 women and more than 400,000 men died in World War II.
   Retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Wilma Vaught, president of the
Women in the Military Service of America Foundation, believes the
public has overcome any special qualms about the wartime loss of
women vs. men.
   ``We've progressed far from where we were,'' she said. ``People
don't want their women killed any more than they want their men
killed. They'd like for them all to live.''
   And yet, Binkin cautions, ``you still have many people with
traditional views that war is not a place for women.''
   The question of women in combat is ``a very emotional issue and
it could very well be reopened'' by the gulf operation, he said.
   Some critics believe the public has been conditioned to accept
the expanding role of women in the military and the risk they could
die in war.
   ``We've become numbed to a point,'' said Brian Mitchell, author
of ``The Weak Link,'' a book critical of the ``feminization'' of
the military.
   ``We've had enough propaganda about how great this is that women
can go over there and fight and die like men,'' he said. ``The
American public has been conditioned ... to think that this is just
the way things are nowadays.''
   A New York Times-CBS News poll taken in January 1990, after
military women served ably in the U.S. invasion of Panama, found
that seven of 10 Americans thought women should be allowed to serve
in combat units if they wished.
   Opinion could quickly shift if hostilities result in images of
women returning to U.S. soil in caskets, Binkin said.
   ``If we get into a combat situation that brings home the point
of what war is all about, you might get different answers,'' he
said.
   For Diane Evans, the Army nurse who served in Vietnam, the key
to accepting the risks that women face in today's military lies in
acknowledging their contributions in past conflicts. She directs
the Vietnam Women's Memorial Project.
   ``We could have casualties in the gulf even before we have a
memorial built to women who died in the last war,'' Ms. Evans said.
``We want the women who go off to the next one to know they will
not be forgotten.''

<HEAD>Justice or Quotas? Political Parties Wrestle With a Hot Issue</HEAD>

   The next presidential campaign will likely
feature a fiery debate over affirmative action. But one party will
call it simple justice, the other will label it unfair quotas and
voters will have to decide whom to believe.
   Sen. Jesse Helms rode to re-election in North Carolina after
accusing his black challenger, Democrat Harvey Gantt, of supporting
racial quotas. And while some denounced the tactic, others detected
a way to bolster the identity and electoral strength of the
Republican Party.
   ``Helms came from 13 points behind to win comfortably, I think
solely on this issue,'' said GOP consultant Roger Stone. ``It is
the kind of cutting social issue that conservatives need to hold
onto the White House.''
   A number of recent developments suggest voters may be hearing a
lot more about affirmative action and racial quotas between now and
November 1992:
   -Democratic congressional leaders have renewed their pledge to
once again pass a civil rights bill that President Bush branded a
quota bill and vetoed in the last Congress.
   -Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder, the only Democrat blatantly testing
the 1992 presidential waters, blasted Bush's characterization of
the bill and said it gave Helms phony ammunition. ``I know what
racial quotas are; I have experienced them firsthand,'' Wilder, who
is black, said in a letter to Bush.
   -William Bennett, the new Republican Party chairman, defended
Helms' use of the quota issue and said he was ready to debate
affirmative action if the Democrats bring it up. ``Most Americans
are troubled'' by racial preference programs, he said.
   -Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, chided
Bennett for his remarks in a speech last week and charged that
``ideologues on the right are following a new trail of racial
resentment and recrimination'' blazed by Louisiana state legislator
David Duke.
   -Disaffected Democrats at a conservative forum predicted doom
for their party unless more moderate voices are heard. ``Until we
give up fear and discuss these issues rationally and logically, we
are going to continue to lose,'' said former New York Mayor Ed
Koch.
   Prominent Democrats say their party has a sound position but
others have distorted it.
   ``I don't know what there is to redefine,'' said party chairman
Ron Brown, who is black. ``The Democratic Party and its chairman in
particular vehemently oppose quotas. We vehemently oppose anything
that could lead to reverse discrimination. The legislation that the
Democratic Congress sent forward to the president was not a quota
bill. It was supported by a number of conservative Republicans.''
   But the Democrats - including Gantt himself - acknowledge that
they haven't communicated well with voters, many of whom equate
affirmative action with quotas. As Stone noted, ``Harvey Gantt ran
up and down North Carolina saying he wasn't for quotas, but nobody
believed him.''
   Working against the Democrats is a feeling among some voters
that the civil rights agenda of the 1960s has been fulfilled - that
affirmative action was supposed to be temporary and small-scale and
has outlived its time.
   But Gantt said hundreds of years of discrimination cannot be
remedied in two decades. ``That's not even one generation,'' he
said. ``We need to do it, and we need to remove the stigma that
we're going to discriminate against whites or we're going to
promote blacks who aren't qualified. None of that is true.''
   Many Democrats maintain the heart of the matter is economics.
They say Republicans want to divert attention from the recession,
and the whole idea of affirmative action is more threatening now
because jobs are scarce.
   ``This issue is about a shrinking economic pie and people
thinking someone's going to give their slice to somebody else,''
said Democratic strategist Mike McCurry.
   ``You have to recast the debate to show the Republicans are
trying to peddle fear instead of a plan to get the economy going.
And you have to have an answer for the working person who fears for
his job,'' he added. ``You have to say, `my plan is to develop a
red-hot economy so we all have jobs.'''
   Republican analyst Doug Bailey thinks his party, too, should
look at the big picture. He said it would be ``a big political
mistake'' to lean heavily on affirmative action to fill the void
left by the end of the Cold War and the splintering of the GOP on
abortion and taxes.
   ``It turns off a large corps of moderate voters, Northern
suburban voters who have supported the Republican party in the
past,'' Bailey said. ``They will not want to see a party
intentionally choose an issue, even though it may have some merit,
which divides people on racial lines.''
   However, Stone said the theme would appeal to a group that is
equally if not more important to the party - blue-collar ``Reagan
Democrats.'' And he maintained it could be pursued without the GOP
appearing to be insensitive or divisive.
   ``You can use other issues to illustrate your desire for
economic growth in the minority community,'' Stone said. ``Go out
and campaign against quotas but for enterprise zones and greater
financial assistance for minority education.''
   But the Democrats firmly believe they hold the higher ground on
civil rights and can persuade voters of that. Foreshadowing the
rhetoric to come, Wilder has accused Bush of failing to provide
moral leadership and Brown called his veto of the civil rights bill
a disgrace.
   ``He had an important choice to make,'' the party chairman said,
``and he chose the politics of Jesse Helms and David Duke rather
than the politics of Martin Luther King and Abraham Lincoln.''

<HEAD>Huge Trust Agency Selling Off Much of East Germany</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's largest corporation has inherited most
of what once was East Germany, with instructions to sell it off or
close it down.
   Detlev Rohwedder, the chairman, is running the sale of the
century - converting the state companies of former East Germany to
private enterprise - and says he wants to do it with consideration
for the people who might be hurt.
   He is from West Germany, but a native of Thuringia, one of
Germany's five new eastern states.
   ``I think it's great to be asked by my government to be part of
the effort,'' Rohwedder said after agreeing in early November to
take a full four-year term as chairman of Treuhand.
   The incorporated agency, whose name means Trust, was established
by the East German government last spring when it still was trying
to preserve state enterprises. Westerners moved into the management
later and Rohwedder became chairman in August.
   Treuhand's mandate is to sell as much as possible to private
owners and deliver the proceeds to the national treasury. It is
empowered to close inefficient operations or divide large ones and
sell or close the parts separately.
   It has ordered all the former East German enterprises to submit
balance sheets for analysis.
   Rohwedder, a 58-year-old lawyer, had long experience in the West
German government and was credited with the rescue from
near-bankruptcy of the Hoesch steel company.
   His trust corporation is responsible for 4.5 million to 6
million employees and owns 60 percent of eastern Germany's forests,
35 percent of the arable land, factories, housing and other real
estate.
   It will take until next spring to count the employees and
estimate what the assets are worth, Rohwedder said. By
mid-November, the trust said, it had taken in 1.5 billion marks ($1
billion) from the sale of state companies.
   Although the East German economy was considered in bad shape,
its output in 1989 was estimated at the equivalent of 290 billion
West German marks ($187 billion).
   Real estate will be especially difficult to sell. Some of it was
seized from people living in West Germany or Jews who fled the
Nazis, many of whom have filed claims for restitution that may be
in the courts for years.
   Wolf Schoede, spokesman for Treuhand, said it was ``the largest
corporation in the world, and it has no precedent and there will be
no successor.''
   Most commentators say Chancellor Helmut Kohl could not have
found a person with better qualifications than Rohwedder to run it,
but Treuhand has taken a lot of criticism in its short life.
   In its Nov. 12 issue, the weekly magazine Spiegel declared that
Rohwedder was unapproachable and had ``quickly shown the door'' to
Heinz Ruhnau, head of the national airline Lufthansa, who wanted to
buy the East German airline Interflug.
   Foreign companies say Treuhand is almost impossible to contact
its procedures are not clear and it favors German investors.
   Tom Sommerlatte, vice president in Germany of the U.S.-based
consulting firm Arthur D. Little, said he had contracts with 12
East German companies that wanted to form ventures with foreign
firms.
   ``We have tried very hard to talk to Treuhand and convince them
of solutions we have found,'' Sommerlatte said. ``Sometimes, they
didn't even receive us; we couldn't get an appointment.''
   When the point was raised during a meeting with foreign
journalists, Rohwedder sighed and said: ``They probably were the
2,087th call we had that day. We have a small number of people
here, too few to accommodate the questions.''
   Treuhand's staff doubled in October to about 500 and will grow
to 1,200-1,500 by the middle of 1991, Rohwedder said. It has
offices in 15 cities of eastern Germany and headquarters on the
Alexanderplatz, the center of East Berlin.
   Its attitude is to favor entrepreneurs and foster competition,
the chairman said. That, he added, was why he backed away from
Lufthansa's attempt to lock up almost all domestic German air
traffic by buying Interflug.
   The unpleasant side of the job is to close companies whose
products won't sell in Western markets. Rohwedder said he had heard
criticism that Treuhand was too slow in shutting some factories and
explained his approach this way:
   ``We could make unemployment very fast, and it would take a long
time to get back to work. We have to work with love for the
people.''
   He denied favoring German applicants over foreigners.
   ``German economic policy is to be open to the outside world,''
he said. ``It stiffens competition, makes people work harder and
benefits the consumer.''
   Rohwedder acknowledge that Germans have the inside track because
many West German companies had good business ties with East
Germany. About 90 percent of the first 200 deals were with German
firms.
   ``The game is played in Germany, so it's only natural the
Germans play the greatest role,'' he said.
   Foreign hotel chains were interested in building in many places,
he said, but that brought up the awkward problem of land ownership:
``We don't know if we own this corner in East Berlin or a Jewish
family that was expelled in 1938.''
   In Dresden, 130 miles south of Berlin, a long street of grimy
factories contains two examples of Treuhand's work.
   Pentacon, a company that made Praktica cameras without regard
for costs to show that East Germany could build an internationally
accepted product, is closing and about 5,000 people will be out of
work.
   Cigarettes, however, are a thriving business. Philip Morris
bought the Dresden factories of the old East German tobacco company
and is turning out 50 million cigarettes a day.
   It has guaranteed the jobs of all 945 workers through 1992,
increased production 30 percent and raised wages $100 a month to an
average $1,050, still less than half what the company pays its
workers in western Germany.

<HEAD>Daily News Strike: Labor's Last Stand?</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   It involves just one newspaper and fewer than
2,500 workers. But to organized labor, which has stumbled from one
debacle to another in the last decade, the Daily News strike has
the feel of a last stand.
   ``These days, every strike like this one seems to be about the
survival of the union movement,'' said James Green, professor of
labor studies at the University of Massachusetts-Boston. ``Union
people ask themselves, `If we lose another one, why are unorganized
workers going to join a union?'''
   And they ask themselves: If we can't win in New York, where can
we win?
   ``New York City is so damn important to the American union
movement,'' said AFL-CIO spokesman Rex Hardesty in Washington.
``Like they say, everything else is Hoboken.''
   With about 40 percent of its work force organized, New York is
one of the few big cities that can still pass for a union town.
   The News strike began Oct. 25 after a paper handler who was
working while seated refused a supervisor's order to stand up,
saying he needed to sit down because of a physical disability. When
other workers walked out in sympathy, the company hired permanent
replacements. Within 24 hours, nine unions were on strike.
   Since then management has been more successful at producing a
newspaper than distributing it. Most newsstand dealers refuse to
sell the News, usually because of striker appeals, threats or
outright violence.
   Circulation has dropped from a million-plus to about 500,000.
And many leading advertisers have pulled out, including department
stores such as Macy's and Alexander's.
   The News battle comes at a crucial period in U.S. labor history.
Union members, a majority of the work force 40 years ago, now
account for less than 20 percent. The last decade was marked by a
series of embarrassing defeats or costly standoffs.
   Against this background, the News dispute is variously described
as labor's Alamo, or its Waterloo.
   ``Certain strikes rise to national attention and become symbolic
strikes,'' says Ronald Filippelli, editor of an encyclopedia on
labor strife. ``They become much more important than the number of
people involved.''
   Local strike leaders have welcomed the attention. Juan Gonzales,
a News columnist, calls the strike ``a decisive battle between
labor and management in the United States. ... The labor movement
is drawing a line in the sand. This trend of breaking unions is
going to stop here.''
   The AFL-CIO has four staffers working in New York and gave the
News unions $100,000 for an advertising and reader boycott campaign
directed by Samuel McKnight, a veteran labor lawyer from Michigan.
   At a rally Nov. 14 outside the Daily News building, leaders of
some of the nation's top unions promised the strikers about
$300,000, and local unions have pledged $2 million.
   If national interest has raised the stakes in the strike, some
wonder if it might also influence the way the strike is conducted.
   When management hires replacement workers - once a relatively
rare tactic, albeit a legal one - unions are reacting with unusual
bitterness, according to Filippelli.
   In labor disputes such as those at the Daily News, Eastern and
Greyhound, ``a message is being sent to unionized employers that
unions might be willing to take a company down if replacement
workers are used,'' he said.
   Ester Fuchs, a Barnard College professor who specializes in
urban politics, questions such tactics.
   ``Because of the boycott, the unions are going to be blamed,
rightfully or wrongfully, if the paper closes,'' she said.
   She also wonders if unions should focus national attention on
this particular strike: ``If they lose under these circumstances,
people will ask how they can win anywhere else. If they win, it's
not a cue for anyone elsewhere, because the conditions in New York
are so special.''
   Strike organizers challenge that assessment. McKnight, the labor
lawyer, said strikes are won by hurting the employer economically.
   Said Filippelli: ``The (boycott) is aimed at getting a
settlement, and I don't think anyone wants to drive the News out of
business.''
   Indeed, the AFL-CIO's Hardesty said the strike can showcase
labor's ability to work with management. He points to the New York
Post, a rival tabloid where unions made extensive wage-and-hour
concessions earlier this year.
   ``We'd like to say to employers, `We know we can go down with
you. We'd like to go up with you,''' he said.

   Egypt gets to write off billions of dollars in
debt. Syria gains more control over Lebanon. China lands a $50
million loan. The Soviet Union wins help restructuring its economy.
   Nations that have joined the U.S.-led effort against Iraq - by
sending troops to the gulf or agreeing to abstain in a key United
Nations vote - are getting a little something in return.
   And those who haven't may find it a little more difficult to get
expected aid from the United States and other countries.
   In the world of diplomacy, there is nothing unusual about a
little exchange of favors, which diplomats call ``quid pro quo.''
   But analysts say Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is pushing
international politicking to new extremes, including high-level
U.S. contacts with nations it has accused of supporting terrorism:
Syria, Cuba and soon, Iraq itself.
   ``Altruism and principle do not always make the world go
'round,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, East-West studies director for
the Council on Foreign Relations. ``Expecting something for your
support is normal, predictable, understandable behavior in
diplomacy and politics.''
   It's difficult to draw a direct link between cooperation in the
gulf and increased aid. Some of the benefits, such as Egyptian debt
relief and help for the Soviets, may have come anyway. But maybe
not so expeditiously.
   And not all of the aid is coming from the United States.
   But Washington's attitude toward a country can make a
difference.
   For example, the Bush administration called on other wealthy
countries to help Jordan only after King Hussein said he would
apply full sanctions against neighboring Iraq.
   And after Yemen voted against a U.S.-sponsored resolution
authorizing the use of force against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, the State Department began reviewing American aid to that
country.
   A department source who spoke only on condition of anonymity
said Yemen's chance of getting $30 million was now ``not as strong
as it might have been.''
   About two-dozen nations are sending troops, ships, planes or
other support for the military buildup against Saddam's
million-member army.
   Other countries have balked at sending troops - Germany and
Japan cite prohibitions in their constitutions - but are helping
those who do and those who suffer most. That also helps keep the
fragile alliance together.
   The U.S. force in the Persian Gulf is expected to reach 400,000
soldiers in the next few weeks. The second-largest force, 144,500
troops, is from the area most directly threatened by Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait, the Gulf Cooperation Council nations of Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and the exiled
Kuwaiti regime.
   Egypt has pledged 20,000 soldiers, along with tanks and heavy
artillery. Syria, which borders Iraq to the west, has 6,500
soldiers in Saudi Arabia and a 15,000-member armored division is to
be added.
   For spearheading Arab support, Egypt is being rewarded in
Washington with a write-off of $6.7 billion in loans used to buy
arms from the United States.
   Even before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, U.S. officials
were looking for a way to relieve Egypt's financial burden. But
Egypt's cooperation helped sell the debt-forgiveness plan to
Congress.
   Pakistan has pledged to send 5,000 troops to the Persian Gulf
and another 5,000 serve as advisers with the Saudi military.
   Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Kuwaiti regime
are lending about $500 million to Pakistan to help compensate for
oil imports cut off by the gulf crisis, according to Kuwaiti
officials.
   Analysts agree that the Soviet Union has made clear it wants
some economic assistance for its support of the Saudi-U.S.
position.
   ``It's an important signal that the Soviets voted for the United
Nations sanctions against Iraq,'' said Jim Phillips, an analyst for
the conservative Heritage Foundation. ``I think they expect food
aid. It's a hazy quid pro quo, but the Soviets are counting on U.S.
goodwill down the line.''
   The Soviets so far have committed only warships but indicate
they would send ground forces under a U.N. command. In return,
Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations aligned against Iraq reportedly
are putting together a multibillion-dollar loan package for Moscow.
   Other countries sending troops include Britain, with 30,000;
France, with 13,000; Morocco, with 1,200; and Bangladesh, with
2,000.
   The support from some nations has been bare bones and clearly
aimed more at showing the flag in an international operation and
warming relations with the United States than seriously aiding the
military effort.
   Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, Argentina, Canada,
Greece, Denmark, Norway, and Portugal all have sent ships to the
gulf, but have stopped short of committing significant ground
forces.
   New Zealand, which has been at odds with Washington since the
Wellington government banned nuclear-power submarines in 1984,
pledged two planes and a medical team.
   Other countries receiving or looking for more U.S. aid also are
kicking in token support. Czechoslovakia is sending a 200-man army
unit and Poland a military field hospital. The Philippines is
putting together a medical team.
   For China, it was enough just not to say no.
   During backstage negotiations leading up to the Security
Council's vote allowing military action, the Asian Development Bank
granted China a $50 million agricultural loan. It was the first
loan by the U.S.-influenced bank to Beijing since the June 1989
crackdown on student demonstrators.
   China, which could have stopped the resolution with its veto,
abstained when the council voted the day after the loan was
announced.
   Then Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was welcomed in
Washington for meetings with Bush and his aides, ending an 18-month
ban on high-level contacts with China.
   Chinese officials denied that they used the U.N. veto power to
gain political favors, and bank officials refused to comment on
whether the loan was linked to the U.N. resolution.

<TEXT>
   A year after police put 51 Vietnamese on a
plane to Hanoi in the only forced repatriation of boat people,
pressure is mounting to resume the controversial policy.
   British colonial officials say forced repatriation eventually
will be seen as the only way to clear Hong Kong's squalid camps of
tens of thousands of refugees, whatever the international outcry
that accompanies it.
   If Hong Kong resumes the policy, United Nations officials
predict other countries in the region will follow suit, returning
more than 100,000 Vietnamese who crowd camps throughout Asia.
   Once back in Vietnam, no one can protect the would-be refugees
from persecution. The United Nations, which monitors boat people
who return voluntarily, says it can do nothing to help those who
are forced to return because it opposes the policy.
   Early next year, the government will consider lifting a
moratorium imposed on mandatory repatriation, said Clinton Leeks,
Hong Kong's refugee coordinator.
   ``It's really our only option,'' he said in an interview.
   Leeks said Western governments are not taking enough of the
genuine refugees and the number of boat people deemed to be
non-refugees, or ``economic migrants,'' is growing.
   Human rights lawyers say they look to the United States, the
sole remaining Western country actively opposed to forcing
Vietnamese home, as a last line of defense.
   ``The U.S. is the only thing that stands between the boat people
and prison planes or prison ships back to Vietnam,'' said David J.
Clark, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong who has
studied the boat people problem.
   American officials insist that U.S. opposition to forced
repatriation remains staunch, but analysts agree that Washington's
policy is linked to its refusal to normalize relations with
Vietnam.
   If Vietnam helps organize elections in Cambodia and participates
in settling the Cambodian civil war, U.S. diplomats say, the United
States may recognize Hanoi by 1992.
   ``The next day, look for forced repatriation,'' a U.S. official
said on condition of anonymity.
   In the camps of tin huts, concrete and watchtowers, the
prospects are depressing to Hong Kong's 52,171 boat people.
   ``We'd rather die that go back to Vietnam,'' reads a sign stuck
on a chain-link fence at Whitehead Detention Center, the biggest of
Hong Kong's 15 camps.
   A year-end report by a Western consulate predicted riots and
bloodshed in the camps if the Dec. 12, 1989, forced repatriation is
repeated.
   ``The Americans should know what kind of resistance the people
from North Vietnam are capable of mounting,'' a police official
said.
   A U.N. official who works in the camps said he believes the
Vietnamese know they are fighting a losing battle.
   Forced repatriation could become unnecessary, he said, if the
Vietnamese realize they have no place to go but home. U.N.
officials have begun telling the refugees since October they should
return home, a radical break with previous policy.
   Since the Vietnam War ended in 1975, more than 1.5 million
Vietnamese have fled since the Vietnam war ended in April 1975. The
United States has accepted almost 1 million Indochinese refugees,
about three times the total of the next three countries -
Australia, Canada and France.
   As a place of first refuge, Hong Kong has borne the brunt of the
exodus, 162,479 arrivals since 1979, but the numbers are declining.
   Only 6,201 boat people have arrived so far this year, compared
with 34,114 in 1989. Resettlements rose to 7,152, a 50 percent
increase from 1989.
   Hope for a solution increased in September when Vietnam, the
United Nations and Britain signed an agreement creating a new
category of boat people, those ``who do not oppose'' repatriation,
to supplement voluntary repatriation.
   Interest in the new category appears low, however. Only 23
Vietnamese were in the first group to return Dec. 1, although 111
had signed up. Interest in the voluntary program also is lagging.
   Although the total number of Vietnamese in Hong Kong declined by
several thousand over the last year, the decrease has been among
boat people who already had been granted refugee status and a
chance to settle in the West.
   People who await screening on their qualifications as refugees,
plus those who flunked the process, have increased from 43,702 in
1989 to 43,949 as of Dec. 3. Also, 2,684 babies were born in the
camps, giving the boat people one of the highest birth rates in the
world.
   ``These increases are intolerable,'' Leeks said. ``What happens
if there's another mass exodus next year?''

   Israel has stopped pumping water from the Sea
of Galilee and the River Jordan has become a dirty, brown stream.
Palestinians often are lucky to get a drip when they turn on the
faucet.
   Israel is suffering a drought, which in the Middle East means
much more than not being able to sprinkle the lawn.
   Water is another of the region's many crises, extending beyond
Israel to Turkey, Syria, Jordan and Iraq. Water is inseparable from
Israel's conflict with the Arabs, and especially the Palestinians
in the occupied territories.
   Agriculture minister Rafael Eitan has run full-page newspaper
ads warning Israelis their country would lose nearly 60 percent of
its water if it gave up the occupied West Bank.
   ``Water is an extremely scarce resource in Israel,'' the ads
say. ``In fact, it is in many ways the limiting factor on the
country's future development.''
   As thousands of Soviet immigrants pour in monthly, with 1
million expected by the end of 1992, everyone fears a shortage.
   Palestinians see Israel's handling of water as another attempt
to drive them from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Water is a final solution to the Palestinian problem,'' said
Saeb Erakat, a professor of political science at An-Najah
University in the West Bank. ``Denying Palestinians water means
`Get out.''
   Erakat turned on the tap at his home in Jericho, an oasis city
since ancient times. A few drops trickled out and he said: ``No
water, no life.''
   Eitan calls Israel's dwindling water sources ``a potential
catastrophe.''
   On Nov. 25, Israel stopped pumping water from the Sea of
Galilee, which supplies about a quarter of its drinking water. The
sea had dropped to within two inches of the level where more
pumping could turn it into a salt lake.
   Reports say the country's underground water also is near the
danger level.
   Predictions are for a late, plentiful rainfall this winter, but
November ended without significant rainfall. A group of rabbis even
held a special prayer for rain.
   The Gaza Strip has more serious problems than the West Bank or
Israel. Open sewers in crowded refugee camps drain into its only
water source, an aquifer nearly destroyed by overuse. Israel
already pumping water in for the few thousand Jewish settlers and
750,000 Arabs in Gaza.
   In the long run, Eitan talks of importing water from Turkey or
Eastern Europe and building desalination plants.
   The reserve army general leads the right-wing Tsomet Party,
which wants to make the occupied lands part of Israel. ``Giving up
control of the West Bank is basically giving up control of the
entire water system,'' said Martin Sherman, one of his advisers.
   Water from an underground mountain reservoir that straddles the
West Bank and Israel now is divided 80-20 in Israel's favor. The
government says this is justified under international law, based on
population figures before Israel captured the territory in the 1967
Middle East war.
   One-quarter of all Israel's water comes from the reservoir. The
ad placed by Eitan's ministry said another aquifer that provides
one-third of the supply would would be affected if a Palestinian
state was created in the West Bank.
   Erakat said 30 percent less arable land is irrigated now than
before 1967, reducing the economic output of the West Bank by more
than 25 percent.
   Shehadeh H. Dajani, manager of the Arab Development Society in
Jericho, used a large map on the wall of his office to point out
land that was irrigated before the occupation.
   ``This is something they have gained after 1967, and they don't
only control the land, but our water from heaven,'' Dajani said.
   Israel has denied taking water that should go to Palestinians.
   According to government statistics, Israelis use twice as much
water per person as Palestinians. A government conservation
campaign has had little effect and farmers have stymied efforts to
raise the subsidized price of water for agriculture.
   As the crisis gets worse, Sherman said, the government will have
to decide who gets water and how much.
   Left-wing legislator Dedi Zucker said water is the deciding
factor in the Palestinian-Israel conflict. ``It will either force
us to cooperate with one another or to kill one another by
thirst,'' he said.
   Neighboring Jordan and Syria have water disputes with Israel.
   ``I would tell the world, if you want to limit the tension in
the Middle East, don't send tanks and don't confuse us with
fruitless talks,'' Eitan said. ``Send water and that will cool down
the Middle East.''
   In Oja, a village outside Jericho, Mubarak al-Nujoum pointed to
fields overgrown with brush and blamed his water shortage on a
nearby Jewish settlement that even has a swimming pool.
   He said more than half his 25-acre farm, which supports an
extended family of 17 people, no longer is irrigated. He still
raises tomatoes, cucumbers and corn, but has stopped growing
bananas because they need too much water.
   Al-Nujoum threw a pebble into an irrigation pond, which he said
was only one-third its normal depth.
   ``These whirls of water are the rings of war here,'' he said.

<HEAD>Danes Reluctantly Prepare for Another Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Danes, who claim the world's
record in parliamentary elections, reluctantly vote again
Wednesday, and the hottest issue seems to be who provoked the
unwanted balloting.
   Conservative Prime Minister Poul Schlueter blames an economic
dispute with the opposition for forcing his election call.
   Even he reflects the country's lack of enthusiasm for its 20th
general parliamentary vote in 45 years. Shlueter says he wants to
``get it over with as soon as possible.''
   Denmark has one of the world's most fractured democracies. It
has not had a majority government since 1971, longer than any other
pluralistic system.
   Schlueter, whose center-right coalition controls just 67 seats
in the 179-seat parliament, has called four elections since 1982.
The latest campaign lacks the trappings seen in those held most
other countries.
   There are no mass rallies in the streets. The size and placement
of campaign posters is severely restricted by law. Paid political
spots are not accepted on state radio or on the two public TV
channels.
   Yet turnout among Denmark's 3.9-million electorate, averaging 85
percent since 1945, is among the world's best.
   Thirteen parties ranging from Marxists to anti-tax crusaders are
competing for the vote. With just 2 percent of the vote needed for
representation, many gain seats - and have emerged as kingmakers
between the evenly balanced main parties.
   Political scientist Steen Sauerberg says many Danish follow
``the liberal ideal of giving the little guy a chance, too.''
   Another reason for the frequent votes, he says, is because there
are no fixed terms for parliamentarians, although there is a
four-year maximum.
   Schlueter, whose coalition includes the Liberals and Social
Liberals, called the vote to settle a minor dispute with the main
opposition Social Democrats on economic policy and taxes.
   Both sides wanted a 6 percent cut at the top of the progressive
tax scale. But the Social Democrats opposed financing it with
reductions in social benefits.
   Unlike in the neighboring Scandinavian countries of Sweden and
Norway, the two main political blocs in Denmark have remained
evenly balanced. Neither the left nor right has managed to get a
working majority, said Sauerberg.
   This allows the small parties often to hold the balance of power
in the parliament, he added.
   But Danish politics, despite its surface chaos, remains
surprisingly stable.
   The voters tend to stay loyal to their party, and support for
the parties swings only a few percentage points after each
election, said Sauerberg.
   All 13 parties get equal time on TV to present their political
platforms regardless of their current strength. They also
participate in a series of debates among all the parties at once.
   The basic flaw in the current campaigns, says Sauerberg, is that
the politicians spend more time speculating openly about possible
coalitions than they do discussing the traditional issues of
employment, taxes and welfare.
   So why do the Danes keep voting?
   ``Simply because of the Danes' sense of duty towards society and
the fact that voter registration is automatic - you get a card in
the mail,'' Sauerberg said.

   With thousands of troops deployed for
Operation Desert Shield, many are looking to increase their life
insurance coverage before they go. That has proven difficult.
   In the same way casualty companies won't write hurricane
coverage when a storm has formed, many life insurance companies are
inserting war exclusion provisions in new policies.
   ``They say if you are killed in a war, the policy is no good,''
said I.C. Russell of the South Carolina Insurance Department.
   The department has received calls from concerned servicemen and
women, but ``there's no mandate by law that says any insurance
company must write you a policy if they don't want to,'' Russell
said.
   The Washington-based American Council of Life Insurance has no
specific numbers on how many companies are putting in exclusions.
   ``But it seems many companies are issuing the war exclusion
clauses for military who have been called to the Persian Gulf,''
said spokeswoman Diane Coffey.
   The council is a trade group representing about 600 companies
nationwide.
   Coffey said policies issued after Aug. 2, when Iraq invaded
Kuwait, could include clauses ``that would stipulate the full
policy would not be paid if death occurred as a result of war in
the Persian Gulf.''
   Policies issued earlier, without the exclusion, can't be amended
to exclude deaths in a Gulf war, she said.
   Coffey urged military personnel to shop around because
``basically each insurance company decides.''
   One insurance company with mostly military customers is the
United Services Automobile Association, based in San Antonio. Of
the company's 2 million policyholders, about 95 percent are active
duty officers.
   The company's new policies don't have war exclusions, but they
do limit the amount of new coverage, said spokesman John Walmsley.
   Officers from lieutenant through captain may buy new or
additional coverage up to a maximum of $250,000, he said. Higher
ranks may buy new or additional coverage up to a maximum $350,000.
For enlisted personnel, the cap is $10,000.
   ``We frankly felt the escalating tensions in the Middle East
needed a prudent business decision,'' Walmsley said.
   Business has increased since the crisis began, Walmsley said,
but he couldn't say exactly how much.
   All troops, including reservists called to active duty, may get
coverage through the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance program
administered by the federal government.
   The government contracts with private companies for the
coverage, said Betty Nahdil, an administrator in the Benefits
Directors Office of the Veterans Administration.
   More than 99 percent of service personnel buy the coverage,
which provides a death benefit of $50,000.
   ``Any military operation not withstanding, they can get this
coverage,'' she said. ``The fact that we are in the Gulf is not
increasing the number of policies we are issuing except among the
reservists who are offered the opportunity.''
   She said 44 claims have been paid for troops killed in accidents
since the Gulf buildup began. Fifty soldiers have died since the
deployment began.

   A wave of fatal shootings, numerous
burglaries and drug trafficking have persuaded some people to hold
onto their weapons despite a ban on firearms in Richmond's public
housing.
   ``I'd rather be safe than sorry,'' said Sondra Davis, 30, who
lives with her 11- and 12-year-old daughters in the Hillside Court
housing project.
   U.S. District Judge Richard L. Williams ruled Dec. 3 that the
gun ban inserted into leases by the city housing authority in
October was ``part of a good-faith effort to improve the safety and
quality of life in public housing.''
   The ruling marked the first time a judge has upheld a gun ban in
public housing in the United States, according to the National
Rifle Association. A Chicago ban on guns in public housing has not
been challenged in court.
   Ms. Davis said she won't be deterred by the rule, under which
violators can be evicted.
   ``Instead of dying or one of my kids getting hurt, I'd just have
to find another place to live,'' she said. ``I'm not selling drugs.
I'm just keeping a gun in my house for my protection.''
   The Richmond Tenants Organization had challenged the ban as an
unreasonable lease restriction that made the city's 14,000 public
housing residents second-class citizens.
   Alma Barlow, president of the tenants group, said her group has
not decided whether to appeal.
   Some residents of the city's 4,500 public housing units said the
ban is a good idea if it helps reduce crime. They said they often
hear shooting at night and have either been burglarized or seen
people breaking into homes.
   ``It's all right with me,'' said Lena Austin, 55, as she hung
laundry outside her Hillside Court home. ``They need to really
buckle down.''
   ``It will probably stop more killing around here,'' said LaToya
James, 18, who lives in the Blackwell complex.
   About a third of Richmond's record 111 slayings this year
occurred in the seven housing projects, said Officer Stephen V.
York, who compiles crime statistics for the Police Department. Many
of Richmond's slayings were drug-related. Richmond had 98 slayings
in all of 1989.
   Nearly 300 burglaries have been reported this year in public
housing, York said.
   ``I'm scared to go out,'' said William Loney, 70, of Hillside
Court. He said he was thinking about getting a gun that he keeps at
a relative's house.
   ``I'll probably do it anyway because if they say I can't keep
guns they're responsible for my life.''

<TEXT>
   In a major Western investment in
Eastern Europe, the German auto manufacturer Volkswagen has won the
bidding war to take over the prized Czechoslovak carmaker Skoda.
   Officials did not say how much money Volkswagen AG was prepared
to invest in Skoda. News reports have put the figure at up to more
than $5 billion.
   Petr Pithart, premier of the Czech republic, said Volkswagen
beat out a French-Swedish consortium of Renault and AB Volvo for
the deal announced Sunday. He said Volkswagen made a better
financial offer, was strong in the European market and provided
better assurances for Skoda's 16,000 workers.
   Skoda is considered one of the best auto manufacturers in
Eastern Europe. It had a manufacturing tradition predating
communism and used its own designs instead of Western retreads.
   Its cars have a relatively good reputation for reliability.
   Auto manufacturing is one of the few areas in which Western
industrial firms have shown a keen interest in expanding into the
formerly Communist countries of Eastern Europe.
   Volkswagen is to take an initial share of 25 percent to 33
percent in the Czechoslovak automaker and gradually increase
control, Pithart said.
   Newspapers have said Volkswagen pledged to keep the Skoda name
and not to lay off employees.

   Reinaldo Arenas, a novelist who spent several
years in prison in Fidel Castro's Cuba and was suffering from AIDS,
died here Friday, and police said it appeared to be a suicide. He
was 47.
   There were no obvious wounds when his body was found in his
Manhattan apartment, but a note was found and investigators
speculated he had overdosed on drugs, said Sgt. Ed Burns, a police
spokesman.
   As a teen-ager, Arenas joined Castro's revolution, and later
worked as a researcher in the Jose Marti National Library. Arenas
said he was branded a social misfit in Cuba because of his
homosexuality, spent time in a labor camp, and was imprisoned from
1974 to 1976 for being a counterrevolutionary.
   His novel ``Singing From the Well'' won the Prix Medici in
France for the best foreign novel of 1969. He wrote the poem ``El
Central'' while in the labor camp, and his second novel,
``Hallucinations,'' was never published in Cuba.
   He escaped to the United States in 1980.
   ``Hallucinations'' was reprinted in in 1987 as ``The Ill-Fated
Peregrinations of Fray Sergando.'' Other works include ``The
Graveyard of the Angels,'' and ``Farewell to the Sea.''

   John Alexander, a tenor with the
Metropolitan Opera for 27 years, died Saturday of a heart attack at
age 67.
   Alexander collapsed Saturday evening at the Temple Theater in
his hometown of Meridian and was pronounced dead at Jeff Anderson
Regional Medical Center.
   He was among a group of local artists on the program to perform
at a fund-raising event that evening.
   Alexander recently retired after 27 years as a tenor with New
York's Metropolitan Opera. He was the first American-born tenor to
establish a reputation for interpretation of 19th-century bel canto
roles, a style of singing that is characterized by brilliant vocal
display and purity of tone and most often associated with Italian
artists.

   Cancer death rates in industrialized nations are
rising faster than aging and smoking might account for, heightening
suspicion that pollution and other environmental dangers are at
fault, scientists say.
   Cancer causes about 2.3 million of the 11 million deaths
annually in industrialized nations, according to one of an
international set of reports collected and published by the New
York Academy of Sciences.
   When lung cancer - most often caused by smoking - is excluded,
the cancer death rate among men in industrialized nations has risen
9 percent since 1950, the report said. Cancer death rates for women
have risen in some countries and fallen in others, it said.
   ``Cancer is increasing in industrial countries above and beyond
that due to cigarette smoking or aging alone,'' said Devra Lee
Davis, an editor of a collection of studies and a researcher at the
National Academy of Sciences in Washington.
   ``The combination of air pollution and industrial activity is
obviously a very important factor.''
   Brain cancer is among the most rapidly increasing, Davis said,
especially among people over 65. In some cases, the rate in the
industrial world has increased more than six-fold in those over age
75, she said. Such cancer has also increased among young people,
although at a lower rate, she said.
   Research shows that in the United States, the rate of lung
cancer deaths among nonsmoking women is now higher than the total
lung cancer death rate in women 30 years ago, she said.
   That could reflect exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke as
well as to radon, asbestos and air pollution, Davis said.
   According to National Cancer Institute figures, the lung cancer
death rate among all American women in 1955 was 5.1 deaths per
100,000 women. Davis and her collaborators calculated that the
death rate in women nonsmokers by 1985 was 6.1 per 100,000.
   Sharp increases are also occurring in a blood cancer called
multiple myeloma and the dangerous skin cancer called melanoma,
Davis said. The rates are climbing in many industrial nations,
including the United States.
   In Italy, Cesare Maltoni and colleagues at the Bologna Institute
of Oncology found that cancer causes nearly 40 percent of all
deaths in the Bologna area, and the rate continues to climb. That's
double the rate for the rest of the country. Bologna is in the most
industrialized part of Italy.
   ``The changes are so great over such a short time in so many
countries in men and women that we need to look carefully for their
causes,'' Davis said. ``These could be very important as clues for
prevention.''
   Although the studies emphasize occupational and environmental
exposures, smoking remains one of the greatest causes of cancer,
Davis said.
   In many industrial countries smoking is responsible for 40
percent of all cancer deaths in men and 30 percent in women, the
studies show.
   Smoking kills an estimted 3 million people each year around the
world, and if current trends continue that will climb to more than
10 million by 2020, Davis said. The combined population of the
industrialized countries studied is about 1.2 billion.
   The studies are collected in ``Trends in Cancer Mortality in
Industrial Countries,'' which will be released this week.
   Although the increases in cancer are clear, the causes are not,
Davis said. Links to benzene, PCBs and other environmental
carcinogens are being considered.
   Among other possible factors, she said, are: a genetic
predisposition to cancer; lifestyle, including drinking and
smoking; the consumption of anti-cancer foods like fresh fruits and
vegetables; exposure to X-rays and infectious agents, and a variety
of occupational hazards.

<HEAD>New Budget Rules Block Major Boosts in Domestic Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As residents of little Middletown, N.Y., brace
for a slowing economy, agencies serving the poor in the Hudson
River Valley community expect more and more people will need help
to pay fuel bills, rent and even find shelter.
   But they don't expect to get the money they'll need from the
federal government.
   ``There will be people wanting services we just won't be able to
accommodate,'' Charles Darden, executive director of Middletown's
Regional Economic Community Action Program, lamented recently.
   With the end of the Cold War last year and before the U.S.
involvement in the Persian Gulf, some lawmakers argued that excess
money from a slimmed-down Pentagon - the so-called peace dividend -
should be used to expand domestic programs.
   Instead, the money will be used mostly to chip away at the
federal deficit. And strict budget procedures written by Congress
and President Bush will keep it that way for at least three years.
   Advocates of these priorities and the new rules say they are
necessary to trim the budget deficit, which is expected to reach at
least a record $320 billion in fiscal 1991, which began Oct. 1.
   ``If we don't deal with the deficit, we won't be able to deal
with any of our other priorities,'' said House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., an architect of the five-year budget
package.
   Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center for Budget
and Policy Priorities, which lobbies for low-income programs in
Washington, criticized the plan.
   ``The problem is not only do we not invest more in domestic
programs, but we don't even give ourselves over the next three
years the ability to debate the issue,'' he said.
   As part of this fall's big budget deal, congressional leaders
and the White House set firm ceilings for each of the next three
years for three separate categories of spending: defense and
domestic programs and foreign affairs. Money can't be transferred
from one category to another.
   Defense spending will be reduced from $297 billion this year to
$296 billion in 1992 - not including the costs of U.S. operations
in the Middle East, which will be counted separately.
   Although that seemingly is a $1 billion decrease, it is $9
billion less than the military would need to keep up with inflation
next year, according to preliminary estimates by the non-partisan
Congressional Budget Office.
   During that same time, spending on domestic initiatives -
excluding benefit programs like Social Security - will be allowed
to rise from $198 billion to $210 billion. But that will be $4
billion less than those programs would need to stay even with
inflation, CBO says.
   Foreign affairs spending will change little from its current
level of $20 billion.
   This means two things. First of all, when the ever-rising cost
of living is factored in, there will be less money to go around for
domestic spending next year. Secondly, the money cut from the
Pentagon's budget is not being spent - it's being used to reduce
the deficit.
   Some officials say that after a decade in which domestic
programs grew little if at all - and considering U.S. involvement
in the Persian Gulf - the added domestic spending is relatively
generous.
   ``I'm not saying we're satisfied,'' said Marsha Simon,
legislative director for Families USA, an advocacy group for the
poor. ``But given the constraints and the past history, I don't
think we could be expected to have done better.''
   Others go even farther, arguing that now is the time to repay
the government's past-due bills.
   ``We went into debt building up our military defenses and
winning the Cold War,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., outgoing
ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee. ``The first thing
we have to do is pay back some of that debt we got into.''
   Even some liberals who were involved in this year's budget talks
say that because of the confrontation with Iraq, it was impossible
to strike a deal pouring more money into domestic programs.
   ``The defense savings aren't as substantial as they should have
been,'' said Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee. ``But it was very difficult to deliver a peace
dividend in the face of a threat of war.''
   The three spending categories will merge in 1994, meaning that
domestic programs will be able to grow at the expense of the
military. But until then, advocates of stronger domestic
initiatives are girding for tough competition for federal dollars
among themselves.
   ``It will precipitate infighting among allies,'' said
Middletown's Darden. ``It will be very stressful.''

<HEAD>Baker, Shevardnadze Try to Wrap Up Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Pre-noon lead expected.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III chose his
hometown to try to wrap up a nuclear weapons reduction treaty with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, but it may take
more than relaxed Texas hospitality to get the job done.
   Between trips to the Johnson Space Center and other diversions
today and Tuesday, Baker and Shevardnadze will review the
conclusions of their negotiating teams and see whether they can
agree on a handful of remaining issues on the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty.
   The toughest is verification - ways to make sure neither side
cheats on terms of the treaty, which will provide for an overall
reduction of about 30 percent in U.S. and Soviet long-range
bombers, missiles and submarines.
   ``I have no doubt that our talks here in Houston will be
productive and that we will continue to tackle some difficult
issues in a constructive spirit,'' Baker said Sunday.
   Shevardnadze, in a brief statement, said in Russian, ``It seems
we have a lot of work ahead of us.'' Noting that the United States
and the Soviet Union have cooperated in some space ventures, the
foreign minister remarked: ``I hope we will further solidify our
cooperation on earth.''
   Hardly anyone is still predicting the treaty will be ready to be
signed at a Moscow summit meeting next month. ``It seems that every
time you solve three issues, there are three more that soar up,''
Jack Mendelsohn, the deputy director of the private Arms Control
Association, remarked Friday in Washington.
   The treaty has been in negotiation since 1982. The major
elements are in place. But some complex problems stand in the way
of completing the accord, such as procedures for exchanging
information about arsenals and how to monitor mobile missiles.
   ``We don't expect the treaty to be wrapped up in Houston,'' said
a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Still, we
hope for completion early next year.''
   President Bush had hoped he could sign the treaty on a visit to
Moscow in January. His summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev will be delayed until the accord is ready.
   Recently, U.S. and Soviet negotiators made major headway by
reaching tentative agreement on three key issues. They sidetracked
a dispute over the Soviet Backfire bomber, decided some banned U.S.
weapons could be turned over to Britain and imposed restrictions on
the launch and payload weight of the Soviets' SS-18 missiles.
   But apart from monitoring arrangements, several other issues are
unsettled. These include the kind of testing information to be
exchanged and whether the Soviets can inspect U.S. B-2 bombers.
   The Soviets sent negotiator Alexei Obukhov and other experts to
Washington for talks beginning last Friday with a U.S. group headed
by under secretary of state Reginald Bartholomew. The idea was to
try to pave the way for Baker and Shevardnadze by clearing up some
of the technicalities.
   The two teams also will be in Houston, hip-deep in details,
while Baker and Shevardnadze talk about the Persian Gulf crisis and
other regional disputes and make a visit to the Johnson Space
Center.
   NASA technicians will try to arrange a phone patch to astronauts
on a shuttle mission so Baker and Shevardnadze can talk to them.
The Soviet foreign minister also will inspect a mockup of the space
shuttle.
   On Wednesday, they will fly back to Washington where
Shevardnadze will meet with Bush at the White House. If the treaty
is ready that could produce announcement of a summit date.
   But U.S. officials are skeptical the two sides can get that far
by Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Your son and 247 other American soldiers are
killed in a plane crash in Gander, Newfoundland, while flying home
from duty in the Middle East. You seek solace from the U.S.
government and you look to Canada for answers about why he died.
   Instead:
   -Some Canadian investigators suggest the plane might have been
bombed.
   -Others say ice on the wings caused the crash.
   -The U.S. government rules out a terrorist connection, even
though it fails to conduct a thorough investigation because the air
disaster occurred outside the United States.
   Five years after one of the worst military aviation tragedies in
history, many families of the victims in the Gander crash believe
the Reagan and Bush administrations are covering up a terrorist
act.
   ``They treated them just like they were a herd of cattle that
went to slaughter,'' says James Godsey, of Newport News, Va., whose
brother was on the Gander plane.
   Invitations sent by the families to the White House to attend a
memorial service have gone unanswered. Pleas to Congress were met
with opposition.
   ``Show me the smoking gun,'' one congressional aide said when a
family member tried to interest him in delving into the crash.
   Seconds before the plane went down on Dec. 12, 1985,
eyewitnesses reported seeing a bright light as if the plane was on
fire. Islamic Jihad, a terrorist group with ties to Iran, claimed
responsibility for the downing of the DC-8. Days before the
disaster, White House aide Oliver North confided to his superiors
that Islamic Jihad might retaliate because Iran was unhapy with a
secret shipment of antiaircraft missiles sent by the Reagan
administration.
   Congress ``let them get by in Iran-Contra'' and now they ``roll
over and play dead'' on the Gander crash, complained Connie Farmer
of Hartsville, S.C., who lost a son in the tragedy.
   She said her youngest son, Aaron, is a ``gung-ho'' Army private
deployed as part of Operation Desert Shield. He plans to hold a
memorial service for his brother, Kyle, Dec. 12 in Saudi Arabia
with some members of the 101st Airborne Division. The troops on the
Gander flight were from the 101st.
   Miami-based Arrow Air operated the plane that carried the
soldiers to their deaths in Gander. The same company shipped goods
to the Contras for North's secret resupply network.
   ``At first, I thought my son died because the government let him
ride home on a piece of junk that was an accident waiting to
happen,'' said Dr. Doug Phillips of St. Petersburg, Fla., a
pathologist.
   Then Phillips found out that many of the bodies in the Gander
crash contained high levels of carbon monoxide, suggesting the
plane was on fire before it hit the ground.
   Phillips and his wife asked the Canadian government to open a
judicial inquiry and they also sought an inquest into the deaths in
the province of Newfoundland. Their requests were turned down.
   The families of the Gander victims finally got someone in
Congress to listen.
   Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., called a two-day hearing of his
House Judiciary subcommittee on crime to examine the U.S. response
to the Gander crash.
   During the hearings last week, the Army, the National
Transportation Safety Board, the FBI and the State Department
emphasized one point: the Canadian government was responsible for
looking into the Gander crash.
   The families have a right to expect more than that from the U.S.
government, Hughes' subcommittee admonished the agency
representatives.
   ``I have thought from day one that the plane was bombed,'' said
Godsey, whose late brother was assigned to special operations in
the Army and trained for rapid deployment and hostage rescues.
   ``I wonder how much taxpayers' money it's going to cost to cover
up this air crash?'' Godsey asked.
   Linda Tatnall, of Hudson, Mass., had a brother aboard the Gander
plane.
   ``I think the government owes us more than a botched
investigation,'' she said.

<HEAD>Spot and Homeless Owner Won't Bow Wow Out of Fight for Pit Bull's

<TEXT>
   Behind the gray bars of doggie
death row sits a pit bull named Spot, tried and convicted of biting
people, but granted a stay of execution while his homeless owner
appeals.
   Spot, 85 pounds of muscle, fur and nervous energy, was found
guilty of biting two people in a late-night scuffle under a fig
tree where owner Ed Mannon sometimes sleeps.
   Spot was impounded and sentenced to die unless Mannon gives the
dog a proper home with a fence - something Mannon says he can't
even give himself.
   ``This wouldn't happen if I had a house,'' said Mannon, 38,
homeless for 10 years. ``I don't know how to be nice about this
anymore. This is just one of the many interruptions the city has
made into my life.''
   Police see it as a public safety matter and say Spot earlier bit
another man.
   ``I think it's a little bit ludicrous,'' said police spokesman
Lt. Richard Glaus. ``We're not in the dog killing business, per se.
We do have an obligation to maintain public safety. This guy
habitually keeps his dog not even on a leash.''
   Spot was sent to the pound after a midnight clash in March in an
area between the freeway and the train tracks where the city's
homeless gather.
   Two people were bitten but not seriously hurt. Mannon contends
they were attacked after they tried to steal a radio and one of 12
puppies fathered by Spot. The puppies' mother, Tina, another pit
bull, did some of the biting, but Spot got all the blame, Mannon
claims.
   Tina does not belong to Mannon.
   Mannon bought Spot for $100 in 1987 and say the dog protects him
from street thugs and once helped him beat a marijuana rap by
eating the evidence.
   At a hearing, a police lieutenant heard anti-Spot testimony from
fellow officers and animal-control authorities. Mannon's defense
included character witnesses and a videotape of him playing with
Spot at the county kennel.
   The lieutenant decided Spot should be killed or kept at the
pound permanently unless he is kept in a fenced yard or on a leash.
   Mannon appealed to Superior Court. He called the proper-home
option a thinly veiled effort to deny homeless people the right to
own dogs. The court upheld the ruling but granted a stay of
execution while the case is under appeal.
   Will Hastings, an attorney with the non-profit Legal Defense
Center, took over Spot's case, which is now before the state
appeals court.
   ``Ed would not have been in this situation and neither would the
dog if Ed had not been homeless,'' said Hastings.

   President Bush did something unusual Sunday
night.
   He stayed home.
   An exhausted Bush, just back from his third foreign trip in as
many weeks, shelved plans to attend a ``Christmas in Washington''
gala at the Pension Building.
   A spokesman, John Herrick, said Bush was ``a little exhausted''
after spending much of the afternoon playing tennis. Bush returned
Saturday night from a week-long journey through five South American
countries.
   Bush was expected to resume a full schedule today, including
meetings with President Vytautas Lansbergis of Lithuania, a group
of black college presidents and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Tonight he and wife Barbara are hosting a Christmas ball for
members of Congress, the first of eight holiday parties this week
and next at the presidential mansion.
   Bush looked tired Sunday morning when he went out to St. John's
Episcopal Church.
   Bush heard a sermon likening Jesse Jackson to John the Baptist
and admonishing people to heed Jackson's calls for racial justice
and equality.
   The Rev. James C. Holmes said people should heed Jackson, the
District of Columbia's new ``shadow'' senator, when he talks about
``the need to turn the racism in our country to justice.''
   ``God has always used imperfect messengers,'' said Holmes, an
assistant pastor. ``If we focus on the imperfections, then we block
out the message.''
   The rector, the Rev. John C. Harper, gave thanks for the release
of the hostages in Iraq and Kuwait, and prayed for Bush, the
American troops in the Persian Gulf and ``those who pay counsel to
the peace of the world.''

   Republican governors were conferring with
their party's incoming national chairman and with top White House
aides today, looking at the political problems and issues that
await the GOP in the buildup toward the 1992 presidential campaign.
   Vice President Dan Quayle was to wrap up the first day of their
annual conference, addressing the governors and then meeting with
them privately.
   White House chief of staff John H. Sununu flew in Sunday to
spend the evening with the governors and returned to Washington.
His deputy, Andrew Card, was on hand for today's meetings. Sununu
is a former New Hampshire governor and his wife, Nancy, is on the
staff of the Republican Governors Association.
   Twelve Republican governors, three governors-elect, and one
Republican who faces a runoff election were attending the two-day
meeting. J. Fife Symington of Arizona won a narrow edge in the Nov.
6 election, but didn't get a clear majority. He and Democrat Terry
Goddard will settle their race on Feb. 26.
   For William J. Bennett, President Bush's choice to become
chairman of the Republican National Committee, the conference was a
debut of sorts - his first formal outing in the new political role.
   He is to succeed the ailing Lee Atwater, suffering from a brain
tumor, and due to move to the largely honorary position of general
chairman when the national committee elects its leaders next month.
   The governors also were to hear from Secretary of the Interior
Manuel Lujan, William Reilly, administrator of the Environmental
Protection Administration, and Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development Jack Kemp.
   On Tuesday, party officials and pollsters appear at the final
conference session to discuss the November elections and the
Republican outlook for the future.

   A natural gas explosion ripped through a
housing complex at the Fort Benjamin Harrison Army post on Sunday
night, injuring at least 10 people, officials said.
   There were no immediate reports of deaths at the post, which
serves as a processing center for soldiers en route to the Persian
Gulf. At least three adults and two children were in critical
condition, a hospital official said.
   Dogs were brought to search the rubble for anyone who might have
been killed, but the dogs were later called off for fear of another
blast, authorities said.
   The explosion, in a housing area for enlisted personnel,
destroyed a four-family housing unit and damaged another unit, said
post spokesman Maj. Ronald Downing.
   Downing, who previously had reported 11 people were injured,
said a later count reduced that to 10.
   The cause of the blast was under investigation, he said.
   Downing said fire authorities had been called earlier in the
evening to investigate a natural gas leak. The evacuation of the
complex had been planned but the explosion at about 9:15 p.m.
occurred before it could be carried out, he said.
   About 210 people living in the Harrison Village complex were
evacuated after the blast, he said.
   Hundreds of firefighters, police, military and emergency
personnel were on the scene late Sunday.
   Large plumes of black smoke curled from the fort area, on the
northeastern edge of Indianapolis. Authorities said callers
reported the blast could be felt more than a mile from the site.
   Rubble was strewn over a four-block-square area.
   State Trooper Anthony Blackburn said he arrived within five
minutes of the blast. ``Insulation was coming down like snow when
we got here. One apartment was engulfed n flames and the other
building was in flames,'' he said.
   Joan Adams said military police began to go door to door about 7
p.m., telling residents that a gas leak had been found and would be
fixed.
   ``He told us there was no danger for us to stay there,'' she
said, but the family decided to leave anyway. Two hours later, an
explosion occurred.
   Three adults and two children, ages 4 and 9, were taken to
Wishard Hospital in critical condition, said hospital spokesman Tim
Johnson.
   Four adults were taken to Hawley Army Community Hospital at the
post suffering from smoke inhalation. At least one other person was
admitted to another hospital.

   Share prices made up early losses to close higher
Monday in Tokyo, while the dollar declined against the Japanese
yen.
   The dollar closed at 130.55 yen, down 1.62 yen from Friday's
finish at 132.17 yen. The currency opened at 130.70 yen and ranged
between 130.30 yen and 130.93 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 262.18 points, or 1.11
percent, ending the day at 23,784.67. The index, a 969.39-point
winner on Friday, was 42.47 points lower at the end of the morning
session.
   Traders said the index's afternoon recovery was helped by the
stability of the yen and government bonds as well as forecasts for
lower U.S. interest rates.
   They said the Nikkei's morning slide was due to profit-taking
following earlier gains.
   In the currency market, the dollar remained lower because of
concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board may further cut
interest rates before the end of the year, dealers said. Lower
interest rates make the dollar less attractive.
   Market players also lost interest in the U.S. currency because
of optimism about the chance for a peaceful solution in the Persian
Gulf following Iraq's announcement it is releasing all foreigners.
   The dollar usually is bought heavily in times of international
tension such as the gulf crisis.

<HEAD>No Flies On This Forensic Entomologist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET McCONNAUGHEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flies and maggots can tell investigators when
people died and whether they took drugs. They can also help solve
cases involving the living.
   M. Lee Goff, a University of Hawaii entomologist who runs a
Honolulu company called Forensic Entomology Enterprises, said
police usually call him to help figure out how long someone's been
dead.
   But last summer he got a different question: How long had a baby
- barely alive and covered with bruises and maggots - been left
near a Hawaii lake?
   ``She was quiet enough that flies had been attracted. Initially,
they were attracted to the feces in her diapers,'' Goff said in New
Orleans last week at a conference of the Entomological Society of
America.
   Based on the maggots' size and other factors, the insect expert
estimated the baby had been there 27 hours.
   He testified at the trial of the child's mother, Sharon Klafta,
32, who was convicted of attempted murder in September for leaving
16-month-old Heathe near the lake in April. The child now lives in
a foster home and the mother is in prison.
   More and more, Goff said, forensic entomologists are called to
testify about abuse to the living as well as about decomposition of
the dead. Goff estimated there are about a dozen forensic
entomologists nationwide.
   ``Some of my colleagues have been showing neglect of the
elderly,'' he said. ``The nursing home will say, `Yes, we clean and
bathe them regularly,' but the maggots have been sitting there and
developing for five or six days.''
   Their testimony is based on expertise on the life cycles and
eating habits of insects that feed on still bodies.
   There are about 230 such insects in Hawaii, and nearly twice as
many in the mainland United States, he said.
   Goff's job gets harder - but not impossible - the longer a
person has been dead, he said.
   He recalled a case in which he examined bones and dirt from a
child's grave. Judging from the beetles, larval skins and mites in
the dirt, Goff estimated the child died 52 days earlier.
   ``When the suspect confessed, it turned out to be the morning 53
days before we were there,'' he said.
   Drug cases are especially challenging, he said. When asked to
find out how long a cocaine user had been dead, he had to do some
experimenting.
   ``I really didn't know if cocaine in the tissues would affect
the development of the flies. I began raising flies on tissue
diffused with cocaine,'' he said.
   Flies and their eggs grew at a normal rate, he said. But once
the maggots began feeding, they growth rate rapidly increased until
they changed into flies.
   He also learned that maggots feeding on a cocaine or heroin user
retain the drug.
   ``As a body decomposes, it becomes very difficult to detect
drugs,'' he said. ``The maggots pick up the drug and store it. You
can analyze the maggot and show the drug was in the body.''

   Paula Abdul was banged up but was not
seriously hurt in a three-car accident involving her Jaguar.
   The pop singer was treated Sunday at Medical Center of North
Hollywood after complaining of pains in her head, neck and upper
body, authorities said.
   Miss Abdul rear-ended a car, which then rammed a third car, said
police Sgt. Al Zardeneta. No charges were immediately filed.
   ``We don't know how it happened,'' Zardeneta said. ``There are
two options - either she was speeding or she was following too
closely.''
   The other drivers complained of sore necks but were not taken to
the hospital, he said.
   Miss Abdul's 1989 debut album, ``Forever Your Girl,'' spawned
the hits ``Straight Up,'' ``Cold Hearted'' and ``The Way You Love
Me.''
   She also choreographed the films ``Coming to America'' and ``The
Running Man'' and won an Emmy for her choreography on television's
``The Tracey Ullman Show.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Frank Sinatra is going home for his 75th
birthday.
   Ol' Blue Eyes returns on Tuesday, the eve of his birthday, to an
arena near his New Jersey hometown of Hoboken to begin a yearlong
world tour. He plans to fulfill a lifetime dream of performing in
the Soviet Union and possibly China.
   As Sinatra grows older - his light baritone has gotten deeper
and richer - he exudes vitality. Still, Sinatra may be thinking
about his age.
   During a toast on an upcoming TV special, he lifts his glass and
says, ``May you all live to be 400 years old, and may the last
voice you hear be mine.''
   After kicking off his Diamond Jubilee World Tour at the
Meadowlands' Brendan Byrne Arena, Sinatra will gather with his
family at a hotel for a private birthday celebration.

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) - One more crack about her producers and Delta
Burke might have to kiss ``Designing Women'' goodbye.
   Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, a producer of the CBS show, said in
next week's TV Guide she has almost lost patience with Ms. Burke,
who has complained for months that she doesn't get enough
recognition and respect on the set.
   ``She seems to be continuing to escalate the situation to a
point where a choice has to be made - and a choice will be made,''
Bloodworth-Thomason said.
   The feud has caught co-star Dixie Carter in the middle because
she considered both women close friends. In the end, she took
Bloodworth-Thomason's side, accusing Burke of attacking the
producer.
   ``There were things that happened and things that were imagined
and distorted,'' Carter said. ``People need to see the forest for
the trees.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Lena Olin of the new film ``Havana'' says love
scenes can be tricky, but Robert Redford was a charm.
   ``He was sweet,'' Olin, 35, said in the Dec. 17 issue of People.
The Swedish-born actress plays a political activist who has a love
affair with a gambler played by Redford in the movie, set during
the Cuban revolution.
   ``Actually those scenes were saved until we had shot for quite a
while, because usually it's good that you get some kind of intimacy
with the person,'' she said.
   ``I mean, I could've done it the first day since he is the way
he is, but it's even nicer when you get to know how sweet he is.''
   Olin starred in ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and won an
Oscar nomination for her role in ``Enemies: A Love Story.''

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) - It's been 24 years since Dolly Parton and her
husband, Carl Dean, have appeared together on stage, and that's the
way he wants it.
   Her Dec. 21 Christmas special on ABC, ``Dolly Parton ...
Christmas at Home,'' will include her mother, father, six brothers,
five sisters, about a dozen aunts and uncles and 15 or so nieces
and nephews - but not her husband.
   ``He's very shy, and not the least bit interested in show
business,'' she said in next week's TV Guide.
   They last appeared together in 1966, the year they were married,
when Ms. Parton had to attend a music awards ceremony in Los
Angeles.
   ``Carl rented a tuxedo for the night, and I won an award for
best song of the year,'' she said. ``But when we got home, he said
`Dolly, I think you're terrific and talented, and I wish you the
best, but don't ever ask me to anything like that again.'''
   Dean doesn't accompany Ms. Parton on the road, preferring to
remain in Nashville, where he owns an asphalt-paving business.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters have given a former guerrilla
army the largest bloc in an assembly that will rewrite the
country's constitution, dealing a resounding defeat to Colombia's
traditional parties.
   As if to punctuate its insistence that leftists can do better at
the polls than in the jungle, the army on Sunday raided the
headquarters of a recalcitrant rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia.
   The attack south of Bogota claimed the lives of 11 soldiers and
as many as 40 rebels, the army said.
   ``Violent groups have lost their argument to persevere in their
practices of hate,'' President Cesar Gaviria said in a televised
speech Sunday night.
   The voting capped a bizarre 12 months in South American
politics. Last December, Brazil elected little-known businessman
Fernando Collor de Mello as its president. In June, Peru selected
Alberto Fujimori, a virtually unknown agronomist, as its president.
   Only about 30 percent of the roughly 12 million eligible voters
went to the polls on Sunday, elections officials said.
   While the overall composition of the 70-member Constituent
Assembly will be conservative-to-moderate, the results marked a
remarkable turnabout for the leftist April 19th Movement, known as
M-19, which laid down its arms in March.
   With 83 percent of the vote counted, M-19 had 27 percent of the
vote and should control 20 seats, political analysts said.
   The governing Liberal Party garnered around 26 percent of the
vote.
   A right-wing splinter group of the Conservative Party, the
National Salvation Party, won 16 percent of the vote, while the
traditional Conservative Party captured around 10 percent. The rest
of the vote was spread among smaller parties.
   The assembly is empowered to reform a 104-year-old constitution
that has been inadequate to handle vast political- and drug-related
violence and extortion, government corruption and desperate
poverty.
   Expected changes include revamping the battered courts, adding
safeguards to curb corruption, and establishing new civil rights
for prisoners.
   Colombia's powerful cocaine cartels are widely believed to have
donated money to assembly candidates, although little hard evidence
surfaced. Candidates rarely mentioned the government's 15-month-old
war on drug traffickers.
   Colombia has been dominated throughout its 160-year history by
the Liberals and the Conservatives.But Sunday, the voters showed
more faith in M-19 chief Antonio Navarro Wolf, a 41-year-old
engineer more accustomed to kidnapping businessmen and hijacking
airliners than making campaign speeches.
   Yet the M-19 victory was oddly characteristic of a group always
better at capturing the imagination than capturing territory in
war.
   The group takes its name from the date of an allegedly rigged
1970 presidential election.
   Its inaugural act in 1974 was to steal the sword of Simon
Bolivar, the hero of Latin American independence. In 1980, the
rebels raided a dinner party and held the U.S. ambassador and other
diplomats captive for weeks.
   Political violence has claimed about 75,000 lives in Colombia
since the late 1960s.
   Drug traffickers killed about 550 people over the past year,
including three candidates in last May's presidential elections, as
they tried to force the government to stop extraditing cocaine
smugglers to the United States.
   Many candidates, including Navarro, were unable to take their
campaigns to the streets for fear of being killed.

   A former hostage from Iraq shouted ``Oh my God!''
as he saw his infant son for the first time, and the two men who
won the release of 21 Americans flown here were cheered, kissed and
given roses.
   The hostages who arrived in Houston on Sunday were part of a
group that Iraq's Saddam Hussein decided to let go one day before
he announced the blanket release of all Western hostages.
   Some of those hostages arrived Sunday in Frankfurt, Germany, and
Americans among them were to arrive today at Andrews Air Force
Base, outside Washington.
   Family members in Houston mobbed former Treasury Secretary John
Connally and oil executive Oscar Wyatt, who secured their loved
ones' release. Three U.S. Embassy employees and seven family
members also were aboard the Boeing 707 operated by Wyatt's Coastal
Corp. that arrived before dawn at Ellington Air Field.
   ``Oh my God!'' shouted Jim Vine of Pasadena, Calif., as he
rushed to throw his arms around his wife, Donna, and son Evan, whom
he had never seen before. The baby was born Sept. 6, about a month
after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Lynda Parker screamed for several minutes when she saw her
husband, Bobby Gene Parker of Vidor, descending the plane. She
dropped to her knees and embraced Parker, who lost about 40 pounds
while he was kept at a military base 25 miles north of Baghdad.
   ``Four and a half months - it's been a long time coming,''
Parker said as he greeted about 40 friends and relatives. ``What
did I miss the most? My family and I've got them all right here.''
   Parker, who worked for Kuwait Drilling Co., said he read a lot
and spent his time listening to Voice of America and BBC radio.
``There was never enough food,'' he said. ``I just hope everyone
will be home for Christmas.''
   Parker's 25-year-old son, Ryan, interrupted a news conference by
Connally and Wyatt to give each man a rose.
   ``This is a very, very small token of appreciation for
everything you've done,'' he said, his voice cracking. ``You've
brought my daddy home.'' He then led a crowd of about 200 relatives
and family members in three cheers for the men.
   Connally and Wyatt met with Saddam for about 45 minutes to
secure the hostages' release. Three Britons and an American living
in England also were freed. They left the plane in Shannon,
Ireland, during a refueling stop.
   Connally and Wyatt donated 15 tons of medical supplies, valued
at $500,000, to Fellowship on Reconciliation, an Iraqi humanitarian
group in Amman, Jordan.
   ``Mr. Wyatt said that if indeed there's an armed conflict, the
presence of a few hundred hostages would not in any way deter the
armed conflict,'' Connally said.
   Most of the former hostages, who looked gaunt and tired, said
they generally were treated well. All complained about food
shortages.
   ``I lost some weight,'' said Allen Lawson of Huntsville, Texas.
``But as far as being mistreated, no I was not mistreated. I know
we sometimes got more food than the Iraqi citizens.''
   Jackie Nelson, wife of former hostage Bill Nelson of Los
Angeles, kissed Wyatt and Connally on the cheek and said, ``God
bless you. I can't thank you enough. We're so grateful.''
   The oilmen, exhausted from the 18-hour flight, were moved to
tears.
   ``That's why we went,'' Wyatt said later.
   ``God Bless America. There's nothing like it,'' said Nelson, who
was held at a munitions plant 37 miles south of Baghdad. ``These
people are marvelous. They have done things our government can't do
and won't do.''

<HEAD>City Government Overhaul Fails in Dallas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voter defeat of a government overhaul designed to
help minorities get elected to City Council means a federal judge
is free to impose a new setup on the city.
   Residents on Saturday rejected by 369 votes a measure under
which 14 council members would be elected from districts and the
mayor would be elected from the city as a whole. The vote was
45,255 in favor and 45,624 against.
   Under the current system, instituted in 1975, eight members are
elected from districts and three others, including the mayor, are
elected from the city at large.
   With the plan's defeat, U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer
could institute the same plan or a similar one and call a City
Council election in May. Mayor Annette Strauss said the judge
indicated he could rule as early as January.
   Supporters said the plan would have helped ease racial
inequities that make it difficult for minorities to get elected.
   Opponents said the system would have resegregated Dallas. They
backed a plan calling for 10 candidates to be elected by district,
four by larger districts, or regions, and the mayor by the city as
a whole.
   The referendum was part of the settlement of a 1988 lawsuit
brought by Roy Williams and Marvin Crenshaw, blacks who failed in
their at-large council bids. They charged that the election system
made it difficult for minorities to win office.
   Black and Hispanic leaders nationwide have long charged that
at-large elections dilute minority voting strength.
   Crenshaw said he was confident the judicial system would not
fail supporters of the 14-1 plan. ``And I think Judge Buchmeyer is
going to take that stake and drive it through the vampire's
heart,'' he said.
   Al Gonzalez, chairman of the 14-1 for Dallas Committee, blamed
the referendum's failure on poor turnout among minorities.
   ``I was shocked,'' he said. ``You can make a lot of excuses, it
was Saturday, if it was pouring, whatever. We should have got that
vote out. The minority community has nobody to blame but
themselves.''

<TEXT>
   A political opponent of Manuel Noriega who helped
U.S. drug agents decipher tapes of the former dictator's phone
calls from jail denied leaking the tapes to CNN.
   The FBI believes Jose Blandon, a former intelligence officer and
diplomat under Noriega, may have been the source of the leak, The
Miami Herald and The Washington Post reported this weekend, citing
unidentified sources.
   However, Blandon said the FBI investigation into who gave CNN
the tapes it has broadcast over the past month should focus instead
on U.S. officials who may want to keep Noriega's drug trafficking
trial from going forward and embarrassing agencies that worked with
Noriega before his downfall, the Post reported Sunday.
   ``Somebody in the government was leaking them,'' Blandon told
the Post. He said that Drug Enforcement Administration agents were
present whenever he had access to the tapes and that he was allowed
to take notes only.
   Blandon said he spent five full days in May and June reviewing
22 of the tapes at the DEA in Miami before describing their
contents to a large group of DEA agents.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Miami has maintained that
prosecutors in the Noriega trial have not been exposed to tapes of
privileged conversations between Noriega and his attorneys.
   However, Blandon said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael P.
Sullivan visited him at his Miami hotel room after the DEA review
and asked for a briefing on the tapes.
   ``I mentioned everything,'' Blandon told the Post, including a
conversation in which Noriega and defense attorney Frank Rubino
discussed how to deal with Luis del Cid, a former Noriega aide who
has pleaded guilty and promised to testify against his former boss.
``I discussed this with Sullivan.''
   After he returned home that weekend, Blandon said, he received a
call from a DEA agent saying the agency urgently wanted a
memorandum describing the content of the calls ``because Sullivan
was asking for that.''
   Blandon said he faxed a six-page memorandum to the DEA on a
machine that was seized by FBI agents during a search of his home
in Houston on Thursday.
   In court documents filed Friday, prosecutors said a DEA agent
reviewed the memorandum and determined that while it spoke of a
call between Noriega and his attorney, this was not a privileged
attorney-client conversation.
   Noriega's defense has asked U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler
to dismiss the drug case, alleging the government's taping of his
phone calls violated his right to attorney-client confidentiality.
The judge has yet to rule.
   Noriega is accused of taking $4.6 million in bribes to protect
the cocaine trade passing through Panama to the United States.

<TEXT>
   The daughters of Martin Luther King Jr. and
Malcolm X, echoing their fathers' split over tactics, divided over
whether to take part in a play in Arizona following the state's
failure to enact a King holiday.
   Yolanda King, a 34-year-old actress, withdrew from the
performance Sunday of ``Stepping Into Tomorrow'' at the University
of Arizona. Attallah Shabazz, daughter of the Black Muslim leader,
kept her commitment.
   The play was performed as scheduled, with a understudy taking
Ms. King's role.
   A statement read on Ms. King's behalf before the show said she
felt her presence ``could and would be misconstrued.''
   ``I believe that the greater good would be served by my support
of this boycott,'' she said.
   The women's split recalled their fathers.' King, who was
assassinated in 1968, said civil rights should be achieved through
non-violence. Malcolm X, who was shot to death in 1965, defended
the use of violence.
   Both women are founding directors of Nucleus, a performing arts
group that has taken the show nationwide for more than 10 years.
   Arizona voters on Nov. 6 defeated two propositions to establish
a paid King holiday. Since then, numerous conventions and other
events have canceled. The National Football League threatened to
withdraw the 1993 Super Bowl from Tempe.
   The Tucson appearance was booked months before the election.
   Ms. King said in the statement that she initially felt her
appearance ``would have a positive effect'' toward resolving the
holiday issue and would also ``inspire young Arizonans who believe
in my father's vision.''
   But it ``became increasingly apparent to me that my presence in
Arizona could and would be misconstrued by some to be contrary to
the goals and tactics of the proponents of the King holiday,'' she
said.
   Ms. Shabazz said she took part because there are different ways
to fight for a cause. ``Some write letters, some hug people, some
protest,'' she said.
   ``If Ms. King thought that we were slapping the cause in the
face then we wouldn't be here,'' Ms. Shabazz said. ``She thinks
physically, as a King descendant, that she should not be here.''
   The show combines music, comedy and drama, using a high school
reunion as the setting to examine such problems as teen pregnancy,
drugs, suicide and peer pressure.

   The dollar fell sharply against the yen for the
second consecutive trading day today, while share prices rebounded
from early losses.
   The dollar closed at 130.55 yen, down 1.62 yen from last
Friday's 132.17-yen finish. It opened at 130.70 yen and ranged
between 130.30 yen and 130.93 yen. The dollar had fallen 1.88 yen
on Friday.
   Spot trading totaled $9.55 billion, up slightly from Friday's
$9.33 billion.
   Dealers said the dollar's low opening today followed
worse-than-expected U.S. jobless figures reported Friday as well as
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's quarter-point cut in the federal
funds rate. Lower interest rates tend to make a currency less
attractive to investors.
   The dollar's decline slowed later as ``investors could not
figure out which way they should push the dollar,'' said Naohiko
Yasuda, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
262.18 points, or 1.11 percent, closing at 23,784.67. The index has
risen nearly 2,000 points since Wednesday. It gained 969.39 points
on Friday alone, but fell 42.47 points in this morning trading
before turning up again.
   The afternoon recovery was helped by the stability of the yen
and government bonds as well as forecasts for lower U.S. interest
rates, traders said.
   The jobless figures announced Friday renewed concerns about a
slowdown in the U.S. economy, said a trader with Nomura Securities
Co., speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``The market is expecting a U.S. discount rate cut to come by
the end of this year,'' he said.
   ``Although trading was volatile because of position adjustments,
the market has been regaining stability gradually,'' he added.
   The Nomura trader said buying by investment trusts and foreign
brokerages helped the index's recovery in the afternoon.
   About 400 million shares changed hands on the first section,
down from Friday's 590 million.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 87.72 points from Friday's
87.31-point close. Their yield fell to 7.120 percent from 7.210
percent.

   The price of gasoline at the pump has barely
increased over the past three weeks despite the new nickel-a-gallon
federal tax, an industry analyst says.
   The average price of a gallon of gas was $1.4606 on Dec. 7, up
.08 cents from Nov. 16, according to Trilby Lundberg's national
survey of 13,600 gasoline stations.
   Lundberg noted Sunday that prices did not jump despite the
5-cent tax imposed Dec. 1. ``Crude oil prices have been softening
for several weeks, therefore gas suppliers were passing through
lower crude oil costs,'' she said.
   She also cited lessening fear of war in the Persian Gulf,
reports of increased oil supply, lower demand for gas at this time
of year and price competition between gas stations.

<HEAD>Small Town, Black Neighbors at Odds Over Martin Luther King
Holiday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When the mayor of this small,
overwhelmingly white town said there weren't enough blacks to
justify a Martin Luther King holiday, he was faced with a minority
that wasn't so silent.
   Blacks in neighboring Kankakee boycotted Bradley businesses.
Now, merchants are worried and village officials are offering an
apology and a holiday.
   But the holiay would leave village offices open, and blacks say
that is not enough.
   ``I think they are sincere and we are making progress,'' said
the Rev. William Copeland, a leader in Kankakee's black community.
``But we're not there yet.''
   Bradley Mayor Kenneth Hayes may not have realized just how close
Kankakee was when he rejected the idea of a holiday on King's
birthday, which falls on Jan. 15 but is being observed on Jan. 21.
   ``Martin Luther King was a great man for the black people. ...
We have five or six blacks in Bradley. Why should we close down
services for the other 11,995?'' he told the Kankakee Daily
Journal.
   Just across the town line, some 10,000 blacks live in Kankakee,
a city 50 miles south of Chicago with a population of about 32,000.
Some of them shop in Bradley.
   At least 2,000 people - black and white - have pledged not to
cross that line in protest against the mayor's remarks, Copeland
said.
   Bradley leaders met with Copeland and other black ministers
Thursday. They offered an unsigned pology from Hayes, hospitalized
in Chicago for lung surgery, and a resolution proclaiming a King
holiday but leaving village offices open.
   ``They're saying they'll celebrate on paper but it will be
business as usual in Bradley,'' said Copeland. ``We want a real
holiday, we want the mayor to sign the apology, and we want a
pledge from them to work for fair housing and affirmative action.''
   Bradley village board member Howard Duchene said Hayes would
sign the apology when he recovered. But he said the village may not
be able to afford a paid holiday for King's birthday.
   Meanwhile, black leaders say a black-oriented fashion show has
moved from Bradley to Kankakee, and blacks have returned Christmas
gifts bought in Bradley and canceled group shopping trips there.
   ``If blacks feel strongly that they were offended, they should
stand up for what they believe, but it's not our fault and I wish
they wouldn't punish us,'' said Mark Viers, manager of NRM Music in
Bradley's new shopping mall. ``The mayor doesn't speak for all of
us.''
   Some residents line up with the mayor.
   ``I cannot believe that in this day and age in a country whose
citizens are supposed to be free to choose, I am being told which
persons' lives to glorify,'' David Albers of Bradley wrote to the
Kankakee Daily Journal.

<HEAD>First Japanese in Space Returns With Craving for Beer, Smoke</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After eight days as the first journalist in space,
Toyohiro Akiyama safely touched down today with down-to-Earth
cravings for beer, good food and a smoke.
   ``It seems like I came back as a mass of desire,'' Akiyama, 48,
said after emerging from the Soyuz space capsule that landed on the
frozen tundra in Kazakstan, the Soviet republic in Central Asia.
   Akiyama, a news director for the Tokyo Broadcasting System, was
the first Japanese in space. He returned with cosmonauts Gennady
Manakov and Gennady Strekalov, who were concluding a four-month
stay aboard the Mir space station.
   TBS paid the Soviets $12 million for Akiyama's rocket fare and
spent an additional $25 million on the project.
   As soon as Akiyama emerged from the capsule, waving and smiling,
he was mobbed by TBS reporters who had raced to the landing site to
beam live to Japan his first words back on terra firma.
   ``Yes, it's very beautiful,'' he said when asked how it felt to
be back on Earth. TBS then arranged for Akiyama to say a few words
to his wife, Kyoko, who had watched the landing from the company's
Tokyo studios.
   ``I'm back,'' said Akiyama, wrapped in a parka and with his
space helmet still in place. ``I worried a bit,'' replied his wife.
   ``Did the kids do all right on their exams?'' he asked.
   ``Why ask such things now?'' she shot back.
   ``I want to eat something good.''
   ``I've prepared it,'' his wife reassured him.
   The saturation coverage by TBS of Akiyama's mission reached a
crescendo with today's all-day live broadcast of the landing, which
came at about 3:05 p.m. local time.
   TBS had rented four helicopters with cameras mounted underneath
to cover two possible landing sites. When a reporter from one of
the helicopters first spotted the capsule plummeting to Earth, he
repeatedly yelled in tones of near hysteria, ``I see it. I see it.
It's there. It's there.''
   Reporters were at the landing site less than 10 minutes after
touchdown, and repeatedly mentioned how charred the capsule looked.
When asked by an anchorman whethe the capsule was still hot, a
journalist at the scene touched the side and reported back: ``I
can't tell because I have gloves on.''
   Akiyama's odyssey in space began Dec. 2 with liftoff from the
Baikonur Cosmodrome, about 1,300 miles east of Moscow. He and two
Soviet cosmonauts linked up with the space station Mir on Tuesday.
   TBS, which sent Akiyama into space as part of the company's 40th
anniversary celebrations, aired exclusive live broadcasts from
their astro-reporter each night that won strong ratings.
   In those reports, Akiyama explained how it felt to be weightless
and to be space sick, which he described as being akin to a
hangover.
   He expressed concerns about global pollution he viewed from
orbit, and even recited Japanese haiku poetry.
   Akiyama also took six Japanese tree frogs into space for
experiments on how they adapt to the weightless environment. TBS
said videotape of these experiments may be shown later.
   Taking along a paying passenger was an important step in the
Soviets' effort to commercialize their space program, and Akiyama's
trip has been a relentlessly commercial affair. Japanese corporate
sponsors, including a diaper maker and a toothpaste company, had
their logos and names plastered on the rocket that launched Akiyama
into space.
   TBS expects to lose $7.4 million on the project, even after
accounting for advertising revenues and proceeds from documentaries
and lectures by Akiyama.

<HEAD>25 Die In Factional Violence As Peace Talks Continue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said today that 25
people died in black factional fighting as President F.W. de Klerk
and African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela continued
efforts to end political unrest.
   Police reported scattered clashes over the weekend, with the
worst violence in the Johannesburg black township of Tokoza, where
13 people were killed.
   Eleven men were hacked and shot to death in the township,
another man was ``necklaced'' with a burning tire and a
six-year-old girl was gunned down, police said. Dozens of people
died in Tokoza last week in clashes.
   De Klerk and Mandela issued a statement late Sunday revealing
they had been holding secret talks on halting the violence that has
claimed about 1,000 lives in the Johannesburg area since August.
The statement said the two leaders had met several times in recent
weeks, including a secret meeting Saturday.
   The statement said significant progress had been made, but gave
no details. It said urgent follow-up steps would be taken.
   The statement said the major problem to be resolved involved the
ANC's suspension of its armed struggle against the white-led
government, agreed to at a meeting in Pretoria Aug. 6.
   The government has accused the ANC of violating the agreement by
continuing to recruit and train members for armed struggle. The ANC
contends it never agreed to end preparations for possible future
armed struggle.
   The ANC suspended its largely ineffective armed struggle as aconcession
in the talks aimed at ending apartheid and setting up
full-scale negotiations on a new constitution.
   The ANC has repeatedly accused government security forces of
instigating the violence between black groups. Much of the violence
has pitted ANC partisans against the mostly Zulu Inkatha Freedom
Party.
   In other developments, Inkatha called at its annual congress for
an end to economic sanctions against South Africa and urged all
black political groups to unite to end factional fighting. A party
resolution passed Sunday urged all black groups to ensure a quick
start to talks with the government.
   ``All scrutiny and all analysis will show that the process of
reform is irreversible, that apartheid is totally doomed and that
all that remains is finally to finish dismembering it and throwing
its pieces away,'' the Inkatha congress said.
   The congress called for the United Nations and the European
Community to adopt ``a rigorous timetable'' for ending sanctions
``as effectively and expeditiously as possible.''
   Inkatha supporters and ANC backers have waged virtual warfare in
Natal province for five years, killing more than 5,000 people. The
fighting spread in August to the Johannesburg area, where some
1,000 people have died.
   The Pan Africanist Congress, the most militant of the main black
opposition groups, concluded its first congress inside South Africa
in 31 years on Sunday by rejecting negotiations with the government
on a new constitution.

<HEAD>Report: Gulf Buildup May Cost Additional $20 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon may have to ask Congress for up to
$20 billion more to cover the Persian Gulf buildup, The New York
Times reported today.
   The costs of the operation have risen sharply because of plans
to add up to 200,000 troops to the U.S. forces already in the
region, the newspaper said.
   U.S. officials said the request reflects an estimate that the
Persian Gulf operation could cost as much as $31 billion, the Times
said. It said that contributions from American allies might offset
less than half of that amount.
   Despite the unknowns, such as what the precise cost will be and
how much allies will contribute, a senior Pentagon official quoted
by the Times said Congress may be asked to allot $16 billion to $20
billion more when lawmakers reassemble in January.
   Before the Nov. 8 decision to add troops to those already in the
Persian Gulf, it was estimated Congress would have to allot about
$5 billion during the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   The anticipated 1991 costs of the deployment will have no impact
on the budget agreement struck last fall. The agreement omitted
expenses for the gulf operation because they could not be
calculated.
   There was no immediate indication of whether the additional
costs would be covered through higher taxes or through borrowing,
the Times said.

   Unseasonably mild and dry weather prevailed across much of the
nation today, although rain fell across the Pacific Northwest.
   Temperatures dipped to below freezing in the Deep South, but
reached the 30s and 40s in most of the rest the nation.
   Portions of the Rocky Mountain states and the extreme northern
tier of the Plains and Great Lakes had temperatures below 30
degrees.
   Birmingham, Ala., was 31 degrees early today, the same as
Bismarck, N.D.
   High pressure in the Plains was expected to bring record warmth,
with temperatures about 25 degrees above their season norm.
   Temperatures will drop 10-15 degrees in the upper Midwest, after
record high temperatures Sunday.
   Flurries are possible in the northern mountains of New England,
along the southern shorelines of lakes Erie and Ontario, and the
mountains of Idaho and Montana.
   A cold front will sweep across New England today, ushering in a
blast of winterlike temperatures.
   The nation's high on Sunday was 87 degrees at Camp Pendleton,
Calif.

<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Deane C. Davis, who pushed
through legislation to protect Vermont's environment, has died at
age 90.
   The two-term Republican, who served from 1969 to 1973, died
Saturday at Central Vermont Hospital in Berlin of complications
from gall bladder surgery.
   The scion of a farming family, Davis, a lawyer, had neither
served in the Legislature nor held statewide elective office when
he ran for governor in 1968.
   In 1970, Davis had one of the most successful legislative
sessions ever enjoyed by a Vermont governor.
   Legislators enacted a pioneering law that controlled major
development projects by establishing how they would be evaluated;
an innovative water quality law, and legislation restructuring the
government into superagencies.
   In April 1970, Davis presided over Vermont's first Green-up Day,
a project to clean up the state. More than 70,000 people helped
remove 4,000 truckloads of trash from interstate highways.
   At age 9, Davis became a member of the first Boy Scout troop in
America.
   In 1940, he served as general counsel for the National Life
Insurance Co. in Montpelier. Ten years later he became president of
the company, which he helped build into one of the biggest firms in
the nation.
   In retirement, he wrote two books of Vermont humor. His memoirs
are scheduled to be published in the spring.
   Davis' first wife, Corrine, died of cancer. In 1952, he married
Marjorie Smith Conzelman.
   Davis is survived by his wife;, a son; a daughter, and a sister.
   A funeral is scheduled for Wednesday.

<HEAD>Army Replaces Ershad Loyalists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army has replaced three senior
officers loyal to ousted President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, and
mayors appointed by the former president also will be replaced,
sources said today.
   Ershad, a former general who seized power in 1982, bowed to
public pressure last week and handed over power to a caretaker
government led by Supreme Court Chief Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed.
   Shahabuddin has appointed nine advisers to preside over the
affairs of state while he prepares parliamentary elections to be
held early next year.
   Sources close to Ershad's government said the army had replaced
Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ashraf Hossain and Brig. Nasiruddin Ahmed, the
two senior intelligence officers, along with Gen. Abdus Salam, the
quartermaster-general.
   The intelligence officers were part of Ershad's crisis team,
which met almost daily during the seven-week campaign of street
demonstrations and strikes organized to press for his ouster, the
sources said.
   They said all three men had been appointed officers ``on special
assignment,'' presumably positions without power.
   There was no official confirmation of the command changes.
   The Morning Sun newspaper reported that the caretaker government
had also removed Saiful Bari, chairman under Ershad of state-run
radio and television, and Mosarraf Hossain, secretary of the
industries ministry.
   Shahabuddin's advisory council met for the first time Sunday and
moved to replace the mayors of Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi and
Khulna, and the chairmen of 61 of the country's 64 district
councils, according to an announcement published today in major
newspapers.
   Only Bangladesh's four largest cities have mayors. The rest of
the country of 110 million to 120 million people is divided into
administrative districts.
   The popularly elected chairmen of three districts in the
Chittagong Hill Tracts will keep their jobs. The other chairmen
were appointed by the president.
   The English-language Morning Sun said Ershad was seeking
possible political asylum in the United States, Britain, Australia
or Pakistan.
   U.S., Australian and Pakistani diplomats denied any knowledge of
such a request. British diplomats could not be located for comment
because their embassy was closed today.
   Ershad was secluded Sunday at his home in Dhaka's cantonment,
home to senior military officers. Several other members of his
government were in hiding, fearing attacks if they appear in
public.
   The former president's opponents are divided over whether to let
Ershad leave the country or to prosecute him, as is demanded by the
students who sparked the campaign that led to his demise.

<TEXT>
   A football captain who wants to build an
inner-city school is among 32 Rhodes Scholars chosen to study at
Oxford University in England for two years.
   The 1991 U.S. Rhodes scholars announced Sunday were chosen
during meetings held nationwide Wednesday and Saturday, said David
Alexander, the American secretary of the Rhodes Scholarship Trust
based at Pomona College in Claremont.
   The winners include a Baptist minister, a student fluent in four
languages, four English majors, five political science majors and
two pre-med students. Several scholars said they planned careers in
education.
   Darcy D. Prather, an inside linebacker at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said Sunday his eventual goal is to start
a school in Chicago or St. Louis that would ``address deficiencies
of students in science and engineering.''
   Prather will study politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford.
   Harvard University had five scholars, Yale had four, and
Williams College and the U.S. Air Force Academy each had two.
   The new scholars include 27 men and five women. Women have been
eligible for the scholarships since 1976, and 157 have participated
in the program.
   Among the qualities sought in Rhodes scholars are proven
intellectual and academic excellence, integrity, respect for
others, ability to lead and to use talents fully, and sports
prowess. Applicants must be single and between the ages of 18 and
24.
   ``It's renewing to be among so many candidates this year who
care about education and teaching,'' said Goodwin Liu, a biological
sciences major at Stanford University and a tennis instructor.
   Liu plans to study human sciences at Oxford.
   The University of Virginia's Brad Ronnell Braxton is a religious
studies major who is already a licensed Baptist minister. He plans
a career in the ministry and college teaching.
   Sabina Alkire, who majored in sociology at the University of
Illinois, worked in Pakistan, India and Guatemala. She speaks
Spanish, Hindi and Urdu and plans to study theology at Oxford.
   Carl D. Marci, a pre-med student at Columbia University,
conducted a study last year for an AIDS support group that delivers
hot meals to people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   He plans to major in public health.
   The Rhodes scholarships were established in 1902 by the estate
of Cecil Rhodes, a British philanthropist and colonialist, who had
hoped they would contribute to world understanding and peace.
   Scholarship winners have educational fees and living expenses
paid.
   Former Rhodes scholars include Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,
entertainer Kris Kristofferson, former Los Angeles Rams quarterback
Pat Haden and U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter.

   Lorin Hubbard says he felt no fear as
he waited for American bombs to fall on the Iraqi ammunition plant
where he was held as a human shield.
   ``We were hoping they'd blow the place up,'' the angry, tired
Boeing aircraft executive said as he trudged through the Frankfurt
airport, a free man after four and a half months as a vulnerable
pawn.
   Hubbard, 66, was among scores of Westerners taken hostage by the
Iraqis and designated human shields, dispatched to areas the Iraqis
considered vulnerable to a U.S. attack.
   He said he and his wife, who had lived in Kuwait City for more
than five years, were picked up in Kuwait City by Iraqi troops
shortly after the Persian Gulf nation invaded the tiny emirate.
   He and about 40 other foreigners were taken to Baghdad ``in an
unair-conditioned bus in the heat of the day, babies and
everything.''
   He said they were farmed out to other locations, and that he and
his wife were held in an office at a munitions plant about 40 miles
west of Baghdad.
   The composition of the nationalities he was with changed with
the diplomatic overtures made by various countries.
   ``They'd take the French out, then they'd bring somebody else
in, then they'd take the Germans out,'' said Hubbard, who is from
Seattle.
   ``We had no idea when we'd get out,'' he said. ``Nobody knew
where we were, as far as I know.''
   Asked if he felt in danger to a U.S. attack on the ammo factory,
Hubbard said:
   ``I want to see them make a hole in the ground at that place,''
he said. ``We were hoping they would. I hope they blow it up.''
   Many other former hostages expressed rage when their ordeal
finally ended. Several who managed to avoid detection in Kuwait
said they were aided by an organized underground of Kuwaiti
citizens.
   Don Latham, an engineer from Albuquerque, N.M., said he worked
with a Kuwaiti resistance that called itself ``The Guardians.''
   ``The last thing I saw was a Kuwaiti family that had given
refuge to an American citizen,'' he said. ``They (the Iraqis)
killed seven members of the family.''
   He said he photographed the body of a 12-year-old boy.
   ``Those murdering bastards,'' he said.
   Latham, 51, said that he went underground with his 70-year-old
stepfather, who had come to visit him just two days before the
invasion.
   ``Several families put us up,'' he said. ``The resistance is not
totally violent. They're much more concerned with taking care of
the people, getting food, not just to the Kuwaitis, but anybody.''
   Ernest Alexander, originally from Media, Penn., ran a law firm
in Kuwait and also spent the time since the invasion in hiding,
aided by the Kuwaiti underground, he said.
   He said he believes Kuwaitis would welcome a U.S. military
effort.
   ``They all do to every man to every woman to every child, even
if it means they're all under a rain of bombs,'' said Alexander,
39.
   ``It was very demoralizing to find (Americans) suggesting that
sanctions ought to go on for a year, 18 months.''
   Pete Dooley arrived in Kuwait in February to run a string of
restaurants for his company. He said he hid in his apartment during
the siege.
   ``They came to the door, but I didn't answer,'' said the
40-year-old resident of Hopkinsville, Ky.
   He said Kuwaitis and some Palestinians helped him get around.
``Very many people have left,'' he said. ``Everybody that could
leave is gone.''
   He said he was looking forward to going home.
   ``My mother is going to bake me a meat loaf,'' he said.

   A newspaper reporter was free today
after spending two days in jail for refusing to answer questions
about interviews she conducted with a man on trial for murder.
   Libby Averyt, 26, of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times was freed
Sunday after prosecutors agreed to allow District Judge Eric Brown
dissolve contempt charges against her, the newspaper reported.
   Brown had ordered Ms. Averyt jailed Thursday on contempt charges
after she invoked the First Amendment and similar provisions of the
Texas Constitution after refusing to answer 12 questions about
conversations she had with Jermarr Arnold. She was jailed Friday.
   Averyt and the newspaper's attorney, Jorge Rangel, maintained
that journalists should not be compelled to reveal information
obtained from news sources if that information was not published.
   Arnold stands trial for the 1983 slaying of 21-year-old jewelry
store clerk Christina Sanchez. The trial is scheduled to begin
Wednesday.
   At a meeting Sunday with prosecutors and the judge, Rangel said,
``I told everyone present that Libby was not going to change her
mind and was not going to answer the questions.'' He urged that she
be freed since, he argued, further jail time would not change the
situation.
   Rangel said Ms. Averyt is still under subpoena for Arnold's
murder trial.
   If called to testify, Ms. Averyt said, ``I'm not going to answer
any questions about unpublished material.''
   ``Libby made a very strong statement, that she was willing to go
to jail on behalf of a principle,'' said Larry Rose, executive
editor of the Caller-Times. ``I believe it sends a statement that
news reporters are not going to let themselves become investigative
arms of the state.''
   Ms. Averyt said among the first things she planned to do after
getting out of jail was ``to take a hot bubble bath and talk to my
husband.''

   Astronomer Bill Blair has been
waxing poetic over Columbia's star-crossed mission for months, much
to his colleagues' delight.
   The research scientist at Johns Hopkins University started
giving songs and poems a shuttle twist long before fuel leaks
halted the mission's fourth countdown in September. He is part of
the team managing the university's ultraviolet telescope aboard the
shuttle.
   One of his first efforts at fine-tuning songs was with ``Fifty
Ways To Leave Your Lover.'' He wrote four or five versions of the
song - all called ``Fifty Ways To Lose Your Pointings'' - based on
problems simulated during training that came true after launch.
   Another lyric, happily, was not so prescient: ``We'll be
launched by Christmas, but only in our dreams.''
   ``Since we got launched by Christmas, I never fleshed that one
out the rest of the way,'' he said, laughing.
   Other team members have come up with occasional lyrics about the
mission, which was delayed by fuel leaks for months before the Dec.
2 launch and has been hampered by technical problems since. But
Blair, 37, goes that one further.
   ``It's just been sort of a joke,'' he said. ``Rather than just
saying one phrase from a song at the dinner table and we all laugh
about it, I sit down and do a whole song.''
   His latest effort - ``The Night Before Astro'' - was beamed up
to the astronauts on Columbia during a science briefing late
Saturday night. The poem is filled with acronyms decipherable only
by space-savvy types. A sample:
   ``In the POCC back in Huntsville we sat and we waited
   ``Although more than one veteran's mood was quite jaded.
   ``The countdown went smoothly, the APUs worked.
   ``The SRBs fired, it lurched and it jerked.
   ``It cleared the launch tower, we hooted and whistled.
   ``And away they all flew on the back of that missile.''
   Blair said he came up with the idea for the holiday poem after
he arrived at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.,
just prior to last week's launch. Marshall houses the Payload
Operations Control Center - POCC, pronounced pock.
   ``I was working the night shift, and little phrases of it kept
going through my head, usually at two in the afternoon when I was
supposed to be asleep,'' Blair said. ``I just got inspired enough
to finish it.''
   Blair said he wanted to include personal notes about the
astronauts in the poem, ``but I just ran out of gas.''
   Blair currently is altering the lyrics of ``Deck the Halls.''
   ``I keep trying to stop. I should be sleeping, not doing this on
my off-shift time,'' he said early Sunday evening before reporting
to work.
   ``I'm working on `Deck the halls with plots of data.' I haven't
gotten the rest of it yet, but I'm working on it. We're delighted
to be getting some data, believe me. It's taken a long time.''

<TEXT>
   Actress Joan Bennett, who played
opposite Katharine Hepburn in ``Little Women'' and was Elizabeth
Taylor's mother in ``Father of the Bride,'' has died at age 80.
   Miss Bennett died Friday night at White Plains Hospital after
suffering a heart attack at her home in Scarsdale north of New York
City, said her husband, David Wilde.
   ``I don't think much of most of the films I made,'' she said in
1986. ``But being a movie star was something I liked very much.''
   Among her 75 film credits are the 1933 classic ``Little Women,''
in which she played one of the sisters, as did Miss Hepburn.
   In Vincente Minnelli's 1950 comedy ``Father of the Bride,'' Miss
Bennett played a nurturing mother, shedding the husky-voiced
presence she had developed for Fritz Lang's thriller films.
   Miss Bennett's film credits also include ``For Heaven's Sake,''
and ``Desire in the Dust.''
   In 1951, she was the protagonist in a Hollywood scandal when her
then-husband, producer Walter Wanger, shot and wounded her agent,
Jennings Lang, in a Los Angeles parking lot. Wanger suspected Lang
of having an affair with Miss Bennett.
   The actress, born in Fort Lee, N.J., made her 1928 debut in the
Broadway play ``Jarnegan.''
   Miss Bennett appeared on stage in ``Stage Door,'' ``Pleasure of
His Company,'' ``Fallen Angels'' and ``Butterflies are Free.''
   In 1978, she acted in the TV movie ``Suddenly Love,'' followed
by ``A House Possessed'' in 1980 and ``Divorce Wars'' in 1981.
   She also played Elizabeth Collins in the gothic soap opera
``Dark Shadows.'' The serial, which ran from 1966 to 1971,
attracted a cult following and gave her a new generation of fans.
   Miss Bennett was first married when she was 16 and had four
husbands.
   In addition to Wilde, she is survived by four daughters, Shelley
Wanger and Stephanie Guest, both of New York City; Diana Anderson
of Los Angeles; and Melinda Bena of Chappaqua, N.Y.
   She will be cremated and buried in Old Lyme, Conn., Wilde said.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
accepted the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize in absentia today. He said
problems in his homeland prevented him from coming to the awards
ceremony.
   ``I do not regard the the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize as an award to
me personally, but as a recognition of what we call perestroika and
innovative political thinking, which is of vital significance for
human destinies all over the world,'' Gorbachev said in a message
from Moscow.
   In an acceptance speech read by his envoy, Anatoly Kovalyov,
Gorbachev promised to continue the process of openness and reform.
Kovalyov said the prize's $715,000 cash award probably would be
donated to worthy causes.
   Nobel prizes in physics, chemistry, literature, medicine and
economics were to be awarded later today in Stockholm, Sweden.
   The Norwegian Nobel Committee said the 71st Peace Prize
recognized Gorbachev's international efforts, more than his
domestic policies.
   But committee leader Gidske Anderson said at the Oslo City Hall
ceremony that she hoped the award would be seen as ``a helping hand
in an hour of need'' as Gorbachev and the Soviet people cope with
the restructing of their economy and government.
   ``This transformation is inevitably a painful porcess, involving
great sacrifice,'' she said. Norway's royalty, government leaders
and roughly 900 guests applauded as Anderson presented the Peace
Prize medal and diploma to Gorbachev's stand-in.
   Gorbachev had hoped to attend the ceremony in person, but last
month said problems at home required his attention ``hour by
hour.''
   Demonstrators in Moscow protested the award Sunday and today,
blaming Gorbachev for ethnic and political violence in his own
country.
   Gorbachev, quoting the 18th Century German philospher Immanuel
Kant, said in his acceptance speech: ``Kant prophesized that
mankind would one day be faced with a dilemma: either to be joined
in a true union of nations or to perish in a war of annihilation
ending in the extinction of the human race.
   ``Now, as we move from the second to the third millennium, the
clock has struck the moment of truth,'' Gorbachev wrote.
   The year 1990 represents a turning point, he said. ``It marks
the end of the unnatural division of Europe. Germany has been
reunited. We have begun to resolutely tear down the material
foundations of a military, political and ideological
confrontation.''
   An unofficial translation of Gorbachev's two-page statement said
the Peace Prize recognized that perestroika and reform no longer
belong to Soviets alone.
   ``They are the property of the whole of mankind and are an
inseparable part of its destiny, and of a safe, peaceful future,''
the text said.
   Gorbachev thanked Norway, and the West, for supporting the
Soviet Union's struggle to adopt greater openness and freer markets
- a struggle that has unleashed anger, protests and frustation in
his own country due to shortages of food and products.
   But Anderson said the 1990 award very much reflected the wishes
of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite who endowed the
Nobel prizes in his 1896 will.
   ``Nobel wanted the prize to be awarded to someone who had worked
to promote `fraternity between nations' ... to someone who actively
promoted a reduction in `standing armies' and worked for the
`holding of peace congresses,''' she said in her prepared remarks.
   Gorbachev is the the third eastern European who has not received
his prize in person since 1975.
   ``The award this year ... is an historic event not least because
of some of the previous awards made by our committee,'' Anderson
said.
   She said the 1975 award to Soviet human rights champion Andrei
Sakharov and the 1983 award to Poland's Lech Walesa were greeted
``with cool hostility in the Soviet Union and Poland.''
   Neither laurate was able to attend the ceremony, and their
governments rejected everything the committee stood for, she said.
Now the Soviet president has accepted the same award.

   More than 150 Americans, some looking
gaunt and weary after more than four months as hostages in Iraq and
Kuwait, flew to the United States today aboard a chartered
jetliner.
   Four Canadians and 152 Americans left Frankfurt on a Pan Am
plane headed for Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, U.S.
consular officials said.
   Hamburgers and champagne were among the provisions on the jet.
   The flight left Frankfurt at 2:26 p.m. About 13 hours earlier,
an Iraqi Airways airliner delivered the former captives, about two
dozen other Americans and 101 Britons to Frankfurt airport.
   Some of the Americans who arrived in Germany from Iraq after
midnight Sunday were to return to the United States on later
flights.
   The former hostages said they had a scare as the 747 descended
into Frankfurt from Baghdad. The plane began to shudder as it
approached the runway, and the landing was aborted.
   No explanation was given, but the second landing attempt was
uneventful.
   After a few hours sleep, the Americans - some of whom lost up to
40 pounds during their captivity - awoke to a huge breakfast of ham
and eggs, bacon, corn flakes and hash browns.
   ``I wallowed in the ham,'' said former ``human shield'' Chris
Folsom, 51, of Doylestown, Pa.
   Two of the men who had been hiding in Kuwait planned to fly
directly home to Albuquerque, N.M., to bypass the hostage
homecoming as a protest against the administration's handling of
their release, a relative said.
   Ruth Kho said her father, Eugene Hughes, and his stepson Donald
Latham ``have some hard feelings toward the United States
government.''
   ``The Voice of America didn't broadcast that they could come out
of hiding,'' she said. As a result the men took a chance in coming
to the airport in Kuwait City, where they were forced to wait in
the desert for eight hours before being flown out Sunday, she said.
   Iraq's parliament on Friday approved a decree by President
Saddam Hussein to release the estimated 8,000 American, European
and Japanese citizens who had been forbidden from leaving Kuwait
and Iraq.
   U.S. officials said they planned to charter another flight from
Baghdad in three or four days to evacuate the rest of the estimated
750 Americans in Iraq and Kuwait.
   The flight to Frankfurt included about 80 Americans who had been
stranded in Kuwait for more than four months following the Aug. 2
Iraqi invasion.
   They told of hiding in crawl spaces with little to eat, of an
underground resistance that helped foreigners, and of brutal
treatment meted out to Kuwaitis by the occupying army.
   ``Kuwait City no longer exists. It's dead,'' said Latham, 51, an
engineer.
   Latham, who lived in Kuwait City for five years, said his
70-year-old stepfather had come to visit him two days before the
Iraqi invasion.
   ``We've been in hiding ever since. We've been working with the
Kuwaiti resistance,'' he said.
   He said there is an organized underground called ``The
Guardians,'' who set up a food distribution network and a system to
help underground foreigners.
   ``They are not so much concerned with killing Iraqis as with
taking care of the people,'' Latham said.
   Thomas Kreuzman, 38, of Holiday, Fla., said he spent 23 days
hiding in an air-conditioning duct with his dog. They lived on dry
spaghetti and sneaked out at night for water, he said.
   Randal Warren, 49, a construction worker from Charleston, Mo.,
described hiding out on the top floor of an apartment house,
keeping the curtains closed the entire time and wearing no shoes to
hold down the noise.
   A Palestinian and a Turkish friend brought supplies about every
two weeks, Warren said. ``This is the first time I have had shoes
on in over three months.''
   The freed hostages also included so-called ``human shields'' who
had been kept at strategic locations in Iraq.
   Robert Vinton, of Santa Fe, N.M. said he was held south of
Baghdad at an oil refinery. He said he was picked up Aug. 18 on a
Baghdad street.
   ``It was like a gulag,'' the 58-year-old Vinton said. He was
held with up to eight other foreigners at a time, he said, though
he added: ``We were mostly left alone.''
   Joseph Lammerding, 35, of Sacramento, Calif., said that after
visiting his parents he plans to return to the gulf to help push
the Iraqis out of Kuwait.
   Lammerding, who spent four months in hiding in Kuwait, said the
Iraqis brutally retaliated against Kuwaitis who were trying to
offer resistance and protect foreigners.
   ``Sometimes they would shoot one member of a family. Sometimes
the entire family. They raped and plundered, literally,'' said
Lammerding, who described himself as an adviser to the Kuwaiti
military who had lived in the emirate since 1983.
   But the hostage crisis wasn't hell for everyone.
   David Dorrington, 43, said he spent most of the crisis hidden
with five other Britons in a villa in Kuwait.
   ``Our basic living conditions were embarrassingly rather good.
We had very good help from our Filipino maid who supplied us with
everything and was absolutely magic,'' he said.
   But three weeks ago, Dorrington said, he was arrested and taken
to Baghdad.
   A Dutchman who flew to Rome early today said he was not
mistreated, although he was unable to leave Baghdad. Unlike many
American and British hostages, the Dutch weren't forced to serve as
``human shields.''
   ``Circumstances in Baghdad were fairly normal ... We were able
to go shopping, get food and move around freely,'' Mario Punte said
in Amsterdam, where he arrived from Rome.

   Club-wielding police fought student
demonstrators the Albanian capital who staged a rare show of public
defiance against the Communist government, but diplomats said there
were no new clashes today.
   A diplomat reached by telephone in Tirana said there were
injuries and arrests in Sunday's clash, but he did not know how
many.
   The diplomat said without citing a source that more
demonstrations had been planned for today, but by noon there were
no street gatherings, nor any sign of an increased police presence.
   Talks between students and the government, reportedly opened
after Sunday's protest, may have eased the tensions.
   First word of the clash in Tirana came in an unusually frank
dispatch from the government-controlled news agency ATA.
   It appeared to be the first instance in which ATA was the first
to report a confrontation between police and demonstrators in the
isolationist Balkan country.
   The agency even indicated, without providing specifics, that the
students who took to the streets were critical of Communist
authorities.
   It said the students were angry about a power outage that left
their dormitories without heat and light, and that demonstrators
had tried to exploit dissatisfaction over the lack of heat for
``political ends.''
   The students ``provoked the order forces and acted contrary to
the law,'' the agency reported. ``Security forces were forced to
interfere in order to disperse them.''
   ATA said negotiations subsequently began between student
representatives and the minister of education, and that a
government commission was being formed to adopt ``measures to
stabilize the situation'' and address the students' demands.
   The four-paragraph ATA dispatch did not say how many students or
police were involved, did not elaborate on what demands the
protesters had and contained no other substantive details.
   One diplomat said ``a great many students'' took part in the
demonstration near the university but a ``strong'' police force
encircled the area, then attacked the protesters with clubs.
   ``There certainly were injuries because fights occurred when the
police attacked the students,'' the diplomat said.
   Diplomats reported no sign of any special police or military
state of alert in Tirana today.
   ``Here on our street, where there are several embassies, we are
holding normal consular hours with people coming to see us,'' one
diplomat said. ``The usual guards have not been increased.''
   The diplomats all spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The fact that the incident was reported by the official news
agency was in line with recent moves to slowly open Albania to the
outside world and ease controls on the country's 3.2 million
citizens.
   Albanian leaders have, however, rejected multiparty democracy of
the kind that has replaced orthodox Marxist rule in other East
European countries.
   In preparation for elections next year, the Communist-controlled
Parliament last month approved a law that would allow independent
candidates to run in secret-ballot elections. However, the law
guarantees that only candidates who are not overt anti-Communists
can run.
   Strict control of the economy is being loosened and limited, and
some private enterprise is now encouraged. The government also has
eased regulations that had prevented all but a few Albanians from
going abroad.

<HEAD>Havel Asks For Broader, Temporary Powers to Save Country</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel asked
Parliament today for broader, temporary powers to keep the country
from breaking apart.
   In an emergency speech, he said Czechoslovakia's future is being
threatened by a dispute over a division of powers between the
federal government, the Czech republic and the Slovak republic,
where nationalism has risen rapidly.
   ``I am very sorry I had to go this far,'' the
playwright-turned-president said in the nationally televised
speech. ``I am doing this to fulfill the expectations of millions
of citizens who ... entrusted this position to me and believe I
will help save our federation.''
   ``Our state is not this time threatened from the outside, as so
many times in the past, but from the inside,'' he said. ``We are
threatening it ourselves with ou low political culture, lack of
democratic consciousness and mututal understanding ... our lack of
experience and personal bad qualities.''
   Havel did not immediately say what powers he wants. He said they
would be included in a bill to be presented soon to Parliament, and
he urged that it be considered immediately.
   He said the powers would be in effect until a new constitution
is adopted, sometime within the next 18 months.
   Havel also proposed that Parliament immediately set up a
constitutional court and pass a law permitting national referenda
as last resorts to settle political disputes.
   Under Czechoslovakia's current constitution, Havel is empowered
to sign treaties, command the armed forces, appoint the federal
government, summon and dissolve parliament, sign its laws, grant
amnesties or other legal pardons and declare war.
   He is also allowed to assume extra powers granted by special
law.
   Havel has been content for much of his nearly one year as
president to be a moral force in politics. But his tough speech
today before Parliament indicated that separatist threats from the
Slovak republic had forced him to act.
   He singled out the premier of the Slovak republic, Vladimir
Meciar, for criticism.
   Slovak leaders have been quoted as saying that if the federal
parliament insists on amending a draft agreement dividing powers
among the federal government and the republics, they will declare
the sovereignty of Slovak law on their territory.
   Parliament plans Tuesday to debate a law dividing powers among
the federal government and the two republics.
   The Czech and Slovak parliaments differ over control of oil and
gas pipelines, taxation and budget questions, postal services,
control over policy toward ethnic minorities, and chairmanship of
the national bank.
   Havel said a declaration of Slovak sovereignty was clearly
unconstitutional, and said that whatever decision Parliament makes
is legally binding ``on all institutions and all people.''
   Otherwise, ``the thin ice of our constitution will be broken and
our state would inevitably fall into legal chaos,'' he said.
   He warned that if Czechoslovakia, formed from two parts of the
former Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, broke in two, neither part
could guarantee the inviolability of its borders, and chances for
economic reform would end.
   Western leaders repeatedly have warned Czechoslovakia that its
internal instability is one of the greatest threats to aid and
investment.
   Czechoslovakia needs large amounts of both to throw off the
vestiges of four decades of communism. Government economic policy
calls for rapid privatization of the state-run economy, beginning
next year.

   The former Communists and their
hard-line President Slobodan Milosevic led in early election
returns today in Serbia. Opposition leaders accused them of
widespread vote-rigging.
   First official results from just five of the republic's 250
voting districts showed Milosevic with more than 66 percent of the
overall vote for president. His main challenger, populist Vuk
Draskovic, had about 19 percent.
   Socialists also led the opposition for parliament in the five
districts, said Caslav Ignjatovic, chairman of the republic's
electoral commission. He estimated turnout at 80 percent.
   Officials of the opposition Democratic Party said no firm
results were known in Sunday's elections, Serbia's first free
multiparty elections since 1938. But they reported indications from
around Yugoslavia's largest republic gave an expected lead to
Milosevic and his Socialists, the renamed Communists.
   The state news agency Tanjug said the Socialists had won nearly
80 of Parliament's 250 seats, according to its unofficial survey of
140 districts.
   A victory for Milosevic and his party is thought likely to
deepen Yugoslavia's regional strife, which threatens to break the
country apart.
   A runoff vote will be held Dec. 23 for the presidency or any of
the 250 Serbian Parliament seats in which no single candidate wins
50 percent.
   Republic-wide elections were also held Sunday in Montenegro,
where Communists took an early lead, according to unofficial
returns reported by the official news agency Tanjug.
   Tanjug said the Communist candidate for Montenegro's presidency,
Momir Bulatovic, appeared likely to win without having to face a
runoff.
   The Marxist leaders of Serbia and Montenegro are pitted against
the Western-leaning republics of Slovenia and Croatia in the
Yugoslav power struggle.
   At stake is whether the volatile Balkan country stays together
as a federal republic, dissolves into a confederacy or collapses
with member states becoming completely independent.
   Center-right coalitions ousted the Communists in Slovenia and
Croatia in regional elections earlier this year, and advocate
greater democracy and implementation of market-based economic
reform on the federal level.
   Milosevic, the charismatic Soclialist leader of Serbia, has
refused to acknowledge the possibility of a federal break-up or to
negotiate with the western republics.
   Draskovic, of the Serbian Renewal Movement, has said he would
negotiate with Croatia and Slovenia.
   The voting was marred by charges of ballot-rigging and
widespread irregularities at the Serbian republic's 9,500 polling
stations.
   Electoral Commission Chairman Caslav Ignjatovic said he was
investigating the claims.
   Draskovic said the Socialists distributed campaign leaflets at
polling stations Sunday and that pro-government media also ignored
a ban on campaigning that was to have extended two days before the
election.
   Opposition leaders also claimed the Socialists stopped
registering deaths in Serbia in April in a plan to rig the election
using phantom votes.
   ``Communists ... are capable of doing anything to stay in
power,'' Draskovic said.
   Both Draskovic and Milosevic stressed their support for tight
Serbian control over the formerly autonomous province of Kosovo, in
the southern area of Serbia.
   The ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo boycotted Sunday's
elections to protest the Serbian government's decision over the
summer to strip them of self-rule and close Albanian newspapers.
   The divisions among Serbians, Croats and Slovenes, as well as
the Kosovo-Serbia conflict, reflect the Babel of ethnic and
political forces vying for power in Yugoslavia. The Central
Intelligence Agency predicted recently that the country could be
torn apart within 18 months.

<HEAD>Tass Denies Rumors That Gorbachev Will Quit Party Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rumors that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
step down as Communist Party chief are ``totally unfounded,'' the
state-run news agency Tass said today.
   Gorbachev opened a plenary session of the party's Central
Committee in the Kremlin, convened to discuss the party's position
on a draft Union Treaty and tasks of party organizations, Tass
said.
   ``Although the Communist Party has become an opposition party in
many republics after the last elections, it remains the only truly
national political force,'' Tass said.
   ``This gives Gorbachev a chance to preserve the union and at the
same time to give new meaning to `sovereignty of union
republics,''' the news agency said. ``Therefore, rumors that
Gorbachev may resign as party leader at this plenary meeting are
totally unfounded.''
   Tass did not say where the rumors came from.
   The rumors echoed previous speculation that Gorbachev would
eventually step down as party chief, continuing to wield power in
his strengthened job as president. Gorbachev has been attempting to
transfer to the government much of the Communist Party's once
all-powerful control over the country.
   Tass said the Central Committee would discuss the new Union
Treaty draft and preparations for the nation's fourth Congress of
People's Deputies, scheduled to open Dec. 17.
   According to the Tass report, the Central Committee might make
changes in the Politburo following changes in the party leadership
at the republican level in Byelorussia and Georgia.
   ``Despite a change in the balance of political forces in the
country, much depends on the result's of today's plenum,'' Tass
said.
   The Union Treaty under discussion by the Central Committee
defines the relationship between the Kremlin and the 15 Soviet
republics.
   The proposed treaty, Gorbachev's plan for saving the union from
collapse, has also been sent to the legislatures of the Soviet
Union and the republics for approval.
   However, six republics have already said they will not sign the
document, which would give them virtual control over all affairs
except defense.
   The draft treaty represents the central government's attempt to
preserve the union and appease secession movments by the republics
and smaller regions while creating a uniform, market-oriented
economic system.
   The Central Committee meeting was closed to the public and
reporters.

<HEAD>With PM-Nobel Prizes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a partial text of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's speech accepting the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize
on Monday. The English translation was supplied by the Nobel
Committee:
   ... The prize has been awarded since the beginning of this
century. The disasters and tragedies of this period, which have not
managed to subdue man's optimism and unflagging belief in human
reason, have given the Peace Prize the unique aura associated with
it today.
   Immanuel ant prophesied that mankind would one day be faced
with a dilemma: either to be joined in a true union of nations or
to perish in a war of annihilation ending in the extinction of the
human race. Now, as we move from the second to the third
millennium, the clock has struck the moment of truth.
   In this respect the year 1990 represents a turning point. It
marks the end of the unnatural division of Europe. Germany has been
reunited. We have begun resolutely to tear down the material
foundations of a military, political and ideological confrontation.
But there are some very grave threats that have not been
eliminated: the potential for conflict and the primitive instincts
that allow it, aggressive intentions and totalitarian traditions.
   I would like to assure you that the leadership of the U.S.S.R.
is doing and will continue to do everything in its power to ensure
that future developments in Europe and the world as a whole are
based on openness, mutual trust, international law and universal
values.
   The recent meeting in Paris of heads of state and government
from the European nations, the United States and Canada, embodying
all the best elements in international movements such as the
Helsinki Process, has established the framework for a Europe based
on the rule of law, stability, good relations between neighboring
countries and humane attitudes. It is my hope that such a Europe
will be understood and accepted by nations and governments in other
parts of the world as an example of universal security and genuine
cooperation. ...
   The Nobel Peace Prize for 1990 confirms that perestroika and
innovative political thinking no longer belong only to us, the
people of the Soviet Union. They are the property of the whole of
mankind and are an inseparable part of its destiny and of a safe
and peaceful future. We are deeply grateful to Norway and other
members of the international community who have shown such
understanding and who, through their conduct in international
issues and in their relations with the Soviet Union, have shown
their solidarity as we proceed with our perestroika and their
sympathy as we struggle to resolve our problems.
   If we all took this as our point of departure, mankind would
have no cause to regret the loss of a unique opportunity for reason
and the logic of peace to prevail over that of war and alienation.

   Hundreds of demonstrators opposed to the Roman
Catholic Church's stand on abortion and AIDS education protested
outside St. Patrick's Cathedral, but obeyed a court order not to
disrupt Mass.
   Sunday's rowdy but peaceful demonstration came a year after the
pandemonium in which 113 activists were arrested.
   On Dec. 10, 1989, about 4,500 protesters gathered to dispute the
church's teachings. Forty-three were arrested for chanting, lying
down and chaining themselves to pews during the service. Seventy
more were arrested outside.
   This time, four people were arrested - six blocks from the
cathedral - when the throng sat briefly in the street on Fifth
Avenue, blocking traffic.
   Some 25 members of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power and
Women's Health Action and Mobilization walked out of the cathedral
during Cardinal John O'Connor's homily, but services were not
disrupted, said police Sgt. Robert Ahearn.
   Outside the church, about 350 protesters marched in a
half-block-long circle for two hours, shrieking, blowing whistles,
pounding tambourines and drums, and chanting, ``Teach safe sex.
Just say no is not enough.''
   O'Connor said from the pulpit that he should be allowed to
exercise his right to disseminate church teachings. Afterward, he
asked worshipers to ``react with love'' to any demonstrators they
encountered outside, said spokesman Joe Zwilling.
   The Archdiocese of New York was prepared for the anniversary of
last year's disturbance. On Friday, it got a court order allowing
protesters to pray inside the church, but not to disrupt services.
   About 450 police officers were deployed, some wearing riot gear.
The church, which holds 2,800 people, was closed after the Mass
began.
   The two groups say O'Connor and the Catholic Church are
obstructing the dissemination of safe sex information and
advocating ``atred and violence'' against homosexuals and abortion
rights supporters.
   ``Lives are at stake,'' said a lawyer for the AIDS group,
William Dobbs. ``There are people who are sick today because of the
cardinal's policies.''
   The U.S. Catholic bishops have said the public distribution of
condoms could lead to promiscuous sexual behavior, and that
abstinence outside of marriage is the ``only morally correct and
medically sure way'' to prevent AIDS.
   Assistant Police Chief Thomas Walsh called the protest ``very
peaceful, very nice.''
   ``They have the right to do what they want, as long as they
behave like perfect ladies and gentlemen - and they did,'' said
worshiper Mary Hayhurst of Dracut, Mass.
   Six of last year's demonstrators were convicted last month of
criminal trespass, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and other
offenses. They will be sentenced in January.

<TEXT>
   John Alexander, a former Metropolitan Opera
tenor and professor of music at the University of Cincinnati, died
after a performance in his hometown of Meridian, Miss. He was 67.
   Alexander suffered a heart attack Saturday shortly after
finishing a performance of ``Nessum Dorma'' from ``Turandot.'' He
died later Saturday at Anderson Hospital in Meridian.
   He had been in Meridian, the city where he was born, for a gala
benefit for the restoration of the community's 100-year-old opera
house.
   ``Everyone here is amazed at the poetic-ness of his death,''
said his son-in-law, David Staples of Chicago. ``He was doing a
major performance for the first time in three years. He was with
his friends from the world of opera and was back in Mississippi,
which he loved and where he always wanted to be buried, in his
family's plot.''
   Alexander began his career in Cincinnati as a student at the old
Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. His debut was the lead in
``Faust'' at the Cincinnati Summer Opera at the Zoo in 1950.
   He had a long career at the New York City Opera and the
Metropolitan Opera, where he sang for 25 years. He was known for
his Moaart roles, including Belmonte in ``The Abduction from the
Seraglio'' and Ferrando in ``Cosi Fan Tutte.'' He was acclaimed at
both New York houses as Bacchus is Strauss's ``Ariadne auf Naxos.''
   Alexander had two heart bypass operations in the 1970s, but
continued to perform at the Metropolitan until 1987. He still
taught opera and voice at the conservatory, now part of the
University of Cincinnati, and gave occasional performances. He
lived with his wife, Sue, in suburban Cincinnati.
   ``He was always interested in young people,'' Mrs. Alexander
said. ``He was an unselfish, outgoing and loving person, and always
the tenor.''
   Italo Tajo, retired chairman of the conservatory's opera
department, said Alexander's death will be a loss to the music
world.
   ``He was a great asset to any theater because he was always
ready for anything,'' Tajo said.
   Alexander had sung leading roles in more than 50 operas. He was
on the board of trustees of the Cincinnati Opera Company.
   In addition to his wife, survivors include a daughter, Cindy
Staples of Chicago; a sister, Ann Quin of Jackson, Miss.; and two
grandchildren.
   Funeral services are scheduled Tuesday in Meridian.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to postpone a
Jan. 22 election under a redistricting plan designed to help elect
an Hispanic to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for the
first time in 115 years.
   The court rejected an emergency request by board members, who
said the plan ordered by a federal judge is unlawful.
   The justices, oowever, took no action on a formal appeal by
board members still pending before the high court.
   The five-member board, controlled by conservatives, was accused
by Hispanics in 1988 of violating their rights by drawing districts
after the 1980 census that allegedly diluted Hispanic voting
strength.
   The lawsuit against the board said the district lines violated
constitutional rights assuring equal protection for all and a 1982
federal voting rights law. The law forbids not only intentional
discrimination but also any practice that has the effect of
weakening the voting strength of minorities.
   U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon declared the former district
plan unconstitutional. He carved out a new district in which
Hispanics account for an estimated 51 percent of the registered
voters and 71 percent of the population.
   Kenyon ruled that when the board redrew districts after the 1980
census, members fragmented the Hispanic vote in an effort to help
their own re-election chances.
   The number of Hispanics living in what constitutes the district
created by Kenyon has increased dramatically in the last decade.
The board member now representing the new district is retiring.
   The county has a population of about 8.5 million people, and the
board of supervisors has considerable power over such matters as
planning and development.
   The Bush administration sided with Hispanic rights groups in
urging the Supreme Court not to disturb Kenyon's ruling, which was
upheld last month by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The cases are Los Angeles County vs. Garza, 90-849, A-422.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today asked the Bush
administration for its views on whether a Civil War era law enacted
primarily to protect freed slaves bans racially discriminatory
firings.
   The justices said they want to hear from Justice Department
lawyers about a ruling that the manufacturer of Buster Brown shoes
was guilty of illegal racial bias when it fired a white supervisor
at a Missouri warehouse.
   The court is not expected to say whether it will review the case
until hearing from the government lawyers, which could take months.
   Kenneth Hicks worked for the Brown Shoe Company for 34 years.
His assignment when fired in 1982 had been as evening shift foreman
at a warehouse in Benton, Mo.
   The company, in trimming its workforce, dismissed Hicks while
keeping another supervisor, Alvin Chester, who is black.
   Hicks said he was fired because of his race, even though he had
more seniority than Chester.
   Hicks testified that when he asked a boss at the warehouse if
race was behind the firing, the boss smirked and said, ``You said
that, not me.''
   Hicks also cited evidence that the company had an affirmative
action plan aimed at promoting more blacks to supervisory jobs.
   Company officials said they chose to retain Chester because he
had more experience and was better qualified for the specific job
both men were doing.
   A federal jury ordered the company to pay Hicks $10,000 in
punitive damages, and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
April awarded him nearly $21,000 more in attorney fees and other
legal costs.
   The appeals court said a civil rights law enacted in 1866
forbids racially discriminatory firings.
   The law was the focus of a highly publicized Supreme Court
ruling in 1989.
   The justices said the law does not ban on-the-job racial
harassment. But they upheld a 1976 ruling that the law does permit
lawsuits against private individuals or companies accused of bias
in the making and enforcing of contracts.
   Left unanswered was whether the law specifically applies to
racially biased firings.
   The 8th Circuit court said last year's high court ruling is
unclear, adding, ``We simply decline ... to overrule the clear and
undisputed precedent of this circuit.''
   The appeals court, with jurisdiction in seven Midwestern states,
said firing ``is fundamentally different from racial harassment or
discrimination in the terms or conditions of employment.
Discriminatory discharge goes to the very existence and nature of
the employment contract.''
   The states in the 8th Circuit are Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota.
   The case is Brown Group Inc. vs. Hicks, 90-324.

   Israeli soldiers enforced a rare curfew in
Bethlehem today, and the town's Palestinian mayor condemned a
bombing that killed an Israeli soldier and wounded two others the
day before.
   Elsewhere in the occupied lands, scattered clashes broke out
today between soldiers and stone-throwing youths and at least 12
Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire, including a 14-year-old
boy who was shot in the head, Arab reports said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   Two weeks before Christmas, the West Bank town of Bethlehem, the
site of Christ's birth, looked like a virtual ghost town as
soldiers manned roadblocks, closed stores and ordered all
Palestinians indoors, Arab reports said.
   In the port city of Haifa, comrades and relatives buried
paratrooper Guy Friedman, 19, the soldier killed in Sunday's
pipe-bomb explosion on the Jerusalem-Bethlehem highway. No one
claimed responsibility for the attack.
   In Bethlehem, photographers said about half a dozen tourist
buses, incluing one with a group from Denver, arrived under
military escort and visited the Church of Nativity, built at the
spot where tradition says Christ was born.
   The army imposed the curfew in Bethlehem Sunday. Arab reporters
said the curfew was the first in Bethlehem since Nov. 15, 1988,
when there was an army clampdown in all the occupied lands to
prevent celebrations and demonstrations when the Palestine
Liberation Organization in Algiers declared national independence.
   Most refugee camps in the West Bank remained under curfew today,
but the army lifted curfews elsewhere in the occupied territories.
The curfews were imposed Thursday to prevent violence over the
weekend, marking the third anniversary of the uprising against
Israeli occupation of lands seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij condemned Sunday's violence.
   ``What is depressing and increasing tension is the absence of
any prospect of peaceful dialogue,'' he said.
   After the bombing, angry residents of the Jewish settlement of
Beit Haggai in the West Bank blocked a main road calling for
harsher army action against Palestinian activists, army radio said.
   Settler leader Aharon Dom said the bombing should prompt the
government to deport Palestinian leaders.
   ``The Arabs must know that every additional cycle of terror will
bring them to being uprooted from this land. And this uprooting
means that there will be no return,'' Dom told army radio.
   Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron visited the site of the
bombing and said it did not constitute a shift to a more violent
phase of the Palestinian uprising.
   ``But if we are also looking at the background of radicalization
here in the field, in the context of what is happening in the world
- including the (Persian) Gulf - we cannot but take into
consideration the possibility of a change,'' he told Israel radio.

   Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan has
pledged to form a new government that excludes a minister blamed
for the rift between his administration and the army, news reports
said today.
   Chatichai was renamed prime minister Sunday, less than 24 hours
after resigning in an apparent maneuver to revamp his Cabinet,
which had been strongly criticized by the military.
   The military had insisted he dismiss several democratically
installed Cabinet members and it made unspecified threats.
Chatichai resigned knowing his reinstatement was likely and would
let him refashion the Cabinet.
   Government spokesman Suvit Yodmani said Chatichai was discussing
the new Cabinet with members of his coalition and it might be two
days before it is announced.
   The Nation newspaper quoted Chatichai as saying his new
government would not include Deputy Minister of Education Chalerm
Yumbamrung, who has clashed with military chiefs several times this
year.
   ``There is nothing to worry about. The military will be
satisfied with the new government,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Chatichai last reshuffled his Cabinet in November and broke a
promise he had made to the military to drop Chalerm then. Chalerm
was demoted to the education ministry slot but remained in the
Cabinet.
   The military has in recent years voiced support for Thailand's
fledgling democracy after decades of intervention. But it has tried
to maintain a position as watchdog over state and society and its
leaders have frequently made political pronouncements.

   An international group that includes St.
Louis-based Southwestern Bell has won a controlling interest in
Mexico's telephone monopoly, one of the largest concerns being sold
in a privatization drive.
   The Finance Ministry on Sunday announced the winning $1.76
billion bid of the consortium, which is led by Mexico's Grupo Carso
and also includes France Cable &amp; Radio.
   The group will get 20.4 percent of the company, which is trying
to modernize and expand an aging system that now serves 4.1 million
customers in this rapidly growing country of some 84 million
people.
   The government holds more than $4 billion worth of shares in
Telmex, which is valued at roughly $8 billion. It plans to sell the
remainder of its shares, most of them non-voting issues, on
national and international stock markets.
   In separate agreements signed earlier Sunday, the government
agreed to finance sale of 4.4 percent of the company to its workers
over an eight-year period.
   By the end of this year, Mexico will have sold all but 25 of the
404 state companies it owned in 1982, the government-owned Notimex
news agency reported Sunday.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took office in late
1988, has pushed privatization ss a way to help draw foreign and
expatriate local capital into the country to fuel modernization of
industry.
   Grupo Carso is the lead partner under government insistence that
the company remain under Mexican control. The stipulation meant to
mollify nationalists with bitter memories of foreign exploitation
in the past.
   Grupo Carso is led by Carlos Slim, an adviser to the president.
   The company owns store chains such as Aurrera and Superama, Vips
restaurants and the famed Sanborns restaurant-luxury store chain,
as well as interests in paper companies, hotels and a stock
brokerage.
   Southwestern Bell, one of the regional companies spun off from
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph in 1984, has sales of more than $8.9
billion a year.
   The French partner is a unit of France Telecom, with sales of
more than $20 billion yearly.
   Finance ministry officials said the sale was meant to
``radically improve'' phone service, expand the system, strengthen
research and development efforts, guarantee the rights of the
workers and to guarantee majority Mexican control.
   Telmex had already launched a three-year modernization program
to help make it more attractive to buyers.
   In September, the company signed $300 million worth of contracts
with a group led by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph for a new
optic-fiber cable network and terminals.

   Saddam Hussein's release of foreign hostages
in Iraq and Kuwait should not raise hopes for a peaceful resolution
of the Persian Gulf crisis, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said
today.
   Cheney said the release of hostages was ``obviously very good
news'' for the hostages and their families, but it did not mean
Iraq is backing away from its armed occupation of Kuwait.
   ``The illegal, immoral, illicit act of Saddam Hussein in holding
hundreds of American hostages against their will for several months
appears to be coming to an end,'' Cheney said in remarks to a
defense industry group.
   ``But I don't believe Saddam Hussein deserves any credit for
stopping a practice that obviously is abhorrent to the civilized
world. He has to rank as one of the world's all-time
hostage-takers,'' Cheney said.
   Iraq has continued to send reinforcements to Kuwait and southern
Iraq, Cheney said.
   ``In these past few days as he has released hostages he has
simultaneously continued to build up his deployments in Kuwait, to
enhance his fortifications and to add additional forces to the
regions,'' Cheney said. ``He has given us absolutely no indication
whatsoever of any intention'' of complying with U.N. resolutions
requiring the Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and the restoration of
the Kuwaiti monarchy by Jan. 15.
   Cheney's remarks appeared aimed at counteracting any positive
public reaction in the United States to the arrival home of
hostages held in Iraq and Kuwait since the Aug. 2 invasion.
   Cheney's comments followed those of other top-level Bush
administration officials who said the United States wants
international controls over Iraq's nuclear weapons and other
sophisticated arms once the current crisis is resolved.
   In spelling out the administration's reasons for committing a
quarter of a million American troops to the gulf and threatening to
use them against Iraq, Cheney particularly stressed the economic
interests at stake.
   ``There is no naysaying the fact that one of the major concerns
we have is the very real possibility that should Saddam Hussein
succeed in his aggression, should he be allowed to keep Kuwait,
that he would be in a position to directly control over 20 percent
of the world's proven oil reserve,'' Cheney said.
   The defense secretary also said a longstanding U.S. commitment
to preserving the independence of Saudi Arabia and other gulf
states is ``at the heart of this.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft spelled out the American vision of the
Persian Gulf's military future Sunday.
   Baker said Kuwait's bargaining position would be aided by
``security arrangements'' aimed at bridling Iraq's superior
military might and its ``weapons of mass destruction.''
   ``That's not something we get to until after he withdraws,''
Baker said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''.
   Scowcroft, on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said, ``What we would
want to see is his weapons of mass destruction programs or his
nuclear, biological and chemical programs under strict
international supervision, so that he cannot develop that kind of
capability.''
   They also demanded that Baker's anticipated meeting with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein be held by Jan. 3.
   The Iraqi leader has offered to meet Baker in Baghdad on Jan. 12
- three days before a United Nations deadline for Iraq to withdraw
from Kuwait or face eviction by military force.
   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Abdul Amir Al-Anbari, would not rule out
a Saddam-Baker session by Jan. 3. But he said that if fighting
erupts, American losses in one day could surpass total U.S.
casualties during the Vietnam war, when more than 55,000 Americans
died.
   ``That means any war would make really that region of the world
simply hell, and perhaps also the rest of the globe into a ...
crisis which I don't know whether we will recover from it or not,''
Al-Anbari said on the NBC program.
   Baker said that when he meets with Saddam, he will not agree to
an Iraqi withdrawal in exchange for giving Iraq a small,
oil-producing region of Kuwait because ``to say anything else would
be to reward an aggressor.''
   But Baker said that if Iraq withdraws completely from Kuwait,
the two neighbors could negotiate to settle remaining differences.
Iraq is demanding a sea lane to the Persian Gulf and has accused
Kuwait of plundering an oil field the two nations share along their
common border.
   Al-Anbari said his country might accept a security arrangement
that covered the entire Persian Gulf region.
   ``But if it is just against Iraq, singling out Iraq, it is just
simply not acceptable,'' he said.

   President Bush has written a letter to Lech
Walesa to congratulate him on his election as president of Poland,
the White House said today.
   ``The president noted that this electoral process was an
important afirmation of the strengthening of democracy and freedom
in Poland,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said Bush wrote the congratulatory letter on Sunday
night.
   ``He congratulated Mr. Walesa on his leadership and courage,
which has been displayed over many years. The president assured him
that the United States stands by Poland and we'll do all we can to
support this new democracy,'' Fitzwater said.
   The Solidarity leader was elected by a landslide in Poland's

   A man who doused himself with fuel and
then set himself ablaze left fliers describing his suicide as a
protest of U.S. policies in the Persian Gulf, authorities said.
   Timothy T. Brown, 48, a knife-sharpener who served his customers
from his van, burned to death Sunday morning on the steps of a
deserted cannery in this rural Delta community about 40 miles
southeast of Sacramento.
   Investigators said Brown apparently splashed the liquid on
himself, then stood or knelt over a pail filled with the fuel as he
ignited it. His van, parked about 100 yards away, had a stack of
one-page letters on the side window next to a sign that said,
``Take One.''
   ``I, Tim Brown, Vietnam veteran, declare that my act of
self-immolation is a direct protest of American war policy in the
Middle East. America do not go to war. ... America, do not repeat
the mistake of Vietnam.''
   Brown also left copies of the letter on the windshields of
neighbors' cars.
   Bob Brian, an investigator with the Sacramento County coroner's
office, said Brown's fiery death ignited a blaze at the cannery
that firefighters extinguished. Brian's office confirmed that
Brown's death was a suicide.
   Brown was a familiar figure in the rustic Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta, a lush network of levees, rivers and sloughs and small towns
about 50 miles east of San Francisco. His knife-sharpening business
served restaurants and other customers on a regular route between
San Francisco and the Delta.
   He lived on a houseboat, neighbors said, and had recently
completed installing new plumbing, carpeting and a water heater.
   ``He just seemed like a regular kind of guy,'' said Jim Willis,
owner of a liquor store patronized by Brown.

<TEXT>
   Elected by a landslide in Poland's first
popular presidential vote, Lech Walesa got right to work today on
his pledge to build this young democracy into an economically sound
``pillar of peace.''
   Walesa, who led the decade-long struggle that ended
authoritarian Communist rule, acknowledged that ``terribly
difficult tasks'' lie ahead as he attempts to complete the painful
transition to a market-based economy.
   ``I want to work because there is a lot of work to be done,''
the former shipyard electrician told reporters at his Gdansk
headquarters after defeating emigre businessman Stanislaw Tyminski
in Sunday's runoff.
   Prosecutors today ordered that Tyminski be barred from leaving
Poland while an investigation continues into allegations he
slandered the government during his campaign, state television
reported.
   Tyminski was ordered last week to appear this month for
questioning before a prosecutor in southern Poland. The general
prosecutor in Warsaw said steps must be taken to assure he will
answer the summons, the television report said.
   A slander case was opened against Tyminski, who has Canadian and
Peruvian as well as Polish citizenships, after he said last month
that Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki betrayed the nation by
causing hardship and chaos with his economic reforms. He accused
the prime minister of economic ``treason.''
   Meanwhile, Parliament Speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz said today
that Walesa's swearing-in before the National Assembly will take
place about Dec. 21. The date depends on when the Supreme Court
completes its review of the election.
   The president-elect went to work today in a new government car
with three police vehicles in escort. Later, he made a sentimental
pilgrimage to the former Lenin shipyard, his former workplace and
birthplace of Solidarity.
   Walesa told workers he wouldn't forget that he once wore
overalls.
   ``I am going to return here often,'' he said.
   The Solidarity chief's margin of victory was 74 percent to 25
percent for Tyminski, according to full unofficial results released
today by the national election commission. It said Walesa received
10.6 million votes to 3.7 million votes for his opponent.
   Two bitter and divisive rounds of voting strained the nation,
splintering the Solidarity movement a year after Poland ousted the
Communists and embarked on the most ambitious economic reform plan
in Eastern Europe.
   Walesa said he would decide by Wednesday which of seven possible
candidates to select to succeed Mazowiecki. The former Walesa ally
was eliminated by Tyminski in the Nov. 25 first round of
presidential voting.
   In a taped address to the nation Sunday night, Walesa repeated
his campaign theme of speeding up the dismantling of
Communist-collectived industries and encouraging private
enterprise.
   ``In Poland there is enough work for everyone. We must change
and modernize much,'' he said. ``Europe will appreciate us for
this. An economically developed Poland will be one of the pillars
of peace and calm in Europe, whereas a poor Poland will meet a wall
of disapproval at all borders.''
   ``I hope to be a good sheriff - determined, strong and
effective,'' Walesa told a news conference earlier. Some Mazowiecki
supporters have accused the vocational school graduate of
demagoguery and promising more than he could possibly deliver.
   Walesa sipped champagne for the TV cameras and gave an awkward
but affectionate kiss to his wife Danuta at the insistence of
photographers.
   Newspaper editor Adam Michnik, a Mazowiecki ally who has
bitterly accused Walesa of demagogic tendencies, promised ``loyal''
opposition.
   Writing today in his paper, Gazeta Wyborcza, Michnik described
Walesa as an ``outstanding politician'' who had to decide which
course he would pursue as president: ``The rhetoric of promises,
the principles of courtly rule, the philosophy of decrees and the
`ax,' or realism, responsibility, respect for pluralism and the
philosophy of the state of law?''
   Turnout in Sunday's vote was about 53 percent, compared to about
60 percent in the first round.
   Tyminski's best showing was among rural voters - where he
obtained about 35 percent. The challenger who returned to Poland in
September after 21 years in Peru and Canada had promised prosperity
in a month, finding support in people frustrated by economic
hardship and rising unemployment.
   ``There are many people in Poland for whom it is really bad,''
Walesa said. ``We must ... make Poland such that those doubters
quickly join us, because we need them.''
   Tyminski declined to concede defeat immediately, saying voters
had been intimidated by Walesa's camp. Journalists noticed no signs
of irregularities.
   The feud between Walesa and Mazowiecki split the Solidarity
movement, but after the first round of voting Walesa won the
backing of the Roman Catholic Church and virtually all political
and social organizations.
   For Walesa, 47, the presidency culminates an astonishing
personal voyage: from the middle child of a dirt-poor peasant
family to Belweder Palace, seat of Polish presidents.
   His union offices are just steps from the shipyard where Walesa
leaped into history as the charismatic leader of nationwide strikes
that shook the Communist firmament in August 1980.
   Outgoing President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the general and former
Communist leader who interned Walesa under martial law nine years
ago this month, was among the first to send congratulations.
   On Tuesday, Walesa is to travel - like Polish kings before him -
to the Jasna Gora monastery in Czestochowa to pledge fealty to the
nation in front of the painting of the Black Madonna, Poland's most
revered icon.

<HEAD>Ballets Russes Art Director Dead At 86</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boris Kochno, artistic director to Sergei Diaghilev
and his ``Ballets Russes,'' died at a Paris hospital during the
weekend, friends said today. He was 86.
   There was no information immediately available on the cause of
death. His death also was announced by Radio France.
   A choreographer, librettist and lighting specialist, Kochno was
artistic director to Diaghilev from 1922-29 and was responsible for
bringing Igor Stravinsky to the world of ballet.
   Born in Moscow in 1904, Kochno was best known for ballets danced
by Diaghilev's famed ``Ballets Russes'' troupe, including ``Les
Facheux,'' ``Zephire et Flore'' and ``Les Matelots.''
   After Diaghilev's death in 1929, Kochno took over the company
and moved it to Monte Carlo where in 1933 he founded, along with
George Balanchine, another troupe, Les Ballets. But it was
short-lived.
   After World War II, he created the Ballets des Champs-Elysees
and wrote many librettos including ``Les Forains,'' (1945)
choreographed by Roland Petit.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Prison-Suit Issue in Connecticut Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed today to decide
whether prison inmates sometimes are entitled to jury trials when
suing prison officials over alleged mistreatment.
   The justices said it will hear an appeal by John J. McCarthy,
who accused officials at a state prison in Somers, Conn., of
violating his rights when they removed him from his cell in 1983.
   He said officials used excessive force in using tear gas to get
him out of his cell. He also alleged that they planted a knife in
his cell as a pretext for removing him.
   McCarthy initially agreed to have a federal magistrate decide
his case but later changed his mind.
   U.S. District Judge Jose A. Cabranes ruled that McCarthy had
given up his right to a jury trial and assigned the case to
Magistrate F. Owen Eagan.
   The magistrate, after conducting eight days of hearings at the
prison in 1988, recommended that Cabranes rule in favor of the
prison officials, and the judge agreed.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's ruling.
The appeals court said Cabranes acted properly in rejecting
McCarthy's request to have a jury decide the case against the
officials.
   Federal law authorizes federal judges to assign to magistrates
cases in which prisoners say their rights are violated by
conditions of confinement. The judge can designate a magistrate
even if the officials and prisoners object.
   The Supreme Court said it will decide whether the same rule
applies when a prisoner alleges ``a specific episode of allegedly
unconstitutional conduct rather than continuing prison
conditions.''
   The case is McCarthy vs. Bronson, 90-5635.

   Some Americans told tales of
deprivation at the hands of the Iraqis, but Dave Lammel said Monday
he spent his time in Kuwait in a royal palace where he ate off
Limoges china and drank from crystal glasses.
   ``I had the irony of living in these ungodly opulent
conditions,'' he said. ``It was bizarre. It was like a Fellini
movie.''
   But the 42-year-old from Orinda, Calif., was no less a hostage
of Saddam Hussein than Terrence Dupuis, 53, who had to stomach
rotten food and a hole in the ground for a toilet.
   Both recounted their days in captivity after a night enjoying
what was for Dupuis the luxury of a comfortable bed at a hotel in
Frankfurt, where they arrived after midnight Sunday on a flight
from Baghdad.
   On Monday morning, more than 150 hostages and family members,
most of them American, had a breakfast feast of real scrambled
eggs, bacon, hash browns, orange juice and coffee.
   Lammel, an engineering consultant for Chevron Corp. who arrived
in Kuwait July 10 on a business trip, was part of a group of
Westerners rounded up after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion.
   Instead of being taken to an arms depot to serve as human
shields, Lammel and the others were kept in a Kuwaiti royal family
palace inside a military compound just south of Kuwait City.
   Lammel, who lost 10 pounds in captivity, said he drank from
gold-rimmed crystal glasses and had a floor-to-ceiling marbled
bathroom at his disposal.
   But he expressed bitterness about being held hostage and about
the destruction of Kuwait. He also was upset about those soldiers
who already had died in Operation Desert Shield.
   ``I'd like to express my extreme sympathy to the families of
American soldiers who lost their lives. I feel their sacrifice has
been what brought me out alive,'' Lammel said. ``They died
protecting me.''
   Dupuis, a native of Massachusetts who was returning to his wife
in Toronto, spent his time as one of Saddam's ``human shields'' in
two military camps, the last one for 12 weeks.
   Aside from the food, the worst part was the lack of decent
toilet facilities, he said.
   Tom Kreuzman, gaunt and tired from his four months of hiding in
Kuwait, quietly recalled his passage to freedom Monday. But he
could not share the euphoria of the other 155 people who flew to
the United States from Frankfurt later in the day.
   Kreuzman, a 38-year-old native of Holiday, Fla., spent 23 days
alone in a ceiling duct with his Scottish terrier, Chu Chu, who got
lost in the rush at Baghdad airport on Sunday.
   ``It's a tragedy,'' said the former U.S. Air Force serviceman
who worked for the Kuwaiti Defense Ministry as a technician on
their Hawk missile system. ``She made it that far. She went through
a lot with me over there.''
   Kreuzman also said he felt guilty and hadn't wanted to leave
behind the Kuwaitis who had helped him hide from Iraqi authorities.
   He said they feared the world would forget about them once all
the hostages were out. Kreuzman pledged to return to Saudi Arabia
as soon as possible to help Kuwaiti soldiers there ``behind the
line.''
   ``They didn't invade Kuwait, they raped it,'' he said of the
occupying Iraqi forces.
   Despite dprivation, fear and the constant threat of war, Bruce
McKinnon was another animal lover who had turned down an earlier
opportunity to flee Kuwait because the flight couldn't accommodate
his two small dogs.
   ``One is 15 years old. And I promised him I would get him out of
Kuwait,'' said McKinnon, 44, a native of Frankfort, Mich.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teddy Kollek's pet word for the day was
``silly'' - mild by the standards of the blunt-talking Jerusalem
mayor.
   A Cabinet minister making his home in the Moslem Quarter:
``silly.'' A pledge by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to build yet
another Jewish housing project in Arab east Jerusalem: ``silly.''
   His own decision to run for mayor 25 years ago: ``the
silliest.''
   Teddy Kollek will be 80 in May, and is showing no inclination
toward imminent retirement.
   Up at dawn, at work until near midnight, he gives new meaning to
the word ``indefatigable.'' His bustling frame and thick hair
haven't changed in years. He is one of the world's best-known
mayors, with an office full of teddy bears sent by admirers.
   The Oct. 8 blood bath on the Temple Mount has plunged Jerusalem
into its worst crisis in 23 years, but it hasn't dimmed Kollek's
enthusiasm for the city.
   After the killing of at least 17 Palestinians by police
confronting a stone-throwing mob, Kollek sounded angry and
self-critical.
   In an interview with the Maariv newspaper, he railed at the
government for failing to treat the Arabs as equals, and at himself
for not doing enough for them.
   ``For the Jews, I did something. But for the (Arab) east?
Nothing. Enough blah-blah! What have I done? Schools? Nothing.
Sidewalks? Nothing. Cultural centers? Nothing,'' he stormed.
   But later, in an interview at his City Hall office, he seemed
calmer.
   ``I think it will take a long time until it gets back to where
it was,'' he said. ``It was a very traumatic event.''
   But he saw signs that the dust was settling.
   Arabs who boycotted the municipality immediately after the
shootings were trickling back looking for help with their problems,
he said. He pointed to small gestures - Arabs who spotted a bomb
and called the police; Arabs who rescued a Jewish family from a
mob. He wants to give them medals for public service, but the
Arabs, he says, fear the publicity.
   The Palestinian vengeance attacks that followed the Temple Mount
killings began with three Jews knifed to death in Jerusalem.
Although the stabbings spread around the country, it was
Jerusalem's image that took the worst beating. Tourists, both
foreign and Israeli, have stayed away in droves.
   Shlomo Lahat, mayor of Tel Aviv, came here with 1,400
schoolchildren the other day as part of ``Jerusalem - especially
now,'' a campaign to demonstrate solidarity with the city. ``I am a
Jerusalemite,'' declared Lahat, borrowing from the late John F.
Kennedy's celebrated phrase ``Ich bin ein Berliner.''
   ``I'm very moved, even though that usually doesn't happen to
me,'' Kollek replied. ``People are afraid of coming to Jerusalem
these days. ... It's no secret.''
   In an Israel increasingly drawn to mystic nationalism, Kollek
remains a convinced pragmatist, a throwback to the ``deeds, not
words'' philosophy of his mentor, David Ben-Gurion.
   The realist in Kollek tells him that managing a city of Jews and
Arabs in the cockpit of the Mideast conflict requires a hard head
and a feel for compromise. Hence he has little patience for
rhetoric.
   ``You have to work with tweezers,'' he says. ``You can't do
anything with grand declarations. ... I can do lots of little
things that together amount to something. I think this is the only
way.''
   He blames many of Jerusalem's problems on ``heavy-handed
government'' and an Israeli tendency ``to approach every problem
with an open mouth.'' But he faults the foreign media for treating
Jerusalem as though it was the only city in the world with communal
strife.
   ``I was terribly encouraged by a silly affair - by the fight
between Montreal and the Mohawks about a golf course,'' he
remarked. ``It's ridiculous, right?''
   Kollek lists various concessions made by Israel after it
captured Jerusalem from the attacking Jordanian army in 1967: a
semi-free Arabic press, a choice of Israeli or Jordanian
citizenship, Arab curricula in schools and Moslem control of access
to their holy places.
   The trouble, he says, is that these are now taken for granted.
   Another problem may be that not all Israelis are blessed - or
cursed - with Kollek's ability to see both sides of the problem.
   ``We can't put ourselves into the shoes of other people,'' he
said. ``Either we are unable to or we don't want to.''

   Some of the mule deer and antelope in
Utah's desert are surviving thanks to space technology.
   Hercules Corp. has donated more than 100 surplus casings for
solid fuel rockets to the state Division of Wildlife Resources
since 1978 for a program aimed at supplying water to animals in
otherwise inhospitable areas.
   The casings serve as tanks, nick-named ``guzzlers,'' to capture
and store rain water in areas that receive only 6 to 8 inches of
precipitation a year. They attract wildlife to areas that otherwise
might be avoided, said Jay Roberson, upland game program
coordinator for the division.
   ``They've opened up millions of acres,'' he said.
   The rocket casings are buried on public land, beneath a funnel
or catch basin that captures rain. A pipe or hose feeds the stored
water to a trough through a valve that opens when animals drink.
   The state still has to pay for other materials and install the
guzzlers, but officials say the tanks generally are the most costly
part. The price can exceed $10,000.
   ``The state has saved over $400,000 by using the cases instead
of buying new materials,'' said biologist Dean Mitchell.
   In the past, Hercules had to cut up surplus rocket motor casings
and send them to a landfill, said company engineer Richard Cloward,
who also is vice president of the Utah Wildlife Leadership
Coalition.
   ``It's crazy to spend money to cut those things up just to
facilitate burying them,'' he said.
   John Waugman, environmental engineer at Hercules, said the huge
casings generally are made of fiberglass, graphite or Kevlar, a
material used in bulletproof vests. They're usually stronger than
steel.
   ``It doesn't deteriorate,'' Cloward said.
   ``It will be there long after you and I are gone,'' added
Waugman.
   Hercules produces rocket motors for the Defense Department and
the space program, including the Titan and Titan IV, Delta II,
Trident II, the Midgetman small intercontinental ballistic missile
and Pegasus.
   Waugman said the donated casings were never filled with rocket
fuel. He and Cloward also said Hercules has run tests to ensure
that nothing from the tanks gets into the water or leaches into the
ground.
   Roberson is unable to document whether the tanks have been
responsible for increased populations of animals, but his general
impression is that the range has more animals because there is more
water.
   ``That's our belief and that's our observation,'' he said. ``We
believe it enough that we are willing to continue maintaining the
guzzlers.''
   ``There are the skeptics who say `show me the data,''' Roberson
said. ``But when we say how much money it would take to do the
study ... you could put in a lot of water to research that.''

   The only thing white about
Christmas here is the desert sand.
   Families and loved ones are far away for the American military
personnel deployed in Operation Desert Shield.
   Outward Christmas displays are barred so as not to offend the
Islamic sensibilities of the Saudi Arabians.
   Twinkling lights don't go with military tents.
   It's enough to give the toughest troops the Christmas blues. But
a psychologist says Desert Shield won't be completely barren of
holiday cheer.
   ``There will be kind of a blue haze over everything. It's kind
of a funk,'' said Capt. Frank Mullins, 54, of Mobile, Ala., a
psychologist at the U.S. Navy's Fleet No. 5 Hospital.
   ``But the average person will find a lot of solace being among
friends, sharing Christmas dinne, singing a couple of carols,'' he
said.
   What helps people get through the holidays are personal things
sent from home: a card, a trinket, a snapshot, Christmas music,
yule decorations, Mullins said.
   Army Maj. Doug Bidle of Chicago received a candy cane house
complete with fake snow and an artificial tree from his wife.
   Navy Petty Officer Diane Escobar of Austin, Texas, has a
nativity scene, and a paratrooper in the Army's 82nd Airborne
Division was mailed the artificial tree his father had in Vietnam.
   ``The troops here should try to have as normal a Christmas as
they can, with as many customs and rituals as they can get from
home,'' Mullins said.
   ``People are upset, don't get me wrong. If you don't feel upset,
maybe there's something wrong with you,'' he said. ``They may get
depressed. They may cry a little bit. But they'll be fine the next
day.
   ``We don't expect to be overflowing with psychiatric casualties
on Christmas Day.''
   What's also absent in Saudi Arabia is spiked eggnog and
alcoholic spirits because liquor is banned in Saudi Arabia.
   But Mullins said the absence of booze, a depressant, is one of
the reasons why the mood of the troops has been so good despite the
desert life, scorpions, vipers, isolation and harsh living
conditions.
   ``I'll be the first to say I'm glad there's no alcohol,'' he
said. ``What it does is cut down on the mental health business.
We've had surprisingly little business.''
   ``The truth of the matter is the mental health of many of troops
is going to improve,'' Mullins said. ``They can cope with normal
developmental pressures without alcohol.
   ``They're going to find they can engage in more adult behavior
and operate in their environment more realistically.''
   Most of the problems troops have sought help for are personal
ones: the Dear John letters, the death of a loved one back home,
the first child born while a serviceman is on desert duty.
   The military recognizes that stress, fatigue and anxiety can be
daily enemies than can dull the fighting edge of young service
members.
   ``The kids we're seeing are not bitching about living in the
sand,'' Mullins said. ``The harshness of the living conditions
since we've been here has not been that big a problem.
   ``How many times have you heard that morale is good when people
are bitching? When people get too depressed to bitch, you've got
problems. They withdraw socially, go into themselves.''
   What's important is the coping skills that people develop from
the hardships, the psychologist said.
   ``For a lot of young men here, this may be the major growth
experience in their lives,'' Mullins said. ``Don't forget, World
War II was that way for the people who're now 60 years old.''

   A top-level review of the nation's space
program recommended today that space shuttle flights be confined
only to those that require human involvement and that the proposed
space station be redesigned from top to bottom.
   A committee of experts said some of the concerns expressed about
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are ``deserved
and occasionally even self-inflicted.''
   Their report was released after Vice President Dan Quayle and
NASA administrator Richard Truly were briefed on its contents. The
12-member committee, which has been studying the space program for
four months, was headed by Norman R. Augustine, chairman and chief
executive officer of the Martin Marietta Corp.
   NASA has received heavy criticism this year, particularly after
shuttles were grounded for five months by leaks and by the
inability of the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope to see the
universe as sharply as advertised.
   The committee was asked whether some new form of management
structure was called for, but it said ``changes of such sweeping
scope are inappropriate.''
   ``In spite of imperfections, by far the greatest body of space
expertise in any single organization in the world resides within
NASA,'' the report said.
   ``Briefly stated, the committee believes that NASA, and only
NASA, realistically possesses the essential critical mass of
knowledge and expertise upon which the nation's civil space program
can be sustained.''
   The committee said NASA should start immediately to phase out
some of its missions on the space shuttle and transfer them to a
new, unmanned launch vehicle that would be developed.
   The report said the civil space program is overly dependent on
the shuttle for access to space and warned that statistically ``we
are likely to lose another space shuttle in the next several
years.''
   It said, therefore, that the shuttle should be used only for
those missions where human involvement is necessary.
   ``The committee believes in hindsight that it was, for example,
inappropriate in the case of Challenger to risk the lives of seven
astronauts and nearly one-fourth of NASA's launch assets to place
in orbit a communications satellite,'' the report said.
   Quayle called the report a tremendous effort and said the
committee will be reconvened in six months to assess what progress
has been made.
   Truly said ``NASA and I intend to take each of these
recommendations most seriously.''
   There was no immediate response from NASA. Most of the top
officials of the space agency met with the vice president.
   NASA and Quayle, who is head of the National Space Council, have
been at odds over the future of the program and the committee was
set up to respond to those concerns.
   The committee recommended that the priorities of the space
program be shifted to place primary emphasis on science. It also
recommended that the space station be redesigned to lessen
complexity and reduce cost - ``taking whatever time may be required
to do this thoroughly and innovatively.''
   The first construction flight for the station has been scheduled
for 1995, but Congress has balked at the cost of the station and
ordered NASA to cut back.
   The committee included former NASA administrator Thomas Paine,
former Air Force Secretary Edward C. (Pete) Aldridge Jr., and
former astronaut Joseph Allen. It offered to meet again in six
months, if NASA wants.

<HEAD>Former West German Spy Presumed Dead Turns Up Alive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A onetime spy for former West Germany who
disappeared into East Germany eight years ago and was declared dead
has surfaced alive and well, German authorities said Monday.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office in Karlsruhe, said officials were investigating whether the
agent had given up state secrets while working for West Germany's
intelligence service.
   The prosecutor's office did not identify the 48-year-old man by
name or say where he was staying. It was not clear whether he could
be prosecuted.
   He worked for the Office of the Defense of the Constitution, as
West Germany's secret service was called. The agency has the same
name in united Germany.
   The man disappeared eight years ago, but the statute of
limitations for simple intelligence activities is five years.
However, for more serious allegations such as treason, he could
still be charged.

   Former President Reagan frequently
travels these days to a Southern California hilltop to scrutinize
finishing touches on the nation's largest presidential library.
   ``He thought maybe the oak trees were getting too much water,
but otherwise he's pleased. He takes a real interest in his
library,'' said Charles H. Jeloian, director of the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Foundation.
   Reagan also was concerned about the flowering pear trees on a
library patio, but they came through the shock of transplanting and
were healthy by fall.
   ``He spends all afternoon here. He knows this place like the
back of his hand,'' said Jelloian.
   The 153,000-square-foot, Spanish-style library sits on a knoll
45 miles northwest of Los Angeles, a convenient stop between
Reagan's Bel-Air home and his Santa Barbara ranch. Ground-breaking
was held Nov. 21, 1988.
   The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library is on schedule and within
its $40 million budget. The structure should be completed by
Reagan's 80th birthday on Feb. 6 and a dedication ceremony will be
next November.
   The 100-acre site is impressive, with views of mountains and the
Pacific Ocean across open fields of brush, beavertail cactus and
wildflowers.
   Visitors enter large wrought-iron gates into a patio featuring a
fountain. A red-tile roof protects the adobe-look walls. Straight
ahead, on the second floor, are offices for Reagan and his wife.
   ``The president can walk out on the balcony and wave to
visitors,'' said Jelloian.
   More than 250,000 visitors are expected annually.
   Plasterers, painters and carpet layers now swarm over the
building, which will feature an archives section, gift shop, two
theaters, space for 30,000 gifts presented during Reagan's White
House years and a replica of the Oval Office.
   The library will be the repository for an expected 62 million
papers, exceeding President Nixon's 44 million.
   When the library opens, the non-profit foundation will turn it
over to the National Archives and Records Administration, which
will run the Reagan library with a staff of about 22 people and an
annual budget of $1.5 million.
   At the ground-breaking, Reagan said he hoped historians and
scholars would ``judge our efforts well.''

   A natural gas explosion rocked an apartment
complex at an Army base, killing a 5-year-old girl and injuring 17
residents and rescuers, authorities said.
   The girl's remains were discovered in the rubble of the building
at 9:30 a.m. today, about 12 hours after it blew up, officials at
Fort Benjamin Harrison said.
   The blast occurred hours after fire authorities arrived to
investigate a gas leak at another building in the complex. That
building was being evacuated when the blast hit several hundred
feet away, authorities said.
   The explosion, in a housing area for enlisted personnel,
destroyed a four-family housing unit and damaged another unit, said
post spokesman Maj. Ronald Downing.
   ``The fire engines were trying to get in and we were trying to
get out. It was total chaos,'' said Joan Adams, a resident of the
complex. She described people running through streets in their
pajamas, carrying children.
   At least 17 residents and firefighters were injured. By midday
today, three people were still listed in critical condition, one of
them a 4-year-old girl, authorities said.
   Marion County Deputy Coroner Charles W. Green said he could not
conclusively identify the dead child until after dental records
were checked. But base officials said there was little doubt it was
the 5-year-old girl who had been reported missing earlier.
   Firefighters and police called off their search through the
smoldering rubble after the body was found. The girl's identity was
not released. Other members of her family were among the injured,
Downing said.
   The post on the edge of town serves as a processing center for
soldiers en route to the Persian Gulf, although none of those
soldiers stayed in the affected area.
   Fire authorities had been called in about 5:45 p.m., or 3{ hours
before the blast, after people reported smelling gas, Downing said.
He said officials had planned to evacuate the 240-unit Harrison
Village complex before the explosion.
   Harley said authorities turned the gas off at one housing unit
where they thought the leak was occurring. But a nearby unit, where
the gas had not been turned off, blew up, he said.
   Some residents complained that they were not adequately warned.
   Adams, whose husband is a sergeant, said that about two hours
before the explosion, military police began telling residents that
a gas leak had been found elsewhere in the complex and would be
fixed.
   ``He told us there was no danger for us to stay there,'' she
said. Her family had planned to leave anyway, because the complex
was without heat and hot water, but the explosion happened before
they did so, she said.
   Lt. Col. Bill Carey, provost marshal, said the building where
the leak was detected was evacuated as a precaution, but ``we
didn't feel the whole area needed to be evacuated.''
   However, the blast occurred in another building about 800 to
1,000 feet away, he said, adding that ``prior to the explosion, we
had not been to this building.''
   The blast was felt more than two miles away. Wood and other
debris were scattered where a two-story building once stood. Rubble
was strewn over four blocks. About 210 families were evacuated
after the explosion.
   ``Insulation was coming down like snow when we got here. One
apartment was engulfed in flames and the other building was in
flames,'' said State Trooper Anthony Blackburn.

   Garbage bags began mounding on streets outside
fast-food establishments today as garbage collectors struck the
private carting companies that pick up trash from 250,000
businesses.
   No emergencies were reported on the first morning of missed
pickups, but the city Sanitation Department was ready to collect
garbage at any business sites where health or fire hazards were
certified.
   A 2,100-member Teamsters local called the strike Sunday after
union members rejected a second contract offer. Picket lines went
up Sunday night.
   The haulers pick up 10,000 tons of garbage daily from
restaurants, factories and other businesses, as well as
construction sites. The strike affects 475 carting companies with
total operations worth more than $1 billion a year.
   Collections of residential garbage, the province of the
Sanitation Department, was not affected by the strike.
   The walkout began officially Sunday night and the union said
this morning it was largely effective, but some trucks were making
pickups in the Bronx.
   ``They went out with management people and with scabs, and they
have a lot of police protection,'' said Bernard Adelstein,
secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 813.
   The union represents collectors in New York City and adjoining
suburban counties. Adelstein said no decision had been made yet on
whether the walkout will be spread to those counties, Westchester
and Putnam. He said there was no chance of a strike on Long Island,
where contracts run to 1992.
   This morning, little garbage was visible on such main midtown
thoroughfares as Broadway and Sixth Avenue, but accumulations began
appearing at curbside and against buildings on the side streets. At
one spot, between two high turnover restaurants on 48th Street at
Broadway and Seventh Avenue, the black plastic garbage bags
narrowed the passageway for pedestrians.
   Jim Grossman, a spokesman for the Uniformed Sanitationmen's
Association, which represents 7,000 municipal garbage collectors,
said the union will not pick up the businesses' trash without the
city declaring a health emergency.
   Such a declaration would obligate the union to pick up the
trash, he said.
   But he said, ``It's wintertime and the garbage can sit outside a
long time before it creates a health problem.''
   The union's last strike was in the winter of 1981 and lasted 17
days. The city declared a health emergency the day before it was
settled.
   The Teamsters rejected the first contract offer Dec. 2 but
postponed their strike deadline by one week at the request of Mayor
David Dinkins.
   The union demanded a three-year contract with 8 percent wage
increases each year - about $60 a week - and improved pension and
welfare benefits, said secretary-treasurer Bernard Adelstein.
Workers earn about $40,000 a year.
   The offer rejected Dec. 2 called for no pay increase the first
year, $25 a week in the second and $35 a week in the third.
   The proposal rejected Sunday offered slightly more, union
officials said. The old contract expired Nov. 30.
   No negotiations were scheduled.

<TEXT>
   A Tel Aviv court on Monday convicted a wealthy
socialite of a string of 22 armed bank robberies in which the
gunman became almost a cult figure with the nickname ``Bikerbank.''
   The three-judge panel of the Tel Aviv District Court set a
sentencing hearing for Feb. 11 for Roni Leibovitz, the national
news agency Itim reported.
   The robberies stretched over nearly two years because police
were unable to find a clue to the identity of the robber, whose
trademark was escaping on a motorcycle after firing a shot into the
bank ceiling.
   Liebovitz, 37, was arrested on Oct. 18 and later confessed to
the robberies, in which he took $175,500.
   Israeli newspapers and the state-run television devoted much
time and space to reporting the robberies and speculating on the
identity of the suspect.
   But Liebovitz failed to live up to the media's romantic image of
a tall, handsome robber - possibly a war hero gone wrong. Instead,
the robber turned out to be the son of a wealthy family whose
lavish livestyle led him into debt, according to news reports.
   The reports said Leibovitz's family founded a food and soap
factory called Etz Hazait, or Olive Tree, and has U.S. interests
that do hundreds of millions of dollars in business annually. The
family was said to have paid back the money to the banks.
   In arguing for a lenient sentence, defense lawyer Uri Slonim
said Leibovitz had admitted to the crimes and never shot anyone
during the robberies, Itim reported.

   Singer Bobby Helms says he was unsure
about mixing rock 'n' roll and Christmas, but his ``Jingle Bell
Rock'' has become a holiday classic.
   ``It's made itself a part of Christmas,'' said Helms, who
recorded the song in 1957.
   While many other holiday songs are mellow renditions dreaming of
a white Christmas or chestnuts roasting on an open fire, ``Jingle
Bell Rock'' is a snappy number that catches the excitement of the
year.
   ``It lifts people up,'' he said in a recent interview.
   Helms said that the song - written by Joe Beal and Jim Boothe -
was the first to tie in Christmas with rock 'n' roll, which was
just emerging in 1957.
   ``I wasn't sure about putting rock 'n' roll into Christmas,''
says Helms, 53, who lives in Martinsville, Ind. ``But it's just one
of those songs. You never know.''
   Besides ``Jingle Bell Rock,'' Helms had two other hit records:
``My Special Angel'' and ``Fraulein.'' His recording career
continued through the 1950s and 1960s. He later got into the
nightclub business and also sponsored music festivals.

   ASPEN, Colo. (AP) - Two of the most talked about women in
Hollywood - Oprah Winfrey and Cher - agree they like themselves
just the way they are.
   A crowd of fans showed up at the Wheeler Opera House over the
weekend to see Cher and Winfrey discuss Cher's new movie,
``Mermaids,'' and a variety of other topics during a taping of The
Oprah Winfrey Show.
   The segment is scheduled to air Friday. A second, more intimate
interview with Cher, taped at her Aspen home, will be televised
Dec. 31.
   Cher said she moved to Aspen recently because excessive media
exposure forced her to seek privacy. The singer-actress said she
was ``tired of having to defend my actions.''
   Winfrey said she admires Cher's confidence and announced that
she is trying to confront her own reality. Winfrey gained attention
two years ago when she lost 67 pounds on a crash diet. She has
since regained most of the weight and has no plans to diet again.
   ``I believed I was going to be among the 2 percent'' who don't
regain weight after dieting, she said. ``It pains me to say it, but
I was wrong. I recently said to the universe `OK take me, come on.'
I'm ready.''

   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The Princess of Wales visited a factory
and two charitable organizations Monday amid tight police security
following last week's arrest of three terrorist suspects.
   Hundreds of police were on hand to protect Lady Diana, the wife
of Prince Charles, one week after three Irish Republican Army
suspects were captured with guns and ammunition in Antwerp, 30
miles away.
   The three Irish citizens were charged with illegal weapon
possession. Police said it was not known if the three had planned
to attack the princess.
   The princess visited the Johnson Matthey PLC precious metals
factory, and opened the Brussels office of HelpAge International,
which is linked to the British charity organization ``Help the
Aged,'' of which she is patron.
   She also visited Belgian Queen Fabiola's children hospital.

   TULSA, Okla. (AP) - Country music singer Roy Clark joined more
than 2,000 motorcyclists who collected about $20,000 worth of toys
that the Salvation Army will distribute next week.
   Riders were required to bring a new, unwrapped toy for a child
14 years or younger during the 11th annual Motorcycle Toy Run.
Clark, who has been riding a motorcycle since 1949, said he brought
a football for a boy and a doll for a girl.
   ``I thought I'd be different,'' he said.
   The run was sponsored by A Brotherhood Aiming Toward Education,
a motorcycle rights group. Organizers say the amount of toys
collected Sunday was the most ever.
   One rider had 33 toys strapped to his motorcycle, some wore
Santa Claus suits and three couples got married in front of the toy
pile at the Oklahoma National Guard Armory.

   If Saddam Hussein's forces are left
intact after he is forced out of Kuwait, he will claim the late
Gamal Abdel Nasser's mantle as the champion of the Arab world,
Saudis fear.
   Saudi officials, speaking Monday on condition of anonymity,
echoed the concern voiced a day earlier by U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker III. Baker said that even a peaceful solution to the
Gulf crisis would be followed by continued pressure on Saddam to
curb his military power.
   ``He can't keep his military. He'll be a hero. He'll make Nasser
in 1956 look like Mickey Mouse,'' said one Saudi source.
   Nasser, the populist Egyptian president who died in 1970, became
an idol in the Arab world after standing up to the French and
British forces backing Israel in the 1956 attempt to reverse his
nationalization of the Suez Canal.
   He used his pan-Arab nationalism to appeal to public opinion
across North Africa and the Middle East, destablizing many
pro-Western governments in the process. His memory remains a potent
force in the Arab world today.
   The Saudis see history repeating itself in Saddam's vast
military arsenal and political ambitions.
   Saddam has the biggest and most powerful army in the Arab world,
with a million troops, a missile armory and other weapons of mass
destruction.
   Most officials expect he will find a way to extricate himselffrom Iraq
before being attacked by the 26-nation alliance that
began deploying troops to Saudi Arabia soon after Kuwait was
invaded Aug. 2.
   But even after a retreat, Saddam will ``say he stood up not just
to the United States, but to the whole world,'' a Saudi source
said.
   The future threat would be both political and military. Saddam's
invasion of Kuwait, an emirate disliked by poor Arabs for its vast
oil wealth and limited rights for foreign workers, struck a popular
chord in many parts of the Arab world.
   It added to his claim of achieving a victory against Iran, a
traditional Arab enemy, in the 1980-88 war, despite having gained
nothing in the end.
   ``They just love this white stallion stuff, Saladin and all
that,'' said an Asian diplomat, referring to the Arab general who
in 1187 recaptured Jerusalem from the European crusaders.
   Saddam, who likens himself to the Kurdish Saladin, is often
shown on Iraqi television heroically mounted on a white charger.
   ``Arabs will say, `he's tough, he can solve our problems, let's
follow him','' the diplomat added.
   Saddam has already tried to capitalize on that image with his
attempt to link his withdrawal to an Israeli pullout from the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Occupying another Arab land and torturing Arabs does not give
hope that the Palestinians can be liberated,'' said a senior Saudi
diplomat.
   The Saudis are concerned that what Saddam does not gain through
charisma he can achieve through the threat of force, especially if
he develops nuclear weapons within the next few years.
   They don't want U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq eases
unless Iraq reduces the size and power of his military, or at least
makes U.N.-backed guarantees not to use its arms again on fellow
Arabs.
   ``We can't just stop at the withdrawal. The Iraqi army has to be
reduced to a degree that it won't threaten us,'' said the senior
diplomat.
   The Saudis, despite buying billions of dollars' worth of
advanced weaponry over the last decade, found themselves hopelessly
unable to combat Saddam when he invaded Kuwait.
   The Saudis have embarked on a crash expansion of their military
and are buying weapons worth billions of dollars. But analysts say
that even when that program is completed, they will still not be
able to defend themselves without outside help.

<HEAD>Court to Decide News Media Confidentiality Issue in Minneapolis
Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 17-18, In the confidentiality, with reaction.</NOTE>

   The Supreme Court agreed today to decide
whether news media organizations enjoy any constitutional
protection against being sued over broken promises of
confidentiality.
   The justices said they will consider reinstating a $200,000
award against Minnesota's two largest newspapers won by a news
source whose identity was not kept confidential. The award had been
thrown out by the Minnesota Supreme Court.
   Public relations man Dan Cohen initially won a $700,000 award
against the Star Tribune of Minneapolis-St. Paul and the St. Paul
Pioneer Press Dispatch.
   A state appeals court ruled that a promise of confidentiality
given to Cohen by a reporter with each newspaper amounted to an
oral contract, but cut the award to $200,000. Cohen's victory was
overturned completely by the state Supreme Court last July.
   In other action the court:
   - Gave federal judges more power to decide lawsuits stemming
from labor disputes.
   The court unanimously reinstated a suit by two workers fired by
a Michigan company, Ring Screw Works. The workers sued after losing
grievances against the company.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said the
federal Labor Relations Management Act gives judges authority to
rule in such cases unless the collective bargaining agreement
between a union and management expressly forbids it.
   - Agreed to judge the validity of federal guidelines for
sentencing people convicted of trafficking in the hallucinogenic
drug LSD.
   The justices said they will decide whether the sentencing
guidelines, now based on the weight of the LSD and its ``carrier,''
must instead be based on the number of doses confiscated.
   - Asked the Bush administration for its views on whether a Civil
War era law enacted primarily to protect freed slaves bans racially
discriminatory firings.
   The justices said they want to hear from Justice Department
lawyers about a ruling that the manufacturer of Buster Brown shoes
was guilty of illegal racial bias when it fired a white supervisor
at a Missouri warehouse.
   - Agreed to decide whether prison inmates sometimes are entitled
to jury trials when suing prison officials over alleged
mistreatment.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by John J. McCarthy,
who accused officials at a state prison in Somers, Conn., of
violating is rights when they removed him from his cell in 1983.
   - Refused to postpone a Jan. 22 election under a redistricting
plan designed to help elect an Hispanic to the Los Angeles County
Board of Supervisors for the first time in 115 years.
   The court rejected an emergency request by board members, who
said the plan ordered by a federal judge is unlawful.
   In the confidentiality case, Cohen's attorney, Elliot
Rothenberg, expressed pleasure at the Supreme Court's decision to
take it up. ``The major issue will be, to what extent does the
First Amendment of the Constitution apply to contract law,'' he
said. ``Does it give newspapers the right to dishonor promises or
violate (oral) contracts with confidential sources?''
   Attorneys for the newspapers said they had not seen the court's
order and could not immediately comment on it.
   The controversy stems from a revelation during the 1982
Minnesota political campaign that Marlene Johnson, a Democratic
Farm Labor candidate for lieutenant governor, once had been
arrested and charged with shoplifting.
   Cohen, who was associated with the campaign of Wheelock Whitney,
the Independent-Republican candidate for governor, provided the
information on the condition he not be identified as the source.
   Reporters for the two papers gave that assurance, but their
editors ordered that Cohen's name be published because, they said,
the public should be told that the information came from someone
linked to Whitney's campaign.
   The same day he was named as the source in the newspaper stories
about Johnson, Cohen was fired from his advertising agency job.
   In voting 4-2 to throw out Cohen's ensuing lawsuit against the
newspapers, the state Supreme Court drew a distinction between
moral and legal obligations. It said promises of confidentiality
did not amount to oral contracts.
   ``To impose a contract theory on this arrangement puts an
unwarranted legal rigidity on a special ethical relationship,'' the
state court said.
   The state court also rejected arguments that Cohen was entitled
to collect monetary damages under a more general legal theory
governing broken promises.
   ``Enforcement of the promise of confidentiality under (such a)
theory would violate defendants' First Amendment rights,'' the
state court said.
   The Constitution's First Amendment guarantees freedom of the
press.
   Minnesota's highest court added: ``There may be instances where
a confidential source would be entitled to a remedy ... when the
state's interest in enforcing the promise to the source outweighs
First Amendment considerations, but this is not such a case.''
   The two dissenting state court justices called the ruling ``a
sad day in the history of a responsible press in America.''
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Cohen argued, ``This
court has not before accorded media organizations a constitutional
privilege to break promises or contracts with others or to be
immune from generally applicable laws. No one, including the news
media, should be above the law.''
   Lawyers for the two newspapers urged the justices to reject
Cohen's appeal.
   The case is Cohen vs. Cowles Media Co., 90-634.

   ABC Sports president Dennis Swanson got two
additional duties Monday: running the network's children's and
daytime programming.
   The move was part of a restructuring that followed the removal
of Michael Brockman as president of ABC's daytime, children's and
late-night entertainment.
   ABC assigned the late-night duties to Philip R. Beuth, a senior
vice president at the ABC Television Network Group, said the group
president, John B. Sias. Beuth also will continue overseeing the
top-rated ``Good Morning America.''
   Sias called Brockman's replacements ``two widely experienced
broadcasters who have demonstrated their keen ability to provide
excellent and successful entertainment programming in difficult and
competitive environments.''
   Brockman has attributed his departure to philosophical
differences with management.
   Brockman, who only had been on the job since April 1989,
previously held the same jobs at CBS, where he oversaw creation of
``The Pat Sajak Show,'' a late-night ratings bomb that was quickly
canceled.

<HEAD>Hostages Leaving; Iraq Insists It Will Keep Kuwait</HEAD>

   The first wave of American hostages freed under Saddam Hussein's
blanket release headed home today. But even as it relented and
released foreign captives, Iraq declared it would not compromise
``one iota'' over Kuwait.
   U.S. consular officials in Germany said 152 Americans and four
Canadians left Frankfurt on a Pan Am flight headed for Andrews Air
Force Base near Washington. Provisions aboard included hamburgers
and champagne.
   While expressing relief at the freeing of the hostages, the Bush
administration wants nothing less than Iraq's total withdrawal from
Kuwait.
   But the Baghdad government's information minister, Latif Jassim,
said today any talk of an Iraqi withdrawal from the emirate was
``nothing but dreams and wishful thinking.''
   ``Kuwait is for Iraqi, whether in the past, present or future,''
Jassim said in a statement carried by the official Iraqi News
Agency.
   ``We will not compromise one iota on Kuwaiti territory, its
waters or the money and investment of the buried Al-Sabah
dynasty,'' he said, referring to Kuwait's deposed ruling family.
   The Bush administration is urging a meeting between President
Saddam and James A. Baker III by Jan. 3 so Iraq would have time to
pull out by Jan. 15, the deadline set in the U.N. resolution
authorizing force to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   In the hostage exodus, an Iraqi Airlines jet left Baghdad for
London today carrying 384 Westerners, including 277 Britons and
some Americans. The exact number of Americans on the
British-chartered flight was not immediately known.
   Fourteen other Westerners - a Canadian, seven Irishmen, five
Britons and a Dutchman - flew to Amman, Jordan, earlier today
aboard a scheduled Iraqi Airways flight.
   The Americans who left Frankfurt today were among about 175
former captives who had arrived a day earlier from Baghdad aboard a
U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways jet. Some spoke of hiding barefoot in
Kuwait City apartments, others of being held captive in ``gulags''
at strategic sites around Iraq.
   The flight from Baghdad also included 101 former British
hostages, who were flown this morning from Frankfurt to London,
where they were greeted by jubilant relatives and government
officials.
   ``I feel euphoric,'' said one of the freed British captives,
45-year-old Harvey May.
   U.S. officials said they planned to charter another flight in
three or four days to evacuate the rest of the estimated 750
Americans in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Twenty-one former American hostages landed in Houston on Sunday.
They left Baghdad on Saturday aboard a jet chartered by former
Treasury Secretary John Connally, who was in Iraq on a private
mission to free hostages.
   About 8,000 Westerners had been prevented from leaving Iraq and
Kuwait since Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, including about 600 who
were held at strategic sites to guard against a feared attack by
U.S-led forces.
   Saddam announced Thursday that they could all go home.
   The move came a week after the U.N. Security Council approved
the use-of-force resolution, which President Bush followed up by
inviting Iraq to exchange envoys in an effort to avoid war.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz plans to visit Washington for
a meeting with Bush, possibly on Dec. 17. Baker's trip to Baghdad
would follow some time later, but Iraqi and U.S. officials have yet
to agree on a date.
   Baker said that if Saddam does not agree to a meeting by Jan. 3,
it will show the Iraqi leader is not serious about averting war.
   A meeting Jan. 12, as proposed by Baghdad, would not give Iraq
enough time to withdraw from its oil-rich neighbor before the Jan.
15 deadline, Baker said.
   The Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations, Abdul Amir
Al-Anbari, said the meeting might be scheduled earlier. Speaking on
NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' he said the disagreement over
scheduling was ``a minute one.''
   British and Arab newspapers reported Sunday that Iraq had
redrawn its border with Kuwait in possible preparation for a
partial pullout from Kuwait.
   The reports, in the Observer of London and the Al-Khaleej daily
in Abu Dhabi, said Saddam's aim was to keep the entire Rumailah
oilfield and two islands, Warba and Bubiyan, which would give it
open access to the Persian Gulf. The oilfield, which lies chiefly
in Iraq, extends two miles into Kuwait and Saddam accused Kuwait of
overexploiting it before he invaded.
   The weekly Observer, citing unidentified Arab sources in
Washington, said ``most Arab governments expect Iraq to withdraw
from the rest of Kuwait in late January'' but completion of a new
border fence around Rumailah's southern time indicates an even
earlier withdrawal.
   Baker said that in his meeting with Saddam he would not agree to
give Iraq all of Rumailah because ``to say anything else would be
to reward an aggressor.''
   Baker predicted the public would support using force even if
Iraq demanded only a small part of Kuwait because Americans would
want to stand up against ``international outlaws like this man.''
   The United States has 250,000 troops in the gulf and plans to
build that force up to 400,000 by mid-January. The anti-Iraq
coalition includes an estimated 100,000 troops from other nations.

   He's been called the Mayor of Capitol Hill.
The Democrats' Mr. Goodwrench. Mr. Fix-it. The Prince of Perks.
   They're all appropriate descriptions of Rep. Vic Fazio of
California, Congress' point man when it comes to securing pay
raises and financing incumbents' built-in advantages over their
challengers.
   And he's sick of them.
   ``It is not a very clear picture of me. It's very
one-dimensional. My interests have been much broader,'' he
complains.
   Breaking loose, Fazio has parlayed the points he scored as Mr.
Inside for a shot at Mr. Outside, a chance to become a national
mover in the Democratic Party. House Democratic colleagues last
week elected him chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee.
   He'll represent their interests as the party goes into the
crucial 1992 elections. Many secure, senior Democrats are expected
to retire as congressional district boundaries are redrawn to
comply with the new census data.
   It's a job that will require an instinct for issues, a mastery
of demographic detail and a knack for emptying the wallets of
campaign contributors.
   Anyone who believes Fazio was given that job just because he
helped secure members a big pay raise last year would be wrong.
They'd also be wrong if they thought that had nothing to do with
it.
   The fact is that Democrats see Fazio as a jockey who can ride
any horse to victory, even the ugly ones. And sometimes he seems to
ride more than one at a time.
   In 12 years in the House, Fazio, 48, has never limited himself
to the insider tasks for which he is known.
   He's done everything from fighting for cutbacks in the MX
missile system, to securing tougher environmental rules for
offshore oil drilling, to winning $2.8 billion in earthquake aid
for his state after the 1989 San Francisco-area disaster.
   At the same time, he set up a political action committee to help
fellow Democrats win re-election and has headed Impact 2000, the
party's effort to prepare for the upcoming redistricting.
   In the shakeup that followed the resignation of former Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas, Fazio a few years ago stepped onto the track
that has now led him to the DCCC chairmanship. He became vice
chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and is keeping that job,
the first time the Democrats have put one person in two leadership
posts.
   If he's been labeled Mr. Inside, it's his own fault.
   As chairman of the Legislative Branch subcommittee, Fazio is
responsible for day-to-day budgeting of the institution. He's done
the job better than many might think prudent, all the while waiting
impatiently, finger-tapping impatiently, for the day he can dump
that committee chairmanship for a better one.
   It's as if he can't find enough things to do.
   Speaker Thomas S. Foley said of Fazio: ``If I had a machine to
clone him, I would do it. He is the most effective member of
Congress I ever met.''
   Republicans are equally impressed, if less complimentary. House
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., once called him ``a nice, clean
machine politician,'' the Democrats' ``consigliere,'' the term used
for a trusted counselor in the Mafia.
   For now, Fazio is counseling unity for his party.
   On the Persian Gulf, he sees little room for partisan advantage
and worries that Democratic doubts could ``reassert that image of
the Democratic party as appeasers.''
   On the slumping economy, he believes the traditional Democratic
answer of jobs programs is ``passe.''
   And, true to form, he's not afraid to talk about the
nitty-gritty.
   ``It's going to be a very, very bad year for fundraising for the
House,'' he said, with House members competing for a
``theoretically finite amount of money'' with Democratic Senate and
presidential candidates.
   He expects he'll need ``to find 60 to 75 new candidates of real
quality ... people who can win'' the open seats created by
retirements and the redistricting.
   Fazio says he considers his national party efforts ``totally
really apart from the legislative branch-related activities. It's
really two different worlds and they don't overlap very much.''
   They do in one way. The Democrats are counting on him to do the
dirty work, to be their Mr. Fix-it.

<HEAD>Milosevic, Communists Headed For Victory In Serbia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Serbia's ruling Communists and their
hard-line President Slobodan Milosevic were headed Monday for an
election victory that could split Yugoslavia apart.
   As official returns trickled in from Serbia's first free ballot
since 1938, the renamed Socialists and Milosevic took a commanding
lead over their main challengers, the center-right nationalist
Serbian Renewal Movement.
   A victory for Milosevic and his party is almost certain to
deepen the rift between Serbia and the pro-Western republics of
Croatia and Slovenia, where center-right parties ousted Communists
in spring elections.
   The opposition charged the Communists with widespread
vote-rigging. International observers said they believed Sunday's
election was essentially fair, but indicated Communist domination
of Serbia's media made for a biased campaign.
   In Montenegro, Communists were already celebrating what they
claimed to be an overwhelming victory over 10 opposition parties,
according to unofficial returns reported by the state Tanjug news
agency.
   Tanjug said the Communist candidate for Montenegro's presidency,
Momir Bulatovic, appeared as likely as Milosevic to win outright
without being forced into a runoff.
   A runoff vote will be held Dec. 23 for any of the 250 parliament
seats in Serbia or 125 seats in Montenegro in constituencies where
no single candidate wins 50 percent.
   ``All I can say is they are leading and leading well,'' Jova
Vukelic, spokesman for the Serbian Democratic Party, said of
Milosevic's Socialists. Vukelic said he based his comment on
partial results reaching his party.
   Tanjug said the Socialists had won nearly 80 seats in the
Serbian parliament, according to an unofficial survey of 140 out of
250 districts.
   ``Initial results indicate that the Communists will have at
least a 60 percent majority over the opposition in parliament,''
said Dragan Veselinov, president of the opposition Peasant's Party.
   ``We should be happy if they win only 60 percent. I'm afraid
they could win by an even higher margin,'' said Vojislav Kostunica
of the Democratic Party.
   The outcome of the vote in Serbia is likely to decide whether
this volatile Balkan country stays together or breaks up.
   The newly elected governments in Slovenia and Croatia advocate
greater democracy and have threatened to secede if Yugoslavia's
federation of six republics does not transform into a loose
confederation of near-independent states.
   Milosevic has refused to acknowledge the possibility of a
federal break-up or to negotiate with the western republics.
   His main rival for president, Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian
Renewal Movement, has said he would negotiate with Croatia and
Slovenia.
   Electoral Commission Chairman Caslav Ignjatovic said he was
investigating claims of ballot-rigging and widespread
irregularities at the Serbian republic's 9,500 polling stations.
   Draskovic said the Socialists distributed campaign leaflets at
polling stations Sunday and that pro-government media also ignored
a ban on campaigning 48 hours before the election.
   Opposition leaders also claimed the Socialists stopped
registering deaths in Serbia in April and rigged the election,
using phantom votes.
   ``In terms of procedures at individual voting places, the
elections passed fairly well,'' said Robert Hand, an official of
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
monitored the Serbian elections.
   ``Our main concern is what happened before the elections,'' Hand
said. He said the group was unhappy with the limited opposition
access to the Communist-controlled media during the campaign.
   Serbia's state-controlled media claimed the opposition parties
were pro-Western enemies of the republic whose victory could lead
to civil war with other Yugoslav regions.
   The divisions among Serbs, Croats and Slovenes reflect the babel
of ethnic and political forces vying for power in Yugoslavia. The
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency predicted recently that the
country could be torn apart within 18 months and said civil war was
possible.

<HEAD>Former Public Enemy No. 1 Killed by Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALENCON, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police killed a man once considered
France's public enemy No. 1 during a robbery attempt at the home of
an elderly widow, officials said Monday.
   A policeman was wounded in the abdomen in the exchange of
gunfire Sunday night, and Jean-Charles Willoquet, 46, was killed by
a bullet to the head, officials said.
   Willoquet was granted early release last year from a prison term
imposed after he was convicted of attempted murder and hostage
taking during a 1975 escape.
   On Sunday, he and an accomplice entered the Normandy home of
Rosa Kahn, 81, representing themselves as policemen investigating a
band of thieves, police said. A young girl called police after
hearing cries from Mrs. Kahn, who was beaten.
   In the ensuing gunfire, Willoquet died, the policeman was
wounded and Willoquet's accomplice escaped in a car.
   Willoquet was first arrested in 1968, when police said he was
working by day as a hair stylist and burglarizing chateaux in the
Loire Valley in his free time. He was sentenced to five years in
prison, with three years suspended.
   He was arrested again in 1974 in Paris in connection with 11
armed attacks and a dozen racketeering charges.
   During his trial in 1975, he earned a reputation as public enemy
No. 1 by escaping from the Palais de Justice with the aid of his
wife, who entered the hearing room disguised in the black robe of a
French lawyer.
   She took out a grenade and passed her husband a pistol.
Willoquet took the judge and his assistant hostage and fled,
wounding two gendarmes. He was captured a year later, months after
his wife was apprehended.
   He was sentenced to serve two concurrent 20-year terms and was
freed after 14 years. He wrote a book, ``Anything To Be Free,''
while serving time.

<HEAD>Supreme Court to Consider Media Source Protection Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said Monday it will decide
whether news organizations enjoy some constitutional protection
against being sued for breaking promises to keep a source's
identity a secret.
   The court voted to consider reinstating a $200,000 award against
Minnesota's two largest newspapers. It was won, and then lost, by a
news source whose identity was not kept confidential.
   The award had been thrown out by the Minnesota Supreme Court.
   Before beginning a four-week holiday recess, the court also:
   -Ruled unanimously in a Michigan case that workers may sue their
employers after losing union grievance complaints. The decision
reversed a federal appeals court ruling that a labor strike is a
union's only recourse when its workers lose grievances.
   -Agreed to judge in a Wisconsin case the validity of federal
guidelines for sentencing people convicted of trafficking in the
hallucinogenic drug LSD.
   -Refused to postpone a Jan. 22 election under a redistricting
plan designed to help elect the first Hispanic in 115 years to the
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.
   -Asked the Bush administration, in a case from Missouri, for its
views on the scope of a key civil rights law forbidding racially
discriminatory firings.
   In the dispute over confidential sources, public relations man
Dan Cohen initially won a $700,000 award against the Star Tribune
of Minneapolis-St. Paul and the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch. A
state appeals court reduced the award to $200,000.
   During the 1982 Minnesota political campaign, Cohen told
reporters for the two papers that Marlene Johnson, a Democratic
Farm Labor candidate for lieutenant governor, once had been
arrested and charged with shoplifting.
   Cohen, who was associated with the campaign of Wheelock Whitney,
the Independent-Republican candidate for governor, provided the
information on the condition he not be identified as the source.
   Reporters for the two papers gave that assurance, but their
editors ordered that Cohen's name be published.
   The same day he was named as the source in the newspaper stories
about Johnson, Cohen was fired from his advertising agency job.
   In voting 4-2 to throw out Cohen's ensuing lawsuit against the
newspapers, the state Supreme Court rejected arguments that Cohen
was entitled to collect monetary damages for the broken promise.
   ``Enforcement of the promise of confidentiality under (such a)
theory would violate defendants' First Amendment rights,'' the
state court said.
   The Constitution's First Amendment guarantees freedom of the
press.
   The two dissenting state court justices called the ruling ``a
sad day in the history of a responsible press in America.''
   Cohen's lawyer, Elliot Rothenberg, said he was pleased by
Monday's court action. He said the justices must decide whether the
First Amendment gives news organizations ``the right to dishonor
promises or violate (oral) contracts with confidential sources.''
   The Minnesota Supreme Court, however, ruled that the promise of
confidentiality made to Cohen did not amount to an oral contract.
   ``I'm very surprised the justices agreed to review this case.
Most of the scenarios are pretty terrible,'' said Jane Kirtley of
the Washington-based Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.
``The case really is about journalistic ethics, not legally
cognizable issues.''
   If the justices reverse the Minnesota court's ruling and fail to
make an an exception for reporters ordered by courts to divulge
their sources, she said, ``reporters will face the choice of
revealing a source and getting sued or not revealing a source and
going to jail.''
   Ms. Kirtley said the practical impact might not be great if the
Minnesota court's ruling were reversed in a decision that made
clear reporters could not be sued when forced by court order to
reveal a source.
   ``But such a ruling would be significant as another chink out of
the First Amendment armor,'' she said.

   The Supreme Court ruled Monday that a federal
law designed to promote labor peace gives federal judges broad
power to resolve disputes between employers and their workers.
   Voting 9-0, the justices revived a lawsuit by two workers who
said they were fired unjustly by Ring Screw Works in Michigan. The
workers sued after losing grievances against the company.
   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens said the
federal Labor Relations Management Act empowers judges to decide
such suits unless the collective bargaining agreement between
workers and their employers expressly forbids it.
   ``There is a strong presumption that favors access to a neutral
forum for the peaceful resolution of disputes,'' Stevens said.
   A contract that gives unions the right to strike and management
the right to impose a lockout over deadlocked grievances does not
automatically strip federal judges of authority to rule in those
disputes, he said.
   The courts are barred from acting only if both sides in the
disputes ``expressly agree to resort to economic warfare rather
than to mediation, arbitration or judicial review,'' Stevens said.
   Arthur Groves was fired by Ring Screw Works for allegedly
excessive unexcused absences from work. Bobby Evans was dismissed
for allegedly falsifying company records.
   Both men denied the charges but lost grievance complaints
against the company. They then sued the company for firing them
without due cause in violation of the Labor Relations Management
Act.
   The United Automobile Workers Union joined the lawsuits on the
side of the workers.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld a ruling
by a federal judge who threw out the suits.
   The appeals court said the UAW contract with Ring Screw Works
implies that a strike is the union's only recourse when workers
lose grievances. Union members voted against striking after Groves
and Evans lost their grievances.
   The appeals court said the workers would be permitted to sue
only if they accused the union of breaching its duty to represent
them fairly, and the fired workers made no such claim.

   Much of Europe dug out Monday from a heavy
snowfall that snarled traffic and left thousands without
electricity. At least 12 people were killed and nine were missing
in the Continent's first storm of the winter season.
   Snow fell in France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and
Austria. In southern Europe, heavy rains flooded Venice and forced
the suspension of ferry services.
   Torrential rains fell on the French Riviera. Police in Nice said
two French people were killed Sunday night along the French-Italian
border when bad weather sent rocks falling onto their car.
   Police in Britain, where snow turned to rain and sleet Monday,
said 10 people were killed.
   Five mountain climbers were missing in northern Spain, where
small towns were cut off by the heavy snow. Seven major highway
mountain passes were closed in the provinces of Burgos, Cantabria,
Leon and Soria.
   A Spanish Air Force helicopter and a merchant marine tug
searched off the northern Spanish coast for four people on a French
yacht missing in the Bay of Biscay.
   Roads were closed in the central Portugal Serra de Estrela
range.
   Southeastern and central France were hit by heavy snowfall. The
main highway between Lyon and Grenoble was inaccessible, with
traffic rerouted to a small, one-lane highway. The Mount Blanc
tunnel through the Alps was closed.
   In Switzerland, snow closed roads and delayed train and bus
traffic. The Zermatt ski resort reported 3 feet of snow in 24
hours.
   In Austria, avalanche danger closed many roads in parts of East
Tyrol and western Carinthia. In northern Tyrol, ice on the Inntal
highway caused a 21-car pileup. Police said several people were
injured.
   German police reported numerous accidents on the southern German
autobahns because of heavy snow. Drivers were advised to use chains
on alpine roads.
   Schools in Turin were closed as northern Italy dug out from its
first pre-Christmas snow since 1964. Snow fell Sunday on Mount
Vesuvius and the island of Ischia in the Bay of Naples, where heavy
winds halted ferry traffic.
   Wind-driven seas flooded Venice. By daybreak Monday, 40 percent
of the city was flooded, including low-lying St. Mark's Square.
   Train travel was disrupted as British Rail tried to clear
snow-covered lines. British Rail said it had only two snowplow
locomotives for 10,000 miles of track. It was considered a waste of
money to buy more when the country did not have heavy snow every
winter, the state-run network said.
   Six people were expected to appear before magistrates Monday in
Coventry, England, where looters stole jewelry, clothes and stereos
while police car patrols were halted by snow. Later, officers were
sent out on foot.

<HEAD>NTSB Chairman Presses States to Lift Licenses of Drunken Drivers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top federal safety official called Monday
for a national campaign to persuade 21 remaining states to pass
laws to immediately
   confiscate the licenses of drivers who fail or refuse
drunken-driving tests.
   James L. Kolstad, chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, told a meeting of the National Commission on Drunk Driving
that license confiscation is a ``simple, direct and inexpensive''
way to attack a problem blamed for 60 deaths a day or nearly 22,000
fatalities a year.
   Such laws already have been passed by 29 states and the District
of Columbia, and Kolstad said they have resulted in substantial
decreases of drunken driving.
   Kolstad noted that the deaths of eight persons in the collision
of two Northwest Airlines passenger jets at Detroit Metropolitan
Airport a week ago ``flashed across the TV screens and the front
pages of our newspapers.''
   ``And almost immediately the calls for corrective action to
prevent that kind of accident from happening again were heard,'' he
said.
   He said that while the response was understandable and correct,
``it is disappointing that society does not get equally concerned
when transportation deaths occur on our nation's roads and
highways.''
   ``Drunk driving is one of the leading causes of death in our
country today and it is totally preventable,'' Kolstad said.
   Kolstad noted that a recent safety board study found that a
third of fatally injured truck drivers tested positive for alcohol
or drugs.
   ``Four out of five of these drivers had a history of substance
abuse before their fatal accidents,'' he said.
   Kolstad's proposal, recently listed as one of the safety board's
``most-wanted'' safety changes, would require the immediate
confiscation of a license if a driver either fails a sobriety test
or refuses to take one.
   Under the program, a driver is given a temporary license and
given the option of an administrative hearing.
   ``That hearing establishes only one basic fact: did the driver
indeed fail the test or refuse to take it?'' Kolstad said. ``If the
answer is `yes,' the driver's license is revoked on the spot.
   ``The driver may still face criminal charges later, but the
important result is that they are taken off the road in very short
order,'' he said. ``There are no appeals, no dilatory tactics, no
mitigating circumstances, no plea bargaining, no pre-trial
diversion. The drunk driver is taken off the road.
   ``This approach works and it works well,'' he said, adding that
it deters not only drivers found drunk behind the wheel but also
those who have not been caught but who will fear losing their
driving privileges.
   Kolstad urged a lobbying campaign ``to convince legislators and
governors of the common sense necessity'' of administrative license
revocation laws.
   According to the Safety Board, the 21 states which have not
passed such laws are: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.

   The Supreme Court indicated interest Monday in
an important civil rights issue - whether a Civil War-era law
enacted primarily to protect freed slaves bans racially
discriminatory firings.
   The justices asked the Bush administration for its views on the
issue, urging Justice Department lawyers to comment on a ruling
that the manufacturer of Buster Brown shoes was guilty of illegal
racial bias when it fired a white supervisor at a Missouri
warehouse.
   After hearing from the government lawyers, which could be months
away, the court will decide whether it wants to hear the case.
   Kenneth Hicks, a white foreman with the Brown Shoe Company, was
fired in 1982 after 34 years with the firm.
   The company, in trimming its work force, dismissed Hicks while
keeping another supervisor, Alvin Chester, who is black.
   Hicks said he was fired because of his race, even though he had
more seniority than Chester.
   The shoe company asked the high court to overturn rulings in
favor of Hicks, who was awarded $10,000 in punitive damages and
nearly $21,000 more in attorney fees.
   The Supreme Court, in a highly publicized ruling in 1989 on the
Civil War-era law, left unanswered whether the act specifically
applies to racially biased firings.
   The law at issue was enacted in 1866 and provides that ``all
persons ... shall have the same right...to make and enforce
contracts ... and to the full and equal benefit of all laws ...
enjoyed by white citizens.''
   The 1964 Civil Rights law offers similar protection. But the
older statute authorizes broader remedies, particularly punitive
damages.
   In another civil rights case Monday the court refused to
postpone a Jan. 22 election under a redistricting plan designed to
help elect a Hispanic to the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors for the first time in 115 years.
   The court rejected an emergency request by board members, who
said the plan ordered by a federal judge is unlawful.
   But the justices took no action on a formal appeal by board
members still pending before the high court.
   The five-member board was accused by Hispanics in 1988 of
violating their rights by drawing districts after the 1980 census
that allegedly diluted Hispanic voting strength.
   U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon declared the former district
plan unconstitutional and carved out a new district in which
Hispanics account for an estimated 51 percent of the registered
voters and 71 percent of the population.
   The Bush administration sided with Hispanic rights groups in
urging the Supreme Court not to disturb Kenyon's ruling, which was
upheld last month by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

<HEAD>President-Elect Walesa Returns To Shipyard Where His Battle Began</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President-elect Lech Walesa returned to
his old shipyard Monday and appealed for help in building a new
government. Prosecutors said his defeated challenger must remain in
Poland to answer slander charges.
   Walesa spent the day wrapping up Solidarity duties, one day
after his landslide victory over businessman Stanislaw Tyminski in
Poland's first popular presidential election.
   Union leaders began selecting a new chairman. They also began
preparing for free spring parliamentary elections, when Solidarity
may form a political wing, and planning for the expected exodus of
activists to the government in Warsaw.
   ``I have to think as the president,'' said Walesa, touring
offices in the Baltic seaside town of Sopot, where he will work
when not at Belweder Palace in Warsaw.
   Challenger Stanislaw Tyminski, apparently conceding defeat, sent
Walesa a two-sentence telegram wishing him success.
   ``I hope you will not make a lot of mistakes and you can create
conditions for normal life in a strong, independent Poland,'' he
said.
   Walesa will be sworn in to a five-year term as president about
Dec. 21, barring protests of the vote, parliament Speaker Mikolaj
Kozakiewicz said.
   Walesa received 74.25 percent of the vote to Tyminski's 25.75
percent, according to national election commission results.
   About 14.2 million people voted. Turnout was put at 53 percent,
compared with 60 percent during the first round of voting Nov. 25.
   Walesa took time for two emotional tributes. He visited the
department where he fixed electric carts when the Gdansk Shipyard
was still named for Lenin. On Tuesday he was to travel - like
Poland's kings - to pay homage before the Black Madonna icon at
Jasna Gora monastery in Czestochowa, Poland's holiest shrine.
   At the shipyard, where he led his first strike almost exactly 20
years ago during December 1970 food riots, the 47-year-old Walesa
asked his old foreman and co-workers to ``be my support.''
   ``I am going to return here often and I am going to do
everything for you,'' he told workers. ``I know where I have this
white shirt from and I know that my overalls here were the same as
yours, sometimes even dirtier.''
   Walesa carried every province, according to unofficial results.
Tyminski did best in rural areas, where farmers are discontented
with economic reforms that nolonger guarantee a minimum price for
their products but have not dismantled the purchasing monopolies.
   ``There are many people in Poland for whom it is really bad,''
Walesa said. ``We must ... make Poland such that those doubters
quickly join us.''
   Walesa is under pressure to chart quickly policies that will
continue Poland's painful course toward a market economy while
answering the dissatisfaction of Tyminski's sizable minority. He
has promised by Wednesday to pick among the candidates he is
considering for prime minister.
   Tyminski suggested Sunday night he might challenge the returns,
but election officials reported no contact with him. He vowed to
remain active in Polish politics.
   ``Even if there are difficulties, I am now the second person in
Poland. That is our victory,'' he said.
   A local prosecutor in southern Poland lodged the slander case
against Tyminski after he accused Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki
of treason by creating economic chaos. Tyminski defeated Mazowiecki
in the first round of presidential voting.
   Walesa said Tyminski ought to account for unsubstantiated
allegations, but added that for now: ``It is a government matter.''
   A Dec. 7 order summoned Tyminski for questioning before the
prosecutor in Nowy Sacz, and the general prosecutor in Warsaw
confirmed to the PAP news agency that steps were taken ``ensuring
Tyminski's presence in the country until the hearing.''
   After questioning, it will be determined if Tyminski must stay
in Poland until a verdict on the slander case, the ministry said.
   PAP quoted sources as saying Tyminski and his wife, whose
children are in Toronto, had booked airline tickets Wednesday to
Canada. Tyminski has Canadian, Peruvian and Polish citizenships.
   Meanwhile, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was among the
first to wish Walesa success: ``History and life prove convincingly
the need to develop cooperation and interaction between our states
and peoples,'' Tass said.
   Among others congratulating him were President Bush, outgoing
President Wojciech Jaruzelski, who interned Walesa after declaring
martial law nine years ago Thursday, and Mazowiecki, who resigned
after his defeat.

   President Bush emphasized the plight of the
people of Kuwait as he signed a Human Rights Day proclamation on
Monday.
   Despite progress in some countries, ``millions of men, women and
children around the world continue to be denied the freedom to
live, work and worship as they wish,'' the president said.
   ``Nowhere is that situation more tragic and more urgent today
than in Kuwait,'' Bush told an audience of 150.
   ``We must speak out and stand up for the Kuwaiti people, a
people whose very nation is now in the grasp of a tyrant unmoved by
human decency,'' said Bush.
   ``The eyewitness accounts that I have heard from Kuwaiti
citizens are a catalog of human misery: looting, torture, rape,
summary execution, acts of unspeakable cruelty. What has happened
to Kuwait is more than an invasion. It is a systematic assault on
the soul of a nation.''
   The document proclaimed Monday as Human Rights Day and urged
Americans to observe this week as Human Rights Week.
   The president, joined by former Chief Justice Warren Burger,
also designated this Saturday as Bill of Rights Day.
   Burger heads a commission that is coordinating events marking
the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights, the first 10
amendments to the Constitution.

   Compliment him on his hairy chest. Compliment
him on his natty wardrobe. But don't call ``Godfather III'' star
Andy Garcia a ``Hispanic heartthrob.''
   ``There's nothing that I cherish more than my culture and what I
am,'' Garcia says in January's Glamour magazine. ``But to call me
the great Hispanic actor is ridiculous; it's racism. They don't
call Dustin Hoffman the great Jewish-American actor.''
   Garcia's family fled Cuba for Miami in 1961 when he was 5.
   Garcia, 34, who plays Vincent Mancini, the illegitimate son of
Sonny Corleone in the latest ``Godfather'' movie, says his Cuban
heritage is ``the source of my strength.'' But it also caused him
to get boxed into Latino roles during his 13-year career, which
included parts in ``The Untouchables,'' ``Internal Affairs'' and
``Black Rain.''
   Though his fame is increasing, Garcia's ego apparently is not.
   Told he looks handsome in the tuxedo he wears in the movie,
Garcia bowed his head and told the interviewer: ``Vincent thanks
you.'' Told the interviewer also was fond of his ``glorious
chest,'' the actor replied:
   ``I can't take responsibility for the chest. It's a genetic
thing.''

   Keeping his oft-repeated election promise
that he would work relentessly, President-elect Lech Walesa clocked
in at Solidarity headquarters just after 9 a.m. Monday - only hours
after his landslide victory.
   Walesa used his first full day as president-elect to touch base
with union supporters, make a nostalgic visit to his former
workplace and consult with advisers on government appointments.
   Arriving in a new Volvo escorted by three police cars, Walesa
promised ecstatic supporters waiting there to ``always return to my
union roots.'' The headquarters is just steps from the Gdansk
Shipyard where it all began.
   He said he would make a pilgrimage Tuesday to the Black Madonna
of Czestochowa in southern Poland - the icon whose image he wears
on his left lapel - in thanks for his election victory.
   Then he went on to the shipyard where time and again h defied
the former Communist government.
   ``I remember that I came from the shipyard and I came from there
without a tie and a suit,'' he said surrounded by former workmates.
   As he walked through the shipyard one of the workers called out:
``Neither you nor Tyminski are fit for the presidency.''
   ``You've always been like that. You haven't changed a bit,''
came Walesa's reply, flippant as he often is when talking to the
workers who have provided the backbone of his electorate.
   He went on to the department where he fixed electrical carts
while still at the shipyard, to be greeted by his old foreman.
   ``I knew it would happen some day,'' his former boss said.
   ``You have to come and help me now,'' Walesa replied.
   ``I am going to return here often and I am going to do
everything for you to live better,'' he told those who had stood
alongside him so often in the past.
   ``I know where I have this white shirt from and I know that my
overalls here were the same as yours, sometimes even dirtier,'' he
said.
   Frequently during his campaign Walesa claimed he did not want to
be president, but had to be in order to rescue Poland during the
difficult times that lie ahead.
   ``I will ... return here and ask you (for advice), and I will do
it for you and not for myself.''
   ``This is what we hope for,'' a worker said.
   ``All people at the top should follow you and work for the
nation and not for themselves,'' another added.
   ``But he's our president, don't worry,'' another answered.
   Earlier, speaking at Solidarity headquarters, Walesa said: ``The
union will get strengthened. I will help the union very much,
remembering that here are my roots.''

<HEAD>Dispute Over Blind Minister's Guide Dog Resolved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THERESA HUMPHREY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ELLENDALE, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blind clergyman can return to the
pulpit after a 10-week absence now that he's won permission to have
his guide dog in church.
   The decision was announced at Sunday's service at Mount Zion AME
church. The Rev. Le Roy Singleton, an associate pastor, was sitting
in the fourth row with his wife, Emma, and his guide dog, Digby.
   Singleton's vision had been failing for years because of
glaucoma and diabetes.
   He got the German shepherd-collie mixed breed in September, but
he said the Rev. Ellsworth Coleman, the church's pastor, told him
the dog was not welcome in the church.
   Singleton, who had been sitting in the pulpit, moved to the back
pews with the dog, saying he did not want to cause any problems in
the church. He also stopped performing ministerial duties.
   Singleton blamed a church member, whom he did not identify, for
causing the dispute.
   ``This person caused the dissension, saying that when Reverend
Singleton gets back with his dog, you won't even be able to shake
his hand and you won't even be able to get close to talk to him or
this dog will chew you up. ... This is not an attack dog,''
Singleton said.
   The dispute ended Saturday after a meeting between Singleton and
Coleman and the decision was announced the next day.
   ``I'm allowed to come in church and I'm allowed to sit where I
want to sit and that's all I wanted from the beginning,''
Singleton, 62, told the congregation.
   ``There will be times when I will be asked to preach again and
that's solely up to him (Coleman),'' Singleton said.
   ``We stand now united together,'' Coleman said.
   Earlene A. Hughes, president of the Delaware affiliate of the
National Federation of the Blind, said she believes the issue is
resolved.
   ``The public needs to be more aware that blind persons are
capable of leading normal and productive lives as much as their
sighted partners and I hope that this will be an educational
experience for the people of Delaware,'' Hughes said.
   The federation became involved because it wanted to make sure
Singleton was not a victim of discrimination.

<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng said Monday the Communist Party
Central Committee is finally ready to decide on the economic
strategy that will guide China into the 21st century.
   ``I believe the time for convening that meeting is now
completely ripe and I am sure that we can achieve the expected
results,'' Li said at the airport before leaving on a 10-day tour
of Southeast Asia.
   He will visit Laos, becoming the first Chinese premier to do so,
as well as the Philippines, Sri Lanka and the first stop, Malaysia.
   The 175-member party Central Committee generally meets in the
early autumn. It was expected to do so this year to approve new
Five- and Ten-Year Plans for the economy to take effect on Jan. 1,
when the old plans expire.
   But intense backstage wrangling over the pace of economic reform
and development priorities has stalled the drafting of plans.
   Li said the Central Committee will meet at the end of December,
but did not give a specific date. He said the economic plans will
be the only agenda item, dispelling rumors that several ministerial
changes also will be discussed.
   The act of convening a Central Committee meeting indicates that
some basic agreement on economic policy has been reached. The
Chinese traditionally try to avoid open debate at such meetings and
keep arguments to informal settings.
   Officials have been arguing about a host of issues, including
how much control the central government should have over the
economy, how much revenue provinces should give the center and
whether state-set prices should be raised or freed from control.
   The economic arguments cloak a struggle over ideology and power.
China's power broker of the past decade, senior leader Deng
Xiaoping, has lost prestige since endorsing the army attack on
pro-democracy demonstrators last year, and his public appearances
and statements are rarer than ever.
   Li, asked at the airport if Deng still has final say over
important matters, answered ambiguously.
   ``We have successfully established a new generation of
leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus,'' he said,
referring to the party general secretary.
   ``This new leadership is entirely capaable of being responsible
for all affairs within China. Naturally, the thinking and writings
of Comrade Deng Xiaoping ... still have a positive influence on us
and are still useful to us.''
   He added that Deng, 86, is in good health. Unofficial reports
say Deng has suffered from cancer for several years, and rumors
have circulated recently that his health has become much worse. He
has not been seen in public since July and has turned down requests
for meetings by several prominent foreign visitors.
   Li also was asked if foreign observers will be allowed to attend
trials of prominent activists jailed since last year's crushed
democracy movement. The premier said only that the cases would be
handled ``according to legal procedures,'' and that government
policy was ``very lenient.''
   About a dozen leading participants in the democracy movement
were formally charged or had court hearings in the past month.
Trial dates have not been announced. Trials in China are not open
to the general public and foreigners are rarely allowed to attend.

<HEAD>Immigrant Finds Brother Who Survived Holocaust, 51 Years Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Half a century after fleeing to the Soviet
Union from Nazi-occupied in Poland, Yaacov Eichel immigrated to
Israel and was reunited with a younger brother who survived the
Holocaust without Eichel knowing.
   ``I'm in seventh heaven,'' a beaming Eichel, 66, said in Yiddish
on Israel television Monday.
   ``It is so surprising and dreamlike ... difficult to describe in
words,'' said brother Mordechai, 59, from northern Israel, who
Hebraized his family name to Allon.
   Eichel came from Tashkent three months ago. He said he went to
the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem after years of
unsuccessful attempts to track his family's whereabouts in the
Soviet Union and Poland.
   That's where he found a list of what happened to the Eichel
family that Allon filed in 1955 after he came to Israel. A Yad
Vashem archivist was able to locate Allon, and the two brothers met
this week in the West Bank settlement of Maale Adumim, the Yedioth
Ahronoth newspaper said.
   Allon said his brother fled their home in Warsaw in 1939 shortly
after the Germans invaded Poland.
   ``Mom saw there was a danger and he was already old enough so
she told him, run away and rescue yourself,'' Allon said.
   Eichel made it to an uncle's home in Tashkent and had some
contact with his family through letters until the Germans besieged
the Soviets.
   ``Since then I knew nothing of what happened to him,'' Allon
said. He said his parents and two other brothers were shoved with
the rest of the city's Jews into the Warsaw Ghetto.
   All but Allon either died in Nazi death camps and or were shot
dead by the Nazis in Warsaw. He had managed to find shelter with
Jewish partisans in Warsaw until the Russian Army liberated the
city in 1945.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Monday's auction to their lowest level in more
than two years.
   The Treasury Department sold $10.1 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 6.86 percent, down from 7.06 percent
last week. Another $10 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 6.74 percent, down from 6.96 percent last
week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 6.76
percent on July 18, 1988, and six-month bills averaged 6.71 percent
on July 5, 1988.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
- 7.08 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,826.60 and 7.07 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,659.30.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.24
percent last week from 7.30 percent the previous week.

   The Food and Drug Administration today
approved the first major new contraceptive in three decades - an
implant that protects women against pregnancy for up to five years.
   The device, called Norplant, consists of six matchstick-sized
silicone rubber capsules containing a hormone that is released
slowly over time.
   The capsules are implanted in the upper arm of a woman in a
minor surgical procedure that requires only local anesthesia.
Fertility is restored when the capsules are removed.
   The device is more than 99 percent effective, meaning that for
every 100 women who use it, at most one will become pregnant, says
the New York-based Population Council, which developed Norplant.
   It will be marketed by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of
Philadelphia.
   The device has been approved in 16 countries, where half a
million women have used it, according to the council.
   Many family planning experts consider Norplant to be the biggest
advance in birth control since oral contraceptives and the
intrauterine device, or IUD, were approved in the early 1960s.
   Norplant contains nothing new. The hormone, a synthetic
progestin, has been used safely for years, council officials say.
   Wyeth-Ayerst has not released price information for the product.

   Actress Helen Hayes, who isn't bashful about
her success on the stage and screen, says she wants her tombstone
to reflect her triumphs.
   Miss Hayes, 90, told the Hollywood Women's Press Club she wants
to take her epitaph from a line in a play she did about Queen
Victoria. In the play, a rough-looking man breaks through police
lines at Victoria's 90th birthday celebration and shouts, ``Go it,
old girl. You've done well.''
   ``I've always meant, since I (heard) that line, to have it put
on my tombstone,'' Miss Hayes said.
   Miss Hayes made the remark at the press club's Golden Apple
luncheon Sunday. She and actor Dennis Weaver received Louella O.
Parsons Awards, given in recognition to performers who project
outstanding images in the entertainment industry.
   ``I can't imagine why someone who was so briefly in film should
receive it, but I'm happy, and I'm not humble about it,'' Miss
Hayes said of the award. ``I feel proud as a lord and 10 feet
tall.''
   Patrick Swayze and Whoopi Goldberg, two stars of the hit film
``Ghost,'' received Golden Apples as the male and female star of
the year. The group's Sour Apple trophy went to Zsa Zsa Gabor.

<HEAD>Pakistan Completes Census; Population Could Double By 2020</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan completed a nationwide
census on Monday, and analysts say the new right-wing government
has little time to find a way to cope with the nation's soaring
birthrate.
   Conservative estimates put Pakistan's current population at
about 120 million, almost 40 million more than in 1980.
   At that rate, family planning experts say, the population will
double by the year 2020.
   This was the first census in a decade in Pakistan, one of the
world's fastest-growing countries. Census takers had been going
from tents to dried-mud houses to palatial mansions since Nov. 22.
   By the time the results are released in about six months,
hundreds of thousands of children will have been born. The
burgeoning population threatens to devour the country's already
meager resources.
   Pakistan, a predominantly Moslem nation, produces a child every
eight seconds. Observers say that kind of growth could lead to
economic collapse.
   ``If they don't deal with this soon, they'll be facing a
disaster in five to 10 years. It's a nightmare that nobody wants,''
said one Western diplomat, who asked not to be identified.
   Pakistan's birthrate stands at 3.2 percent, well ahead of the 2
percent in India, its neighbor to the east. So far, there is little
evidence the new government is eager to embark on an ambitious
family planning program.
   The Social Services ministry, responsible for encouraging small
families in Pakistan, is headed by a fundamentalist Moslem, Saddar
Niazi, who boasts of being one of 15 children.
   He said the pressure for family planning is a holdover from the
liberal secularism of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was
ousted Aug. 6 on charges of corruption and ineffectiveness, and
overwhelmingly defeated in national elections three months later.
   Most Pakistani women have an average of six to seven children,
the highest fertility rate in Asia, and only 11 percent of couples
of childbearing age use contraceptives.
   Most rural women are veiled at puberty and bartered into
marriage as early as 15. Most women have at least four living
children by the time they turn 30. Almost as many would have died
at childbirth or before the age of five.
   Proponents of family planning struggle against conservative
views of Islamic clerics. When women consider birth control, they
are often chastised for defying what is called God's grand design.
   The National Institute of Population Studies has warned that
even if Pakistan became a nation of two-child families, the
population would grow to 160 million in the next several decades.
   Just to keep the current standard of living, ``we must double
all our infrastructure, hospitals, schools, housing, food
production, water resources and factories,'' said spokesman
Mohammad Sheikh.
   Pakistan's infrastructure is dilapidated. Health care is
inadequate and available only in the cities and towns.
   Khurshed Ahmed, a senator and member of the ultra-orthodox
Jamaat-i-Islami, or Party of God, said there was no need for family
planning. Education and affluence would check population growth, he
said.
   But Pakistan is desperately short of schools.
   More than 52 percent of Pakistan's budget is spent on defense
and a meager 4 percent on education. Less than 17 percent of the
population as a whole can read or write, and the percentage is far
smaller for women.

<HEAD>Former Customs Commissioner Testifies in Defense of DeConcini</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former customs commissioner testified in
defense of Sen. Dennis DeConcini today, telling the Senate Ethics
Committee that intervention with government agencies is proper and
not limited by ethical standards.
   ``Whatever approach a senator took, so long as it was not
unlawful, was acceptable to me,'' said William von Raab,
commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service during the Reagan
administration.
   But von Raab also acknowledged he had never faced pressure from
senators under the same circumstances DeConcini and other senators
are accused of applying.
   ``There were massive interventions'' by members of Congress
seeking changes in regulations or waivers for specific constituents
when he was in office, he said.
   ``It was standard operating procedure,'' von Raab, a Republican,
told DeConcini's lawyer, James Hamilton.
   Von Raab testified during the 15th day of the ethic panel's
hearings into allegations that DeConcini, D-Ariz., and four other
senators improperly intervened with S&amp;L regulators on behalf of
Charles H. Keating Jr., who contributed $1.3 million to their
campaigns and favored causes.
   Von Raab said that not only was it common for members of
Congress to meet privately with regulators on behalf of
constituents, it also was common for them to do so even when
regulators had referred the case to the Justice Department for
criminal investigation.
   But under cross-examination by the committee's special counsel,
Robert S. Bennett, he said he had no direct knowledge of the
senators' efforts for Keating - and that he hadn't faced the same
kind of intervention the senators are accused of applying.
   DeConcini faces accusations by witnesses that he tried to
negotiate a deal on behalf of Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan
and continued to press regulators after being told of potential
criminal activity at the thrift.
   Von Raab said he sometimes refused to make changes DeConcini
wanted, and in one case DeConcini's position was upheld in the
courts.
   ``Sen. DeConcini was always firm, resolute, but always fair,''
he said.
   Later, a former tax accountant for Keating's company, American
Continental Corp., testified about flights Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., and his family took on the company's aircraft.
   David Stevens estimated the value of the flights by McCain, his
wife Cindy, their child and a babysitter, going back to 1984, at
$16,870.46. McCain repaid two of the flights at the time and more
in 1989, when the Internal Revenue Service examined the company's
books.
   Stevens said in a letter to the committee that he ``never saw
any evidence that he (McCain) originally inended to reimburse for
the costs of his wife and babysitter.'' But he said under
questioning he did not know McCain's intent and regretted the
conclusions in his letter.
   Stevens said that after he wrote offering his testimony,
DeConcini called to request he sign an affidavit. In their call, he
said, DeConcini complained that McCain had received more favorable
treatment than he had from ethics investigator and wanted Stevens'
testimony to show that only a one-sided case had been presented.
   Other witnesses testified in DeConcini's defense, describing
help he provided for law enforcement, drug-treatment projects and
disabled veterans. They said he acted without regard to campaign
contributions.
   ``I could not imagine how he could have done anything more,''
said Rod Mullin, who runs an assistance program for the poor.
   Evidence presented so far has been particularly damaging for the
two senators seen as in the worst trouble, Democrats Alan Cranston
of California and DeConcini.
   None of the senators could have liked the description that
witness William K. Black offered last week of their April 1987
meeting with federal regulators. The senators were told of Lincoln
S&amp;L's reckless and potentially criminal practices.
   ``This is an institution that is probably the worst institution
in America,'' Black recounted. ``And instead of trying to help
bring it under control, five U.S. senators were pushing us in the
opposite direction. It was startlingly the wrong direction.''
   The other three senators are Democrats John Glenn of Ohio and
Donald Riegle of Michigan and Republican John McCain of Arizona.
   All sides are awaiting the testimony of James Grogan, a former
top aide and lobbyist for Keating. He has been given limited
immunity from prosecution for his testimony, which will be given in
private Dec. 17 and in public later.
   Federal regulators, and even one of DeConcini's own aides, have
described him as pressing on to help his friend and contributor,
Keating, despite strong warnings.
   Laurie A. Sedlmayr, DeConcini's aide on banking issues,
testified she didn't like Keating and warned her boss that it would
be a ``political mistake'' to go to a critical April 2, 1987,
meeting on Lincoln that four of the senators held with top
regulator Edwin J. Gray.
   DeConcini ``thanked me for my suggestion and said he was going
to go ahead anyway,'' she said.
   Gray, the former Reagan administration thrift regulator,
repeated his allegations that DeConcini offered a deal in that
April 2 meeting. The meeting itself was improper, he said, because
he felt pressured by the senators on behalf of one institution.
   Michael Patriarca and Black, both San Francisco-based
regulators, described DeConcini as offering a deal on Lincoln and
said none of the other senators dissented or distanced themselves
from the offer.
   Black contended that pressure from the senators led to the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board's May 1988 decision to ease off new
regulatory controls proposed for Lincoln.
   The bank board revised its hard-line policy after Cranston aide
Carolyn Jordan called to express displeasure. Her call had been set
in motion by a call from Grogan, Keating's lobbyist, complaining
about the bank board's action.
   The result of the board's change was that the eventual takeover
of Lincoln was delayed and the cost of the taxpayers' bailout of
insured deposits was increased, Black said. And, he said, it meant
Lincoln was able to sell more uninsured junk bonds to people - many
of them elderly - who became victims of Lincoln's collapse.
   Keating faces fraud charges in California stemming from the sale
of those junk bonds.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel appealed to
Parliament on Monday for new powers to keep Czechoslovakia from
splitting in two as it wrestles with vestiges of Communist rule.
   The former dissident and playwright, who became president in
Czechoslovakia's revolution last year, has preferred to govern with
moral authority.
   But he said he was forced to act because a dispute over division
of powers between the federal government and the Czech and Slovak
republics threatens the country's future.
   ``I am very sorry I had to go this far,'' Havel said in an
emergency speech, broadcast live on national TV. ``I am doing this
to fulfill the expectations of millions of citizens who ...
entrusted this position to me and believe I will help save our
federation.''
   Slovak leaders are said to be ready to declare the sovereignty
of their laws on Slovak territory unless the federal Parliament
approves a division of powers that they find acceptable.
   The state news agency CTK quoted Deputy Premier Pavel Rychetsky
as saying Havel should be given power to ask for a non-partisan
government of experts in times of crisis, to rule by decree if
Parliament has been dissolved and to veto legislation.
   Havel currently has the power to sign treaties, command the
armed forces, appoint the federal government, summon and dissolve
parliament, sign its laws, grant amnesties or other legal pardons
and declare war.
   His extraordinary powers, if granted, would be in effect until a
new constitution is approved. That is to take place in the next 18
months.
   Initial Slovak reaction to Havel's speech ranged from no comment
from top leaders to criticism from Christian Democrats, one of
three members of the governing coalition in Slovakia.
   ``I disagree with strengthening the presidential position to
delegate law-making powers to the president,'' said Jan Petrik, the
executive secretary of the Christian Democratic Movement.
   ``I cannot agree with the concentration of uncontrollable power
in the hands of the president,'' Petrik said in the Slovak capital,
Bratislava.
   The CTK news agency quoted Slovak deputy Anton Andras as saying,
``I consider the proposal to give broader powers to the president
unfortunate and unsuitable. We have had this before.''
   Andras, until recently Slovak interior minister, was alluding to
the authoritarian Communist rule.
   Czechoslovakia formally became a federation in 1968. But
hard-line Communist rule meant Slovaks felt controlled by Prague,
the Czech and federal capital. Czechs meanwhile resented the
allocation of half the country's resources to just one third of its
people, the approximately 5 million Slovaks.
   Czechoslovakia is embarking on an ambitious reform program in
which the state-owned economy will be turned over to private hands.
But Western leaders repeatedly have warned that political
instability will hamper the foreign investment and aid that the
economy badly needs.
   A law dividing powers among the federal government and the two
republics was to be debated by Parliament on Tuesday, when Havel
was scheduled to leave on a visit to Spain and Portugal.
   The bill on presidential powers was to be debated later. That
leaves the issue of strong new presidential powers hanging over
deputies while they discuss dividing government functions.
   The Czech and Slovak parliaments differ over control of oil and
gas pipelines, taxation and budget questions, postal services,
control over policy toward ethnic minorities and chairmanship of
the national bank.
   An agreement forged last month between the Czech, Slovak and
federal governments keeps foreign policy, defense, general economic
and monetary policy under federal control.
   To prolonged applause from Parliament, Havel stressed that
sovereignty of Slovak law on Slovak territory would be
unconstitutional. The federal Parliament's decisions should be
binding ``on all institutions and on all people,'' he said.
   Otherwise, ``the thin ice of our constitution will be broken and
our state would inevitably fall into legal chaos,'' he said.

   The Postal Service should rescind a decision
to reduce delivery standards for some mail, a report prepared for
Congress said Monday.
   The post office cut back some overnight delivery areas in July,
saying the changes would save money and improve efficiency. The
agency said the changes would slow delivery of only about 5 percent
of first-class mail.
   The change could slow delivery of as many as 4.3 billion pieces
of mail over a year, according to the General Accounting Office
report ``Just Say Slow.''
   In 1989, the post office carried 85.8 billion pieces of
first-class mail. Five percent of that would be 4.3 billion.
   The report charged that the Postal Service implemented the
change without demonstrating that it would lead to any improvement
for the public.
   ``Our investigation indicates that many customers - especially
those in rural America - will suffer because of the new
standards,'' Rep. Bob Wise, D-W. Va., said in a statement.
   Wise is chairman of the government information subcommittee of
the House Government Operations Committee, which released the
report.
   The independent Postal Rate Commission has also criticized the
change in delivery standards.
   The changes primarily affect areas where mail standards had
called for overnight or second-day delivery, but the post office
had performed poorly in meeting those goals.
   In general, for example, a pair of cities with relatively low
volume might have been shifted from overnight to second-day
delivery or from second to third-day delivery in the change.
   Postal officials had no immediate response to the report.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela has accepted an
invitation to join political, business and church leaders on a tour
of violence-plagued black townships, the African National Congress
said Monday.
   There was no word on whether rival Inkatha leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi would take part in Wednesday's tour organized by the
anti-apartheid South African Council of Churches. Buthelezi said
Sunday he had not received an invitation.
   Police said 27 people died in violence throughout the country
over the weekend and on Monday, including 13 in the Tokoza township
south of Johannesburg. Wednesday's tour would include a stop in
Tokoza.
   Two Inkatha supporters were shot to death and eight seriously
wounded early Monday when a taxi they were riding in was ambushed
by gunfire in eastern Natal Province, the independent South African
Press Association reported.
   The report said the unidentified attackers used AK-47 assault
rifles.
   An Inkatha official on Monday accused police of instigating
attacks on Inkatha members in Tokoza over the weekend. There was no
immediate government response, but police and the government have
repeatedly denied similar charges by the ANC.
   Mandela and President F.W. de Klerk announced Sunday they had
held secret meetings in the last week to discuss the violence. The
brief joint statement said progress had been made and further talks
would be held, but it provided no details of other steps to be
taken.
   Supporters of the Zulu-dominated Inkatha Freedom Party have been
fighting Xhosas and other blacks loyal to the ANC for five years in
Natal, leaving more than 5,000 people dead.
   The virtual warfare spread to townships near Johannesburg in
August, killing about 1,000 people.
   Both Mandela and Buthelezi have called for the violence to end,
but their supporters have continued fighting.
   Buthelezi has called for a one-on-one meeting with Mandela,
saying they are the only leaders with the power to halt the
violence.
   But the ANC has rejected the idea. It blames Buthelezi for
instigating the violence in a bid to gain legitimacy outside of
Natal, the traditional Zulu homeland.
   Mandela attended a summit of black leaders convened last month
by Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, but Buthelezi turned down the
invitation. He said such a meeting would waste time unless the ANC
and Inkatha first cleared up their differences.
   A meeting between the leadership of the two black opposition
groups, including Mandela and Buthelezi, also had been planned, but
was postponed indefinitely. The ANC said scheduling problems caused
the postponement.
   On Sunday, an Inkatha congress called for the ANC to work with
other anti-apartheid groups in seeking an end to violence and a
quick start of negotiations with the white-led government on ending
apartheid.
   De Klerk has pledged to end apartheid and negotiate a new
constitution with all parties that would give political power to
the black majority.
   The ANC and the government have held peace talks since May on
setting up the full-scale negotiations, expected to begin next
year. But the violence has strained relations between them, with
the ANC repeatedly accusing security forces of fueling the violence
and siding with Inkatha.
   An official of the militant Pan Africanist Congress said Monday
his group and the ANC would meet soon to discuss forming a unified
front to fight apartheid.
   But the PAC on Sunday rejected an invitation to join the planned
negotiations with the government on a new constitution, saying only
a freely elected constituent assembly had the power to draft a
constitution.

   Rep. Stephen Solarz on Monday announced the
formation of a diverse group of government, academic and labor
leaders that will seek to push President Bush to take a harder line
in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The liberal New York Democrat, who has acknowledged worries that
his party may suffer long-term political damage if it is seen as
being too soft on Iraq, said he hoped to counter congressional
critics who say Bush seems too eager to use military force against
Saddam Hussein.
   The group, the Committee for Peace and Security in the Gulf,
issued a statement endorsing the threat of military force as an
essential part of a strategy that also includes economic sanctions
and diplomatic isolation.
   It also sought to focus attention on Saddam's arsenal of
conventional, chemical and biological weapons, and on his efforts
to build a nuclear bomb.
   In addition to forcing Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, ``We
believe that we must also find ways to remove Saddam Hussein's
capacity to wage aggression,'' the group said. The threat requires
that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction ``be verifiably dismantled,
or if necessary destroyed,'' it said.
   A Solarz spokesman, Bob Hathaway, said while the administration
has spoken vaguely of a need for ``security in the region'' once
the immediate crisis is resolved, the committee ``thinks it's
necessary for the administration to go further by directly
confronting this issue.''
   The committee hopes to take out newspaper ads and hold seminars
in Washington and around the country on topics like military
options in the gulf and the usefulness of economic sanctions. It
also hopes to sponsor speaking tours for group members.
   The group includes figures as diverse as former Democratic Party
political director Ann Lewis and Reagan administration Pentagon
official Richard Perle, its two co-directors. In addition to
Solarz, the group includes senators Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and John
McCain, R-Ariz., and Reps. Tom Lantos, D-Calif.; Dave McCurdy,
D-Okla.; John Murtha, D-Pa., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
   ``It's a tribute to Saddam Hussein's power to bring people
together,'' joked Perle, who said Solarz began forming the group
about six weeks ago.
   ``We were concerned about where things were headed,'' said
Perle, who now is a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a
conservative think tank.

<HEAD>Declaration Drafted to End Superpower Involvement in Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A declaration providing a face-saving
superpower exit from the Afghanistan conflict has been drafted by
U.S. and Soviet officials and could be released this week,
diplomatic sources said Monday.
   The three-point document is deliberately vague and would let the
Afghans decide how to settle the 12-year-old war, said the sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The declaration falls far short of bringing an end to the
conflict, they said. But pressure has been increasing for both
sides to clear Afghanistan from the superpower agenda before the
Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   The document could be released during the current talks between
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze in Houston, the sources said.
   Washington's special envoy to the Afghan resistance, Peter
Tomsen, was expected in Pakistan on Tuesday. He was prepared to
explain any superpower announcement to the Afghan guerrillas, who
have been trying since 1978 to overthrow the Soviet-supported
government in Kabul, the sources said.
   ``We anticipate an announcement,'' one diplomat said, speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``It's been in the cards for some time.
It may or may not happen this time. We're poised but it could be
another false alarm.''
   The announcement had been expected during last month's
Baker-Shevardnadze talks in Geneva but was delayed by differences
over how to cut off weapons to both warring sides, they said.
   The Soviet Union sent about 115,000 troops into Afghanistan in
December 1979 to prop up successive Communist governments trying to
impose radical reforms on the largely rural Moslem population.
   After the Red Army's pullout in February 1989, Moscow continued
to pour an estimated $2 billion to $3 billion annually in weapons
and supplies to support troops loyal to President Najibullah.
   Western diplomats and guerrilla leaders once confidently
measured the survival of Najibullah's government in weeks and
months. But the guerrillas were unable to switch from their
hit-and-run tactics to conventional warfare and were rendered
helpless against the well-equipped and well-trained Afghan air
force.
   Within months of the Soviet withdrawal, the anticipated
guerrilla victory became a costly military stalemate that failed to
produce a clear victory for either side.
   With the guerrillas controlling the countryside and Najibullah's
troops holding the cities, the superpowers began searching for
diplomatic formulas to extricate themselves from a war that has
left more than 1.5 million people dead and sent nearly 6 million
Afghans into exile in Pakistan and Iran.
   Diplomatic sources say the draft declaration is purposely vague
and advocates no concrete peace plan for the Afghans, fiercely
independent tribal people who throughout history have resisted,
often violently, the tutelage of outsiders.

   When the social club run by hard-boiled reputed
mobster Venero ``Benny Eggs'' Mangano was evicted, the mob's
cobblers resisted any urge to fit the landlord for concrete shoes.
   Instead, the Greenwich Village neighborhood was covered with
posters, banners and petitions in an unsuccessful campaign to
``Keep the Club.''
   Non-violence failed to sway landlord Martin Herzog, a brave and
thrifty soul who claims an art gallery or boutique will pay $3,500
a month for the storefront that Mangano rented for $250.
   ``I've known Benny Eggs and the rest of those guys for 25
years,'' Herzog said. ``I'm not afraid of them. I'm only afraid of
God.''
   Law enforcers describe Mangano, a short, bald 69-year-old, as
No. 2 man in the Genovese crime family, the nation's second
largest.
   The nameless club at 101 Thompson St. was frequented by old men
from the neighborhood, who would chat, play cards or sip a drink at
the tables inside. When the weather was warm, they'd hang out on
the sidewalk. No one claims all or even most of them were
criminals, and their presence comforted residents worried about
street crime.
   Benny Eggs also met business associates at the club, but in
recent years he had done most of his talking while strolling around
the block, said a federal prosecutor who spoke on condition he not
be identified.
   Before the eviction, posters appeared around the neighborhood.
``So far we have been able to keep hard drugs off the street. When
we move, the drug dealers and criminals will know,'' they warned.
``Keep the Club!'' proclaimed a banner unfurled from a fire escape
on the front of the building.
   Several young occupants of the apartments above the club, people
who did not grow up in the neighborhood but valued the club as a
hedge against crime, carried petitions door to door and collected
hundreds of signatures.
   After the eviction took effect the end of October, a new set of
posters appeared: ``Mr. Herzog promised we could stay as long as he
controlled the building. Now he's evicted us. Call his lawyer and
tell him you will not patronize any new business here.''
   Herzog says that when he purchased the building four years ago
he shook hands with Mangano and told him to expect a rent increase.
He says he began eviction proceedings when Mangano refused to pay
more.
   For Benny Eggs, the struggle over the club became academic.
   He was arrested earlier this year with seven co-defendants on
charges of conspiring to rig bids on city window replacement
contracts. Pending his trial, he is confined to his home with an
electronic monitor to verify his presence.
   Initially, Mangano was allowed to spend weekends at the
seashore, but a judge revoked that privilege after his accuser's
wife found a bomb in the front seat of her car.
   Tony Dapolito, whose family has run an Italian bakery in the
neighborhood of the club for 70 years, says many law-abiding
citizens were sad to see it go.
   ``People felt they threw those poor old men out,'' he said.
``With the club, they had a place to go. The nearest senior center
is 10 blocks away, and the K of C (Knights of Columbus) is five
blocks.''
   ``These clubs used to be all over the city, and they're what
made the streets safe,'' he added. ``I'm not condoning all of them,
but most of them were pretty decent places.''
   Herzog does not share his nostalgia. ``This area's been a slum
long enough,'' he said. He called Benny Eggs and company
``parasites,'' and asked: ``Why don't they go play pinochle in
their rent-controlled apartments?''

   President Bush kept a full schedule Monday
despite being slowed by what he called ``a touch of the flu.''
   Bush, who spent last week in South America, told reporters that
he ``shouldn't have played tennis yesterday. Got out there and did
that and then - WHAM!''
   Asked what the connection was between flu and tennis, Bush
replied: ``Well, I don't know. I think I was tired.''
   Bush skipped a Christmas gala Sunday night, but he was to be the
host of a Monday night ball at the White House for members of
Congress.

<HEAD>Head of Co-Op Lending Program Says Some Borrowers Are In Trouble</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the federal agency that has loaned
billions of dollars to America's rural electric cooperatives
acknowledged Monday that some of the borrowers are having trouble
repaying their low-interest loans.
   Gary C. Byrne, who has headed the Rural Electrification
Administration since March, also said the agency's lending program
must be tightened to make it more responsible.
   ``We have some difficult credit situations,'' Byrne told a small
group of reporters in his first meeting with the press. However, he
added, ``I'm reasonably confident that we're through the worst of
the credit problems.''
   Eight rural electric cooperatives currently are in default on
$2.3 billion in loans from the REA; four of the eight are in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. The eight also owe $1.25
billion to private creditors.
   Only a few of the nation's nearly 1,000 electric co-ops are in
serious trouble, but the money problems have made some experts
fearful of the REA's financial health. Nearly all the co-ops
nationwide have received low-interest federal loans or federal
guarantees for bank loans.
   The financial troubles gripping some electric co-ops and their
potential impact on the federal loan program were disclosed in an
article by The Associated Press.
   Byrne, the first banker to be appointed REA administrator, said
the outlook for co-ops will depend on the health of the economy and
on the weather. If the economy is weak or the weather is warmer
than usual this winter, he said, demand for electricity - and
consequently the co-ops' revenue - would decrease.
   Byrne said the REA has adopted a strategy that includes steering
financially healthy co-ops toward the private market for their
loans and weaning them away from federal aid. The agency plans to
reduce the number of low-interest loans it grants and replace them
with loan guarantees.
   In addition, he said, the REA needs to revise its lending
policies to better distinguish between the co-ops with the greatest
financial need and those less in need of federal funds.
   The new approach ``does assure the American taxpayers that if
the money is loaned out, that money will be returned,'' Byrne said.
   The rural electrification program, set up in the mid-1930s,
radically changed U.S. agriculture by providing the cheap electric
power that enabled farmers to modernize. But critics complain that
the program no longer serves a useful purpose and is a waste of
taxpayers' money.
   The Bush administration, looking for ways to reduce the swelling
federal budget deficit, has mounted a quiet attack on the REA
subsidies. The Office of Management and Budget, in a recent memo to
the Energy Department, proposed phasing out all REA subsidies over
ten years.
   ``I think we're going to be battling for funds over the next
several years,'' Byrne said. ``You keep the program strong by
making the program financially responsible.''
   The biggest losses have been posted by big cooperatives that
generate their own electricity. Most of the smaller co-ops - which
are members of the generating co-ops and only distribute
electricity - are in sound financial shape.
   The REA has proposed new administrative rules that would, among
other things, require the smaller distribution co-ops to guarantee
loans made to their parent cooperatives.
   Byrne, who was appointed by President Bush to a 10-year term,
formerly was chairman of the Bank of Alex Brown in Sacramento,
Calif. Prior to his appointment, REA administrators had come from a
farming or ranching background.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail Gorbachev told Communist Party
leaders Monday they have nothing to fear from his Union Treaty
proposal to drop the word ``socialist'' from the country's name and
replace it with ``sovereign.''
   The treaty plan contains ``strong expressions of the ideas and
principles we connect with socialism - its humanistic, democratic
nature,'' Gorbachev assured the party's embattled Central Committee
during a closed-door session.
   Gorbachev, who is also head of the the Communist Party, urged
party leaders to create a ``strong political desire for the
preservation and renewal of the union.''
   ``What is profitable for separatists is absolutely fatal for the
majority of workers,'' Gorbachev said. The party meeting was closed
to journalists, and a text of his speech was carried later by the
state news agency Tass.
   Several of the 15 republics already have dropped ``Soviet
Socialist'' from their names as a rejection of decades of Soviet
communism.
   Last week, hard-line members of the national legislature
demanded Gorbachev suspend steps toward democratic reforms as a way
to hold the union together. They suggested Gorbachev be replaced if
he does not take action.
   Some European leaders also have expressed fears that civil
strife could send millions of Soviets fleeing across international
borders.
   Gorbachev's draft treaty, which would replace a 1922 document,
envisions changing the country's name from ``Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics'' to ``Union of Sovereign Soviet Republics.''
   Gorbachev said his proposal is a government document, not the
statement of a political party.
   ``Will there be a union of strong sovereign states or a
crumbling symbolic formation?'' Gorbachev asked the policy-making
Central Committee, leaders of the 17 million-member party that has
been steadily losing members and authority.
   The draft treaty never mentions the words ``socialism'' or
``communism.'' It divides powers between the central government and
the republics, and says ``economic development strategy'' will be
determined jointly.
   It would give more economic power to the republics, while
retaining Kremlin control over the military, foreign policy,
transportation, energy and other key industries.
   Six republics already have said they will not sign and demanded
Kremlin endorsement of their sovereignty declarations.
   All the Soviet republics except Kirgizia in central Asia have
declared some form of autonomy or independence. Lawmakers in
Kirgizia had sovereignty on their agenda as they opened a session
Monday.
   Kirgizia's legislative speaker, Absamat Masaliev, resigned
Monday in order to concentrate on duties as a Communist Party
official, Tass reported. It was unclear whether Masaliev's
resignation was connected to the republic's sovereignty debate.
   In Moscow, Gorbachev also blasted the ``war of laws'' in which
national and republic lawmakers have passed conflicting
legislation, paralyzing the economy. He has said the treaty is
needed to stave off economic collapse.
   ``If patches of land, divided by customs barriers, independent
currencies or even border guards form in place of an all-union
market, vast opportunities will be lost,'' he said.
   Gorbachev reiterated his insistence that no republic can secede
without a referendum.
   Gorbachev also rejected proposals to adopt new constitutions in
each republic before signing the Union Treaty. He said
inter-republic agreements are acceptable only if they do not
supplant the Union Treaty. Nearly a dozen such bilateral treaties
have been signed.
   Earlier Monday, Tass said rumors that Gorbachev will step down
as Communist Party chief are ``totally unfounded.'' Such rumors
have been circulating for a year.

   A beaming Barbara Bush showed off the White
House Christmas decorations Monday, from a towering tree garlanded
with Nutcracker dolls and ballet slippers to a gingerbread house
guarded by a miniature Millie.
   ``It's ravishing,'' exclaimed the first lady as she led a
preview tour of the White House, brimming with garlands, bows,
poinsettias, 47 trees, 54,000 lights and even a sprig of mistletoe
above the Grand Staircase.
   An estimated 100,000 visitors will troop through the mansion to
view the finery over the holiday season.
   President Bush complained Monday of having ``a touch of the
flu,'' but he was host of a congressional ball for 700 guests
Monday night. The Bushes planned seven other Christmas parties over
the next 10 days.
   Mrs. Bush had seen most of the decorations as they went up over
the weekend, with the help of 40 volunteers from the florist
industry and White House staff. Several grandchildren helped pelt
the trees with artificial snow.
   But she got her first glimpse of White House Executive Chef Hans
Raffert's gingerbread house, dressed up as the witch's cottage from
Hansel and Gretel. The wayward children are in the front yard,
along with the witch, a snowman and, stretched out in front of her
own doghouse, Millie.
   ``It's just beautiful, Hans. Absolutely spectacular,'' Mrs. Bush
told the chef, who has created gingerbread houses each Christmas
for the past 21 years. ``Prettier than ever.''
   The Nutcracker ballet provided the theme this year, with the
official 18{-foot high Fraser fir tree in the Blue Room festooned
with porcelain dolls and beaded ballet slippers.
   Mrs. Bush credited the White House staff with the handiwork,
including doll's costumes made from scratch. Giant toy soldiers are
posted along the room's walls.
   ``Everybody in the White House had a part - the carpenters, the
electricians, everybody,'' she said, including a plumber who
constructed a castle from plastic pipes.
   An 18th century Italian wood and terra cotta nativity scene is
prominently displayed in the East Room, as it has been every
Christmas since 1967.
   Mrs. Bush also gave reporters a glimpse of the Bush's personal
Christmas tree, upstairs in their private quarters in the Yellow
Oval Room. The tree, a 16-foot Fraser fir, overlooks the Truman
Balcony in the center of the mansion.
   It is filled with the family's own decorations, including a
crocheted snowman that she and her eldest son, George, made years
ago. Mrs. Bush also spotted a wooden rabbit nestled in grass, the
last survivor from a set of 10 that her mother gave her in 1945,
the year they were married.
   The first lady said there was only one thing that she or the
president wanted this Christmas: ``Peace.''
   Asked about Pentagon restrictions on Christmas celebrations for
the U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, Mrs. Bush said, ``It's too bad.
But you know, when in Rome, I guess you have to do what the Romans
do.'' But she said nothing can stop them from celebrating the
holiday in their hearts.
   Pressed on what other gifts would be under the Bush tree, the
first lady said, ``I have way too much in life, as does George
Bush.'' But she said, ``I'm giving him something he needs.''
   The Bushes will spend Christmas at Camp David, the presidential
retreat in Maryland, with their children and grandchildren.

<HEAD>Reputed Mob Chief Says Government Bugs Violated First Amendment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The reputed chief of organized crime in
New England claims the First Amendment right of free speech and
association should bar the government from using tapes of a
purported Mafia induction ceremony.
   Raymond J. ``Junior'' Patriarca does not admit that the Mafia or
La Cosa Nostra exists. But if it does, he argues, a secret
induction ceremony is ``clearly protected ... by the First
Amendment from governmental intrusion.''
   Patriarca, 46, of Lincoln, outlined his defense in pretrial
motions filed last week in U.S. District Court in Boston, The
Providence Journal-Bulletin reported Monday.
   He noted that the amendment applies to the Ku Klux Klan and the
Nazi Party, which are ``far more heinous yet unquestionably
protected organizations.''
   He is trying to block introduction of six hours of tape
recordings that agents made of a meeting on Oct. 29, 1989, at a
house in Medford, Mass. The government alleges that at the meeting
four new members took a blood oath to kill anyone who violated the
organization's secrecy.
   Patriarca has been in prison since his March indictment on
charges of racketeering, conspiracy and interstate travel in aid of
racketeering. He is accused of organized crime violations along
with 21 other alleged members and associates of the purported
Patriarca crime family in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode
Island.
   Until Patriarca submitted numerous court motions last week
seeking to quash the charges and the evidence, there had been
speculation he was trying to work out a plea agreement.
   He also challenged the warrant that allowed the bugging of the
meeting, and says the tapes should not be used against him because
the government didn't mention him as a target of the bugging in the
warrant.
   Floyd Abrams, a noted First Amendment attorney from New York,
said Patriarca's argument ``is not without its charm.'' But he said
the right of speech and association never had been allowed to
shield criminal conduct.
   ``It is one thing for him to argue, `There is no Cosa Nostra and
if it exists, I'm not in it,' and it's another to say if it exists
it's just a private social club,'' Abrams said.
   Vincent Blasi, a professor of First Amendment law at Columbia
University, agreed that the constitutional protection doesn't apply
when the government has a reasonable basis to believe that
intercepted conversations will reveal crimes.
   The government has until Dec. 31 to respond.

<HEAD>Couple Operates Retirement Farm for Horses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALACHUA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A stable of played-out polo ponies,
run-down racehorses and pleasure steeds too old for fun have found
a patch of heaven at Mill Creek Farm, where they are never ridden,
saddled or worked.
   The 24 horses now living on the farm literally have been put out
to pasture. All they have to do as long as they live is to eat from
ample supplies of forage and grain and socialize with each other.
   ``We feel like there is a need for a place like this,'' said
Peter Gregory, who operates the Retirement Home for Horses Inc.
near this community northwest of Gainesville in northern Florida.
   Many horse owners cannot or do not want to keep their horses
after the animals get older and they end up being destroyed,
Gregory said.
   He and his wife, Mary, take in horses from people and
institutions who have heard about them from word of mouth. They
rely on voluntary contributions, but pay much of the the minimum
$40-a-month cost of caring for each horse themselves.
   ``In a small way, we are trying to make up for the things that
have happened to them,'' he said.
   The Gregorys took on the work in their own retirement, buying
the 140 acres of rolling pasture and woodland about seven years
ago. They formed a nonprofit corporation with tax-exempt,
charitable-institution status that they hope will enable the farm
to take in horses for years to come.

<HEAD>Grand Jury This Week May Take Up 1963 Slaying of Civil Rights
Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury meets this week and may
decide whether a suspect should again face charges in the 1963
ambush slaying of civil rights leader Medgar Evers.
   ``All I can say is there is speculation the case will be
presented'' the week of Dec. 10, Myrlie Evers, widow of Medgar
Evers, said in a recent telephone interview with reporters from her
home in Los Angeles. She said she hoped to be in Mississippi in
case she is needed to testify.
   District Attorney Ed Peters declined to comment when asked if
the Byron De La Beckwith case would be considered by the Hinds
County jury.
   Evers was field secretary of the Mississippi NAACP when he was
shot to death June 12, 1963, in the driveway of his Jackson home.
Authorities said a high-powered rifle bearing Beckwith's
fingerprint was found nearby. Beckwith, at the time a Greenwood
fertilizer salesman, said the weapon had been stolen.
   Two all-white juries were unable to reach verdicts in February
and April 1964 and mistrials were declared. The murder charge was
dismissed against Beckwith in 1969.
   Beckwith, 70, who now lives in Signal Mountain, Tenn., remains
an ardent segregationist but says he is innocent. ``It's amazing
they'd wait 27 years to convene a grand jury,'' he said last week.
   Assistant District Attorney Bobby DeLaughter confirmed that he
has spent the past 14 months investigating the Evers slaying.
Initially the investigation centered on possible jury tampering
after published reports that the old state Sovereignty Commission,
a now-defunct segregation watchdog agency, collected information
about potential jurors in Beckwith's second trial.
   A different grand jury met in December 1989 but found no
evidence of jury tampering. That panel asked for more investigation
into the prospects of reopening a murder prosecution, DeLaughter
said.

   The 19th game of the world chess
championship was postponed Monday for two days at the request of
Anatoly Karpov, who trails reigning champion Garry Kasparov 9.5-8.5
in the series.
   With Karpov's loss Sunday to Kasparov, who moved ahead of Karpov
for the third time in the championship match, only a maximum of six
games remain to be played.
   The first player to gain 12.5 points (victories count for a
point, ties for a half-point) wins the championship and $1.7
million of a $3 million purse. In the event of a tie, Kasparov
retains his title.
   The series began Oct. 8 in New York and Kasparov won the second
and 16th games, with Karpov evening the score with wins in the
seventh and 17th games.
   All the other games have been draws.
   The first 12 games in the series were played in New York. The
13th game started in Lyon on Nov. 24.

<HEAD>Czech Bud Stops Flowing in Strike Over Trademark Beer</HEAD>

   The only thing brewing at the
original Budweiser on Monday was trouble.
   Beer stopped flowing when the Czech braumeisters went on strike
Monday in a brew-haha over merging with the makers of America's
version of the famous fermented beverage.
   Budvar brewery in the southern Bohemian town of Ceske
Budejovice, known as Budweis in German, has brewed its namesake
beer since it was founded in the 19th century.
   Early in this century, Bavarian-born Adolphus Busch acquired the
rights to sell ``Budweiser'' in North America.
   Budvar maintained the trademark rights for Europe, with exports
on the Continent worth $8 million in 1989.
   Now, after a failed attempt under Communist rule in 1988,
attempts are under way to reunite the two Budweisers.
   Anheuser Busch tried and failed two years ago to establish a
joint venture with Budvar, offering a $2 million investment.
   The attempt created a wave of protest among Budweis consumers
around Ceske Budejovice, 100 miles south of Prague.
   The local newspaper, Jihoceska Pravda (South Bohemian Truth),
quoted beer drinkers at the time as saying they would rather die
than see an agreement with a company whose beer is ``a weak
imitation of the original product.''
   ``You'll never see our beer in cans, we use them (cans) oor
sauerkraut only,'' an irritated young businessman reportedly said
then.
   But Budvar seems ready for American investment now that
Communist rule has been overturned and the economy opened up to
rapid privatization.
   Budvar is to become an independent state-run shareholding
company in January, with the Finance Ministry overseeing its
gradual privatization.
   Once that happens, Budvar, as the largest of state-controlled
breweries, is the most likely candidate for an eventual merger with
Anheuser-Busch.
   Budvar's approximately 300 workers seem to favor the Bud
reunion. They walked out Monday to press state management into
speeding up talks on a merger with the American company and
guaranteeing jobs.
   ``This strike is an extreme solution, which damages the
brewery,'' Josef Tolar, the brewery's acting manager, told the
state news agency CTK after the stoppage was announced.
   ``We were left with no alternative,'' he added.
   The workers say management of state breweries in south Bohemia
is slowing talks with demands for compensation for its past
investments in Budvar.
   Antonin Kratochvile, general manager of the brewery chain, known
as Jihoceske Pivovary, said Budvar has agreed to pay his group 160
million crowns ($6.5 million).
   He refused to comment on American participation in the deal,
saying only it was millions rather than billions of dollars. Other
details of an eventual merger have not been made public. Nor were
details available on how much beer Budvar brews daily.

   The Bush administration indicated Monday that
an aid package to help the Soviet Union get through the winter
could be forthcoming, suggesting it wants to reward Moscow for help
in the Persian Gulf.
   Officials said the aid could include emergency food and medical
supplies as well as trade benefits.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush may
grant trade concessions even if the Soviets do not pass a
liberalized emigration law, which the United States has long said
must precede concessions.
   Fitzwater cited the severity of Soviet economic problems and a
desire to reward Moscow for its political help in the Persian Gulf.
   In Houston, Secretary of State James A. Baker III gave the
clearest sign yet that the administration was prepared to help the
Soviet Union with food and other supplies.
   ``As far as humanitarian assistance, medical assistance, food
and that sort of thing, I know the president will be forthcoming
with respect to trying to help,'' Baker said after Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze specifically requested food aid.
   Fitzwater said the president was considering waiving the
Jackson-Vanik law, which has imposed severe restrictions on Soviet
trade with the United States since 1974, mainly because of its
repression of Jews.
   Earlier this year, administration efforts to liberalize trade
with Moscow were slowed by the Soviet crackdown on independence
movements in Lithuania and other Baltic republics.
   Bush met Monday with Lithuanian President Vytautas Lansbergis.
Even as the United States considers aiding the Soviet economy, the
Kremlin is threatening Lithuania with ``economic catastrophe,''
Lansbergis told reporters after the session.
   He likened the plight of Lithuania to Iraqi-occupied Kuwait and
said he appealed to Bush to ``take an active policy'' if Moscow
escalates its pressure against the breakaway state.
   Afterwards, Fitzwater said Bush relayed to Lansbergis that there
was no change in U.S. support for self-determination for all three
Baltic republics.
   ``The president said the United States has never recognized the
forcible incorporation of the Baltic states into the U.S.S.R. and
assured President Lansbergis that this policy would not change,''
Fitzwater said.
   Lansbergis indicated heand Bush did not discuss what the United
States might do if it provided food aid to the Soviet Union, and
Moscow in turn denied food to the rebellious republics.
   Under pressure from Congress, Bush said in June at his summit
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that further trade
liberalization - including granting Moscow most-favored-nation
status - would be delayed until the Soviet legislature passes a law
liberalizing emigration policies.
   That law has not been passed.
   ``We are considering going ahead with waiver of Jackson-Vanik
without passage of the law,'' said Fitzwater.
   Asked why, the spokesman said that the Soviets had largely
liberalized their emigration policies toward Jews and other
minorities.
   He also cited ``what appears to be a very serious need in terms
of their economy and in terms of their ability to get food
supplies'' and noted ``their cooperation in the Persian Gulf, their
strong support of us in that area.''
   In Houston, Shevardnadze asked specifically for food relief as
he and Baker opened two days of talks that focused on resolving the
remaining differences on a strategic nuclear weapons treaty Bush
and Gorbachev hope to sign in Moscow next month.
   Shevardnadze, posing for pictures with Baker, told reporters,
``We would appreciate, if possible, some food supplies. ... That is
the most acute problem.''
   He added that the Soviets would also like to receive from the
United States ``efficient economic cooperation.''
   Baker said Bush is considering helping the Soviets as they try
to make a difficult transition in their economic system. ``The
United States would want to be of assistance in ways that we can
be,'' Baker said.
   But the Jackson-Vanik curbs remain the biggest obstacles to
giving the Soviet Union access to U.S. markets and banks.
   The law, named after the late Sen. Henry Jackson of Washington
and former Rep. Charles Vanik of Ohio, was enacted to try to force
the Soviets to allow Jews and other minorities to emigrate. Under
Gorbachev Jewish emigration has hit a record.
   Bush is weighing his options on whether to waive the
Jackson-Vanik law, Fitzwater said, indicating that a decision might
be made by the end of the week.
   White House officials said that the issue of waiving the
Jackson-Vanik restrictions was separate from any emergency package
that might be assembled.
   Bush will meet with Shevardnadze at the White House on
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   The State Department praised plans by Angola's
Marxist-stye ruling party to allow a multiparty system and said
Monday that elections should be called as soon as possible.
   The ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola voted
Sunday to revise the constitution and allow democracy before the
end of March.
   The party, known by its Portuguese acronym MPLA, also called for
free-market economic reforms and recommended legislation to
guarantee rights of expression, religion and association, and
freedom of the press.
   ``We are encouraged by the MPLA party decision to move toward
amending the constitution to allow for the creation of other
political parties in Angola,'' said State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher.
   A 15-year civil war between the Soviet-backed government and
U.S.-aided rebels has killed 340,000 people, according government
estimates. Cuban forces backing the government have been reduced
from about 50,000 to 10,000 this year as a result of peace talks.
   The government and rebels are to meet for a sixth round of peace
talks in January in Portugal.
   Boucher urged the government of President Jose Eduardo Dos
Santos rapidly to permit a multiparty system in which the
U.S.-backed rebels and other groups would be given the right to
form and operate as political parties.
   Jonas Savimbi, leader of the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, known as UNITA, said last week that he
would agree to a cease-fire if the ruling party approved a
multiparty system and elections.
   Boucher said the MPLA move does not change U.S. aid plans.
   The United States has been aiding the rebels and has said it
would not stop helping UNITA until the government guarantees them a
role in a multiparty society.

<TEXT>
   A former high-ranking state senator
was sentenced Monday to 12 years in federal prison for corruption
uncovered in an FBI sting in which he sold influence for campaign
contributions.
   Paul Carpenter stood silently when U.S. District Judge Edward
Garcia sentenced him, declining an offer to speak.
   Carpenter, a silver-haired 62-year-old Democrat from suburban
Los Angeles, was convicted in September of racketeering, extortion
and conspiracy. The charges followed an undercover operation at the
state capital. In the sting, an FBI agent posing as a businessman
paid Carpenter $20,000 in campaign contributions to get a bill
through the Legislature.
   At Carpenter's trial, other instances were cited of his shaking
down lobbyists for campaign money.
   Carpenter, who must surrender to authorities by Jan. 7, was also
ordered to repay $20,000 he received from an FBI undercover agent
in the sting operation.
   ``It's a case of proven acceptance of bribery money and
extortion of money in the form of political contributions,'' said
the judge, who called the evidence against Carpenter
``overwhelming.''
   The judge also observed that the former lawmaker felt no
remorse. He said Carpenter's punishment was intended to deter
others. Carpenter will be eligible for parole in four years.
   Carpenter's attorney, Gerard Hinckley, said he would appeal the
sentence.
   A former Senate Democratic Caucus chairman, Carpenter was for
several years one of that body's top fundraisers. After 12 years in
the Senate, he was elected in 1986 to the Board of Equalization.
His sentencing removes Carpenter from the powerful state tax board.
   Carpenter was the second elected state official snagged in the
five-year FBI probe. Joseph Montoya was still a state senator when
he was convicted in February of racketeering, extortion and money
laundering. He is serving a 6{-year prison sentence.
   The investigation is continuing. So far four other people have
pleaded guilty to charges that flowed from it - two former
legislative aides and two former county law enforcers. Another two
former legislative aides are awaiting trial.
   Most of the charges against Carpenter related to his dealings
with John Brennan, an FBI agent who posed as Alabama businessman
Jack Gordon.
   The agent paid Carpenter $20,000 in campaign contributions as a
payoff for Carpenter's help in getting a bill through the Senate to
finance a fictitious shrimp business.
   Carpenter said he told an aide he wouldn't take the money unless
he was assured that he wouldn't have to do anything in return.
   However, the next day, in a tape-recorded conversation with
Brennan, Carpenter promised to serve as the bill's problem-solver
and to ``stroke'' the state treasurer to remove opposition to the
measure.
   The bill was approved by the Legislature but vetoed by Gov.
George Deukmejian, who was tipped off to the FBI investigation.

   President Violeta Chamorro will veto
any cut in her proposed defense budget rather than risk a backlash
from the Sandinista-led army, a top government aide said Monday.
   Minister of the Presidency Antonio Lucayo said Mrs. Chamorro
will not allow the $78.6 million budget plan to be ``mutilated in
such a way as to endanger that security.''
   Mrs. Chamorro's 1991 spending proposal allocates 16 percent of
the $499 million national budget to the armed forces.
   It is a sharp decline from defense budgets under her Sandinista
predecessors, who battled U.S.-backed Contra rebels for about 10
years. But National Assembly is split over the proposal, and many
deputies Mrs. Chamorro's coalition demand even bigger cuts.
   The 39 Sandinista deputies in the 92-member assembly have said
they approve of Mrs. Chamorro's proposal.
   Under Mrs. Chamorro's 8-month-old government, the armed forces
has been trimmed from 100,000 troops to about 28,000.
   The National Assembly is scheduled to begin debate on the budget
Tuesday.
   The military is one of the most sensitive issues confronting
Mrs. Chamorro, who left the armed forces and police in Sandinista
hands. The move assured a peaceful change of governments but
enraged much of the conservative United National Opposition
coalition that backed her candidacy.
   Her UNO critics say Mrs. Chamorro is at the mercy of the
Sandinista armed forces and police.
   The assembly must vote on a budget by Dec. 15 and send it to
Mrs. Chamorro. By law, the 1991 budget must be approved by midnight
on Dec. 20.

   President Bush on Monday told Lithuania's
president he hopes the Soviet Union will work with the leaders of
independence-minded Baltic republics without resorting to threats
or force.
   In the first meeting between a U.S. president and the head of
state of tiny Lithuania, Bush and Vytautas Landbergis discussed
negotiations with Moscow in pursuit of Lithuania's recognition as a
sovereign state.
   While the Kremlin has suspended its economic blockade of
Lithuania pending the outcome of independence talks, there is
``still definitely tension in the situation,'' said Bush spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Landbergis, speaking to reporters immediately after his talk
with Bush in the Oval Office, said his republic ``is being attacked
today by the Kremlin through various means, including threats and
intimidation.''
   ``We are being threatened with economic catastrophe; we are
being threatened with military action against us,'' Landbergis
said. ``Therefore, the purpose of my visit today to the White House
was to ask for some sort of political protection from the United
States.''
   He said he received no firm promise from Bush that the United
States would provide such protection.
   But shortly after the meeting, Fitzwater issued a statement
reviewing the subjects discussed and reiterating U.S. refusal to
recognize the Kremlin's absorption of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia
into the Soviet Union a half century ago.
   ``The president stressed that the U.S. wanted a peaceful
solution to the problem between the Baltic states and the U.S.S.R.
and hoped the Soviet government would work constructively with
Baltic leaders, without resorting to threats, intimidation or the
use of force,'' the statement said.

   A high-level committee said Monday that NASA
must focus on science - and not on flashy, futuristic projects -
both on the space shuttle and on the proposed space station ``if it
is not merely to drift through the decade ahead.''
   The space science program ``ranks above space stations,
aerospace planes, manned missions to the planets, and many other
major pursuits which often receive greater visibility,'' said the
government's Advisory Committee on the Future of the U.S. Space
Program.
   It said NASA was trying to do too much and allowing too little
margin for the unexpected, leading to frequent revamping of major
programs. The agency should concentrate on two major undertakings:
studying Earth's environment from space in a ``Mission to Planet
Earth'' and exploring space in a ``Mission from Planet Earth.''
   The committee said the space shuttle should be flown only when
astronaut skills are needed and that no new shuttles should be
built after the Endeavour, now under construction, is completed.
Instead, the committee recommends that a new unmanned heavy-lift
launch vehicle be developed and used for all but missions requiring
human presence.
   ``Now it's our challenge,'' said Vice President Dan Quayle, head
of the National Space Council, after he was briefed by the
committee. ``This report will give our space program a needed shot
in the arm.''
   Richard Truly, the NASA administrator, said he has invited the
committee and its chairman to meet with the agency's senior
managers ``so we can deal with the recommendations in the report.''
But overall, he said, he sees no major change in NASA's pace of
science programs.
   He took issue with allowing the shuttle production line to close
after Endeavour. ``We should not give up the ability to build one
if for any reason we need to build another one,'' Truly said.
   Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate science
subcommittee, praised the report as ``a reasoned view of the space
program'' and said it will form the basis of a congressional review
in the next session.
   NASA assembled the outside review at the request of the Bush
administration after a spate of embarrassments that included
grounding of the shuttle fleet because of leaks on Columbia and
Atlantis and a flaw in grinding the Hubble Space Telescope's
mirror.
   Repairs were made, and Columbia, the leakiest of the shuttles,
was returning to Earth at 12:51 a.m. EST Tuesday in California
after a nine-day flight. Atlantis flew last month.
   ``NASA is neither as troubled as some suggest nor as good as it
will have to be to carry out the program we have recommended,''
Norman Augustine, chairman of the 12-member committee told a news
conference. But he said the agency was at a crossroads.
   The committee's report said ``a focus must be given to this
program now if it is not merely to drift through the decade ahead.
Although there is no particular timetable that can in good
conscience be assigned to this pursuit, it nonetheless sorely needs
agreement as to direction.''
   Augustine is chairman and chief executive officer of the Martin
Marietta Corporation, a major rocket builder. He said he did not
participate in discussions of a new heavy-lift vehicle.
   Other members of the committee included Edward C. Aldridge Jr.,
former secretary of the Air Force, Joseph P. Allen, former
astronaut; Edward P. Boland, a former congressman whose committee
oversaw NASA spending, and Thomas O. Paine, NASA administrator
during the Apollo moon flight era.
   The space agency already has moved toward a commitment to
science projects. It stopped delivering commercial satellites to
orbit after the Challenger disaster in 1986 and last month
conducted its last secret Pentagon mission, although it still has
three unclassified Defense Department cargoes.
   The committee said the civil space program is overly dependent
on the shuttle for access to space but said it should not be used
for satellite deliveries, which can be carried out on unmanned
rockets.
   ``It's a mistake to risk seven people and one-fourth of our
shuttles to place a commercial communications satellite into
space,'' Augustine said.
   The committee said a subject not often mentioned is the
statistical probability that ``we are likely to lose another space
shuttle in the next several years, probably before the planned
space station is completely established on orbit.''
   The report did not mince words about the space station, which
had been planned for the mid-'90s but has run into major financing
and other snags.
   ``We do not believe that the space station Freedom, as we now
know it, can be justified solely on the basis of the non-biological
science it can perform,'' the committee said. Instead its
objectives should be only two: primarily, life sciences and
secondarily, microgravity experimentation.
   ``We believe the space station Freedom can be simplified,
reduced in cost, and constructed on a more evolutionary, modular
basis that enables end-to-end testing of most systems prior to
launch,'' the report said.
   The committee sought to deflect suggestions that an agency other
than NASA should be in charge of space activities, saying ``NASA
and only NASA'' has the knowledge and expertise to sustain the
country's space program.

<HEAD>Authorities Say No PCB Risk in Flooded Subdivision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators on Monday lifted an
evacuation order imposed on a flooded subdivision after
cancer-causing PCBs were discovered in the oily floodwater.
   The decision allowed residents forced from 120 homes near the
Little Calumet River to return to assess flood damage and gather
personal belongings. Six inches of rain late last month left the
420-home Wicker Park Manor subdivision under five feet of water.
   Polychlorinated biphenyls, once used as insulators in electrical
transformers, were banned by the federal government in the 1970s.
   The main east-west street through the subdivision became a
dividing line Wednesday after the Environmental Protection Agency
detected double the acceptable safe limit of PCBs in the
floodwater.
   Residents living north of the street were banned from returning
to their homes, while other residents were granted access. The
source of the PCBs is not known.
   The entire subdivision was closed Friday while EPA testers
broadened the scope of their sampling to areas south of the street.
A growing number of residents were permitted to return through
Sunday as followup tests showed no detectable levels of PCBs in
homes, heating oil, soil or debris, said EPA spokesman Philip
Schuette.
   The negative test results suggest the EPA may have trouble
finding the origin of the contamination, he said.
   Frank DeAtley, emergency coordinator for the Highland town
council, said local officials accepted the EPA recommendation to
allow access to homes despite not knowing where the PCBs came from.
``I'm sure we'll all feel better if we know what the source was.
Likewise, you have to move on when you can.''
   The White House has issued a disaster declaration making Lake
County flood victims eligible for low-cost federal loans for
rebuilding.

<HEAD>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Often Ignored, Acute Among Indians, Panel
Told</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors and government agencies are looking
the other way while alcoholic women, including a disproportionate
number of Indians, give birth to thousands of children with
debilitating handicaps, a Senate committee was told Monday.
   Many doctors fail to confront women who drink during pregnancy
and aren't trained to diagnose and treat children afflicted with
the resulting birth defects, said parents and experts in testimony
to the Senate Finance subcommittee on Social Security and family
policy.
   About 5,000 babies are born each year with fetal alcohol
syndrome, a cause of mental retardation, and 35,000 more suffer
from less severe effects of a mother's drinking, according to the
National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence.
   The problem is particularly acute on Indian reservations, where
the rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is seven times the national
average, said Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D. One of every four children
on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota is born with the
malady, Daschle said.
   Fetal alcohol syndrome could create ``a continual underclass in
our society who can't function,'' said Michael Dorris, a Dartmouth
University professor who adopted three children with alcohol-caused
birth defects.
   ``In this great land of plenty, many babies are born exposed to
such high levels of alcohol and drugs before birth that they die or
are born intoxicated,'' said Jeaneen Grey Eagle, director of a Pine
Ridge treatment program. ``They are doomed to spend the rest of
their life with birth defects and or mental retardation,'' she
said.
   Doctors on the reservation shy away from diagnosing children
with the diseases or confronting their mothers during pregnancy
because of social stigmas, Grey Eagle said.
   She told of one baby so intoxicated at birth that she passed
out, adding that her mother, who had no prenatal care, was drunk
when she arrived at the hospital.
   The problem is most common among poor Indians and blacks, but a
Maryland woman who grew up in a upper middle class home in suburban
Washington told the committee she gave birth to a severely
handicapped daughter and had two other babies die before seeking
treatment for alcoholism.
   ``I never meant to harm my children,'' said Kathleen Tavenner of
Emmitsburg, Md. ``It was ignorance ... that harmed my child.''
   She had been a client of several welfare programs while abusing
alcohol, but none of the social workers confronted her, she said.
   ``No one ever intervened. No one ever said ... are you having a
problem with drugs or alcohol?''
   Dorris, who wrote a book about his experience with fetal alcohol
syndrome, said his children have been arrested for shoplifting,
sexual misconduct and violent behavior.
   ``They maintain no enduring friendships, set for themselves no
realistic goals, can call upon no bedrock inner values to
distinguish right from wrong, safe from dangerous,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   ``I'm flying, I'm flying,'' Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze exulted Monday as he sat at
the controls of a mock U.S. space shuttle. ``Let's take off.''
   Alongside, Secretary of State James A. Baker III played the role
of co-pilot with a wide grin on his face.
   ``He's the guest, I feel more secure that way, because I can't
fly,'' Baker said, explaining why he had yielded the controls to
the Soviet minister.
   Their visit to the Johnson Space Center reflected the new warmth
in U.S.-Soviet relations. So did a pledge by Baker to consider
providing food and other humanitarian assistance to the Soviets as
they stagger at the brink of economic disintegration.
   ``We would appreciate it,'' Shevardnadze said softly, telling
reporters that food supplies were ``the most acute problem'' facing
his people.
   Baker assured him that ``the United States would want to be of
assistance in ways that we can be.''
   Baker and Shevardnadze are holding two days of talks on the
crisis in the Persian Gulf, a still-unfinished treaty to trim U.S.
and Soviet nuclear weapons and other tough issues.
   Among those issues is the lingering conflict in Afghanistan
between the Soviet-backed central governeent and rebels armed by
the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
   U.S. and Soviet sources said the two sides were close to a
decision to suspend their weapons shipments. An announcement would
be made in a statement at the end of their meeting Tuesday.
   As part of the deal, the Bush administration would accept
President Najibullah continuing in charge in Kabul during a
transition to an elected government.
   The Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979 and withdrew last year.
They provide the pro-Moscow government with about $500 million in
military aid a year.
   The United States backs a coalition of rebels, some of them
ardent Moslem fundamentalists, with about $430 million in annual
assistance.
   Putting those issues aside temporarily, Baker and Shevardnadze
toured the space center and spoke by telephone to the commander of
the Columbia as the shuttle prepared to return to Earth.
   ``We are extremely proud of the work you are doing,'' Baker told
the crew.
   Then Shevardnadze, speaking in Russian, picked up another phone
and told the astronauts: ``You are paving new roads in space for
the happiness of all of us here on earth.''
   Astrophysicist Jeffrey A. Hoffman replied in Russian: ``We are
very pleased.''
   The United States and the Soviet Union have competed vigorously
in space, both for prestige and for whatever military advantage
could be gained. But the superpowers have also engaged in some
cooperation. A dozen American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts have
been on joint missions.
   ``All of us would like to see less military application and more
peace missions,'' Shevardnadze said.
   Before Baker and Shevardnadze arrived at the space center, a
spirited German shepherd sniffed for explosives, slipping as it
tried to maneuver on a shiny plexiglass floor in a mock space
cabin.
   Baker gave the Soviet foreign minister a flag from a joint 1975
docking mission. In return, Shevardnadze presented Baker with
American and Texas flags from an interplanetary probe.
   Shevardnadze said he was trying to persuade Baker to have their
next meeting in space.

<HEAD>Soviet Lawmakers Approve Guarantees for Investment, Unions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers in the Supreme Soviet voted Monday to
give investors and labor organizers more legal protection
throughout the Soviet Union.
   The legislation dealt mainly with the principles of a market
economy and did not address issues of currency convertibility or
property ownership, nor the dismantling of a state bureaucracy that
often saddles investors with red tape.
   The Supreme Soviet approved general principles of investment
policy that guarantees ``equal rights for all investors,
irrespective of property forms,'' Tass reported. ``The act is aimed
at forming market-type investment relations and stepping up
entrepreneurial activities in the country.''
   The state news agency said investors under the new legislation
must be reimbursed for any losses incurred by actions of ``state
bodies ... violating their rights.''
   The legislature later adopted a law on trade unions that
``provides for the independence of trade unions from government,
economic and political bodies and their complete material and
financial independence,'' Tass reported. It gave few other details.
   The law on labor unions comes two months after 900 Soviet coal
miners, meeting in the Ukraine, established their own independent
union and set up a governing structures that rejected state
involvement.
   For most of the Soviet Union's 73-year history, labor unions
were outlawed on the theory that the ruling Communist Party
embodied interests of workers as the leading party of the workers'
state.

<HEAD>Libya Asks U.N. Meeting on U.S. Airlift of Libyans from Chad</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya's U.N. ambassador accused America on
Monday of training Libyan POWs in hhad as guerrillas to undermine
Col. Moammar Gadhafi's government. The Red Cross expressed concern
over a U.S. airlift of the POWs.
   On Friday and Saturday, as victorious rebels consolidated their
control of Chad, the United States flew out about 600 Libyan
prisoners of war held by the former Chadian government to Nigeria.
   Libyan Ambassador Ali Treiki demanded an emergency Security
Council meeting and said he would discuss scheduling one with
council president Abdalla Saleh al-Ashtal, the Yemeni ambassador,
on Monday.
   Treiki said was concerned about the well-being of the Libyans,
and about the danger of a U.S.-organized plot against his
government.
   ``There is no doubt that the United States has used them. They
want to use them against our country,'' he said.
   ``We are worried about them. The Red Cross has not been allowed
to interview them.''
   The Libyan said it is against international law and the Geneva
Convention on treatment of POWs ``to indoctrinate prisoners of
war.''
   The U.S. ambassador to Chad, Richard Bogosian, has declined to
comment on reports that U.S. military advisers trained the captured
soldiers for commando operations against Libya.
   Reports on Sunday said the airlifted Libyans' final destination
was believed to be Zaire.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross complained Monday
in a statement in Geneva that it was not allowed to supervise the
airlift and said it wanted to interview the prisoners to make sure
they left voluntarily.
   ``The ICRC has not been able to carry out protection work on
their behalf as it would have wished,'' it said.
   A spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
ICRC was making representations to the United States and others in
a bid to gain access to the prisoners.
   She said an ICRC delegate was at Chad's N'Djamena airport, but
could not meet with prisoners privately to make sure they wanted to
leave.
   The ICRC said it was never allowed to visit Libyan prisoners
captured during the long conflict between Chad and Libya, despite
repeated representations to Chad's former government led by
President Hissene Habre.
   Idriss Deby's rebel forces toppled Habre this month. Deby is now
interim president.
   Treiki said Monday that 17 Libyan POWs were slain during the
rebel takeover of Chad, but that he did not know who killed them or
under what circumstances.
   Libyan Foreign Minister Ibrahim Bashari said on Sunday the
evacuated Libyan POWs ``are held against their will. They were
taken hostage because they have a lot of information. They were
trained and armed to destabilize the government of their own
country or the political system of other nations.''
   Bashari spoke after meeting with Nigerian President Gen. Ibrahim
Babangida in efforts to repatriate the rest of the former POWs.
   A French news report said troops of Chad's new government on
Sunday began dismantling a well-armed camp reputedly used by the
Libyans. Agence France-Presse said the POWs' camp, about six miles
north of N'Djamena, was well-stocked with arms and communications
equipment.
   Other former POWs returned to Libya, which helped arm Deby's
fighters.
   Chadian forces captured the Libyan fighters in clashes in 1983
and 1987. Chad and Libya have battled on and off in a border
dispute for more than 20 years.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for an Army National Guard
sergeant asked a federal judge Monday to order his return from the
Persian Gulf until President Bush gets congressional permission to
wage war on Iraq.
   Michael Ratner, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional
Rights, argued that Sgt. Michael R. Ange of Beaufort, N.C. should
be returned from active duty in the Middle East because he faces
``the realistic threat he will be required to fight in an
unconstitutional war.''
   Ratner argued that President Bush has violated both the war
powers clause of the Constitution and the 1973 War Powers
Resolution by preparing for war with Iraq without obtaining
permission from Congress.
   The lawyer asked U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth to affirm
``what every school child knows: that Congress has the power to
declare war.''
   But Justice Department attorney John Tyler, urging the court to
stay out of the dispute, said Bush has never ruled out the
possibility that he would ask Congress to authorize the use of
force to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
   ``We don't know that the president will not seek authority from
Congress; he has never so stated,'' Tyler said.
   Ratner, citing statements from Bush and other administration
officials, said there is ``strong evidence'' that the president
would launch an attack on Iraqi troops without seeking
congressional approval.
   Ange, a police officer, was activated last month when his
National Guard unit was mobilized and sent to Fort Lee, Va. He was
unsuccessful in winning a temporary restraining order to block his
deployment to the Persian Gulf.
   Now seeking an injunction ordering his removal from the Middle
East, Ange contends that Bush violated the War Powers Resolution by
failing to report to Congress that he had sent troops into a
situation of imminent hostilities.
   Under the resolution, the president must end such a deployment
in 60 days unless Congress authorizes its continuation.
   Lamberth noted that Bush told Congress after sending troops to
Saudi Arabia that he didn't consider hostilities to be imminent.
   The judge expressed doubts over whether the requirement that
Bush seek authority from Congress before waging war so clearly
expressed by the Constitution.
   ``There have been a number of instances where presidents have
proceeded without a declaration of war,'' Lamberth said, alluding
to more than 200 occasions when U.S. troops fought or threatened to
fight without congressiional approval. The nation has fought five
wars declared by Congress.
   ``If you look at some of the early things that happened in the
lifetime of the actual framers, the way these presidents acted
would give you some pause as to whether the Constitution was that
clear,'' Lamberth said in reference to early American military
adventures that included combat with the Barbary pirates of North
Africa in 1801-1805 and again in 1815.
   Tyler urged dismissal of Ange's lawsuit on the ground that the
court was incapable of determining what were basically political
questions best addressed by Congress and the president.
   ``The complexity of the Persian Gulf situation defies the
court's ability to step in,'' Tyler said.
   Lamberth questioned whether he was in a position to judge
whether Bush was really preparing for war or just trying to bluff
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein into removing his troops from Iraq.
   ``How do I decide this is a real threat of war by the president
rather than something else to ensure that peace occurs?'' the judge
asked.
   Lamberth did not indicate when he would rule. A lawsuit by 54
Democratic lawmakers that challenges Bush's power to wage war
without congressional approval is pending before another judge in
the same court.

   The cost of living rose faster in London and
Zurich than other major cities the past six months but Tehran
easily remains the world's most expensive city. According to a
survey released Monday, Tokyo was a distant second to the Iranian
capital in the cost of living.
   The weaker dollar further widened the cost-of-living gap between
the expensive cities of Europe and the major cities of North
America, said the survey from Business International, a business
information company.
   All Western European cities have become more expensive, but the
sharpest increases came in Britain and Switzerland, the company
said. However, the Scandinavian capitals remain Europe's costliest
cities.
   Business International twice a year compares the cost of
maintaining a Western standard of living in more than 100 cities.
   The surveys cover grocery items, alcoholic beverages, household
supplies, personal care products, clothing and footwear, utility
costs, domestic help, recreation and transportation.
   It calculated its index by comparing average prices from each
city to prices in New York, which it used as a base city with a
score of 100. New York ranked 24th in the latest survey.
   Here is Business International's listing of the 15 most
expensive cities in the world, and how they scored on the index.
Business International didn't provide the rankings or scores from
six months ago.
   1. Tehran, Iran, 225

   3. Abidjan, the Ivory Coast, 161

   The body of a 5-year-old girl was found
Monday in the wreckage of an Army base apartment building leveled
in an explosion apparently caused by a natural gas leak.
   Seventeen people were injured, four critically, in the Sunday
night blast. Fort Benjamin Harrison residents criticized the Army
for failing to adequately warn them of the danger of the gas leak.
   The explosion ripped through a four-unit apartment building in
Harrison Village, destroying it and heavily damaging a second
building, base officials said.
   The blast occurred hours after fire authorities arrived to
investigate a gas leak at another building in the complex, which
housed enlisted personnel. That building was being evacuated when
the blast went off several hundred feet away, said Major Ronald
Downing.
   Marion County Deputy Coroner Charles W. Green said he could not
conclusively identify the dead child discovered by rescue workers
Monday morning until after dental records were checked. However,
base officials said there was little doubt it was a 5-year-old girl
who had been reported missing earlier. The girl's identity was not
released.
   As fire officials investigated the leak, military police
notified some residents that their gas was turned off and they
might not have heat until Monday, said Sgt. Clayton R. Glass, who
first reported the leak behind his quarters.
   ``We all knew what it was as soon as we heard it. ... We all
smelled gas outside, it was so thick,'' said Victoria Glynn, a
resident.
   She said military police asked residents if they wanted to be
evacuated to a hotel or to stay in their homes. ``We thought it was
for our convenience because we wouldn't have heat. We were never
told there was possible danger.''
   Joan Adams, another resident, said military police who knocked
on her door told her ``there was no danger for us to stay here.''
   Lt. Col. Bill Carey, provost marshal, said, ``We didn't feel the
whole area needed to be evacuated.''
   ``We don't know exactly what caused the explosion,'' said Dan
O'Brien of Citizens Gas Co., which supplies gas to the
base-operated system.
   ``What puzzled us was the fire continued,'' he said.``It was
gas-fed, which surprised us because the gas was shut off.''
   Residents of the 240-unit complex were allowed to return briefly
Monday to gather belongings, but they were not told when they could
move back.
   Six people remained hospitalized for treatment of severe burns,
four in critical condition and two in serious condition,
authorities at Riley and Wishard Memorial hospitals said Monday.
Eleven rescue workers and military personnel were treated and
released.

   Army sharpshooters were posted at key
intersections and a rare curfew was imposed in Bethlehem following
the latest rash of violence and Arab unrest, authorities said
Monday.
   Military snipers wounded at least four Palestinian rock-throwers
in ambushes staged at road junctions in the West Bank, Israel
television said.
   A military communique said the shootings were part of ``an
increased special action against stone-throwing on civilian and
army vehicles.''
   Previously, soldiers have had orders to shoot stone-throwers in
life-threatening situations, but rarely have sharpshooters been
stationed on roads.
   In Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, the streets were nearly
deserted Monday under a curfew imposed after a Sunday bombing on
the Jerusalem-Bethlehem highway that killed an Israeli soldier and
wounded two others.
   Normally, Bethlehem is crowded during the Christmas season with
visitors coming to the Church of the Nativity, built on the site
where tradition says Christ was born.
   Israel radio said the bombing was claimed by the Jordan-based
Moslem Fundamentalist Islamic Jihad.
   The national Itim news agency quoted military sources as saying
they believed Force 17 of the Palestine Liberation Organization's
mainstream Fatah movement was responsible. The report did not
elaborate.
   In Bethelem, army chief of staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron vowed to
take a hard-line approach against Palestinian assailants.
   ``We will continue with all the means at our disposal to fight
and strike at this murderous, violent core,'' Shomron said.
   ``What is depressing and increasing tension is the absence of
any prospect of peaceful dialogue,'' said Bethlehem's Mayor Elias
Freij.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, a Palestinian man was shot and
stabbed to death by masked assailants on suspicion of collaborating
with Israeli authorities, Arab reports said Monday.
   Sami Abdel Rahman abu Sabra, 34, of Deir el Balah refugee camp
was the 317th Palestinian slain by fellow Arabs during the
three-year-old uprising.
   Palestinian reports said 19 Arabs were wounded in scattered
clashes with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza.
   In another incident, an explosion went off Monday night near a
civilian bus as it headed to the Jewish settlement of Elon Moreh
near Nablus, about 35 miles north of Jerusalem, Israeli reports
said. No casualties were reported.
   Four firebombs were thrown at Israeli vehicles in the Ramallah
area, about 10 miles north of Jerusalem, causing no damage or
injuries, the reports added.
   Fifty-four Israelis have died in the uprising. Israeli soldiers
and civilians have killed 777 Palestinians during the period.

   Someone with a powerful shotgun has shot
at nine homes in the dead of night in the past two weeks, and
terrified residents have taken to sleeping on floors and removing
Christmas lights.
   ``I just thank God it hit away from the part of the house where
everyone was sleeping,'' Michele Michalides said after her sliding
glass door was shattered by a slug. ``It's amazing people haven't
gotten hurt.''
   Michalides' home was one of four hit Saturday. The shootings,
which began Nov. 27, occurred in different neighborhoods within a
few miles of each other, and only one house has been hit twice -
the home of Police Chief Thomas King.
   ``Chief was standing within 12 feet of where the bullet came
through,'' Deputy Chief Paul Brodeur said. He said the first time
King's home was hit police believed it was a coincidence but now
they're not so sure.
   ``It's hard to believe it's not directed at him,'' he said.
   Brodeur said a man and his wife were showered with glass as they
watched television and a little girl who got up from bed to use the
bathroom was ``missed by just feet.''
   The type of weapon, apparently a 12-gauge shotgun loaded with
slugs, is particularly alarming.
   ``They have extreme penetrating power and can travel through
walls like nothing,'' Detective Mark Putney said. ``These are the
type of guns used for hunting large game.''
   Police said they have no motive or suspects. They are telling
people in the area to keep their blinds and drapes drawn at night
and keep lights off. Authorities have beefed up patrols in the area
and $2,000 has been offered for help in arresting and convicting
the perpetrators.
   Hearing a news report that people might be arming themselves,
Mayor Ray Wieczorek urged them not to do anything foolhardy.
   Michalides said she was dozing on the couch when the sound of
her deck's glass door shattering made her bolt upright.
   ``I can't get the sound out of my head,'' she said. ``I was
running around the house screaming. I didn't know it was a gunshot.
If I had seen the holes in the wall, I would have been in a million
pieces myself.''
   The slugs went through the wood deck railing, burst the door,
hit the back wall of the dining room and ricocheted into the living
room.
   Now Michalides keeps her curtains drawn and her lights out after
dark, and worries that her four children might get up in the middle
of the night to get a drink.
   Across the street, Syvie Gosselin has her two daughters, 12 and
9, sleeping on the floor, but the youngest slept with her parents
Sunday night. She said a friend down the street moved her children
upstairs and took the lighted Christmas decorations out of the
windows.
   ``Mine aren't going up this year either,'' Gosselin said.
   Roberta Veilleux, whose home was hit, also draws her curtains,
but still plans to put up a Christmas tree with lights.
   ``We're trying to live as normal as possible,'' she said.

China under an export subsidy program.
   Under the Export Enhancement Program, the sales will be made
through normal commercial channels at competitive world prices. A

   An additional 10,005 metric tons remains available under the

   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell will
head a delegation of eight Democratic senators that will visit
Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel later this week.
   ``It is important for members of Congress to have first-hand
knowledge of the serious issues in the Persian Gulf,'' the Maine
Democrat said in a statement announcing the seven-day trip.
   A 19-member House delegation, meanwhile, was leaving Tuesday for
a trip to Saudi Arabia that also will include a stop in Israel.
That group is led by Intelligence Committee Chairman Anthony
Beilenson, D-Calif., and Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the senior GOP
member of the panel.
   ``Through meetings with our allies, briefings with U.S. military
commanders and discussions with our servicemen and women in Saudi
Arabia, I am hopeful that this trip will increase our understanding
of the issues in the Middle East,'' Mitchell said.
   Joining him on the Senate delegation leaving Thursday will be:
Sens. Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Richard Bryan, D-Nev.; Bob Graham,
D-Fla.; Herbert Kohl, D-Wis.; Charles Robb, D-Va.; Richard Shelby,
D-Ala.; and Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   The members of the delegation will travel first to Jiddah, Saudi
Arabia, where they are scheduled to meet with King Fahd.
   After military briefings and meetings with service personnel in
Dhahran, they will go to Cairo for talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and other officials.
   The delegation also is scheduled to visit Jerusalem and meet
there with Israeli officials.

   Communist leader Ramiz Alia agreed on
Monday to meet with striking students, a day after police engaged
in fist fights with student demonstrators.
   A diplomat in Tirana reached by telephone earlier in the day
reported there some people were hurt and many were arrested in
Sunday's rare show of public defiance against the Communist regime.
   ``The situation at Tirana University continues to be in
disorder,'' the official ATA news agency said late Monday in
reporting on what appeared a full-scale protest of university
students in the Albanian capital.
   It said most students boycotted classes, gathering instead at
dormitories to draw up a demand for a meeting with Alia ``to
express to him their problems and troubles.'' Alia is both head of
state and chief of the Communist Party.
   ATA said Sunday that the students were infuriated by a power
outage that left dormitories without heat and light. It said
demonstrators tried to exploit the situation for ``political
ends.''
   The brief dispatch appeared to be the first instance that
official news media reported on a confrontation between police and
demonstrators before foreign media.
   This was in line with recent moves to slowly open Albania to the
outside world and ease controls on the country's 3.2 million
citizens.
   Albanian leaders have rejected multiparty democracy of the kind
that has replaced orthodox Marxist rule in other East European
countries.
   ``It was learned that Comrade Ramiz Alia accepted ... (the
students') request to meet and discuss with a students'
representation, recommending the others to pursue regularly classes
at the university,'' ATA said Monday.
   But it said that by Monday night no meeting with Alia had taken
place - ``because the students have not yet chosen their
representatives.''
   ATA said Education Minister Skender Gjinushi transmitted Alia's
message to striking students, a clear sign of how seriously the
protest is being taken.
   The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sunday's
demonstration started at 10 a.m. and lasted until police dispersed
protesters at 1 p.m. He said ``a great many students'' took part
but gave no estimates.

<HEAD>Actor Corey Feldman Sentenced to Four Years Probation on Drug
Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Corey Feldman was placed on four years
probation and fined $5,000 Monday in a plea bargain related to two
drug possession arrests.
   The teen-age star of such films as ``The Lost Boys'' and ``Stand
by Me'' pleaded no contest to two charges of heroin possession and
one of cocaine possession. In exchange, prosecutors agreed to
dismiss felony charges of heroin possession for sale and
transportation of heroin.
   As part of the plea bargain with Superior Court Judge Gordon
Ringer, Feldman agreed to finish a seven-month drug rehabilitation
program, which he entered in October.
   Ringer had issued a bench warrant for Feldman on Friday a day
Feldman was arrested on a misdemeanor traffic warrant and for
driving with a suspended license. He is to appear in traffic court
on Jan. 2.
   Ringer issued the warrant after learning of the traffic arrest
and Feldman's suspension from Cry Help, the live-in drug treatment
program. Feldman was suspended forhhaving an unauthorized visitor.
   As part of the rehabilitation program, Feldman will be barred
from working in the entertainment industry, said attorney Richard
Hirsch.
   Feldman, 19, was arrested Sept. 20 in connection with unpaid
traffic tickets. Officers said they found two packets of heroin in
his sock during a search at a North Hollywood police station.
   He was arrested March 9 during a traffic stop when officers
found 25 balloons containing heroin and cocaine in his car, police
said. A short time after, he urged his fans to resist drugs.
   Feldman's publicist, MichaelLevine, said Monday that the actor
would continue to do anti-drug work, even though it was not part of
his sentence. He said Feldman believed the sentence was ``fair and
equitable.''

   Twenty-four thousand Marines, the
largest troop review the Corps has formed this century, received a
ceremonial send-off Monday as they prepared to join U.S. troops in
the Middle East.
   ``I want to salute my warriors today,'' Marine Corps Commandant
Gen. Al Gray told the massed members of the 2nd Marine
Expeditionary Force.
   Gray told the Marines and the 10,000 family members and
supporters at the send-off that the U.S. response to the invasion
is not about oil.
   ``We have built a very firm alliance in that region,'' he
said.``Many different countries, nations ... and different
religious beliefs have banded together to stop this terrorist
aggression.
   ``Only the United States could take the lead to provide
stability throughout the world and others have rallied to our
cause,'' he said.
   The formation included about 8,000 Marine reservists from across
the country.
   Adm. Powell Carter Jr., commander-in-chief of Marine Corps Fleet
Atlantic, told the leathernecks that ``we all hope that this array
of fighting forces along with the economic sanctions ... will
convince Saddam Hussein to respect the will of the world and get
out of Kuwait.''
   ``If they don't, we know you'll do your job. You are Marines,''
he said.
   The Marines will join others already stationed in the Persian
Gulf region, bringing the total number of Marines in active duty
there to 60,000.
   About 400,000 American troops will be in the Middle East by
year's end.
   Units of the force have been flying to Saudi Arabia since the
last week of November in groups of up to 400. But the deployment
will begin in earnest Wednesday, when the Marines are airlifted out
of Cherry Point Air Station at a rate of about 1,000 a day, said
base spokesman Maj. Jay Farrar.
   The imminent departure of the Marines is something most military
families accept, said Paula Lawrence, whose 2-year-old son, Ralph
Jr., sported camouflage pants and a Marine cap.
   ``You know they have to go, but you never get used to it,'' said
Mrs. Lawrence, whose husband, Warrant Officer Ralph Lawrence, is
among those scheduled to deploy this month.

   Vice President Dan Quayle accused
congressional Democrats on Monday of playing politics with the
Persian Gulf crisis, saying some of them are ``portraying
themselves as the party of peace'' and the Republican
administration as bent on war.
   He did not name any Democrats as he asked Republican governors
to help counter that message by speaking out for President Bush's
policy.
   Quayle denounced Senate and House hearings on U.S. policy toward
Iraq as a vehicle for criticism without accountability - although
Bush had said those inquiries were all right with him.
   ``They felt compelled to have hearings but not compelled to
allow the full Congress to vote on the actions taken by the
president,'' Quayle told the Republican Governors Association.
   When a governor asked why the administration didn't seek a
conditional declaration of war, Quayle said that had posed a
dilemma because ``there is no perceived consensus in the
Congress,'' and division or restrictive measures could undercut
Bush policy.
   Despite his criticism, Quayle said he believes that ``when the
chips are down, when America's vital interests are on the line, the
majority of Congress can rise above partisan politics,'' and will
support Bush.
   The vice president said solid congressional unity behind Bush
``would strengthen the chances for peace.
   ``But that would require Congress to resist the temptation to
use the current hearings on the gulf for partisan political
advantage,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, by portraying themselves as
the party of peace and the administration as the party of war, some
congressional Democrats - but by no means all congressional
Democrats - seem to have placed partisanship above statesmanship.''
   In Washington, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed
Services Committee, which held hearings on Persian Gulf policy, was
not available for comment, according to his press aide, Scott
Williams.
   Williams pointed to some of Nunn's appearance Saturday on the
CNN ``Evans and Novak'' in which Nunn said, ``I think the hearings
have been very responsible,'' and, ``When the guns start firing and
when the troops are in war, I think you will find Sam Nunn and most
other people behind the American flag and behind the men and women
who are over there risking their lives.''
   Earlier, another administration official had urged the governors
to push for a capital gains tax cut as a step to get the economy
moving and ease the dual pressures of slumping state revenues and
increasing needs.
   ``It is time for, if you will, a Reagan-type tax cut,''
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp told them.
   ``The revenues of the states are suffering from the high tax on
capital gains, over which you have no control unless you join the
debate,'' Kemp said.
   To the argument that a policy seeking to generate tax revenues
by cutting tax rates is a free lunch dream, Kemp replied:
   ``There is a free lunch to governors. It is that if we get this
economy moving again at the federal level, it will be felt at the
state level.''
   He said the capital gains tax rate should be cut to 15 percent
as President Bush proposed this year, and eliminated entirely on
assets held for longer than three years.
   ``It would unlock trillions of dollars,'' Kemp said, benefit all
Americans and disprove Democratic assertions that Republicans want
tax cuts that benefit only the rich.
   Opening the two-day conference, Gov. James G. Martin of North
Carolina told his colleagues ``state governments in all parts of
this great nation are being squeezed ... caught in that vise
between declining revenues and pressing needs.''
   He said it will take innovation and more productive use of
dwindling tax resources to deal with the problem.
   But there were more speeches on the challenge than specific
answers to the dilemma.
   William J. Bennett, the outgoing drug policy director who is to
become chairman of the Republican National Committee next month,
told the governors that politicians in both parties should ``stop
talking past each other'' and find steps that will work to improve
the lives of Americans who need help.
   He said his list includes protection against crime and violence,
better education and equal opportunity.
   Bennett said equal opportunity doesn't require affirmative
action that would involve ``preference by race'' in hiring or
education. He said he thinks affirmative action should be an issue
of political debate.
   Democratic leaders plan to try to reenact the civil rights bill
President Bush vetoed earlier this year on grounds it would impose
racial quotas. The administration plans to propose its own version
once again.
   Republicans made the quota question an issue in this year's
campaign, especially in North Carolina and California. Bennett said
it is a debate that should continue.
   ``I do think this is an issue that we should talk about,'' he
told reporters.
   He said he favors affirmative action if it means that minority
Americans get equal word of opportunities for jobs or education,
and an equal opportunity to fill them. Bennett said if minority
applicants get an edge because schools or employers want to promote
diversity on their rosters, that is okay with him. ``Diversity is
not a bad end and aim in itself,'' he said.
   A dozen GOP governors, three governors-elect and one candidate
were attending the conference. ``I'm a governor-elect in limbo,''
said Fife Symington of Arizona, who led narrowly in the Nov. 6
election but did not get a clear majority and faces a Feb. 26
runoff election.

   A warm spell settled over much of the United States Monday, with
temperatures 10 to 20 degrees warmer than normal for the second
week in December.
   The unseasonable warmth stretched from the central Atlantic
Coast across the Ohio and Mississippi valleys and into the northern
two-thirds of the Plains region.
   Cheyenne, Wyo., reached 66 degrees to set a record high for the
date. The previous mark of 64 had stood since 1939. Other cities
with record highs Monday included Grand Island, Neb., with 66;
Laramie, Wyo., 58; and Sioux Falls, S.D., 53.
   Light snow was scattered over north-central Minnesota, and from
northern Vermont across northern Maine. Rain fell over northwest
California, western and northern Oregon, eastern and northern
Washington, northern Idaho and northwest Montana.
   There were no reports of measurable snowfall or heavy rainfall
during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST.
   The nation's low was 7 below zero at Jackson, Wyo. Temperatures
around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 24 degrees at Warroad,
Minn. to 80 at Oceanside, Calif.

<HEAD>Greenland Premier Calls Election in Wake of Political Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greenland Premier Jonathan Motzfeldt
has called for March elections following a scandal arising from
allegations that Cabinet ministers misused public funds, news
reports said Monday.
   Opponents of Motzfeldt's socialist government claim to have
documents to show that government members, including the premier,
spent state money on lavish meals for the party faithful, the
Greenland newspaper Atuagagdliutit said.
   Motzfeldt, a pastor of the Greenland Lutheran Church, has held
the premiership since Greenland won partial independence from
Denmark in 1979.
   About 53,000 people reside in Greenland, which has 840,000
square miles of territory, about 80 percent of it ice-covered.
   Motzfeldt allegedly used $9,000 of taxpayers' money on a
luxurious dinner in support of his own re-election as party leader,
the paper said.
   Bowing to opposition demands that his administration resign,
Motzfeldt set the vote for March 5.
   In the last ballot, in May 1987, Motzfeldt's Siumut Party and
the non-socialist opposition Atassut Party each won 11 mandates in
the 16-seat Landsting, or homerule parliament.
   Siumut formed a coalition with the leftist Inuit Ataqatigiit
party, which has one mandate.
   The conservative-leaning Issittup Party has four.

<TEXT>
   Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, the New York
state Legislature's most powerful Democrat, said Monday that he
expected to be indicted on federal felony charges.
   Miller said the indictment, expected later this week or next
week from U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney of Brooklyn, would charge
him with some form of mail fraud for his role in a real estate
transaction in 1983 and 1984.
   Miller denied any wrongdoing and said he would fight the
charges.
   Such an indictment would make Miller the second Democratic
legislative leader in Albany facing felony charges. State Senate
Minority Leader Manfred Ohrenstein of Manhattan is to go on trial
in February on state charges he hired ``no-show'' employees with
public funds.
   The charges against Miller, 51, involve his private law practice
and not his official duties as a state legislator, he said.
   Nonetheless, if he's convicted of a felony, Miller would be
automatically removed from the Brooklyn Assembly seat he has held
since 1970.
   ``The only thing I'm guilty of is being speaker of the New York
state Assembly. I have done nothing,'' Miller told a state Capitol
news conference Monday evening.
   ``We believe the crimes are being brought because I'm a very
nice victim and it would be wonderful to put my scalp in someone's
belt,'' he said.
   Maloney had no immediate comment.
   As speaker, Miller is one of the three most powerful officials
in state government and he has virtual veto power over any
legislation. He has been speaker since January 1987.
   Miller said he had informed Gov. Mario Cuomo and fellow
legislative leaders of the pending indictment earlier in the day.
   The Democratic leader said he didn't believe the charges that
would be brought against him represented a crime under state or
federal law.

   A stand-in for Mikhail Gorbachev, in
accepting the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize for him Monday, read a
statement by the Soviet president saying mankind has reached ``the
moment of truth.''
   Gorbachev said problems at home kept him from attending the Oslo
ceremony.
   In Stockholm, Sweden, King Carl XVI Gustaf handed out gold Nobel
Prize medallions and diplomas at a ceremony for the 10 laureates in
medicine, literature, physics, chemistry and economics.
   Literature prize winner Octavio Paz of Mexico received the
longest ovation from the crowd of 1,800 at Stockholm Concert Hall.
He later told a glittering banquet in the Swedish capital, ``We are
at the end of ideologies. We don't know what will be the face of
the future.
   ``But we do know that the environment is in danger. We need to
rediscover the feeling that the universe is a unity and that we are
a part of it.''
   The Swedish Academy cited Paz for ``impassioned writing with
wide horizons, characterized by sensuous intelligence and
humanistic integrity.''
   Each prize this year is worth 4 million kronor (about $715,000).
Sole winners get the whole amount. Multiple winners in one category
divide it. Checks are deposited electronically into the laureates'
bank accounts the day after the ceremony.
   The United States, which produced eight winners this year in
economics, physics and medicine, is the only country that taxes the
prize money.
   The winners at in Stockholm talked about the Earth's future and
paid tribute to their patients, students and co-workers in
accepting the awards for achievements that benefitted mankind.
   Gorbachev's acceptance speech was read by envoy Anatoly Kovalyov
in Oslo City Hall.
   Referring to the past ``unnatural division of Europe'' and to
Germany's recent unification, the Soviet leader wrote, ``We have
begun to resolutely tear down the material foundations of a
military, political and ideological confrontation.''
   He quoted 18th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant: ``Kant
prophesized that mankind would one day be faced with a dilemma:
either to be joined in a true union of nations or to perish in a
war of annihilation ending in the extinction of the human race.
   ``Now, as we move from the second to the third millennium, the
clock has struck the moment of truth.''
   In Moscow, Gorbachev said he regarded the 71st peace prize as
``a recognition of what we call perestroika and innovative
political thinking, which is of vital significance for human
destinies all over the world.''
   Protesters in Oslo, Stockholm and Moscow denounced the Norwegian
Nobel Committee's decision to award him the prize and complained
about violence,human rights violations and political restrictions
in the Soviet Union.
   Kovalyov said the $715,000 probably would be donated to worthy
causes.
   Joseph E. Murray of Milford, Mass., accepted the medicine prize
on behalf of himself and co-winner E. Donnall Thomas of Seattle,
whose pioneering work in bone marrow transplants led to a cure for
most childhood leukemia.
   Murray, who performed the first organ transplant, with kidneys,
in 1954, said: ``The prize pays tribute to the hundreds of patients
now living healthy lives. We are indebted to these patients who
have been unselfishly involved in this research.''
   Elias Corey of Cambridge, Mass., recipient of the chemistry
prize for discovering how to simulate organic synthesis in the
laboratory, made hundreds of medicines and other products easily
available and affordable.
   ``Chemistry can be applied to improve the life of man and make
life happier for all of us,'' Corey said.
   Richard E. Taylor of Medicine Hat, Alberta;, Jerome I. Friedman
of Chicago and Henry W. Kendall of Boston shared the physics prize
for experiments which helped prove the existence of subatomic
particles called quarks and increased knowledge about the basic
structure of the universe.
   ``There was great elation'' among financial economists over the
recognition of their field by this year's Nobel Memorial Prize in
Economics, said winner Harry M. Markowitz of New York. He spoke for
co-recipients Merton H. Miller of Chicago and William F. Sharpe of
Stanford University. The three were recognized for pioneering work
in the theory of financial economics and how markets function.
   The Nobel Prizes are awarded on the anniversary of the death of
Alfred Nobel, Swedish inventor of dynamite who established them in
his 1896 will. Sweden's Central Bank established the economics
prize in 1968.
   Gorbachev is the the third Eastern European who has not received
his prize in person since 1975. Poland's Lech Walesa won in 1983
and Soviet human rights champion Andrei Sakharov, now dead, won in
1975.

<TEXT>
   Interim Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara
said Tuesday he wants his island republic readmitted to the British
Commonwealth.
   Fiji was excluded from the Commonwealth in 1987 after a newly
elected, Indian-dominated government was overthrown by two military
coups. The Queen was replaced as head of state and a republic
declared.
   In an interview with the Fiji Times newspaper, Ratu Mara
criticized the Commonwealth's veto rules that allow one
member-state to determine whether others should be allowed to join
or be barred. He called for a ruling saying the majority of
Commonwealth countries should determine member applications.
   In a bitter diplomatic row, India has vowed to veto any re-entry
application in protest over a new constitution that favors
indigenous Fijians over other races, including ethnic Indians.
   Ratu Mara was quoted as saying that he would like to see Fiji
back in the Commonwealth fold.
   ``But I don't know how we could return because I don't know how
we were ousted from it,'' he said. ``I hope a system is devised
whereby the views of the majority of members determine whether a
new member is admitted or an old member returns.''
   Ethnic Indians, originally brought to Fiji by the colonial
British last century as indentured sugar plantation workers,
comprised a majority of Fiji's 720,000 population. But emigration
since then and two coups have left them a minority.

<TEXT>
   Fresh conflicts between Arizona's two senators
surfaced Monday at ethics hearings on the relationship between five
senators and former S&amp;L owner Charles H. Keating Jr.
   A former employee of Keating testified before the Senate Ethics
Committee that Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz. called him and
expressed keen interest in critical comments the executive made
about Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
   The ex-employee, David E. Stevens, wrote the committee last
October that McCain had never intended to reimburse Keating's
company for his wife's cost of trips the couple took on Keating's
corporate airplanes.
   Monday, Stevens said of this and other critical statements in
his letter, ``I wish I had written these differently.''
   Stevens, who handled tax matters for Keating's American
Continental Corp., said DeConcini was sent a copy of the letter and
called him at home on Nov. 26.
   DeConcini asked whether an affidavit could be prepared based on
his letter.
   ``He said that he wasn't using my letter to hurt McCain and, in
fact, he didn't think the letter would hurt him,'' Stevens said in
an written account of his converstion with DeConcini released by
the committee.
   Stevens also said, in his testimony Monday, that DeConcini
asked, ``Would you mind if I released this to the press?''
   The letter in fact did reach the press, although Stevens said
the matter of public release was left unresolved in his
conversation with Deconcini.
   The trips by McCain and his wife on Keating's planes from
1984-86 have not figured prominently so far in hearings on the five
senators' assistance to Keating and interventions with S&amp;L
regulators on his behalf. McCain reimbursed Keating's American
Continental Corp. for the trips in 1989 and was cleared of
wrongdoing by the House and Senate ethics committees.
   The trips were made when McCain was a member of the House.
   Earlier in the hearings, aides to both senators gave much
different accounts of conversations between the lawmakers just
before they participated in crucial meetings with thrift
regulator's on Keating's behalf in 1987. Other subjects of the
ethics probe are Sens. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., John Glenn,
D-Ohio and Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   Before Stevens testified, former U.S. customs commissioner
William Von Raab told the committee that senators often intervened
with him on behalf of constituents.
   Von Raab testified for Sen. Dennis DeConcini, one of five
senators under investigation for intervening with thrift regulators
on behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr.
   Asked by committee member Warren Rudman, R-N.H. ``where you
would draw that line'' of unacceptable conduct by senators, von
Raab replied: ``If someone tried to bribe me.''
   DeConcini was the only one of the five senators present as von
Raab testified that lawmakers often asked him to grant waivers for
constituents and to reconsider regulations.
   The committee held its 15th day of hearings on the relationship
between the five senators and Keating, who with associates
contributed $1.3 million to the lawmakers' campaigns and causes.
   The five senators asked thrift regulators in 1987 to reconsider
a regulation limiting risky investments such as those undertaken by
Keating's failing Lincoln Savings and Loan, of Irvine, Calif.
   Lincoln was seized in April 1989 at a potential cost to
taxpayers of more than $2 billion.
   Regulators testified that DeConcini sought to negotiate a waiver
of the rule for Lincoln and used the word ``we'' to indicate he was
speaking for the other senators.
   Regulators contend that DeConcini improperly negotiated on
Keating's behalf at that meeting.
   Von Raab said he had never been confronted by lawmakers under
the exact circumstances as those faced by banking regulators when
the five senators met with them in April 1987.
   Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett noted that those
meetings were held without aides, on behalf of a single constituent
- Lincoln - which already had been found in violation of the rule
on direct investments.
   ``All you have said is Sen. DeConcini is a friend f yours and
all of your dealings with him have been honorable and
appropriate,'' committee member Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., told von
Raab.
   Von Raab said there were circumstances when lawmakers had
intervened with him for constituents seeking reduction of fines and
waiver of regulations for constituents.
   ``I never felt intervention ... seeking one of those results ...
had been improper,'' he said.
   Other witnesses testified in DeConcini's defense, describing
help he provided for law enforcement, drug-treatment projects and
disabled veterans. They said he acted without regard to campaign
contributions.
   ``I could not imagine how he could have done anything more,''
said Rod Mullin, who runs Amity Inc., a Tuscon-based assistance
program for the poor.

<HEAD>Pre-Columbus Site Discovered on St. Thomas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bulldozers at an island
construction zone on St. Thomas have unearthed an achaeological
site that could date to 900 years before Columbus first visited the
Virgin Islands.
   Archaeologist Elizabeth Righter and volunteers from the National
Park Service in Atlanta are carefully documenting the dig, and
indications are it is about 1,400 years old.
   ``It's getting more extraordinary by the minute,'' Righter said
Monday. ``We're finding much more than we ever dared to hope.''
   Finds thus far have revealed two skeletons, food remains, a
possible ball court and handicrafts.
   Preliminary examination of the skeletons indicates the man and
woman were about 4-foot, 7-inches tall, and stocky with
well-developed shoulders.
   Righter speculates they hiked the island's steep hills to and
from the sea, carrying loads on their shoulders.
   Righter said the food remains are important because they contain
charcoal and pottery. The charcoal can be carbon-dated to fix a
more-precise time for each layer of the settlement.
   Food remains indicate a diet of crab, whelks, reef fish, turtle
and cassava bread.
   The ball court is the first to be found on St. Thomas. Righter
says pieces of what may be stone collars worn around the
ballplayers' hips to hit the ball in a soccer-like game, have been
found.
   Elaborately carved shell ornaments and finely crafted pottery,
similar to what is now in Venezuela, are also among the ruins.
   Planning and Natural Resources Earth Change Inspector, Tom
Linnio first discovered signs of the village during a routine
inspection after inland property was cleared for the shopping area.
   Righter has been operating from donations, including those from
the development owner, William Mahaffey, Virgin Islands Telephone
Corp., Gassett Motors and St. Thomas Historic Trust.
   Labor has been donated by the Virgin Islands National Guard.
National Park archaeologists are donating their time, as are
members of the St. Thomas Historic Trust, the Explorer's Club and
the St. Thomas-St. John Environmental Association.
   Meanwhile, the construction project is on hold until exploration
is completed. Mahaffey said he will display a replica of the
village in a 30-foot glass rotunda in the middle of the completed
mall.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Monday began
transfering home hundreds of southern Sudanese who had been living
in shantytowns around the capital, hoping to escape a civil war and
food shortage.
   A train carrying 619 displaced people took off Monday for the
western town of Babanousa, where the passengers will be transported
by road to their homes in southern Sudan, the official Sudan News
Agency said.
   The agency quoted Brig. Mohamed Osman, the governor of the
capital Khartoum, as saying ``the reasons behind their displacement
have now disappeared,'' and urged the returnees to go back home and
start producing their own food.
   The displaced people poured in over the past few years, setting
up shantytowns around Khartoum to escape the civil war in the south
and the subsequent food shortages.
   The agency said the passengers all left on their own free will.
It said the government has arranged for trains to move them out of
Khartoum every two weeks.
   The government has denied earlier claims that it was forcing the
displaced people to return to the war-torn south.
   In other parts of Sudan, authorities are discouraging the
establishment of refugee camps where thousands have recently
arrived, escaping a famine. The government is apparently trying to
avoid a repetition of Sudan's 1984-85 tragedy when thousands died
in camps from lack of adequate food and medicines.
   Thousands of people fleeing hunger in the western region of
Kordofan arrived at a camp near the regional capital, el-Obeid.
They are to be given a month's supply of food and sent home.
   A drought and consequent famine have struck most of the country,
affecting up to 7 million of its 25 million people, and worse is
expected within six months.

   More than 10,000 teachers and parents
on Monday stood in pouring rain in front of the Home Affairs
Ministry to protest what they called inadequate budget allocations
for 1991.
   The rally was called by the Teachers' Federation to underline
widespread anxiety about how budget cutbacks may threaten the
quality of teaching.
   ``The teachers are demonstrating for the children,'' Mrs. Istvan
Szoelloesi, general secretary of the Federation, told the Hungarian
news agency MTI.
   She rejected charges that the teachers were only seeking pay
raises.
   ``Teachers are only one component of teaching. But to keep
kindergartens and schools open, you need heat and light, and in
some places the money for these things will soon run out.''
   Parliament on Tuesday is to begin debate on the 1991 budget. The
draft budget calls for a $1.3 billion deficit.

<HEAD>High Profile Week Begins for Daily News, Including Mediation in
Washington</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News and its unions said Monday they
will go to Washington this week for a federal effort to mediate a
bitter 6-week-old strike.
   Both sides accepted the invitation of the director of the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to meet with him.
   Negotiations have been going on since the beginning of the year
on contracts that expired in March. The talks with the unions
continued after the strike began Oct. 25 amid violence.
   James F. Power, a spokesman for the mediation service in
Washington, said, ``Right now we feel quite happy we are getting
them under the same roof. There's no way to say how these things
are going to evolve.''
   The Allied Printing Trades Council, the umbrella of the nine
unions striking the paper, is to meet with the service's director,
Bernard DeLury, Wednesday. DeLury will meet separately with
management.
   The News says that by the end of this year its losses over the
past decade will have mounted to about $200 million and that it
must have major concessions to operate profitably. The unions say
they might be able to grant some relief but that the ``management
rights'' provisions sought by the paper are too broad.
   The board of the Tribune Co., the Daily News' parent company,
was scheduled to meet Tuesday in Chicago to discuss the strike.
Also Tuesday, a U.S. Senate hearing will be held in New York on the
issue of hiring replacement workers during a strike, said Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   On Monday afternoon, Gov. Mario Cuomo, the Rev. Jesse Jackson
and Cardinal John O'Connor addressed a union rally of 6,500 across
the street from the paper's offices. Police reported no incidents.
   ``The whole world is watching us ... as they watched Eastern. It
has to come out better this time,'' Cuomo said, referring to the
union struggle of the strikers at Eastern Airlines.
   The paper has printed daily since the strike began, although its
circulation has dropped from 1.09 million to 552,000 as of last
week. The use of more than 1,600 hawkers has helped the Daily News
regain some of the circulation lost when large numbers of vendors
refused to sell it.
   In another development Monday, unions representing transit
workers said they would make sure the paper's hawkers complied with
restrictions placed on them by a judge in allowing them to sell the
Daily News on subway platforms.
   U.S. District Court Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum ordered that there
be no more than three hawkers at each station and that they remain
within 10 feet of any existing newsstand, newspaper rack or
newspaper vending machine not displaying or offering the News.

<HEAD>Jury Recommends Life Sentence for Doctor Convicted of
Identity-Switch Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury recommended Monday that a doctor
convicted of murder in an insurance fraud case serve life in prison
without the possibility of parole.
   Dr. Richard Boggs, 57, was ordered back to court Feb. 1 for
sentencing by Superior Court Judge Florence Marie Cooper.
   Boggs was convicted July 12 on nine felonies, including the 1988
slaying of Ellis Henry Greene. That jury deadlocked in the penalty
phase and a new jury was empaneled to decide whether the doctor
should serve life in prison or death in the gas chamber.
   Prosecutors claimed Boggs and the two owners of the troubled
Just Sweats sports apparel company of Ohio, Melvin E. Hanson and
John B. Hawkins, conspired to switch Greene's identity with
Hanson's in an effort to collect life insurance.
   The prosecution said Boggs lured Greene from a bar to his
medical office in April 1988 and suffocated him, although the cause
of death was never conclusively proved through medical evidence.
   Boggs misdentified the body as Hanson and Hawkins had the body
cremated the following day. Hanson's credit cards and birth
certificate were found with the body.
   Hanson and Hawkins allegedly shared a $1.5 million insurance
payoff and Boggs got $6,500, prosecutors said.
   Hanson, who had facial plastic surgery, fled to Mexico but was
captured when he returned and is awaiting trial. Hawkins remains at
large.
   Boggs insisted he didn't kill Greene. He claimed Hanson
threatened to expose his homosexuality and ruin his practice in
Glendale if he refused to sign a phony death certificate
identifying the dead Greene as Hanson.

<HEAD>Japanese Journalist Returns to Earth Feeling Heavy But Hungry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyohiro Akiyama's legs seemed like strangers to
him when he returned to Earth on Monday after eight days as the
first journalist and the first Japanese in space. He had not,
however, not forgotten his fondness for beer.
   Akiyama, 48, told Japanese television viewers from his landing
site in the Soviet Union, ``It seems like I came back as a mass of
desire.''
   Otherwise, he said, after the weightlessness of life in space,
he felt ``heavy, heavy. I thought I could stand, but I felt I have
no legs.''
   Akiyama rode back to Earth in a Soyuz space capsule with Soviet
cosmonauts Gennadi Manakov and Gennadi Strekalov, who were winding
up a four-month stay aboard the Mir space station.
   Akiyama is a news director for Tokyo Broadcasting System, which
paid the Soviets $12 million for his rocket ride and short stay at
the space station, and spent an additional $25 million on the
project. It expects to lose $7.4 million on the venture, even after
firguring in advertising revenues and proceeds from documentaries
and lectures by Akiyama.
   TBS showed exclusive live telecasts from their astro-reporter
each night during his Odyssey, which enjoyed high ratings. He
expressed concern about global pollution he viewed from orbit. He
even recited Japanese haiku poetry.
   The newsman was mobbed by TBS reporters upon emerging, waving
and smiling from the capsule. They sped to the landing site - the
frozen tundra in Kazakstan republic in Central Asia - to beam live
to Japan his thoughts upon arriving back on Earth.
   ``Yes, it's very beautiful,'' he said when asked how it felt to
be back.
   TBS then arranged for Akiyama to speak to his wife Kyoko, who
watched the landing from the company's Tokyo studios.
   ``I'm back,'' said Akiyama, wrapped in a parka and with his
space helmet still in place.
   ``I worried a bit,'' replied his wife.
   ``Did the kids do all right on their exams?'' he asked.
   ``Why ask such things now?'' she said.
   ``I want to eat something good.''
   ``I've prepared it,'' his wife reassured him.
   Akiyama told viewers, ``My body was in a state of
weightlessness, say, about one hour ago. That is to say my body,
including brain and stomach, was in a condition like floating.
   ``Now everything is being attracted downward. I think I can
easily raise my legs, but I have a strange feeling that I must form
an intention to do so.''
   He said it seemed like he was feeling weight and air for the
first time.
   TBS devoted the entire day to covering events surrounding his
landing, which came at about 3:05 p.m. local time.
   The network rented four helicopters. When a reporter from one
copter spotted the capsule plummeting to Earth, he yelled, ``I see
it! I see it! It's there! It's there!''
   Reporters were at the site less than 10 minutes after touchdown.
   His voyage began Dec. 2 with liftoff from Baikonur Cosmodrome,
about 1,300 miles east of Moscow. He and two Soviet cosmonauts
linked up with Mir Tuesday.
   He took with him six Japanese tree frogs, to test how they adapt
to weightlessness.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told reporters the mission was
``significant for success in Soviet-Japanese cooperation. I expect
this to a produce a very good influence.''
   Having a paying passenger aboard was a major step in Soviet
efforts to commercialize their space program.
   Japanese corporate sponsors, including a diaper maker and a
toothpaste company, had their logos and names plastered on the
rocket that launched Akiyama into space.

   More than 150 freed American hostages on Monday returned to
joyful homecomings, but hopes of peace raised by their release were
dimmed by tough statements frm both sides in the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Despite its decision to free the thousands of foreign captives,
the Baghdad government made its most bellicose statement in weeks
on Kuwait, saying it would ``not compromise one iota'' in its claim
to the emirate it seized on Aug. 2.
   President Bush, in a Washington speech proclaiming Monday as
Human Rights Day, denounced the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait as a
``systematic assault on the soul of a nation.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, meanwhile, said Iraq's move to
free the foreigners should not create unrealistic expectations
about a resolution to the gulf crisis. He also said Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein deserved no particular praise for deciding to end
his ``abhorrent'' hostage holding.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, however, complained that
Iraqis were confused by the hard-line statements from U.S.
officials following the hostage release.
   ``We thought ... that this unanimous decision on the part of my
president would create a positive atmosphere,'' said Aziz in an
interview Monday with Cable News Network.
   Even as the freed hostages were streaming out of Iraq, more and
more military forces converged on the gulf region.
   France announced it would increase its troops by an unspecified
number, and Cheney said Saddam had been sending in reinforcements
in recent days.
   Despite the continued talk of war, there was little that could
dampen the hostages' joy at coming home. A Pan American flight from
Frankfurt, Germany, arrived at Andrews Air Force Base outside
Washington late Monday afternoon with 152 Americans and four
Canadians.
   Those aboard the military-chartered flight had flown out of
Baghdad the day before, the first Americans to go free under an
Iraqi decree releasing all foreign hostages. Some in that group
were taking later flights home.
   At the Frankfurt stopover, many appeared thin and tired after
their 4{-month ordeal in captivity.
   ``It was like a gulag,'' said 58-year-old Robert Vinton of Santa
Fe., N.M., who was held south of Baghdad at an oil refinery.
   Provisions on board the U.S.-bound flight included Big Macs and
champagne, U.S. officials said.
   At Andrews, the former hostages appeared tired but most smiled
as they left the plane. Relatives in the crowd held up signs,
including one that said, ``Daddy, Daddy, I Need You.''
   The group got on three buses to be taken to a processing area
and made no public comments.
   Another 123 British, Australian and Irish citizens arrived in
London aboard two flights from Rome and Frankfurt.
   ``I feel euphoric,'' said freed British hostage Harvey May.
   Australian Steve Hicking proposed to his girlfriend when she met
him at London's Heathrow Airport. She said yes.
   Also, 384 Westerners, about 227 of them Britons, left Baghdad
aboard a British-chartered flight on Monday. Diplomats said some
Americans were aboard but were unable to give an immediate
breakdown.
   U.S. officials said they planned to charter another flight from
Baghdad in three or four days to evacuate the rest of the estimated
750 Americans in Iraq and Kuwait. Britain said it hoped to fly out
another 320 Britons and others on Tuesday.
   Saddam said Thursday that all the foreign hostages could leave.
About 8,000 Westerners had been trapped since the invasion of
Kuwait, including about 600 held at strategic sites as ``human
shields'' against possible attack by the U.S.-dominated
multinational force.
   A rapid U.S. buildup of that force is in progress, aimed at
bringing troop strength in the region to 400,000 by mid-January.
That coincides with the Jan. 15 deadline the U.N. Security Council
gave Saddam for getting out of Kuwait or facing possible military
action.
   Word of the French decision to send in more troops came from
Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who said the size of the
increase would be announced later. France currently has about 6,200
army and air force troops in Saudi Arabia, where most of the
multinational force is deployed.
   Iraq is building up its forces too, Cheney told a defense
industry group in Washington. Even as Saddam freed hostages, Cheney
said, ``he has simultaneously continued to build up his deployments
in Kuwait, to enhance his fortifications and to add additional
forces to the regions.''
   The defense secretary said despite the release of the hostages,
Saddam ``has given us absolutely no indication whatsoever of any
intention'' of withdrawing from Kuwait.
   The latest show of Iraqi defiance on that point came from the
Baghdad government's information minister Latif Jassim, who said
any notion of an Iraqi withdrawal was ``nothing but dreams and
wishful thinking.''
   ``Kuwait is Iraqi, whether in the past, present or future,'' he
said in a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency. ``We
will not compromise one iota on Kuwaiti territory.''
   Some weekend reports had said Iraq had redrawn its border with
Kuwait in possible preparation for a partial pullout.
   The reports, in the Observer of London and the Al-Khaleej daily
in Abu Dhabi, said Saddam's aim was to keep the entire Rumailah
oilfield and two islands, Warba and Bubiyan, which would give it
access to the Persian Gulf.
   The oilfield, which lies chiefly in Iraq, extends two miles into
Kuwait and Saddam accused Kuwait of overexploiting it before he
invaded.
   Also Monday, Coretta Scott King was at the United Nations with a
coalition of peace activists trying to organize nationwide peace
demonstrations on Jan. 15.
   That is the deadline in the U.N. resolution calling on Iraq to
get out of Kuwait. It is also the birthdate of Mrs. King's husband,
slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``We will not tolerate making this a day of war and military
aggression,'' she said.
   In other developments:
   -Crude oil prices rose 32 cents Monday to close at $26.90 per
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   -The Pentagon said it is sending more F-15 Eagle fighter planes
to the gulf. Elements of the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing at Bitburg,
Germany, will deploy starting Dec. 28. It did not say how many
planes will go. A tactical fighter wing normally would include
about 70 aircraft. An undisclosed number of F-15s was sent to the
gulf in August.
   The Army on Monday also announced it was ordered to active duty
1,457 members of National Guard and Reserve units in 20 states. The
activations brought to 120,281 the number of reservists called to
active duty in all four services.

<HEAD>Stasi Allegations Build Against Last East German Leader</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   German news media on Monday reported links
between a former East German secret police officer and Lothar de
Maiziere, the nation's last leader and now a member of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Cabinet.
   The reports identifying de Maiziere's ``control officer''
followed an earlier media allegation that de Maiziere worked for
the now-disbanded secret police, known as the Stasi.
   Kohl spokesman Hans Klein said the chancellor was ``reserving
judgment'' until a full probe is completed. De Maiziere now is a
minister-without-portfolio in the Cabinet.
   De Maiziere has repeatedly denied the allegations. He guided
East Germany to unity with West Germany on Oct. 3 and was his
nation's only democratically elected leader.
   The scandal broke over the weekend after Der Spiegel magazine
said an index card in Stasi files contained the ``cover name'' of a
Stasi informer and de Maiziere's address in former East Berlin.
   Another news magazine, Stern, and the newspaper Bild reported
Monday they had found de Maiziere's reputed ``control officer,''
identified as former Stasi Maj. Edgar Hasse.
   Bild quoted the man as saying, ``I was his (de Maiziere's)
control officer. I met with de Maiziere regularly.''
   Stern said it has found other former Stasi employees who also
claim that de Maiziere had been an important informer.
   Stern quoted Hasse as saying he recruited de Maiziere, then an
attorney, in 1982.
   Hasse claimed de Maiziere provided the Stasi with information
about East German church leaders, the magazine reported. De
Maiziere had close contacts with Lutheran Church officials.
   Stern telexed copies of its report to other news media in
advance of Thursday's publication.
   Stern said Eberhard Jaekel, identified as another former Stasi
officer, also claims that de Maiziere had been an informer.
   But the issue is complicated by Stasi files' being kept under
lock and key in former East Berlin. Under the unification treaty,
access to the files is tightly controlled because of their highly
sensitive nature.
   Kohl's government has asked the official who safeguards the
files, Joachim Gauck, to examine them as part of the probe.
   De Maiziere's friends and political allies on Monday said they
believe his denials.
   ``I'll believe Mr. de Maiziere before I believe a former Stasi
officer,'' said Otto Lambsdorff, head of the Free Democrats, junior
partners in Kohl's coalition.
   Volker Ruehe, general secretary of Kohl's Christian Democrats,
said the party believes de Maiziere ``until there is proof to the
contrary.''

   Prosecutors dropped criminal charges Monday
against a record store owner who sold the 2 Live Crew album ``As
Nasty As They Wanna Be,'' saying they couldn't prove the sexually
explicit lyrics were obscene.
   Dave Risher's trial was about to begin when Bexar County
Court-At-Law Judge Tony Jimenez III dismissed the charges at the
prosecutors' request. He also asked sternly why it took them six
months to come up empty-handed.
   ``I think that the (district attorney's) office owes Mr. Risher
an apology,'' he said. When he dismissed the court, spectators
clapped and cheered.
   Risher was charged after Patrick Weaver, son of the president of
Citizens Against Pornography, bought the album at Hogwild Records
and Tapes in June and then complained to police it was obscene. The
album includes references to oral and anal sex and sexual violence
against women.
   The case apparently fell apart when Weaver listened to the album
last Friday with the prosecutors and decided it didn't violate
state obscenity laws. Expert witnesses also told prosecutors they
weren't sure the rap album's contents met the state's test for
obscenity.
   ``Taken as a whole, he (Weaver) did not feel that this album was
obscene,'' Hancock said afterward. ``That is a weakness in our
case. We obviously felt that trying the case would have been an
injustice.''
   Among other criteria, material can only be called obscene in
Texas if it is found by a reasonable person to be without literary,
artistic or political value.
   Weaver, 20, declined to be interviewed later. But his mother,
Teresa Weaver, said in a call to their home that ``as much as he
wanted to address was already addressed.''
   ``I thought we were going to trial today. I'm pleasantly
surprised,'' said Risher, who had been charged with promotion of
pornography. The misdemeanor carries a maximum penalty of a year in
prison and a $1,000 fine.
   ``I can't wait to get back to work,'' said Risher, owner of
Hogwild Records and Tapes.
   Risher was charged after San Antonio vice officers visited
record stores and told owners that a federal judge in Florida had
found the album obscene. After that ruling, a Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., record owner was convicted of a misdemeanor obscenity charge.
Members of the Miami-based rap group were acquitted, however, of
similar charges that followed a live performance in Hollywood, Fla.
   After the obscenity declaration in Florida, officers here asked
store operators to sign statements saying they had been given the
warning. Risher refused.
   Days after the warning, Patrick Weaver, whose mother is
president of an anti-pornography group, bought the album at
Risher's store and filed a complaint with police.
   ``I can't wait to get back to work,'' said Risher, owner of
Hogwild Records and Tapes.
   There was no immediate reaction from 2 Live Crew to Monday's
dismissal.

   More than 150 Americans who
had been trapped in Iraq and Kuwait arrived in the United States
Monday for a holiday homecoming after four harrowing months spent
as hostages or in hiding.
   The 152 American and four Canadians were greeted by a small but
cheering crowd as they streamed off a charter flight at Andrews Air
Force Base outside Washington.
   They appeared tired but most smiled as they left the plane,
waving to the greeting party. Relatives in the crowd held up signs,
including one that said, ``Daddy, Daddy, I Need You.''
   Most of the group carried luggage; many wore casual clothes and
were ill-prepared for the chilly evening weather.
   One woman was in a wheelchair.
   The group declined to speak with reporters at Andrews, but some
individuals spoke freely at a hotel later.
   ``I was damned mad about the whole thing,'' said Jack Rinehart,
37, of Stover, Mo., an electrical engineer.
   Rinehart, a designer of air-conditioner motors, spent almost the
entire time in the U.S. Embassy at Kuwait City where he said he was
``camp plumber'' and lost 25 pounds on a diet of tuna and rice.
   Dwight Durmon of Fayetteville, Tenn., said he was not mistreated
in Iraq. But ``people are scared in Iraq,'' he said, clutching the
hand of his wife, Kathy.
   ``Everybody has mental stress coming out of there,'' said
Durmon, who declined to say what he did in Iraq.
   Both Durmon and Rinehart said President Bush was doing well in
the crisis, Rinehart observing, ``I think George Bush and the
administration have handled this beautifully.''
   William Armbruster, a press officer for the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait who worked at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad after Aug. 23,
said one Iraqi citizen told him, ``Tell George Bush that whatever
he is doing has got to be done.
   In an interview with CBS News, Ed Wener of Baltimore said he and
four other people stayed indoors in Kuwait. ``We would have to
travel from house to hoiuse once in a while, though, when we heard
the Iraqis were in the neighborhood.''
   Werner said he saw a Kuwaiti man fire at Iraqi soldiers and
``about 20 Iraqi soldiers just opened up on him,'' killing him.
   The jet carried hamburgers and champagne for the evacuees who
had their first big breakfast in months on Monday.
   The Americans had flown from Frankfurt, Germany, where they had
spent the night after arriving in Europe from Baghdad, Iraq. The
State Department said 73 people remained in Frankfurt for medical
treatment or because they wanted to make their own way home.
   U.S. officials said a second plane chartered by the Pentagon was
to evacuate more Americans from Iraq and Kuwait on Tuesday.
   Ivan Selin, the undersecretary of State for management, along
with Elizabeth Tamposi, the assistant secretary of state for
consular affairs, greeted the evacuees.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was cautiously optimistic
about the release of more hostages, many of whom had been held as
``human shields'' at strategic locations in Iraq.
   Iraq's parliament approved the release of 8,000 American,
European and Japanese hostages on Friday at the request of
President SAddam Hussein. The hostages were trapped when Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``We've got one plane here and another on the way,'' Fitzwater
said. But he did not know if any Americans were still being held
against their will.
   ``The president's initial statement of `I'll believe it when I
see it' still stands,'' Fitzwater said. The Iraqis, he added, were
still ``totally in control.''
   Fitzwater declined to give any precise numbers of how many
Americans remain in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``This is kind of a touchy question,'' he said. ``We'd prefer
the Iraqis don't know exactly how many people we had there.''
   In Frankfurt, the former hostages told reporters they were glad
to be free.
   ``It was like a gulag,'' said Robert Vinton of Santa Fe, N.M. He
was picked up on Aug. 18 on a street in Baghdad and held at an oil
refinery.
   Vinton, 58, said he was held with eight other foreigners. ``We
were mostly left alone,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mayor Says New York City Faces New $250 Million Budget Gap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins said Monday the city has
found yet another shortfall in its current budget, adding $250
million to the ever-growing shortage.
   He blamed cuts in state aid and the weakening economy.
   Dinkins just recently closed a $388 million gap inthe 1991
fiscal year budget, which ends June 30.
   Asked at a news conference in City Hall how he would close the
new projected gap, the mayor answered that it will take ``more
pain.'' He indicated he might have to turn to a contingency plan he
developed while planning the earlier cut, but that totals only $40
million.
   The plan includes the closing of six firehouses and cutbacks in
refuse collection, funding for senior citizen centers and food
pantries, elimination of a nutrition program and some day care
staff advisers, plus delays in bridge inspection and repair
programs as well as maintenance at parks, playgrounds and beaches.
   Dinkins disclosed the possible new gap in the $28 billion budget
after attending a meeting with the Standard &amp; Poor's bond rating
agency. The agency has already put the city on a credit watch and
is to evaluate a municipal long-term bond issue of $1.3 billion
Wednesday.
   Deputy Mayor Sally Hernandez Piniero said S&amp;P currently rates
city bonds as A-minus. She said Moody's rates them at A.
   Dinkins said he assured S&amp;P executives that the city, which
underwent a fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s, has acted responsibly
in balancing its budget for years.
   He said that the city has closed $1.8 billion in holes in its
budget during his term and that of former Mayor Edward I. Koch in
the latter part of 1989.
   The mayor said he hoped that S&amp;P would maintain the city's
current rating at least until he presents his preliminary budget
for the 1992 fiscal year, which starts July 1. That budget already
has a $1.3 billion gap that the mayor said he plans to fill as
well.

<HEAD>U.S. Urges Hanoi, Phomn Penh to Accept Settlement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States warned Vietnam Monday that
resisting the major-power formula for ending the Cambodian civil
war endorsed by the United Nations would hurt its prospects for
normal diplomatic relations with the United States.
   `Hanoi's own interests ... would be best served by supporting
rather than resisting the progress made toward a Cambodian
settlement,'' Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon told a
subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee
   Although Vietnam has made some statements expressing willingness
to support the U.N.-backed formula, ``other statements are at best
ambiguous or put forward positions in basic opposition,'' Solomon
told the subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs.
   Solomon said Hanoi should ``reexamine its position'' and
influence the Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia to accept
the settlement drafted by the United States, Soviet Union, China,
Britain and France, the five permament U.N. Security Council
members, and recently endorsed by the Council and General Assembly.
   In answer to questions, Solomon said it was ``inconceivable''
that the Bush administration would normalize relations with Vietnam
or the government in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, if the U.N. peace plan
is scuttled.
   American business groups have been pressing for ending the U.S.
trade embargo against Vietnam. Hanoi has sought normalization to
bolster its weak economy. Solomon reaffirmed the U.S.
``long-standing policy that normalization of relations with Vietnam
can occur only in the context of an acceptable comprehensive
settlement of the Cambodian conflict.''
   The hearing heard Solomon's assessments of a decline in the
prospects for early peace and prevention of a return to power of
the communist Khmer Rouge, blamed for more than one million
Cambodian deaths in 1975-78.
   ``Unfortunately, the Phonm Penh regime has recently issued a
series of statements opposing basic tenets of the current draft
settlement ... only the Khmer Rouge are likely to benefit'' if the
plan is scuttled, Solomon said.
   Solomon represented the United States in drafting the Big Five
formula providing for a United Nations presence to organize free
elections, temporarily oversee government and disarm the Southeast
Asian country's warring factions.
   Phonm Penh leaders demanded that the U.N. presence last less
than a year and be limited to organizing an election, leaving their
powers unaffected, Solomon said. ``A fair and workable settlement
cannot be achieved on this basis,'' he added.
   ``At worst ... once again in the control of the Khmer Rouge,
Cambodia may yet again be transformed into an Asian Auschwitz,''
said subcommittee Chairman Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-NY, referring to
the notorious Nazi extermination camp where millions perished in
World War II.
   ``Unfortunately, there appears a very real reason to believe
this (plan) may not be accepted,'' he added, referring to
disagreement among the Cambodian factions and the recent statements
from Phonm Penh. Even at best, Solarz said, Cambodia could ``end up
like the Lebanon of Southeast Asia.''
   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kenneth Quinn said the Khmer
Rouge were ``regaining some popularity'' using Cambodian animosity
against the Vietnamese as a guerrilla recruiting tool. With time on
the side of the Khmer Rouge, Hanoi and Phomh Penh could serve their
own interests by accepting a settlement providing for
internationally enforced disarmament, he said.

   The Security Council on Monday again
postponed a meeting to discuss a resolution endorsing a Middle East
peace conference.
   The council meeting, already delayed several times at U.S.
request, was put off until Wednesday.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is scheduled to meet
Tuesday with President Bush, and Western diplomats said the United
States was seeking to avoid a vote until after Shamir leaves the
country on Thursday.
   The United States seeks to water down reference to the
conference, opposed by Israeli because it would emcompass the issue
of Palestinians in Israeli-occupied lands.
   The United States wants mention of the proposed conference moved
from the heart of a resolution to a non-binding preamble and
presidential statement.
   The United States also opposed any language in the resolution
that could suggest it is linked to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
calls for a Mideast conference to help settle the Persian Gulf
crisis. U.S. officials have indicated they may veto the draft
resolution unless significant changes were made.
   The United States has been caught in a diplomatic dilemma. It is
pressured by its Israeli ally to veto the measure any reference to
a U.N. conference. But U.S. officials also fear a veto could weaken
support from Arab nations that joined the coalition against Iraq
following its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The council voted 9-4 to adopt a Soviet motion to delay the
session.
   The United States had pushed for postponement, while France and
China abstained. Cuba, Colombia, Malaysia and Yemen opposed any
delay and sought an immediate vote.
   Any of the five permanent Security Council members - the United
States, France, Britain, Soviet Union and China - can veto a
measure.

   Small hills of bagged garbage began to crowd
sidewalks in parts of Manhattan on Monday, the first day of a
strike by workers employed by private haulers.
   Residential garbage collection is performed by the New York City
Sanitation Department and was not affected by the strike. If
accumulating garbage becomes a health or fire hazard, however, the
agency will make emergency pickups.
   A 2,100-member Teamsters local called the strike after union
members rejected a new contract raising wages $70 over three years.
The workers now earn $600 to $700 a week and sought a $90 raise.
   Union leader Bernard Adelstein said the strike was generally
effective in all five city boroughs, although in the Bronx ``a few
trucks went out with scabs.''
   Salvatore Spinelli, a spokesman for the private carters, said
about 30 percent of trucks were operating throughout the city,
staffed by management and non-striking crews. Some replacement
workers might also have been hired, he said.
   About 400 private carters collect 10,000 tons of garbage daily
from 250,000 business and commercial sites in New York City.
   At least one hauler hired security guards to follow his trucks
on their route in case of trouble, but Police spokesman Detective
Joseph McConville said no strike-related violence was reported.
   No talks were scheduled. Both sides said the next step was up to
the city's labor negotiator, Eric Schmertz, who has been working on
the dispute.
   On Monday the most conspicuous uncollected piles of garbage were
in midtown Manhattan, mostly on side streets by fast-food outlets,
large movie theaters and restaurants with high turnover.
   If health or fire inspectors decide the uncollected garbage is
dangerous, city sanitation crews will pick it up and charge the
customers $14.70 per cubic yard. That's the rate the city permits
private carters to charge.
   Consumer Affairs Commissioner Mark Green, whose agency regulates
hauling rates, has recommended that the current fee be cut by about
$1 a cubic yard.
   Both the union and the private carters accused Green of helping
precipitate the strike.
   Green said the workers and employers could ``search for
scapegoats, but any failure in their negotiation is not due to my
rate.''
   New York City's private garbage collectors, a $1 billion service
industry, were last struck for 17 days in 1981.

<TEXT>
   North Korean Prime Minister Yon Hyong
Muk crossed the heavily armed border into South Korea on Tuesday
for a third round of talks on easing four decades of confrontation.
   ``Welcome, welcome,'' the South's unification minister, Hong
Sung-chul, said in greeting him at the border village of Panmunjom,
35 miles north of Seoul.
   ``How are you?'' replied Yon, smiling broadly. He bent down to
allow a little girl to place a wreath of flowers over his head,
then posed for pictures and waved at onlookers.
   Talks between Yon and South Korean Prime Minister Kang
Young-hoon will take place Wednesday and Thursday. They are the
third round in as many months of the highest level meetings ever
held between the two Koreas.
   The talks are not expected to produce a major agreement, but are
seen as a step in the lengthy process of drawing closer. The rival
Koreas have been divided since 1945.
   ``Small, steady efforts and finally little gains ... will lead
to quantitative change,'' said Limb Dong-won, a diplomat and
spokesman for the South's delegation.
   The agenda, basically the same as in past talks, calls for
exchanges and easing political and military tensions. The North
wants a non-aggression pact and the South claims confidence
building agreements are needed first.
   The South also will press for official recognition of each
other's governments. The North has maintained formal recognition
would perpetuate division of the peninsula.
   Midway in the prime ministers' talks, the South's President Roh
Tae-woo says will fly to Moscow for a summit with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Roh says he will discuss ``ending the Cold
War on the Korean peninsula and realizing a new order of
reconciliation.''
   China, Soviet Union and Japan, neighbors of the hostile Koreas,
are seen as important behind-the-scene forces in the talks.
   All three, plus the United States, which maintains 43,000 troops
in South Korea, would benefit from a lessening of tensions on the
peninsula.
   Korea was divided in 1945 into Communist North and capitalist
South, and fought a war from 1950 to 1953.

<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Navy aircraft practicing takeoffs from
the carrier USS Lexington collided Monday over the Gulf of Mexico,
and the two pilots were missing, the Navy said.
   The two TA-4 Skyhawk aircraft apparently collided in the air at
4:10 p.m. about 85 miles northwest of Key West, said Lt. Cmdr. Ray
Kempisty, spokesman for Naval Education and Training in Pensacola,
where the carrier is based.
   The Coast Guard joined the crew of the Lexington in searching
for the pilots, but neither had been found by Monday night,
Kempisty said.
   Each of the single-engine jets carried one occupant, the Navy
said.
   At the time of the crash, the weather was fair except for a few
low-lying clouds and winds of about 11 to 16 mph, said the National
Weather Service in Key West. ``I don't think it would have an
effect on the visibility,'' meteorologist Peter Mohlin said.
   The TA-4s, built by McDonnell Douglas Corp., are capable of
carrying 10,000 pounds of ammunition and can travel at a top speed
of 675 mph, according to Jane's ``All the World's Aircraft,'' an
authoritative annual directory.
   The Lexington, a battle-scarred veteran of World War II, is the
Navy's oldest carrier at 47 years and the only one used exclusively
for training naval aviators.
   On Oct. 29, 1989, five people were killed when a T-2 Buckeye
trainer from Meridian, Miss., Naval Air Station crashed into the
ship's control island and cartwheeled across the flight deck in a
fireball.
   The student pilot, Ensign Steven Pontell, 23, of Columbia, Md.,
was making his first attempt to land on a carrier. Navy safety
investigators were unable to pinpoint a cause for the crash,
concluding that pilot error or a throttle malfunction may have been
to blame.
   The Lexington survived hits from a torpedo and kamika{e plane
during World War II. It earned the nickname Blue Ghost because of
its blue-gray paint job and repeated reports by Japanese
propagandist ``Tokyo Rose'' that it had been sunk.
   The ship is scheduled to be decommissioned next November and
efforts have begun to preserve it as a museum.

   A century after her poems were
published, reclusive poet Emily Dickinson is getting the
publication party she never had. And the kind of thing she probably
would have hated.
   ``I guess we're safe in doing it at this time,'' observed Martha
Ackmann, an organizer of Monday's celebration commemorating the
publication of the bulk of Dickinson's poetry 100 years ago. The
publication came four years after the poet's death.
   The poet might have deplored the fuss, but Ackmann said her old
college is just making up for lost time.
   ``We kind of think of it as the publication party Mount Holyoke
never gave Emily Dickinson. An acknowledgement of her
achievement,'' said Ackmann, assistant professor of women's studies
and English at the all-women school.
   About three dozen Dickinson devotees gathered Monday afternoon
for a lecture and poetry accompanied by punch and gingerbread.
Their reasons for attending varied.
   ``I always liked her poetry, for one thing,'' said Sarah Rusk,
who has lived in South Hadley for 50 years.
   Amherst College senior Josh Jacobs, who came to brush up on the
poet, said he thinks Dickinson would probably have lived an
isolated life in any age.
   ``Even now, when you think about the industry which seeks so
persistently to discover people, it seems to me that the way she
lived ... there could be someone like her today who won't be
published till 2130,'' he said.
   The enigma of Dickinson, how she could have been content to see
only eight of her poems published during her lifetime - and those
anonymosly - lies at the heart of the celebration.
   ``The question I've always wanted to ask Emily Dickinson herself
is how did she keep going? What made (her) keep working, working,
working at it? That must have been an enormous respect for art,''
Ackmann said.
   An inability to stop making revisions and a disdain for the
vulgarities of fame are two possible explanations for Dickinson's
reticence.
   ``In the 19th century a successful author was the equivalent of
a 20th-century rock star,'' Ackmann said. ``That would have opened
her life up to public consideration and scrutiny, and I don't think
that she wanted that.''
   ``She was ambivalent at best about publishing,'' said Jane
Crosthwaite, an associate professor of religion and co-organizer of
the commemoration at Mount Holyoke, which Dickinson attended from
1847 to 1848.
   Born 160 years ago Monday into a well-to-do family, Dickinson
often sent poems to friends and family, but showed no inclination
to publish, Ackmann said.
   Legend has it that she always wore white and toward the end of
her life rarely left her house and garden.
   After her death in 1886, her sister Lavinia was clearing out
Dickinson's rooms when she opened up a bottom drawer of a dresser
and discovered ``sheet upon sheet upon sheet upon sheet of poems,''
Ackmann said.
   Lavinia showed the poems to some friends and family and then
arranged for their publication on Nov. 12, 1890, by a Boston
publishing firm called Roberts Bros., Ackmann said.
   The first 500 copies were well received and a second book was
published the following year.
   Publication of the poems, often written in an unfinished form
with perhaps six different adjectives stacked on top of one word,
was not completed until the mid-1950s.
   Ackmann and Crosthwaite said they don't believe Dickinson would
have regretted her lost celebrity.
   ``She said that if fame were to come to her it would come. She
might be rather relieved that she didn't have to confront either
the good or the bad readers of her poetry,'' Crosthwaite said. ``I
don't think she wants to be part of the industry.''

<TEXT>
   ``The Big Funk'' by John Patrick Shanley is a
series of images, some provocative, some downright silly, in search
of a play.
   The new stage work by the Academy Award-winning author of
``Moonstruck'' suffers from a bad case of lofty aspirations. The
play foresakes story and character for heavy-duty messages about
life, death, fear, love and other four-letter words. Oh yes, the
playwright provides two nude scenes - one female, one male - for
those not moved by words alone. You might call it Samuel Beckett
meets ``Oh! Calcutta!''
   Shanley is an accomplished writer whose best plays have a
gritty, distinctive voice and a specific sense of place. ``Danny
and the Deep Blue Sea'' was a brutal blue-collar Apache dance by
two unlikely lovers in The Bronx. ``Italian-American
Reconciliation'' was a looney romance about an inept go-between
trying to save the marriage of a battling husband and wife in New
York's Little Italy.
   There's nothing that concrete in ``The Big Funk,'' which opened
Monday at off-Broadway's New York Shakespeare Festival Public
Theater. In it, Shanley, who also directed his play, settles for
the abstract. The place is here; the time now. The four main
characters arrive one by oneto introduce themselves to the
audience. The introductions don't help.
   First up is a beautiful young woman (Jeanne Tripplehorn) who
calls herself the villain of the piece. She's actually the victim,
put-upon by a sleazy guy who picks her up in a bar. Following her
on stage is a tightrope walker (Jayne Haynes) named Fifi and her
human cannonball of a husband Omar (Graham Beckel) who walks around
with what looks like an old pot on his head.
   They are best friends with an unemployed actor named Austin
(Jake Weber) who saves the girl after she is humiliated in the bar.
She's tormented by that creep (Skip Suddut) who smears petroleum
jelly on her head. She also has a thing for salad oil but that's
not revealed until the second act. The first act ends with a bubble
bath given to the girl by her rescuer. At least it quiets the
audience.
   Act 2 is a Mad Hatter-style dinner for the four friends. During
the meal, Austin waxes murkily about life. For some reason, also
not entirely clear, the actor walks off-stage and then returns -
naked - to lecture the audience on confronting their own fears. He
certainly doesn't have any of his own, being able to stand there in
the buff and remember all his lines.
   The actors are cheerful and enthusiastic in their portrayals of
weirdness, and Tripplehorn and Weber deserve medals for baring more
than their souls. But ``The Big Funk'' remains a collection of odd
portraits and pictures rather than a play. It doesn't say much when
the most arresting moment on stage is not anything the actors say
but rather an oozing family-size jar of Vaseline spilling to the
floor of the stage.

<HEAD>Man's Self-Immolation Is Protest Of U.S. Mideast Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who set himself on fire and died to
protest U.S. policies in the Persian Gulf was a genial, upbeat
person who lived alone on a houseboat and rarely discussed
politics, according to his friends.
   Timothy T. Brown, 48, doused himself with a flammable liquid and
then set it alight Sunday on the steps of a deserted cannery. He
left behind a stack of fliers urging Americans to ``not repeat the
mistake of Vietnam.''
   Brown described himself as Vietnam veteran in the leaflets, but
there was no immediate confirmation from Defense Department
authorities.
   The eaflets were stacked in Brown's van about 100 yards from
where Brown set himself on fire.
   ``I, Tim Brown, Vietnam veteran, declare that my act of
self-immolation is a direct protest of American war policy in the
Middle East,'' he said in the leaflets. ``America, do not go to
war. America, do not repeat the mistake of Vietnam. Don't wait for
the war to start and then protest. Protest now while there is still
time.''
   His death stunned his friends.
   ``We were real surprised and shocked,'' said Marie Carson, the
owner of a florist's shop. Carson, who sold Brown a houseboat
earlier this year, added that he ``seemed real upbeat and
positive.''
   Another neighbor, Diana Dickson, said she was baffled by Brown's
suicide note ``because he never talked about anything political.''
   ``I hate to invalidate what he said in his letter, but I find it
hard to believe because he hadn't mentioned it before,'' she said.
   Brown, a knife-sharpener who served restaurants and other
customers from his van, was a familiar figure in Isleton, a tiny
fishing village in the rustic Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a lush
network of levees, rivers and small towns about 50 miles east of
San Francisco.
   Bob Brian, a spokesman for the Sacramento County coroner,
confirmed that Brown's death was a suicide.
   A police officer who declined to be identified said
investigators believe the liquid was gasoline.

   Gunmen killed a lawyer and a
policeman Tuesday in separate attacks in the capital.
   The attacks appeared similar to tactics adopted by Communist
assassination teams, but police mobile patrol dispatcher Cpl. Oscar
Espino said investigators could not immediately rule out other
possible motives such as personal grudges.
   Police said lawyer Franklin Farolan had just stepped out of his
car near his office in the Ermita district when a man approached
and shot him pointblank at about 7:30 a.m.
   The gunman escaped with four companions, Espino reported.
   Espino said that about 30 minutes later, a gunman - described by
witnesses as appearing similar to Farolan's attacker - killed
Patrolman Maximo Gaa as he was walking in another part of Ermita
district.
   The killer and several companions fled on foot.
   On Monday, gunmen burst into a building in suburban Ateneo
University and killed two union leaders and wounded a third as they
were attending a seminar.

   Israel is confident the United States will not
permit Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to link the Persian Gulf crisis
to the Arab-Israeli conflict, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
said Monday.
   The Israeli government will not consent ``to any deal with
enemies who wish to destroy us,'' Shamir said in a speech upon
receiving the $100,000 Jabotinsky Prize as a ``Defender of
Jerusalem.''
   ``We will not be surprised if soon a number of states, not only
Arab governments, will move to appease Saddam Hussein at the
expense of Israel,'' Shamir said.
   ``The well-known argument will be that Israel should make a
contribution, ostensibly for the sake of world peace. Let me,
therefore, state at the very outset: Israel in 1990 is not
Czechoslovakia of 1938,'' he said.
   ``We trust the American government's determined stand not to
permit Saddam Hussein to link the gulf crisis with the Arab-Israel
conflict and the Palestinian issue,'' Shamir said.
   The Iraqi leader ``knows that Israel will not remain passive if
he tries to harm us,'' Shamir said. ``He is trying hard to fool the
world into believing that he is defending the Arabs against what
they call the Zionist enemy. He is fooling only himself and his
blind supporters.''
   A rapid U.S. buildup of the U.S.-dominated multinational force
is in progress, aimed at bringing troop strength in the region to
400,000 by mid-January. That coincides with the Jan. 15 deadline
the U.N. Security Council has given Saddam for getting out of
Kuwait or facing possible military action.
   On another topic, Shamir said 1,000 to 2,000 Soviet Jews are
arriving in Israel daily.
   ``In the month of November, 27,000 of our brethren arrived,''
with even more expected in December, he said.
   ``By the end of 1990, we could arrive at a figure of 180,000 for
the year. That equals the number of Russian Jews who came to Israel
... from 1968 to 1988. There is now a realistic expectation that we
may, indeed, increase our population by 1 million in the next three
to five years. This is equivalent to the United States absorbing 60
million immigrants in three to five years,'' he said.
   It will cost some $40 billion to absorb the immigrants, he said,
adding, ``To provide such a vast sum will require the joint effort,
the aggregate strength, and the collective thinking and ingenuity
of the entire Jewish people.''
   Shamir was to leave for Washington after speaking Monday night.
   Outside the hotel, two small groups demonstrated, including
about 25 people, led by Rabbi Avi Weiss, who held signs urging
freedom for Jonathan Pollard. He was sentenced to life in prison in
1987 for spying for Israel.
   The other demonstrators represented a coalition of progressive
Jewish groups.

   If Saddam Hussein were forced from
Iraq but his military forces were left intact, he would claim the
late Gamal Abdel Nasser's mantle as the champion of the Arab world,
Saudis fear.
   Saudi officials, speaking Monday on condition of anonymity,
echoed the concern voiced a day earlier by U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker III. Baker said that even a peaceful solution to the
gulf crisis would be followed by continued pressure on Saddam to
curb his military power.
   ``He can't keep his military. He'll be a hero. He'll make Nasser
in 1956 look like Mickey Mouse,'' said one Saudi source.
   Nasser, the populist Egyptian president who died in 1970, became
an idol in the Arab world after standing up to the French and
British forces backing Israel in the 1956 attempt to reverse his
nationalization of the Suez Canal.
   He used his pan-Arab nationalism to appeal to public opinion
across North Africa and the Middle East, destablizing many
pro-Western governments in the process. His memory remains a potent
force in the Arab world today.
   The Saudis see history repeating itself in Saddam's vast
military arsenal and political ambitions.
   Saddam has the biggest and most powerful army in the Arab world,
with a million troops, a missile armory and other weapons of mass
destruction.
   Most officials expect he will find a way to extricate himself
from Kuwait before being attacked by the 26-nation alliance that
began deploying troops in Saudi Arabia soon after Kuwait was
invaded Aug. 2.
   But even after a retreat, Saddam will ``say he stood up not just
to the United States, but to the whole world,'' a Saudi source
said.
   The future threat would be both political and military. Saddam's
invasion of Kuwait, an emirate disliked by poor Arabs for its vast
oil wealth and limited rights for foreign workers, struck a popular
chord in many parts of the Arab world.
   It added to his claim of achieving a victory against Iran, a
traditional Arab enemy, in the 1980-88 war, despite having gained
nothing in the end.
   ``They just love this white stallion stuff, Saladin and all
that,'' said an Asian diplomat, referring to the Arab general who
in 1187 recaptured Jerusalem from the European crusaders.
   Saddam, who likens himself to the Kurdish Saladin, is often
shown on Iraqi television heroically mounted on a white charger.
   ``Arabs will say, `He's tough, he can solve our problems, let's
follow him,''' the diplomat added.
   Saddam has already tried to capitalize on that image with his
attempt to link his withdrawal to an Israeli pullout from the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Occupying another Arab land and torturing Arabs does not give
hope that the Palestinians can be liberated,'' said a senior Saudi
diplomat.
   The Saudis are concerned that what Saddam does not gain through
charisma he can achieve through the threat of force, especially if
he develops nuclear weapons within the next few years.
   They don't want U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq lifted
unless Iraq reduces the size and power of his military, or at least
makes U.N.-backed guarantees not to use its arms again on fellow
Arabs.
   ``We can't just stop at the withdrawal. The Iraqi army has to be
reduced to a degree that it won't threaten us,'' said the senior
diplomat.
   The Saudis, despite buying billions of dollars' worth of
advanced weaponry over the last decade, found themselves hopelessly
unable to combat Saddam when he invaded Kuwait.
   The Saudis have embarked on a crash expansion of their military
and are buying more weapons. But analysts say that even when that
program is completed, they will still not be able to defend
themselves without outside help.

   More than 400 Britons held captive by Saddam
Hussein returned home Monday to jubilant friends and family
members. One former hostage became engaged on the spot.
   A plane carrying 384 former hostages, mostly British men,
arrived late Monday at Gatwick airport on an Iraqi Airways flight
from Baghdad.
   Earlier Monday, 101 freed Britons landed at London's Heathrow
airport on a British Airways Boeing 767 from Frankfurt, Germany,
where they arrived on Sunday from Baghdad.
   Twenty-two other hostages - including 13 Britons, five Irish and
four Australians - arrived at Heathrow on a British Airways flight
from Rome. They also left Iraq on Sunday.
   The former hostages at Gatwick were reunited with families and
friends at a landing gate before clearing customs and passport
control.
   ``As the plane came down, they (the relatives and friends) all
rushed to the window and a huge cheer went up,'' said Gatwick
airport spokeswoman Caroline Nicholls.
   Briton Raymond Washer said he had been held as a hostage at
Kuwait City university and described how Iraqi troops looted the
Kuwaiti capital.
   ``They had taken it to pieces brick by brick, just about
everything,'' he said. ``They even took the little generators that
were running the traffic lights. There was nothing left. Saddam
Hussein will not move until he has taken everything out of
Kuwait.''
   Washer said the Iraqis captured him and others as they tried to
escape across the desert in a convoy of vehicles a few days after
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``They picked us up just five miles from the (Saudi Arabian)
border,'' he said.
   Steve Hicking, a 30-year-old Australian oil worker who arrived
on the flight from Rome, proposed marriage to his girlfriend,
Lesley Campbell, when they met at the airport. She accepted.
   The British Foreign Office said two more charter planes will fly
to Kuwait on Tuesday to pick up another 320 hostages.

<TEXT>
   Six deputies were convicted Monday of
conspiring to steal cash from suspected drug dealers in one of the
worst scandals in the history of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department.
   A seventh deputy was convicted of money laundering, but the jury
deadlocked on whether to convict him of conspiracy. The panel also
deadlocked on numerous other charges against all the lawmen.
   The seven deputies, all former members of an elite narcotics
unit in the nation's most populous county, were charged with
stealing $1.4 million in drug cash. The case caused embarrassment
and a major shakeup in the department.
   Prosecutors portrayed the defendants as corrupt individuals who
abused the public trust and showed evidence that they stashed
thousands of dollars in shoe boxes and bought boats, homes, cars
and vacations and made numerous other purchases beyond their
$40,000 to $60,000 salaries. They dismissed the defendants'
arguments that they bought the items with cash earned through
gambling, inheritance or baby-sitting.
   The defense criticized the prosecution's reliance on testimony
by drug suspects and the deputies' ex-boss, former Sgt. Roger
Sobel, who testified as part of a plea agreement.
   The deputies were part of a narcotics team called Major
Violators Crew II, which made some of the department's biggest
cocaine and money seizures.
   Authorities accused the men of seizing drug cash during raids,
then obtaining statements from alleged traffickers disowning the
cash. The deputies then allegedly stole a substantial portion of
the money and divided it among themselves.
   The defense said the deputies were victims of their former boss,
Sobel, who pleaded guilty in the case and testified about alleged
money skimming operations.
   The trial lasted seven weeks and the federal jury deliberated
just over six days before reaching its verdicts. U.S. District
Judge Edward Rafeedie declared a mistrial on the deadlocked counts.
   ``I'm sure this jury did the best job they could,'' said one of
the seven, Deputy James R. Bauder. ``But we're disappointed.''
   ``The verdicts handed down today are not an occasion to
celebrate,'' Sheriff Sherman Block said Monday. ``They are not a
victory. They are the just conclusion to the unlawful actions of a
few who sought to hide their crimes behind a badge of honor.''
   The jury concluded that six of the deputies stole $48,000 in a
1989 incident captured by the FBI on videotape. But the panel
deadlocked on other charges and reached not-guilty verdicts on
charges related to the theft of $527,000 by three deputies.
   Convicted of conspiracy and stealing funds earmarked for the
Sheriff's Department were Bauder, Daniel Garner, Terrell Amers,
Eufrasio Cortez, John Dickenson and Ronald Daub. The jury also
convicted Garner, Amers, Bauder, Cortez and Daub of filing false
tax returns.
   A seventh deputy, Macario Duran, was convicted of structuring
cash transactions to avoid federal reporting requirements of
transactions of $10,000 or more.
   Cortez and Daub also were convicted of money laundering and
structuring transactions. Cortez also was convicted of interstate
transportation of unlawfully gained money.
   The deputies remained free on bail.

<TEXT>
   A Chinese student returned from the United States
on Monday saying he wants to attend the trial of pro-democracy
activist Wang Juntao to see if it is fair.
   Ge Xun, 31, who was studying at Texas A&amp;M University when last
year's military crackdown occurred, said he heard that Wang will
soon be tried for his involvement in the pro-democracy movement.
   ``I'd like to be a witness of the fairness of the court,'' said
Ge, who described himself as Wang's friend.
   Chinese sources say Wang, editor of a now-banned economic
studies weekly, and publisher Chen Zeming were charged with
plotting to overthrow the government, a crime punishable by death.
Both were arrested more than a year ago.
   The two were accused of manipulating the students who led
protests urging democratic reforms. In June 1989, the army fired on
protesters. Hundreds were reported killed. Thousands were arrested
in a nationwide crackdown on dissent that followed.
   Ge said he believes he is taking a risk by planning to push to
attend the court proceedings, ``but it's worth taking because
without anybody knowing, it's going to be a secret trial.''
   China's constitution guarantees that criminal trials be open to
the public, except in cases involving state secrets, private
affairs of individuals or minors. But prior approval is required to
attend court proceedings, so the government could legally prevent
Ge from attending the hearings.
   Family and friends frequently were barred from past trials of
political offenders and foreign journalists and other foreign
observers could not attend.
   International human rights groups ask open trials for people
charged in connection with the pro-democracy movement.
   Before Ge left the United States, callers alerted news
organizations to his plans to attend court sessions and said when
he would arrive at Beijing airport.
   Upon his arrival, Ge approached reporters and said he wanted to
talk. But after a few brief comments, Ge was whisked away by a man
he said was concerned about his safety.
   In the past few weeks, court proceedings have started for about
a dozen people accused of crimes for their involvement in the
pro-democracy movement.

   The most hotly contested mayor's race in
Berkeley history continues without an official winner after a judge
refused to rule Monday on whether 386 late-arriving absentee
ballots should be counted.
   Presiding Judge Howard Schwartz said he wanted to issue a
written opinion later this week because his decision could call
into question California's system for accepting absentee votes.
   The Alameda County Superior Court judge continued a temporary
restraining order preventing the city clerk from declaring a
winner.
   Mayor Loni Hancock is 77 votes ahead of former City Councilman
Fred Weekes, according to all undisputed regular and absentee
ballots counted Friday from the Dec. 4 runoff. The tally was 17,641
votes to 17,564.
   Weekes, who got 63 percent of some 7,000 absentee ballots cast
in the runoff, wants the city clerk to also count the 386 mail-in
votes that were postmarked by Dec. 4 but received later.
   Absentee ballots typically favor conservative candidates. Both
Hancock and Weekes are Democrats but Weekes is considered more
conservative.
   Hancock's campaign contends that counting the late-comers would
violate state election law, which requires the clerk to count only
those ballots that are in hand when the polls close.
   But Weekes and his attorneys claim the rules should be bent
because the city clerk was lax in her duties by sending out
absentee ballot forms too late - as late as the Friday before the
election - to allow timely return.
   Meanwhile, Hancock, said she is considering seeking a recount of
the Nov. 6 election that forced the runoff. The mayor got 49.9
percent of the vote, falling just short of the 50 percent plus one
vote needed to win the election outright.

   Nearly half of the nation's black children
live in poverty and the youngest are the worst off, a black
research organization said Monday.
   The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies said black
children under 3 tend to live in families headed by women in their
20s who have never married and have few marriage or job prospects.
   ``If current trends hold, these children will be increasingly
hard pressed to overcome the burdens imposed by poverty,'' the
center said. ``Growing numbers of them will not succeed.''
   Cynthia Rexroat, a Clemson University sociologist who is the
author of the study, said, ``The youngest children are even more
likely to be risk than are the older.''
   Of all black children, the study said 46.5 percent were in
poverty in 1984, the study said.
   Ms. Rexroat said children younger than 3 in families headed by
never-married women had the highest poverty rate of all, 87 percent
in 1984, compared with 76 percent in 1979. She said nearly
two-thirds of these women were in their 20s.
   ``I would expect these trends would hold up as the 1990 census
data become available,'' she said.
   Belinda Tucker, acting director of the Center for Afro-American
Studies at the University of California at Los Angeles, said
sociological projections indicate 30 percent of black women born in
the early 1950s will never marry.
   ``According to our research, black Americans value marriage as
highly as any other ethnic group,'' she said. ``There is mounting
evidence that limited employment prospects account for much of the
decline in marriage.''
   She said increased homicide and crime rates among young black
men were adding to the problem.
   ``Rationally, why would any young woman marry a young man who
stands a pretty good chance of either going to jail or being killed
and has no job prospects anyway?'' Ms. Tucker asked.
   James Stewart, vice provost and associate professor at
Pennsylvania State University, said, ``One of the factors that
contributes to the stagnant status of never-married young women is
the ineffectiveness of the schooling they have experienced over the
last 15 years.''
   ``It is in part the decline in the quality of education and the
ability to translate the education that they have into occupations
that allow them t move out of poverty,'' Stewart said.
   The study painted the economic picture for black Americans as a
study in contrasts.
   ``On the one hand, there is a growing middle class that has made
great strides toward closing the gap between blacks and whites with
respect to education, employment, and therefore, economic resources
and stability,'' it said.
   ``At the same time, a growing segment of the black population is
increasingly mired in poverty.''
   The study was discussed at a conference sponsored by the center,
which conducts research with the aim of improving the lot of black
Americans.
   Using data from the 1980 census, Ms. Rexroat concluded that the
average black child who lives with a never-married mother will
spend 15 childhood years in poverty.
   The situation was brightest in the South, where the poverty rate
for black children declined from 43 to 37 percent between 1969 and
1979. It rose only in Atlanta, Birmingham, Ala., and Jacksonville,
Fla., among 25 southern cities studied.
   The deepening of poverty for black children was most pronounced
in the Midwest, where 37 percent of all black children relied on
public assistance in 1984. This was nearly double the 20 percent
figure of 1979.
   In 20 metropolitan areas outside the South, poverty increased
among black children on an average of 30 percent to 35 percent from
1969 to 1979, the study said. It said the percentage on welfare
increased by 11 points in Milwaukee and Cincinnati and by 10 points
in Buffalo.
   The report called for ``comprehensive strategies and programs to
improve the quality of education, provide skills training for the
jobs of the future, and ensure equal access to employment
opportunities.''

<HEAD>CBS Late-Night News Show Gets Ax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``America Tonight,'' a late-night CBS News
series, has been axed and will be succeeded next month by five
action-adventure series airing Monday through Friday, CBS said
Monday.
   ``America Tonight,'' begun as a series of specials after Iraq's
Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait, became a regular late-night competitor
of ABC News' ``Nightline'' and NBC's ``Tonight Show'' on Oct. 1.
   Its final broadcast will be on Jan. 18, three days after the
deadline the United Nations has given Iraq to get out of Kuwait.
   The series replacing the show has the umbrella title of ``CBS
Late Night'' and will start on Jan. 21.
   Charles Kuralt, who co-anchored ``America Tonight'' with Lesley
Stahl, said in an interview last month he expected the ax to fall
because CBS had committed itself to entertainment fare at the 11:30
p.m. EST time period.
   His half-hour series, whose national ratings generally put it
third against its network rivals, had replaced entertainment
programs that succeeded CBS' ill-fated late night talk-variety
series, ``The Pat Sajak Show.''
   CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky said in a statement
that the five new late-night series coming to CBS ``represent
programming of prime-time quality, with a more adult bite because
of the late hour.''
   The shows range from ``Fly By Night,'' a light-hearted series
about an air charter service, to ``Scene of the Crime,'' an
anthology series of thrillers created by producer Stephen J.
Cannell.
   The new series and the night on which each one will appear are
``Sweating Bullets'' on Monday, ``Fly By Night'' on Tuesday,
``Scene of the Crime'' on Wednesday, ``The Exile'' on Thursday and
``Dark Justice'' on Friday.

   The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
on Monday appealed for 1.3 million tons of food for Sudan, where
millions of people are threatened by famine.
   A spokesman for Western donor countries reported has offered
help, but Sudan's military government said it would accept food
donations only if the junta is in charge of transportation and
distribution.
   Estimates of the number of people at risk in Africa's largest
nation vary from 3 million to 11 million. In October, the director
of the U.S. Committee for Refugees, Roger Winter, said Sudan faces
a famine of ``biblical dimensions.''
   The U.N. agency said 1 million tons of food aid is needed to
compensate for failure of the 1990-91 harvest because of drought
conditions. Another 300,000 tons is necessary to replenish food
stocks at ``dangerously low levels'' after last year's poor
harvest.
   In addition, Sudan will need fuel and other support to
distribute the food, agency said in a news release distributed in
Nairobi.
   The Sudanese government acknowledges a ``food gap'' of about 1
million tons of grain.
   The United States has criticized the government for alleged
attacks on grain stocks to keep them from areas controlled by
southern rebels.
   In previous relief operations for southern Sudan, Western donors
and the United Nations have insisted on at least partial
involvement in transportation and distribution to make sure the aid
gets to the affected people.
   The U.N. agency's appeal, based on a recent crop assessment
throughout Sudan, is the latest in a string of calls for help for
the northeast African nation of more than 25 million people.
   On Sunday, Sudan's military strongman, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir, met in the capital of Khartoum with British Ambassador
Allen Ramsey, who was representing Western donor countries.
   The official Sudan News Agency quoted Ramsey on Monday as
expressing Western willingness to provide food for famine victims.
The report did not say how much food the Western nations would
provide.
   It is the second consecutive year of severe food shortages in
Sudan because of lack of rain.
   The harvest also has been badly hindered for years by an
8-year-old civil war in southern areas that has has killed hundreds
of thousands of people and displaced as many more.

   The Soviet Union, which has stood with the United
States in the five-month drive to get Iraq out of Kuwait, on Monday
backed the tough stand taken by Secretary of State Jmes A. Baker
III on holding talks in Baghdad.
   The endorsement came from Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze at a meeting in Houston with Baker on the Persian Gulf
situation.
   Baker has rejected an Iraqi proposal that he go to Baghdad on
Jan. 12, only three days before the deadline set by the U.N.
Security Council for Iraq to quit Kuwait or face a forcible
eviction.
   Baker said Sunday he ``won't be a party to playing games that
back us up to that deadline.''
   He proposed going to Baghdad to see President Saddam Hussein
either Dec. 20, 21 or 22 or on Jan. 3.
   At Baker's Houston meeting with Shevardnadze, a senior Soviet
official said, ``the foreign minister reiterated his support, his
understanding of that schedule.''
   The Soviets do not plan to send an emissary to Baghdad ``for the
time being,'' the Soviet official said. The top Soviet expert on
the Persian Gulf, Yevgeny Primakov, has made two previous trips to
the Iraqi capital for talks with Saddam Hussein.
   This official spoke to reporters after the Baker-Shevardnadze
meeting on condition that he not be identified. A U.S. official
also briefed reporters on the same condition.
   The U.S. official said the Iraqi government had not responded to
Baker's rejection of the Jan. 12 proposal, though Iraq's ambassador
has said there should be no problem in arranging a suitable date
for Baker to visit Baghdad.
   Shevardnadze's support, and deferral of any new Soviet overtures
to Saddam Hussein, strengthens the united stand taken by the two
superpowers against Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Baker's trip could be the last opportunity for Iraq to yield to
international demands for a pullout before facing an attack.

Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's election season got its official
kickoff Monday when Mayor Richard M. Daley and 150 other candidates
for city offices tossed their hats and nominating petitions into
the ring for next year's races.
   ``I'm proud of how far we have come in these 20 months, but I
know there is still much more to be done,'' said Daley, who is
finishing a two-year half-term that resulted from the 1987 death of
Mayor Harold Washington.
   He spoke at the City Hall office his late father, Richard J.
Daley, occupied for 21 years.
   His announced challengers in the Feb. 26 Democratic primary are
Alderman Danny K. Davis and former Mayor Jane Byrne. The slated
Republican candidate, police Detective George S. Gottlieb, is not
expected to mount a serious challenge in heavily Democratic
Chicago.
   Daley aides joined scores of candidates, political aides and
reporters outside the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners to
file petitions as soon as the office opened at 9 a.m.
   Candidates for mayor, city clerk, city treasurer and alderman in
the city's 50 wards were required under a new state law to file at
the day's outset to qualify for a chance to appear first on the
ballot. Top ballot positions will be determined by lottery on Dec.
26.
   Mrs. Byrne, who said workers were still compiling her petitions,
criticized Daley for promising to work toward solving problems she
said he hasn't addressed in his two years in office.
   ``The homicide rate has been at an all-time high for the last
six months,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   Davis, a consensus candidate of the black community, filed his
petitions in person. ``Ours is what one might call a people's
campaign,'' he said.

<HEAD>Administration Seeks to Limit Saddam's Gains From Hostage Release</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS grafs 7-9: ``In other,'' with Soviets support Baker

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Monday cautioned
against counting Iraq's release of foreign hostages as a step away
from the brink of war.
   In a speech clearly aimed at limiting Saddam Hussein's publicity
gains from the hostage release, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
called the Iraqi president ``the world's all-time hostage taker''
and said the military threat is growing.
   Cheney mentioned no specific numbers of Iraqi forces in Kuwait,
but a Pentagon source, citing U.S. intelligence reports, later said
that Iraqi troops in and around Kuwait have grown beyond the
480,000 detected in the area last week. The source, who discussed
the matter on condition he not be identified, indicated that the
Iraqi occupation force is now at or near 500,000.
   President Bush, speaking at a ceremony proclaiming Monday as
Human Rights Day, lashed out at Saddam for inhumane treatment of
the Kuwaitis and their nation.
   ``The eyewitness accounts that I have heard from Kuwaiti
citizens are a catalog of human misery: looting, torture, rape,
summary execution, acts of unspeakable cruelty,'' Bush said. ``What
has happened to Kuwait is more than an invasion. It is a systematic
assault on the soul of a nation.''
   Cheney spoke shortly after a chartered Pan Am jet carrying 152
American and four Canadian former hostages lifted off from
Frankfurt, Germany, en route to Andrews Air Force Base, Md. Saddam
has promised the release of about 8,000 American, European and
Japanese citizens who had been forbidden from leaving Kuwait and
Iraq.
   In other developments, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze expressed support for the refusal of Secretary of
State James A. Baker to agree to go to Baghdad on Jan. 12, three
days before the United Nations deadline for the evacuation of
Kuwait. Officials at the Baker-Shevardnadze meeting in Houston said
Shevardnadze agreed with Baker's proposal of Dec. 20, 21 or 22 or
Jan. 3.
   A new poll showed support among Americans for President Bush's
Persian Gulf policy little changed from what it was a week ago, 62
percent vs. 61 percent. The poll of 518 Americans by telephone on
Sunday taken by ABC News said 61 percent expect war with Iraq, down
14 points in the wake of the release of hostages by Iraq.
   The poll has a likely margin of uincertainy of 5 percentage
points eight way, ABC said.
   ``In these past few days as he has released hostages he has
simultaneously continued to build up his deployments in Kuwait, to
enhance his fortifications and to add additional forces to the
region,'' Cheney told a defense industry conference.
   The Pentagon announced last week that Iraq had added 30,000
troops in Kuwait and southern Iraq, bringing the total to 480,000.
Cheney said the United States has 250,000 troops in the region,
along with 200,000 from allied nations.
   On Capitol Hill, congressional officials said the administration
would soon ask Congress for $12 billion to $20 billion to help pay
the costs of Operation Desert Shield. The extra money is needed to
pay for the estimated 200,000 reinforcements that President Bush
ordered to the gulf on Nov. 8, a move Bush said would give the
United States an offensive military option against Iraq.
   The request would meet most expenses of the gulf operation for
the current budget year, but the extra money would not cover the
cost of a war with Iraq, officials indicated.
   A senior Pentagon official confirmed that the added costs of
Desert Shield in 1991 would be as much as $20 billion, and he said
the administration expected to receive additional financial
contributions from allies who have already committed more than $7
billion.
   The official said Saudi Arabia and some other gulf nations had
made open-ended commitments at the start of Desert Shield in August
to help underwrite the operation. He said it was unclear how much
of the added cost would be covered by the gulf nations and other
allies such as Japan and Germany.
   During a trip to Europe last week, Cheney told reporters he had
asked NATO allies for additional unspecified contributions, but it
appeared that his request was mainly for military rather than
financial assistance.
   In his speech to the American Defense Preparedness Association,
Cheney said the public should not view Iraq's mass release of
hostages as a sign that Saddam is backing away from his campaign to
``crush the life out of Kuwait.''
   ``He has given us absolutely no indication whatsoever of any
intention'' of complying with the U.N. resolutions requiring that
Iraq withdraw its armed forces from Kuwait and allow the return of
the exiled Kuwaiti monarchy, Cheney said.
   In spelling out the administration's reasons for committing
American troops to the gulf and threatening to use them against
Iraq, Cheney put special emphasis on the global economic interests
at stake.
   ``There is no nay-saying the fact that one of the major concerns
we have is the very real possibility that should Saddam Hussein
succeed in his aggression, should he be allowed to keep Kuwait,
that he would be in a position to directly control over 20 percent
of the world's proven oil reserve,'' Cheney said.
   Cheney said that unlike Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, who have used
most of their oil revenues in recent years to modernize their
economies, Iraq used $50 billion over a 10-year span to build the
world's sixth-largest army and to pursue weapons of mass
destruction, including chemical, biological and nuclear arms.
   He also cited as part of the rationale for challenging Saddam in
Kuwait ``the very real threat to the continued existence of the
state of Israel'' posed by the Iraq military.
   The defense secretary also said a longstanding U.S. commitment
to preserving the independence of Saudi Arabia and other gulf
states is ``at the heart of this.''

<HEAD>13 Killed in Fourth Day of Hindu-Moslem Clashes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED A. MANNAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HYDERABAD, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten people were stabbed to death Monday
in continuing Hindu-Moslem clashes that have left at least 118
people dead in this southern city over the past four days, police
said.
   Police opened fire in five sections of the city to control
rampaging mobs of Hindus and Moslems who defied the curfew and took
to the streets, said officials who cannot be identified under
briefing rules.
   They said three people were wounded by gunfire and at least 17
others were injured in knife fights.
   In addition to the 10 people who were killed Monday, three
others died of stab wounds sustained earlier, the officials said.
   A wave of stabbings, arson and looting has gripped this city of
2 million people since Thursday night.
   The riots started when Hindu fundamentalists revived a campaign
to build a temple on the site now occupied by a mosque in the Hindu
holy town of Ayodhya, 710 miles north of Hyderabad.
   The plan also triggered sectarian riots in the northern cities
of Aligarh and Kanpur and in Ahmedabad in the west. At least 40
people have been killed in the last three days in Aligarh, 250
miles west of Ayodhya, news reports said.
   The Hyderabad riots are the worst single outbreak of sectarian
violence in India since the Ayodhya campaign started in October. At
least 380 people were killed in nationwide Hindu-Moslem riots in
October and November.
   Hindu fundamentalists claim that Ayodhya's 16th century Babri
Masjid, or Mosque of Babar, was built on the ruins of a temple they
believe was destroyed by Moslem conquerers. Moslems say the mosque
was built on a vacant plot. Archeologists and historians are
divided on the issue.
   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar has been meeting Hindu
and Moslem leaders in an effort to find a solution to the dispute,
which brought down the government of his predecessor, V.P. Singh,
last month.
   Singh's minority government fell when a Hindu revivalist party
withdrew support to protest his policy of not allowing the mosque
to be demolished.
   Moslems account for 12 percent of India's 880 million people
while Hindus comprise 82 percent.

   A majority of Americans still believe the United
States will go to war with Iraq but the release of U.S. hostages
has raised hopes for peace in the Persian Gulf, an ABC News poll
released Monday shows.
   The 61 percent of those polled who said they expected a war was
down 14 points in a single week, the largest decline in war
expectations since the crisis began more than four months ago, ABC
said.
   Support for war also appears to have declined slightly.
   A week ago, 63 percent of those interviewed said they would
support a war if Iraq does not leave Kuwait until after the Jan. 15
deadline set by the United Nations. This week, 58 percent said they
would support such a war.
   Also, 59 percent now say it would be unacceptable for Iraq to
withdraw from ``some of uwait but not all of it,'' a drop from the
66 percent who thought that way a week ago.
   The poll found continued support for President Bush's handling
of the crisis, with 62 percent supporting his efforts compared with
61 percent last week.
   Also relatively unchanged was the 65 percent, compared to 67
percent last week, who support the United States taking ``all
action necessary, including the use of military force,'' to make
sure Iraq withdraws from Kuwait.
   The survey also found 73 percent were strongly opposed to a Gulf
settlement being linked to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   The random survey questioned 518 Americans by telephone on
Sunday. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage
points.

<HEAD>Reporter Faces Longer Jail Stint If She Refuses To Testify at
Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reporter freed after
spending two days in jail could be fined $500 and face up to six
more months behind bars if she refuses to testify at a murder
trial, a district attorney said Monday.
   Libby Averyt, 26, of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, was freed
Sunday night after the prosecution agreed to allow District Judge
Eric Brown to dissolve contempt charges against her, the newspaper
reported.
   Ms. Averyt has refused to answer questions in the pre-trial
hearing of Jermarr Arnold, whose murder trial is scheduled to begin
Wednesday.
   Nueces County District Attorney Grant Jones said Ms. Averyt
could be fined $500 and face up to six months in jail if she
refuses to testify.
   ``If she's willing to pay that price, she may have to pay it,''
Jones said.
   Prosecutors want to enter as trial evidence articles written by
Ms. Averyt last month because they contain information Arnold did
not reveal to police.
   Defense attorneys don't want the articles admitted, although if
they are allowed, they want Ms. Averyt to testify about the content
of her interviews.
   Jones says her testimony could help him in his pursuit of the
death penalty during the punishment phase of the trial, if Arnold
is convicted.
   ``There was no agreement between the reporter and the defendant
that parts of the interview not be printed,'' Jones said.
   The prosecutor said Ms. Averyt should be made to testify about
the entire interview, including portions not published.
   Brown ordered Ms. Averyt jailed on contempt charges after she
refused Thursday to answer 12 questions about conversations she had
with Arnold, invoking the First Amendment and similar provisions of
the Texas Constitution. She was jailed Friday.
   Ms. Averyt and the newspaper's attorney, Jorge Rangel,
maintained that journalists should not be compelled to reveal
information obtained from news sources if that information was not
published.
   Arnold is standing trial for the 1983 slaying of a 21-year-old
jewelry store clerk, Christina Sanchez.
   In the articles, Arnold says he shot Ms. Sanchez and describes
the shooting and robbery. The articles also report Arnold's
self-described history of rapes, robberies, criminal assaults and
attempted prison escapes.
   The articles quote Arnold saying he feels no remorse for Ms.
Sanchez's death and that he deserves the death penalty.

<HEAD>Federal Mediation Expected in Daily News Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both sides in the Daily News strike said they
hoped a federal mediator could help end the bitter, 6-week-old
walkout. Meanwhile, the newspaper has started an afternoon edition
and filed lawsuits against those it claims have fed strike-related
violence.
   Bernard D. DeLury, director of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service, called the newspaper and its nine striking
unions Dec. 7 to suggest a meeting in Washington.
   ``We consider this a step forward in the negotiation process and
are hopeful that a swift resolution of the strike will be
possible,'' said News Vice President John Sloan. ``We've agreed to
fully cooperate.''
   Theodore W. Kheel, a lawyer advising the unions, called the
offer ``the last clear chance for a settlement.''
   Sloan said DeLury wanted separate meetings with management and
the unions. But George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing
Trades Council, an umbrella group for the striking unions, said a
joint meeting would be necessary.
   Union leaders say they fear that the Tribune Co. of Chicago,
which owns the News, would soon close the paper if the mediation
attempt fails.
   Sloan said the parent company would review the Daily News'
situation during a board meeting Dec. 11, but said he was confident
the Tribune Co. would continue to support the paper.
   City police and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms have been investigating allegations of bombings and arson
for several weeks, U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney said.
   Maloney said the inquiry was started at the request of the
newspaper.
   ``There have been a number of fires and uses of explosive
devices in the strike,'' he said.
   Publisher James Hoge has been critical of the city's response to
attacks on replacement drivers. On Dec. 6 he accused New York's
mayor and police of ignoring evidence the strikers conspired to
destroy the newspaper with violence and intimidation.
   Hoge was angry that a replacement driver was beaten and stabbed
about 12 hours after the driver was summoned to testify before a
grand jury investigating strike violence.
   ``I submit that the police need to face up to what is clearly
the reality today in this community: The gangsters are running
free, and nobody is willing to say what is really occurring,'' Hoge
said at a news conference.
   The newspaper offered a $100,000 reward for information about an
attack early Dec. 6 in Irvington, N.J., on the replacement driver,
Carlos Chacon.
   Police said 15 men armed with baseball bats, bottles and a knife
attacked Chacon, who was hospitalized afterward.
   Hoge stopped short of saying the grand jury summons and the
stabbing were directly linked.
   Chacon was called as a potential witness for an investigation
into an Oct. 27 incident in which a striking Daily News driver
allegedly smashed a delivery truck's headlights and windows, Hoge
said.
   Among those the newspaper has sued in connection with
strike-related violence was Joseph Martin, a truck driver for The
New York Times who allegedly smashed his truck into a News vehicle
on Nov. 3.
   The lawsuit alleged the replacement driver suffered severe
injuries in a subsequent assault by Martin.
   Kheel called the lawsuits unfounded and said the unions will
challenge them.
   On Dec. 4, the newspaper launched its first afternoon edition in
nine years.
   Street hawkers distributed 30,000 copies of the initial press
run. The tabloid had blue ink printed across the top and bottom of
the front page to distinguish it from morning editions.
   Using management, replacement workers and employees who crossed
the picket line, the News has published every day during the
strike. But circulation - the nation's third-highest at 1.09
million before the strike - has dropped by more than half.
   The circulation drop has cost the paper many major advertisers.
The News said it expects to lose up to $35 million this quarter and
about $85 million for the year. That's on top of losses of $115
million from 1979 through 1989.

<HEAD>AP and Wire Service Guild Reach Tentative Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Associated Press and the Wire Service Guild
reached tentative agreement on a two-year contract covering more
than 1,300 employees nationwide.
   The agreement, which would replace a contract that expired Nov.
30, provides for raises of 2.8 percent in the first year and 2.3
percent in the second.
   ``I think it's a realistic contract and I think that, given the
economic climate in the industry and its obvious impact on us,
that's what makes it realistic,'' D. Byron Yake, AP director of
human resources, said Dec. 5.
   ``The other side of that is that we're pleased we can offer a
contract that has raises and not freezes and cuts.''
   Kevin Keane, Guild president, said, ``Obviously, the bargaining
committee is disappointed with the size of the wage increase. But
they worked hard, and we're convinced that this is the best
contract we can get, given the labor and economic climate.''
   He said the Guild was recommending ratification by the
membership.
   The contract calls for pay increases that would raise top scale
for newspersons and photographers from $720 to $740 weekly in the
first year of the contract, and from $740 to $757 in the second
year.
   Economic differentials also would go up in the second year of
the contract. News staff employees in New York and Washington would
receive a $10 a week increase in the differential, bringing it to
$97. The differential in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston and
Chicago would go up $15, to $60.
   The contract also offers improved retirement benefits for those
already retired and service credits for active participants in the
pension plan.
   The tentative pact cuts paid maternity leave for women from four
weeks to one week while keeping one week paid paternity leave for
men, and changes unpaid leave time from 18 months to 12 months for
both men and women.
   Under the old contract, men were not given unpaid paternity
leave.
   In addition, women on maternity leave will be allowed to use
eight weeks' full-pay disability regardless of their length of
employment.

<HEAD>State Newspaper Sales Tax Goes Into Effect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Florida Department of Revenue
expects its 6 percent newspaper tax to raise $25.7 million in the
next year. The state's press association hopes to kill the sales
tax in court first.
   Newspapers had to begin paying the sales tax Dec. 9.
   The tax formerly applied only to magazines. Magazine publishers
petitioned the courts for an exemption, but the state Supreme Court
on May 31 ruled that the best way to remedy the situation was to
tax newspapers.
   The court turned down a motion Dec. 6 to delay the tax while the
Florida Press Association appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Meanwhile, newspaper companies are collecting the tax. Some said
they would absorb it on box sales and others planned to raise
per-copy prices.
   Dick Shelton, executive director of the state press association,
said Tennessee, Arkansas, Iowa and several other states have sales
tax cases pending before the U.S. Supreme Court, and that he
expects the Florida case to be consolidated with the others.

<HEAD>Jailed Reporter Released, Still Refusing To Answer Questions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A newspaper reporter was released
Dec. 9 after spending two days in jail for refusing to answer
questions about interviews she conducted with a man on trial for
murder.
   Libby Averyt, 26, of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times was freed
after prosecutors agreed to allow District Judge Eric Brown to
dissolve contempt charges against her, the newspaper reported.
   Brown had ordered Ms. Averyt jailed on contempt charges after
she invoked the First Amendment and similar provisions of the Texas
Constitution after refusing to answer 12 questions about
conversations she had with Jermarr Arnold.
   Averyt and the newspaper's attorney, Jorge Rangel, maintained
that journalists should not be compelled to reveal information
obtained from news sources if that information was not published.
   Arnold is scheduled to stand trial Dec. 12 for the 1983 slaying

<HEAD>Jury Awards $12.4 Million in `Gun for Hire' Case Against Magazine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men whose father was killed by a man
hired through an ad in Soldier of Fortune won a $12.4 million
judgment against the magazine on Dec. 7.
   Michael and Ian Braun claimed that a business associate of their
father saw a classified ad in the magazine placed by Richard Savage
of Knoxville, Tenn., and then arranged to have Savage kill their
father, Richard Braun.
   Savage's classified ad read: ``GUN FOR HIRE: 37-year-old
professional mercenary desires jobs. Vietnam veteran. Discrete and
very private. Body guard, courier and other special skills. All
jobs considered.''
   The magazine stopped running such ads in 1986.
   The business associate, Bruce Gastwirth, Savage and two others
were convicted of Braun's killing. Savage already had been
convicted in a similar murder-for-hire case in West Palm Beach,
Fla., as well as several attempted assassinations that went awry.
   A Braun family attorney, Steve Glassroth, said Soldier of
Fortune should have been aware of news stories about a series of
unrelated crimes in the early 1980s tied to its classified ads.
Those stories should have stopped the magazine from running the
personal services ads long before 1986, he said.
   Robert Brown, the magazine's founder and publisher, denied
seeing any of those stories. He said he ran the ads to help Vietnam
veterans find jobs using their military skills.
   Defense attorney Jim Garrett argued that a publisher has no duty
to investigate every advertiser. But, he said, if the magazine had
checked Savage, it would have found he served in Vietnam and was a
courier under Gen. William Westmoreland.

<HEAD>Reader's Digest Plans Russian-Language Edition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reader's Digest announced plans Dec. 5 for a
two-year test of a Russian-language edition to be published in the
Soviet Union starting in August.
   The magazine is already published in 15 languages in 39
countries. It joins a growing list of American publications
scrambling to gain a foothold in the largely untapped Soviet
market.
   Business Week magazine launched a Russian-language edition this
summer. The Ladies' Home Journal put a 32-page Russian-language
insert in about 10,000 copies of its November issue sent to the
Soviet Union.
   Rodale Press has announced plans to publish a Russian magazine
called The New Farmer. The Journal of Commerce plans a monthly
tabloid in January, and the trade publisher International Data
Group is producing a pair of Russian-language magazines, PC
World-USSR and Manager.
   Magazine Publishers of America officials said Scientific
American and the inspirational magazine Guideposts also are
planning Russian editions.
   Russell J. Melvin, an MPA executive who tracks international
publishing developments, said these efforts ``hinge on hope'' that
changes in the Soviet economic system will open the country to
Western products and ideas.
   In the meantime, publishing ventures face ``nothing but problems
in the short term'' in getting into the Soviet Union.
   Paper is in short supply. Printing operations are not up to
Western standards. Distribution systems are questionable. The
Soviet ruble cannot yet be converted into other currencies.
   But Melvin said the Soviet Union is a powerful lure to
publishers with its 300 million consumers who have been
economically isolated for years.
   ``They have a great desire for the printed word. Virtually every
magazine that is printed is gobbled up, '' Melvin said.
   Publishers who get in now will be ready to give advertisers a
way to reach those readers once their products become available
there, he said.

<HEAD>Contra Backer John Hull Said To Be Living in Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American John Hull, sought in
neighboring Costa Rica in connection with a 1984 news conference
bombing that killed three journalists, has been living in Nicaragua
since October, a newspaper reported.
   Barricada, the official daily of the Sandinista National
Liberation Front, reported that Hull is trying to set up a business
with former Contra rebel leaders.
   While in Costa Rica, he owned a farm and landing strip used to
supply the Contras. He has been implicated in the May 1984
assassination attempt on Nicaraguan rebel leader Eden Pastora
during a news conference.
   A bomb carried into Pastora's jungle headquarters wounded
Pastora and about a dozen reporters and killed American reporter
Linda Frazier and two Costa Rican journalists.
   Prosecutor Jorge Chavarria earlier said Hull and Felipe Vidal, a
Cuban, planned the bombing to avenge Pastora's statements linking
Hull to the CIA. Hull denies the charges.
   Hull was arrested in Costa Rica, but skipped bond in July and
fled to the United States. On Dec. 7 Costa Rica asked for Hull's
extradition.
   But he seemed to have disappeared again. Reporters could not
find him at his home in Juigalpa, and some journalists were told he
had recently left the country, traveling by land with his adopted
daughter Emily.

<HEAD>High-Tech Equipment on Bush Trip Highlights Brazilian Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As President Bush was telling South
Americans Dec. 3 to push for free trade and open up their
economies, hundreds of U.S. journalists covered him using equipment
that - technically - could have been seized by Brazil's federal
police.
   A special press room set up in Brasilia by the U.S. Embassy was
a glaring contrast to the restrictions, barriers and bureaucracy
that inhibit the use of up-to-date conveniences in Brazil and much
of South America.
   American reporters wrote their Bush stories on lightweight
lap-top computers. They filed them on portable fax machines or over
high-speed data channels, using special telephone lines connected
directly to the United States. American broadcast networks, thanks
to a huge, imported dish antenna set up in the hotel parking lot,
beamed reports directly to U.S. satellites.
   Brazil made a special exception for the Washington press. But
under normal circumstances here, computers and faxes and high-speed
communications equipment are on a list of totally prohibited
imports.
   The idea behind the law was to prevent ``foreign imperialists''
from controlling Brazil's sophisticated technology. Many other
South American countries have similar restrictions to protect their
high-tech industries.
   Brazil has a $6 billion-a-year market in computers and related
equipment, though the equipment costs far more than outside the
country.
   A year ago a Brazilian fax cost $8,000. Now one might be found
discounted to $1,500, but most remain in the $2,500-$3,000 range.
In the United States they cost less than $500.
   A 14-inch color monitor for a home computer, made in Brazil and
thus for sale legally, costs $2,800. The U.S. price is $650.
   Brazil's top-of-the-line laser printer costs $20,000. A U.S.
model with the same features sells for $3,500.

<HEAD>Canadian Network Cutting 1,100 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said Dec. 5 it was
eliminating 1,100 jobs and cutting newscasts and other programming
to save $108 million.
   The shortfall is due to government funding cuts, inflation,
declining television advertising, and such other costs as new taxes
and pension funding, said CBC President Gerard Veilleux.
   The cuts represent just under 10 percent of CBC's $1.2 billion
annual budget. About $900 million of that comes from government and
the rest from ad revenue. CBC employs about 10,000 people, and the
layoffs are its worst ever.
   Veilleux said at a news conference that the cuts go into effect
April 1, but some effects will be felt immediately.
   ``These decisions have given me many sleepless nights,'' he told
CBC employees during a closed-circuit televised announcement. ``I
can only trust we're doing the right thing.''
   As part of the cuts, the CBC has decided it can no longer afford
the $20 million annual cost to run Radio Canada International, the
international shortwave radio service, or the $4.5-million cost of
the English and French parliamentary channels, which broadcast
House of Commons proceedings. CBC will ask the government to pick
up the tab for tese operations.
   In addition, English and French radio network budgets will be
cut by 1 percent. The following year, 2 percent will be trimmed
from their budgets.
   Newsworld, CBC's all-news cable channel, is not supposed to be
affected. However, many of its news items originate at regional
stations that will be closed.

<HEAD>Former Panamanian Diplomat Reportedly Focus of Tapes Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI investigation into who leaked tapes of
Manuel Noriega's prison phone calls focuses on a political opponent
who might testify against the deposed Panamanian dictator,
newspapers reported.
   The FBI believes the source of the leak appears to be Jose
Blandon, once an intelligence officer in Panama for Noriega and the
country's former consul general in New York, The Miami Herald and
The Washington Post reported, quoting unidentified sources.
   Blandon denied leaking the government tapes. In an interview
published Dec. 9 in The Post, Blandon said someone in the U.S.
government who wants to sabotage the Noriega trial must have been
responsible.
   ``Somebody in the government was leaking them,'' Blandon said.
Drug enforcement agents were present whenever he had access to the
tapes, and he was allowed to make only written notes, Blandon said.
   The FBI is trying to determine who gave the tapes to Cable News
Network, which aired some of Noriega's conversations from prison
over the past month. The broadcasts were halted briefly while a
federal judge decided whether Noriega's right to a fair trial would
be jeopardized. After reviewing the tapes, the judge decided to let
CNN broadcast them.
   In a related matter, the Justice Department is refusing to
return documents belonging to a CNN reporter, saying they may be
evidence in an investigation of the leaked recordings.
   The Justice Department filed a brief Dec. 3 with the U.S.
District Court in Atlanta opposing a motion by CNN for return of
the documents.
   The materials were in a box taken from a hotel room that
reporter Marlene Fernandez had been staying in. The FBI confiscated
the box after hotel officials, apparently thinking Fernandez had
checked out, reported it as abandoned property.
   The Justice Department said it kept 15 documents and returned
all the other items in the box to CNN, including 52 documents and
five videotape cassettes labeled ``Noriega Tapes.''
   In another development, the network said Dec. 5 it was dropping
its fight to prevent the release of court transcripts of the
Noriega tapes.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, ruling in favor of four
news organizations that demanded access to the transcripts, had
said they would be released unless CNN appealed.
   ``CNN's main concern in opposing unsealing of the transcripts
has been to protect the integrity of agreements with sources,'' CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth said.
   But after reviewing the transcripts, network officials decided
there was little danger of compromising those sources, he said.
   The organizations seeking the transcripts were The Miami Herald,
The Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of Miami and
Gannett Co. Inc. and its USA Today. They argued that the public has
a right to examine the content of the tapes, which were at the
center of a freedom-of-the-press dispute.

<HEAD>Head of Japanese Public TV Wants Global News Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Japan's public broadcasting system said
he wants to create a global news network to counter the spread of
Cable News Network to dozens of countries.
   ``I don't mean to bad-mouth Mr. Turner, but CNN is trying to
force U.S. news on the rest of the world,'' NHK Chairman Keiji
Shima said Dec. 3, referring to CNN head Ted Turner.
   Uder Shima's plan, broadcasters from Asia, Europe and North
America would be responsible for eight-hour daily segments focusing
on their own region.
   Shima said he believed Asians should cover issues about Asia,
but he did not give a detailed explanation why. He also said there
was not enough news about the region being broadcast to other parts
of the globe.
   Shima, in a speech to foreign reporters, acknowledged that the
British Broadcasting Corp. has shown little interest in his
proposal. But he said other major broadcasters have expressed
interest.
   He did not identify those broadcasters, however, and an NHK
spokeswoman said the names could not be released because
negotiations were under way.
   Shima provided no concrete details of his plan, but said he
hoped such a network could be set up in about six months.
   NHK has two channels on Japanese television, one with general
programming and the other featuring educational fare. It also has
two stations for satellite broadcasting. The programming on those
stations includes news broadcasts from several countries.

<HEAD>CBS Affiliate Alerts Network About `Subliminal Messages'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A South Carolina viewer who saw the words
``Adultery!'' and ``Shock Therapy!'' during commercial breaks on
CBS' ``Guiding Light'' wasn't seeing subliminal messages, the
network said Dec. 5.
   The network said the Columbia woman actually saw the first part
of taped promotions for Geraldo Rivera's syndicated talk show that
were supposed to appear only on WCBS-TV in New York.
   `There was a small technical problem in the way our network
computers switch to local stations,'' the network said.
   Then, alluding to the accidental transmission of the ``Geraldo''
promotions on the network, it said:
   ``Occasionally, a fraction of a second of another feed will air.
In this case, it was a promo for an upcoming show to air on WCBS-TV
in New York. We are taking steps to correct this problem.''
   The brief appearance of the promotional announcements
accidentally went out on the network during the pauses it puts in
the ``Guiding Light'' daytime soap opera for local commercials
aired by affiliates, the executive said.
   The goof came to light because of the sharp eyes of viewer Julie
Moore.
   She said that while looking at episodes of the soap opera she
taped last week, she spotted the word ``Adultery!'' in large type,
imposed over the CBS logo, during a commercial break. The words
``Shock Therapy!'' appeared in the same way in the tape of the next
day's show.
   ``I (didn't) know what it was until I ran the tape back,'' said
Moore, who said she discovered the words when she advanced the tape
slowly.

   Texas A&amp;M head football coach R.C. Slocum
has criticized CBS for picking up and broadcasting beforehand a
play that the Aggies used for a crucial two-point conversion
attempt against Texas on Dec. 1.
   The network eavesdropped as the plan was put together on the
sideline late in the fourth quarter. The play failed and Texas held

   Robin Brendle, a spokeswoman for CBS Sports, said broadcasting
the called play was inadvertent, but added, ``A big part of our

the game.''
   Longhorns coach David McWilliams denied his staff heard the
broadcast or knew which play the Aggies were going to run.
   ``We didn't know anything about it,'' McWilliams said. ``If we
had known which direction they were going to run, we would've had

<HEAD>Lawmakers Consider Reviving TV Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State lawmakers are considering a $450,000
plan to provide state-paid television coverage of the next
Legislature.
   The Legislative Council, which conducts the Legislature's
business between annual sessions, tied 5-5 in a vote on the plan
Nov. 30. A final vote probably won't occur until January, officials
say.
   State-sponsored coverage on the Rural Alaska Television Network
was unavailable last year for the first time since 1976.
   Outgoing Sen. Mike Szymanski, D-Anchorage, said he favored
resuming the program because, he said, there was a void in
legislative news coverage last year without it.
   ``I'm not convinced the Legislature got the best coverage it
could have'' from the Capitol press corps, he said. He blamed the
news media for the public's perception that the Legislature did
nothing last year.
   Three companies have bid for the two-year contract: KTOO,
Juneau's public TV sation; SEA TV, a new Juneau-based company; and
the Alaska Television Network, which runs commercial stations in
Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau and Sitka.
   The Legislature convenes Jan. 21.

   Television station WJET laid off its news
director, chief engineer and another employee because of a sluggish
economy and a top-heavy news department, company President John
Kanzius said.
   ``We looked at who could get employment more easily'' in
deciding on the layoffs, Kanzius said Dec. 4. ``It was very
agonizing for us ... We held out making the decision as long as we
possibly could.''
   Local advertising revenues are down, Kanzius said. Erie-area
consumers are spending less because of apprehension about the
Persian Gulf crisis, he speculated.
   In addition to News Director Steve Drexler, a chief engineer and
a promotions employee, the station laid off a part-time reporter,
Kanzius said.

   The first wave of hostages freed under Saddam Hussein's blanket
release headed home today as the United States haggled with Iraq to
get an early date for Secretary of State James A. Baker III's visit
to Baghdad.
   The Bush administration wants nothing less than Saddam's total
withdrawal from Kuwait. It is urging a Baker-Saddam meeting by Jan.
3 so Iraq has time to pull out by Jan. 15, the deadline after which
the United Nations has sanctioned the use of force against Iraq.
   About 175 former American hostages arrived in Germany from
Baghdad on Sunday. Some spoke of hiding barefoot in Kuwait City
apartments, others of being held captive in ``gulags'' at strategic
sites around Iraq.
   Most of the Americans on the U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways jet
that landed in Frankfurt planned to return to the United States
today. A few planned to enter a U.S. Air Force hospital in nearby
Wiesbaden.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON - The United States wants international controls over
Iraq's nuclear weapons and other advanced arms once the
confrontation between the two countries is resolved, Bush
administration officials say.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft spelled out the American vision of the
Persian Gulf's military future Sunday. They also demanded that
Baker's anticipated meeting with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein be
held by Jan. 3.
   The Iraqi leader has offered to meet Baker in Baghdad on Jan. 12
- three days before a United Nations deadline for Iraq to withdraw
from Kuwait or face eviction by military force.
   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Abdul Amir Al-Anbari, would not rule out
a Saddam-Baker session by Jan. 3. But he warned that if fighting
erupts, Amercan losses in one day could surpass total U.S.
casualties during the Vietnam war, when more than 55,000 Americans
died.
   ---&equals;
   HOUSTON - Secretary of State James A. Baker III chose his
hometown to try to wrap up a nuclear weapons reduction treaty with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, but it may take
more than relaxed Texas hospitality to get the job done.
   Between trips to the Johnson Space Center and other diversions
today and Tuesday, Baker and Shevardnadze will review the
conclusions of their negotiating teams and see whether they can
agree on a handful of remaining issues on the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty.
   The toughest is verification - ways to make sure neither side
cheats on terms of the treaty, which will provide for an overall
reduction of about 30 percent in U.S. and Soviet long-range
bombers, missiles and submarines.
   ``I have no doubt that our talks here in Houston will be
productive and that we will continue to tackle some difficult
issues in a constructive spirit,'' Baker said Sunday.
   ---&equals;
   NEW YORK - Cancer death rates in industrialized nations are
rising faster than aging and smoking might account for, heightening
suspicion that pollution and other environmental dangers are at
fault, scientists say.
   Cancer causes about 2.3 million of the 11 million deaths
annually in industrialized nations, according to one of an
international set of reports collected and published by the New
York Academy of Sciences.
   When lung cancer - most often caused by smoking - is excluded,
the cancer death rate among men in industrialized nations has risen
9 percent since 1950, the report said. Cancer death rates for women
have risen in some countries and fallen in others, it said.
   ``Cancer is increasing in industrial countries above and beyond
that due to cigarette smoking or aging alone,'' said Devra Lee
Davis, an editor of a collection of studies and a researcher at the
National Academy of Sciences in Washington.
   ---&equals;
   WARSAW, Poland - Elected by a landslide in Poland's first
popular presidential vote, Lech Walesa promised to get right to
work today on building this struggling young democracy into an
economically sound ``pillar of peace.''
   The man who led the decade-long struggle to end authoritarian
Communist rule acknowledged that ``terribly difficult tasks'' lie
ahead as he attempts to complete the painful transition to a
market-based economy.
   ``I want to work because there is a lot of work to be done,''
the former shipyard electrician told reporters at his Gdansk
headquarters after defeating emigre businessman Stanislaw Tyminski
in Sunday's runoff.
   The Solidarity chief's margin of victory was 77 percent to 23
percent, according to exit polls conducted by the Germany polling
firm Infas. Official results from 294 of the 303 stations had him
ahead 75 percent to 25 percent.
   ---&equals;
   BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank - In the season of Christmas
pilgrimages by Christians from around the world, the town where
Jesus was born has nothing but room at its inns.
   Mayor Elias Freij looks out the window of his office onto the
deserted square at the Church of the Nativity.
   ``Tourists? What tourists?'' he asks rhetorically, sweeping an
arm toward the emptiness. ``This is the worst situation in my
memory.''
   ``With the drums of war beating in the Saudi desert and the
large armada assembling in the (Persian) gulf, people are simply
too scared to come here,'' says Freij, a Greek Orthodox Palestinian
who has been mayor for 18 years.

   When politicians look at the mood of the
nation, they tend to see their own reflections. That's why hawks
and doves are reading opposite messages about the Persian Gulf
crisis from the people back home.
   There are public opinion polls for guidance, but in the debate
about the U.S. course toward Iraq those surveys are counted or
discounted depending on what the numbers show and who's talking
about them.
   President Bush has said again and again that he is not going to
make decisions because of poll ratings, high or low. ``We're not
going to run the foreign policy of this country on the basis of
polls,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III repeated at
congressional hearings on the Desert Shield confrontation.
   But the backing the polls measure is vital to the administration
course in seeking to force Iraq out of Kuwait.
   So when Senate Republicans pointed to a survey that showed solid
support for the course approved by the United Nations Security
Council, threatening military action unless Iraq withdraws by Jan.
15, Baker welcomed the evidence ``that the policy seems to enjoy
the support of the American people.''
   Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., said the poll makes it baffling
that critics of the hard-line Bush policy are ``purporting to
represent a majority of American opinion.''
   That prompted advocates of a more cautious course to tell Baker
that he shouldn't do what he said he wasn't going to do. ``Let's
not make the decision of whether or not to go on the offensive on
the basis of a poll or any number of polls,'' said Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill.
   The poll that counted, of course, was the one on Nov. 6, the
congressional elections. But that was two days before Bush
announced that he was doubling the American troop deployment
against Iraq, to provide an offensive capability if that's what it
takes to get Saddam Hussein's forces out of Kuwait.
   That move became the dividing line in the policy debate. Until
it was made, Bush faced no significant dissent on the use of
international economic sanctions against Iraq and the use of U.S.
forces to defend Saudi Arabia against any further Iraqi advance.
Policy critics now say the administration should wait longer,
perhaps 12 to 18 months, for the sanctions to take their full toll.
   Bush, Baker and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney now say they doubt
the sanctions will force Saddam to quit Kuwait. While there has
been no decision to take offensive action, the administration says,
that must be one of the options, and a realistic one, to force
Iraqi withdrawal.
   Each side says the course it advocates is the best way to gain
U.S. objectives without war.
   That debate was not part of the 1990 campaign although the
administration's decision to increase troop strength was made
before the elections. ``I would say the key decision-making time
was late October,'' Cheney said.
   ``The concern was not an effort to hide the decision, but
rather, that if we announced something relating to Desert Shield
before the election we would be accused of trying to manipulate the
foreign policy considerations to influence the elections,'' Cheney
told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Dec. 3.
   That accusation would almost certainly have been raised. ``I
understand that,'' said Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn. ``But it also
says something about the way in which the American people and their
elected representatives are brought into the decision-making
process.''
   Gore insists that there should be a congressional declaration of
war in advance of any offensive action. ``If the votes aren't there
to declare war, that is the best indication we'll ever have that
the American people do not want war,'' he said. ``To go ahead
anyhow would risk the kind of domestic division that occurred
during Vietnam.''
   Other members of Congress say the message they're getting from
their constituents is one of caution, no matter what the polls
report. Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said his mail and telephone
calls run 8 or 9 to one ``urging the administration to slow down.''
Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, D-Ind., said constituents are telling him the
same thing, because they do not want the United States to get into
a war.
   The question neither side can answer is whether waiting out the
sanctions or adding the threat of a military strike is the course
most likely to settle the Kuwait crisis short of war.

<HEAD>Angel of 1946 Film Comes to Cable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back in 1946, director Frank Capra came up with
``It's a Wonderful Life,'' a wonderful film starring Jimmy Stewart.
It has become a Christmas favorite on television, at least the
uncolorized version.
   Now comes ``Clarence,'' a gentle, at times slyly funny,
computer-age variation of ``Life'' that cable television's The
Family Channel is showing tonight and again Friday and Sunday.
   It stars Robert Carradine as Clarence Oddbody, the gentle angel
who in Capra's film descended to earth to gently persuade the
decent, despairing George Bailey that his life was not as worthless
as he thought.
   There are a few changes in the new film, of course. In Capra's
movie, Clarence, played by Henry Travers, was a genial old duffer
who landed in a small town.
   Carradine's Clarence, who has gotten much younger in heaven
since his fine work 44 years earlier, lands in a busy, noisy big
city. He'd prefer to stay where he is, working on clocks.
   He has agreed to go only because (a) a fellow angel's family is
in trouble, (b) the angel's widow may commit suicide, and (c)
there's a shortage of guardian angels, what with the world in the
shape it is.
   The fellow angel (Richard Fitzpatrick) was a computer whiz who
died suddenly before he could perfect ``Dexter,'' a revolutionary
voice-activated computer cartoon toy for kids.
   Unlike other kid's computer games, which have considerable
violence and all sorts of warlike trolls stomping on each other,
his would have emphasized kindness, decency and even education.
   Now, his widow, Rachel, played by Kate Trotter, must keep their
struggling company going, perfect her late husband's invention, and
fend off an evil mogul (Louis Del Grande) with a soul of garlic. He
wants to buy their firm and use its technology to create even more
violent computer games for kids.
   At the same time, she must care for their two kids, Brent
(Nicolas Van Burek), a sullen teen-age computer ace, and Casey
(Jamie Rainey), a sweet but very sharp little girl.
   Clarence bumbles hisway into their lives after he lands on
earth and is immediately accosted by a panhandler shaking a tin cup
at him. He takes a coin from the cup, telling the startled beggar,
``Thank you.''
   It's one of the many low-key but funny little scenes that dot
the film.
   Another has little Casey immediately suspecting the visitor of
being from elsewhere than planet Earth. Consulting her child's book
of ``Magical Beings,'' she rules out the possibility he is an elf,
a griffin or a phoenix. She learns that every time a bell rings, an
angel gets its wings.
   Sneaking up on him, she shakes a toy donkey with a bell around
its neck. No wings. She tries again. Still no wings. He looks
quizzically at her as she asks in her tiny voice: ``Doesn't this do
anything for you?''
   Constantly monitored by a teen-age recording angel and forbidden
to reveal his identity on pain of being stuck on earth, Clarence
faces a succession of crises, including a big one directly
concerning him.
   He also has to cope with moments of sadness and high anxiety,
not to mention true villainy by the evil mogul that almost drives
the widow Rachel to suicide.
   Alas, suspense is absent. You always have the feeling that
decency will win out and, because the story unfolds at
Christmastime, that there'll even be a happy ending.
   Lesser problems are that some of the scenes in the show's last
half are a little strained, and a brief reunion in heaven goes on a
tad too long.
   But ``Clarence'' generally overcomes all this, and with warmth
and humor. The cause is aided by fine acting by all hands, deft
direction by Eric Till and a warm, generally well-crafted script by
Lorne Cameron and David Hoselton.
   The show doesn't match the rambunctiousness, the great highs and
lows of ``It's A Wonderful Life.'' But it's a solid effort, one the
family will enjoy, and only a Grinch could put the knock on it.

   Elsewhere in television ...
   ONCE MORE, AND STAY IN KEY, PLEASE: This being yuletide, ``CBS
This Morning'' says that on Friday, it will start airing a holiday
medley - specifically ``Oh, What a Beautiful Morning'' and ``Jingle
Bells.'' The music is to be played by the CBS Morning Symphony:
Paula Zahn, a classical cellist; Charles Osgood, an accomplished
pianist; Harry Smith, a lapsed tubist; and Dr. Bob Arnot on
trumpet, more or less. Mark McEwen and Victoria Corderi are to play
bells.

   Few are the economic commentators who haven't
agreed by now that the economy is in recession. Why hold out, with
layoffs rising, retailers forced to cut prices, housing and car
sales down, banks in trouble?
   But some people not only won't use the ``R'' word, treating it
as they would a publicly unutterable reference. And most of them
are associated with the U.S. government and the White House.
   Judging from their statements, they prefer euphemisms. To
President Bush, the economy is in a ``serious slowdown.'' Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, prefers ``meaningful
downturn.''
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic
Advisers, had called the downturn a ``lull,'' but in commenting
late last week on the big jump in November unemployment he
elaborated on his view, to wit:
   ``The decline in employment in November, and the large revision
in the job decline in October, confirm that the economy is
contracting noticeably in the fourth quarter.''
   In contrast, independent assessors of economic activity have
been using the ``R'' word for weeks or months - openly, blatantly,
boldly - for obvious reasons preferring not to wait for the
semi-official definition.
   The obviousness of their impatience is that the definition
relied on by historians and the government - two straight quarters
of shrinking gross national product - isn't available until about
seven months into recession.
   Moreover, what seems to be a growing number of economic analysts
don't give a hoot for the formal decalaration.
   Says economist Robert Barbera of Shearson Lehman Brothers, ``For
our part, we continue to believe that the United States is in the
fifth month of a recession that will extend into the middle of next
year.''
   And Albert Sindlinger of Sindlinger &amp; Co., whose staff
telephones about 4,000 households a month to inquire into their
financial affairs, finds most people believe the economy has been
in recession all year long.
   The question of recession, yes or no, was decided long ago at
the National Association of Realtors, which forecast that the
economy will remain in a recession through much of 1991, with
sustained growth resuming in 1992.
   There are perhaps good reasons why government officials shy from
the word, one being that to declare a recession exists might
exacerbate the situation. Another is that what the government says
is not easily retracted.
   But government has demonstrated in other economic areas a
similar verbal dexterity in the avoidance of unpleasant terms.
   The recent federal budget agreement, for example, was said to
include a five-year, $500 billion deficit reduction, partly the
result of spending cuts. But many independent analysts claim they
can find little sign of reduction.
   ``Believe me, when the fat lady sings, the 1991 deficit will be
higher than it was in 1990,'' says James C. Miller, co-chairman of
the Tax Foundation.
   Miller, who learned a bit about deficits as President Reagan's
budget director, says the main reason is that ``spending will go up
by at least $100 billion - more than the entire federal government
spent as late as 1961.''
   While a ``deficit-reduction package'' that raises deficits might
be seen as an astonishing miscommunication, some commentators
believe a recession that isn't called one until after it's over is
being less than forthright.
   There is nothing sacred about the semi-official definition of
recession. Why, for instance, does it take two straight quarters of
economic shrinkage? ``Isn't a year when there are two poor
quarters, though not consecutive, just as painful?'' asks
investment adviser John Dessauer.
   Meanwhile, there is a chance the current downturn might already
fit one of the broader definitions of recession offered by
Greenspan.
   A recession, he said, is ``a process of deterioration in which
events feed on each other to induce economy into a cumulative
decline.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - ``Artificial life'' sounds like a contradiction.
But the notion that lifelike behavior can be coaxed out of
non-living material is gaining acceptance among scientists. Some
envision a future inhabited by artificial life forms. But what will
that mean for the future of humanity?

   It's a dog-eat-dog world inside Danny Hillis' computer, home to
64,000 competing programs. Only the fittest will survive.
   Fitness, in this 5-foot universe, is the ability to sort letters
alphabetically. But Hillis, its creator, doesn't teach his programs
how to sort. Instead, he sets up a world in which programs with
sorting ability are more likely to survive. Then he waits.
   The early programs are terrible sorters. The worst are killed
off right away. Some put `A' before `Z' by blind luck, but that's
good enough. They ``mate,'' merging successful traits in
``offspring'' that do better still.
   Evolution proceeds at a dizzying pace. The result, after 10,000
generations: ``A better program for alphabetical sorting than
anything I could write,'' says Hillis, a programmer with a
doctorate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   There can be no doubt the software that evolved in Hillis'
computer is superior to anything a human could produce.
   The question is, is it alive?
   Probably not - or as Hillis is apt to answer, not yet. But to
him and other scientists on the frontier known as artificial life,
it's only a matter of time before life becomes - literally - what
we make of it.
   Artificial life, like artificial intelligence, is an attempt to
coax lifelike behavior from non-living material - silicon,
chemicals, even LEGOs.
   ``A-lifers'' - biologists, chemists, physicists, mathematicians
and computer scientists - envision a not-so-distant future
inhabited by evolving software, sentient robots, and life forms
based on chemicals other than carbon.
   ``We are all going to be living in a world filled with
artificial life forms we haven't yet imagined,'' says UCLA
biologist Charles Taylor.
   Christopher Langton of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico predicts artificial life will emerge on its own,
spontaneously surfacing within complex computer networks just as
the first biological life did on Earth 3{ billion years ago.
   His colleague, physicist J. Doyne Farmer, goes even further:
Artificial life could surpass its creators, ultimately occupying
the next rung on the evolutionary ladder.
   The prospect unleashes primal fears of humanity's creations
growing out of control, culminating in our destruction. Researchers
acknowledge the fear. Some even profess to share it, but say the
scientist's role is to press on and hope for the best. ``Humans
have a way of muddling through,'' says John H. Holland, an engineer
and computer scientist at the University of Michigan. ``I suspect
we'll find ways to keep ourselves safe.''
   Despite the science fiction overtones, artificial life research
focuses on furthering understanding of biological life, and much of
it rests on a bedrock of scientific fact.
   ``Scientists used to think that the origin of life was a unique
event - just this bolt of lightning, just that temperature,''
Langton says.
   How life began remains a mystery. But the notion of life as a
natural proess as opposed to a freak accident is among the tenets
of modern biology.
   While no one knows how the first living cell was formed, the
complexity of even the simplest bacteria points to a long series of
small, distinct steps. Picture a Boeing 747 spontaneously
assembling in a tornado-torn scrap yard; that, says British
astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle, is about as likely as a living cell
coming together in a single shot.
   The steps required mandate that life was no accident. ``A
multistep process that relies on one improbable event following
upon the other is bound to abort sooner or later,'' Nobel laureate
Christian de Duve of The Rockefeller University wrote recently.
   The assumption that life is defined by the organization and
interaction of its parts rather than the material it's made of lies
at the heart of artificial life research.
   The first cell was composed of carbon-based polymers, as are we
all, but not because the stuff has mystical properties. ``You can
find the material we're made of all around,'' says physicist Howard
Pattee of the State University of New York at Binghamton. ``We were
made from whatever was handy.''
   ``The material is immaterial,'' says Langton, to whom building
life isn't so different from building, say, a computer.
   ``You can build a computer out of tubes carrying water,
electronic chips or even Tinkertoys. What's important is that you
have the right functions related in the right way. Some of us think
that's also true of life.''
   Then why don't we see new forms springing up all the time?
``Other life either out-competes it, eats it or erases its base of
support,'' Langton says.
   But concoct the right blend of materials in a controlled
environment, he says, and life will emerge. Biologists believe
self-organization is a natural property of matter, though the
process by which it occurs is another mystery.
   ``We believe the chemical soup on Earth, when left alone for
millions of years, sprouted flowers and frogs and people,'' Hillis
says. ``Yet the rules of chemistry are pretty simple. It's hard to
believe something that simple could produce something as
complicated as a person.''
   Understanding how simple rules give rise to complex behavior is
the holy grail of artificial life research, for therein lies the
key to all life, scientists theorize. Already, they are fashioning
complex worlds based on simple rules within the finite universe of
computers, seeking new insights into age-old questions. Some are
using chemicals to model emergent properties. Others are building
mechanical representations.
   The questions they hope to answer are formidable: What is life?
When does it begin? What factors speed evolution? Natural selection
ensures that species improve from one generation to the next. But
what process makes individuals improve? How does adaptation in one
species affect another? If this year's frog develops a sticky
tongue, what does that do to next year's fly?
   Not the least of the questions concerns humanity's future. ``We
tend to assume evolution stops with us. Clearly, that's not the
case,'' Langton says. ``So far, compared to ancient creatures,
we're just a flash in the pan.''
   What does artificial life portend for humans? ``We may be the
first species to create its own successors,'' Farmer says.
   Rest assured, however. Creatures unveiled at an artificial life
conference in New Mexico last winter posed no imminent threat.
   Electronic ``ants'' negotiated a computer-generated maze in a
system called Genesys, created by David Jefferson and Charles
Taylor of UCLA. Each ant was composed of strands of computer code
(``genes'') that determined its ability to move in various
directions. The gens of the first ants were randomly generated,
and most quickly died. The fittest survived to pass their superior
genes on to offspring, and so on. As with Hillis' alphabet-sorting
programs, performance improved as evolution progressed.

   Programs like Genesys show ``it is possible to evolve seemingly
intelligent behavior quickly and easily on a computer,'' Taylor
says. Computers also enable scientists to manipulate population
size, mutation rates, and other factors to see what works best.
   From various evolving worlds, theories emerge: Parasites spark
diversity through adaptation. Predators do well initially, but
cooperators win in the end. Small may have an edge over large.
Adversity is good. ``It's hard to develop an advantage in an
unchanging environment,'' says physicist Richard Bagley of Los
Alamos.
   Computer worlds will be a snap to create with software being
developed at Los Alamos: simulated environments with ready-made
populations programmed to move in various ways. Amaze your friends!
Simulate fish! Ants! Molecules! Preschoolers! ``The same basic
architecture underlies almost all biology - lots of pieces that
interact with each other,'' Langton says.
   Models are expected to quickly become more sophisticated. But
already, complex behavior is busting out all over.
   Squirt is a cubic-inch robot built by Rodney Brooks of MIT's
robotics lab using a few basic rules. Separately, the rules are
innocuous. Together, they add up to a robot with an attitude.
   One rule concerns light; Squirt doesn't like it. Turn on a
light, and the robot goes into a spiral search pattern until it's
safely in darkness.
   Should its microphones detect sound followed by a long period of
silence, Squirt is designed to temporarily override its fear of
light and head toward the sound. The fear then returns.
   Seldom seen by its lab mates, Squirt spends most of its time
sneaking about in a panic, showing up late for meetings and
avoiding the boss - extremely lifelike behavior in many offices.
   Other robots in Brooks' lab include the Collection Machine,
which collects empty soda cans, and the Confection Machine, which
uses money it earns peddling candy to buy services from obliging
humans, such as opening doors.
   Ingenious as they are, today's specimens are reassuringly far
from the nightmares of science fiction. Computers are expected to
achieve only squirrel-like intelligence by the beginning of the
next century.
   ``Right now, artificial life is much simpler than a fungus. It's
nothing like a mouse, let alone a human,'' Hillis says. Even the
most advanced computer viruses, considered by many to be the
precursors of artificial life, are a far cry from life as we know
it.
   The distinction between living and non-living blurred earlier
this year when MIT researchers created the first synthetic molecule
capable of lifelike self-replication. Amino adenosine triacid ester
- AATE - may help explain how organic chemicals acquired the
ability to copy themselves, a prerequisite for life.
   No one would argue that the primitive molecule created at MIT is
a long way from DNA, the elaborate template that carries the
hereditary code for all living things. But as one might expect,
optimism is a common trait among scientists who aspire to breathe
life into LEGOs.
   Their highest-tech tool is the Connection Machine, a $5 million
supercomputer made by Hillis' Cambridge, Mass., company, Thinking
Machines.
   The Connection Machine has 64,000 processors. A personal
computer has one. ``Picture a football stadium full of people, each
with a PC, all computing at once,'' Hillis says. Since each
processor controls the behavior of a program, or ``individual,''
the computer works much like evolution - only faster. In the
Connection Machine, 5 million years of human evolution collapse to
just under 70 hours.
   Its speed and processing capabilities make the Connection
Machine ideal for the ``bottom up'' approach favored by Hillis and
others. ``Traditional science works by taking apart frogs and
flowers to see what's inside,'' he says. ``But it's hard to figure
out what's going on if you don't understand the rules.''
   Rather than take life apart - living things don't respond well
to dissection - artificial lifers hope to put it together.
   Not everyone is enthused. ``Do you want to understand murder by
studying murderers or by committing one?'' says Purdue University
computer scientist Eugene Spafford. ``Artificial life research
shouldn't consist of throwing chemicals into a test tube to see if
something crawls out and introduces itself. There should be
theories behind what's being done.''
   Some are taking a more theoretical approach. Others remain
convinced their tinkering will produce lifelike behavior. But is it
live - or is it Memorex?
   ``Artificial lifers believe you can abstract the behavioral
essence from any particular material. The question is, what do you
lose?'' says Pattee. ``My feeling at present is that artificial
life simulations are so far from the actual organization of living
systems...that to call it artificial life in any more than a
simulation sense is carrying it too far.''
   Though there's plenty of debate, few think the future of
artificial life rests on the outcome. ``There's been a lot of hype
and wild claims,'' says Michigan's John Holland. But there's also
talk of ``beautiful patterns'' and ``elegant experiments.'' ``I
feel like a gardener,'' Hillis says. ``You water and weed and
sometimes you sprout flowers.''
   The garden could prove dazzling.
   Along with furthering our understanding of biology, artificial
life techniques could bring revolutionary advances in medicine,
engineering and computer science.
   Deciphering differentiation, the process by which genes create
different cell types, could lead to engineered life forms capable
of tasks too hazardous for humans.
   Artificial life also could broaden the context of evolution
theory, says Stuart Kauffman of the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine, whose work in this area spans 20 years.
   ``Darwin regarded organisms as tinkered-together contraptions
because natural selection sifts through random mutations and pulls
out useful variations. In fact, there may be principles of order
and organization that lie behind these historical accidents,
universal laws or physics of biology. If we can find the laws, the
medium doesn't matter.''
   Like many in the field, Holland finds his outlook on life
evolving. ``More and more we realize that a lot of what we thought
was spirit and mind is directly affected by physics and chemistry.
   ``If one takes that view of humans, the idea of thinking,
feeling machines becomes more plausible.'' It also, he says, begs
the question: ``Should we as humans bring these things into
being?''
   Between artificial life research and recombinant DNA technology,
``this power to manipulate is growing. The question is how to
manage it,'' says George A. Cowan, president of the Santa Fe
Institute, a private center for studying complex systems.
   Odd juxtapositions abound at the institute, housed in a former
convent. Computers fill cubicles that once were nuns' dormitories;
a chapel's stained-glass windows now illuminate a conference room.
What better place for would-be creators of artificial universes to
ponder moral implications of playing God:
   When does a model of a living thing become a living thing?
Should artificial life fulfill humanity's needs or its own? What is
a creator's responsibility to his creation? To society?
   How would Danny Hillis' programs perceive their universe?
   Whose programs are we?

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Toys are as old as civilization, perhaps older,
and childhood playthings have inspired the careers of innumerable
adults, many of them famous. In his 35th consecutive Christmastime
feature, AP Special Correspondent Hugh A. Mulligan takes a look at
toyland and the long march through history of wooden soldiers and
cuddly dolls, electric trains and model planes.

   On Christmas morning, in front of the marble fireplace in the
nursery at Blenheim Palace, 6-year-old Winston Churchill deployed
his regiments across the carpet and set up ambushes behind the
chair legs, pretending to whip the French again at Blenheim as did
his famous ancestor, the Duke of Marlborough.
   Amused at the child's concentration, his father, Lord Randolph
Churchill, asked if he would like someday to o into the army.
   ``I thought it would be splendid to command an army, so I
answered YES at once,'' Churchill recalled in his memoirs. ``The
toy soldiers turned the current of my life.''
   Wilbur and Orville Wright were still in grade school in Dayton,
Ohio, when an uncle brought from Paris a Christmas present of a
flying mechanical toy by Penaud, the famous French toymaker. After
school, the brothers began selling toys of their own invention to
earn pocket money to buy the science books that would one day lead
to liftoff at Kitty Hawk.
   Young Frank Lloyd Wright erected his first building with Froebel
blocks, introduced by the German educator Friedrich Froebel, who
devised the kindergarten system of learning through play.
   The dream world of toys is the serious business of childhood.
   And fortunately for the now multibillion-dollar toy industry,
many adults throughout history never put away childish things.
   English colonists arriving at Roanoke Island in 1585 greeted the
Indians with gifts of knives, glass marbles and dolls. Among his
furnishings when he came to Philadelphia in 1699, William Penn
packed ``Letitia,'' a doll gorgeously gowned in velvet and brocade.
   Paul Revere, toymaker as well as silversmith, made drums from
nail kegs and baby rattles from gourds. In addition to playing with
kites, Benjamin Franklin had a profitable sideline in his
Philadelphia print shop turning out ``educational playing cards.''
   French novelist George Sand presented 120 plays and designed all
the costumes for her puppet theater at Chateau Nohant. Joseph Haydn
composed operas for Prince Nicholas Esterhazy's toy theater. Johann
Goethe, the German poet and playwright, made all the scenery for
the puppet theater he gave to his son, August, for Christmas in
1800. English cabinet makers Thomas Chippendale and Thomas Sheraton
fashioned elegant doll furniture.
   It is not surprising that those who live by their imaginations
cling more steadfastly to the fantasies of childhood. Cervantes,
Anatole France, G.K. Chesterton and Robert Louis Stevenson were
avid toy collectors. Lewis Carroll was a steady customer at
Creamer's toy shop on Regent Street.
   Toys are as old as civilization; older if you can envision a
brontosaurus pup playing with a round stone like a kitten with a
ball of yarn. Anthropologists assure us that cavemen played marbles
with nuts and dry berries when not dragging live dolls about by the
ponytail.
   Egyptian children were entombed with their beloved toys. The
dolls of early Christians who died young were buried with them in
the catacombs.
   Kites existed in China in the 3rd century B.C. In 206 B.C., Gen.
Han-sin sent up a kite to gauge the distance between his camp and
the palace of Emperor Wel-Yang Kong.
   American clipper ships brought home from China some sensational
new toys that were already centuries old: the yo-yo, the
merry-go-round and a low weighted doll that was impossible to tip
over called ``Daruma,'' after the monk who introduced Buddhism to
China and whose legs were said to have withered away during nine
years of contemplation.
   From the Middle Ages down to the present German toymakers in
Nuremberg, Oberammergau, Berchtesgarden and Sonneberg excelled in
imagination, craftsmanship and merchandising skills. Peddlers with
sacks on their backs like grounded Santas carried toys along the
medieval trade routes of Europe, down the Brenner Pass into Italy.
Some were women, called ``notion nannies,'' who included toys in
their regular line of pots, pans and thread.

   The French were famous for windup toys, marketing a doll that
could ``write perfect penmanship,'' and another who played a melody
on the harmonium, nodding her head as her fingers flitted over the
keys, then stood up to take a bow. Marquis de Vauban, the French
military engineer, devised for the Nuremberg toymakers an army that
could march, fire, reload and even retreat, all in sterling silver.
   Marie Antoinette, who loved and collected toys all her life, was
shown a doll in an artist's smock by Henri Jaquez Druz, whose
mechanical marvels delighted the Spanish royal family and just
missed being condemned as diabolical and burned at the stake by the
Inquisition. The doll proceeded to sketch a credible likeness of
the French queen as she sat for her portrait.
   Alas, Marie Antoinette little realized then that her fate and
that of her husband, Louis XVI, would create a demand for toy
guillotines. Goethe asked a friend to bring him one from Paris.
   Grim toys have been as enduringly popular as Grimm's fairy
tales. Children in ages past played with a live bird on a string,
kept crickets in a cage, trained mice to pull wagons. Puppet shows
made ogres of dwarfs, hunchbacks and cripples. Toy catalogs before
World War I featured a musical model of the Titantic that played
``Nearer My God to Thee'' as it sank in the bathtub.
   Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtle swords and nunchakus, a
multimillion-dollar hit in this year's toy market after the success
of the movie, have been blamed for an increase in playground
violence in Australia and are banned from many classrooms.
   Clay horses and wooden knights fueled the fervor of the 30,000
boys and girls who followed Stephen, a French shepherd boy, on the
Children's Crusade in 1212. Many lost their lives in the deadly
game of trying to free the Holy Land from the infidel.
   Toys of war were part of the education of a prince. Charles V of
France, also known as Charles the Mad, received a toy cannon for
Christmas in 1383. Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire
ordered toy knights that could be dislodged from their horses for
his 10-year-old son Ludwig. Six years later the lad was unhorsed
and killed fighting the Turks. The future Louis XIV received for
Christmas two sterling silver armies, each with a troop strength of
30 regiments of cavalry and infantry.
   Then as now toy soldiers went to war with the most modern
weapons. This year G.I. Joe is mounted on the ``Hum-Vee,'' the
new-model Army jeep widely deployed on Operation Desert Shield in
the Persian Gulf.
   We think of toyland as a fantasy world of make-believe, but the
most successful playthings always reproduced reality as the child
experieced it. Down through the centuries chariots and archers, the
stag hunt and farm and forest scenes gave way to royal carriages,
cowboys and Indians, horse-drawn trolleys, Model T Fords, dump
trucks, highway trailers, jet planes, rockets and space shuttles
and now a laptop computer just like Dad's or Mom's.
   Toymakers keep up with the times. A political cartoon poking fun
at Theodore Roosevelt's sparing the life of a bear cub on a hunting
expedition inspired the Ideal Toy Co. to ask permission to name a
stuffed toy for him. ``I don't think my name is worth much to the
toy bear cub business, but you are welcome to use it,'' the
president answered, underestimating the still potent sales clout of
the teddy bear.
   Along with the merry melody of the cash box, the dream world of
toys has inspired countless poems, paintings, operas, ballets,
plays, movies and pop songs. Robert Louis Stevenson's nostalgic
evocation of his own sickly childhood is among the nicest:
   ``And sometimes for an hour or so
   ``I watch my leaden soldiers go
   ``With different uniforms and drills
   ``Among the bedclothes through the hills.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - It's viewed as a symbol of growing religious
tolerance in the city of the popes, an Islamic house of worship
virtually in the shadow of the Vatican. The architect of the
mosque, expected to be completed next year, is a Roman Catholic who
feels it is one of the most important monuments to be built in Rome
this century.

   An Islamic mosque is rising in this seat of the
Roman Catholic Church, something that would have been almost
unthinkable a few decades ago.
   Not just any mosque. It's a $45 million complex capable of
seating 2,000 and believed to be the biggest Islamic house of
worship in all of Europe.
   And in a historic gesture of Christian-Moslem tolerance, one of
the first visitors to the mosque could be Pope John Paul II.
   ``We will invite him to our inauguration and I am almost
positive he will come,'' says Abdul Qayyum Khan, director of the
Islamic Cultural Center of Italy.
   The ceremony is tentatively set for the spring. The Vatican says
it is too early to say whether John Paul will attend, but stresses
that he is dedicated to pursuing dialogue with Islam and other
religions.
   In any case, the fact that a huge mosque has risen virtually in
the back yard of the Vatican is an unmistakable symbol of mutual
tolerance between two faiths with ancient rivalries.
   ``I think this mosque is one of the most important monuments
built in Rome in this century,'' says Paolo Portoghesi, a Roman
Ca`holic who is the main architect of the mosque. ``It is an
expression of religious liberty and religious dialogue in the
modern world.''
   Yet, delays in the project may have been linked to fears in some
circles that the mosque's minaret would be higher than the dome of
St. Peter's Basilica, located about 2 miles away across the Tiber
River.
   ``There are deep hostilities in some parts of Roman society for
minorities,'' Portoghesi says. ``There have been battles because
naturally not everyone was in agreement on building a mosque in
Rome. We had to overcome many obstacles.''
   The project is about three-quarters finished. Still to be
completed are the minaret, a two-story cultural center and a
landscaped public garden. The complex will include a 500-seat
conference hall and one of the largest Moslem libraries in the
West, with books in Arabic, English and Italian.
   ``We hope everything will be finished within six months, before
next summer,'' says Khan, a Pakistani who is overseeing the
project. ``We hope we will be able to use the mosque for our
festival prayers after the Ramadan.''
   With the arrival in recent years of thousands of immigrants from
countries such as Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, Islam has become
increasingly visible in overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Italy.
   There are no official figures on the number of Moslems in Italy,
and Khan is reluctant to make an estimate. But Italian media
reports have put the number at more than 300,000 nationwide,
including 50,000 in Rome.
   ``We really needed a place where we could say our Friday
prayers,'' says Khan, sitting in a temporary office in a trailer on
the construction site. ``We used to rent apartments or halls but
they could accommodate 50, 60 or at most 100 people. The number was
increasing all the time and we were shifting from place to place
looking for more room.''
   Because immigration is a new phenomenon and many of the new
arrivals survive by taking jobs that most Italians don't want, the
Moslem community is still looking to assert itself in Italian
society.
   One of the most prominent Moslem names in Italy is Prince Karim
Aga Khan, spiritual leader of the world's 15 million Ishmaili
Moslems. Although he lives in France, the Aga Khan developed a
jet-set resort on the island of Sardinia and is a familiar figure
in Italian social circles.
   There are nearly 1,000 Christian churches in Rome, and two large
and six small synagogues. But unlike London, Paris and other major
European capitals, Rome has never had a mosque.
   The idea for a mosque in the city of popes goes back some
decades, but the project didn't start taking shape until the
Vatican announced in 1974 that Pope Paul VI had no objections. The
decision reflected the new openness to other religions set out in
the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council.
   Rome's Communist-led city government of the time then donated an
undeveloped, 7.5-acre plot at the foot of Monte Antenne in the
exclusive Parioli district.
   ``There had been a kind of reluctance to have a mosque in the
heart of the Catholic world,'' Khan says. ``A general argument was
that the Moslems do not permit a church in their own holiest places
like Mecca and Medina. But with the passing of time and the change
of circumstances, the project was deemed necessary.''
   Still, it took another decade before bulldozers went into
action. Work was blocked because conservationists and local
residents objected that construction would ruin the environment and
cause traffic problems.
   The final hurdles were cleared when the Islamic Cultural Center
pledged to plant 100 trees on the site and build a lighted access
road routing traffic away from heavily populated areas.
   When construction finally began in late 1984, officials
predicted work would be completed in three years. But various
legal, financial and bureaucratic problems slowed the project.
   The cost was originally put at $30 million, to be covered by
contributions from Moslem individuals and more than 20 Moslem
countries, led by Saudi Arabia and Iraq with $7 million apiece.
   After the price tag soared to $45 million and the money nearly
ran out, Saudi King Fahd earlier this year personally donated the
extra $15 million needed to complete the project, Khan says.
   The latest delay involves the height of the minaret, a slender,
circular tower attached to the mosque.
   The minaret was designed to be 128 feet high, but the Islamic
Cultural Center was recently told that a special license is
required for any structure over 82 feet.
   For the moment, pending the go-ahead from regional officials,
the minaret remains wrapped in scaffolding and flanked by idle
cranes.
   Khan insists the delay is strictly a matter of bureaucracy and
has nothing to do with the rumors the minaret would be even taller
than St. Peter's. In fact, the dome of St. Peter's is about four
times higher than the planned minaret.
   The minaret has also raised fears among neighborhood residents
that its balcony would be used by a muezzin, or crier, to call the
faithful to prayer five times a day.
   But Khan has promised them the tower won't be used for that
traditional practice.
   ``The inhabitants were a little afraid that we might be calling
people to prayers at 4:30 or 5 in the morning,'' Khan says. ``We
told them, `No, the minaret is just a symbolic thing. Without it,
the mosque is not really a mosque.'''

   ROME (AP) - If Rome's mosque is a mute symbol of
Christian-Moslem harmony, then Paolo Portoghesi is a living symbol.
   Portoghesi, a Roman Catholic and seventh-generation native of
this city of popes, is the leader of the team of architects that
designed Rome's first Moslem house of worship.
   ``This has been the most important project of my career,'' says
Portoghesi, 59, one of Italy's most prominent architects and a
well-known Rome socialite and Socialist Party figure.
   ``The mosque is not only a symbol of Islam's important place in
the world,'' he says, ``but it is also a sign of the new
Catholicism, one that is not rigidly closed to other religions but
is tolerant and open to dialogue.''
   Portoghesi is not new to the world of Islam. He has traveled and
studied extensively in Moslem countries. He teaches Islamic
architecture at the University of Rome and has designed
still-to-be-built mosques in Jordan and Sudan.
   ``When they had the international competition for the Rome
mosque, I participated with enthusiasm because it was a subject I
was familiar with,'' he says.
   The commission of Islamic experts judging the designs eventually
narrowed the choice to two architects, Portoghesi and Sami Mousawi
of Iraq. In the end, the two architects were assigned to merge
their designs into one.
   The result is what Portoghesi describes as a blend of Islamic
and Roman tradition.
   ``We chose forms of architecture which express the dialogue
between the two cultures,'' he says. ``The intertwined arches are
typical of Islam but they also were used centuries ago by Francesco
Borromini. All the material we used, such as travertine, is typical
of Rome.''
   Even the garden, he says, will harmonize the two civilizations:
pine trees of Rome and palm trees of the desert.
   Portoghesi takes more pride in the mosque's artistic traits than
in its imposing size.
   ``It is probably the biggest mosque in Europe, but that is a
distinction that could soon be surpassed by others,'' he says. ``We
don't want it to be the biggest. We want it to be `la piu bella'
(most beautiful).''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - A New Yorker, reverting to his roots, is giving
tender loving care to a tiny mail-order Christmas tree growing in
the windowsill of his Manhattan studio apartment. It won't be big
enough to hold even a single ornament this year, but he figures
that one day it could rival the Rockefeller Center behemoth outside
his office window.

   Outside my office the Rockefeller Center
Christmas tree stands 75 feet high and 35 feet wide. Some 20 blocks
away in my West Side apartment my own tree stands 10{ inches high
and maybe 2 inches wide.
   The Rockefeller Center tree had been growing 61 years since
Shirley Cenci's father planted it in her front yard in Norwalk,
Conn. My tree has been growing about eight weeks now and is just
budding tentative arms along its pencil-thin trunk.
   The Rockefeller tree has 20,000 lights festooned around its full
and bountiful branches. I don't see my tree bearing ornaments this
year, not even tinsel for that matter, but it shows promise.
   There is one larger difference between them, however. This is
the last year for the Rockefeller Norway Spruce. It is the first
Christmas for mine.
   It's in my studio apartment because the price of Christmas trees
sky-rocketed in Manhattan. Last year I only wanted a small tree, 3
feet tops. But the best price was $40. So I went without.
   I thought of decorating one of my house plants, but somehow
ornaments and lights on elephant ears jarred my traditional
sensibilities. Instead, one evening I tuned in a local TV channel
that plays Christmas songs and shows a decorated tree and a burning
yule log. Then I watched ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' and ``Miracle
on Thirty-fourth Street.'' That was my Manhattan Christmas.
   Come New Year's Eve I had no parched tree to carry down to the
basement and no trail of dried needles to be swept up. The maid
liked that.
   But this summer I got a mailed offer of an infant Colorado
Spruce for $1 from the National Arbor Day Foundation in Nebraska
City, Neb. I snapped it up.
   It arrived this fall with planting instructions, a spindly,
helpless thing with only the hint of life. After soaking its roots
for about 10 hours I put it in a pot, watered it and watched
intently. But nothing happened.
   Then ever so slowly it began to stir, like a baby yawning after
a deep sleep.
   No baby gets closer attention. I check its damp soil three times
a day, fight off the urge to water more than once a week. I talk to
it a little like I talked to my children when they were learning to
walk.
   It occupies a prime spot in my studio apartment with southern
exposure and a controlled climate. That should give it a long
growing season.
   Christmas trees were always a part of my life. I even sold them
as a kid in Detroit.
   When the nation was digging out of the Depression, Dad would
wait until Christmas Eve before going out and hunting up a bargain.
He would buy extra branches, drill holes in the trunk, fill in the
empty spaces. Mom would dig out the boxes of ornaments collected
over a lot of Christmases, and we would spend the rest of Christmas
Eve adorning.
   This Christmas I will adorn the base of my tree with a few
ornaments and maybe a string of lights along the bottom of the pot.
It also gave me an idea. I have, for a pittance, ordered a red
maple and a silver maple from the Arbor Day Foundation, for my two
little grandsons. The seedlings should arrive in the spring and
they can watch them grow as they do, the Mike and Matt trees.
   And I have high hopes for Christmases to come. My tree, the
instructions say, is destined to rise to a height of 75 feet. My
apartment has 8-foot ceilings. But I'll deal with that when the
time comes.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - It's not an unfamiliar scenario in the English
countryside. A grand old manor house is sold because the present
owners can't afford the needed repairs and upkeep. But this time
the cast of characters included kinfolk of novelist Jane Austen and
the unloading of the estate ruffled a lot of feathers.

   Alongside silhouettes of long-nosed
women, a worn writing table and a lock of light brown hair, three
signs grace the cottage where Jane Austen wrote her last novels.
   ``Please Note! This house has not been sold and never will be!''
say the handwritten messages. Tucked between exhibits, the notes
allude to family squabbles, money woes and misunderstandings to
rival those from the novelist's own pen.
   Here in this tiny village not far from her birthplace, the
author of ``Pride and Prejudice'' and ``Emma'' lived from 1809 to
1817 in a cottage, now a museum, loaned to her by her wealthy
brother Edward.
   His Elizabethan manor house, soon to be a luxury hotel and golf
club, is up the road. It was the recent sale of the manor house,
named Chawton House, which ruffled a lot of feathers.
   ``I had people ringing up in tears saying, `How could you close
Jane Austen's house?''' says Jean Bowden, the amenable curator of
the novelist's cottage. ``Everybody thought it was us being sold,
not the Great House.''
   Miss Bowden, a botanist, placed the signs in the museum to
squelch rumors. Yet attendance rose as misinformed devotees rushed
to see the museum, run by an independent trust, before it was gone.
   For others, the sale last January truly caused dismay.
   Henry Rice, a great-great-great grandson of the author's niece,
formed a trust last year to buy the manor and convert it into a
Jane Austen research center. But he couldn't meet the asking price
of owner Richard Knight, a descendent of Edward.
   Today, Rice's search for a house in which Jane Austen ``would
have felt comfortable'' continues, both in Chawton and beyond. And
he doesn't see much of his distant relation.
   ``We don't have much to talk about; he's gone one way and I've
gone the other,'' says Rice, a retired farmer. ``He's gone into the
hotel business. ... That's very little to do with Jane Austen.''
   Nor did the author herself spend much time at the Great House.
She liked to stroll about the splendid grounds, and visit when her
brother and his large family were there, but Edward mostly lived at
other estates.
   One of Jane's six brothers, Edward inherited his properties from
a rich benefactor, Thomas Knight. Later, Edward took the name of
Knight.
   Jane Austen was not rich. The daughter of a clergyman, she never
married and had little pocket money until several of her books were
published shortly before she died at age 42 in 1817.
   The writer, with her keen observations of families and human
nature, would well have understood the money woes that drove
Richard Knight to sell the Great House.
   ``Nobody who has not been in the interior of a family can say
what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be,''
she wrote in 1815.
   When Knight, a farmer, inherited Chawton House, he realized he
couldn't afford to repair or keep the 51-room manor, where floors
sag and rain leaks into 16th-century oak-paneled rooms.
   After mulling over offers, Knight sold the house on a 125-year
lease to a colorful entrepreneur, Robert Jarman, and two other
local businessmen who plan to spend about $40 million to convert it
into a 39-bedroom luxury hotel and golf club.
   Under the agreement, after 125 years the Knights will be given
the house, along with gardens restored to their Austen-era splendor
and hundreds of acres of former estate property being re-purchased
for two 18-hole golf courses.
   ``One hundred and twenty-five years is a long time, but in terms
of 400 to 500 years in the family, it's not so bad,'' says Knight,
adding that he believes Jane Austen would have found the
arrangement a ``jolly answer'' to his difficulties.
   ``In a sense we're restoring the estate to his family,'' says
Jarman, a bearded man who charges enthusiastically across the
grounds in his jeep to show a visitor its wild beauty and future
potential.
   Jarman, who calls himself a ``frustrated architect,'' has hired
a Welsh architect famous for his restorations and the two have
worked closely to try to preserve the house. One wing of bedrooms,
for example, will be built into a hill.
   ``I don't want to iron out any of the magic,'' says Huw Thomas,
the architect. ``It's rather like an Agatha Christie set.''
   Gradually, their efforts to ``tread carefully'' won over the
skeptical residents of the village, population 330, and those
living nearby in the rolling hills and pastures of Hampshire.
   ``I had doubts about it originally, because I thought having two
full golf courses in Chawton was a bit much,'' says Colin Allen,
who represents the village on the regional planning board.
   ``But after seeing how carefully it was all thought out, I
changed my mind,'' he says. ``My views were affected by the local
people...They were in favor because it wasn't going to spoil the
village.''
   ``We'd all prefer the family to be living there,'' says the
curator Jean Bowden. ``But the current solution is nice. It keeps
the squire in the village.''
   In her own practical way, perhaps Jane Austen too might have
approved. She once wrote that endings shouldn't ``dwell on guilt
and misery.''
   ``I quit such odious subjects as soon as I can,'' she wrote,
``impatient to restore everybody, not greatly in fault themselves,
to tolerable comfort and to have done with all the rest.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Second only to its steaks, perhaps, Kansas City
in the 1920s and '30s was known for its jazz and swinging nighclubs
featuring the likes of Count Basie and Charlie Parker. There are
still plenty of jazz musicians in the city and several
organizations are struggling to keep the tradition alive, but few
today can make a lic full time.

   When Little Willving making musiie Littlefield wrote the
popular tune ``Goin' to Kansas City'' in the early 1900s, jazz
musicians flocked here for the the good life and plenty of gigs.
   Nightclubs lined the streets and the joints were jumping from
early evening to early morning seven days a week.
   Today, hundreds of jazz musicians and a half-dozen jazz
organizations are struggling to keep Kansas City's jazz tradition
alive. About 400 jazz and blues soloists and more than 70 bands are
competing for a shrinking share of the economic pie.
   The money coming in from the city, corporations and the public
isn't enough to sustain a healthy jazz community in Kansas City,
most musicians say.
   ``The city has a certain amount of money and the jazzt to fame
here in his hometown in the '30s. Count Basie was a regular in the
clubs here.
   But with the end of Pendergast's political career in 1938, after
his indictment on tax evasion charges, came the end of the jazz
heyday.
   Reform elements took over, nightclubs and cabarets were shut
down, jobs for musicians dried up and the Kansas City bands took to
the road.
   Old-timers who remember the jazz scene as it used to be lament
the way things are now.
   Jackson says finding a gig was easy back then, but today not
even 10 percent of the city's musicians can live by music alone.
   ``I feel sad. People as a whole do not support jazz in this
town,'' Jackson says. ``It is pathetic. People like to listen, but
they don't want to spend money for it.''
   ``The city is not living up to the past reputation,'' says Kathe
Kaul, head organizer of the annual Kansas City Jazz Festival.
``It's a different time.''

   Joan Van Ark has nothing but praise for Patty
Duke, her co-star in the CBS movie ``Always Remember I Love You.''
   One day during the filming in Vancouver, Canada, she says, the
two were scheduled for a TV interview. ``I'm sure they were
expecting two dueling divas,'' she says. ``Instead, we came out and
hugged each other.''
   In the movie, which CBS put into the pre-Christmas lineup on
Sunday, they play the mothers of a teen-age boy who discovers by
accident that he was adopted. Miss Van Ark is the adoptive mother,
Martha, and Miss Duke is the real mother, Ruth.
   The boy, played by Stephen Dorff, learns that he had been
kidnapped 14 years earlier in a baby-selling racket and sold to a
couple he had believed were his real parents. He sets out to find
his birth parents, then must choose which family he wants to stay
with.
   ``In the original script Patty and I never meet, but the network
asked for a confrontation scene,'' Miss Van Ark says. ``It's a very
brief scene. The next day I sent Patty flowers and a note that
said, `I'll never forget how you touched Martha's heart and my
soul.'
   ``Patty Duke is such a gift for an actor to have in a scene. She
is there 200 percent. I've never felt such support.''
   Miss Van Ark says one reason she was attracted to the script was
because it supports family values. ``You don't find enough of that
on television,'' she says.
   ``Always Remember I Love You'' also stars David Birney as Miss
Van Ark's husband, Richard Masur as Miss Duke's husband and Sam
Wannamaker as Birney's father. Vivienne Radkoff wrote the
screenplay and Michael Miller directed.
   ``This is one of the most genuinely moving and rooted scripts
I've ever read,'' Miss Van Ark says. ``You don't have to push for
the dilemma. He has two sets of parents, and he has to make a
choice. If we've done our work right the audience will have as
difficult a choice as the boy does.
   ``We had decided not to tell him he's adopted, but he finds out
when the lawyer who arranged for the adoption is arrested in a
child-selling scandal. I tell him how much we wanted a child. It's
a terrible blow, and he bolts out determined to find his real
parents.''
   Miss Van Ark describes her character, Martha Mendham, as
affluent, ``with manicured nails, blunt-cut hair, Chanel suits,
very East Coast.''
   Miss Van Ark, who has starred as Valene on CBS' ``Knots
Landing'' since it began in 1979, is dressed in a bright red plaid
jacket and black skirt for a Christmas video greeting from the
series' cast to the troops in Saudi Arabia.
   ``Bill Devane's living room is decorated for Christmas for the
video,'' she says. ``This jacket makes me look like a Christmas
package. My house is being remodeled and all our furniture and
clothes are in storage. I asked my housekeeper to find me something
red and this is what she came up with.''
   She was also preparing to leave for Bermuda to appear on a Bob
Hope special.
   Miss Van Ark is married to television newsman John Marshall and
their daughter, Vanessa, is in college. They had known each other
since high school in Boulder, Colo., but in college they went their
separate ways. They met again when she was doing ``Barefoot in the
Park'' in London and he was stationed in Germany.
   They were married in Germany and for a honeymoon toured every
European city made famous by her namesake, Joan of Arc.
   She is an accomplished marathon runner, and no matter what her
schedule says she finds time to run because it's ``my therapy.''
   While in high school she interviewed actress Julie Harris, who
advised her to go to the Yale School of Drama. She won a
scholarship right out of high school. Later, Harris played her
mother on ``Knots Landing.''
   Miss Van Ark starred in two earlier series, ``Temperatures
Rising'' and ``We've Got Each Other.'' She made two guest
appearances on ``Dallas'' as a young, down-on-her-luck waitress who
marries into the Ewing family. She was then hired to reprise the
role in the ``Dallas'' spinoff.

<HEAD>At the Movie: `Edward Scissorhands'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Opened Dec. 7 in limited release; opens nationally Dec. 14.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The familiar 20th Century Fox logo appears on the screen with
its art moderne towers and searchlights - in a snowstorm. You know
something unusual is going to happen.
   Leave it to Tim Burton to provide a unique screen experience. He
did it with ``Pee-wee's Big Adventure,'' spectacularly with
``Beetlejuice,'' less so with ``Batman.'' With ``Edward
Scissorhands,'' he explores new avenues of creativity.
   ``Edward Scissorhands'' has all the good-hearted fantasy of
``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,'' which it resembles. In both films a
strange creature appears in an American suburb and is embraced by
some citizens and threatened by others. In the end the visitor is
driven away by human ignorance and misunderstanding.
   Edward (Johnny Depp) is the creation of a benign Dr.
Frankenstein, played with customary flair by Vincent Price. The
inventor equips Edward with foot-long shears and scissors instead
of hands. Before Price can finish the job with human-like hands, he
dies.
   Edward huddles alone in a castle atop a wooded mountain. Then
one day the Avon lady pays a call. She is Dianne Wiest, who lives
with her family in a bland, pastel subdivision incongruously
situated at the foot of the mountain. She takes the bewildered
Edward home and makes him part of the family.
   The other suburbanites are astonished, then delighted with
Edward, especially after he makes statue-like topiaries out of
their trees and bushes, styles the women's hair and poodle-cuts
their dogs. Edward appears on TV and undertakes a beauty salon. He
also falls in love with Wiest's daughter (Winona Ryder).
   Predictably, Edward's new world becomes threatened, bringing a
melodramatic ending that is the least of Burton's concoctions.
   Burton was once a Disney animator - and it shows. Price's lab
and Edward's scissors are masterpieces of movement. The characters
have the sweetness of a Disney film without being cloying.
Especially good are Wiest's ever-optimistic mother and Alan Arkin's
decent, plain-talking father.
   Depp's Edward is haunting with his scarred, melancholy white
face, painted lips and querying eyes. Ryder is appealing as his
wouldbe sweetheart.
   Burton and screenwriter Caroline Thompson have fun with the
rituals of suburbia - barbecues, gossip, etc. The production, by
Burton and Denise Di Nova, is brilliant, with lookalike houses and
costumes color-keyed as they were in Warren Beatty's ``Dick
Tracy.''
   Rated PG-13, for minor expletives and excitement.
   Running time: 95 minutes.

   ``Henry V'' (CBS-Fox Home Video. VHS-Beta, $92.98. Rated PG)
   
   When an example of artistic excellence reaches the screen, it is
a time for celebration. So break out the Cristal, Kenneth Branagh's
``Henry V'' has reached the home video market.
   A spare, well-crafted interpretation of the play by William
Shakespeare, Branagh's movie focuses on the complex young king
rather than the pagentry and expansiveness of the conflict between
French and English.
   Branagh, who directed himself in the title role, sees Henry as
vulnerable, ambitious, compassionate, crafty and highly
intelligent. It is this almost pure intellect that slices through
the gray, misty chill of the battlefield.
   It is quite unlike Laurence Olivier's 1944 classic, made during
the patriotism of World War II. Both are very fine in different
ways. Olivier's is heroic in a direct, chauvinistic way. Branagh's
is psychologically heroic.
   The director's performance is a marvel, full of lyricism and
Shakesperean bravura. The loyalty of a compassionate sovereign
unfolds the night before Agincourt, where the small English force
defeated a bigger French army. And a nice touch: Henry doesn't even
realize the victory. H asks the French herald which side won that
day.
   The power and serenity of Branagh's St. Crispin Day speech might
bring a tear or two, and will definitely cause the skin to tingle.
   There are stunning performances throughout: Ian Holm as
Fluellen, Paul Scofield as the King of France, Brian Blessed as
Exeter, Judi Dench as Mistress Quickly and Emma Thompson as
Princess Katherine.
   Derek Jacobi is the modern-day chorus in this imaginatively
staged movie.
   ``Henry V'' is a video for the home library. Buy it.

   ``Grim Prairie Tales'' (Academy. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   Production notes for ``Grim Prairie Tales'' say the movie's
writer-director, Wayne Coe, was designing film posters ``when he
decided to risk it all and become a filmmaker in 1985.''
   He should have stayed at the drawing board.
   This anthology of stories all taking place in the Old West is so
wooden, so thick, so slow, that it makes the worst TV soap opera
look like a high-speed chase.
   Not even the talented James Earl Jones, who can make a reading
of the telephone book sound like a Shakespearean passage, can turn
this clunker into anything worthwhile.
   Jones portrays a bounty hunter named Morrison, who stops by the
camp fire of a writer named Farley (Brad Dourif) one chilly night.
Farley is on his way to see his wife. Morrison is on his way to
collect a few bucks for the corpse draped over his saddlebag.
   They mix like oil and water and soon discover their one common
ground is storytelling. Morrison goes first with a tale about an
Indian burial ground. The story is supposed to be scary - if you
can stay awake long enough to the end. Scary it ain't. Rambling it
is.
   Farley, though, is all fired up by this one and demands another.
The second story is weird with a sick erotic spin at the end. It's
about the best of the lot but it would never make the semifinals
for a ``Twilight Zone'' audition. The competition is afoot and
Farley boasts that the story he's about to tell is the best. Like
the others in this uncreative celluloid yarn, Farley's story about
a pioneer family and the killing game the menfolk play at night has
a promising start and then fades to nothing.
   The last story is Morrison's, a story about a gunslinger. It's
supposed to be haunting, but is predictable and flat.
   ``Grim Prairie Tales'' lasted only a blink during its ill-fated
theatrical run (make that crawl). Obviously, the producers (Richard
Hahn, whose credit is something called ``Kandyland,'' and Andrzej
Kamrowski, who did a documentary called ``Polanski in Poland'')
intended this project for the video market. But don't fall for it.
If you buy it or rent it, you'll only hate yourself.

   ``Katydids'' (Reprise) - Katydids
   
   To some ears, the next blip in the trend-happy rock world will
be third generation pop-rock bands who owe allegiance to the
Beatles, Hollies and Raspberries. American bands such as Seattle's
Posies have deservedly received attention, but don't neglect the
Katydids from Britain.
   The Katydids' self-titled debut is a sparkling collection of pop
tunes energetically performed. Singer Susie Hug and guitarist Adam
Seymour wrote all 11 songs.
   ``Lights Out (Read My Lips)'' - one of the few songs in recent
years to prominently feature a tambourine - is strong enough that
you overlook the cliche.
   The rockigg ``Stop Start'' and melancholy ``Girl in a Jigsaw
Puzzle'' both deal with the eternal subject of faltering
relationships. ``All Above Me'' and ``What Will the Angels Say''
show a strong religious influence, but, as are many good pop songs,
they are vague enough to have multiple interpretations.
   Producer Nick Lowe, no stranger to strong pop music, has never
been known to fiddle incessantly with an arrangement. He believes
in capturing the most inspired ``take'' and wrapping up recording,
an approach that serves the Katydids well.
   This band won't win any awards for originality: ``Heavy Weather
Traffic'' owes an obvious debt to the Who, and ``Dr. Rey'' could be
matched with the Beatles' ``Dr. Robert.''
   Still, this is a bright debut.
   - By David Bauder, Associated Press Writer.
   ---
   ``Dear 23'' (David Geffen Co.) - The Posies
   
   Like ``Talking Heads '77'' and R.E.M.'s 1983 album, ``Murmur,''
the Posies' major-label debut is a rock milestone, an album that
progressive bands six or seven years from now will cite as an
influence.
   The Seattle-based quartet sets out to redefine the early
psychedelic sound that blossomed in the mid- to late-'60s and
succeeds with thrilling harmonies and jangly guitars. Their chorus
structure on ``Golden Blunders,'' for example, echoes the Hollies'
``I Love Jennifer Eccles'' from 1968.
   But the Posies are not merely a throwback band. Their lyrics, by
singer-guitarists Jonathan Auer and Kenneth Stringfellow, exhibit
refreshing levels of wit and depth.
   The song title ``Golden Blunders'' is a play on the Beatles'
``Golden Slumbers.'' The tune's sobering subject is the heavy
consequences of unprotected sex, pregnancy and early marriage:
``Men and women please beware: don't pretend you care. Nothing
lasts when there's nothing there,'' the Posies warn.
   Much of the material reflects the songwriters' youth. Their main
concerns are love, doubt and separation. But the Posies prove that
even these well-worn subjects can sparkle with some clever
handling: ``She left me alone, claiming we'd run out of things to
talk about. I was crushed of course but at least I've got something
I can write about,'' they sing on ``Any Other Way.''
   It seems appropriate, even inevitable that the Posies hail from
the Pacific Northwest, where many 1960s flower children still
nurture the dream of a new age. The Posies are a part of that
future.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Out and About in West Virginia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nick Nolte lounges in the front row of
benches in the Kanawha County courtroom, one arm thrown over the
back of the seat, watching two lawyers debate a minor point in a
preliminary hearing.
   People know Charleston's most famous resident is down at the
courthouse today; even in West Virginia's biggest city, population
63,000, word spreads fast.
   But they leave him alone. Aside from the judge, the defendant,
two court officers and the lawyers he's studying, the actor's got
the room to himself.
   No fans demanding his attention. No producers demanding his
time. No co-stars demanding he watch them strut their stuff. And,
except briefly, no reporters demanding details of his life.
   And that's why Nolte, who works on the fringe of Hollywood's
image-obsessed film industry and skirts the edge of stardom, finds
himself more at home in the hills of West Virginia than in Los
Angeles or New York.
   ``This whole business concept of stardom: It's a thing I find
very entrapping, very limiting and not worth a damn,'' he said. ``I
really don't function at all in my thinking on that level.''
   Nolte was busy filming ``Cape Fear,'' Martin Scorsese's remake
of the 1962 Gregory Peck-Robert Mitchum film in which an ex-convict
blames a lawyer for his sentence and threatens the lawyer's wife.
Nolte plays the lawyer who defends and betrays Robert De Niro.
   He researched much of the role in his adopted hometown, spending
several days haunting the Kanawha County courthouse and jail to
observe lawyers and judges at work.
   ``I want to see the demeanor (of a lawyer). I want to see how he
behaves in the courtroom, how he behaves with a client, see how
he's thinking. I want to figure out the points of law,'' Nolte
said.
   He has researched roles in Charleston before, including his part
as a homeless man in ``Down and Out in Beverly Hills,'' because he
said he can do it without much distraction and get closer to those
he's studying.
   ``Look, if I was trying to do this research up in New York City,
say, or in L.A. in the court system ... it would be very difficult
to approach it. It's just a much more complex city. It's
impersonalized. It's complicated. It's fast-paced,'' Nolte said.
   ``And I certainly do need a certain kind of pace when I'm not in
the actual process of doing a film. I need a pace where I can think
a little.''
   That's what he gets in West Virginia's capital, a compact city
snuggled along the snaking Kanawha River and sheltered by the
Appalachian foothills.
   Although he owns a house in Malibu, Calif., Nolte retreats to
Charleston, where his wife, Becky, and a previous wife, Sharon
Haddad, both grew up, and he can avoid hobnobbing with the film
crowd.
   To Nolte, living in New York or Los Angeles inevitably forces
actors to compete against each other to prove acting ability and
commercial clout.
   ``One of the reasons I live in West Virginia is to stay away
from that, rather than living in one of the film centers that
constantly talk about this film succeeding and that film, and
whether this guy was good and that guy was good,'' he said. ``I
like to get away from that judgmental kind of thinking.''
   The relaxed lifestyle of Charleston also suits Nolte, who grew
up in a similar atmosphere in Omaha, Neb., and Ames, Iowa.
   ``I play golf and I hike and stuff like that,'' said Nolte, who
played football while bouncing through five different colleges in
the early 1960s. He also loves to fish.
   It's also easier for Nolte, the father, to get out in Charleston
with his 4-year-old son, Brawley.
   ``I have my son up in New York City, and I get him outside the
hotel for a walk in the park, and it's fairly intense,'' Nolte
said. ``Here, I can take him out, let him run on the street, play
in the backyard and the woods. ... In L.A., if I want to take him
to the park, I have to get him in a car and go on a freeway that's
the most traveled road in the world.''
   Nolte, 49, has found himself on some less-traveled roads as an
actor, which he became after abandoning college in 1962.
   He started hanging out at a Pasadena, Calif., theater with an
actor friend - to meet girls, he says - and got hooked on the
stage. A decade of touring the Midwest landed him back in Los
Angeles in 1973, where he finally hit it big in 1976 with the TV
miniseries ``Rich Man, Poor Man.''

   Working steadily since then, Nolte's had hits (``48 Hrs.,''
``Down and Out in Beverly Hills''), misses (``Everybody Wins,''
``Farewell to the King'') and films in between (``Q&amp;A,'' ``Who'll
Stop the Rain'').
   He recently finished ``The Prince of Tides,'' based on Pat
Conroy's novel and directed by and co-starring Barbra Streisand. He
plays a high school teacher and football coach coping with family
problems in South Carolina.
   ``It's about a dysfunctional family,'' he said. ``It's a great
Southern story.''
   Nolte draws upon his experience as well as research to prepare
for roles, although he keeps the personal parts private.
   Through it all, Nolte remains a modest box-office draw, and he
prefers his low-key stardom to something on the level of a Tom
Cruise.
   His biggest commercial successes have come when he's shared the
marquee with Eddie Murphy in the two ``48 Hrs.'' movies, and with
Richard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler in ``Down and Out.'' The films he
carries tend to be offbeat and mildly successful at best.
   He's paid well for his mainstream movies (a reported $3 million
for ``Farewell to the King''), but Nolte said he is ``constantly
contradicting'' a Hollywood mentality that says ``an actor has a
certain salary base, he shouldn't take less.''
   ``That limits the film he can operate in,'' he said. ``When a
film is operating the best, there is no star system. It is an
ensemble. Consequently, if I can go to a film and see the film
without seeing myself, then I think I've accomplished the task of
fitting into the theme of the film.''
   Amiable, joking and accommodating in an interview, Nolte on
screen projects a gruffness and intensity that intimidates.
   But he uses variations on that persona to compile a diverse
portfolio of characters: a noble drug runner in ``Who'll Stop the
Rain,'' a beatnik in ``Heart Beat,'' a playwright convict in
``Weeds,'' an egocentric artist in ``New York Stories.''
   ``The trouble with stardom is that it has a tendency to
pigeonhole you. It has a tendency to classify you. It dictates a
certain kind of popularity,'' Nolte said.
   ``Basically, you want to play characters and stories that
intrigue you, and whether that man is a leading man or an evil man
or whatever, you want to approach those roles that fulfill you and
those stories that fulfill you.''
   Once filming is over, Nolte moves on to the next role and does
not look back.
   ``Those roles I did before, I wouldn't want to play them now,''
he said. ``It's chronological. As I grow old as a person, that
story was the interest and the focus at that time. That's why I had
to tell that story, that's why I got involved.
   ``Now, in no way could I now go back and do `Who'll Stop the
Rain' and think in those terms. I don't quite think the same way,''
Nolte said.
   Laughing, he added, ``I'm probably a little more corrupt.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Ailey Lives Through Jamison</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judith Jamison was the biggest star the Alvin
Ailey American Dance Theater had in its 32 years. She is now at the
helm of the modern dance company as it twirls through its first New
York season with an artistic director other than its founder.
   Jamison was named artistic director after Ailey's death last
year on Dec. 1. The season had gone on that month, as planned, in a
kind of shocked state for both dancers and audiences.
   Since Labor Day, the company has performed in the Soviet Union,
France, England and Kansas City. In Denmark, it videotaped
``Episodes'' and ``For Bird With Love'' for showing by PBS next
February.
   Two works Ailey choreographed, including ``Hidden Rites,'' are
being revived for the current season, and five new dances are being
added, ranging from ``Impinyuza,'' Pearl Primus' 1952 paean to the
royal dancers of the Watusi in Ruanda, to ``Read Matthew 11:28'' by
young Kris World, who danced and sang on a Stevie Wonder tour.
   There are also works by Donald McKayle, Lar Lubovitch for his
own company and Jamison for the Jamison Project, the 12-member
dance company she had before being called to head the Ailey.
   ``I'm excited about the season,'' she said in an interview.
``Sometimes the company is only known as a high-energy-burning,
exciting company. `North Star' by Lar is a softer way of moving.
They look beautiful doing that.
   ``The people dancing in the company now - who've been here on an
average of four or five years - haven't danced Primus. Dudley
Williams has; he is working on his 26th year here. I think she is
one of our unsung heroines of dance as well as a great
anthropologist. I wanted to present the men of the company in a
piece that was Afro-centric. They're magnificent.
   ``Alvin's `Hidden Rites' is from the John Parks-Jamison era. It
hasn't been done since then. It's part of Alvin's vocabulary these
dancers had never visited. Dudley was the last person to dance
Alvin's `Hermit Songs.' Three dancers will alternate it this
season. It's about a monk.''
   Next season Jamison plans to revive ``The Mooche,'' set to music
by Duke Ellington. Jamison left the Ailey in 1980 to co-star in
``Duke Ellington's Sophisticated Ladies'' on Broadway.
   The hardest thing Jamison has to do as head of an established,
respected company of 28 dancers, is delegate responsibility. ``When
I joined in 1965, there were 10 dancers and everybody did
everything. Alvin needed something, you did it. Now I have a staff,
a development director, public relations and Masazumi Chaya, the
miracle of this company, rehearsal director the last four years. He
can remember details and dances like no other.
   ``I'm very good at molding the end result of rehearsals. I say:
`You know the steps. Let me coerce you into dancing it. If you
bring your entire being to this movement, you're going to take a
step in a direction you haven't been in before.'''
   Jamison thinks it helps that she's a former dancer, as was
Ailey. ``The dancers know that I remember what it's like to be in
their shoes. They let me get on stage with them a couple of minutes
in `Read Matthew.'''
   Six dancers from the Jamison Project have joined the Ailey
company. ``It's a nice injection of energy,'' Jamison says, hastily
adding, ``not that this company needs energy. It is nice to have
some fresh blood.
   ``Alvin had the same idea I did; you want a Cecil B. DeMille
cast of thousands. But the budget calls for 28.'' The six dancers
from the Jamison Project learned 15 dances in six weeks.
   ``That's when you realize that `Revelations' isn't as easy as it
looks,'' Jamison says. ``Revelations,'' which Ailey choreographed
to spirituals in 1960, is called an American classic by Jamison.
They loved it in Russia, she said. ``It does the same thing to
everyone all over the world.''
   ``We will always do Alvin's masterpieces, `Revelations,' `Cry'
and `Blues Suite,' and the repertory is going to be fed,'' Jamison
said. ``I think it is important the company does not sit as a
museum piece. Alvin Ailey was to me a free spirit, a man who had
extraordinary theatrical sense and a generosity beyond belief.
There aren't other companies with men of his stature asg his
peers to make dances for the company.
   ``I think one of his major contributions was that he made dance
accessible. People who wouldn't naturally go to dance would come.
They'd have their lives changed and how they feel about theater
dance changed. Part of my goal is to continue touching the hearts
and minds of people, especially young people.''

   When George Steinbrenner shared a guest star
slot on ``Saturday Night Live'' with them this fall, the jokes were
inevitable. Will the deposed New York Yankees owner manage The
Time?
   ``He was looking for a new team,'' said Time keyboardist Jimmy
``Jam'' Harris. ``We told him we had a bass player and he thought
we said first base. We're ready to go now. We told him we'd wear
hats and stuff.''
   Despite Steinbrenner's well-known habit of firing managers and
coaches, lead singer Morris Day made it clear who'd be the Boss in
any such business arrangement.
   ``Artists don't work for managers,'' Day said. ``Managers work
for artists. If there's going to be any firing, we'll be doing
it.''
   Control is an important word in the Time's vocabulary, and not
just because it was the title of the Janet Jackson album that
brought Harris and partner Terry Lewis fame as producers. This
reformed Minneapolis septet feels more on top of its career than
ever before - for better and worse.
   The Time's return is a rarity in pop music circles. The reunion
didn't take place because band members were desperate for money.
And it resulted in an album, ``Pandemonium,'' that's clearly better
than any of the three records the band recorded prior to its 1983
breakup.
   ``Pandemonium'' is a raucous funk-rock stew spiced by the slick
comic sense of the sharp-dressed Day, who dubs himself the
``aristocratic black.'' The single ``Jerk Out'' has already hit the
Top 20, and ``Chocolate'' is the second single.
   ``We left the ball lying on the field and nobody picked it up
after we broke up,'' Harris said. ``We felt the ball was still
there so we pumped a little air in it and we're back.''
   The ballgame, to the Time's eyes, is an update of such old
favorites as James Brown and Sly and the Famil Stone played by men
who cut their teeth on real instruments - instead of the sampling
wizards Harris and Day disdain.
   Harris said band members remained friendly following the 1983
dissolution and credited Lewis with badgering the group into a
reunion.
   ``That took a little bit of time to get back together, because
you're talking about brothers that are used to splitting money
maybe one or two ways now splitting it seven ways,'' Harris said.
``It makes it a little more difficult. In the final analysis, I
don't think this had anything to do with money.''
   The Time's merger was like a high school reunion where everyone
succeeded. Day, spurred by his role in Prince's ``Purple Rain,''
has moved into acting. Harris and Lewis can decorate their
Minneapolis studio with Grammys won as producers. Guitarist Jesse
Johnson has hit the top of the rhythm and blues chart and, like
keyboardist Monte Moir, has his own production career.
Percussionists Jerome Benton and Jellybean Johnson round out the
band.
   Lurking behind the scenes is Prince, the band's unofficial
eighth member.
   Individual success helped the band's technique and confidence
and, Harris said, changed the relationship with Prince.
   Although Prince used the pseudonym Jamie Starr for credit on
Time albums and members coyly denied his influence, the Time
originally was little more than Prince's hired hands. Harris and
Lewis, in fact, were both fired from the Time by Prince when bad
weather prevented them from returning from a production date in
time for a concert.
   ``There's really not any animosity,'' Harris said. ``It's nice
to be able to come back into it and I guess have Prince's respect.
He played an important part of us being in a position to do what we
did.''
   On ``Pandemonium,'' the Time avoided taking any individual
credit for the songs. Prince's spokeswoman, Jill Willis, said
Prince wrote five of the songs on the album, including ``Jerk Out''
and ``Chocolate.'' The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that
``Jerk Out'' was originally recorded in 1986 for another band on
Prince's Paisley Park Records.
   When Day was jokingly asked if he would be worried about being
fired by Steinbrenner, he said it was Prince who should be
concerned.
   But Harris said Prince didn't force himself on the band.
   ``Before, we didn't really have a choice - he was the one giving
us the breaks and he was calling the shots,'' Harris said. ``We
felt in order to have all of the elements that made the Time
successful before he had to be involved.
   ``He came into it as an equal partner this time - as the eighth
member of the group, so to speak - rather than as the boss. We were
more like on equal footing. That was really nice.''
   The Time returned their former boss' favors, performing on
several songs on Prince's ``Graffiti Bridge'' soundtrack. They're
in the movie, too, just as they were in Prince's breakthrough
``Purple Rain.''
   While solo success frees band members from depending on the
Time, it also has its downside. It leaves the band's future up in
the air. The day before the ``Saturday Night Live'' appearance,
band members held a summit to discuss going on tour.
   The conclusion? No conclusion. A tour is still a possibility,
but nothing is planned and it won't happen until at least next
year, said band spokesman Gene Shelton. It's a question of all
seven members coordinating their schedules, he said.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Lawrence Block Takes a Darker Turn</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not long ago Lawrence Block wrote a mystery
series chronicling the travails of one Bernie Rhodenbarr, a burglar
who constantly broke in somewhere only to stumble across a murder
and implicate himself.
   Rhodenbarr, of course, had to solve the murders to protect his
neck.
   The tone was amusing.
   Not so Block's books about ex-cop Matthew Scudder. The mood in
those, including his eighth and newest one, ``A Ticket to the
Boneyard,'' is decidedly different.
   ``Dark, I suppose, is the word,'' Block said in an interview.
``The one that is coming out next year, `Down on the Killing
Floor,' is done and it's also a very dark book.''
   Much of the darkness in ``Boneyard'' flows from the villain,
James Leo Motley, a remorseless killer who relentlessly and
cleverly hunts down his victims.
   ``People have said he is the most fully realized villain that
I've done,'' Block said. ``He's not based on an acquaintance. I
have not met this chap and do not want to.''
   He wrote the first three Matt Scudder books in 1974.
   ``He and I had points in common,'' Block said. ``He lives in a
hotel on West 57th Street. When the series began, he was recently
separated from his wife and children and recently retired from the
New York Police Department and drinking a lot in a saloon on Ninth
Avenue.
   ``I was living on West 58th Street, recently separated from my
wife and three daughters and spending a lot of my time in the very
saloon that Scudder hung out in.
   ``In other ways, our background and nature were very different.
I've married since then, seven years ago. Scudder has not. I quit
drinking; I quit before he did. When I started writing the books it
never occurred to me that either of us would ever stop.''
   Block proudly recounts that policemen have told him they like
the Scudder series. ``They say the way he acts and reacts and the
way his mind works is very believable.'' Block briefly was an
auxiliary policeman in New York.
   Scudder is interesting to write about because he evolves, his
creator says.
   ``The books are as much about him as they are about the cases,''
Block said.
   ``That was not true of classic private detective fiction.
(Raymond) Chandler wrote that a detective should be someone who
exists as a window through which we see the world. I think that was
fine when Chandler did it. I wouldn't be interested in writing that
kind of book.''
   He said he is pleased people often ask for more books on Bernie
Rhodenbarr, who last appeared in 1983's ``The Burglar Who Painted
Like Mondrian,'' his favorite.
   Block said he thinks he's done with Rhodenbarr, but he also
thought that about Scudder after the sixth book in that series,
noting: ``I don't have a lot of control over what I write next.''
   ``My typical writing pattern is that I'll write a book in a
month to six weeks and spend the rest of the year thinking about
the next one. The enjoyable time is the two to three weeks between
having finished writing a book and starting to agonize over the
next one,'' he said.
   He started writing and selling stories while at Antioch College
in Ohio. He dropped out for a year to work as an editor for a New
York literary agency, and continued to write. Back at Antioch, he
said, he couldn't focus on school work.
   ``My interest was writing and I grudged the time I had to spend
on assignments and classes,'' he said. ``The school suggested I
might be happier elsewhere. I've been writing ever since.''
   He was always able to make a living.
   Hollywood made the Scudder novel ``Eight Million Ways To Die''
into a movie starring Jeff Bridges and changed the hero to a
heroine to cast Whoopi Goldberg in ``Burglar,'' taken from ``The
Burglar in the Closet.'' One of Block's early books, ``Deadly
Honeymoon,'' was filmed as ``Nightmare Honeymoon.''
   He also wrote seven books in the late 1960s and early '70s about
Evan Tanner, a free-lance spy, and one of those may become a movie.
He wrote four about Chip Harrison. ``Two are comic novels about a
young man's coming of age. I liked writing that voice so much I put
him to work for a private detective and wrote two mysterie.''
   He also has written some books not in series. But publishers and
bookstores like series, he said.
   ``It makes it a little closer to brand-name advertising. There's
a pre-existing audience for each volume,'' he said.
   ``Readers like the same, only different. I find that myself as a
reader. Sometimes if a writer will come out with a new series book,
I'll read it. I want to spend time with those characters.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Misty Rowe Finds Solace on `Hee Haw'</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   When a joke falls flat on ``Hee Haw,''
the producers sometime look to a curvy, blond, Southern belle to
squeal.
   More than once her squeaky voice has saved a laugh that
otherwise would have been flat cornpone.
   Misty Rowe plays that perky role as if she was born to it. But
behind the beautiful facade is a woman who has overcome some giant
obstacles.
   The childhood lisp was conquered years ago, though a trace
remains. The death of her unborn baby last spring, however, was a
setback that took months and a cross-country move with which to
come to terms.
   Oddly enough, she's found solace in ``Hee Haw'' from an
understanding cast and crew.
   The baby would have been the first for Rowe and her husband,
James DePaiva, an actor who portrayed Max Holden for three years on
the soap opera ``One Life to Live.''
   The couple dealt with their devastation by relocating from New
York City to her original home in the Los Angeles area. DePaiva
even gave up his role on daytime TV.
   And in June, Rowe returned to the ``Hee Haw'' set in Nashville.
   ``At first it was difficult,'' she recalled in an interview in
her dressing room. ``But people encircled me and treated me so well
and tried to make me happy.
   ``Sam Lovullo, the producer, kept playing jokes on me. It was a
family-type atmosphere. It was very nurturing and healing. It was
like having 12 sisters.''
   As a child, Rowe was an unlikely candidate for an entertainment
career that eventually made her a familiar face on TV.
   ``I quit talking for a year when I was 12 because people made
fun of me,'' she said about her lisp. ``It was torture as a
teen-ager.''
   She took speech therapy and finally corrected the lisp, although
a trace is still evident.
   ``Everybody is born with something, and it could have been much
worse,'' she said. ``Everybody has something to overcome.''
   With that problem behind her, she went on to ``Hee Haw'' and 200
other roles on TV, usually portraying carefree characters on such
shows as ``Happy Days,'' ``Matt Houston,'' ``Airwolf,'' ``When
Things Were Rotten,'' ``Fantasy Island'' and ``Love Boat.''
   On ``Happy Days,'' she was Wendy the roller-skating car hop in
1974 and 1975, but few viewers knew it was her. ``A lot of people
have seen it but don't recognize me because I wore a very short
wig,'' she said.
   Rowe also has appeared in nine movies, including ``National
Lampoon's Class Reunion'' and ``Meatballs II.''
   She portrayed Marilyn Monroe in ``Goodbye, Norma Jean,'' 15
years ago.
   ``She was sweet and beautiful and she was the epitome of what is
feminine for that time and for today,'' Rowe said about the
fascination with the late sex symbol. ``She had a glow about her.
When she was on camera, you wouldn't watch anyone else.
   ``In the '90s, we want women to be stronger and to take care of
themselves, but she still represents the beautiful, vulnerable
woman.''
   On the long-running ``Hee Haw,'' Rowe is probably best known for
a segment in which she sits in a brass bed telling fairy tales.
This evolved into another spot showing her as a teen-age baby
sitter telling the tales.
   ``It's nice when I do personal appearances and kids come up to
me and ask for a bedtime story,'' she said.
   ``The show has given me freedom, and a home. People recognize me
from `Hee Haw.' Films come and go, but `Hee Haw' is sort of
eternal. It's been on so long.''
   Her squeaky voice has become a trademark on the syndicated show,
which is in its 23rd season. The hour-long program, with country
music interspersed among the humor, is seen by millions on
approximately 220 stations, usually early Saturday night.
   ``It's mine and I have to keep it,'' she said, laughing about
her voice. ``It's high, a unique experience. Sometimes when jokes
don't work, they write on the cue card, `Misty squeaks.' They think
this saves it or something.
   ``I was once introduced to Stevie Wonder. He couldn't see me but
he could hear me. He said my voice is like little bells. It was so
nice.''

   Filmmaker St. Clair Bourne will be story
supervisor and artistic consultant for ``Bellevue Emergency!'', a
new television cinema-verite series in production.
   The ``reality-based'' series, being filmed in the emergency ward
of Bellevue Hospital and elsewhere in the New York area, will have
a continuing story but will feature real people instead of actors.
   Bourne recently returned from Brazil where he was honored with a
retrospective of his work at the Cineclube Estacao Festival in Rio
De Janeiro. Twelve of Bourne's films were presented, including
``Making `Do the Right Thing','' ``Langston Hughes: The Dream
Keeper'' and ``The Black and the Green.''
   ``Bellevue Emergency!'' will premier later this month on ABC.

   NEW YORK (AP) - CTI, once an important record label for
cross-over jazz artists in the 1970s, has been revived with the
help of a Japanese conglomerate.
   Creed Taylor's comeback was made possible through a joint
venture with CTI Wave, a subsidiary of the Saison Group, which owns
the Wave Records chain. PolyGram will distribute.
   The first project for the revived label is an ambitious
audio-visual work called ``Rhythmstick.'' It features 18 artists,
including Art Farmer, Dizzy Gillespie, Flora Purim, Tito Puente and
Phil Woods.
   During its heydey, CTI released records by such jazzmen as Chick
Corea, Grover Washington, Ray Charles, Bob James, Herbie Hancock
and Hubert Laws.

<HEAD>Migration Trends Changing for Retirees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rose Silverman is a Florida booster, no
doubt about it.
   The 81-year-old exercise instructor offers morning aerobics
classes and encouragement to seniors six days a week in the shade
of a tile-roofed bathhouse on a beach that has drawn tourists for
decades.
   ``The ocean, the climate, these were the biggest attractions,''
said Silverman, who retired here in 1967 from New York's Long
Island. ``As you see, I'm very enthusiastic about Florida.''
   But the face of retirement migration is changing, and old
drawing cards like Miami Beach are no longer guaranteed to be flush
with retirees.
   ``If you look at the destination of those who actually tend to
move long distance, the Sunbelt is still the predominant
destination,'' said University ofFlorida geography Professor
Stephen Golant.
   But he believes regional migration patterns through 1985
indicate new retirees are becoming less likely to pack up and move
south. Combine that with a Depression-era baby bust about to reach
retirement age, and Golant sees change ahead in the Sunbelt's
retirement image.
   Other experts on elderly migration see economic value in
welcoming the retirees and predict greater competition among
destinations.
   ``The fact that the retiring cohort is going to be somewhat
smaller means that they're going to be fiercely competed for,''
said David Savageau, author of ``Retirement Places Rated'' and an
employee relocation consultant based in Gloucester, Mass. ``The
losers here, maybe they don't think of themselves as losers, would
be archetypal retirement states such as Florida.''
   Until recently, private enterprise dictated retirement
destinations with developments and marketing tailored to seniors.
   But some states and communities are making retiree recruitment a
public policy priority, convinced of the economic value of 65- to
75-year-old residents, Savageau said.
   Offering Hot Springs, Ark., as an example, Savageau said,
``Their identity lies in attracting retired people and attracting
tourist business.''
   ``The same thing can be said for Asheville, North Carolina, and
Blacksburg, Virginia, places in the mountains that people would
just fly over otherwise.''
   Savageau disagrees with Golant's belief in a migration decline.
``I think retirement migration is going to increase even though
there are fewer numbers of retirement persons,'' he said.
   But they both see economic consequences as one older person in
94 moves to another state, based on 1988 census figures.
Researchers say that translates to 275,000 to 400,000 moves a year.
   Golant sees the primary impacts on housing, because the migrants
need new places to live, and on recreation and leisure,
``everything from golfing to vacations,'' because they have the
free time, the money and generally good health.
   Savageau added rankings on employment in the third edition of
his book after finding a fourth of those who start claiming Social
Security still work and an additional half would like to work.
   Job availability helped propel 12 Florida communities into his
top 1990 rankings. Texas and Arizona have three slots and North
Carolina two in the top 30.
   The aging population also will boost spending on ``everything
having to do with health care and in-home nursing care,'' which
could become a political liability by increasing demand on state
budgets to support Medicaid, Golant said.
   Regionally, he said: ``The Northeast and Midwest will still, of
course, be out-migration areas. ... There's nothing on the horizon
that suggests more people will move into your New Yorks and your
Chicagos.''
   In the Sunbelt, Golant noted, ``There are an increasing number
of retirement locales, such as the Carolinas, which would offer
alternatives to people compared to Florida.''
   Savageau believes Californians may be ready to jump ship to
capitalize on their home equity, and he is seeing some backlash
against established retirement havens.
   ``Look at these little places like Kalispell, Montana, or
Blacksburg, Virginia,'' he said. ``They're very nice places. Sure,
they don't have the year-round climate that San Diego might have,
but they're still an alternative to Florida or Arizona or south
Texas.''
   But back at the beach, Mrs. Silverman's mind is made up.
   ``I feel those elderly people, if they have to go through those
winters up north with the snow and frost and be indoors with the
steam heat, it definitely shortens their lives,'' she said.
  ``Here, the pure air and the outdoor living and all the
activities offered for elderly people, there isn't a person who
wouldn't find something they are interested in. You name it, it's
all here. It's here in Miami Beach.''

<BYLINE>By JOHN CHALFANT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ohio Department of Aging wants to find
out how the older residents are getting along and what the
government should be doing to help them.
   The agency hired the Survey Research Center at the University of
Akron to conduct a telephone poll of people 60 and older. About
4,200 residents will be questioned in 25-minute interviews in
January, with an additional 1,500 polled in a second phase, said
Susan Lewis, chief of the department's division of communications.
   Results are due in late February and March.
   ``We basically don't have any information beyond the 1980 census
and it's not specific enough to our audience that we need to
serve,'' Ms. Lewis said.
   Detailed information from the 1990 census will not be available
until late 1991 or 1992.
   Information will be gathered from survey participants about
health, living situation, and support they receive. Specific
questions still are being drafted.
   But Ms. Lewis said respondents likely will be asked about
whether they have to use a walker, or wheelchair, whether they can
drive, and how well they see. Also subjects such as care received
from children or friends.
   Federal funds will be used to pay the $145,637 cost of the poll.
   ``I see it basically as a planning tool. (Before) we go in and
try to design systems of care for the future to serve the needs of
the elderly, I think the first step is to listen,'' Ms. Lewis said.

<HEAD>Cranberries for Much More Than Sauce</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE WESTON WILSON</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   What's ruby red, sparkles like a jewel and can appear in holiday
cooking in everything from a punch to a glorious dessert?
Cranberries.
   So often we limit these popping beauties to a sweet sauce for
turkey. Yet cranberries with their sharp, bright taste combine with
many ingredients.
   For example, when you combine cranberry cocktail juice with
orange sherbert, ginger ale and club soda, and float oranges in the
punch bowl, you have a not too tart, not too sweet punch for the
whole family. Of course, you can also add spirits.
   Maybe you haven't thought of cranberries in soup before, but
they are wonderful as cranberry borscht, a super entree for a
holiday occasion. An unusual cranberry dish is a cranberry salsa to
spice up any roast: turkey, ham, pork tenderloin.
   By the way, any cranberry sauce recipe can be spooned over a
roast for the last half-hour of baking to make a lovely glaze. And
for the crowning touch for dessert - cranberry jubilee, flambeed
with brandy and served over ice cream.
   Don't forget to string cranberries along with popcorn for
homemade decorations for the tree and store some packages in your
freezer to enjoy all winter long.

<HEAD>Seed-Swapping a Gardener's Art in Winter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BRIA</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Indiana woman is looking for a
mild-tasting yellow tomato with red streaks. In Kentucky, a
gardener wants tan-colored seeds of long, stringless bean her
grandmother used to grow. A Missouri woman asks help in finding a
Hungarian poppy with multiple heads.
   With luck, these people will find the seeds before another
planting season comes around. All across America gardeners are
engaged in a fruitful wintertime activity - swapping seeds through
magazine columns or trying to rediscover the seeds of lost flowers
and vegetables.
   At headquarters of the National Gardening Association in
Burlington, Vt., editors are preparing a special seed-swap and
search listing for their magazine this winter. They hope in this
way to clear up a backlog of requests crowded out of regular
bimonthly editions.
   Associate Editor Vicky Congdon says a staff horticulturist first
tries to find the answer to a search inquiry in the association's
library of hundreds of old catalogs and other sources. If he finds
a source, he'll contact the inquirer; if not, the query gets
printed in the magazine, National Gardening.
   ``People tend to use the swap column to meet other gardeners.
They establish friendships. It's a way to get in touch with people
who are interested in the same hobby,'' said Editorial Assistant
Diane Walker, who prepares the popular feature.
   She said a woman mourning the death of her husband offered seeds
of an Italian heirloom tomato he used to grow. ``I did not have a
need to swap, but only a need to share,'' the woman said. Ms.
Walker said the response was overwhelming, and this tomato
flourished again in friendly gardens.
   The column provides glimpses into the lively diversity of things
Americans are growing, some with names you might never see in the
latest catalogs.
   An Oklahoman offered ``seeds of black long bean and purple pod
pole snap bean, red peanut bush dry bean, black turtle bush dry
bean, red calico pole lima bean (very prolific), scarlet runner
bean, Clemson spineless okra, whippoorwill cowpea, and American
flag leek.''
   And a Californian said he had ``seeds of cinnamon, lemon,
licorice and holy basil ... mixed aquilegia, cosmos, cornflower,
bishop's lace, double larkspur, single and double hollyhock, single
and double gloriosa daisy, sweet William, mixed amaranth and green
tassel amaranth to trade for heirloom tomatoes, beans or any
perennial good for cut flowers, or for any variety of goldenrod or
a white-flowered variety.''
   From Hawaii came an offer to swap coral tree seeds for canna
seeds. The coral tree would grow in frost-free areas.
   Seed swapping has a venerable history in America. Thomas
Jefferson's Garden Book is rich with references to seeds he
received or offered. On Dec. 14, 1812, for example, he wrote to a
friend, Charles Clay, ``I do not remember to have seen Salsafia
(salsify) in your garden, and yet it is one of the best roots for
the winter.
   ``Some call it oyster plant because fried in butter it can
scarcely be distinguished from a fried oyster. I send you some
seed. It is to be sowed and managed as carrots and to be taken up
at the same time and put away for winter use. ...''
   In our computer age, some gardeners use electronic ``bulletin
boards'' to post their swapping or researching requests. Answers
may pop up on their screens the next day or a month later,
contributed by on-line gardeners using the same network.
   Much seed swapping, of course, goes on without recourse to
magazines or modems, gardening being a neighborly pastime. A
Frenchman who lives near me introduced me to shallots known as
frogs' legs because of their shape and large size. Ten years ago, a
barber gave me seeds of a luscious white eggplant he got in Sicily.
   That barber has since retired, but a new barber - also a
gardener - promised me a container-grown, dwarf fig tree. For it, I
swapped some advice on keeping weeds out of an asparagus bed by
mulching with salt hay.

<HEAD>Jury Awards $15 Million in Nursing Home Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AHOSKIE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nursing home has been ordered to pay $15
million to a patient's estate for failing to give him pain
medication in the last days of his life.
   The family of the late Henry James charged that the staff at
Guardian Care was negligent in reducing and withholding James'
prescribed dosage of morphine to ease pain from terminal bone
cancer. James, of Murfreesboro, was 75 when he died in June 1987.
   The nursing home is operated by Hillhaven Corp., with
headquarters in Tacoma, Wash.
   Hillhaven spokesman Tim Carroll said last month that the
Hertford County Superior Court jury's award ``bears no relationship
to the facts presented and we believe it will be overturned on
appeal.''
   Carroll said the company operates 343 nursing homes in 38
states.
   Ron Manasco, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, said the award
was one of the largest in the country in the area of nursing home
care.
   The family maintained that the home's nursing director told
James he couldn't have his regular dose because he might get
addicted.
   The court jury awarded $7.5 million in compensatory damages and
$7.5 million in punitive damages.

<HEAD>Older Workers May Reduce Employer's Health Insurance Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employing older workers does not cost much
more in health insurance expenses than employing younger ones and
may actually reduce an employer's health insurance costs, a study
says.
   It concluded that differences in workers' health insurance costs
among age groups were not great enough to be a major factor in
employment decisions.
   The study, commissioned by the American Association of Retired
Persons, compared insurance costs of younger and older workers,
reviewed federal studies and examined data from Blue Cross-Blue
Shield's Federal Employee Program.
   Health insurance costs for older workers compared favorably to
younger workers in part because the older employees generally had
fewer dependents. ``In addition, hospital admission rates and
lengths of stay have been falling rapidly for older Americans,'' it
said.
   The study found instances in which hiring older workers could
actually reduce employer health costs, including:
   - Hiring older single workers. The study said the
highest-expense single-worker group, those aged 60-64, costs less
than the lowest expense family group, parents aged 25 or younger.
   - Hiring older workers eligible for Medicare which will pay most
of the medical bills for those over 65.
   - Hiring older workers covered by another employer, including
those workers covered in a spouse's or other household member's
health care.

   The worst two-month stretch of layoffs since
the 1981-82 recession pushed civilian unemployment to a three-year
high of 5.9 percent in November, the government said.
   Payrolls fell by 267,000 last month, the Labor Department said
Friday, after a 180,000-job loss in October. Since June, when the
unemployment rate was 5.2 percent, nearly 1 million Americans have
joined the ranks of the unemployed.
   Following the grim news, the Federal Reserve and a handful of
banks moved to cut interest rates.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Growth in consumer credit slowed to a
seasonally adjusted $1.47 billion in October, the government
reported. Analysts said it was another sign of a weakening economy.
   The Federal Reserve on Friday said consumer credit grew at an
annual rate of 2.4 percent, down from a revised 4.6 percent rate
posted in September. The September rate was even slower than the
4.9 percent advance originally reported.
   Revolving, or credit card, debt increased $1.56 billion, or an
annual rate of 8.6 percent, down from a 12.9 percent gain in
September and a 13.3 percent advance a month earlier.

   DETROIT (AP) - More than 30,000 auto workers, nearly all of them
at General Motors Corp. plants, will have next week off as the auto
industry wrestles with a recession.
   GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said Friday they plan to
shut down all or parts of a dozen assembly plants for the week of
Dec. 10, keeping 32,380 workers at home. The closures stem from
slow dealer orders.
   GM also said it will lay off 50,470 workers when it shuts down
18 assembly factories in 14 states the week of Dec. 17, the last
week before the industry's traditional shutdown between the
Christmas and New Year's holidays.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A jury Friday awarded $6 million to a state
supreme court justice, saying The Philadelphia Inquirer defamed him
in a reprint of a 1983 series about the court's conduct.
   The jury, which deliberated nine hours over two days following a
seven-week trial, found the reprint was false and defamatory, but
that the original series was not false.
   The award was the second libel judgment against the Inquirer
this year. William Hangley, the Inquirer's lawyer, said the paper
will appeal the verdict.

   NEW YORK (AP) - R.H. Macy Co. Inc. said it lost $56.5 million
during its first quarter as the retailer's sales, hurt by the
weakening economy and the Middle East crisis, tumbled nearly 10
percent.
   The closely held Macy, which is still paying the costs of a 1986
leveraged buyout, said its loss in the quarter ended Oct. 27
translated to $38.53 per share and compared with a shortfall of
$33.1 million, or $23.92 per share, in the same period a year
earlier.
   Macy's results in the latest quarter, reported Friday, reflected
a $10.2 million gain related to a repurchase of some of the

   Pratt &amp; Whitney forges an alliance
with Germany's Daimler-Benz to develop a new generation of
high-thrust jet engines.
   General Electric Co. sues, claiming the deal violates its
agreement with Daimler-Benz. Then GE drops the suit, and announces
this fall it is exploring a joint venture with Pratt &amp; Whitney to
develop a supersonic jet engine.
   Like countries forging alliances against a common foe,
jet-engine makers are joining forces in ever-changing combinations,
making it almost impossible to know which companies are rivals and
which are partners.
   Joint ventures help engine-makers share astronomical development
costs, which results in superior engines by combining the
technological strengths of various companies, and even widen a
company's customer base by giving it access to a rival's loyal
customers, industry experts say.
   ``Things are happening very fast,'' said David Vadas, an
economist with the Aerospace Industries Association, a
Washington-based lobbying group. ``When you have the big boys -
Pratt &amp; Whitney, GE and Rolls-Royce - going into joint ventures,
there is no turning back.''
   Development of a new jet engine costs between $1 billion to $2
billion. The development costs for the supersonic engine that GE
and Pratt &amp; Whitney are contemplating could reach a staggering $4.5
billion.
   Perhaps 80 percent of jet engines built over the next two
decades will be produced by international partnerships, said Mark
A. Bobbi, an analyst with Forecast International in Newtown, Conn.,
which follows the aerospace industry. That eventually will increase
to almost 100 percent, he said.
   ``The nature of new engines and new aircraft almost dictates it,
because of the costs and risks,'' Bobbi said.
   Sales of commercial engines could amount to between $100 billion
and $150 billion during the next 15 years, Bobbi said.
   Jet-engine makers form two basic kinds of alliances. The most
common is known as a risk-sharing partnership, in which a number of
companies contribute parts, technology and financing for an engine
that bears one company's name.
   But several partners also may form an independent company that
produces its own engines, like East Hartford-based International
Aero Engines, created in 1983 by Pratt &amp; Whitney, Rolls-Royce Ltd.
of Great Britain and others.
   GE pioneered the trend in 1971 by teaming with Snecma, a French
rival, to form CFM International. CFM produces the highly
successful CFM56 series for short- to medium-range twin engine
planes like the Boeing 737.
   East Hartford-based Pratt &amp; Whitney launched its first civilian
partnership in 1973, teaming with Daimler-Benz and Fiat Aviazione
of Italy to build high thrust engines for wide-body jets. Volvo
Flyg Motor of Sweden eventually joined the consortium, which builds
the PW2000 series for planes like the Boeing 757.
   By 1988, Jane's All The World's Aircraft, an industry
publication, listed six major jet engine manufacturing alliances.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp., is
involved in seven major partnership programs. GE is now working on
at least five jointly produced engines.
   An alliance between Pratt &amp; Whitney and GE would be the most
surprising of all. The two companies have been slugging it out
since the 1970s for primacy in the jet-engine market.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney controlled 100 percent of the market until 1970,
but GE is now regarded as the biggest jet-engine maker. Pratt &amp;
Witney logged $12 billion in orders and options last year, vs.
GE's $15 billion.
   The companies announced in October they were exploring joint
development of a supersonic jet engine to power planes faster and
bigger than the French-British Concorde, powered by an engine built
by Rolls-Royce and Snecma.
   ``There was no way either company could do it alone from a
technological or financial viewpoint,'' said Donald Rudolph,
managing director for development and planning at Pratt &amp; Whitney.
``Everybody recognized it is so big that you need help.''
   The companies informed the U.S. Justice Department of their
plans, but said they don't anticipate antitrust problems. If the
deal goes through, they will be working together on the supersonic
engine only, and will compete in other areas. Generally, antitrust
issues don't arise because the partners are from different
countries.
   Joint ventures can breed superior engines by combining the best
technology of the various partners, said Craig Hekking, another
analyst with Forecast International.
   Take the V2500 engine built by International Aero Engines.
Besides Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce, IAE partners include
Motoren und Turbinen Union, Daimler's aerospace division; Italy's
Fiat Aviazione; and Japanese Aero Engines Corp.
   The V2500 engine, put into service in 1989, is built in modules
- with each partner responsible for a specific section. The engines
are then assembled at Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce plants.
   Rolls-Royce builds the high-pressure compressor, Pratt the
combustor and high-pressure turbine. Japanese Aero Engines Corp.
contributes the low-pressure compressor system, while Motoren und
Turbinen Union builds the low-pressure turbine. Fiat Aviazione
builds the gearbox.
   Engine-makers also don't seem very worried about rivals' gaining
access to their trade secrets.
   GE raised the issue in its $1.2 billion lawsuit against Pratt &amp;
Whitney, which it dropped after Daimler-Benz agreed to continue
consulting with GE, but on smaller engines. But others say most
engine-makers are roughly equal in terms of technology.
   Because engines like the V2500 are built in modules, a company
contributing one piece wouldn't know how the other modules are put
together, said Nick Tomassetti, the former IAE president who is now
back at Pratt &amp; Whitney.
   IAE has received $7.5 billion worth of orders for the V2500 so
far, and expects orders to reach $20 billion by 2004.

<HEAD>Judge Expected to Approve Eagle-Picher Class-Action</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge is expected to consolidate
65,000 asbestos claims against Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. in a
controversial step toward settling the nation's biggest product
liability issue, lawyers said.
   But victims' attorneys said Sunday they would move immediately
to appeal a class-action order by U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein and try to block a proposed settlement plan they say
provides inadequate compensation.
   Under the proposal, Eagle-Picher would place $625 million over
20 years into a settlement trust fund that also would contain at
least 25 percent of Eagle-Picher stock. Plaintiffs lawyers said it
offers too little money and lacks protection should the company
default or declare bankruptcy.
   The Cincinnati-based industrial products maker says it faces a
Chapter 11 bankruptcy court filing if no solution to its asbestos
liability is reached soon. Eagle-Picher has sold off millions of
dollars in assets to pay claims, but says it no longer can meet its
obligations.
   Kenneth Feinberg, a mediator in the case appointed by Weinstein,
said he expected the judge to approve a class action as early as
today and tentatively accept the settlement pending a series of
hearings on its fairness. The hearings are to be held in New York,
Cincinnati and another city and last from four to six weeks, he
said.
   Individuals involved in the case said Weinstein also would
freeze all litigation against Eagle-Picher and bar the company from
paying out any asbestos claims pending approval of a final
settlement.
   Weinstein wants to create a class action to settle all cases at
once, which would eliminate costly trials that are diverting money
that could be used to pay victims. Eagle-Picher's case likely would
be used as a model for other companies with large asbestos
liabilities.
   About 90,000 asbestos cases clog federal and state court dockets
nationwide in what legal experts say is the biggest product
liability issue in U.S. history. Another key step involves a
reorganization of the Manville trust fund, which faces 130,000
claims but has run out of cash, that is pending before Weinstein.
   Several plaintiffs lawyers said victims would receive more money
if Eagle-Picher reorganizes under federal bankruptcy laws than
under the proposed settlement. They said they would fight
Weinstein's class-action certification in the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   ``The plan under any kind of objective scrutiny by anybody
familiar with business or familiar with asbestos litigation is
grossly unfair to the victims,'' said Gene Locks, a Philadelphia
plaintiffs lawyer.
   ``Victims will come out multiples better through a (bankruptcy)
reorganization,'' he said.
   Under the plan, Eagle-Picher would pay $460 million over 20
years, $120 million from operations and $45 million to meet already
negotiated settlements. Payments would not begin until November
1993 at the soonest.
   The plan was negotiated and approved by only two of four
attorneys appointed by Weinstein to negotiate with Eagle-Picher on
behalf of victims. Plaintiffs attorneys nationwide met over the
weekend to plan how to fight Weinstein, who they said appointed the
two lawyers in an effort to force through a plan.
   Attorneys said they would challenge Weinstein's authority and
handling of the case, as well as that of the two court-appointed
victims' lawyers who negotiated the settlement, who have little
experience in the 20-year-old asbestos litigation.
   ``There is a feeling among some plaintiffs lawyers that the
judge is not objective and he is so much committed to finding a
solution to the problem of asbestos litigation that the objective
that should be there isn't,'' said Peter Angelos, a Baltimore
lawyer who opposes the plan.
   Lawyers said the law firm of one of the attorneys, Stanley
Chesley of Cincinnati, had a conflict of interest because it
represented Owens-Illinois Inc., a major asbestos defendant
company.
   Chesley said his firm represented Owens-Illinois more than 20
years ago on a non-asbestos matter and the company was not a
current client. He said his lack of experience in asbestos was
irrelevant. ``The issue is what's best for the claimants from an
independent viewpoint,'' Chesley said.
   Current and future claims by victims of lung cancer and other
respiratory ailments against Eagle-Picher are estimated at about
175,000. The company has spent $540 million in the last five years
on asbestos obligations and its future claims are estimated at $600
million.

<TEXT>
   John Fairfax Group Proprietary Ltd.,
which owns the Sydney Morning Herald and three other major
Australian publications, was placed into receivership Monday after
banks called in outstanding debts.
   John Fairfax, one of Australia's two major newspaper groups
along with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd., owes about 1.7 billion
Australian dollars, or $1.31 billion, to its creditors.
   Company officials said directors asked for the appointment of a
provisional liquidator for the group's finance division after banks
refused to agree to a rollover of a debt of 850 million Australian
dollars, or $654 million.
   The Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu accountancy firm was then appointed
receiver and manager at the request of John Fairfax Group's banking
syndicate.
   The ANZ Bank and Citibank are owed about 1.2 billion Australian
dollars, or $850 million. The remaining debt is in the form of
high-yield, high-risk bonds.
   John Fairfax, Australia's oldest media organization, also owns
the Australian Financial Review, Business Review Weekly and The
(Melbourne) Age as well as the Herald in Sydney. The Herald is the
oldest English-language newspaper in the world continuously owned
by the same family.
   In early October, the company reported a net loss of 59.08
million Australian dollars, or $45.49 million, for the year ending
June 30.
   On Aug. 25, three top John Fairfax officials - Chief Executive
Chris Anderson, Chairman Brian Kelman and director Bob Johnston -
resigned amid continuing disputes on renegotiations of the debt.
   John Fairfax's problems have been mirrored at Murdoch's News
Corp. Ltd.
   In early October, Murdoch merged four of his newspapers into two
round-the-clock productions in Sydney and Melbourne. The moves came
amidst a plunge in the value of News Corp. stock that wiped out
more than 2 billion Australian dollars, or $1.66 billion, of the
company's market capitalization.
   Murdoch has been talking in recent weeks with bank lenders about
restructuring News Corp. debt and hopes to have a deal by early
next year.
   Other media outlets in Australia have fared poorly as well. Two
of the major private television stations are in receivership and
have fired hundreds of staff. The third recently reported a loss of
618 million Australian dollars, or $511 million.

<HEAD>China Announces Plans For Another Stock Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A third Chinese city announced plans Monday to
open a securities exchange as interest in stock and bond markets
rebounds from a period of official discouragement.
   Shanghai is scheduled to open China's first full-fledged
securities market on Dec. 19, and the Shenzhen Special Economic
Zone plans to open one next year.
   The newcomer is the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone, located near
Shenzhen in southeastern China's Guangdong province. The zones are
areas that have more freedom than most cities to experiment in
economic reforms.
   Zhuhai Mayor Liang Guangda said a task force is preparing to
open a securities market next year, the official China Daily
reported. The report indicated the market will focus on stocks,
unlike the upcoming Shanghai market that will handle mainly
government bonds.
   The new markets will consolidate transactions, currently handled
by dozens of small, unlinked counters in major cities.
   Liang's announcement reflects the new security market fever
after more than a year of official coolness toward market-oriented
reforms in general. After crushing a popular democracy movement
last year, the conservative leaders who came to the fore denounced
capitalist influences on society and the economy.
   In recent months, however, authorities have begun viewing
securities markets as a useful tool for raising much-needed
capital. They are most interested in using the markets to sell
state treasury bonds to help cover a growing budget deficit.
   Last week, the government started up a nationwide computerized
bonds trading system. There has been heavy publicity in the
official media about the new system and the coming Shanghai market.
   Authorities are less enthusiastic about stocks because they
transfer ownership of companies from state hands to the private
sector. The government allowed the first stock issue under
communist rule in 1985 and a brief period of stock fever followed,
but most issues were made available only to employees of the
companies involved and are not actively traded.
   Economists recently have revived interest in stocks by
presenting them as a way of tapping private savings to aid
industrial expansion and modernization.
   The official China Daily newspaper last week published an
argument by a group of economists on behalf of stocks and markets.
The newspaper boldly likened the new interest in all kinds of
securities to ``a prairie fire spreading across the country -
irresistable and irreversible.''

   Sales of Volkswagen's new Passat model in Japan
have been too low to proceed with plans for Nissan Motor Co. to
begin assembling the cars here next year, spokesmen for the two
companies said Monday.
   Current sales of about 200 a month make the start-up costs for

We think that if the current sales trend continues, there's no

   Through its dealer network, Nissan is to continue selling
Passats imported from Germany. Volkswagen initially had expected
sales of about 700 a month for the Passat, introduced in May as a
successor to the Santana model.
   The two companies said their cooperation in other areas such as
technology would continue.
   ``If in the future something comes up, we will be ready to
negotiate with Volkswagen as ever,'' said the Nissan spokesman
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Nissan was to have begun assembling knockdown kits of the Passat
next summer as it assembled and sold the Santana from 1983 to 1989.
   A Volkswagen spokesman confirmed low sales were the reason for
suspending plans for Nissan to assemble the Passat.
   Volkswagen imports and markets its other models in Japan through
an independent agent.

   The stock market headed lower today, picking up
where it left off in its pullback late last week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 20.30 points
Thursday and Friday, slipped another 8.91 to 2,581.19 in the first
half hour today.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 407 up, 651 down and
496 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.82 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market climbed to 2{-month highs last Wednesday amid rising
hopes for an orderly resolution of the showdown in the Middle East.
   But then prices began to retreat as traders seemed to conclude
that the mood of optimism, and the rally, might have gone to
unwarranted extremes.
   That wariness was reinforced today by word from an Iraqi
official that his country was not ready to compromise ``one iota''
on its position in Kuwait.
   Brokers also noted that investors were still digesting Friday's
monthly report on the employment situation, which painted a gloomy
picture of the outlook for growth and corporate profits.
   The Labor Department said the civilian unemployment rate jumped
0.2 percentage point to 5.9 percent in November, and that nonfarm
payroll employment took a bigger-than-expected drop of 267,000.
   Losers among the blue chips this morning included Boeing, down
1{ at 44; General Electric, down &lsqb; at 57&rsqb;, and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, down \ at 29|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .62 to 178.45. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .29 at 306.16.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 12.38 to
2,590.10, reducing its gain for the week to 30.45 points.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the NYSE, with
745 up, 771 down and 504 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 164.95 million shares, against 256.38
million in the previous session.

   For the past year, since the fall of the Berlin
Wall, tourists have been rediscovering an older, more traditional
Europe to the east. A reporter who recently took a cruise on the
Black Sea from Bulgaria to the Soviet Crimea found a certain charm
amid the chaos of a changing economy.

   There's a small hotel - in fact, there
are hundreds of them that only a year ago were private villas and
holiday retreats for Communist commissars, privileged artists and
favored trade union leaders.
   Now the vacancy sign is out for tourists from the West, or the
Far East, since the yen is as welcome as the dollar, the pound and
the mark. But, please, no levs - the locals disdain the local
currency.
   And the high-rise Communist Party House, as much a fixture in
every Bulgarian city and town as the hulking statue of Lenin, now
has offices to rent to shipping firms, travel agents, exporters and
all kinds of entrepreneurs pouring into Eastern Europe since the
fall of the Berlin Wall.
   ``This is no longer a communist country; we are a developing
democracy,'' says Dmitri, our guide from Balkantourist, the state
travel agency, as he leads a band of tourists off a cruise ship
through the ruins of Roman baths. In the second century, Varna,
then called Odessos, was a rest center for the Roman emperors'
legionnaires.
   A little later he leads us up a precarious trail to a
cliff-hanging medieval monastery called Aladja.
   Suddenly last summer, all over Eastern Europe, monasteries and
churches and palaces that had been held in ideological scorn for
half a century came back in favor. Those that had been used to
store grain or billet troops, or had been converted to museums of
atheism, were being swept out and refurbished.
   And in beach resorts all along the Black Sea coast from
Bulgaria's Turkish border to the Soviet Crimea, dreary high-rise
hotels in stolid Stalinist gothic are scheduled for
``privatization.''
   Ibusz, the Hungarian state tourist agency, is on the block to
raise capital to launch capitalism. Dresden is trying to unload
from its main square a 22-foot-high head of Karl Marx, but so far
has found no takers.
   German golfer Bernhard Langer, the 1985 Masters champion, is
prospecting for future course layouts in Hungary, Czechoslovakia
and what was East Germany. The royal and ancient game, banned for
decades in communist climes, already is in full back-swing on an
island 21 miles up the Danube from Budapest at a 9-hole course
named ``Szentendre'' - St. Andrews.
   ``Here in Varna,'' Dmitri says, ``we already have a German beer
garden, an English pub, a Greek taverna and an Indian restaurant.
We think many tourists will be coming. Our climate is much milder
than the French Riviera. You can swim until mid-October.''
   On a balmy fall day several bathers were slithering down water
slides and landing splat in mud baths along the wide beach called
Zlatri Piassatsi - Golden Sands.
   Hoping to match neighboring Romania's oil finds, drillers gushed
up only mineral springs here. Some Austrian tourists happened by
after World War II and insisted the waters cured rheumatism and
baldness. A spa was born.
   Shepherding his flock into a shopping arcade where some lace,
embroidery and leathercraft were displayed, Dmitri expresses the
hope that Bulgaria's younger generation will ``hang in there'' (his
newest English idiom) long enough to reap the rewards of a
free-market economy.
   ``More than 100,000 left the country last year,'' he says. ``A
million more may go next year.''
   Outside, a young man was peddling ``rare icons'' that stained
his jacket with their fresh coat of gilt.
   In a square near the Ethnographic Museum, the proprietor of a
little van advertising ``beer, herring and brandy'' gave a sadder
picture of the inflated local currency. He had no beer and no
herring, but a plastic cup of slivova, strong plum brandy, netted
you change from a one-lev note, valued at 14 cents.
   Arriving at Yalta in the Crimea, the cruise passengers wondered
about the future of the 80 health resorts and sanitaria operated by
various trade unions and government agencies. Nestled in the pine
forests on the bluffs were villas and dachas of top-level
commissars and apparatchniki.
   Our Intourist guide worried a little about privatization since
individual Soviet republics now have been given control of their
own tourism. But she doubts that foreign visitors will ever take
over what she called ``the comrades' Coney Island.'' Last year, she
said, 2 million vacationers came to Yalta, adding that ``our local
joke is that they sunbathe standing up.''
   She was eloquent on Yalta's health-giving climate: ``Winds off
the Crimean Mountains filtering through the pine forests mingle
with the Black Sea breezes to produce an atmosphere that has been
scientifically proven to be beneficial in the treatment of stress,
rheumatism, asthma and cardiovascular ailments.''
   Russian playwright and short-story writer Anton Chekhov came for
treatment of the tuberculosis he aggravated walking all night in
the snowy streets of Moscow in despair over poor notices for ``The
Seagull.'' Leo Tolstoy convalesced in a nursing home up on the
bluffs and was read to under the pines by novelist Maxim Gorky.

   In keeping with the new reverence for palaces, we had to don
burlap mukluks to glide across the parquet floors of the Alupka
Palace, the two-faced edifice that Count Vorontsov had his British
architect dream up. It has a Tudor castle facade on the north side
and a ripoff of the Moorish Alhambra overlooking the sea on the
south.
   Leaving the grounds we were besieged by hordes of young black
marketeers flogging caviar, champagne, amber jewelry, Russian army
caps and more ``genuine antique'' icons.
   ``Hey Oncle Sam, you want hero medals?'' called out a boy barely
in his teens, opening his coat like a prohibition bootlegger to
display a lining resplendent with medals, ribbons and decorations.
``No? What about a meel-itary vatch?'' He pushed up his sleeve and
revealed an armload reaching beyond the elbow. ``Maybe you give me
choon-gum or a Marlboro cigarette.''
   Our guide warned against ``pickpockets, money changers who will
give you pre-revolution Ukrainian notes, and similar bad peoples.''
   Since Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev lifted the lid on
communism's pressure cooker all sorts of ``bad peoples'' have
bubbled to the surface in the Soviet Union. Crime has risen nearly
40 per cent. In some larger cities, where burglaries are up 80
percent, the citizens are forming neighborhood crime patrols.
   The police, always despised but now ridiculed and rationed to 5
gallons of gas a day for their patrol cars, keep such a low profile
that highway accidents have increased fourfold.
   Director Vladimir Malinin of Intourist recently reported that
because of the crime situation bookings dropped 40 per cent in
1990, and American visitors were down to 100,000 from 180,000 the
year before.
   Heavy morning fog at Odessa on the northern rim of the Black Sea
delayed the docking of our ship, the Cunard liner Vistaford.
   Because we arrived late ``and the driver is not permitted
overtime,'' our guide vetoed a photo opportunity at the foot of the
famous Potemkin Steps. Twice as wide at the bottom as the top, the
staircase projects a splendid optical illusion of even greater
height than its 455 feet.
   Grigori Potemkin, Catherine the Great's favorite general,
ushered in the golden age of tourism on the Black Sea in
inaugurating the new harbor at Sevastapol in 1797. He floated
foreign dignitaries down the Dnieper on 80 Roman galleys, painted
red and gold, each with its own orchestra.
   Since some of the new towns planned for the Crimea were still on
the drawing board, Potemkin had facades of fake buildings erected
and transported in thousands of peasants to populate his ``Potemkin
villages,'' a sort of Disneyland on the Dnieper.
   Our guide dismissed an enchanting Orthodox cathedral with golden
onion domes as ``not important'' and attempted to hurry us into the
hard-currency Beryozka shop, which sold vodka, fur hats, amber
jewelry and other luxury items available only to foreigners.
   The way was blocked by a very drunken comrade being rushed along
by two friends in almost as bad shape. He teetered from their grasp
and fell on his face in the gutter, blood gushing from his cuts.
   ``Somogan!'' spat out our guide in disgust. The word means
moonshine vodka, a popular black-market item in the wake of
Gorbachev's temperance campaign.
   Saturday evidently was marrying day in Odessa. Dozens of wedding
parties emerged from a government registry office to pose for
pictures on the lawn and under the porticoes of the handsome opera
house, one of Europe's finest.
   The brides in long white gowns, the grooms in formal wear, soee
with top hats, arrived in horse-drawn carriages and vintage
limousines, gaily decorated with flowers, streamers and silver
bells.
   Some alighted from taxicabs and the tandem three-car trolleys.
One bride was delivered by an ambulance driven by a friend or
relative. Most bridal couples were in their 30s and beyond.
   ``They marry late because there is a long wait for an apartment,
sometimes 10 years,'' a taxi driver told us. ``Many will move in
with relatives.''
   Downtown Odessa, with its broad boulevards, chestnut trees and
the fading elegance of its hotels, museums, opera house and older
apartments built in czarist baroque, retains the charm of an older
Europe. But that vanishes as one proceeds past the university to
the grim blocks of tower apartments in communist concrete.
   Gradually the clock is being turned back in Odessa. Rival
political parties are beginning to emerge. Proletariat Street has
changed its name back to French Boulevard.
   Before bidding us farewell, the lady from Intourist delivered
one of those stupefying tour-guide statistics that trouble your
sleep like the rumblings of an underdone blini: ``Unsurpassed in
its curative qualities, the mud of Odessa has long been recognized
as the world standard for mud.''
   East of Berlin, local color is where you find it.

   The small factory floor looked empty beneath
the hum of 24 electric looms. Repeatedly the visitors called out.
At last a head of black hair surfaced amid the clattering streams
of bright white fiber.
 to the Afghan resistance, Peter
Tomsen, was expected in Pakistan on Tuesday. He was prepared to
explain any superpower announcement to the Afghan guerrillas who
have been trying since 1978 to overthrow the Soviet-supported
government in Kabul, the sources said.
   ``We anticipate an announcement. It's been in the cards for
sometime. It may or may not happen this time. We're poised but it
could be another false alarm,'' one diplomat said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The announcement had been expected during last month's
Baker-Shevardnadze talks in Geneva but was delayed by differences
over how to cut off weapons to both warring sides, they said.
   Moscow sent about 115,000 troops into Afghanistan in December
1979 to prop up successive Communist governments trying to impose
radical reforms on the largely rural Moslem population. After the
Red Army's pullout in February 1989, Moscow continued to pour an
estimated $2 billion to $3 billion annually in weapons and supplies
to support troops loyal to President Najibullah.
   Western diplomats and guerrilla leaders once confidently
measured the survival of Najibullah's government in weeks and
months. But the guerrillas were unable to switch from their
hit-and-run tactics to conventional warfare and were rendered
helpless against the well-equipped and well-trained Afghan air
force.
   Within months of the Soviet withdrawal, the anticipated
guerrilla victory became a costly military stalemate that failed to
produce a clear victory for either side.
   With the guerrillas controlling the countryside and Najibullah's
troops holding the cities, the superpowers began searching for
diplomatic formulas to extricate themselves from a war that has
left more than 1.5 million people dead and sent nearly 6 million
Afghans into exile in Pakistan and Iran.
   Diplomatic sources say the drafted declaration is purposely
vague and advocates no concrete peace plan for the Afghans,
fiercely independent tribal people who throughout history have
resisted, often violently, the tutelage of outsiders. The final
chapter of the war, they said, will be written by the Afghans.
   ``Why should the two superpowers involve themselves in such
details? Why not leave it to the Afghans?'' another diplomat said,
also speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Pressure has been increasing for both sides to clear Afghanistan
from the superpower agenda before the Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait, the source said.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Board of Trade as players awaited news
about a possible offer of U.S. export credit guarantees to the
Soveit Union.
   Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze were meeting in Houston for talks that were to
include a discussion of credit guarantees.
   Export credits could allow the Soviets to make new purchases of
U.S. grain but the Bush administration has not decided whether to
grant the credits or, if they are granted, how much food they would
enable the Soviets to buy.
   Presdient Bush said late last month he would consider waiving a
requirement that the Soviets abolish emigration restrictions before
becoming eligible for U.S. export credits.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 1{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.54 a bushel; corn
was unchanged to 1 cent higher with December at $2.27 a bushel;
oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with December at $1.11\ a

<TEXT>
   Veteran cotton ginner W.C. Gunter stood
in disbelief as he watched over millions of tiny white pillows
being harvested in the rolling fields of this West Texas farming
town.
   ``The crop wasn't supposed to be there this year,'' Gunter said.
``Mother Nature gave us the greatest Christmas gift we could ask
for.''
   Twenty-one dry days of above 100 degrees in June had threatened
most of the 3.2 million acres of cotton in the 25-county region,
which produces a quarter of the nation's cotton. But sporadic
rainfall in late July and early August helped the withering plants.
   The late-summer moisture, combined with a warm, dry fall,
revived the crop into what is expected to be one of the strongest
yields in the last decade.
   Crop observers are forecasting a total yield of 2.7 million
bales in Texas, which is the nation's biggest cotton producer.
That's up 69 percent over last year's 1.6 million bales and 4
percent above the U.S. Department of Agriculture's October estimate
of 2.6 million.
   As massive combines traveled row by row gobbling up the cotton
crop, Gunter pointed to an acre and predicted it would yield 1{
bales of the fluffy white fiber. A few days later he learned the
acre yielded 2{ bales.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Gunter, co-owner of Plainview 400
Cotton Gin, which expects to clean and press 10,000 bales of
harvested cotton from area farmers, five times as much as last
year.
   ``Most all the farmers I talk to in this area are still in
shock. It's the best crop I have seen in years,'' Gunter said.
``You look at an acre and think it will yield a bale and a half and
then it yields two and a half. It's just fooling everybody. And
there is no way it should be this good.''
   ``I don't think they would have been betting on the success of
this crop in Las Vegas,'' agreed cotton agronomist James Supak of
the Texas Agriculture Extension Service.
   Don Johnson, executive vice president of the Plains Cotton
Growers said this year's yield will be among the strongest of the
past decade.
   A small inventory caused by last year's paltry yield has
strengthened the the market and will drive the value of the
region's cotton crop this year to more than $850 million, experts
said.
   East of San Angelo, Concho Valley cotton farmers in a
three-county area will produce an estimated 145,000 bales valued at
about $47 million, said cotton buyer Brent Ewald of San Angelo.
   ``This is about the biggest crop we've had in 60 to 65 years,''
Ewald said. ``It is a helluva crop, and we're going to see bonus
time around here.''
   About 60 percent of the cotton being harvested in the Concho
Valley already has been purchased, Ewald said.
   But not everyone is celebrating. The June drought conditions did
hurt the harvest in a few areas.
   Ernest Kristinek, a dry land cotton farmer in Hockley County,
outside of Lubbock, said he abandoned 350 of his 1,250 acres
``because they simply did not get enough water to take root.''
   Kristinek said about 35 percent of the county's 290,000 acres of
cotton were abandoned.
   ``Most of the yields are better than everyone thought they were
going to be,'' he said. ``But we just did not get the weather to
help us here. Less than 30 miles away they are whistling Dixie
because they got the rain they needed.''

<BYLINE>Security Pacific Sets Aside $850 Million for Problems
^By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security Pacific Corp. said today it will set
aside $850 million to cover losses on bad loans, foreclosed
commercial real estate and the costs of closing its largely
unprofitable merchant bank.
   The bank holding company, the nation's fifth-largest, said the
measures would cause a loss of $320 million to $360 million during
the fourth quarter, and reduce profit for the year to $160 million
to $200 million. Security Pacific earned $741 million in 1989 and
$639 million in 1988.
   The Los Angeles company's announcement follows a series of
similar actions by big New York banks. It was taken in a gloomy
atmosphere for banks in California, where softness in residential
and commercial real estate has jeopardized what had been a huge
profit center during the '80s boom years.
   Despite the actions, management expects to recommend that
Security Pacific maintain its quarterly dividend of 63 cents per
share, Chief Executive Officer Robert H. Smith said in a statement.
   Smith said Security Pacific's core consumer and commercial
banking operations in California and the Pacific Northwest, and its
nationwide consumer and business finance companies, remain strong.
He said taking the losses and refocussing on core businesses would
``substantially strengthen'' future profitability.
   ``Our objective is to directly focus our strategies and our
resources on the areas where we can achieve solid profit growth,''
Smith said. ``The overall strengths of the corporation permit us to
take these actions at this time.''
   Investors apparently agreed that the moves made sense, bidding
up Security Pacific stock by $1.25 to $23.25 per share in midday
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   During the first three quarters, Security Pacific already had
increased its provisions for loan losses by 60 percent over last
year, to $541 million.
   The company said it would make $600 million in additional
loan-loss reserves during the fourth quarter. It also set aside $50
million to cover the costs of a speeded-up program to sell off
commercial real estate it has been stuck with through foreclosures.
   Security Pacific said it would disband its merchant bank, which
concentrated on lending in the United Kindgom and Australia. The
unit, which also handled commercial and investment banking and
various securities and currency transactions, said it would take a
charge of about $200 million in the fourth quarter to cover the
costs of disbanding.
   ``We expect to sell, downsize, or completely withdraw from many
of our European and Australian activities, due to dramatic and
continuing changes in economic and financial markets,'' Smith said.
   He said profitable wholesale banking units of the merchant bank
would be incorporated into other Security Pacific operations.

   Lawrence Iason, head of the Securities and
Exchange Commission's New York Regional Office - the Wall Street
watchdog agency's largest and busiest - is resigning to return to
private law practice effective March 15.
   Iason, who took over the New York office Jan. 25, 1988, said
today he told SEC Chairman Richard Breeden last week he planned to
leave government service to return to his old law firm.
   ``The time has come. I'm ready to go back to private practice,''
Iason said in a telephone interview from his office in Manhattan.
   He will be a partner at the New York firm of Morvillo,
Abramowitz and Grant. Otto Obermaier, the U.S. attorney in
Manhattan, is a former partner in the firm.
   As regional administrator of the New York office, Iason presided
over several key investigations including the Business Week insider
trading cases stemming from leaks of upcoming market sensitive
stories and an administrative action against the brokerage firm
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. that led to a $5.6
million settlement for alleged misuse of customer accounts.
   Perhaps more significantly, Iason took over an office in
disarray after one regional administrator left suddenly in 1987 and
officials from SEC headquarters in Washington ran the office on an
acting basis.
   One of them, William McLucas, now heads the SEC's Enforcement
Division.
   ``I'm sorry to see him go. I think what he did with that office
is remarkable,'' McLucas said of Iason.
   Iason, 45, is a 1967 Yale graduate who got his law degree in
1971 at New York University.
   He clerked for a federal judge, served in the Watergate special
prosecutor's office and the U.S. attorney's office in New York
before joining his former law firm for the first time in 1979.
   As head of the regional office he oversaw a staff of 250 that
includes, secretaries, investigators and lawyers.
   A native of Hewlett, N.Y., Iason now lives with his wife and
three children in Mamaroneck, N.Y.

<TEXT>
   The Anglo-American health and household products
group SmithKline Beecham PLC on Monday announced it was cutting its
board of directors to 16 members from 20.
   Fewer board members are required following the July 1989 merger
of SmithKline Beckman Corp. of the United States and Britain's
Beecham PLC, said Alan Chandler, a company spokesman.
   The reduction does not signal a change in the company's
strategy, Chandler said.
   SmithKline is cutting the number of directors who hold executive
positions at the company to seven from 10, and reducing the number
of outside directors to nine from 10.
   Resigning from the board are Kenneth Kermes, corporate
development manager; Peter Jackson, corporate personnel director;
and Martyn Greenacre, chairman of the European pharmaceuticals
division. Each remains an executive of the company and a member of
the management committee.
   The resigning outside directors are John Kingman, vice
chancellor of Bristol University; and Handel Evans, executive
chairman of Walsh International Inc., a health care database
information and communications company.
   Alain Gomez, chairman and chief executive officer of French
electronics and defense concern Thomson SA, was named an outside
director of SmithKline Beecham from Jan. 1.

<HEAD>Ford Will Let Dealers Decide How to Spend Incentive Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rather than offering cash incentives on most of
its vehicles, Ford Motor Co. will start giving the money to dealers
and letting them decide how to use it to sell more cars.
   Ford offers cash rebates of $500 to $1,500 on 1990 and 1991
models, or loans with interest rates as low as 4.8 percent, through
a program that expires Tuesday.
   Under the new program, which runs Wednesday through Feb. 28, the
company will continue to offer $500 to $1,000 cash back on a few
models and loans at 7.9 percent interest on some vehicles.
   But for most cars, spokesman David Krupp said, ``X number of
dollars is given to the dealer and he can do with it as he wishes.
He can put some of it into advertising, he can give it back to the
customer, or he can keep part of it for profit. It gives the dealer
more flexibility.''
   Krupp wouldn't predict whether the program would allow Ford to
cut back on costly incentives that all three of the nation's
automakers complain severely dent their profits.
   Robert L. Rewey, vice president for sales operations, said the
company hoped the change would lead to advertising focused more on
products, ``rather than simply selling the deal.''
   ``This new program returns the merchandising responsibility to
our ... dealers,'' he said.

   When 79-year-old Eishiro Saito steps down this week
as chairman of Japan's most powerful business lobby, his successor
will inherit a legendary organization, but one that's losing its
luster.
   The Federation of Economic Organizations, better known as
Keidanren, has gained widespread international recognition for the
huge role it played in bringing Japan to its current heights of
prosperity and economic development.
   However, its influence has waned in recent years because of
aging leadership, business scandals and a decline in the importance
of heavy industry that traditionally has dominated the federation.
   Most observers believe Friday's leadership change may mark the
beginning of a transitional period for the federation, although
they expect no immediate switch in the policies of Japan's economic
giants.
   The 44-year-old Keidanren was first regarded as the voice of
``Japan Inc.'' in the 1950s. As one of four large industrial
federations, Keidanren helped direct business development and
ensured support from the government by controlling business
donations to political parties.
   The federation became the ``overall coordinator and
fund-raiser'' for the Liberal Democratic Party that has governed
for 35 years, journalist Karel Van Wolferen wrote in his book ``The
Enigma of Japanese Power.''
   Keidanren has 938 corporate members, including nearly all the
nation's major companies, and 121 business associations. Steel
makers, ship builders, and power companies traditionally have
dominated the leadership.
   Saito and his successor, Gaishi Hiraiwa, are both from this old
guard. Saito is honorary chairman of Nippon Steel Corp., the
world's largest steel maker, while Hiraiwa is chairman of Tokyo
Electric Co., the world's largest private electric power producer.
   Keidanren still is very close to the governing party. Its
opinions on everything from trade to U.S. relations to foreign aid
carry enough clout to draw most foreign business and political
leaders to the federation's somber building on a side street in the
Otemachi business district.
   But Keidanren has lost some pull in political circles as the
``base of expertise,'' which policy makers depend on for
information, has broadened to include parliamentary committees and
independent research institutes, said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, an
analyst for Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd.
   A symptom of this loss of influence was seen last spring, when
Liberal Democratic Party officials bypassed the federation and
collected political donations from companies directly.
   Japan also has lost the national consensus of the immediate
postwar years when government, industry and most private
individuals believed all Japanese should work together to rebuild.
   ``The business community as a single community is breaking
down,'' said Seichiro Yonekura, an associate professor of business
history at Hitotsubashi University.
   As the main symbol of the tight relations between big business
and government, Keidanren has been tarred by recent business
scandals involving its members, some observers say.
   Keidanren also lost esteem among the public earlier this year
when Saito issued a report opposing proposed land taxes on
corporations designed to reduce Japan's outrageously high real
estate prices, a problem that many people have blamed on corporate
greed.
   ``The image of Saito (came) down'' as a result, Yonekura said.
   But his image already was hurting. During Saito's first two-year
term, which began in 1986, he had been considered a lucky optimist
exemplified by his philosophy: ``Seek for brightness and do not
look at darkness.'' In photographs, he resembled a balding,
bespectacled leprechaun.
   But several articles in the local press in the last two years
criticized him for weakness and lacking a philosophy.
   Hiraiwa, 76, has a reputation for relatively progressive
thinking, although he has not yet articulated a philosophy for
Keidanren. A seemingly cheerful man, he also is known as
self-effacing and patient, in part due to his 13-year service as a
federation vice chairman.
   Compared to Saito, the new chairman is seen as someone ``more in
tune with popular opinion,'' said Gregory Clark, a professor at
Sophia University who studies Japan's economy.
   Shijuro Ogata, deputy governor of the Japan Development Bank,
believes Hiraiwa may be ``in the long run, the beginning of a
transition'' to younger leadership.
   The next leader probably will come from among the federation's
12 vice chairmen, who are scheduled for a reshuffling next month
after selection rules were changed to bring in men younger than 70.
The new officers reportedly will represent industries such as
services and distribution.

   Prices moved narrowly higher on Wall Street
today, drifting uncertainly after the stock market's pullback late
last week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 20.30 points
Thursday and Friday, edged up 2.97 to 2,593.07 by 2 p.m. EST.
   Advancers were slightly ahead of gainers in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 764 up, 702 down and
523 unchanged.
   The market climbed to 2{-month highs last Wednesday amid rising
hopes for an orderly resolution of the showdown in the Middle East.
   But then prices began to retreat as traders seemed to conclude
that the mood of optimism, and the rally, might have gone to
unwarranted extremes.
   That wariness was reinforced today by word from an Iraqi
official that his country was not ready to compromise ``one iota''
on its position in Kuwait.
   Brokers also noted that investors were still digesting Friday's
monthly report on the employment situation, which painted a gloomy
picture of the outlook for growth and corporate profits.
   The Labor Department said the civilian unemployment rate jumped
0.2 percentage point to 5.9 percent in November, and that nonfarm
payroll employment took a bigger-than-expected drop of 267,000.
   Among blue chip issues, Philip Morris rose | to 50|, Boeing was

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common rose .32 to
179.39. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was
down .04 at 306.41.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 96.35 million shares with two
hours of trading left.

   They are competitors turned
confidantes: two corporate giants, one American, one Japanese, who
have joined hands here. Call it a marriage of convenience. Or call
it the future of steel.
   Either way, it's accurate. Inland Steel Co. and Nippon Steel
Corp. have formed a $1 billion partnership in these corn fields,
building a 10-story, 21st century mill that symbolizes the changing
look of the industry.
   Big steel in the '90s means big partnerships. The United States
and Japan, old rivals, have become new allies, each looking to
profit as they breathe life into an industry flat on its back for
much of the last decade.
   ``The Japanese are helping rebuild our steel industry and we
should not be upset by that,'' said Richard Florida, a management
and public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University. ``The
Japanese get access to the American markets. Americans get the
technology and good jobs. It's a win-win-win situation.''
   It's a marriage for money, not love.
   The Japanese have poured about $7 billion into single or joint
steel ventures, almost all in the late '80s, Florida said.
Kawasaki, Sumitomo, Kobe and Nippon - the world's largest
steelmaker - are putting down roots on the industrial landscape,
welcomed by such American stalwarts as Armco, LTV, USX and Inland.
   Inland-Nippon's I-N Tek, the world's most modern cold-rolling
steel mill, and I-N Kote, a galvanizing facility that coats steel,
together have a $1 billion price tag.
   The partnerships seem an odd twist, considering that imports -
along with the strong dollar and recession - contributed to
America's steel decline in the 1980s. Japan was the No. 1 foreign
supplier through the decade. American companies bitterly complained
about Japanese dumping.
   ``There's a big irony to it,'' said John Jacobson, of AUS
Consultants in suburban Philadelphia. ``Many of the U.S. companies
have just had to grin and bear it. They've really had to change
their perception of the world.''
   ``Have we given up control? Certainly,'' he said. ``U.S.
management does not control its destiny like it used to. But its
destiny wasn't all that good. Their prospects have improved with
their investment. It's better to have half of something good than
all of something bad.''
   Steel, indeed, was in crisis in the early to mid-'80s. Mills
closed, towns died, the work force shrank by hundreds of thousands.
The industry lost $12 billion from 1982 to 1986, though it since
has rebounded.
   ``It was a fat, overweight industry that ran into a wall and
ended up in the hospital for a few years,'' Jacobson said. ``Now it
seems to be back on a better diet, slimmed down, a little more
competitive.''
   The Japanese interest is largely spurred by the desire to sell
steel to the growing number of Japanese auto companies in this
country. I-N Tek, for example, sells to four: Honda, Toyota,
Chrysler-Mitsubishi, Suburu-Isuzu.
   These partnerships are just part of a nationwide Japanese
investment explosion. Some 1,100 manufacturing plants with a
Japanese majority interest were established or under construction
in the United States by the end of 1988, the Japan Economic
Institute reported last year.
   Japanese companies have invested more than $25 billion in
rubber, autos, auto suppliers and steel, Florida said.
   That way, the Japanese avoid the expense of building new mills
alone and reduce political risks ``by `buying off' U.S. producers
who receive both up-front cash and a share of ongoing profits,''
said a study co-written by Florida this year.
   These investments, Florida notes, also provide a solution to
trade barriers that limit the amount of steel that can be imported;
the current level is 19.5 percent of the U.S. market.
   Still, some bemoan the trend.
   The Japanese ``look far out into the future,'' said Tom Jones, a
staff representative for the United Steelworkers of America. ``My
concern is American management is so devoted to ... immediate
returns to stockholders or the short-term bottom line that unless
we're very careful, the Japanese will simply one day wake up and
have them all for breakfast.''
   Inland needed help after a disastrous string of years, starting
with 1982's loss of $119 million, the first full-year loss since
the Depression. Three more bad years followed, with losses totaling
$336 million.
   By the mid-'80s, about 30 percent of Inland's facilities were
obsolete and the steelmaker was hearing it couldn't match the
quality of imports, said Frank Luerssen, chairman and chief
executive of Inland Steel Industries Inc., the parent company.
   Times were so terrible that Inland sold its Chicago
headquarters.
   But there was hope. Nippon's chairman already had expressed
interest in a joint project, and as a potential mate, the Japanese
company had an attractive dowry: lots of money and sophisticated
technology.
   After Luerssen saw Nippon's continuous cold-rolling mill turn
out steel coils faster and smoother than ever during a Japan visit
in 1984, he decided Inland needed one to be competitive.
   Initially, the steelmaker planned to buy the technology and
equipment and own the mill. But it was clear it couldn't do that
financially.
   Workers knew it, too.
   ``We saw the business go away. We saw the number of employees
continue to shrink,'' said Paul Rausch, president of Local 9231 at
I-N Tek, who formerly worked at Inland's steel-making plant,
Indiana Harbor Works. The labor force at Indiana Harbor dropped
from 24,500 to 14,500 during the last decade.
   In 1987, after protracted negotiations, the Inland-Nippon
partnership was announced. Inland has 60 percent of the
partnership, Nippon 40 percent. Japanese lenders provided the bulk
of the money to build the plant, which started production this
spring.
   I-N Tek, the nation's only continuous cold-rolling mill, uses a
process that slashes production time from 12 days to less than an
hour with a third of the workers.
   ``This is the 21st century mill. We just built it early,'' said
George Landsly, manager of administration.
   It is a high-tech marvel: computer rooms resemble air traffic
control towers, human hands rarely touch steel, backbreaking chores
are performed by machines that look like props from ``The
Terminator.''
   And the product is premium-quality steel, made from coils an &lsqb;
of a inch thick and 65 inches wide that are cleaned, compressed,
softened, flattened and finished, then inspected to meet orders for
cars, appliances and office furniture.
   ``You get a uniform product over and over again,'' Landsly said.
``It's almost like making cookies one at a time or making a batch
together, where they all taste the same.''

   Nippon's ``technical competency is about equivalent to the total
technical effort in the U.S. steel industry,'' Luerssen said.
``It's a substantial leverage for us to have a close association.''
   The companies also are 50-50 partners in I-N Kote, two
galvanizing lines that coat steel to prevent corrosion. It will be
completed in 1991. Both ventures will employ about 450 workers,
operating with Japanese work methods and team concepts.
   The partnership has not been without cultural tensions: angry
calls when Japan's flag was raised at the Harbor Works during a
visit by Nippon executives and fears by some Inland workers, Rausch
said, that ``our Japanese partner would come in here and it would
resemble an old World War II movie.''
   Instead, he said, they've been a good model.
   ``We might traditionally nip at each other's heels being union
and management,'' Rausch said. ``The Japanese think things through
and look at it form all different angles and they brainstorm on how
to resolve an issue. That tends to rub off.
   ``I feel very lucky to be here,'' he said. ``It's new
technology. It should give me a stable income. When I come to work,
I have something to give. You can't put a price on that feeling.''

   Here are some U.S.-Japanese steel ventures:
   -Kawasaki Steel Corp. and Armco Inc. last year formed Armco
Steel Co. It is expected to be a 50-50 partnership in 1991. It
involves two steel plants - one in Ohio, the other in Kentucky.
   -LTV Steel and Sumitomo Metal Industries' first joint venture is
called L-S Electro-Galvanizing Co. It operates a plant in
Cleveland. LTV has a 60 percent share. A second, 50-50,
partnership, L-S II Electro-Galvanizing Co., has been formed and a
plant in Columbus, Ohio, is under construction. It will begin
operating in 1991.
   -Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. and Nisshin Steel Co. Ltd.
formed a joint venture in 1986 called Wheeling-Nisshin Inc. Nisshin
has a two-thirds share in the partnership. The company's plant is
in West Virginia.
   -A joint venture was formed in 1984 between NKK Corp. and
National Intergroup Inc., the parent company of National Steel. NKK
has a 70 percent share in the company, National Steel Corp. It
operates three mills, in Michigan, Illinois and Indiana.
   -Nucor Corp. owns 51 percent and Yamato Kogyo the remainder in a
company called Nucor-Yamato. Its mill is in Arkansas and is managed
by Nucor.
   -A joint venture between USS and Kobe Steel Inc. was formed in
1987. The 50-50 partnership involves a plant in Ohio.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid hopes the United
States will grant food assistance to the Soviet Union.
   The markets traded within narrow margins on light volume all day
as traders awaited news from Houston, where Secretary of State
James Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze opened
two days of talks that were to include a discussion of export
credit guarantees.
   Gerald Zusel, a vice president of E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc., said traders generally believe the Bush
administration will offer the Soviets credits to buy food but ``the
question is how much and what will they buy with those credits?''
   He said the Soviets are believed to be seeking $3 billion in
export credits and the United States is expected to provide no more
than half that amount.
   Zusel said the grain markets ``are just kind of waiting around
to see what it's going to be.''
   At the close, wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.53\ a bushel; corn was
1 cent to 2\ cents higher with December at $2.27 a bushel; oats
were { cent lower to { cent higher with December at $1.10{ a

down and 502 unchanged.
   The market climbed to 2{-month highs last Wednesday amid rising
hopes for an orderly resolution of the showdown in the Middle East.
   But then prices began to retreat as traders seemed to conclude
that the mood of optimism, and the rally, might have gone to
unwarranted extremes.
   That wariness was reinforced today by word from an Iraqi
official that his country was not ready to compromise ``one iota''
on its position in Kuwait.
   Brokers also noted that investors were still digesting Friday's
monthly report on the employment situation, which painted a gloomy
picture of the outlook for growth and corporate profits.
   The Labor Department said the civilian unemployment rate jumped
0.2 percentage point to 5.9 percent in November, and that nonfarm
payroll employment took a bigger-than-expected drop of 267,000.
   Among blue chip issues, Philip Morris rose { to 50{, Boeing was

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common rose .18 to

down .13 at 306.32.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 112.80 million shares with an

<HEAD>United, Amtrak Offer Tickets that Mix Air, Rail Travel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you've always wanted to ride a train across
the country, but didn't have the time to take it all the way back,
United Airlines and Amtrak said Monday they've got just the deal
you've been waiting for.
   They unveiled a train-plane ticketing agreement that will offer
passengers a cheaper fare when they fly one way and ride the rails
the other way.
   The setup would also allow travelers to fly into certain major
gateway cities, then take trains around the region before returning
to the gateway city to fly home.
   ``Long-distance train trips have enormous appeal among
prospective Amtrak passengers, but many people lack the vacation
time for a cross-country train trip both ways,'' said Timothy P.
Gardner, Amtrak's vice president of passenger marketing. ``The
Amtrak Air-Rail travel plan will enable travelers to take an
extended train trip and then fly home.''
   In the past, people who rode the train one way and flew a plane
the other way got stuck paying full one-way fares, but United and
Amtrak said their rates on the new tickets will be roughly
equivalent to a round-trip air fare.
   Amtrak intitiated the deal by approaching United about three
years ago, after determining that United's ``route system is a
better match with our route system than the other airlines,''
Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin said.
   At least one airline analyst doubted that the train-plane
arrangement will amount to much more than a marketing gimmick.
   ``I don't think there's a big market for it,'' said Raymond E.
Neidl of Dillon Read &amp; Co. Inc. ``It might generate some marginal
revenues. I don't think it's going to be that significant.''
   Neidl said that Amtrak service is not widely available outside
the Northeast, which limits the value of the package.
   Amtrak's spokeswoman disagreed, saying that although cities
don't have very many departure and arrival times on the national
railroad, a speedy arrival is not the goal of most train travelers.
   ``That's very true in the west, where we only have one train a
day in each direction,'' Martin said. ``People don't take the train
just to get someplace. They take the train for the experience of
riding the train. People travel from Denver to Salt Lake City for
the experience of traveling through the Rockies at ground level.
It's an experience you don't get from the air.''
   A Washington-based group that promotes rail travel as
environmentally sound was pleased to see the deal come together,
although a spokesman was not familiar enough with travel marketing
to predict how successful it might be.
   ``I think anything that encourages people to take the train on
any part of their journey is desirable,'' said Scott Leonard,
assistant director of the National Association of Railroad
Passengers. Leonard said rail transporation is particularly
important these days, because it is energy-efficient and could cut
the nation's demand for foreign crude oil.
   Gardner predicted Amtrak will attract thousands of passengers
through the deal. A United spokeswoman, Sara Dornacker, said the
airline would not reveal how much extra business it hopes to pick
up.
   ``United's estimate of passenger volumes through this program
are significant,'' she said.
   To illustrate the savings that passengers could achieve through
the deal, Dornacker said the best current one-way air fare from New
York to Los Angeles, combined with a one-way rail fare, would cost
$664. The train-plane ticket would go for $419, for a savings of 37
percent, she said, adding that savings would be similar on other
excursions.
   Amtrak had previously teamed up with another airline, Midway, to
let passengers fly into Philadelphia then use their same ticket to
take a train to Atlantic City. The deal lasted from this past
spring until fall, when Midway got out of its Philadelphia hub.

<HEAD>Germany's Largest Auto Producer Planning Massive Investment In
Skoda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Volkswagen plans to invest up to $6.3
billion in the Czechoslovak car company Skoda, Volkswagen said
Monday after winning a bid to take over the company.
   Franstisek Vlasak, deputy premier of the Czech republic, told a
news conference in Prague that cooperation between the two car
companies will begin in January.
   A joint stock venture will be formed, with Volkswagen pumping in
some $300 million at the start, Vlasak said.
   Ortwin Witzel, a Volkswagen spokesman, said Skoda's 21,000
employees were assured of no layoffs in the deal, which is to begin
with a 35 percent investment in Skoda next year that will reach 70
percent by 1995.
   On Sunday, Czechoslovakia announced that Volkswagen had outbid
Renault of France and Sweden's Volvo for Skoda.
   The company is considered one of the best auto manufacturers in
Eastern Europe. It has a long manufacturing tradition, using its
own designs, and its cars have a reputation for reliability.
   Volkswagen said Skoda will become another of VW's subsidiaries,
joining Audi and Volkswagen in Germany and SEAT in Spain.
   In the first stage beginning next year, Volkswagen said the
venture will produce 200,000 Favorit-model Skodas. By 1997, that
number is to increase to 400,000 cars a year.
   Skoda currently produces about 250,000 cars a year.
   Volkswagen said it foresees a market of up to 3 million vehicles
in the central European region by the year 2000.
   Volkswagen said it will modernize Skoda's main manufacturing
facility in Mlada Boleslav and eventually build a new engine
factory and assembly plant.
   Volkswagen said the motor plant is to be completed by 1995 and
produce about 500,000 engines for the Czechoslovak auto industry as
well as for other Volkswagen units.
   An international distribution network will also be developed to
sell Skoda cars outside Europe, the company said.
   A contract must still be signed between the two companies and a
new leadership named.
   Miroslav Gregr, Czech minister of engineering, said Monday in
Prague that it may be possible to sign the basic provisions of the
contract by the end of the year.

<HEAD>Northwest Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines Announce Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines will invest in the
struggling Hawaiian Airlines in exchange for some of the
Honolulu-based carrier's lucrative South Pacific routes, the air
carriers announced Monday.
   Northwest would own 25 percent of Hawaiian Airlines after paying
the airline and its parent, HAL Inc., $20 million, including $7
million as a secured loan, a statement said.
   John Dasburg, president and chief executive officer of the
Eagan-based Northwest, said the deal will expand Northwest's
international strength and strengthen its presence in Hawaii.
   Under the deal, Northwest would receive Hawaiian's Australian
routes. Northwest dominates U.S. traffic across the North Pacific
and reaches such South Pacific cities as Manila from Japan. But
Northwest has lacked and longed for a chance to close the loop over
the Pacific with southern routes to Australia.
   Hawaiian also will transfer to Northwest its operating authority
to fly between four Asian cities. In addition, Northwest will lease
two widebody aircraft, to be operated by Northwest pilots, to
Hawaiian so it can operate seven flights a week on the
Honolulu-Fukuoka, Japan, route.
   Tom Talbot, chairman of HAL, said the airlines also will
cooperate in marketing and operation areas, producing new revenue,
saving money and increasing efficiency.
   Hawaiian Airlines, Hawaii's largest airline, serves 22
international and domestic destinations in the Pacific. It operates
more than 200 daily flights between the major Hawaiian islands.
   Separately, Northwest announced it was lowering fares between
U.S. cities and seven Canadian destinations. The discounted fares
are available for travel between Jan. 11 and Feb. 19, as long as
tickets are bought before Jan. 16.
   The lower fares are for travel to and from Montreal, Toronto,
Winnipeg, Edmonton, Quebec City, Vancouver and Victoria.

<HEAD>Dollar Up in NY After Falling Abroad, Gold Moves Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar advanced in New York after falling
overseas Monday as the Federal Reserve took no apparent steps to
push interest rates lower.
   Gold prices moved higher.
   Foreign exchange traders went into Monday's session fearing that
the Fed - which relaxed its monetary policy on Friday - would again
nudge rates downward.
   Mike Faust, a foreign exchange analyst with MMS International in
Chicago, said the market worried that the nation's central bank
would lower the discount rate or take some other aggressive action.
   However, ``it never materialized,'' Faust said. ``The dollar got
a temporary reprieve.''
   On Friday, the Fed announced it was injecting $1.5 billion into
the banking system, a move designed to encourage banks to make
funds more available and to allow interest rates to fall. The Fed
acted after the Labor Department issued an employment report that
showed the economy continued to weaken in November.
   The dollar, which is supported by higher interest rates, fell
sharply after the Fed's move. When no further steps were taken
Monday, the U.S. currency moved higher.
   Faust said that despite the dollar's rise, the outlook for the
U.S. currency remained negative. If the economy continues to
weaken, the Fed may be forced to relax its policy further.
   The dollar gained ground against the Japanese yen in New York,
closing at 132.15 yen, up from 130.70 yen late Friday. In Tokyo,
the dollar fell to a closing 130.55 Japanese yen from 132.17 yen at
Friday's close, and in London, it was quoted at 130.55 yen.
   The British pound was also brought lower by interest rate
concerns. The market expects the new Major government in Britain to
lower rates.
   Sterling fell to $1.9442 in New York from $1.9535 late Friday,
and in London, the pound fell to $1.9450 from $1.9510 dollars late
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.4725 German marks, up from 1.4720; 1.2615 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2532; 5.0050 French francs, up from 4.9975;
1,112.25 Italian lire, up from 1,110.00; and 1.15715 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.15805.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday,
included:1.4708 German marks, down from 1.4775; 1.2610 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2615; 4.9980 French francs, down from 5.0161;
1.6585 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6675; 1,109.75 Italian lire,
down from 1,113.75; and 1.1566 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1590.
   Gold rose in New York, closing at $374.20 a troy ounce, up $3.90
on the Commodity Exchange. Republic National Bank later quoted a
bid of $373.00, up $3.70.
   In London earlier, gold rose to a late bid price of $373.75 a
troy ounce, up from $371.00 late Friday. In Zurich, the metal rose
to a closing bid of $373.75, up from $371.50 late Friday.
   In Hong Kong early Monday, gold rose 62 cents to close at a bid
$372.45.
   Silver fell on the Commodity Exchange in New York to $4.050 a
troy ounce, down 0.5 cent. The metal also fell in London to a late
bid price of $4.05 a troy ounce, down from $4.14 late Friday.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Rise Modestly As Iraq Vows to Keep Kuwait</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices showed modest gains on the futures
market Monday, after settling back from an early rally sparked by
news that Iraq had no plans to leave Kuwait.
   Meanwhile, a winter storm in Europe and refinery problems in
Saudi Arabia helped push up the futures prices of home heating oil
and unleaded gasoline.
   The market lacked the strength to show much of a run-up,
however, following big losses over the past week and a half that
have knocked oil prices down to levels not seen since August, the
month Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   ``People are not that dreadfully bullish,'' said Peter Beutel,
an oil analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc.
   Light sweet crude oil opened 82 cents per barrel higher at the
New York Mercantile Exchange, shortly after Iraq said it would
``not compromise one iota'' on its claims to oil-rich Kuwait. Crude
later settled well off its highs, at $26.90 per barrel, up 32
cents, on contracts for delivery in January.
   Later contract months for crude delivery showed similar modest
gains.
   Oil traders said prices were propped up by U.S. and Iraqi debate
over the pending dates of diplomatic meetings intended to bring the
Persian Gulf crisis to an end. News that those sessions would be
held had sent oil prices crashing in recent sessions, but the
difficulties in arranging the meetings was having a bullish effect.
   Home heating oil futures showed the biggest move on the energy
market, rising 1.80 cents to 80.97 cents a gallon on January
delivery contracts, although the swing was not particularly large
compared with moves in other recent sessions.
   Prices were bolstered by the arrival of the first winter storm
in Europe and an increase in Japanese demand for heating oil,
analysts said.
   Heating oil prices closed higher for delivery through the later
winter and spring months, but contracts for delivery after that
fell slightly for the day.
   Unleaded gasoline prices all closed modestly higher. Contracts
for delivery in January were up 1.26 cents at 67.73 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said the petroleum products were given an early lift on
news that a Saudi Arabian refinery had been closed after a small
fire, but the extent of the production problems was not immediately
clear and the market reaction was mild.
   Natural gas, which is not directly affected by fears of war in
the Middle East, was mixed on Monday. The January delivery contract
was up .5 cent at $2.355 per 1,000 cubic feet.

   The stock market recorded a small gain in
slackened trading Monday, struggling to rebound from its pullback
late last week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 20.30 points
Thursday and Friday, recovered 6.68 to 2,596.78.
   Advancing issues just barely outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 798 up, 774

   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 138.65 million

Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the

   The market climbed to 2{-month highs last Wednesday amid rising
hopes for an orderly resolution of the showdown in the Middle East.
   But then prices began to retreat as traders seemed to conclude

   That wariness was reinforced Monday by word from an Iraqi

<HEAD>Privatization of Telephone Company Raises Hopes for Better Service</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sale of the government-owned telephone
monopoly to a consortium including French and American buyers
raised the prospect Monday that it will get easier for Mexicans to
get a phone and that when they do, it will work better.
   The Treasury Department on Sunday announced that St. Louis-based
Southwestern Bell, France Cable &amp; Radio and the Mexican Grupo Carso
had submitted the winning bid of $1.76 billion for a controlling
interest in Telefonos de Mexico.
   The sale means ``it will be possible to improve service notably,
continue expanding the system, strengthen research and
technological development...'' the government newspaper El Nacional
said in an editorial.
   The sale was part of the government's program of selling an
array of unprofitable or non-essential businesses and industries to
the private sector.
   ``One of the purposes for the sale of Telefonos de Mexico was
related to improvement of service,'' an editorial in El Universal
said.
   ``There is a long road to travel, but there is no uncertainty
about the new possibilities of making the advances that should
occur in telephone modernization,'' it added.
   Alfredo Baranda, Telmex director, said the improvements would
take time.
   The new owners hope that the wait for telephone service can be
cut to two or three months within the next three or four years, he
told the government news agency Notimex.
   There are now only 5.5 million telephone lines in Mexico serving
a population of 81 million people. France Cable &amp; Radio, in
contrast, operates 28 million telephone lines in France.
   Shortages of lines, installation costs, line troubles and repair
delays plague the Telmex system.
   Desperate customers occasionally publish newspaper ads or write
letters the editor in last-ditch attempts to get repairs for lines
that have been out for months.
   Although customers may be rejoicing at the prospect of better
telephone service, some Telmex employees are unhappy at the
privatization.
   The sale agreement also provides government financing of the
sale of 4.4 percent of the stock to company employees over eight
years. A dissident union leader said the privatization was carried
out ``without consulting the workers.''
   More than 500 employees have been fired over the past two years
and the situation of 3,000 operators remains unresolved, Rigoberto
Barba said.
   The government's privatization program is part of a revamping of
the economy to cut the government debt and attract more foreign
investment.
   Acciones y Valores de Mexico, GTE of the United States and
Telefonica de Espana had offered $1.69 billion. Mexico's Grupo
Gentor offered nearly $1.6 billion.
   The sale will return Telmex to the private sector. Formed in
1950 by the merger of companies owned by International Telephone
and Telegraph of the United States and I.M. Ericsson of Sweden,
majority ownership was sold to Mexicans in 1958. The government
took over 51 percent ownership in 1972.

<TEXT>
   Security Pacific Corp. said Monday it would
set aside $850 million for bad loans, foreclosed real estate and
restructuring costs, a move that will result in a fourth-quarter
loss of up to $360 million.
   The Los Angeles concern, the nation's fifth-largest bank holding
company, said its profit for the 1990 fiscal year will decline to
about $160 million, compared with $741 million in 1989.
   Security Pacific also said it will eliminate its merchant bank,
which ran into trouble with lending in Britain and Australia.
   The company maintained that its core consumer and commercial
banking operations in California and the Pacific Northwest remain
strong. Taking losses now and focussing on core business will
``substantially strengthen'' future profits, said Chief Executive
Robert Smith.
   The big debt-rating services, Moody's Investors Service Inc. and
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., immediately began reviewing the company's
debt ratings. S&amp;P said major areas of concern were overseas
operations and deteriorating domestic loans, while Moody's said its
review would focus on commercial real estate lending and takeover
loans.
   Security Pacific's announcement follows similar actions by big
New York banks, in the face of loan defaults, a slowing economy and
declining real estate values.
   California banks also face weakening residential and commercial
real estate markets, as well as tougher government demands on
lenders that have affected banks and thrifts nationwide.
   Management will recommend that Security Pacific maintain its
quarterly dividend of 63 cents per share, Smith said.
   Security Pacific stock, which had fallen by $3 on Friday, rose
$1 to $23 per share Monday on the New York Stock Exchange as
investors apparently accepted Smith's take-your-medicine-now
explanation.
   Less sanguine was Prudential Bache Securities analyst George
Salem, who said he could not understand why the stock rose on the
bad news.
   Compared to other California banks, Security Pacific's potential
problems with real estate loans are high, Salem said in a telephone
interview from New York.
   ``Their exposure is most heavily oriented to Southern
California, which is the weaker part of the California economy,''
Salem said.
   Salem recommended that investors dump Security Pacific and other
California bank stocks in a recent report that said California home
resale prices could fall by 25 percent by 1992, new home sales are
extremely weak, and commercial real estate is mired in rising
vacancies, falling rents, a credit crunch and shrinking appraisals.
   ``The economic trends for California remain poor,'' Salem said
Monday, noting that last week's unemployment figures showed the
jobless rate for the state rose from 6 percent to 6.7 percnnt.
   Security Pacific, in the first three quarters, had increased its
provisions for loan losses by 60 percent over last year, to $541
million.
   It said it would take $600 million in additional loan-loss
reserves during the fourth quarter. It also set aside $50 million
to cover a speeded-up program to sell off commercial real estate it
has been stuck with through foreclosures.
   Security Pacific's merchant bank had handled commercial and
investment banking and various securities and currency transactions
in more than 20 countries. The company said it would take a charge
of about $200 million in the fourth quarter to cover the costs of
phasing out that bank.
   ``We expect to sell, downsize, or completely withdraw from many
of our European and Australian activities, due to dramatic and
continuing changes in economic and financial markets,'' Smith said.

<HEAD>Former Shearson Executive Becomes Smith Barney Vice Chairman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jeffrey B. Lane, removed as the president of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. during a management shuffle last year,
has been named a vice chairman at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.,
it was announced Monday.
   Lane, 48, currently an executive at Smith Barney's parent,
Primerica Corp., will oversee the investment firm's asset
management group and its futures division, Smith Barney said in a
statement.
   Smith Barney said Lane would continue in his position at
Primerica, where he is in charge of the recently formed Smith
Barney Trust Co.
   In November 1989, Lane was removed as president and chief
operating officer of Shearson and was reassigned to head the
strugling investment firm's asset management business. He resigned
a month later and joined Primerica early this year.
   Shearson, a subsidiary of American Express Co., underwent a
shakeup and a $900 recapitalization last year after suffering a
prolonged earnings decline. Turmoil at the company continued into
1990 with the resignation of Chairman Peter Cohen.
   Shearson has since renamed itself Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Lane joined a Shearson predecessor, Cogan, Berlind, Weil &amp;
Levitt, in 1969 as a securities analyst and rose steadily through
the ranks until last year.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Rebound from 3-Day Slide on Mideast Jitters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices rallied Monday on New York's Commodity
Exchange, erasing almost half of last week's steep losses in
reaction to tough talk from both sides in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   On other commodity markets, silver futures edged lower; oil
futures rose; livestock and meat futures advanced; and grains and
soybeans were mostly higher.
   Gold futures settled $3.50 to $3.90 higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $374.20 a troy ounce; silver finished 0.5
cent to 0.9 cent lower with December at $4.05 a troy ounce.
   Gold's rally marked a turnaround for the market, which fell a
total of $8.60 in the three previous sessions.
   Perceptions about the possibility of war in the Middle East
dominated gold trading, said precious metals analyst Don Tierney of
Fortune Commodities Inc. in New York.
   He said prices opened higher in New York following a rally on
the London market after the Cable News Network aired an interview
with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz saying Baghdad does not
recognize the United Nations' Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to withdraw
from Kuwait.
   The Iraqi government also issued a statement saying it would
``not compromise one iota'' in its claim to the emirate it seized
more than four months ago.
   President Bush, in a speech in Washington, denounced the Iraqi
takeover of Kuwait as a ``systematic assault on the soul of a
nation.''
   Higher energy prices and a weaker dollar also supported gold,
Tierney said.
   ``At one point we were up $6.50, then some profit-taking came
in,'' he said.
   In energy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light
sweet crude oil settled 26 cents to 35 cents higher with January at
$26.90 a barrel; heating oil finished .24 cent lower to 1.8 cents
higher with January at 80.97 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.99 cent to 1.7 cents higher with January at 67.73 cents a gallon;
natural gas ended 0.5 cent lower to 4.5 cents higher with January
at $2.355 per thousand cubic feet.
   Frozen pork belly futures soared the permitted daily limit of 2
cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as low cash belly
prices and tight stocks of frozen bellies encouraged buying in the
commercial sector.
   Charles K. Levitt, senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc., estimated Dec. 1 frozen belly stocks at less than 23
million pounds compared with 67.5 million pounds a year ago. The
Agriculture Department will release its estimate of Dec. 1 stocks
on Dec. 21.
   Levitt said the market also was due for a rebound after dropping
almost 12 cents from mid-November to early December.
   Hog prices rallied in sympathy with the bellies while cattle
futures advanced to new record highs in line with record-high cash
prices of up to 81.5 cents a pound, he said.
   Live cattle futures settled .35 cent to .78 cent higher with
December at 80.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent to .50
cent higher with January at 89 cents a pound; live hogs were .25
cent to .70 cent higher with December at 49.95 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with
February at 66.70 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices finished mostly higher after a
day of light trading on the Chicago Board of Trade amid hopes the
United States will grant food assistance to the Soviet Union.
   The markets traded within narrow margins as traders awaited news
from Houston, where Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze opened two days of talks that
were to include a discussion of export credit guarantees.
   Wheat futures settled \ cent to 1\ cents higher with December at
$2.53\ a bushel; corn was } cent to 2{ cents higher with December
at $2.26} a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to { cent higher with
December at $1.10\ a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 3 cents higher

   Delta Air Lines on Monday asked to withdraw its
proposal for a nonstop flight from Atlanta to Moscow, and filed
instead for a route with one stop in Germany.
   The Atlanta-based airline previously had asked the Department of
Transportation for permission to operate three weekly nonstop
flights between Atlanta and Moscow-Leningrad in 1991, with daily
flights beginning in 1992.
   Whit Hawkins, Delta's executive vice president for marketing and
stations, cited increased uel costs and economic conditions in the
United States and the Soviet Union as reasons for the decision not
to pursue nonstop service.
   Delta, Hawkins said, is ``keenly interested'' in the one-stop
route, however.
   Delta is the third U.S. airline to withdraw its application for
nonstop service. Continental Airlines and United Airlines are the
others.

<HEAD>Lone Star Industries Seeks Bankruptcy Protection From Creditors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lone Star Industries Inc., a large cement
company, filed Monday for reorganization under federal bankruptcy
law.
   The corporation blamed its financial woes on the downturn in the
construction industry and continued competition with subsidized
imports.
   Lone Star's board considred two offers from foreign investors
and other alternatives before concluding it would be best to seek
bankruptcy protection, the company said.
   More than two-thirds of the cement industry in the United States
has passed into the hands of foreign investors, the company noted.
   In its filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y.,
the corporation listed assets of $1.066 billion and liabilities of
$703 million as of Oct. 31, said company spokesman James A. Powers.
   Lone Star and a number of its subsidiaries filed for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. Lone
Star said the filing would enable it to continue a program begun in
1989 to sell off some assets and restructure the company around its
core business operations of cement, aggregate and ready-mixed
concrete.
   The company took a $250 million writeoff in November 1989 as
part of its restructuring, which included a decision to sell
marginal cement plants in Pryor, Okla., Sweetwater, Texas, and
Bonner Springs, Kan. The plants are still up for sale.
   The remaining operations are located in the Northeast and
Midwest.
   Lone Star said its profits have been hurt by foreign concerns
selling cement in the United States at less than they charge at
home, a practice known as dumping.
   The federal government recently found Mexican producers guilty
of dumping.
   ``Unfortunately, this ruling is several years too late,'' Lone
Star said. ``However, should other dumpers suffer the same fate,
our business could improve its profitability.''
   Even after restructuring, Lone Star and its affiliates retain a
9.8 million ton annual cement manufacturing capacity in the United
States, the company said.
   For the nine-month period ending Sept. 30, Lone Star reported a
net loss of $12.2 million, or 97 cents a share. Net sales for the
period were $190.6 million, and exclude the operations held for
sale.

   In an effort to cut costs, Wang
Laboratories Inc. will shut down much of its North American
operations during the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, a
company spokeswoman said Monday.
   Under the move, Wang employees in the United States and Canada
will take vacations from Dec. 24 through Jan. 1, although
``skeleton crews'' will still staff the company's facilities,
spokeswoman Gail Jackson said.
   This is the first time the company has taken such a move, she
said.
   Jackson said Wang chose to take this step during a slow time of
the year. It will make more employees available during higher peaks
of demand.
   Wang, a Lowell-based computer maker, recently reported its first
profitable quarter after a string of losses. But Jackson said the
company is still looking for ways to cut expenses.
   While employees will take vacations from accumulated time-off
with pay, the company will save money by scaling back its
operations, Jackson said.
   Jackson could not estimate how much money Wang will save from
the shutdown.

   Cereal that cures flab, cigarettes that keep
you slim and an airline fleet as new as its last overhaul are among
the most deceptive advertising claims of the past year, consumer
groups contended Monday.
   General Motors' depiction of itself as a safety pioneer and
Philip Morris' new image as a champion of the Bill of Rights also
won ``Harlan Page Hubbard Lemon Awards'' from assorted consumer,
health and environmental groups.
   The annual awards are named for ``the first advertising
executive to employ deceptive advertising techniques on a national
scale,'' according to the Center for Science in the Public
Interest.
   Hubbard is best known for his efforts on behalf of Lydia
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, a turn-of-the-century quack patent
medicine touted as a cure for complaints ranging from fatigue to
cancer.
   ``The Hubbard spirit is alive and well in the advertising
community,'' said Bruce Silverglade, legal director of the center.
   Silverglade and others called on Congress to strengthen the
Federal Trade Commission's power to regulate advertising.
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., a consumer advocate when he
served as Connecticut's attorney general, said consumer groups and
state attorneys general need FTC help in their efforts to get
deceptive ads off the air.
   ``As good as all those people are, they simply do not have the
power to cleanse the marketplace of bad advertising,'' Lieberman
said.
   The Hubbards have been awarded for the past six years to ad
campaigns branded ``the most misleading, unfair or irresponsible''
by groups familiar with their products.
   The 1990 entry into the ``Hubbard Hall of Shame'' was a Volvo ad
that showed a Volvo standing up to the crushing weight of a truck
driven over its roof. The car had been specially reinforced to
survive the weight.
   Robert Austin, a Volvo spokesman, said the company never
intended to mislead the public and was not aware that the car in
the ad had been reinforced until after the ad aired.
   ``A mistake was made during the production of the commercial
which compromised its validity,'' Austin said. ``We went out and
told the public that with our own corrective advertisement.''
   Another ``winner' was Burger King, which advertised a ``Kid's
Club'' as ``fun, non-stop'' and flashed images of children happily
involved in what are presumably club activities.
   The real club offers only a membership card and some stickers,
said Action for Children's Television.
   Burger King spokeswoman Cori Zywotow said the clubs have 2.7
million members who receive a newsletter five times a year and
special meals at the restaurant.
   Asked if that counts as ``fun, non-stop,'' she replied: ``We
stand behind our kid's club program and our kid's club advertising
100 percent. It's been wonderfully successful and lots of fun.''
   Two major companies were cited twice by the watchdog groups.
   GM advertised its Cutlass Supreme model as ``fuel efficient''
even though it gets lower mileage than most of GM's other models,
according to the Safe Energy Communication Council.
   In addition, the Center for Auto Safety said the company
misrepresented itself by claiming in another ad that it ``pioneered
the airbag.''
   GM removed airbags from its cars after 1976 and fought
government rules that would have required them. It now equips fewer
models with airbags than Ford or Chrysler, the auto safety center
said.
   Philip Morris, the cigarette maker, got a Hubbard for a Virginia
Slims ad that, according to the National Women's Health Network,
implies a brand called ``Superslims'' can help women stay thin.
   Philip Morris spokesman Les Zuke called that allegation
``absurd.''
   Superslims, he said, ``makes two claims: Superslims emits 70
percent less smoke from the lit end and Superslims is an ultralight
cigarette that tastes good.''
   ``We have received no calls, no letters, no inquiries expressing
confusion by any consumers over this clear and simple message,''
Zuke said.
   Philip Morris also was cited for its ads championing the Bill of
Rights. The Coalition on Smoking Or Health dismissed the campaign
as a PR effort to defeat government restrictions on tobacco
promotion.
   Gus Buenz, a spokesman for Oldsmobile, said GM had airbags in
cars in 1974 and has a strong tradition of safety research. He said
the Cutlass ad was meant to highlight the car's roominess, price
and responsiveness, as well as fuel economy.
   ``All we're doing is telling people you can get all those things
plus 30 mpg'' on the highway, Buenz said.
   Other ``winners'' included:
   -Pan American Airlines for saying its transatlantic fleet is
among the youngest - and, by implication, the safest - in the air.
The airline counted recently overhauled planes as new to arrive at
that conclusion, according to the Aviation Consumer Action Project.
   -Kellogg for saying that protein in Special K cereal can help
women maintain healthy muscle tone while dieting. The Iowa attorney
general has alleged in federal court that the ads are misleading,
said the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
   Celeste Clark, vice president of nutrition marketing at Kellogg,
said the company stands behind the factual content of its Special K
advertising and has been saying it's a high-protein cereal for 35
years.
   ``We have tried to communicate the contribution Special K makes
to a sensible weight loss plan involving diet and exercise,'' she
said. ``The campaign is not meant to indicate that Special K alone
can help you lose weight.''
   -Coors Brewing Co. for Coors Light ads that feature a haunted
house and the line that ``it isn't Halloween without the Silver
Bullet.'' ``Its appeal to children is chilling,'' said the National
Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence Inc.
   -A company sponsoring ``Fabulous Hawaiian Sweepstakes,'' a
telephone ad delivered by an automatic dialing machine. The ad is
really a pitch for a 900-toll call that costs $6 and repeats what
you've already heard, said the Center for the Study of
Commercialism. The center said it doesn't know the name of the
contest sponsor.
   There was no immediate comment from other companies contacted
for their reaction to the criticism.

   United Parcel Service reported no
increase in absenteeism Monday, the first day of a threatened
sickout among UPS pilots.
   The Independent Pilots Association, which represents the
company's 1,200 pilots, said anonymous letters were sent out
telling members to call in sick Monday through Wednesday. The union
responded by sending members a letter saying a sickout was illegal
and asking pilots to ignore it.
   ``It appears that we may have been able to head this thing
off,'' said Robert M. Miller, president of the union. ``But some of
our pilots are stating that they don't think we should have stopped
it.''
   Miller said there was a great deal of frustration among the
pilots about the slow progress of negotiations for a new contract.
The pilots are working under terms of a Teamsters contract that
expired July 31.
   UPS said operations were normal Monday and the rate of
absenteeism was normal.
   ``There has been no sign of any job action, sickout, walkout or
slowdown and none is expected,'' said UPS spokesman Bob Kenney
said.
   Miller and UPS officials said they did not know who was
encouraging pilots to call in sick.
   ``We've had hundreds of phone calls and we said to ignore the
sickout,'' Miller said. ``Normally we don't respond to this type of
thing, but we want our position known.''
   UPS pilots transport almost 7 percent of the company's packages.
A widespread sickout would only dent UPS' total volume but could
cripple the company's overnight delivery service, its fastest
growing and most profitable division.
   UPS, the world's largest package delivery service, employs about
237,000 people. Most deliveries are made by truck.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Says It Received More Funding Offers for NCR Deal Than It
Needs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said Monday
it received more offers of loans from banks than it needs to
finance its hosile $6.1 billion takeover of NCR Corp.
   AT&amp;T said more than 50 major U.S. and international banks have
offered commitments for the $6 billion credit line the phone
company is establishing in its bid to buy the nation's
fifth-largest computer maker.
   AT&amp;T said the credit line will back short-term notes the phone
company plans to sell to finance part of the NCR bid. It also said
it may draw directly on the credit line for the funding.
   AT&amp;T met with bankers Thursday on the tender offer, which it
announced Wednesday.
   NCR has said it is not interested in being bought by anyone and
that it plans to fight the bid.
   Also Monday, a federal judge in Baltimore dismissed a suit by
AT&amp;T that sought to halt NCR from pursuing tactics to block the
takeover.
   U.S. District Judge Frederic N. Smalkin ruled that his court
does not have jurisdiction in the suit, filed Wednesday, because
AT&amp;T has not actually sought or obtained proxies from NCR
stockholders.
   NCR, a Maryland-chartered corporation, is based in Dayton, Ohio.
On Friday, NCR filed suit in Columbus, Ohio, asking a federal judge
to declare valid a strengthened ``poison pill'' anti-takeover plan
endorsed by NCR's board of directors.
   The existing poison pill would allow NCR to issue new stock to
its shareholders at half the price if a company seeking a hostile
takeover acquired 20 percent of its stock. The strengthened plan
would lower the threshold to 15 percent.
   AT&amp;T was seeking consolidation of the Ohio and Maryland suits
and asking that NCR not be granted approval for its latest
anti-takeover measure. AT&amp;T also asked that NCR not be allowed to
resort to two state anti-takeover measures, the Maryland Business
Combination Act and the Control Shares Act.
   AT&amp;T's lawyers said in court Monday that the phone giant is
``contemplating'' the use of proxies.
   In a proxy fight, a potential acquiring company seeks to unseat
the board of directors of the target corporation.
   Smalkin said AT&amp;T must first acquire enough NCR proxies to
ignite the takeover fight before he could consider legal action.

<TEXT>
   After nearly three years running the largest
and busiest outpost of the federal agency that keeps Wall Street
honest, Lawrence Iason said Monday he is stepping down.
   Iason, who took over as head of the Securities and Exchange
Commission's New York Regional Office Jan. 25, 1988, told SEC
Chairman Richard Breeden last week he planned to leave government
service to return to his old law firm.
   Iason's last day with the SEC will be March 15.
   ``I've spent about half my career in government,'' said Iason,
who clerked for a federal judge, served in the Watergate special
prosecutor's office and at the U.S. attorney's office in New York
during his legal career.
   ``Larry has made significant and substantial contributions to
the New York regional office and to the commission since his
appointment,'' Breeden said in a statement issued by his office.
   As head of the regional office, Iason, 45, oversaw a staff of
250.
   ``The time has come. I'm ready to go back to private practice,''
he said in a telephone interview from his office in lower
Manhattan.
   Iason is leaving government to become a partner at the New York
firm of Morvillo, Abramowitz and Grant. Otto Obermaier, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, is a former partner in the firm.
   Iason conceded that money was a large factor in his decision.
   SEC regional chiefs make between $71,200 and $83,600, ``a
significant difference from private practice,'' Iason said.
   Iason, who has three young children, said, ``I hate to make them
sacrifice for my benefit.''
   As head of the New York office, Iason presided over several key
investigations. One involved the Business Week insider trading
cases stemming from market-sensitive information leaked by
employees of the magazine's printers.
   Another led to an administrative action against the brokerage
firm Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. that concluded
with a settlement of more than $5.6 million for alleged misuse of
customer accounts.
   Iason took over an office in disarray after one regional
administrator left suddenly in 1987 and officials at SEC
headquarters virtually ran the New York office from Washington.
   William McLucas, who heads the SEC's Enforcement Division,
remembers the low morale and heavy workload in New York during the
three months he spent splitting his time between there and
Washington before Iason came on board.
   ``I think what you saw was an office that needed some strong
leadership. I thought Larry went in and really put the program back
together,'' said McLucas, adding, ``I'm sorry to see him go. I
think what he did with that office is remarkable.''
   Iason, a 1967 Yale graduate, received his law degree in 1971 at
New York University.

   Cray Computer Corp. announced
Monday it has received its first order for a 16-processor Cray-3
supercomputer, which is in development and scheduled to be
completed next year.
   The National Energy Research Supercomputer Center at the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California placed the order. The
center already has an eight-processor Cray-2 that was installed
last April.
   Cray Computer said the supercomputer center's order of both
computers comes to $42 million.
   The company said the Cray-3 will be delivered to the center in
phases beginning with a two-processor system scheduled for
installation at the end of 1991. Installation of the 16-processor
computer i expected to be completed by summer 1992, Cray Computer
officials said.
   ``We are delighted to have received our first order from such an
important supercomputer user as NERSC,'' said Neil Davenport,
president and CEO of Cray Computer.
   Cray Computer was spun off last year from Cray Research Corp. of
Minneapolis, a leading supercomputer maker, with the goal of
developing the Cray 3.
   Supercomputers are advanced scientific machines used in weather
forecasting, car design, simulation and other tasks that require
great computational power.

   The U.S. dollar opened sharply higher against the
Japanese yen Tuesday morning, while the key index on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange sank.
   The dollar opened at 131.87 yen, up 1.32 yen from Monday's close
of 130.55 yen.
   The dollar's recovery followed its advance in New York overnight
as the U.S. Federal Reserve took no apparent steps to push interest
rates lower, dealers said. Lower rates tend to reduce a currency's
value.
   Market players have been expecting the Federal Reserve to ease
monetary policy in an effort to revitalize the U.S. economy.
   ``The dollar in Tokyo is still rising gradually, but it will
stay in a range somewhere between 131.60-132.30 yen,'' said Chizuko
Satsukawa, a dealer with Chemical Bank.
   She said dollar-selling by exporters is preventing the currency
from rising above the 132.50-yen line for now, but ``the yen is
basically weakening, especially toward the end of the year, when
there is a substantial increase in demand for the dollar from
travelers and trading houses.''
   More than a million Japanese are expected to travel overseas for
the New Year holidays, and the majority of them buy dollars for the
trip.
   Satsukawa said another factor accelerating the yen's decline was
that Japanese investors were buying German marks in anticipation of
an interest rate increase in Germany following a Thursday meeting
of Germany's central bank.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost
304.13 points, or 1.28 percent, to move to 23,480.54 within the
first 15 minutes of trading.
   Dealers attributed the slide to a weakening yen and
profit-taking following consecutive gains in recent days. The index
has gained nearly 2,000 points since Wednesday.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond fell to 87.51 points in early trading from
Monday's 87.72-point close. Its yield advanced to 7.165 percent,
from 7.120 percent.

<HEAD>National Semiconductor Profit Jumps 45 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Semiconductor Corp. said
Monday its profit rose 45 percent in its second fiscal quarter,
boosted by a credit stemming from the company's recent
restructuring.
   For the three months ended Nov. 25, the company reported net
income of $3.5 million, or 1 cent a share, compared with $2.4
million, or zero cents a share, for the same period a year ago.
   Sales for period, its second fiscal quarter of 1991, were $427.4
million, compared with $416.8 million for the same quarter a year
ago, a gain of 2 percent.
   National Semiconductor said the quarter's results included a
$2.4 million credit reflecting the reversal of restructuring
charges stemming from the closure of its plant in Danbury, Conn.
   The company also announced during the quarter that it had signed
a letter of intent to sell its plant in Puyallup, Wash., to
Matsushita Electronics Corp. of Japan. The transaction is expected
to be completed by April.
   Charles E. Sporck, National Semiconductor's president and chief
executive officer, said the company had met financial goals it had
set for the quarter.
   ``The significant improvement in operating performance in this
quarter, compared to the first quarter of this fiscal year,
reflects the benefits resulting from the restructuring activity
which the company undertook this past August,'' he said.
   In the first quarter of its fiscal 1991, National Semiconductor
reported a loss of $165.5 million, or $1.63 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $21.9 million, or 24 cents  share, in the first
quarter of fiscal 1990. The first quarter's results included a
pre-tax charge of $143.6 million in connection with the
restructuring.
   In August, the company said it would lay off 2,000 employees and
close two factories.
   Sporck also said the company reduced its debt by $18 million and
its inventory by $20 million from the first quarter.

   A federal judge on Monday formally consolidated
65,000 asbestos injury claims against Eagle-Picher Industries Inc.
in a major step toward resolving a natiowide legal and medical
crisis.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein certified a class action
suit after a daylong hearing on a settlement proposal for
Eagle-Picher that faces opposition from nearly all victims'
attorneys involved in the case.
   Attorneys said they would fight Weinstein's consolidation of the
cases, saying the company's $625 million long-term settlement plan
provides too little money and too few safeguards for victims of
lung cancer and other respiratory ailments.
   Weinstein faces an additional roadblock in the formoof a
petition filed Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Cincinnati
seeking to force Eagle-Picher involuntarily into bankruptcy
proceedings. Under federal law, the bankruptcy petition puts all
other court action involving the company on hold.
   But Weinstein said the involuntary bankruptcy filing was
``fradulent on its face'' and he was moving ahead immediately to
certify the class action in spite of the bankruptcy petition. He
also froze all litigation involving Eagle-Picher except to pay $45
million in previously settled claims.
   The Cincinnati-based industrial products manufacturer has said
it would have to seek bankruptcy court refuge if no solution to its
asbestos problems were reached soon. Eagle-Picher is liable for
injuries caused by cement products containing asbestos it made from
1931 to 1971.
   The company has spent $540 million in the last five years on the
issue and faces an estimated $600 million in future claims. New
claims against the company are being filed at an average of 20,000
annually.
   Eagle-Picher Chairman Thomas Petry said he was pleased Weinstein
moved to create the class action. He called the involuntary
bankruptcy petition ``a desperate attempt ... to circumvent and
derail these proceedings.''
   The motion was filed by three asbestos victims who want
Eagle-Picher placed under bankruptcy court supervision on grounds
the company had failed to meet $19,200 in settlement payments. The
company said it had met all obligations to the victims, creditors,
lenders and other businesses.
   Plaintiffs lawyers acknowledged the filing was a strategic
maneuver to try to block the settlement plan being considered by
Weinstein. It would create a trust consisting of cash and company
stock to compensate workers made sick inhlaing asbestos.
   Weinstein also appointed former federal judge Marvin Frankel to
study whether Eagle-Picher claimants would receive more money in a
bankruptcy or through the proposed settlement. He also said he
planned to hold hearings on the fairness of the plan in New York,
Cincinnati and Detroit.
   Lawyers complained the judge is forcing a national asbestos
settlement without their endorsement. Weinstein wants a national
plan to avoid long and costly trials that sap money for victims,
some of whom have died before being compensated.
   Currently, more than 90,000 asbestos cases clog state and
federal courts. A separate case involves the cash-strapped Manville
trust fund, which faces 130,000 claims and is being reorganized
under orders from Weinstein.
   ``The plaintiffs have been deprived of an opportunity to be
heard,'' said Ron Motley, a Charleston, S.C., lawyer representing
several thousand asbestos victims.
   ``We are resigned to the impossibility of getting a fair hearing
in this court,'' said Steven Kazan, an attorney for the Asbestos
Victims of America, which has about 18,000 members.
   Only one of three lawyers appointed by Weinstein to represent
current Eagle-Picher victims has approved the plan, and he does not
have any asbestos clients. More than 90 attorneys with 40,000
asbestos clients signed a petition Monday opposing the settlement
plan.
   ``There is a massive lack of confidence in the settlement,''
Grant Hering, a New York plaintiffs lawyer, told the judge. ``For
people who are victims, who have suffered what they have suffered,
it is a gimmick they can't comprehend.''
   Under the plan, Eagle-Picher would pay $460 million in annual
payments over 20 years into the trust, plus $120 million from the
company's cash flow. It also would contribute $45 million to pay
settlements already negotiated.
   The trust would receive 25 percent of Eagle-Picher stock and 50
percent if the company failed to meet its annual payments after
five years.
   In an apparent attempt to quell some of the criticism of the
plan, which was presented to the court last week, Weinstein
modified it to grant the trust voting control of Eagle-Picher if
the company failed to meet annual payments during the plan's first
five years.
   He also said payments should begin by Nov. 30, 1993, regardless
of delays due to possible court appeals, and that victims should
not lose any rights agreed to in a settlement if Eagle-Picher
declared bankruptcy.

   Campbell Soup Co. has sold two of its
European businesses as part of a major restructuring to improve the
company's financial performance, the company said Monday.
   Campbell said it sold its ``Freshbake'' vegetable operations in
the United Kingdom and seafood businesses in the U.K. and Belgium
to Albert Fisher Group PLC for an undisclosed price. The units had
annual sales of about $150 million, Campbell said.
   The food units were among five businesses Campbell put up for
sale in May in a move to streamline the company's operations. Also
put up for sale were D. Lazzaroni &amp; C. SpA of Italy, and Campbell
Irish Foods Ltd. and Mallow Foods Ltd. of Ireland.
   ``This sale results from our strategic decision to focus our
European efforts on branded value-added prepared foods,'' Campbell
Chief Executive Officer David W. Johnson said in a statement
released by the Camden-based company.
