   They wait their turns in a special
area.
   Some sit quietly, alone. A few stretch muscles or pace nervously
on the patch of artificial grass. Others chat boisterously with
friends who came to watch, have jumped already or plan to go later.
   All steal glances at the oversize rubber bands to which they
will entrust their lives. Will they prove thick enough when,
suddenly, there is nothing below the feet but shallow water and
your body plunges toward it?
   This is bungee jumping, the sport of pumping adrenalin, pounding
heart and an unlikely blend of cold fear and wild exhilaration.
   Cameras click and whir. Second thoughts skitter across a few
faces when two candidates decide, after looking down from a steel
cage suspended 140 feet in the air by a crane, that bungee jumping
is not a good idea after all. They forfeit their $69 ($55 U.S.).
   Black clouds roll in. A rainstorm suspends operations as gusty
winds buffet the cage, making it sway. Nerves tense and minutes
drag by. Then the skies begin to clear and, below, the yacht
pennants droop.
   Jumpers are weighed to determine which of several cords will be
used to stop the fall 6 to 8 feet above water.
   Ankles are strapped snugly into heavy fabric-and-Velcro
bracelets that are attached to each other, with a loop for the long
cord. The other end is hooked to the bottom of the cage.
   What bravado there was seems to continue until the jumper is put
into the cage with two crew members, secured with a seat belt, and
the crane begins lifting it.
   On the way up, the jumper is coached in what to do on the way
down, how to overcome fear and get the most from the jump. The
spiel also seems designed to give the mind a focus and keep terror
away.
   ``If you look down and start to get scared, look at the
horizon,'' one crew member suggests. ``Put your toes on the edge of
the cage, then on our signal, jump.''
   Sounds simple, but a glance at the water below dries the mouth
and churns the stomach. The height looks great enough from the
ground, but the concept of 140 feet changes drastically with the
new perspective.
   In parachuting, the ground is so far down as to seem unreal.
Here, it's easy to pick out details. The people look like ants; the
yachts moored nearby are unfriendly shoals.
   A crewman unstraps the seat belt and opens the gate. The cage
moves in the breeze. Before there's too much time to think, and
freeze, there's a count of ``Three . . . two . . . one . . .
BUNGEEEEEEEE!!''
   Suddenly, there is nothing below but shallow water and the body
hurtles downward. The adrenalin that had started the heart pounding
now pours in.
   The queasy stomach seems to be left up there, somewhere, and the
weightless sense of free fall sets in just before the cord
stretches, stretches . . . and then ends the dive.
   It contracts again, then relaxes, contracts, like a rubber band,
and the jumper gets a feel for manipulating the bounces, like a
yo-yo or someone on a reverse trampoline.
   By the time the cage, and the jumper, are lowered to the ground,
the initial fear has been replaced by disappointment that it is
over. A crew member grabs dangling hands and leads the body to a
soft landing on a padded platform.
   Some of the spectators applaud as the anklets are removed. The
jumper stands, a bit unsteadily, and turns his attention to sorting
out the sequence and feelings of the last few moments.
   Another jumper is strapped into the cage.
   The roots of bungee are in Pentecost Island, part of the Vanuatu
chain in the South Pacific. Every May, when the yams are ready to
be harvested, young males go through a manhood ritual by jumping
from a homemade tower with vines attached to their ankles.
   The lowest platform is 30 feet and the highest more than 120. As
men gain stature in the village, they move up to higher platforms.
   Inauguration of the high-tech version is credited to the
Dangerous Sports Club of Oxford University in Britain. Members
dressed in tuxedos, among them Graham Chapman of Monty Python, made
several jumps from bridges about a decade ago, including San
Francisco's Golden Gate.
   In 1987, New Zealander A.J. Hackett made headlines when he and a
friend hid on the Eiffel Tower overnight and plunged through the
open center from the second level, a height of about 360 feet.
   Hackett brought bungee jumping back to New Zealand and
commercialized it. Thousands of people take the plunge there each
year and, in January at Auckland, the Commonwealth Games featured a
demonstration.
   A few of the comparatively rich and famous have given it a try,
including boxer Jeff Harding, rugby star Wally Lewis and singer
Deborah Harry, who went topless.
   John Fahey, industrial relations minister of New South Wales
state, delayed the Sydney operation for three months because of
health concerns, then gave the go-ahead to what he called
``glue-sniffing for yuppies.''
   But on Sept. 12, former Miss Australia Natalie McCurry and a
companion were injured when one of the cords attached to their feet
broke free as the couple made a joint 130-foot jump, leaving them
dangling with their heads just above water.
   In response, Fahey banned the sport in his state until a report
was completed on the accident, which left Ms. McCurry with a broken
collerbone. She and Andy Gulby, a staff member of the Bungee Bats
thrill-seeking group, also were treated for neck and back injuries.
   One fatality and a serious injury have been recorded in New
Zealand. France, where there were three deaths in 1989, recently
introduced regulations.

   Chile peppers burn your fingers and can make you cry and sweat,
but still, people come back for more. Cooks and diners over much of
the planet are devoted to them.
   ``The Whole Chile Pepper Book,'' published this week, is for
those who take chiles seriously. If you're among the unschooled,
thinking hot is some chiles and hotter is just some more, you have
a lot to learn.
   And these historians of heat, these cherishers of chiles, may
convert you.
   There are, of course, people who treat the fiery pods as a test
of their bravery, and authors Dave DeWitt and Nancy Gerlach tell
chile-eating contest tales such as John Espinosa's 1988 chow-down
of 29 jalapenos in two minutes flat.
   In 1956, Newsweek reported, contestants in Lousiana were
required to eat progressively hotter peppers and were penalized if
``they winced, shuddered or flinched,'' according to DeWitt and
Gerlach.
   But the authors frown on considering chiles merely a mild
danger.
   ``You ought to encourage people to appreciate the finer
qualities of chile peppers than only the burning sensation,'' said
DeWitt, who with Gerlach, a dietitian, has written two previous
cookbooks and edits the Whole Chile Pepper magazine in Albuquerque,
N.M.
   ``They're healthy, they're addictive - the more you eat of the
spicier foods, the less you want to go back to meat and mashed
potatoes,'' said Jane Butel, a chef and author who owns Pecos
Valley Spice Co. in New York City. ``A little bit can change the
entire complexion of food.''
   When a diner requested some hot sauce at the Fourth Street Grill
in Berkeley, Calif., recently, chef Kurt Koessel sent out crushed
red chiles, a bottled sauce from the Yucatan Peninsula and three
sauces from Belize.
   ``We want to make food that wakes up your mouth, food that isn't
just incidental on the table,'' he said. ``We want it to interrupt
the conversation.''
   To that end, his menu included pineapple habanero chile salsa
with mint and coriander; poblano chiles stuffed with smoked
chicken, apples and jicama; and even a cascabel chile creme brulee
(``You taste the sweetness first. That kind of coats your tongue
and when that fades away, the heat comes on at the end,'' Koessel
said).
   Chiles have at various times in various places been used as
currency, considered an aphrodisiac and been prized as a key to
eternal youth. The authors note their use for more than three dozen
ailments.
   Sometimes, they say, the peppers are cited as the cure and the
cause. Mexicans commonly treat stomachaches by chewing and
swallowing a Serrano chile, while Americans often complain that
chiles give them stomach trouble.
   Nutritionally, they're a bargain. Chiles contain few calories.
Three and a half ounces of fresh chiles contain more than twice the
recommended dietary allowance for vitamin C.
   And then, there's the firepower.
   The heat source, capsaicin, has no flavor, color or odor. It is
measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography in Scoville Units,
named for a pharmacologist who came up with an early measure of
heat.
   Habaneros, also called Scot's Bonnet or Scotch Bonnet, are the
hottest chile known, measuring 200,000 to 300,000 Scoville Units,
the authors say. They quote a Dominican priest, Francisco Ximenez,
as saying in 1722 that a single habanero pod would ``make a bull
unable to eat.''
   The authors quote a 1980 Science News report noting that a
single drop of capsaicin diluted in 100,000 parts of water will
produce a persistent burning on the tongue; diluted in 1 million
parts, it produces a perceptible warmth.
   ``We are not preaching that people submerge the flavors of food
in so much heat that they break out in a sweat and start gagging,''
DeWitt said. ``It does take some getting used to.''
   Novices might avoid, for example, recipes in ``The Whole Chile
Pepper Book'' for Pepper-Peanut Beef Kabobs from Nigeria, which
rate an eight on a heat scale from one to 10; the Berbere Paste
from Ethiopia, rated at nine; or the Sri Lankan Black Curry, an
eight.
   Most of the 180 recipes in ``The Whole Chile Pepper Book''
(Little, Brown and Co., $16.95 paperback) measure four to six, and
that's the range DeWitt said he generally enjoys.
   But the point is to eat chiles, he said. Daily.
   The only requirement of ``The Whole Chile Pepper Diet'' is
chiles in at least one meal a day, 365 days a year.
   ``I eat chile pepper in some form every day, sometimes just a
salsa on eggs. Today, I had a simple hamburger with sliced
jalapenos on it. Yesterday, I had some enchiladas,'' DeWitt said.
   ``I have to have them every day,'' Koessel said, adding that he
finds chiles erotic and curative as well as delicious.
   ``Sometimes you get into a macho thing with them,'' he said.
``On Sunday mornings at the restaurant, if we've had a long night
on Saturday, maybe had a little bit to drink, we have oysters with
habanero sauce. . . . You wake right up.''
   The authors say the earliest evidence of chiles in the human
diet is from Mexico, traced to 7500 B.C.
   Chiles, which are not related to black pepper, are native to
South America and inititally were spread by birds carrying seeds,
the authors say. Then Columbus brought seeds to Europe and from
there chiles were spread by exploring and trading powers, they say.
   Chiles now play featured roles in the foods of India, China,
Thailand, much of Africa and, of course, the Americas. Even in
Japan, where classic foods are not hot, the fastest-growing
fast-food chain of the last decade sold Mexican food, the authors
say.
   They estimate three-quarters of the world's population eats
chiles regularly.
   The United States was one of the last countries to catch on to
chiles. But when they fired up American palates, the palates stayed
hot.
   DeWitt said he recently completed a study estimating the market
at $2 billion to $3 billion wholesale for everything from fresh
chile pods to commercial salsas and T-shirts with chiles on them.
   The most popular chile dish in this country is Texas chili con
carne. Cookoffs have been held since the 1950s, and the authors
estimate 700,000 people attend annually.
   Perhaps one of the least popular uses was by employees of the
New York City subway system, who several years ago sprinkled token
slots with chile powder to prevent vandals from sucking tokens out
of the turnstiles. A Transit Authority spokesman said recently,
however, that was not policy: ``We did not have boxes of chile
powder in our supply houses.''

Golden Triangle drug region to meet the man U.S. officials describe
as one of the world's main narcotics traffickers.

   ``They say I have horns and fangs,'' opium
warlord Khun Sa declared with a laugh, curling fingers at his
temples to illustrate. ``Actually, I am a king without a crown.''
   ``They'' are American narcotics officials, who indeed describe
Khun Sa in devilish terms like ``The Prince of Darkness.'' They say
he is one of the world's main drug traffickers, exporting death
from opium poppy fields and jungle laboratories that refine the
sticky extract into heroin.
   His ``kingdom'' is a large slice of the Golden Triangle, the
tri-border area of Burma, Laos and Thailand where Khun Sa has been
an often dominant and ruthless figure for three decades.
   The 56-year-old survivor of battles, imprisonment and
double-crossing deals boasts that he controls 80 percent of the
drugs in Burma's Shan State. Khun Sa also claims his ultimate aim
is to eradicate narcotics, which flow by the ton to what he
describes as ``the drug-crazed West.''
   American officials, citing evidence of his involvement in
large-scale heroin shipments to the United States, indicted Khun Sa
in March and threatened to ``go after him if he can be located.''
   Going after Khun Sa would appear difficult, but his location is
no more secret than was that of Gen. Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian
strongman and alleged drug trafficker ousted and captured by U.S.
military forces.
   Khun Sa's headquarters is in a long, idyllic valley about nine
miles inside Burma, astride a road leading from the Thai frontier.
The few reporters invited to visit receive a friendly reception
after a grueling 11-hour mule ride.
   Ho Mong is neither the stereotype of a smuggler's lair nor a
plush hideaway like those of Latin American cocaine lords. It
includes an orderly village of several thousand people, schools, an
87-bed hospital, a large Buddhist temple and Tiger Camp, where Khun
Sa's Muang Tai Army is trained.
   ``The world sees me in a different way,'' he said in an
interview. Khun Sa wants the world to view him as a rebel general
fighting the Burmese government to liberate the Shan, one of many
ethnic minority groups suffering under an autocratic regime.
   With a motley group of Shan and Chinese, Khun Sa has built a
non-military organization they claim has won the loyalties of
several million people in Shan state. It includes a constitution
modeled on that of the United States and several political organs,
the most powerful led by Khun Sa's uncle, Khun Seng.
   He clearly commands the loyalty of many Shans, in Burma and
across the border in Thailand, but has a poor record of fighting
the Burmese government, which he described as ``the great enemy.''
   In fact, he has been on its side in the past and is shunned
today by the Karen, Kachin, Karenni and other rebel ethnic groups.
   Khun Sa acknowledges taxing opium that moves through his
territory, but denies refining it or trafficking in heroin. Western
and Thai narcotics sources say his empire includes laboratories
along the Thai-Burmese border and inside Laos.
   The opium warlord argues that, for 17 years, he has proposed
that the West buy the opium harvests he gathers and cooperate with
him to eradicate the drug problem at its roots. There have been no
takers.
   ``We have the opium; we have the heroin,'' said Seng Joseph, one
of Khun Sa's aides. ``We're the only ones who can stop the flow.''
   ``The DEA cannot stop it in a hundred years,'' he said of the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
   Several U.S. officials have visited Khun Sa over the years, and
he recently sent a videotape to President George Bush.
   It urges Bush to accept what Khun Sa presents as a six-year plan
to eradicate narcotics and turn the poverty-stricken Golden
Triangle into a ``World Garden'' of all-weather roads, tourist
hotels, international airport and prosperous peasants who no longer
must grow opium for survival.
   It was midmorning at Tiger Camp. Lingering mists swept the
surrounding hills as Khun Sa inspected recruits on the training
field. He was dressed neatly in light blue trousers and a striped,
white shirt.
   When asked if he was wealthy, Khun Sa said his expenses were too
high, especially for the army.
   ``Shan state is like a lawless state,'' he said. ``The people
who own more guns have the power.''
   He claims to have 20,000 men under arms, most of them teen-agers
from peasant families who apparently are happy to join up for the
monthly pay of 150 baht, the equivalent of $6. U.S. estimates place
his armed strength at just under 10,000.
   Khun Sa was in an expansive, jocular mood, shouldering a
recoilless rifle for photographers and giving soldiers tips on
firing a 60mm mortar.
   Beneath the swagger were signs of anxiety. He admitted all was
not well in his domain.
   A day earlier, reinforcements from Tiger Camp had marched out to
face the Wa in a months-long conflict over an important smuggling
corridor to the Thai frontier.
   Wa tribesmen once fought the government under the Burma
Communist Party's banner, but now are muscling in on Khun Sa's
territory with government help. The new arrangement is typical of
the Triangle's shifting alliances and bloody rivalries.
   The Wa are not Khun Sa's only worry.
   Because of the U.S. indictment, there is pressure on the Thais
to cut links indispensable to him. Thailand is Khun Sa's major
source of supplies and weapons, and aides say he has built a
network of relationships with Thai businessmen, officials and
military officers.
   Khun Sa scoffs at America's ``showcase war'' on drugs, directed
by what he describes as incompetent DEA agents, but admits to
having tightened security. He travels in a pickup truck mounted
with a machine gun, accompanied by six bodyguards carrying
battlefield weaponry.
   ``If the Americans put me into custody, they will have to feed
me,'' he said. ``What's the use? The poppy cultivation will just go
on and on.''
   Analysts generally agree getting rid of Khun Sa would merely
leave a temporary vacuum that other warlords would fight to fill.
   They also agree with his assessment that the opium trade is
flourishing. The U.S. government estimates Burma's opium output
doubled to 2,600 tons from 1988 to 1989.
   Western officials say that mountain of narcotics is the core of
Khun Sa's organization, not the Shan nationalism he professes.

<HEAD>Assad Visit To Tehran Raises Hopes For Hostages In Lebanon</HEAD>

   Syrian President Hafez Assad's visit to
Tehran next week comes amid signals from several quarters that some
of the Western hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants
in Lebanon could be released soon.
   Diplomats in Damascus, the Syrian capital, said Tuesday the
plight of the hostages is one of the main topics Assad will discuss
with President Hashemi Rafsanjani and other Iranian leaders.
   In Islamabad, capital of Pakistan, Iranian Ambassador Javad
Mansoori told a news conference Tuesday that an unspecified number
of the 13 Westerners held in Lebanon might be freed ``perhaps in
the next few days.'' Pakistan, a Moslem state like Iran, has been
used as an intermediary with Iran by the United States.
   Mansoori gave no details but said that Tehran has received
``promises'' from Shiite zealots holding the captives that some
will be released. He did not name the groups.
   Most of the hostages - six Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans and an Italian - are held by Shiite factions linked to the
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God. It is Tehran's main ally
in Lebanon.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon and Iran's main Arab
ally, has played a role in earlier hostage releases. Assad's visit
to Tehran follows talks in Damascus last week with Secretary of
State James Baker III during which they discussed the hostage
issue.
   Assad, long a maverick in the Arab world, has sided with the
United States in the Persian Gulf crisis against his longtime Arab
rival, Iraq. It is the first time Syria has been aligned with
Washington in any Middle East conflict. And Assad, cast adrift from
his longtime Soviet mentor because of detente, is eager to
establish new links with the West.
   Hopes that some hostages will be freed have brightened since the
Persian Gulf crisis set off by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The confrontation between Iraq, Iran's foe in their 1980-88 war,
and the United States has provided Rafsanjani with unexpected
benefits that have helped him consolidate power in the
faction-ridden Iranian hierarchy.
   Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists, has been
seeking to rebuild bridges with the West, despite opposition by
anti-Western radicals. He is believed to have had a hand in the
release of American educators Robert Polhill and Frank Reed in
April and in last month's freeing of Irishman Brian Keenan.
   When the United States rushed to aid threatened Saudi Arabia,
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was forced to cave in to Iranian
conditions for a peace treaty to end the Iran-Iraq war.
   Iraqi withdrew its troops from territory occupied in the
conflict, agreed to share sovereignty of the waterway forming the
southern border between the two countries, and began exchanging
prisoners of war.
   That boosted Rafsanjani's prestige. Also, in Tehran's eyes it
vindicated the Iranian contention that Iraq started the Persian
Gulf conflict and that Saddam would one day turn on wartime allies
like Kuwait.
   The U.N.-imposed embargo on oil exports from Iraq and occupied
Kuwait took 4 million barrels a day off the market and sent oil
prices soaring. Iran has made billions of dollars more than it
expected because of that.
   Informed Shiites and other sources said that 15 Iraqis and
Lebanese imprisoned in Kuwait for 1983 bombings escaped before the
Iraqi army took control and were safe. Their release, repeatedly
refused by Kuwait's desposed royal family, has been a key demand of
the kidnappers in Lebanon.
   The Iranians have insisted that recent hostage releases were
``goodwill gestures'' that had to be reciprocated by the United
States and its friends.
   France recently released Anis Naccache, a Lebanese serving a
life sentence for the attempted 1980 assassination of former
Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar in Paris.
   Syria's Ambassador to Iran, Ahmed al-Hassan, was quoted by the
English-language Tehran Times daily newspaper on Monday as saying
``further reciprocatory moves are needed by the West'' before any
more hostages could be freed.
   According to sources in various capitals, those gestures may
soon be forthcoming.
   Spurred by the Persian Gulf crisis, ``the United States has been
sending signals to Tehran that it wants to improve relations,'' one
source said.
   In Amsterdam, a Western source at the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal
said the two countries are within days of settling Iran's request
for payment of several hundred million dollars for military
equipment ordered by Iran before the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Delivery of the equipment was frozen by the United States that
year.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said another
Iranian claim, probably worth hundreds of millions of dollars, was
also close to settlement.
   U.S. sources have said the Bush administration will not object
to the payments to Iran, or to the World Bank providing loans of
several billion dollars to Iran. The World Bank is scheduled to
meet next week to consider Iranian requests for loans to help
rehabilitate areas devastated by a June earthquake.

   The Pentagon is ending operations or trimming
forces at 150 facilities overseas, but the commander of U.S. troops
in Europe says the cuts may not quickly translate into major cost
savings.
   ``Yes, there are some savings,'' said Gen. Bernard Galvin. ``But
I doubt they are going to be anything close to what everyone is
expecting.''
   The base closings and cutbacks, most of which will occur in
Europe, represent a reduction of up to 25 percent of the air
fields, barracks, training grounds and other facilities of Galvin's
command.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., chairwoman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on military installations and facilities,
said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's base closure list was a
disappointment.
   ``The Defense Department claims it will close 150 sites
overseas, but these sites include gas stations on the autobahn,
isolated housing units, athletic fields, and sites which had long
ago been slated for closure,'' she said.
   ``Facilities like these are closed every day at bases in the
United States with no DOD press release, no news conference, no
hoopla,'' she said.
   Galvin, who also is NATO's top military commander, said in an
interview that the cutback will result in a reduction in costs for
maintenance and military construction.
   But he said closing costs, including the cost of moving
thousands of U.S. troops back to the United States, repairing
environmental damage and destroying some weapons as spelled out in
arms control agreements, would reduce the impact of any savings.
   Savings, he said, likely will be reduced further when inflation
and rapidly rising costs for needed modern military technology are
considered.
   Pete Williams, the Defense Department spokesman, told reporters:
``Ironically, there are some costs associated with closing down
sites. But in the long run, of course, the goal is to end
operations and save money.''
   The reductions will occur over the next few years at sites in 10
countries that range from major bases to small installations.
   The Pentagon gave no official estimate of how much savings would
be realized or how many troops would be pulled out of the
facilities, many of which U.S. forces have occupied since the end
of World War II.
   The West German Defense Ministry said plans call for the pullout
by 1997 of about 60,000 U.S. soldiers from West Germany. The bulk
of the reductions will occur by 1993. About 250,000 American troops
are stationed in the country.
   But Galvin and Pentagon officials said decisions about troop
withdrawal remain to be made.
   ``Bonn is winging it,'' one Pentagon official who asked not to
be identified by name said about the statement from the West German
Defense Ministry.
   Military operations will end at 94 sites in West Germany, 11 in
Spain, nine in South Korea, three each in Greece, Italy, England
and Australia and one in Japan, Williams said.
   The United States also will reduce its forces at 14 sites in
West Germany, three in South Korea, two in Spain and at one site
each in Italy, Japan, Canada and Bermuda.
   While some of the sites involve small or minor facilities,
operations will end at three major bases - Torrejon Air Force Base
in Spain, and Hessich Oldendorf Air Base and Lindsey Air Base in
West Germany.
   Williams said the reductions are partly a matter of budget
necessity, partly a matter of warming relations with the Soviet
Union.
   ``As the threat changes in Eastern Europe, as the Soviet forces
pull back, as East European governments change and become
democratically elected, clearly the nature of our deployments
changes as well,'' he said.

<HEAD>Environmentalists, Cancer Researchers Urge Protection for Pacific
Yew</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead planned after 10 a.m. EDT news conference</NOTE>

   Environmental groups and cancer researchers
today urged federal protection for a tree found mostly in the
Pacific Northwest, saying it provides a scarce chemical compound
needed to treat ovarian cancer and possibly other cancers.
   Their petition asked Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan to list the
Pacific yew as a threatened species under the Endangered Species
Act.
   Environmentalists say the action could introduce a new element
into a bitter fight over proposals to limit timber cutting in the
old-growth Pacific Northwest forests to protect the northern
spotted owl. Industry officials say saving the owl could destroy
thousands of jobs in the region.
   ``The debate over the future of the ancient forests involves
much more than a choice between spotted owls and logging jobs,''
said Bruce Manheim, a lawyer and scientist for the Environmental
Defense Fund. ``Our ability to assure an adequate supply of this
novel anti-cancer compound, taxol, is at stake as well.''
   The fund planned a news conference to announce the petition,
signed also by several other leading environmental organizations
and by cancer researchers William P. McGuire of the Johns Hopkins
Oncology Center and Susan B. Horwitz of the Albert Einstein College
of Medicine, who conducted pioneering studies on taxol.
   The American Cancer Society was sending a separate letter to
Lujan backing the proposal to designate the Pacific yew a
threatened species.
   ``This action will ensure that women diagnosed with ovarian
cancer in the years ahead will have access to a promising drug
treatment,'' said the society's letter, signed by president Robert
Schweitzer. ``Taxol, while still under investigation through
clinical trials, is proving to be a very exciting compound for
treating this type of cancer.''
   In the 1960s, a wide-ranging plant screening program sponsored
by the National Cancer Institute found the first indications that
an extract of the Pacific yew's bark could be used against cancer.
The active chemical compound later was isolated and called taxol.
   ``Taxol acts by a mechanism different from other known
anti-cancer drugs, and has demonstrated confirmed activity against
refractory ovarian cancer,'' the petition to Lujan says. It may
also help treat breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, head and
neck carcinoma, gastric carcinoma and malignant melanoma, it says.
   But taxol is in very short supply, with researchers reporting
current supplies sufficient to treat perhaps 200 to 300 patients.
Alternate sources are not promising in the near future. About
20,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year in the
United States, and the cancer society said about 12,000 were
expected to die of the disease this year.
   The petition said there appears to be a short-term need for
about 600,000 large yew trees to develop taxol to treat ovarian
cancer, while only about 685,000 yew trees greater than 10 inches
in diameter remain on non-federal lands in California, Oregon and
Washington.
   ``The status of the species on U.S. Forest Service lands is also
precarious,'' the petition said. It identified major stands in the
Willamette and Umpqua National Forests in Oregon and the Nez Perce
National Forest in Idaho.
   The Pacific yew, or taxus brevifolia, is described as one of the
slowest growing trees in the world, appearing mostly as an
understory tree in the ancient forests of the Pacific Northwest.
   In addition, the groups said in their petition, the yew's thin
bark - which is the source of its medicinal value - also makes it
unusually vulnerable in logging operations.
   If the yew were listed as threatened, federal agencies would be
required to make sure any timber sales they approved did not
endanger the tree.
   The yews could, however, be cut to obtain bark needed to make
taxol, possibly in connection with logging of more commercially
valuable trees in the same forests.

<HEAD>American Ambassador Assures No Intervention in Coups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador to the
Organization of American States says the United States supports
democracy in the region but would not intervene against a military
coup.
   ``The United States supports the democratic system prevailing in
Latin America, but does not guarantee it,'' Luigi Einaudi told a
news conference on Tuesday.
   Einaudi had spoken in favor of moves afoot to reduce the size of
Central America's armed forces, and noted that would reduce the
possibility for coups. Reporters asked him whether U.S. policy was
to stop coups.
   ``The United States has committed itself to aid the democracies,
but it will not intervene if a coup occurs in any nation of Latin
America,'' he said.
   ``The United States would be limited to suspending relations
with the country affected ... and also it could cut its economic
aid,'' he said.
   He said he ``personally would work like a demon'' within the
organization to isolate any government installed by coup.
   The last Central American coups overturned military regimes in
Guatemala in 1982 and 1983. But military ultimatums and coup rumors
are a fact of life in most countries of the region.
   Einaudi spoke at the end of a six-day visit to Nicaragua and
Honduras.
   He said the United States supported moves to reduce militaries,
but added ``the security of each state should not be transferred to
the U.S. government ... because this type of security, of
sovereignty, never can be in the hands of others.''

   An envoy for U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar says the refugee relief effort in Jordan is
well-organized but hundreds of thousands of Asians remained
stranded in Iraq and Kuwait.
   On Tuesday 33,000 refugees remained in Jordan, down from a peak
of 500,000, the envoy, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, told a news
conference.
   ``On the whole, the response has been really amazing,'' said Aga
Khan, Perez de Cuellar's envoy on matters related to humanitarian
aid in the 6-week-old Persian Gulf crisis.
   Aga Khan said there was still no accurate way to assess how many
more refugees could be expected to cross into Jordan.
   ``Should there be hostilities, God only knows what we will do
with a lot of innocent human beings,'' he said.
   He said that if the hundreds of thousands of foreigners left in
Iraq and Kuwait were allowed to leave, relief officials would have
to reassess how to handle the influx and how to transport them
home.
   The envoy said part of his mission was to determine how much it
would cost to deal with a huge influx of new refugees and how that
cost would be paid.
   ``I don't think we can continue very long with piecemeal appeals
to donor countries,'' he said.
   Perez de Cuellar is expected to make a coordinated appeal for
more aid after he receives an assessment of the costs, Aga Khan
said.
   Iraqi troops overran Kuwait on Aug. 2 and Baghdad subsequently
annexed the oil-rich state. About 2,200 Americans, along with
thousands of other Westerners, remain trapped in the two nations,
prevented from leaving.
   Hundreds of thousands of mostly Arab and Asian nationals have
been allowed across Iraq's borders into Turkey and Jordan, filling
refugee camps and straining already tight resources in both
nations.

   Ugly giants and unsteady bridges are preying on
Whitney Houston's mind these days.
   The 25-year-old singer said she has spent the time since two
consecutive No. 1 albums making new friends, learning about
business and trying to decipher her recurring dreams.
   In one, a statue turns into an ugly giant ``8 or 9 feet tall,
kind of discolored,'' she said in the October issue of Life
magazine. ``He's always running after me but never gets me.''
   Another dream has her crossing the George Washington Bridge
between her home state of New Jersey and New York City.
   ``The bridge starts swinging,'' Ms. Houston said. ``It's raining
and snowing and sleeting. It's so windy the bridge turns upside
down. But I'm making it, I'm making it across.
   ``And when I'm almost there, a hand reaches out for me. It's a
man with white hair who says, `He told me to come for you,' and
lifts me up and puts me on the other side,'' she said.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Gov. Mario Cuomo says Buffalo is a baseball kind
of town.
   Cuomo appeared to poke fun at Florida baseball fans Tuesday
after Buffalo made its pitch for a National League expansion
franchise. Miami, St. Petersburg, Fla., and Orlando, Fla., are
among the other bidders.
   ``Miami is a wonderful town, but you can't look around and say
these are all baseball fans,'' Cuomo said. ``You even have jai alai
fans. Jai alai fans and baseball fans, they don't even drink in the
same places.''
   He added: ``There is something special about the Buffalo fans. I
don't know a lot of people in Buffalo playing croquet. I never saw
a polo match in Buffalo.''
   Cuomo was blunt in response to a question about whether it would
be fair to give New York a third baseball team to join the Mets and
Yankees when some states have none.
   ``We're New York,'' he said. ``We're supposed to have two. We
have 18 million people. How many do they have?''

   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Being governor didn't hurt Kay Orr when she
went back to college and was late to class.
   Students packed an English class Monday for Mrs. Orr's
appearance as part of a fund-raiser for the University of Nebraska
in which she traded places with a freshman.
   Luckily, Dave Lewis isn't one of those professors who lock the
door when class begins. He didn't even reprimand the governor for
arriving late.
   Mrs. Orr said she was a little nervous about her trip back in
time. She sat in a semicircle with other students in the class,
designed to help freshmen adjust to university life.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Chris Rock was only 8 when ``Saturday Night
Live'' made its raucous debut. Now, people are asking him if he's
haunted by the ghost of Eddie Murphy.
   Rock appeared unruffled Tuesday when the Murphy question came up
during a news conference to introduce him and another new cast
member.
   ``Eddie's still alive, ain't he?'' Rock asked.
   Rock, 23, a standup comedian since age 18, went on to say he
would bring his own perspective to the new season of the late-night
NBC variety show that first went on the air in 1975.
   ``I always wanted to be, like, a black guy on `Saturday Night
Live,' '' said Rock.
   ``I always wanted to be on it, too,'' said Chris Farley, 26, a
former Second City trouper and the other new cast member.
   Rock and Farley are replacing Jon Lovitz and Nora Dunn, who have
left the show.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Geffen Records cited differences in
``creative philosophy'' in announcing it will no longer distribute
albums by foul-mouth comedian Andrew Dice Clay and groups such as
the hard-rock band Slayer.
   The decision Monday to steer clear of the Def American label
came a month after Geffen decided not to distribute a new album
from Geto Boys because it felt the group glamorized violence,
racism and misogyny.
   ``We find ourselves increasingly at odds with Def American's
creative philosophy,'' Geffen said in a statement. ``A lot of
soul-searching went into this decision.''
   Def American's artists also include Danzig, The Black Crowes,
Wolfsbane, Trouble and The Four Horsemen.
   In a statement, the record label's founder, Rick Rubin, said,
``I believe strongly in my artists and am willing to personally
defend them.''

<HEAD>Apple Importers Vying With U.S. Producers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's apple producers have boosted
production in recent years, but Agriculture Department researchers
say imports will compete for the shopper's dollar this winter.
   In 1989, the farm value of the apple harvest was more than $1
billion, making it third among fruit crops behind grapes and
oranges.
   Apples are grown practically everywhere, but the top three
states - Washington, New York and Michigan - account for 69 percent
of the total, says a report by the department's Economic Research
Service.
   Large plantings in the late 1970s and early 1980s have increased
U.S. production and probably will continue to do so over the next
few years.
   ``These ample supplies have come on the market at a time when
other major producing nations, such as Chile, New Zealand and South
Africa, have dramatically expanded their output,'' the report said.
   Located in the Southern Hemisphere, these countries can ship
fresh apples when the United States is drawing on cold-storage
supplies.
   ``Since consumers generally prefer fresh apples, such exports
enjoy an advantage in markets where they compete with U.S. storage
apples,'' the report said. ``The combination of higher overall
world production and stable domestic demand is forcing U.S. prices
down.''
   Moreover, U.S. apple exports have declined the last few years,
from 305,328 metric tons in the 1980-81 marketing year to 249,238
tons in 1988-89.
   Canada, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Singapore, although
representing only 25 percent of the global market, accounted for 82
percent of the U.S. apple exports in 1987, the report said.
   U.S. apple producers are trying to increase demand in a number
of ways, including advertising and promotion campaigns to boost
domestic consumption. The report said there is some evidence that
is working.
   In the 1988-89 marketing year, domestic apple consumption rose
to 2.64 million tons, from 1.99 million tons the previous year and
1.9 million tons the year before that.
   ``Expanding domestic production, rising imports and stable
demand at home are pushing down prices for U.S. apples,''the report
said. ``These lower prices are making it hard for U.S. apple
farmers to meet their costs of production and increasing the
desirability of extending markets abroad.''
   The report was in the October issue of Farmline magazine and was
based on material supplied by USDA economists Amy Sparks and Boyd
Buxton, and James Seale of the University of Florida.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Cigarette consumption may decline 3 percent
this year, following an even sharper downturn in 1989, according to
Agriculture Department analysts.
   Total U.S. cigarette production, however, is expected to
increase in 1990, reflecting growth in the export market, the
department's Economic Research Service said Tuesday in a report.
   ``However, increased cigarette prices, health concerns, smoking
restrictions and declining social acceptability of smoking might
cause U.S. cigarette consumption to fall about 3 percent,'' the
report said.
   In 1989, total domestic use plummeted 5 percent, the sharpest
decline in six years.
   Officials said this year's drop would lower the per capita
cigarette use further from the 1989 average of 2,926 per year, the
lowest since 1942. The peak was 4,345 cigarettes per capita in
1963, before beginning a long decline.
   The average is for all Americans 18 and older, smokers and
non-smokers alike. It is a statistical comparison only and does not
indicate the actual smoking habits of the population.
   Economists said U.S. tobacco production in the 1990-91 crop year
is up about 13 percent because of increased acreage and larger
yields.
   ``Despite lower stocks, the larger crop and prospects for a
continuing decline in U.S. cigarette consumption have kept
flue-cured auction prices below a year earlier,'' the report said.
``However, cash receipts from the 1990 flue-cured crop are expected
to surpass last year's level.''
   The flue-cured tobacco harvest was estimated earlier this month
at 892 million pounds, up 10 percent from last year.
   Burley production, at 568 million pounds, is up 18 percent from
last year.
   ``Because of the small 1989 (burley) crop, ending stocks on
Sept. 30 are projected at about 11 percent lower than last year,''
the report said. ``The 1990-91 supply will be down about 3 percent
from a year earlier, representing about 2.3 years use.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. peanut crop isn't exactly peanuts,
but it's not the biggest in the world, either. Third place is more
like it.
   A report by the department's Foreign Agricultural Service put
estimated global production at more than 21.6 million metric tons.
One ton is about 2,205 pounds.
   The U.S. harvest this year is expected to be 1.61 million tons,
with more than 20 million tons accounted for by other countries.
   India is the largest producer at 7.3 million tons this year,
followed by China at 5.8 million tons.
   Other significant producers include Argentina, 430,000 tons;
Senegal, 670,000; South Africa, 240,000; Sudan, 400,000; and
``others'' not identified, 5.18 million tons.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Not About to Abandon Capital Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Texas oilman George Bush has been
crusading to cut the capital gains tax for the past quarter of a
century - with his distaste for the tax possibly deepened by a 1984
run-in with the Internal Revenue Service.
   The current hangup in budget talks is largely due to a deadlock
between the White House and the Democratic congressional leadership
on the tax that Bush first tried to lower as a junior congressman
in the mid-1960s.
   Without a budget deal or a change in the Gramm-Rudman
budget-balancing law, automatic cuts of about $100 billion will be
triggered after Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year.
   The cuts, evenly divided between defense and domestic programs,
would have a devastating impact on government programs and further
endanger an already frail U.S. economy.
   Although publicly the White House says it will keep plugging
away, privately officials have been increasingly pessimistic that a
pact can be reached in time to avoid the cuts.
   One senior administration official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said Tuesday that a deal may in fact be beyond grasp
``until the reality sinks in'' after a few days under the harsh
spending cuts.
   The administration is hoping that the Persian Gulf crisis will
make it easier to forge an eventual pact more to its liking, by
focusing public attention on the condition of the economy and by
helping marshal a stronger argument for only modest cuts in defense
spending.
   However, the $1 billion-a-month price tag of the U.S. military
effort and the potential growth of oil prices makes the pact itself
that much harder to forge.
   Bush's heels seem firmly dug in on his insistence for a lower
capital gains rate.
   His repugnance for the tax - levied on the sale of real estate,
stocks, works of art and other assets - dates back to his oil field
business background, associates say.
   In the 1960s, Bush championed a lower capital gains rate as a
junior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Then, and now,
Bush argued that lower capital gains rates would encourage business
investment and economic growth.
   He has strongly disputed Democratic contentions that a lower
capital gains tax would benefit mainly the rich.
   Capital gains are taxed at the same rate as other income - up to
33 percent. Bush would like to cut the rate to 15 percent.
   Democrats have offered to cut it to 23 percent. But they want
something in return - such as a surcharge on the wealthiest
taxpayers.
   Bush advocated lower capital gains taxes throughout his
presidential campaign and through the first 20 months of his
presidency. In fact, efforts to strike a bipartisan budget
agreement also broke down last year over a disagreement on the tax.
   Both the House and the Senate voted for a lower capital gains
rate last year, but the plan died in a Senate filibuster. Coming so
close to victory served to further whet the administration's
appetite for winning the tax reduction this year.
   Bush's 1984 brush with the IRS - which disallowed his efforts to
claim a tax deferral on his vacation home in Kennebunkport - may
have sharpened his zeal to reduce the tax.
   Bush had tried to shield himself from paying a capital gains tax
when he sold his five-bedroom home in Houston in 1981 for $843,273.
Bush argued that he used the money to buy his more expensive home
in Kennebunkport.
   Homeowners usually can defer paying capital gains taxes when
they sell one principal residence and purchase another more
expensive one.
   However, the IRS said the seaside home in Maine was not a
principal residence. Bush and his wife Barbara were hit with a
$144,000 bill for back taxes and $54,000 in interest penalties.
   According to his 1989 tax returns, released by the White House,
Bush paid taxes last year on $36,068 in capital gains generated by
his blind trust.
   Bush made it clear this week that he's not about to abandon his
call for lower capital gains taxes.
   He told a Republican fund-raiser in Denver on Tuesday that a cut
in the capital gains tax ``which will create jobs'' was one of a
number of ``growth-oriented tax incentives'' vital to a budget
package.
   The day before, he told a news conference in Washington that
such a tax cut ``is something I really believe is necessary to
stimulate the economy.... And I have not changed my view on that.''

   In the 1950s, industrialist William Lane's
voracious appetite for American art was limited only by the size of
his car.
   ``If it didn't fit into the back of my station wagon, I wouldn't
buy it,'' he reminisced, years after amassing what is considered
one of the finest collections of early 20th-century American works
by such artists as Georgia O'Keeffe, Arthur Dove, Stuart Davis and
Marsden Harley.
   Now, Lane has given 75 of those oil paintings, watercolors and
drawings to the Museum of Fine Arts, the museum's largest donation
in 40 years. They went on display Tuesday night.
   The gift to the Boston museum, already noted for its collections
of 18th and 19th century art, ``transforms our American painting
collection,'' director Alan Shestack said Tuesday.
   The collection ``makes us a real center for 20th-century
American art, which we could not have said yesterday,'' he said.
``Suddenly, in one fell swoop, we have gone from having very little
to having a very distinguished collection.''
   The gift from the William Lane Foundation, based in Lunenburg,
includes four works by O'Keeffe, seven by Davis, 12 by Dove and
three by Harley.
   Lane, a retired plastics manufacturer, began collecting
paintings in the 1950s. Guided primarily by his instincts, he
``slowly amassed what turned out to be a spectacular collection,''
Shestack said.
   Efforts to reach Lane and his wife, Saundra, were unsuccessful.
Their telephone number in Lunenburg is not listed. Lane recounted
his collecting habits in a statement issued by the museum.
   His finds include O'Keeffe's much-reproduced painting of 1936
``Deer Skull with Pedernal,'' which depicts a stylized deer skull
suspended on a blackened tree limb; Stuart Davis' pivotal abstract
``Egg Beater 3'' of 1927-28, and Dove's 1944 masterpiece ``That Red
One.''
   Lane ``appreciated these paintings at a time when they were
being overlooked by almost everyone else,'' Shestack said. ``They
represent the birth of abstraction in American art.''
   Lane's collection has been exhibited frequently at the Museum of
Fine Arts and around the world. He approached trustees of the
Boston museum this summer about making his permanent donation,
Shestack said.
   Lane is an honorary trustee at the museum, and his wife is a
trustee.
   The collection hung in the museum's central first-floor gallery,
which has been renamed the William H. and Saundra B. Lane Gallery.

<HEAD>Support Down For Israel; Negative Feelings Toward Japan, Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are far less supportive of Israel
than they were three years ago, according to a new opinion survey
that also found growing negative feelings toward Japan and Mexico.
   ``Growing dislike for Israel is evident across all demographic,
political and social groups, except among American Jews,'' said the
Times Mirror survey titled ``The People, the Press &amp; Politics
1990.''
   The survey found that 44 percent rated Israel favorably and 45
percent unfavorably. Three years ago, the split was 65 percent
favorable and 27 percent unfavorable.
   That finding was disputed by Malcolm Hoenlein, executive
director of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish
Organizations, who called it ``inconsistent'' with other surveys of
American attitudes toward Israel.
   The survey also found that as economic expectations of people
have declined, anti-Japanese sentiment has soared.
   ``Dislike for the Japanese has become more mainstream,''
concluded the survey. ``It is no longer primarily concentrated
among the kinds of people who have been hit especially hard by
Japanese competition.''
   The news was equally bad for the Republican and Democratic
parties. According to the Times Mirror survey, Americans have
become increasingly alienated from the parties as well as from
government in general.
   Even among the strongest supporters of the Democratic Party, it
was viewed as ``incapable of governing America successfully and
unclear on what it should stand for.''
   Despite the Republican success at holding the White House, the
survey concluded the party ``has been unable to capitalize on these
declining Democratic fortunes because the GOP itself is now seen by
a majority of the public as the political instrument of the
nation's rich and powerful.''
   ``I'm not at all disheartened by those findings,'' said
Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown.
   He noted that the survey was conducted at a time when the
Republican president has very high approval ratings, but that
nonetheless it ``reinforces the point that we've been trying to get
across, namely, that the Republican Party is the party of the
privileged few.''
   Brown said his party must do a better job of getting across the
point that Republicans ``have been in charge of government for the
last decade. It hasn't been Democrats, and Republicans have failed
totally in managing this government.''
   The findings were based on face-to-face interviews in May with
3,004 adults. A random sample of 1,000 was re-interviewed between
Aug. 19 and 25. The responses for the overall sample had a margin
of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.
   The responses were analyzed by Princeton Research Associates and
compared to the findings of a similar study conducted in 1987.
   Hoenlein said the finding that 44 percent of Americans back
Israel was ``a strong statement'' of support.
   ``I would say that the negative was completely inconsistent with
every other finding that I see,'' he said.
   A New York Times-CBS poll conducted in June said 61 percent of
people questioned supported sustaining or increasing levels of aid
to Israel. A Washington Post-ABC poll last year said 72 percent
favored maintaining or increasing aid to the Middle East country.
   The American Jewish Committee commissioned a poll by the Roper
Organization that was conducted in May and asked people whether
they found themselves more in sympathy with Israel or with the Arab
nations. That survey found 39 percent saying their sympathies were
more with Israel, while 9 percent said they were more with the Arab
nations.
   When that question was posed in February 1987, 48 percent said
their sympathies were more with Israel.
   In the Times Mirror survey, when asked about attitudes toward
Japan, 56 percent gave a favorable opinion and 39 percent
unfavorable. Three years ago, 69 percent viewed Japan favorably and
27 percent unfavorably.
   The greatest increases in unfavorable opinion toward the
Japanese occurred among whites, men, upper-income earners and those
in the Western United States, the survey found.
   The survey also found growth in the already large numbers of
Americans feeling alienated from their government.
   Among the findings were these:
   -Thirty percent said they agreed completely with the statement
that ``generally speaking, elected officials in Washington often
lose touch with the people pretty quickly.'' Three years ago, 22
percent agreed completely.
   -The majority who felt people like themselves have no say in
what government does grew from 52 percent in 1987 to 57 percent in
1990.
   -The number of people who said that elected officials care what
they think declined from 47 percent to 44 percent.
   -Thirty-eight percent said they agreed completely with the
statement ``It's really true, the rich get richer and the poor get
poorer.'' That was an increase from 31 percent in 1987.

<HEAD>Iraqis Told US Soldiers Afflicted With AIDS, Drugs, Alcohol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pro-Iraqi media contends that American
soldiers sent to Saudi Arabia are afflicted with all the
manifestations of U.S. decadence, including AIDS, alcohol, drugs
and a yearning for prostitutes.
   The Iraqi people also are being told that Israel, far from being
a peripheral player in the Persian Gulf crisis, has sent planes,
tanks and soldiers to Saudi Arabia, all elaborately disguised as
being part of the American arsenal.
   A U.S. Information Agency analysis of the pro-Saddam Hussein
media in Iraq and elsewhere says there has been an ``extremely
active'' disinformation campaign waged against the United States
and U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   ``Although many Iraqi disinformation claims are crude and
patently false, past experience with disinformation campaigns
indicates that even the most outrageous claims can be widely
believed,'' the analysis said.
   Some examples of claims found in the Iraqi media or sympathetic
news outlets elsewhere:
   -The Pentagon has arranged to send two groups of 5,000 Egyptian
women each to provide for the ``sexual satisfaction'' of American
servicemen in Saudi Arabia.
   -U.S. troops, 40 percent of whom are suffering from AIDS, are
occupying and defiling Moslem holy places in Saudi Arabia.
   -Some military planes in Saudi Arabia are actually Israeli
planes disguised as U.S. aircraft. The Israeli pilots have been
provided with U.S. identity cards and American-sounding names.
   -Saudis resent the U.S. military presence in their country and
have sabotaged U.S. military equipment. In response, U.S. forces
have killed some Saudis.
   -U.S. forces are dumping nuclear waste in the Saudi desert.
   -Even if Iraq had not invaded Kuwait, the United States and
other countries would have sent forces into Kuwait.
   -The United States and other countries are covertly trading with
Iraq in violation of the United Nations embargo.
   A station identifying itself as ``Holy Mecca Radio'' has been
broadcasting tendentious messages about the American presence to
listeners in Saudi Arabia, purportedly from Saudi territory, the
analysis said.
   ``The American foreigner is on our land,'' a recent broadcast
said. ``The U.S. soldier ... has his customs and traditions, which
include drinking alcohol, eating pork and practicing prostitution.
... The American soldier has come with all the manifestations of
decadence dominating U.S. society - drugs, prostitution and AIDS.''
   Iraq, meanwhile, has claimed for weeks that the Bush
administration has been operating its own disinformation campaign
by contending that U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia are on a defensive
mission.
   Iraqi spokesmen have noted that the U.S. military arsenal in
Saudi Arabia, in addition to defensive arms, includes offensive
weaponry such as the stealth fighter-bomber for use in a possible
attack on Iraq.
   All of the disinformation claims that have turned up over the
past six weeks have appeared in the Iraqi media except the one
involving Egyptian prostitutes, the USIA study said.
   That story may have been an Iraqi disinformation plant, the USIA
study said. The story appeared in the ``Times of India'' on Aug.
13, a few days after Bush committed U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia.
   After the initial 10,000 Egyptian women were sent, the account
predicted that the number eventually would rise to 100,000. Its
alleged source was an unnamed ``sort of `opposition' Arabic
newspaper published in London,'' the USIA report said. It added
that the Times of India immediately terminated its relationship
with the author.
   The article was reprinted in Bangladesh and similar story
appeared in an Islamic newspaper in Malaysia.
   The claim about Israelis masquerading as Americans was made as
the first American forces were being sent to Saudi Arabia. The
Iraqi Armed Forces General Command spokesman contended that the
Israelis were planning to attack Iraq.
   The Iraqi News Agency distributed embellished versions of the
story later in the month, inspiring similar accounts in a number of
other Arab countries.

<HEAD>Poisonous Medication Kills more than 100 Children in Nigeria</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANK AIGBOGUN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nigeria is going through a parents'
nightmare - medicine for their children that turns out to be
poisonous.
   Health Minister Olikoye Ransome Kuti announced Tuesday that more
than 100 children have died in the past month after taking a
tainted syrup prescribed as a painkiller.
   Ransome Kuti told a news conference that first word of the
danger came from Ibadan, 80 miles north of Lagos, when 102 children
fell ill in late July.
   Investigations showed the children, who had been in several
Ibadan hospitals, all had taken a patent syrup to kill pain.
Eighty-five of the victims died, he said.
   Reports in Lagos newspapers say more than 240 children have been
killed by the poisonous mixture.
   Most victims were between six months and six years old.
   Prescription of the syrup to children under 10 years old was
temporarily banned in Nigeria on Thursday.
   Ransome Kuti said laboratory tests showed the lethal painkiller
was using ethylene glycol as a base instead of propylene glycol.
Ethylene glycol causes kidney failure, the minister said.
   He said the source of the ethylene glycol had been traced, but
refused to indicate whether the case was being treated as one of
wrong labeling of drugs or production of bootleg medication.
   Nigeria's government has been fighting such bogus medications
for more than a year. Licensed and unlicensed drug stores sell
them, as do street hawkers and vendors in marketplaces.
   The government last year legislated against producing such
medicines and introduced prison sentences of up to a year and stiff
fines for those convicted.
   Government investigations took officers to Far Eastern countries
like Taiwan, Korea and Singapore, where Nigerians fly to buy fake
drugs.
   Endemic corruption in the country involves port officials and
customs officials who turn a blind eye, Ransome Kuti said in an
interview with The Associated Press earlier this year.
   Between 40 percent and 50 percent of drugs available in Nigeria
are fake or substandard, the U.N. World Health Organization
representative in Nigeria, Dr S.H. Brewer-Graves, said in an April
interview.
   ``The morbidity rate is very, very serious,'' he said.
   This oil-rich nation's economy has been drained by slumping
petroleum prices that have hit people hard. Many opt for the
bootleg medications becaue they are cheaper.
   Fake medications reach a huge market in Nigeria, which has more
than 100 million people and is the most populous nation in Africa.
   Open borders in the region have allowed the killer drugs to
surface in other countries, notably Sierra Leone.

<HEAD>Congress Sends Textile Bill to White House for Third Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is sending a bill to limit U.S.
imports of textiles, clothing and shoes to the White House for the
third time in five years without enough votes to override a
promised presidential veto.
   President Bush has called the bill a ``threat to the stability
of the world trading system,'' while proponents argue that the
United States is failing to protect the foundation of its
manufacturing industry.
   ``Every nation except ours stands up for its people,'' said Rep.
Ed Jenkins, D-Ga. ``We are exchanging $10- and $12-an-hour jobs for
$4-an-hour jobs every day. Little by little we are giving away our
entire manufacturing base.''
   The House on Tuesday approved the legislation that would
restrict further growth of fabric and apparel imports to 1 percent
a year and freeze shoe imports at 1989 levels. But the 271-149 vote
was five votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to override
a presidential veto if all 433 members vote.
   The Senate passed the same bill in July on a vote of 68-32, two
more than necessary to override a veto.
   President Reagan vetoed nearly identical legislation in 1985 and
again in 1988. Bush has pledged to do likewise.
   ``It represents the worst form of economic policy for America,
one based upon the mistaken belief that less trade throughout the
world will somehow save American jobs and enhance our prosperity,''
Bush said in a letter to House leaders.
   Supporters contend the legislation is needed to stop the erosion
of more than half a million U.S. jobs in the three industries in
the past 17 years as imports have grabbed a dramatically larger
share of the U.S. markets.
   Imports, they said, account for more than one-third of the
clothing and 80 percent of the shoes sold in the United States,
boosting the nation's trade deficit by $26.5 billion last year.
   Opponents, however, contend the new protections would raise an
average family's clothing costs by $100 a year through higher
prices and invite retaliation against U.S. farm, technology and
service exports.
   The administration and other critics said the bill would scuttle
a four-year effort under the Uruguay Round of the 100-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to lower other nations'
barriers to U.S. exports.
   ``It makes the Congress appear hypocritical,'' said Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, which oversees U.S. trade relations. ``How can we expect
other countries to observe trade agreements when we won't observe
them ourselves?''
   Opponents say lawmakers show little reluctance to buying their
own clothing overseas. Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., the bill's
primary sponsor in the Senate, last week acknowledged ordering
custom-made suits from a South Korean tailor.
   ``Without mentioning any names, there are members on both sides
of this issue who are very proud to have their suits made in
Seoul,'' said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif. ``The American consumer
should have the exact same right that all these members of Congress
have.''
   Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said families already are paying about
$250 a year more than they should for clothing because of 18
percent tariffs on imported textile and apparel, compared with 4
percent tariffs on most other manufactured products.
   The bill would require the administration to establish
nation-by-nation quotas on U.S. imports of textiles, apparel and
leather, vinyl and plastic shoes, except for products from Canada
and Israel, which have free-trade agreements with the United
States.
   Textile and apparel imports would be allowed to grow only 1
percent a year and non-rubber shoe imports would be frozen at 1989
levels.

<HEAD>Chemical Polluters Agree to Reduce Cancer-Causing Emissions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine major chemical polluters plan sizable
reductions in cancer-causing emissions from 30 plants states over
the next three years as a result of arm-twisting by the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said Tuesday the planned
pollution cuts, although only a small portion of the 2.4 billion
pounds of toxic industrial chemicals released annually, are
significant because they come from plants where the cancer risks
are considered highest.
   The voluntary reductions were agreed upon after lengthy
negotiations with the agency. Reilly said that under current laws
it would be exceedingly difficult and time-consuming to force
similar emission cuts.
   The nine corporations are among the major petrochemical
companies in the nation. They are BASF, Dow Chemical Co., Exxon
Corp., General Electric, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., Occidental,
Reichhold, Texaco and Texas Petrochemical.
   Most of the reductions, totaling nearly 9.5 million pounds
annually, were scheduled to be made from within a few months to two
years. General Electric said it would meet the cuts by the end of
1993.
   A number of other companies, such as Du Pont and Monsanto, have
previously announced plans to significantly reduce toxic emissions,
but were not part of the discussions with the EPA.
   Under the agreement, releases of cancer-causing chemicals will
be cut by about 80 percent at the 30 plants in 14 states, the EPA
said. The planned reduction covers six cancer-causing chemicals.
   The action comes as Congress nears approval of tougher pollution
control legislation that will require industry to sharply reduce
toxic emissions from factories over the next seven years.
   David Doniger, a specialist on toxic industrial pollution for
the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that while the
voluntary reductions are welcomed, they are not believed to go
beyond what the legislation in Congress will require anyway.
   ``At most it's a small down payment on the reductions that are
needed to protect people from these high-risk chemicals at
plants,'' he said in an interview.
   Although the planned cuts are only a small share of the total
annual emissions, Reilly called the companies' actions ``quite
significant'' because the reductions will come from plants where
the EPA considers the cancer risks among the highest.
   For example, one plant is the Texaco facility in Port Neches,
Texas, where the EPA has estimated the cancer risk to be as high as
1 in 10 for a lifetime of sustained maximum exposure to toxic
chemicals. Texaco has promised to reduce emissions of butadiene, a
carcinogen, by 1.2 million pounds at Port Neches by February.
   Twelve of the plants under the agreement have cancer risk levels
of at least 1 in 100 over a lifetime if a person were to live at
the plant boundary, the EPA said.
   But the voluntary reductions by the nine companies don't cover
dozens of other refineries and perochemical plants where the EPA
estimates comparable health concerns.
   The 30 plants are among 182 cited by the EPA last year as posing
a worrisome level of cancer risk because of toxic releases into the
air. These 182 plants in 1988 released more than 34 million pounds
of the six chemicals covered by the agreement, the EPA said.
   Ten of the plants are in Texas and four are in Louisiana. Others
are in Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Georgia, California, Connecticut,
Michigan, West Virginia, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina
and Delaware.
   Here is a list of the plants involved, by manufacturer:
   BASF: Geismar, La.; Monaca, Pa.; Chattanooga, Tenn. (2 plants).
   Dow Chemical: Freeport, Texas; Dalton, Ga.; Gales Ferry, Conn.;
Midland Mich.; Pittsburg, Calif.; Plaquemine, La.
   Exxon: Baytown, Texas; Baton Rouge, La.
   General Electric: Washington, W.Va.; Ottawa, Ill.; Mount Vernon,
Ind.
   Goodyear: Houston, Texas; Beaumont, Texas; Akron, Ohio; Calhoun,
Ga.
   Occidental: Bayport, Texas; Beaumont, Texas; Castle Hayne, N.C.;
Convent, La.; Deer Park, Texas; Corpus Christi, Texas; Belle, W.Va.
   Reichhold: Cheswold, Del.; Kensington, Ga.
   Texaco: Port Neches, Texas.
   Texas Petrochemicals: Houston, Texas.

   The Bush administration's ambiguous behavior
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait may have led Saddam Hussein to
believe the United States would not resist such a move,
congressional Democrats contend.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., sternly reminded Assistant Secretary
of State John H. Kelly on Tuesday of his testimony before the
Foreign Affairs Middle East subcommittee July 31, just two days
before the invasion.
   After reading Kelly's words from a transcript, Hamilton
concluded: ``You left the impression that it was the policy of the
United States not to come to the defense of Kuwait'' in the event
of an invasion.
   The administration also has been criticized for failing to heed
warning signs about the same time during a meeting between Saddam
and U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie, who left Iraq for a vacation
just before the invasion.
   ``The obsequious treatment of him (Saddam) by a large number of
high-ranking officials encouraged him to take that action, and
there's no escaping that responsibility,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos,
D-Calif.
   Lawmakers have scrupulously avoided any criticism of President
Bush's handling of the Persian Gulf crisis, which has been publicly
popular and sent Bush's approval ratings to near-record highs. But
Hamilton was clearly annoyed by the administration's efforts to
defend its prior policy of hoping to moderate Saddam's behavior by
treating Iraq gently.
   He implied that Kelly was seeking to recast or escape
responsibility for his earlier testimony, in which he suggested
Congress had misread Saddam's intentions and the prospects for an
improvement in U.S.-Iraqi relations.
   In response, Kelly cited Bush's acknowledgement Monday that the
previous policy ``didn't produce results.''
   ``And was wrong?'' asked Hamilton.
   ``It did not succeed,'' Kelly answered.
   ``That's for sure,'' Hamilton said.
   Only Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., came to Kelly's defense.
``It is unhelpful to imply blame'' on the part of the United States
for Saddam's unprovoked aggression, he said, or to suggest that
Glaspie somehow ``gave Saddam Hussein the green light'' to invade.
   Smith noted that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was fooled,
too, about Saddam's intentions in the days before the invasion.
   ``It would be most unfair if this develops into a blame America
situation,'' he said. ``It would be most hurtful to the
sustainability of this policy.''
   Under questioning by Hamilton, Kelly said the United States is
committed to defend not only Saudi Arabia and Kuwait but other gulf
states helping in the crisis. He agreed when Hamilton specifically
named Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.
   Also at the hearing, friends of Israel attacked the
administration's proposed $20 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia,
saying the package isn't justified by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``Both its magnitude and its premises are outrageous,'' said
Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif. ``It has little or nothing to do with
anybody's legitimate defense needs.''
   Levine said the proposed sale, the largest ever, would alter the
military balance in the Middle East and deprive Israel of the
``qualitative edge'' in defense capability it has traditionally
been guaranteed by the United States.
   But Henry S. Rowen, the assistant secretary of defense for
international security affairs, said U.S. officials are discussing
with Israel a new security package of its own, and said the Saudi
weapons would not erode Israel's advantage.
   In response to another question, Kelly said he expects the
crisis will have ``a cathartic effect'' in the gulf, encouraging
``real changes'' in the way states in the region are governed,
including increased political openness and pluralism.
   In other matters Tuesday:
   -The Pentagon said Iraqi troop strength in and near Kuwait has
risen to 360,000 while some tanks and artillery have been pulled
back from the front lines near Saudi Arabia. The Pentagon's last
estimate two weeks ago was that there were 265,000 Iraqi troops and
2,200 tanks in Kuwait and nearby sections of Iraq.
   -Defense Secretary Dick Cheney consulted with the White House
about his selection of a Vietnam veteran and former Thunderbird
pilot, Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, to replace the general he fired as
Air Force chief of staff. Gen. Mike Dugan was fired Monday after
revealing secret U.S. plans that contemplate bombing Iraq and
personally targeting Saddam.

   The hunt by the Bush administration and
congressional leaders for a budget compromise is lurching into an
uncertain direction as the two sides, their eyes on the calendar,
search for a compromise.
   The top five congressional leaders planned to meet again today
with White House Chief of Staff John Sununu and two other
high-ranking administration officials. They are seeking a package
to cut the federal deficit by $50 billion next year and $450
billion more by 1995.
   The group met in the Capitol on Tuesday, a day after the
10-day-old negotiations at Andrews Air Force Base in nearby
Maryland ended in stalemate.
   ``It was reaffirmed on all sides that it continues to be our
strong desire to reach agreement as soon as possible,'' said House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   Gephardt and White House budget director Richard Darman also
planned to meet separately in the hope of making a breakthrough.
   The effort continued as Oct. 1, the first day of fiscal 1991,
rapidly approached. If no deal is in place by that day, the
Gramm-Rudman law will chop about $100 billion out of the $1.2
trillion federal budget, a cut that all agree would stagger
government operations.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., began gathering
signatures among his colleagues on a letter promising support for
President Bush if he vetoes a bill rolling back the Gramm-Rudman
cuts, should one arise.
   But some officials who asked to not be identified - including
Republicans - said that because the effect of the Gramm-Rudman cuts
would be so severe, it was not clear that Dole would get 34
signatures, the minimum amount of votes needed to sustain a veto.
   Democrats said the Andrews talks failed because of Bush's demand
to cut the capital gains tax rate. Republicans say the reduction
would stimulate the economy, while Democrats contend only the rich
would benefit because they own most of the property affected by the
tax.
   Republicans also blamed the impasse on Democratic efforts to
raise taxes too high and to protect domestic programs from spending
cuts.

   Victims of white-collar fraud would find it
harder to win court damages under a bill approved by a House
committee, but sponsors say current law has gotten out of hand and
urgently needs reform.
   The accounting industry and others being named in racketeering
suits have been pushing for legislation to tighten the law. The
bill was approved Tuesday by the House Judiciary Committee on a
voice vote.
   Critics said the measure would prevent victims from collecting
damages from white-collar criminals. Sponsors said the
anti-racketeering law was meant for use against organized crime,
not bankers and accountants as it's being used.
   Businessmen have been vulnerable to ``horrible damages when
there hasn't been anything close to proof of criminal conduct,''
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., told the committee.
   The Capitol Hill watchdog group Public Citizen issued a
statement saying the bill ``provides a bailout for the accountants,
law firms, real estate appraisers and investment bankers whose
participation was essential to the success of the S&amp;L scams.''
   Quick floor action is expected, with Congress set to leave
Washington for the campaign trail in a matter of weeks.
   The measure would make major changes in the Racketeer Influenced
Corrupt Organizations Act. It allows victims of white-collar crime
to collect triple damages if they can prove they have been harmed
by a pattern of fraud.
   Those who lost money in the collapse of Charles Keating Jr.'s
Lincoln Savings of Irvine, Calif., are seeking triple damages under
the law from several figures in the scandal, including accountants
who gave Keating a clean bill of financial health.
   Legislation that would make it more difficult to get triple
damages under the law already has been approved by the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
   In contrast, the House bill sets up strict standards that
lawsuits must meet. A lawsuit would be allowed only if it ``clearly
serves the public interest and provides appropriate deterrence
against the repetition of egregious criminal conduct.''
   The committee also adopted a provision to require those filing
suit to prove that the defendants were an ``integral'' part of
ongoing racketeering activity.
   But a number of lawmakers warned that could prove an escape
hatch for various minor figures who were not at the heart of
white-collar scandals but who still played a role.
   Rep. Craig Washington, D-Texas, said the provision would
``create a small loophole through which a crafty lawyer could drive
a large van of lawyers and accountants.''
   ``I don't agree with the gentleman,'' said Rep. William Hughes,
D-N.J., the chief sponsor of the amendment.
   Committee members also questioned the provision limiting
lawsuits to those involving ``ongoing'' fraud. ``We're going to
have trouble with the language,'' said Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.
``To me, ongoing means going on right now.''
   Rep. Romano Mazzoli, D-Ky., said that because of the amendment
the lawmakers might ``be inadvertently insulating people.'' But the
same amendment erased a provision of the bill that would have made
it retroactive and could have thrown a number of current lawsuits
out of court.

   The Syrian general's previous
campaigns were against Israelis and in the Lebanese maelstrom, but
he appeared happy enough to be lining up on the side of the
Americans.
   Because of the enemy, he said - Saddam Hussein.
   ``I hope he dies very soon,'' Gen. Mohammed Deeb Dhaher said of
the Iraqi leader during a visit Tuesday by journalists to his camp
in the northern Saudi desert.
   ``I am an Arab officer,'' said Dhaher, a veteran of the 1973
Golan Heights battles against Israel. ``I am ready to go any time
and stand with other Arab countries.''
   The Syrian fighters under his command are among a group of small
Arab units who form the front line of the multinational force
arrayed against Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. They include Saudi, Egyptian
and Kuwaiti troops.
   Dhaher's forces include 1,200 to 1,500 commandos who have seen
fighting in Lebanon. He described them as a buffer between the
brother Arab nations of Iraq and Saudi Arabia.
   ``The Syrians are here for the defense of Saudi Arabia but if
they have to go for offense they will be ready,'' he said.
   Like the Egyptians, now 2,000 strong, they are awaiting the
arrival of reinforcements.
   But their deployment appears more a political statement than a
military threat. The bulk of the foreign troops in Saudia Arabia
are American, but most of the U.S. troops are based about 30 miles
behind the Arab forces, which are about 40 miles from the Kuwaiti
border.
   One of Dhaher's men, Ramzi Salim, said the Syrians would have no
problem fighting alongside Americans if hostilities break out.
   ``Everyone in the world is against Saddam Hussein,'' Salim said.
``Kuwait will be Kuwait again.''
   The Arab field commanders spoke of working together, for now to
defend Saudi Arabia, perhaps soon to push Saddam's army from
Kuwait.
   It is the first time Syria has been aligned with Washington in
any Middle East conflict. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
visited Damascus last week and President Hafez Assad promised to
bolster his forces in Saudi Arabia.
   Prior to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Assad figured more
prominently on the U.S. list of troublemakers in the Middle East
than did Saddam. Syria is one of seven nations on a State
Department list of terrorism sponsors.
   But Assad's emnity for Saddam is strong - they lead rival wings
of the Baath Party - and with diminishing Soviet support, he is
seeking to improve his ties with the West.
   The Egyptian commander, Col. Abdul Rahim Mohammed Said, played
down suggestions the Arabs forces might have trouble fighting
together, either because of political differences of different
military training.
   ``We have no problems with the Arab forces,'' he said. ``Most
important is, we speak one language, which is the Arabic language,
which will make it much easier.''
   During Tuesday's visit, arranged by the Saudi government, the
Arab troops in the desert camps to the northeast of Hafr al Batin
spent much of the day dealing with a swirling wind that stirred up
sand clouds, at times so thick they hid the tents and equipment.
   At the Kuwaiti camp, men from the army that was quickly defeated
in the Iraqi invasion spoke of leading the charge home, although
only about a third of the pre-invasion Kuwaiti army of 20,000
remains.
   ``We are willing to go for offense and get our country back but
we are waiting for orders,'' says the Kuwaiti commander, Col.
Ibrahim Mohammed.
   As the television cameras rolled, a handful of Kuwaitis rode
atop an armored personnel carrier, flashing the ``V'' for victory
sign.

   New Jersey and Indiana lawmakers are at odds
over a Senate-approved measure that would allow states to close
their borders to other states' garbage to protect shrinking
landfill capacity.
   Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., said his bill would give ``every state
the right to determine its own destiny'' in managing trash. But New
Jersey Democratic Sens. Frank Lautenberg and Bill Bradley contend
the bill could slam the door on states unprepared for critical
landfill shortages.
   The Senate approved the measure Tuesday on a 68-31 vote.
Lautenberg and Bradley say they will try to persuade a House-Senate
conference committee to kill the bill.
   New Jersey is the largest exporter of solid waste to Indiana
landfills, which Coats said are eight to 10 years from reaching
their capacity. Indiana, he said, is afraid of being overrun by
trash.
   But New Jersey says it's also in danger of being overwhelmed by
garbage.
   Coats' proposal, offered as an amendment to the District of
Columbia appropriations bill, would let states block garbage
imports as long as they had a 20-year solid waste plan in place.
   Lautenberg and Bradley charged the measure would block
development of a comprehensive national solid waste policy by
pitting state against state.
   ``What goes around, comes around,'' Bradley said several times
on the Senate floor, as he warned colleagues that 37 states and the
District of Columbia export garbage and could find themselves in
New Jersey's position.
   The New Jersey senators told reporters the garbage measure could
be stripped from the district appropriations bill because the House
has no similar garbage provision in its version.
   The district appropriations bill is also in danger of a
presidential veto because it contains abortion funding language
that led to two vetoes last year.
   If the garbage provision ``is knocked out, we'll be back next
year,'' Coats said. ``At minimum, we have established a 2-to-1
majority to do something about this problem.''
   Lautenberg accused Coats of playing election-year politics with
the garbage issue by running television campaign ads that depict a
caricature of a New Jersey man dumping garbage on a Hoosier stoop.
   Coats was among those accusing New Jersey of not doing enough to
control its own waste crisis.
   ``New Jersey has to solve its problem in a sensible,
non-polluting way,'' Lautenberg said, acknowledging the state's
position had few adherents outside the Northeast.
   ``We knew we were on the less-popular side of the issue,'' he
said.
   But Lautenberg argued that passage would let states impose
``unlimited, punitive fees on out-of-state garbage'' without
Environmental Protection Agency review.
   ``A state writes its own ticket,'' he said.
   Lautenberg also warned the bill ``would force locked-out states
to take desperate steps ... that may mean a rush to incinerators''
or illegal dumping.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Begin Excavating Santa Fe City Square</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Remnants of an ancient Indian pueblo or
centuries-old ox deposits? Nobody's sure what lies beneath Santa Fe
Plaza in the heart of the nation's oldest capital city, but
archaeologists hope to find out.
   Watched by Plaza regulars, skateboard riders and tourists, an
archaeological team on Tuesday began the first of several
exploratory digs on the verdant square, which is surrounded by
museums, boutiques and gift shops.
   Within hours, volunteer diggers were unearthing interesting
shards of pottery, including a button-size chip of blue and white
Mexican majolica clay used in pottery since the 17th century.
   Excavation leader David Snow said diggers could find older Plaza
levels, Indian artifacts and evidence of frontier life.
   ``We've already learned something in the top six inches,'' he
said.
   Santa Fe was the seat of frontier government and a distant
outpost of civilization for most of its 380-year history.
   The Plaza was once a terminus for exploration, trade and
immigration routes, including the Camino Real from Mexico City and
the Santa Fe Trail from the Mississippi River. It was used for
troop encampments, trade markets, for holding oxen from Missouri
wagon trains and for growing corn and alfalfa.
   ``It was the center of the frontier for at least three
nations,'' Snow said. ``This was the focus of the frontier up until
the railroad came'' in the early 1880s.
   The Plaza is anchored by the Palace of the Governors, the seat
of government built by the Spanish starting about 1610. Pueblo
Indians threw out the Spanish in 1680, and it is thought that some
Indian dwellings and a kiva, a large room often used for religious
purposes, were built on the Plaza.
   The Spaniards returned in 1692. The palace housed Spanish,
Mexican and U.S. territorial governors until the late 1800s.
   These days, the only conquistadors and mountain men around these
days are re-enacting history in the palace, now a museum. Indians
sell jewelry to tourists under its portal. Youngsters loiter in the
square, riding skateboards and playing games.
   Archaeologists will work for about a month on the first phase of
the excavation and are restricted to selected areas totaling 10
square meters.
   If they uncover enough promising artifacts, and if the City
Council approves, a second dig will begin next year under San
Francisco Street, the street across from the palace that leads to
St. Francis Cathedral.
   If that pans out, a major Plaza dig would be conducted in 1992.
The Plaza is a historically designated site protected by city
ordinances, and the surrounding buildings are unlikely to be
threatened by any excavation.

<HEAD>Marines Take `Third World City' That No One Called Kuwait</HEAD>

   No signs were in Arabic, but
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait City couldn't have been far from their
thoughts as Marine assault teams stormed and captured a mock
``Third World city'' and rescued its civilian refugees.
   The assault was fast and furious. But with only light ``enemy''
resistance, Tuesday's training exercise was far from a realistic
warmup for Kuwait.
   ``Iraq would be a hell of a lot different - a lot scarier,''
said Sgt. Keith Cawthorn, a member of the 1st Battalion, 8th Marine
Regiment that took the mock city.
   Standing aside his light-armored vehicle, he quickly adds: ``But
we could do it.''
   Cawthorn and several hundred of his compatriots showed some of
the skills they would need in Kuwait.
   Amid a deafening roar of fire from rifles and machine guns
loaded with blanks, a camouflaged Marine partly hidden in a smoke
screen shinnied up a downspout to the roof of ``city hall.'' He
tossed a rope to the ground and several others quickly joined him.
   Within minutes, they had secured the building's top floor,
hoisted extra weapons up by rope, leaped through a lower floor
window from ropes attached to the roof and rushed a group of
civilian refugees out the front door to waiting rescue vehicles.
   ``All's clear,'' a voice called.
   Operating from a previously secured hotel in the center of the
city, other Marines quickly overcame the enemy stronghold in a
residential area. A Cobra attack helicopter strafed the nearby
school complex and seconds later a half dozen Marines dropped from
a CH-46 helicopter by rope to the roof of the school gym.
   Once the school was under Marine control more civilians ran from
the rear of the gym to an adjacent soccer stadium. There they met
incoming helicopters that whisked the group to safety as amphibious
assault vehicles ringed the grassy field.
   The exercise, marking the opening of a new Marine Corps urban
warfare training center, was not designed to simulate an attack on
Kuwait City, said Brig. Gen. Michael Downs, commander of the Camp
Lejeune training base on the Carolina coast.
   Downs and other Marine officers showed in their public comments,
however, that Operation Desert Shield - in which about one-third of
the 150,000 U.S. forces deployed to the Persian Gulf area are
Marines - was not far from anyone's mind.
   ``While our attention these last weeks has been on the sands of
Saudi Arabia, many of us remember Vietnam ... we remember Beirut
and Panama,'' Downs told a group of Pentagon officials,
congressional staffers and journalists observing the exercise. ``We
must be capable of fighting in all these environments.''
   President Bush sent the Marines, Navy, Air Force and Army to
Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf area to defend against a possible
Iraqi attack on the Saudi oil fields. But he has not ruled out an
offensive strike on Kuwait to force Iraq out.
   Downs said the artificial city, carved out of 17 acres of pine
forest at a cost of $7.9 million, was not designed specifically to
train for operations in the Middle East. But others acknowledged
that some Camp Lejeune Marines saw a link to Kuwait.
   Capt. Greg Sumner, a company commander, said some of his men
already had dubbed the mock town Kuwait City, even though its
street signs read ``Mayberry Drive'' and ``Weaver Way'' and a
church with steeple stands at one end of town.
   Even Gen. Al Gray, commandant of the Marines, made a veiled
reference to the Persian Gulf crisis in brief remarks at a
ribbon-cutting ceremony at Camp Lejeune on Tuesday.
   ``We would like to avoid the kind of combat and conflict you're
going to see,'' he told a group of visitors who accompanied him to
the training exercise. ``But you can't always do that ...
particularly in many of the less developed parts of the world
where'' a single city ``is really what controls'' the country.

   ON THE PERSIAN GULF, Sau- Signs in English and
Arabic proclaim this a future resort area. The living conditions
may still be a tad rustic, but even the 265th's cynics admit it's
an improvement over the dusty heat dia Arabia (AP) of their last quarters.
   At first glance it seems like a Club Med vacation. The 265th
Quartermaster Detachment is camped on a beach, a few hundred yards
from the azure blue of the Persian Gulf. A steady breeze off the
water loosens the sun's grip.
   There are beachside showers and latrines. The tents even have
electricity produced by the steady thump of a generator.
   ``It's a place that's all right to visit,'' said Spc. Henry
Harris. ``But it's not a place to stay.''
   More significant than the accommodations is that the 14 members
of the South Carolina National Guard are about to do what they've
been sent to do: make drinking water.
   This beach encampment has two Reverse Osmosis Water Purification
Uniand filters
that uses up to 800 pounds per square inch of high pressure to
strain impurities from the water.
   Newcomb pointed to salt-encrusted, high pressure hoses chained
to the units. ``If it comes loose and catches you, it can cut you
in half,'' he warned.
   Under instructions of Newcomb and the other teachers, the 265th
started the chunky-sounding diesel-powered pumps. Safety valves
whistled as the water pushed air from the lines. A leak spouted
from one of the filter units and was quickly plugged.
   Newcomb tapped a line, tasted the water, then poured some into a
test meter. It showed the salinity level half that of the bottled
water the troops have been drinking.
   Spcs. Rooker, Harris, Young and Deloach wrestled the hose
carrying the fresh water into a feeder network that filled one of
the storage bags. They were drenched in the initiation.
   A huge storage bag, a 75-foot-long, 5-foot-tall water mattress,
undulated as the water poured in at 100 gallons a minute. At the
other end a spigot was opened and Harris put a handful to his
mouth.
   It was warm and clear, with the slight taste of a swimming pool.
   ``A little high on the chlorine,'' he judged. ``But it's fine.''

<HEAD>Governor Proposes 50-Mile Statewide Drilling Buffer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil and natural gas drilling should
be banned within 50 miles of Florida's shores including the
Panhandle, Gov. Bob Martinez said as he campaigned for re-election
in the region.
   The governor's proposal Tuesday would tighten existing drilling
limits that include a 30-mile buffer in the Gulf of Mexico from
Naples to Cape San Blas in southwest Florida. That agreement leaves
the western Panhandle unprotected outside state-controlled waters,
which extend 10 miles into the gulf.
   ``In essence we want a safety collar around the state of Florida
from any possible drilling, also any spilling that can occur as a
result of the drilling,'' Martinez said.
   Martinez's Democratic opponent, former Sen. Lawton Chiles,
``would support what Martinez is proposing, but he would go farther
than that,'' said Julie Fletcher, a spokeswoman for the Chiles
campaign in Tallahassee.
   She said Chiles would oppose any drilling off Florida's shores
regardless how far it may be off the shore. She also questioned
whether the governor's proposal is merely for political
expediency.

   Democratic Sen. Max Baucus' opposition to
the strategic defense initiative leaves the nation vulnerable to
missiles from enemy nations, says Republican U.S. Senate candidate
Allen Kolstad.
   Kolstad, the lieutenant governor, said Tuesday that Baucus
repeatedly has voted against the SDI program.
   Kolstad praised the program supported by the Reagan and Bush
administrations. It is ``technologically feasible, strategically
necessary and morally imperative,'' said Kolstad.
   Baucus responded by saying the nation's over-reliance on
expensive nuclear and Star Wars defense programs has hampered the
U.S. buildup in the Persian Gulf during the last six weeks.
   He said he supports funding for the kind of conventional weapons
that would be needed in a Mideast conflict - tanks, attack
helicopters, fighter planes and missiles. Money should be shifted
from the more costly and controversial military programs to bolster
other weapons systems, he said.
   Baucus said he voted against the defense spending measures cited
by Kolstad because they spent too much on Star Wars and nuclear
weapons.

Orders are to keep their ammo clips in their pockets. No accidents

   A ``Reporter's Notebook,'' story is a used in this profession to
clear the interesting odds and ends from your notebook at the end
of a story. It's a form of housecleaning.
   But it's hard to do after an intense two weeks with 14
individuals known collectively as the 265th Quartermaster
Detachment.
   What should you leave in and what should you leave out when
summing up an experience that started each day at 5:30 a.m. and
went strong past sunset? How can you remain detached? How do you
reach closure?
   Each member of the 265th is worthy of his own story: Hullie
Cohen's calm competence, Bobby Youman's interest in learning, Ed
Simmons' quiet anger. The group dynamics could make six sociology
case studies: Sgt. Jackson's leadership style and his relationship
with his men; Mark Rooker, 20 years old and white, and his place in
an otherwise all-black unit.
   But there is no room here even to begin. And now it's time to
leave.
   The story ends for me because I have to get on a plane for home.
It goes on for these men who will spend up to six months away from
their families.
   These are men who are very small cogs in the very large wheel of
history. But they are all people of depth and dignity.
   I will miss them more than I want to consider now, as I say
goodbye.

   For two years, the powdery soil on David
Lang's farm refused to yield a crop.
   This year, he finally got rain and about 1,500 acres of golden
wheat. But he's stuck with the wheat.
   A world wheat glut totaling more than 21.6 billion bushels is
holding down prices, experts say. The U.S. wheat crop alone is
expected to total a record 2.76 billion bushels, up 35 percent from
last year.
   ``There's a wheat war going on,'' said Neal Fisher, director of
the North Dakota Wheat Commission. ``Canadians sold wheat to China
about two weeks ago for something around $2.50 a bushel. The
European Community is selling it for $2.05.''
   North Dakota wheat farmers like Lang are getting about $2.20 a
bushel, at least $1 less than last year and the lowest they've seen
in at least five years. Farmers say the costs of producing a bushel
are at least three times that much.
   ``You have to pay $1.35 to $1.40 for a gallon of gasoline just
to harvest that crop,'' said Lang, 44, who farms 3,000 acres with
his father about 20 miles from Bismarck.
   Government subsidies help offset production costs, but farmers
say they also are being squeezed this year by energy prices, which
have risen sharply since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``We will probably lose more farmers this year than any year
previous,'' said Gov. George Sinner. ``The long-range future is so
bleak to many farmers that they are simply saying, `The hell with
it.' ''
   Wheat growers say the embargo against Iraq is having little
effect on the market because American wheat sales to Iraq had
already virtually dried up this year.
   Farm leaders are asking the U.S. Agriculture Department to help
lift wheat prices by keeping more grain in reserve, offering bigger
loans to farmers and paying more federal export bonuses to increase
sales.
   But Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has said that if
American farmers plant less or put more in storage, foreign
competitors will only plant more. His department already has
increased export bonuses at the risk of driving the market lower,
he said.
   ``We're doing all we can to help move U.S. wheat in the
marketplace in a sensible way,'' Yeutter said in a letter to Rep.
Dan Glickman, D-Kansas.
   For some farmers, it's a hard blow after two years in which
nothing would grow. Lang said he is leaning on strong livestock
prices. He can sell some of his 150 cattle, and he'll get a USDA
loan on his wheat to help pay bills.
   Under the loan program, farmers can pay back the money at the
end of nine months and sell their wheat for a higher price, or the
government gets the grain. But farmers also say the loan rate, less
than $2 per bushel, is too low.
   North Dakota expects to harvest a record 275 million bushels of
spring wheat and 104 million bushels of durum, a wheat variety used
in pasta.
   Lang said he's not asking for wheat at $5 per bushel when $3.50
would do. All he wants is a stable farm program.
   ``Urban people have got to realize where food comes from,'' he
said. ``If we're not out here producing it, one of these years
they're going to go hungry.''

   President Bush is using the Persian Gulf
crisis to beef up campaign speeches, saying there's no reason
politics should stop just because of the turmoil abroad.
   Bush told a Republican fund-raising dinner Tuesday night that
``we will not allow our political life to he held hostage to a
crisis.''
   The president today was heading to San Francisco for more GOP
politicking in California's tight governor's race before returning
to Washington tonight.
   Bush predicted the armed forces he's sent to the Gulf region,
now numbering some 150,000, will vote by absentee ballots and said
their compatriots at home should do no less on election day.
   ``If our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines can find the time
to vote under such difficult circumstances, surely those of us at
home will do our civic duty as well,'' he told a dinner fund-raiser
for the gubernatorial campaign of Sen. Pete Wilson.
   He also reiterated that his Persian Gulf strategy includes
driving Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from occupied Kuwait and
restoring the deposed Kuwaiti emir to power. He said he wants ``to
create a new partnership of nations, a new world order - freer from
the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, more
secure in the quest for peace.''
   ``On matters like these we are called upon to put country before
self, and patriotism before party,'' Bush said. ``So it's good that
politics now are stopping at the water's edge, but that still
leaves a lot of America in between.''
   The president issued a virtual call to political arms on the
home front.
   ``We will vigorously campaign right up to the November
election,'' Bush pledged. ``For those of us at home, we can serve
our country by being the best candidates, the best citizens and,
yes, the best Republicans and Democrats we can be.''
   Bush earlier visited Denver on his two-day swing, the type of
campaign trip he likely will take each week until the November
election. He's expected to make another visit to California, where
the governor's race is the GOP's top national priority.
   Bush's schedule today included a breakfast fund-raiser for the
state party and a San Francisco lunch for Wilson's campaign. The
Wilson forces hope to raise between $1.5 million and $2 million at
the $1,000-a-person events.
   Bush was to highlight Wilson's environmental record.
   Courting the environmental vote has been a hot issue in the
gubernatorial race between Wilson and former San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic nominee.
   Wilson has ardently supported coastal protection, bucking both
the Reagan and Bush White Houses, and championed forestry and river
protection as well. He has won the backing of environmental groups
that traditionally would be expected to back the Democratic
nominee.
   Wilson won the endorsement of Friends of the River and the
Western River Guides Association.
   Other environmental groups, including the Sierra Club and League
of Conservation Voters, have yet to announce an endorsement.
   Wilson's campaign anticipates spending more than $15 million in
his bid to defeat Feinstein, whose fund-raising goal is $10
million. Both are spending heavily on dueling TV commercials.
   Bush, in his comments at a $1,000-a-ticket audience Tuesday
night at the downtown Bonaventure Hotel, dovetailed his remarks to
go with Wilson's current tough-on-crime theme.
   He noted that Wilson's grandfather was a Chicago police
detective who was gunned down by cocaine dealers.
   Bush praised Wilson for supporting his crime package, which has
been mostly rewritten by the Democratic controlled Congress.
   ``He wants to govern a California where women need no longer
fear the night because drug dealers and criminals will fear the
law,'' Bush said. ``And he would start by extending capital
punishment in California to major drug traffickers, the same as my
proposal before Congress.''

<HEAD>Manufacturer Says Seat Buckle Needs Replacement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manufacturer of Evenflo child safety seats
is recalling the buckle assembly on more than 3 million seats
because it doesn't meet government safety standards.
   ``At times the buckle can look buckled and feel buckled even
when it is not completely latched,'' said Jerry Curry,
administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
   ``If the buckle is not completely latched, it can release during
a crash and substantially reduce the protection provided to the
child,'' he said.
   The recall involves more than 3 million child safety seats
manufactured between April 15, 1985, and April 22, 1990. Each seat
has a black buckle housing and a red push-button release.
   People who own the seats should not return them to the retailer,
Evenflo said. They should request a repair kit, which includes a
replacement buckle assembly that is easily installed.
   Consumers should continue using the seat until the replacement
arrives but should make certain the buckle is engaged by pulling
down firmly on the crotch strap, the company said.
   The recall involves infant-only car seats with the model numbers
441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 448, 456, 458, 201 and 202;
convertible infant-toddler seats with model numbers 401, 402, 403,
404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 411, 412, 414, 415, 416, 417, 453,
454, 221, 223, and 228; and booster seats with model numbers 470,
471, and 242.
   To obtain a repair kit, consumers should call 1-800-837-8926 or
write to Evenflo at 1801 Commerce Drive, Piqua, Ohio, 45356.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Software Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Makers of computer software could bar video
stores and others from renting their software to customers as the
result of legislation approved by the House Judiciary Committee.
   Manufacturers have complained that the rentals of video games
are cutting into sales. The games often cost between $40 and $50.
   The bill sponsored by Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., is similar to a
law already passed by Congress under which record manufacturers are
allowed to bar rentals.
   The idea behind the bill is that it's easy to copy both records
and computer software stored on floppy discs. The rentals are
therefore considered to undercut the copyrights held by the
manufacturers.
   Under the bill, manufacturers would have the option of allowing
rentals or barring them. In the case of records, most makers don't
allow rentals.
   The bill applies to a wide range of computer software in
addition to video games, but the rental of games by stores that
specialize mainly in renting movies is the main focus of the issue.

   Standing before the glass-enclosed original of
the U.S. Constitution, 27 foreigners took the oath as American
citizens this week to begin the annual ``Constitution Week''
celebration of the signing of the nation's charter 203 years ago.
   The former citizens of 27 countries, from Peru and the
Philippines to Ireland and Africa's Ivory Coast, were sworn in
Monday by U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene in the rotunda of
the National Archives, where the original Constitution, the
Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights are on display.
   Constitution Week, an annual event established by Congress in
1956, is being coordinated this year by the Commission on the
Bicentennial of the United States Constitution, which is sponsoring
a five-year celebration of the beginnings of the U.S. government.
   The commission began in 1987 with a commemoration of the signing
of the Constitution and will end next year with a celebration of
the 200th anniversary of the adoption of the Bill of Rights.
   This year, the commission is focusing public attention on the
convening of the Supreme Court in 1790 and the formation of the
federal judiciary.

<TEXT>
   Salvadoran government and guerrilla
negotiators ended six days of talks toward ending a decade-long
civil war without success, and both sides said they expected an
escalation in the fighting.
   The parley that ended Tuesday was the fifth session of
U.N.-mediated talks that began in May between representatives of
the rightist government of President Alfredo Cristiani and the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   The two sides agreed to meet again in Mexico before November 4.
   The top item on the agenda was the future role of the armed
forces.
   The guerrillas demanded a purge of human rights abusers and
corrupt officers, as well as measures to ensure an end to decades
of impunity for military men who commit crimes.
   International human rights monitoring agencies accuse the armed
forces of involvement in the murders of as many as 30,000 suspected
government opponents during the past decade.
   Even so, not a single officer has been tried for a crime
characterized by the politically motivated abuse of human rights.
   Rights groups also blame the FMLN for summary executions of
suspected opponents, but in far fewer numbers.
   The government says it is willing to reform the military, but
its proposal calls for the armed forces to do their own reforming,
which the guerrillas say would result in only cosmetic changes.
   The FMLN contends purge and reorganization of the armed forces
should lead to eventual demilitarization of Salvadoran society.
Both the guerrilla and government armies would disappear, giving
way to a civilian-run police force, according to the rebel
proposal.
   Both sides accused each other of biding time to gain tactical
battlefield advantages.
   The civil war, which began in late 1979, has left an estimated
72,000 people dead. Death squads linked to the military and
right-wing extremists are blamed for a large percentage of the
deaths.
   Since 1980, the United States has provided more than $4 billion
in economic and military aid to bolster a succession of Salvadoran
governments.
   But Congress, increasingly exasperated with the military
standoff and military atrocities - like the murder of six prominent
Jesuit priests in November - is expected to significantly pare
military aid this fall.
   Rebel commanders for weeks have said a stalemate at the
negotiating table could provoke a major insurgent offensive. The
launched its biggest offensive of the war last fall.
   Col. Mauricio Vargas, agovernment negotiator, said the rebel
predictions of an imminent offensive amount to ``blackmail.''

   TV's old reliables, coupled with movies,
sports and home videos, left many of the fall season's vaunted new
shows in the ratings cellar.
   ``60 Minutes'' was the most-watched show of the past week, the
A.C. Nielsen Co. said Tuesday. The season opener featured a segment
on the slaying of former Pentagon scientist Gerald Bull, who
developed advanced Supergun weaponry for Iraq.
   The Sunday news magazine, which has been in and out of the No. 1
spot for CBS in recent weeks with special highlights of the Middle
East crisis, received an 18.4 rating. Each rating point represents
931,000 homes.
   ABC's ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' came in second with its
fall premiere. An ABC special on the making of the show tied for
seventh. ``Home Videos'' was a hit last season with its fare of
videotaped pratfalls and people in silly situations.
   Meanwhile, the season opener of a new ``Home Videos'' spinoff
called ``America's Funniest People'' landed in a two-way tie for
fifth place with a fresh installment of CBS' venerable ``Murder,
She Wrote.''
   In the overall network ratings, pulled out of its usual No. 2
spot and was the top-rated network with an 11.9 average. NBC had a
10.9 and CBS a 10.6.
   New fall shows whose premieres were lackluster included CBS'
raunchy ``ncle Buck,'' which was No. 35; ABC's ``Gabriel's Fire,''
starring James Earl Jones, which was 51st, and NBC's ``Law and
Order,'' which ranked 41st.
   Monday night's prime-time, National Football League showdown
between the San Francisco 49ers and the New Orleans Saints was No.
3, ranking just ahead of the last summer rerun of NBC's ``Cheers,''
which begins its new season Thursday.
   The NBC Monday Night Movie, ``Joshua's Heart,'' and ABC's Sunday
Night Movie, ``Sudden Impact,'' tied for ninth.
   ABC and Peter Jennings won the nightly news battle again with a
10.1 average rating. CBS and Dan Rather placed a distant second
with 8.7 and NBC and Tom Brokaw were third with 8.3.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``60
Minutes,'' CBS, 18.4; ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC,
18.2; ``NFL Monday Night Football,'' ABC, 18; ``Cheers,'' NBC,
16.7; ``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS, and ``America's Funniest
People,'' ABC (tie) 16.4; ``America's Funniest Home Videos: Inside
Look,'' and the season opener of ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,'' (tie)
ABC, 15.8; ``NBC Monday Night Movie'' and ``ABC Sunday Night
Movie'' (tie), 15.6.

<HEAD>NASA Engineers Plan Exhaustive Search for Fuel Leaks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA says it may have caused the
leaks plaguing Columbia when it took apart the engine compartment
after the shuttle's last flight in January to remove polishing grit
that got inside.
   ``Someplace we didn't get a seal back on right or something,''
Henry Pohl, director of engineering at Johnson Space Center, said
Tuesday.
   Frustrated engineers planned as early as today an exhaustive
search of the cramped engine compartment for the pinhole or cracks
from which hydrogen is escaping.
   Insulation probably will have to be removed from the
compartment, a time-consuming job that ``can always run the risk of
creating another problem,'' Pohl said.
   NASA also plans to conduct a fueling test on Columbia no earlier
than Sunday, with TV cameras mounted inside the engine compartment.
   Columbia's launch along with the $150 million Astro observatory
was scrubbd because of a hydrogen leak during fueling Monday
night, the fourth postponement since May. Hydrogen leaks caused all
but one of the postponements.
   NASA said it is forming an investigative team to look into the
leaks.
   The beleaguered space agency has not launched a shuttle since
April. Discovery is scheduled next for launch, around Oct. 8, and
Columbia will not fly until at least November.
   If Discovery does not lift off with the Ulysses satellite by
Oct. 23, the $750 million mission will have to wait until late 1991
when Earth, the sun and Jupiter are back in the proper alignment.
   Officials have not decided yet whether to perform a fueling test
on Discovery, the only shuttle in the three-vehicle fleet in which
hydrogen leaks have not been found. About five days are needed for
such a test.
   Workers took apart Columbia's engine compartment after the
January launch in a search for contamination by a metal-polishing
abrasive, NASA said.
   ``I think we created a problem in that process,'' Pohl said.
   Pohl said the leaks are difficult to trace because they appear
only when the liquid hydrogen is at its coldest - minus 423 degrees
Fahrenheit.
   He said NASA should have checked Columbia more thoroughly after
hydrogen leaks first were detected in May.
   New fuel lines were installed between the orbiter and external
fuel tank before the second launch attempt, but hydrogen still
escaped into the engine compartment.
   Two leaky components in the compartment were replaced last week,
but that reduced the leakage there by only a third.

<HEAD>Butte County Approves Bailout to Avert Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Butte County accepted an $11.1 million
state bailout to avoid becoming the first county in the nation to
declare bankruptcy but warned that more danger lies ahead.
   The Board of Supervisors voted 3-2 Tuesday to accept Gov. George
Deukmejian's emergency offer of money to balance the county's $155
million budget.
   The tax base in mostly agricultural Butte in Northern California
is buckling under costly welfare and health care programs. In June,
voters rejected several tax increases.
   County officials said the bailout could allow for minimal wage
increases for county workers and for the hiring of more than a
dozen sheriff's deputies.
   The lack of revenue had forced the elimination of 23 jobs at the
sheriff's department, libary closings, longer delays at county
offices and fewer firefighters. Because of a four-year freeze on
salaries, 15 workers in Butte's welfare department qualify for
benefits themselves.
   However, county administrative officer Will Randolph said Butte
County faces a $25 million deficit in 1991.
   ``We're only putting off the inevitable,'' he said.
   The bailout agreement culminated weeks of acrimonious
negotiations between the county and the governor's office. The
supervisors had earlier said they could not accept less than $14.1
million to balance the budget.
   County authorities maintained they had no money to carry out
state-ordered programs. The governor suggested the county had
failed to manage its money properly.
   Even before the plan won approval, Butte County officials
cautioned that another budget shortage is looming and urged other
strapped counties to declare bankruptcy as a protest against the
state.
   ``We need to put together some kind of plan for the ABCs of
county survival,'' Supervisor Haskel McInturf said. ``I would call
it the Alliance of Bankrupt Counties.''
   Christina Cutshaw, spokeswoman for the County Supervisors
Association of California, said that ``there are at least 15
counties right behind Butte'' facing hardships aggravated by
state-mandated programs, annexations, incorporations and big
increases in jail operations.
   The governor agreed to defer more than $6.3 million owed the
state for fire protection, postpone the state's demand for payment
of a $2 million matching share for a new jail, and grant $1.15
million in cash.
   The bailout also calls for the county to raise $1.65 million by
increasing fees, including those involving property tax collections
and jail booking.
   Butte County ranks last among the state's 58 counties in the
amount spent per capita on local government. County officials say
85 percent of their budget is locked into existing programs
mandated by law, such as firefighting, welfare and health care for
the poor.

   Oklahoma has gone where no state has gone
before by slapping a limit on how long state lawmakers may serve.
   By a 2-1 margin, voters Tuesday approved a constitutional
amendment to put a lifetime cap of 12 years on legislative service.
The amendment takes effect Jan. 1; legislators now in office will
be allowed to serve 12 more years.
   In final, unofficial returns, ``yes'' votes outnumbered ``nos''
by 436,347 to 212,318, or 67 percent to 33 percent. It was
``democracy in action,'' said the proposal's chief backer, Tulsa
businessman Lloy Noble II.
   It is the first time a state has enacted such a limit. Colorado
and California will vote on limits Nov. 6, and similar legislation
has been introduced in Florida and New York, the National Council
of State Legislatures said.
   Noble argued that the limit was needed to keep legislators from
becoming entrenched in office and beholden to special interests
instead of the people.
   ``It is time to put limits on the professional politicians,'' he
said.
   Opponents contended that the ballot box already provided the
remedy. Only 16 members of the 48-member state Senate and 14 of the
101 House members had 12 or more years of service at the end of the
1990 legislative session.
   Sen. Ben Brown, D-Oklahoma City, complained that the amendment
took away basic rights of representation and turned more power over
to bureaucrats, who stay in office while elected officials come and
go.
   ``By voting the way they did, we have taken away one of the
basic rights the framers of the Constitution had provided and have
given it to the rich and powerful,'' he said.
   The amendment ``will tilt the government,'' he said. ``Everyone
complains about the bureaucracy, but this is going to put it more
in power. The Thomas Jeffersons who designed our system of
government meant for it to change gradually. This will cause it to
change rapidly.''
   Brown said he was not personally affected by the amendment. ``I
have served 10 years and, frankly, I don't know whether I'm even
going to seek re-election in two years,'' he said.
   From the outset, most observers had predicted the measure would
pass, particularly after voters approved an amendment in 1989 that
sharply limited the time the Legislature can remain in session.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Against Yen, Nikkei Falls Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed higher against the Japanese yen
in Tokyo Wednesday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
fell slightly.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost
158.65 points, or 0.66 percent, to close at 23,726.17.
   On Tuesday, the Nikkei index fell to 23,308.31, its lowest level
this year, before recovering to 23884.82, down 480.78 points, or
1.97 percent.
   The dollar closed Wednesday at 138.05, up 0.37 yen from
Tuesday's close. Trading ranged between 138.05 yen and 138.85 yen.
The U.S. currency started trading at 138.35 yen, up 0.67 yen from
Tuesday's close of 137.68 yen.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No, 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 8.560 percent, the same as
Tuesday, after trading at higher rates most of the day. The closing
price also was the same as Tuesday at 81.23 points.
   Bargain-hunting helped push up the index Wednesday morning,
despite a mood of pessimism and uncertainty, traders said. The
market rose steadily, but dipped down again toward the end of the
morning session.
   ``There is still a bearish feeling in general,'' said Toru Kanai
of New Japan Securities.
   The dollar's higher opening in Tokyo followed its increase in
New York, where it gained 1.20 yen, closing at 137.75 yen.
   The currency dropped against major European currencies after the
U.S. government reported its foreign trade deficit had climbed to
$9.33 billion in July from June's revised $5.34 billion. The
shortfall was nearly $2 billion greater than predicted.
   But the dollar fell against the yen only briefly, said a dealer
with the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``The dollar is strengthening against the yen, which is being
sold against the European currencies, especially the German mark,''
she said.
   She said, however, that the current strength of the dollar does
not mean it has reversed its recent downtrend, because the slowdown
in the U.S. economy remains a negative factor.
   ``Investors have been making technical adjustments because they
have overbought the yen against the dollar and European
currencies,'' she said.
   Other dealers said Tuesday's August U.S. consumer price report,
which showed a 0.8-percent increase, has lowered expectations of a
near-term fall in U.S. interest rates, helping the dollar's
recovery against the yen.
   Continuing weakness in the Japanese bond market also discouraged
yen-buying, they said.

<HEAD>Exiled Nobel Laureate Calls For Dismantling Of Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the kind of ascerbic prose that led to his
exile 16 years ago, Alexander Solzhenitsyn has used the pages of a
Soviet newspaper to call for the breakup of the Soviet Union and
establishment of a new Slavic state.
   ``The time of Communism is over,'' the 71-year-old man of
letters wrote from his home in Cavendish, Vt. ``But its concrete
structure hasn't collapsed yet. And let us not find ourselves under
its rubble instead of becoming free.''
   The commentary by the Nobel laureate and Soviet labor camp
survivor was the first piece he has written expressly for his
countrymen since his exile.
   ``How We Can Make Russia Comfortable'' took up the equivalent of
four full pages Tuesday of Komsomolskaya Pravda, the 22
million-circulation daily of the Communist Youth League.
   It also will appear in this week's Literaturnaya Gazeta, the
respected cultural weekly.
   The commentary represents yet another step in Solzhenitsyn's
official re-emergence in the Soviet Union.
   His long-banned books are being published in the nation that
expelled him in 1974 for treason, and last month President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev ordered his citizenship restored.
   However, Solzhenitsyn has rebuffed an invitation to return from
exile.
   ``We have to admit that the whole 20th century has been cruelly
lost by our country,'' he wrote in the commentary. ``The
achievements that we were shouting about are all imaginary. From a
flourishing state, we have been thrown back to a half-savage state.
We are bankrupt.''
   Solzhenitsyn chose to address the Russian people as secessionist
forces threaten to pull the Soviet Union apart and Parliament
grapples with proposals for scrapping Communism and embracing free
enterprise and private property.
   He calls for a return to private ownership but he also urges
rejection of capitalist exploitation and Western cultural
``garbage.''
   Solzhenitsyn advocates forming a ``Russian Union'' of the
republics of Russia, Byelorussia and the Ukraine. The other 12
Soviet republic have different cultures and should be allowed to
secede, he said.
   ``To keep the great empire dooms people to death.''
   Byelorussia and the Ukraine should not be tied to Russia by
force, but ``to divide the Ukraine from Russia means to cut through
millions of families. ... Brothers, don't let us have such cruel
separation,'' he wrote.
   At Tuesday's session of the Supreme Soviet parliament, many
legislators were seen reading in their seats the tract by the man
who described life in Soviet prison camps in books such as ``One
Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and ``The Gulag Archipelago.''
   While praising Gorbachev for setting a new course, Solzhenitsyn
lashed out against Communism and its legacy and cautioned that
anarchy could strike the Soviet Union as it emerges from decades of
totalitarianism.
   ``We shouldn't be trapped as our grandfathers and fathers of
1917 were. ... We shouldn't become a toy of tempting slogans and
eloquent speakers,'' he wrote.
   Solzhenitsyn praised the powerful presidency that has been
created by Gorbachev, saying it ``will be helpful for quite a long
period.''
   He wrote in favor of supporting and protecting small
enterprises, and argued against monopolies. He said collective
farms should be broken up and the land returned to private farmers.
   ``Private ownership of land ... guarantees long-term
improvement, rather than exhaustion, of the soil, and only with it
can we be sure that our agriculture will not move backward,''
Solzhenitsyn wrote.
   He cautioned, however, against letting foreigners buy Russian
land and forests.
   ``We shouldn't tempt Western capital with conditions beneficial
for it and humiliating for us. ... We will not be able to correct
the results of such a sale and we will turn into a colony,'' he
said.
   He also repeated his long-held abhorrence of materialism,
disdain for Western mass culture and belief that a democratic
society can exist under a powerful leader.
   Solzhenitsyn spoke against atheism, urged women to return to the
home and raise children, and called for textbooks to be revised or
thrown away.
   He said Russian youth, by emulating those in the West, were
being led in the direction of ``a barbaric copying of something
alien to us.''
   ``Our historic Iron Curtain perfectly protected our country from
everything good in the West, from civilian freedom, respect for
personality, the right of diverse personal activity. ...
   ``But this curtain didn't extend to the very bottom, and through
this opening, `pop-mass culture' and vulgar fashion has been
leaking,'' he said. ``And this garbage has been greedily accepted
by our deprived youth.''
   Solzhenitsyn said any royalties he earns from the article will
be given to victims of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident.
   ``We should get down on bended knee before Byelorussia and the
Ukraine for the Chernobyl tragedy, which happened because of the
fools of the Soviet system,'' he said. At least 31 died in the
disaster.

   Outspoken Boston University President John Silber shocked the
Massachusetts political establishment Tuesday by winning the
Democratic nomination for governor over former state Attorney
General Francis Bellotti.
   Silber, known for a series of controversial statements known as
``Silber shockers,'' will face former federal prosecutor William
Weld in the November general election.
   In Oklahoma, voters approved a first-in-the-nation
constitutional amendment limiting legislators to no more than 12
years in office. Runoff elections for Oklahoma governor went down
to the wire in both parties: Democrat David Walters and Republican
Bill Price each won by 51-to-49 percent margins.
   In both Massachusetts and Oklahoma, Tuesday's elections followed
unusually spirited primary campaigns. The incumbent governors -
Michael Dukakis in Massachusetts and Henry Bellmon in Oklahoma -
are both stepping down.
   The Massachusetts primary, which was waged against the backdrop
of a failing state economy and a governor who had tumbled from near
president to political ne'er-do-well, featured some unusually
barbed broadsides between Bellotti and Silber.
   Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy was listed on the Democratic ballot,
despite having dropped out of the race following an attempted
mutiny against Dukakis.
   Silber had been considered an underdog to Bellotti, who won the
endorsement at the June Democratic State Convention and has led in
political polls through most of the campaign. But Silber had
attracted increasing attention with his blunt, shoot-from-the-hip
style.
   With 75 percent of the precincts reporting, Silber had 389,408
votes, or 53 percent, to Bellotti's 323,727 votes, or 44 percent.
Murphy had 21,275 votes, or 3 percent.
   ``This has got to be a shocker by any definition,'' former U.S.
Sen. Paul Tsongas said as Silber sustained his lead.
   With 73 percent of the precincts reporting in the Republican
race, Weld had defeated House Minority Leader Stephen Pierce by
182,399 votes to 119,756 votes - 60 percent to 40 percent.
   ``Under the Democrats who have controlled our state government
for the past several years, Massachusetts has lost its way,'' Weld
declared to cheering supporters.
   It appeared that voters agreed. Attorney General James Shannon
and both the majority leader and speaker of the Massachusetts
Statehouse were among the victims of what appeared to be strong
sentiment against the Democratic political establishment.
   In a Republican U.S. Senate primary, real estate developer James
Rappaport defeated businessman Dan Daly and will challenge
Democratic U.S. Sen. John Kerry. With 64 percent of the precincts
reporting in that race, Rappaport had 154,387 votes, or 66 percent,
to Daly's 79,439 votes, or 34 percent.
   In Oklahoma, both parties held runoffs to complete the process
begun in an Aug. 28 primary.
   With all precincts counted in the Democratic runoff, Walters,
the party's 1986 nominee, had slipped past U.S. Rep. Wes Watkins by
fewer than 7,000 votes - 242,997 to 236,181.
   In the Republican race, Price won by even fewer votes - he
received 94,588 to businessman Vince Orza's 91,542. Both men are
newcomers to politics.
   Price, who was beaten badly in the regular primary by Orza,
said: ``It's been a long trail, but this comeback tonight has to be
one of the greatest comebacks in the annals of Oklahoma political
history.''
   ``It is just absolutely incredible,'' he told cheering
supporters in Oklahoma City.
   For the ballot question, there were 436,347 ``yes'' votes to
limit legislative service, and 212,318 ``no'' votes, a 67-to-33
percent margin.
   In Washington state, state Supreme Court Justice Richard Guy was
elected to the high court bench, beating back a challenge from
former Republican Gov. John Spellman. Guy had been appointed to the
bench. With 81 percent of the precincts counted, Guy had 257,789
votes and Spellman had 212,841.
   ---
   In Massachusetts, nearly everyone seemed to be running against
Dukakis, for whom the loss to George Bush in the 1988 presidential
campaign was just the beginning of a political career gone sour.
   No one, it seemed, wanted to be associated with the man once
credited with presiding over ``the Massachusetts Miracle.'' This
time, the catch-phrase of the campaign was ``the Massachusetts
Mutiny,'' the tag given to Murphy's attempted coup.
   The lieutenant governor tried to impose her own fiscal solutions
after Dukakis left on a trade mission to Europe earlier this month.
Nothing came of it except the collapse of Murphy's already failing
campaign.
   Bellotti, who won Murphy's endorsement after she dropped out,
appealed to voters as an experienced politician who could
straighten up the fiscal mess. Silber contended her withdrawal made
Bellotti the candidate of the political establishment.
   In making his first bid for public office, Silber didn't tone
down his style. The ``Silber shocker'' that may have caused the
biggest furor came when he suggested during a debate that the state
may want to ration health care. ``When you've had a long life and
you're ripe, then it's time to go,'' he said.
   Last week, asked about giving a crime control speech in an
inner-city neighborhood, Silber said there was no point addressing
``a group of drug addicts.''
   Weld portrayed Pierce as someone who failed to bring about
change during his six terms in the Legislature. Pierce focused on
Weld's wealth, touting himself as the more electable candidate.
   The Oklahoma primary campaign was the state's most expensive in
history on both sides. Watkins, who is leaving Congress after seven
terms, listed $1.8 million in contributions. Walters listed more
than $1 million.
   The latest campaign reports showed Price nearing $1 million in
expenditures, including $435,000 of his own money. Orza reported
about $315,000, including $150,000 of his own funds.

<HEAD>Human Rights Group Says Government Forces Killed Hundreds Of

   Sri Lanka's security forces have in recent months
killed hundreds of civilians during raids on villages where rebels
operate, Amnesty International said today.
   ``Entire communities have been attacked in retaliation for
opposition violence, the international human rights group said in a
report.
   ``Many people have been arbitrarily rounded up, and sometimes
killed, on the basis of anonymous accusations of subversive
involvement,'' it said.
   In June, government soldiers who had regained control of the
town of Kalmunai after separatist Tamil Tigers left it ``rounded up
many young men, stabbed them to death with bayonets, and burned
their bodies in shops,'' the report says.
   ``Indeed, the government appears to condone the summary killing
of suspected (Tamil Tiger) members.''
   As many as 30,000 people are believed to have died in 1988 and
1989 in the south of Sri Lanka, where the government faced
Sinhalese rebels, the report says. Those rebels oppose the
Sinhalese-dominated government's offer of autonomy to the Tamils in
an effort to end the separatist fighting.
   ``Although reports of extra-judicial executions and
`disappearances' in southern Sri Lanka diminished after March 1990,
they did not cease, and intimidation and death threats by
government forces continued,'' Amnesty said.
   ``With the renewed heavy fighting between government and the
Tamil Tigers ... in the northeast since June, Amnesty International
fears the pervasive pattern of violations is continuing,'' the
report says.
   The human rights group said the Sinhalese extremist People's
Liberation Front, Tamil separatists and the Indian peacekeeping
force deployed in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990 were all guilty
of serious human rights abuses.
   In the south, where the dominant group is Sinhalese, the
government is opposed by the People's Liberation Front. In the
northeast the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or Tamil Tigers,
are fighting for a separate Tamil state.
   Fighting continues in the northeast, and more than 300,000
people have fled their homes in the Jaffna district, Amnesty said.
   Since 1987, the report said, the United National Party
government of President Ranasinghe Premadasa had apparently allowed
its security forces to ruthlessly suppress armed opposition.
   ``Thousands of people have `disappeared' or been killed at the
hands of security forces in recent years in the south and hundreds
more have fallen victim to this violence in the latest wave of
repression in the northeast,'' Amnesty International said.
   Since 1987 the security forces had killed under many guises: in
uniform, in plainclothes operations attributed to ``vigilantes,''
and in death squads, Amnesty said.

   The huge Men's Central Jail, packed with
thousands of county prisoners, was an unlikely place for Charles H.
Keating Jr. to end up.
   The 66-year-old Keating has been an athlete, pilot, crusader
against pornography, lawyer, presidential commission member,
associate of lawmakers, real estate developer, millionaire
businessman and philanthropist.
   Keating surrendered Tuesday to face a 42-count indictment
alleging fraudulent sales of worthless junk bonds to thousands of
elderly investors through his collapsed Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association of Irvine.
   A judge ordered him held on $5 million bail. Next stop was the
huge Los Angeles County jail amid factories, rail tracks and
wrecking yards east of downtown. He joined 6,700 other prisoners
there.
   ``We keep it under the federal limits, but just barely,'' Hal
Grant, a Sheriff's spokesman said of the jail's population.
   Keating, who controlled Lincoln as chairman of American
Continental Corp. of Phoenix, Ariz., was born Dec. 4, 1923, to a
prominent Cincinnati family with strong connections to the
Republican Party.
   He became an accomplished competitive swimmer, served in the
Navy as a fighter pilot and emerged in public life in the late
1950s as a vigorous opponent of pornography, a campaign he
continued for three decades.
   President Nixon appointed him in 1970 to the Federal Commission
on Obscenity and Pornography.
   One of his first actions was to sue to prevent publication of a
commission report until he could write a dissent to the conclusion
that pornography did not pose a threat.
   Keating gained business experience as a vice president and
director of American Financial Corp., billionaire Carl H. Lindner's
banking, insurance, real estate and meatpacking empire.
   But it was there he had his first misadventure with federal
regulators.
   The Securities Exchange Commission claimed the pair fraudulently
diverted company assets to their own use. In 1979 Keating signed a
consent decree admitting no wrongdoing, but promising not to do it
again.
   He later claimed that signature cost him an appointment by
President Reagan as ambassador to the Bahamas.
   In the mid-1970s Keating had become the head of an American
Financial homebuilding subsidiary, Continental Homes Inc. of
Phoenix. He bought it out in 1978 and renamed it American
Continental Corp. Keating then became known for his large
contributions to politicians at every level.
   Lincoln was purchased by Keating in 1984 for $51 million. What
was once a traditional home mortgage lender soon came under the
scrutiny of federal thrift regulators. They said its heavy
investments in speculative real estate deals and junk bonds were
combined with accounting gimmickry to hide losses that ultimately
may cost taxpayers $2 billion.
   Lincoln was seized by the Home Loan Bank Board last year, two
years after examiners recommended that action. Critics contend
Keating and associates kept regulators at bay with heavy donations
to politicians.
   Keating, who says he is now broke, has maintained the seizure
was unnecessary, drove American Continental Corp. into bankruptcy
and stemmed from regulators' anger over his vocal criticism of them
as incompetent.

<HEAD>U.S. Syphilis Rate Climbs to Highest Level Since 1949</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. syphilis rate has risen 34 percent since
1981 to its highest level in 40 years, suggesting precautions
spurred by the AIDS outbreak have waned, scientists reported today.
   A separate study also in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association said the most common, inexpensive methods of treating
gonorrhea should be abandoned because of sharp rises in both the
penicillin-resistant and tetracycline-resistant strains of the
disease.
   In the first study, researchers at the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta said the biggest increase in syphilis was among
blacks. The rate among blacks more than doubled between 1985 and
1989, to 121.8 cases from 52.6 cases per 100,000 people, they said.
   In contrast, syphilis rates among white males have dropped 69
percent since 1982. The disease rate for white females remained low
and unchanged.
   Overall, 18.4 of every 100,000 Americans were treated for
syphilis last year, up from the 13.7 cases per 100,000 treated in
1981, the study showed. Last year's rate was higher than at any
time since 1949.
   The rate has risen most sharply in the past four years, which
may reflect a decline in concern about AIDS, researchers said.
   ``Obviously the message has not gotten out to certain groups,''
said one of the study's authors, Dr. Allyn K. Nakashima of the
CDC's division of sexually transmitted diseases.
   Researchers said the higher rate among blacks may be linked to a
higher incidence of drug abuse, poverty and homelessness. ``This is
just one more problem that can be attached to that disenfranchised
group,'' Nakashima said.
   The gonorrhea study found that although the incidence of the
disease has decreased since 1975, infections caused by strains
resistant to treatment with penicillin and tetracycline are a
growing problem.
   In the 1987-88 study, researchers examined 6,204 cases from 21
clinics nationwide, and 21 percent showed potential for resistance
to both treatments as well as to two other often-used drugs,
cefoxitin and spectinomycin.
   The CDC recommends gonorrhea be treated with ceftriaxone, which
is at least seven times more expensive than common treatments and
is the only treatment that works on all of the disease's strains,
said the study's primary author, Dr. Sandra K. Schwarcz.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Broadway production of ``Miss Saigon,''
canceled in a dispute over the casting of a white actor as a
Eurasian pimp, will arrive in New York next spring as originally
scheduled.
   Producer Cameron Mackintosh made the decision after reaching an
agreement with Actors' Equity over the casting of other roles in
the musical, which is a hit in London.
   The union leadership, in a meeting described as tense and tough,
approved the pact Monday.
   In a statement, Mackintosh and the union said the producer
``acknowledges Equity's efforts to improve equal employment
opportunities for its ethnic members, and he and his creative team
support that goal.''
   Mackintosh had scrapped the $10 million musical on Aug. 8, the
day after Actors' Equity barred white Englishman Jonathan Pryce
from repeating in New York his portrayal of the Eurasian brothel
owner. The union, which has veto power over foreign actors in the
United States, said it would be offensive to cast a white in the
role.
   The ban stirred debate over color-blind casting and minority
opportunities on stage, and the union later reversed itself.
   But Mackintosh sought assurances that he would have a free hand
in other casting decisions for the musical, a love story set during
the closing days of the Vietnam War. Of the nearly 50 performers in
the large cast, some 34 roles are played by ethnic minority actors,
including 27 Asians.
   Equity and the producer began meetings on Sept. 6.
   The agreement, according to The New York Times, lets the
producer use two non-American Asian actors in the Broadway
production for one year. He must request permission to bring over
Lea Salonga, a Filipino who plays the leading female role in the
London production.
   Mackintosh also will agree not to use yellow-face makeup or
facial devices designed to simulate Asian eyes in any American
production and to make an effort to recruit Asian-American actors
for lesser roles in the show.
   The producer also will seek minority performers for two of his
long-running hits on Broadway and on the road, ``The Phantom of the
Opera'' and ``Les Miserables.''
   ``Miss Saigon'' had sold a record $25 million in advance tickets
before the cancellation.

<HEAD>Mohawks Clash With Troops Seizing Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KAHNAWAKE, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indians brawled with Canadian troops
who were seizing weapons at a Mohawk reservation, and soldiers
fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. At least 82 people were hurt,
officials said.
   Dozens of men, women and children jumped into the cold St.
Lawrence River on Tuesday to escape the stinging gas.
   Mohawks punched and kicked soldiers, who used rifle butts and
fists in the brawl after the Indians intervened during the
search-and-seizure operation at the Kahnawake reservation by the
military and Quebec provincial police.
   It was one of the most violent clashes since the Mohawk standoff
began more than two months ago over plans by the city of Oka, 18
miles west of Montreal, to build a golf course extension on what
the Indians say is tribal land.
   The federal government has since bought the disputed land in an
attempt o settle the quarrel, but some Mohawk activists have held
out for settlement of other grievances including demands for
greater sovereignty.
   Eight helicopters and about 100 troops took part in the raid on
Tekakwitha Island.
   Maj. Rusty Bassarab, a military spokesman, said the raid netted
about 50 weapons, ranging from shotguns and handguns to hunting
rifles and AK-47 assault rifles. The weapons, wrapped in plastic,
were found under rocks in the forest and were taken out by
helicopter.
   But Mohawks struck back. One soldier was dragged to the ground,
punched, kicked and struck repeatedly on the head with his own
helmet.
   Bassarab said between five and seven soldiers were injured by
the Mohawks.
   The soldiers fired several volleys of submachine-gun fire into
the air and then shot tear gas point-blank into the crowd, forcing
them back. Dozens of people jumped into the river to evade the
fumes.
   About 75 people, including several children, were treated at the
nearby Kateri Memorial Hospital for tear gas and released.
   Dr. Louis Montour, medical director of the hospital, said a
15-year-old girl with a possible fractured hip and a 24-year-old
man with a possible fractured knee were sent to Montreal General
Hospital by ambulance.
   The clash at the reserve on the south shore of the St. Lawrence
River shifted attention away from Kahnesatake, near Oka, where the
military has surrounded about 50 Mohawks in a drug and alcohol
treatment center.
   Mike Myers, an American chief who is trying to reach a
settlement in the Oka standoff, said Tuesday night that the battle
in Kahnawake ``is certainly toughening the attitude of the Mohawks
In Kahnesatake.''
   The Mohawks had erected barricades in front of approaches to the
Mercier Bridge, a major commuter link to Montreal, after the July
11 botched provincial police raid on an Indian roadblock at the
Mohawk settlement in Kahnesatake.
   A police officer was killed in the July assault, which was
launched to enforce a court order that the Oka roadblock be
dismantled.
   Troops dismantled the Oka roadblock after the Mercier Bridge
barricades were removed by troops and Mohawks late last month.

   A brick facade that collapsed on a busy
sidewalk, killing three people and injuring eight, apparently was
improperly anchored and was pulled down by signs and iron shutters
attached to it, officials say.
   Don Kligerman, commissioner of the Department of Licenses and
Inspections, said the accident Tuesday could lead to criminal
charges.
   The two-story facade of two storefronts gave way shortly before
2:30 p.m. between 9th and 10th streets on Market Street, one of the
city's main arteries.
   Among the 11 passersby caught in the collapse were four police
officers walking a beat. Two of the injured were seriously hurt.
   ``It happened so fast you couldn't see anything,'' said Alom
Kadosh, manager of a stereo store. ``But as soon as it happened
people went outside and everybody pitched in to help pull off the
bricks and the metal that covered the people that had been trapped
underneath.''
   Neil Daniel was trying to fix his car when he heard a rumble and
screams.
   ``I looked up and saw a wall of bricks coming at me and all I
could do was close my eyes,'' he said.
   The cause of the accident was under investigation, but
authorities said they believed the wall was not properly anchored
to the 19th-century building.
   ``It appears the weight of signs and security gates may have
caused the collapse, but it will have to be checked by engineers,''
said Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer.
   Kligerman said the owners of the building were cited in June for
putting up the sign over a check-cashing agency without obtaining a
zoning permit. He said the sign apparently extended too far over
the sidewalk. The case has not reached court.
   ``The cumulative effect of that sign, the iron shutters and the
wall that was just free standing - it was really just a matter of
time until it fell over,'' Kligerman said.
   It was not immediately clear who owned the building.
   Three of the injured died on arrival at a hospital - a woman and
a man of crushed chests, another woman of head injuries.
   The husband of one of the dead was listed in critical condition
with a broken pelvis and facial bones, and a man was in serious
condition with chest and head injuries.

   An ex-CIA agent who acted as a middleman in the
Iran-Contra affair faces up to 16 years in prison and $1 million in
fines after being convicted of hiding arms profits from U.S. tax
collectors.
   A jury deliberated 3{ hours Tuesday before convicting Thomas G.
Clines, 61, of understating his earnings on his 1985 and 1986
returns and failing to disclose his foreign financial accounts.
   The Middleburg, Va., man bought and arranged shipments of
machine guns, rifles, grenades and explosives to Nicaragua's Contra
rebels.
   Sentencing was set for Oct. 31.
   Clines made at least $882,953 during the two-year affair but
understated the amount by at least $260,440, the Internal Revenue
Service said.
   He also kept some of his profits in a Swiss account that should
have been reported to the IRS, government witnesses said.
   Prosecutors depicted Clines as a sophisticated international
businessman who reported only the arms deal profits he thought the
IRS would find out about.
   Defense attorney Paula M. Junghans said Clines misunderstood or
was unfamiliar with the rules.
   Witnesses testified that Clines was in the arms business with
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and his Iranian
business partner, Albert Hakim.
   The Iran-Contra scandal involved the covert sale of arms to Iran
and efforts to supply weapons to the Contras at a time when
Congress banned such assistance.
   Profits were split among Secord, Hakim and Clines. Secord
pleaded guilty last year to making false statements to the
Iran-Contra congressional committees. He was placed on two years'
probation.

<HEAD>President Jaruzelski To Step Down Early, Paving Way For Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who as Communist
leader tried to crush Solidarity in 1981 and all but surrendered
power last year, will step down down early as president, his office
announced today.
   The move will allow Poland, the first East bloc country to oust
ruling Communists when a Solidarity-led government was formed last
year, to complete its transition to democracy with the popular
election of a president.
   On Monday, Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa became the first
person declare his candidacy for the post. Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki is also known to be considering a bid for president.
   Parliament is to begin debate Thursday on a schedule for the
elections, which are expected as early as this fall and no later
than the spring.
   Jaruzelski's announcement came a day after he met with Walesa
and Mazowiecki and they agreed on accelerating plans for holding
post-Communist Poland's first fully democratic general elections.
   The current Parliament, elected last year, includes holdovers
from the old regime who as part of a political compromise took
seats without a challenge at the polls.
   A spokesman for Jaruzelski said in a statement that the general
wishes Parliament ``to enable him to transfer the office he holds
to a president chosen in a general election.''
   Jaruzelski was elected to a six-year term as president by
Parliament in July 1989, with some support from Solidarity members,
largely to smooth relations with the Soviet Union in the early
months of democratic change.
   But it became increasingly apparent as his former political
opponents took control of government that he would not serve much
of the term.
   The Solidarity-led government took power in September and the
Communist Party dissolved itself in January.
   Jaruzelski, who had interned Walesa and Mazowiecki along with
thousands of other labor activists when he imposed martial law, is
technically empowered as president to run the army, the police and
the nation's foreign policy.
   But he has taken a back-seat role and never interfered with the
Solidarity-led overhaul of Poland's government and economy.
   The struggle over governing Poland is now among people who once
joined together to challenge Jaruzelski.
   Walesa has broken with Mazowiecki and some other former
Solidarity allies in government over the pace of change. He says
too many members of the ousted Communist regime are still in
positions of authority and ought to be removed.
   A public opinion poll conducted Sept. 3-4 and published Tuesday
showed Mazowiecki was supported for president by 48 percent of
those surveyed, compared with 37 percent for Walesa. The rest had
no opinion.
   The poll also showed a drop in confidence in the government to
61 percent from 82 percent in January, when sweeping
market-oriented reform went into effect that caused higher prices
and unemployment in the shift to capitalism.
   The statement issued by Jaruzelski's spokesman referred to
Tuesday's meeting and said the president would forward a letter to
the speaker of the Parliament's lower house asking that a date be
set for ending his term.
   Participants in Tuesday's meeting suggested Jaruzelski resign no
later than Dec. 13, the ninth anniversary of the day he declared
martial law to try to crush the Solidarity movement, the Gazeta
Wyborcza newspaper reported today.
   The 67-year-old Jaruzelski remains a complex figure in Poland's
political life. Some credit him with preventing a Warsaw Pact
invasion and bloodshed by having Polish forces crack down on
Solidarity.
   He is also is the only Communist leader in the East bloc to stay
in office aftr democratic change.
   Jaruzelski joined the Polish Communist Party in 1947, rising
through the ranks until he was appointed defense minister in 1968.
   In 1981, as Poland was being rocked by labor unrest, Jaruzelski
was named first secretary of the Communist Party - the only career
military officer to rise to supreme power in the East bloc.
   Although he has spoken of the ``very painful'' decision to
impose martial law, he has never repudiated the declaration,
leaving open the question of whether a patriotic wish to avoid
Soviet intervention or loyalty to the Kremlin prompted the decree.

   The dollar rallied in European trading this
morning following an up and down session in Tokyo.
   Gold prices were lower.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 138.05 yen, up 0.37 yen from
Tuesday's close. Later in London, it was quoted at 137.95 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   -1.5515 German marks, up from 1.5480
   -1.2975 Swiss francs, up from 1.2825
   -5.1975 French francs, up from 5.1845

   -1,162.00 Italian lire, up from 1,160.00
   -1.1585 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1573
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9145, compared
with $1.9190 late Tuesday.
   The dollar dropped against most major European currencies in
Tokyo after the U.S. government reported larger than expected
foreign trade deficit of $9.33 billion in July, up from June's
revised $5.34 billion.
   The dollar rose against the yen in a technical rebound despite
the trade figures and the U.S. government announcement Tuesday that
the August consumer price index was up 0.8 percent, Kakimoto said.
   ``But the trend is still for the yen to go up and the dollar to
go down, because the U.S. economic fundamentals are bad,'' said
Toshiaki Kakimoto, chief economist at Sumitomo Bank.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$386.45 per ounce at midmorning, down from $388.25 bid per ounce
late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $386.30, down from $387.00 late
Tuesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped $4.50 an ounce today, to close at
$385.35.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.80 a troy ounce,

   ``There isn't no foreign company that makes any decent working
pickup. It's either going to be big, or some little faggot truck,''
the farmer said.
   Bierly said that interview will be deleted when an edited

   About 6,000 Chevrolet dealers and salespeople last month went

   John Silber, Boston University's blunt and caustic
president, upset former state Attorney General Francis Bellotti for
the Democratic nomination for governor as voters swept out
candidates with ties to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   Silber, who was all but written off a week ago for referring to
an inner-city neighborhood as a ``group of drug addicts,'' will
face Republican William Weld, a former federal prosecutor, in
November.
   In Oklahoma, voters on Tuesday approved a first-in-the-nation
constitutional amendment limiting state lawmakers to 12 years in
office. In runoff elections for the gubernatorial nomination,
Democrat David Walters and Republican Bill Price slipped past their
opponents by as few as 3,046 votes.
   ``It is time to put limits on the professional politicians,''
said businessman Lloyd Noble II, chief backer of the limit on
legislative careers.
   Both men in Oklahoma were newcomers to politics, as was Silber
in Massachusetts, where the native Texan styled himself a political
outsider and stunned the state Democratic establishment in winning.
   ``There was a tidal wave coming and we happened to be standing
on the beach when it hit,'' Massachusetts Attorney General James
Shannon said after losing his re-election bid.
   Shannon and Bellotti were among several Democrats with ties to
the Dukakis administration who were swept away amid the state's
inability to come to grips with a crumbling economy. Dukakis, like
Republican Gov. Henry Bellmon of Oklahoma, is stepping down.
   With 93 percent of the precincts reporting, Silber had 520,926
votes, or 54 percent, to Bellotti's 423,390 votes, or 44 percent.
Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy had 27,546 votes, or 3 percent. She was on
the Democratic ballot despite having dropped out following a mutiny
against Dukakis in which she tried to take control of the state's
finances while he was in Europe.
   Weld also won an outsider's victory in the GOP primary,
defeating House Minority Leader Steven Pierce, an early favorite.
With 93 percent of the vote in, Weld had 245,179 votes, or 60
percent, and Pierce 163,508 votes, or 40 percent.
   Silber, a 64-year-old shoot-from-the-hip educator whose ``drug
addicts'' remark was one of his trademark ``Silber shockers,'' said
he would continue to emphasize his 19 years as BU president as
experience that qualifies him to change the ailing state
government.
   ``The choice is between leadership proven by experience or more
of the same,'' Silber told cheering supporters at his victory
party. ``Have you had enough? I think you have. Then join me in
taking back our government.''
   Weld said only Republicans would provide the change voters want.
   ``Massachusetts has lost its way,'' Weld, 45, told jubilant
backers. ``Politicians on Beacon Hill have grown arrogant and
cynical. They see the taxpayers as a limitless source of cash with
which to feather their own nests or fund their latest
experiments.''
   In the other major statewide contest, businessman James
Rappaport, who spent $2 million of his own money on his first major
campaign, easily defeated Dan Daly for the right to oppose
Democratic incumbent John Kerry in the U.S. Senate race in
November.
   In Oklahoma, voters approved the limit on lawmakers' tenure by a
2-1 margin. The amendment takes effect Jan. 1; lawmakers now in
office will be allowed to serve 12 more years.
   In the gubernatorial race, Walters, the Democrats' 1986 nominee,
slipped past U.S. Rep. Wes Watkins, 242,997 votes to 236,181. The
Republican nominee, Price, won by even less, beating businessman
Vince Orza 94,588 to 91,542.
   ``You've heard me say this before, it's time to put someone
different in the governor's office,'' said Walters, who overcame
controversy in 1986 about a $162,500 loan that was the subject of
an ethics complaint.
   In Washington state, former Republican Gov. John Spellman's
political comeback fell short. He lost in his bid to unseat state
Supreme Court Justice Richard Guy.

   Iraq said today that it has frozen all

   The state-run Iraqi News Agency said the ruling Revolutionary

in Iraq and abroad.''
   The seven-man ruling council is Iraq's highest policy-making
body, headed by President Saddam Hussein.
   INA did not mention how much money was involved in the freeze.

<TEXT>
   An appeals court ruled a member of the
Ku Klux Klan can keep her ``ARYAN-1'' personalized license plate
because state law prohibits obscene or profane words but not
inflammatory ones.
   It was the latest ruling in a four-year legal battle over a
plate owned by Mary E. Carr, a member of the Missouri Klan.
   The state Department of Revenue, which issues license plates,
said Tuesday's ruling by the state Court of Appeals could lead to
problems with plates that contain racist or derogatory terms.
   Duane Benton, the department's director, said an appeal to the
Missouri Supreme Court is being considered.
   Neither Ms. Carr nor Richard Petrofsky, an American Civil
Liberties Union lawyer representing her, could be reached for
comment.
   After a complaint from the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai
B'rith, the revenue department ordered Ms. Carr in September 1986
to surrender the license plate it had issued three months earlier.
   The department argued that under state law license plates cannot
be profane, obscene or conflict with ``an overriding public
policy.'' Benton said his office has used the public-policy
exception to deny objectionable plates and avoid problems
encountered in other states.
   Discrimination is illegal, and a racist plate violates that
public policy, the state argued. ``Aryan'' was used by the Nazis to
describe a superior race and is a racist word when used on a Klan
car, it said.
   But the appeals court said Benton went beyond his authority and
state law in denying the plate.

   A teen-ager convicted of helping his

to 30 years in prison without parole, or the death penalty.
   A jury on Tuesday convicted Damon Lundgren, 19, on four murder
counts and four counts of kidnapping in the 1989 slayings of Dennis
Avery and his three children. He was acquitted of killing Avery's
wife, Cheryl.
   The family was found bound and gagged, shot to death and dumped
into a common grave under a barn at a farm in Kirtland, 30 miles
east of Cleveland.
   The trial's penalty phase was scheduled to begin Monday. The
same jury that convicted Lundgren's father must decide whether to
recommend the death penalty.
   Jeffrey Lundgren, 40, was convicted last month on five murder
and kidnapping counts but has not yet been sentenced. His wife,
Alice, received five consecutive life sentences last month for her
conspiracy, complicity and kidnapping convictions.
   Sentencing options for Lundgren and his son included the death
penalty, life in prison without parole for 20 years, and life
without parole for 30 years.
   The younger Lundgren, described as a model student by a
classmate who testified at his trial, calmly held his hands on his
lap with his head down as the verdict was read.

been sent back to China on the often rickety fishing boats that
brought them to Taiwan.
   At least 46 Chinese illegal immigrants have died in accidents
during forced repatriations over the last two months.
   Under the agreement, vessels painted with Red Cross flags will
carry illegal immigrants directly from the Nationalist-held Matsu
islet 10 miles to Mawei, a port near Fuzhou in the Chinese province
of Fujian.
   ``We all agree the repatriation should be done with concerns for
humanitarianism, safety, and convenience,'' Chen Chang-wen,
secretary general of Taiwan's Red Cross Association, told a news
conference.
   The new repatriation is scheduled to begin in October and will
mark the first time boats have legally sailed between Taiwan and
China since 1949, when Nationalists fled to Taiwan after losing a
civil war to the Communists.
   Chen said a five-member delegation of China's Red Cross
Association discussed the issue with its Taiwanese counterpart in a
two-day meeting on Taiwan's Quemoy island last week.
   Officials said more than 10,000 illegal immigrants from China
seeking jobs in Taiwan have been caught and repatriated since 1987,
when the Nationalists relaxed a policy to allow private contacts
between Taiwanese and Chinese.
  Thousands of Taiwanese have also journeyed to the mainland,
usually entering China through Hong Kong or Japan. Taiwanese have
also invested billions of dollars in China's economy. Still, the
Nationalist government continues to reject official contacts with
its rival government in Beijing.

   An Army paratrooper suffered a
superficial leg wound today when struck by shrapnel from a
misguided artillery shell during live-fire exercises in the Saudi
desert.
   The 105mm struck sand and exploded about 100 yards from an
infantry platoon from the 82nd Airborne Division that was lying in
the sand to prepare for firing exercises.
   One of the soldiers, identified by others in the platoon as Pvt.
Gustavo Torres of Puerto Rico, was struck in the right calf by a
piece of shrapnel from the artillery shell.
   Torres was treated at the scene - the wound required only
cleaning and bandaging - and stayed while his unit completed its
training.
   Lt. Col. Ned Spohn, the commander of the artillery battery that
fired the shell, speculated that human error was to blame for the
shot, but said it was also possible the howitzer had suddenly
shifted in the desert sand.
   Spohn was using a hand-held satellite position locator to chart
the exact location of the platoon and the shell as part of the
Army's investigation.
   The accident was witnessed by a dozen reporters and
photographers at the firing range to watch the exercises.

   Ezra Taft Benson, the 91-year-old
president of the Mormon Church, was listed in fair condition today
after being hospitalized.
   LDS Hospital spokesman Tim Madden said Benson was admitted about
12:30 p.m. Tuesday for observation.
   Benson ``wasn't feeling well, so his doctors decided, in view of
his age, to put him into the hospital and keep a watch on him,''
said Don LeFevre, spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints.
   The doctors decided Tuesday evening to keep him overnight,
LeFevre said.
   Benson was not in the intensive-care unit, the nursing
supervisor said.
   Benson, who served as agriculture secretary in the Eisenhower
administration and became president of the 7.5 million-member
church in 1985, was last hospitalized for four days in June for
treatment of a bacterial infection.
   In November 1986, Benson had a heart pacemaker implanted. On
Jan. 11, 1986, two months after assuming the presidency, Benson
suffered a fainting spell and was rushed to the hospital for tests
and observation.
   Frail because of his age, Benson has attended but hasn't
addressed the church's recent general conferences.

<HEAD>Oakland Police Reopen 200 Rape Cases That May Have Been Improperly
Dropped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a San Francisco Bay area
crisis center says she's gratified Oakland police will reopen about
200 rape cases after admitting they blundered by dropping numerous
investigations.
   ``I think they're trying,'' said Marcia Blackstock, executive
director of Bay Area Women Against Rape. ``They've been really
candid with me that they really messed up and need to make some
changes.''
   The Police Department announced Monday it would reopen the
sexual assault cases after an investigation showed that nearly one
in four Oakland female complainants had her case thrown out as
unfounded.
   ``Candidly, we blew it,'' Police Chief George Hart said. ``I
think we got into a procedure there that was contrary to the way we
want to do business.''
   Hart said police would take immediate action to correct the
problem.
   A police audit of the department's rape investigations came
after a probe by the San Francisco Examiner showed that nearly one
in four women who reported a rape to Oakland police last year had
her case tossed out as being without merit. That's 2{ times the
rate of any other major California city.
   Of the 967 rape cases reported to Oakland police between 1989
and the first half of this year, 203 were classified as unfounded.
   The internal audit, which included every rape case in the city
during the past two years, found 37 cases in which detectives filed
a report away, as if it had never happened, without once contacting
the victim.
   In addition, the department plans to contact 166 other women who
reported rapes but whose cases police dropped even though the cases
did not meet the U.S. Justice Department's criteria for
``unfounding'' a case.
   Some cases were declared unfounded if the victims were
prostitutes, if drugs were involved in the incident or if the
victim was uncooperative with officers or could not be contacted.
   Police Capt. Jim Hahn said the audit indicates that more than
half of the 203 cases may have been improperly declared without
merit.
   Hahn, who heads the department's criminal investigations
division, said the audit reveals that police had not thoroughly
investigated the cases before deeming them unfounded.
   ``I have instructed my investigators that everybody - all
victims on all unfounded cases - will be recontacted,'' Hahn said.
   Oakland police have six sexual assault investigators who handled
585 reported cases last year. By comparison, San Francisco had
eight detectives handling 385 cases last year.
   Though Hart there were no plans to increase the number of sexual
assault investigators, Hahn said he might rotate sergeants through
the sex-crimes unit so that a higher number of investigators would
on hand to handle such cases.

   A sniper perched near Interstate 10
struck at least six cars, including a police car, forcing officials
to close the freeway for more than an hour, police said today.
   No injuries were reported.
   A house and a car in the city of Beaumont, some 70 miles east of
Los Angeles, also were hit by bullets late Tuesday, police said. No
one was arrested by early today.
   A police spokesman said the bullets may have been hurled by a
high-powered slingshot, although at least two motorists said they
heard gunfire.
   The California Highway Patrol closed the intersection of
Interstate 10 and state Route 60 for about an hour shortly after
9:30 p.m. Tuesday, said CHP dispatcher Dorothy Boe.
   Damage to the six cars was limited to broken windows and dents,
said CHP officer Don Sackett.
   ``As of yet we don't believe there was a drive-by, but a
stationary sniper. Because of the number of vehicles and the time
elapsed, we believe someone was standing and shooting,'' Sackett
said.
   During the search, a police car and command post were hit by
bullets apparently hurled by a slingshot, said Beaumont police Sgt.
Mitch White.
   ``When the bullets hit our command post we didn't hear
gunfire,'' White said.
   The .38- and .45-caliber bullets looked as if they'd been fired
earlier, and picked up for use in the slingshot, he said.

<TEXT>
   West German authorities plan to arrest
suspected East German spies after the two countries unite on Oct.
3, the federal prosecutor's office said today.
   Lutz Stavenhagen, a top official in the chancellor's office in
Bonn, said that up to 8,000 East Germans could be apprehended. The
exact number was not certain.
   The announcement came after government officials in Bonn ruled
out any amnesty for the spy corps before Oct. 3, the day Germans
celebrate their unification.
   In East Berlin, the Interior Ministry said it had stopped
destroying secret police files that could incriminate hundreds of
people.
   On Tuesday, West Germany's federal prosecutor Alexander von
Stahl said East Germany's ex-secret police chief had set up
meetings between Palestinian guerrillas and a leftist West German
terror gang.
   Grappling with the brutal legacy of the secret police, called
the Stasi, has become a national obsession in East Germany in the
last days of the country's separate existence.
   Today, von Stahl's spokesman, Rolf Hannich, said the prosecutor
was legally required to issue arrest warrants for suspected Stasi
spies if there is no amnesty.
   Hannich declined to say how many suspected Stasi spies could be
arrested. He said agents facing arrest will be those who are
already under criminal investigations.
   In addition to a dreaded interior security agency that kept tabs
on millions of East Germans, the Communist regime's Stasi also ran
a formidable network of agents abroad.
   Stavenhagen, who is Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief intelligence
adviser, said the number of arrests could strain the court system.
   ``If there is no amnesty, our officials would have to issue some
7,000 to 8,000 arrest warrants over there immediately. The courts
would be totally overburdened,'' the newspaper Die Welt quoted
Stavenhagen as saying.
   In East Berlin, the Interior Ministry said it stopped destroying
Stasi files ``to put aside irritations.'' However, the ministry
repeated its assertion that it had only been getting rid of
duplicates.
   Since the fall of East German leader Erich Honecker in October
1989, there have been constant disclosures about his Communist
government's alleged support of terrorism.
   The latest such disclosure concerns imprisoned former secret
police chief Erich Mielke, 82, and his former deputy, Gerhard
Neiber.
   Both are suspected of having harbored members of West Germany's
leftist terrorist Red Army Faction, von Stahl said Tuesday. He said
a criminal investigation was under way.
   Proof of the allegations is contained in nearly 200 pages of
documents seized from the former secret police, von Stahl said in a
statement. A spokesman, Hans-Juergen Foerster, said it was too
early to tell when or whether Mielke or Neiber will be brought to
trial.
   East German police, working with their West German colleagues,
rounded up nine Red Army Faction terrorist suspects in June. They
had been living in East Germany under assumed names.
   The Red Army Faction has waged a deadly campaign against West
German businesses, military facilties and other targets.
   Von Stahl, in a television interview Monday night, said he
believed East German secret police were involved in the bombing of
West Berlin's La Belle discotheque in April 1986.
   That bombing led to the U.S. air raids on the Libyan cities of
Tripoli and Benghazi 10 days later, after Washington blamed Libya
for the attack. The La Belle attack killed two U.S. soldiers and a
Turkish woman.
   The disco was a popular spot for American servicemen in West
Berlin.
   In West Berlin, Justice Department spokesman Cornel Christoffel
said the Stasi had an inside agent who provided the East German
secret police with information before the attack. However, he said
he could not confirm that the Stasi played an active role in the La
Belle bombing.
   Honecker himself is the target of several criminal
investigations, including one in West Germany for obstruction of
justice.

   The handmade national AIDS quilt, vandalized for
the first time in its three-year history, will be restored,
organizers said.
   Two teddy bears were cut from two of the four 12-foot-by-12-foot
sections of the quilt on display last week at the Hotel
Inter-Continental, said Jerry Suarez, chairman of the South Florida
Names Project.
   The group set up the display in the hotel mezzanine in
conjunction with the national conference of the Council on
Foundations.
   ``It was very difficult to explain how much this meant,'' said
AIDS activist Shelley Rappaport, who had sewed one of the bears on
for a friend who died from acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
``It's like, would someone walk up to the Vietnam War Memorial and
start scratching names off?''
   Scott Lago, head of display marketing for the national Names
Project, which made the memorial quilt, said sections of it have
been displayed 257 times around the world this year. But the quilt
had never been vandalized before, he said Monday.
   On Saturday, four sections of the quilt were to be taken down
after the conference, but on Friday another group meeting at the
hotel, the Club Connection, asked that the quilt sections be
removed.
   That group, which bills itself as a selective singles group,
considered the display ``ugly,'' said the hotel's resident manager,
Jurgen Dinger.
   A hotel employee then took down the quilt sections without
consulting management, Dinger said.
   Suarez found the quilt wadded up in a closet Saturday and he
discovered two teddy bears had been cut.
   ``It's not just a teddy bear,'' Ms. Rappaport said. ``It's the
only memorial I have. That's why it hurts so much.''
   The other teddy bear, wearing surgical gloves, had been cut from
the panel dedicated to Suarez's father, a doctor.
   ``It didn't just come off,'' Suarez said. ``You could tell
someone took scissors to it.''
   Both teddy bears will be sewn back on, Ms. Rappaport said.

   Baghdad today began confiscating the
assets of all countries participating in economic sanctions against
Iraq. The seizure order also applies to all companies based in
countries enforcing the sanctions.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said the ruling Revolutionary
Command Council ordered the seizure Tuesday night under a law
dealing with the protection of ``Iraqi interests, money and rights
in Iraq and abroad.''
   ``All assets - cash deposits, property, interest and other
revenue - belonging to the governments, institutions, companies and
banks of the countries that have joined oppressive resolutions
against Iraq are hereby confiscated,'' said the new law, the text
of which was carried by INA.
   The statement did not provide estimates for foreign assets in
Iraq, or say how much cash was involved.
   Four days after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the U.N.
Security Council imposed an embargo on trade with Iraq, choking off
Iraq's oil exports and blocking goods heading for the nation. Most
countries, including the United States, have followed the
sanctions.
   Iraq will also collect any interest accumulated by the sezied
assets, the agency reported in a dispatch monitored in Nicosia.
   The council, headed by President Saddam Hussein, is Iraq's
highest policy-making body. It is the only body that can override
Iraq's National Council, or parliament.
   The text made no mention of Kuwait, but earlier council
decisions have stated that Iraqi law applies to the emirate, which
Baghdad annexed six days after the invasion.
   The United States and Britain froze Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets
immediately after the invasion. Other countries, including all
European Community nations, quickly followed suit.
   President Bush said in a televised message to the Iraqi people
on Sunday that Saddam's invasion of Kuwait was going to cost the
nation an average of $20 billion a year in lost oil revenue.
   Iraq piled up a foreign debt of $60 billion to $70 billion,
about half of it owed to Arab states, during its eight-year war
against Iraq which ended in 1988. It has unilaterally canceled its
debt of about $10 billion to Kuwait.
   The rest of the money is owed to Japan, Italy, Britain, France
and the Soviet Union, most of for arms bought on credit during the
war.
   The new Iraqi law said foreign governments that froze Iraqi
assets after the invasion of Kuwait, ``are responsible for
safeguarding the cash and the assets and for protecting any revenue
coming from accumulating interest on investments.''
   Banks, it added, were ``fully responsible for protecting Iraqi
cash plus the interest, revenue and any other rights owed to
Iraq.''
   Iraqi companies, private and government, ``are not responsibile
in any way for losses resulting from any delay by foreign firms in
fulfilling contracts in Iraq. But these firms are held responsible
for for any damge inflicted on the Iraqi side.''
   Iraqi courts have also been ordered to reject any application
for any case against Iraqi firms - private or government - and
declared any ruling by foreign courts against Iraqi firms ``null
and void.''

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has ruled that a
law barring some environmental suits against logging in old-growth
forests in Washington and Oregon was unconstitutional.
   Congress interfered with the authority of the courts when it
passed a law in October requiring them to dismiss the suits without
changing the laws on which the suits were based, the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals said in Tuesday's 3-0 ruling.
   The law required that federal courts dismiss suits that
cndividual timber sales as well as the U.S. Forest
Service's 1988 plan to protect northern spotthallenged some ied owl habitat
in
Washington and Oregon.
   It was part of legislation aimed at freeing up sales of timber
from Pacific Northwest forests while adding some protection for
spotted owl habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently
declared the owl a threatened species.
   The federal appeals court ruling means loggers will have to
change their tactics in blocking suits filed by environmentalists
who want to stop timber cutting.
   Tuesday's ruling came just 12 days before the measure was set to
expire at the end of the federal fiscal year.
   A lawyer for environmental groups said the decision may be in
time to thwart some timber sales and logging in old-growth forests
in the Pacific Northwest, and should se of Tuesday's ruling.
   A proposal to extend the restriction on lawsuits into the next
fiscal year was dropped Friday by Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., an
author of last year's measure.

   The chief index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange sagged
to its lowest close in 2{ years today, while the dollar
strengthened against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 158.65 points, or 0.66
percent, closing at 23,726.17. It was the Nikkei's lowest finish
since Feb. 9, 1988, when it ended trading at 23,662.27.
   On Tuesday, the closely watched index fell at one point to
23,308.31 before recovering in the afternoon to 23,884.82.
   Stock traders said investor pessimism - spurred by uncertainty
over the Middle East, inflation concerns and rising oil prices and
interest rates - was continuing to pull the market down.
   ``There were no special influences. Market sentiment is bad,''
said Haruo Ueno, manager of stock trading for Wako Securities.
   Tuesday's sharp fall and partial rebound represented mostly
technical movement, said Toshiaki Kakimoto, chief economist at
Sumitomo Bank.
   He said trading has been light this week because the first half
of the fiscal year for many companies ends Sept. 30.
   An estimated 360 million shares changed hands on the stock
market's first section today, down from 400 million shares on
Tuesday.
   ``Investors are just taking a wait-and-see attitude,'' said
Akira Yasui,head of research at County Natwest Securities Japan,
Ltd. He said many have pulled out of the market and have put their
cash instead into intermediate- and long-term deposits.
   Yasui said players also were waiting for indications from the
Bank of Japan that it will not raise its official discount rate in
the near future, after raising the rate five times since May last
year. ``If the Bank of Japan understands that higher interest rates
will damage the economy, the stock market will be stronger,'' he
said.
   He said the market was ``already in the bottom zone, but we
haven't come back up again. Investment sentiment will recover
gradually beyond the last quarter of this year. Now it is very,
very depressed, discouraged - the worst.''
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar ended trading at
138.05 yen, up 0.37 yen from Tuesday's close. After opening at
138.35 yen, it ranged between 138.05 yen and 138.85 yen.
   The dollar dropped against most major European currencies after
the U.S. government reported a foreign trade deficit of $9.33
billion in July, up from June's revised $5.34 billion. The
shortfall was nearly $2 billion greater than predicted.
   But the dollar rose against the yen in a technical rebound
despite the trade figures and the U.S. government announcement
Tuesday that the August consumer price index was up 0.8 percent,
Kakimoto said.
   Traders said they believed the dollar had been oversold.
   ``But the trend is still for the yen to go up and the dollar to
go down, because the U.S. economic fundamentals are bad,'' Kakimoto
said.
   Continuing weakness in the Japanese bond market also discouraged
yen buying, traders said.
   In bond dealings, the yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 8.560 percent, the same as
Tuesday, after trading at higher rates most of the day. The closing
price also was unchanged at 81.23 points.

<TEXT>
   The first meeting of what was to become
Cambodia's interim government ended in disagreement today, with the
warring factions arguing over how to guide the country to free
elections.
   The factions accused each other of trying to destroy the Supreme
National Council, formed a week earlier as part of a comprehensive
U.N. Security Council peace plan.
   The talks failed despite the intercession of diplomats from
Thailand and China, which arm the guerrillas but have been actively
seeking an agreement.
   ``Our regret is that in the three days of our meeting, we have
not been able to reach any agreement at all,'' Premier Hun Sen of
the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government told a news
conference.
   ``The first meeting is not yet over,'' he said. ``It's only a
temporary adjournment.'' A guerrilla spokesman said the talks could
resume within days.
   Meanwhile, the radio of the powerful Khmer Rouge guerrillas said
the pro-Vietnamese forces began an offensive Sept. 6 to retake the
rich gem-mining town of Pailin near the Thai border.
   It said the attack would last until November, including the span
of the U.N. General Assembly session, where Cambodia again will be
a major issue. The assembly session began on Tuesday.
   The Khmer Rouge had seized Pailin in October, shortly after
Vietnam made what it called the withdrawal of its last troops from
Cambodia.
   The Supreme National Council held only one formal meeting, at
the opening session Monday at the Cambodian Embassy. For the next
two days, the factions stayed in their Bangkok hotel.
   The council currently consists of six government representatives
and two from each of the three allied guerrilla groups: the Khmer
Rouge, the forces of former head of state Norodom Sihanouk and the
Khmer People's National Liberation Front led by former Premier Son
Sann.
   A plan adopted last month by the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council and embraced last week by the Cambodian
factions as a basis for a settlement says the council would be the
sole source of authority in the period before elections.
   It would, however, cede many of its powers to a U.N. interim
authority and peacekeeping force that would guarantee the
transition to democratic rule.
   The guerrilla coalition wants Sihanouk as the council's 13th
member and chairman, who could conceivably break a tie vote.
   Hun Sen said Sihanouk could be chairman but not an additional
member, and the vice chairman should be from the Hun Sen camp. If
Sihanouk joined as the 13th member, the government said it also
must have another member.
   Son Sann said if the guerrillas accepted Hun Sen as head of the
U.N. delegation, ``we accept the fait accompli of the occupation of
Cambodia by the Vietnamese. We cannot accept that when we have
fought for 11 years to liberate our country.''
   In a statement today, the Khmer Rouge said that rejecting
Sihanouk ``can only be construed as an attempt to ... prolong the
war in Cambodia.''
   Sihanouk said from his Beijing home that he was ill and could
not attend the meetings in Jakarta or this week in Bangkok.
   The Cambodian civil war began with Vietnam's late 1978 invasion,
which ended a radical communist Khmer Rouge rule in which hundreds
of thousands of people died.
   The U.N. Security Council plan is considered crucial because it
represents agreement on the part of powers that back different
sides in the conflict.
   Britain, China, France and the United States back the
guerrillas. The Soviet Union backs the government in Phnom Penh.
   Thailand and China, which arm the guerrillas, have been actively
seeking an agreement.
   With roughly 30,000 guerrillas and Chinese arms, the Khmer Rouge
is the most powerful guerrilla group.

   After getting the upper hand on a blaze
that gutted a tanker, officials today were assessing damages and
trying to afix blame in the explosion that set off the fire.
   Crews hoped that the mangled M.V. Jupiter would cool enough
today to begin salvaging and moving the vessel from the Saginaw
River, where the tanker was docked, said Tom Schneider, spokesman
for Total Petroleum Inc.
   One crewman is missing and believed dead.
   The 391-foot Jupiter had unloaded a little more than half its
cargo of 2.3 million gallons of gasoline when the fire broke out
Sunday and raged for 30 hours before being doused. It somehow
reignited Monday night.
   U.S. Coast Guard safety inspectors said the Jupiter must have
pulled away from its dock, splitting its fueling hose and spilling
gasoline as a series of explosions occurred. The source of the
ignition was undetermined.
   Ashland Oil Inc. of Ashland, Ky., which owns the company that
owns the Jupiter, thinks a passing coal freighter, the Buffalo, may
have created a wake that rocked the Jupiter, parting mooring lines
and causing a transfer hose to snap and spew gasoline.
   ``We have put American Steamship lines on notice that we hold
them responsible for the incident. We've done that through legal
channels,'' Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum said Tuesday.
   No lawsuits have been filed, however.
   American Steamship Co., owners of the 635-foot Buffalo, denied
that. The Buffalo would have been traveling ``dead slow'' - 1 to 2
mph, just fast enough to keep control in the river current,
American Steamship spokeswoman Kelly Pezone said from corporate
headquarters in Buffalo, N.Y.
   Buffalo skipper John MacFalda told Coast Guard investigators
Tuesday he was going as slow as possible as he passed the Jupiter.
The tanker appeared to have broken free from its moorings and was
pushed away from the dock by the wind, he said.
   Three of the tanker's 18 crewmen remained hospitalized today in
fair condition at Bay Medical Center. One crewman, Tom Sexton, 46,
of Iowa, was believed to have died while trying to swim ashore from
the burning tanker. Other crewmen were treated for minor injuries
Sunday.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan issued
a gloomy assessment of the U.S. economy today, saying the turmoil
in the Persian Gulf had introduced ``new and substantial risks''
for the prospects of continued growth.
   With all of the economic uncertainty, Greenspan said the Bush
administration and Congress should intensify their efforts to get a
credible package to reduce the budget deficit.
   As he has in the past, Greenspan predicted that such a deal
would give the Fed leeway to reduce interest rates, something the
administration has been seeking for months in an effort to avert
the first economic downturn in eight years.
   Greenspan said despite mounting evidence of widespread economic
weakness, he did not believe the country was currently in a
recession. But he listed a number of negative impacts stemming from
the more than $10 per barrel rise in oil prices since Aug. 2 and
said prospects of a downturn in the future could not be ruled out.
   ``Regrettably, events in the Middle East have introduced new and
substantial risks to the outlook,'' Greenspan said in testimony
before the congressional Joint Economic Committee.
   ``Just the enormous uncertainty about how and when the tensions
in the Persian Gulf will be resolved undoubtedly is affecting the
economy in a negative way,'' Greenspan said in his first comments
on the economy since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. To Supply More Jet Fighters and Missiles to Israel</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has agreed to supply Israel
with advanced F-15 jet fighters and Patriot missile batteries and
to increase American emergency stockpiles in the Jewish state,
Israel TV has reported.
   The United States also was considering new Israeli requests for
a special grant of $1 billion in military aid to cope with the cost
of a protracted army alert during the gulf crisis, the television
and state radio said Tuesday.
   The New York Times today quoted sources as saying that the Bush
administration would look favorably on the aid request if Israel
did not try to block the proposed $20 billion American arms sale to
Saudi Arabia.
   The weapons deal was reportedly a result of a meeting Tuesday
between Defense Minister Moshe Arens and Defense Secretary Richard
Cheney in Washington.
   Arens, interviewed by the television, declined to comment on the
reports.
   Israel has sought more American military aid to offset the
proposed weapons deal between the United States and Saudi Arabia,
an enemy of Israel's.
   Last month Israel asked for additional F-15 and F-16 fighter
jets and a leasing arrangement for U.S.-made Patriot anti-missile
missiles.
   The television said Cheney had decided to supply part of the
requests, saying he had agreed to expedite 15 F-15s and two Patriot
missile batteries, along with 10 advanced helicopters.
   Cheney also agreed to continue helping Israel develop the Arrow
missile, which is being designed to intercept short-range ballistic
missiles.
   The television said Cheney also promised a ``significant
increase'' in American emergency stockpiles kept in Israel, without
elaborating.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has repeatedly threatened to
attack Israel if his country comes under attack.

   Police briefly detained Winnie
Mandela today after finding spent bullet cartridges in her car.
   An angry Mrs. Mandela claimed the incident was part of an
ongoing plan to harass her and her husband, African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   The incident came a day after the government announced that it
will prosecute Mrs. Mandela on charges of kidnapping and assault
for the 1988 abduction and beating of four youths.
   The charges could harm negotiations between the ANC and the
government of President F.W. de Klerk.
   In her first public comment about the pending charges, Mrs.
Mandela said today: ``I welcome the decision in the sense it will
give me the chance to clear my name ... after this trial by
media.''
   Mrs. Mandela was traveling today in her white Mercedes Benz
through the Tokoza township southest of Johannesburg when she was
stopped at a police roadblock.
   ``Mrs. Mandela apparently picked up the shells while visiting,''
said a police spokeswoman, Capt. Ida van Zweel. ``She handed them
to a policeman. There is no crime involved.''
   Mrs. Mandela said she was taken to a local police station and
detained for almost three hours.
   ``Police harassment has never been a suprise to the Mandela
family,'' Mrs. Mandela said later. ``The dirty methods they are
using are nowhere near an end.''
   The ANC claimed Mrs. Mandela had been arrested. The group said
she had been invited to the township by residents who wanted to
hand over the spent cartridges from the recent black factional
fighting.
   The organization said it ``condemns the harassment meted out to
Mrs. Winnie Mandela'' by police ``intent on curbing the normal
activity of the ANC.''
   In the 1988 incident, four youths were allegedly abducted and
beaten at Mrs. Mandela's house in 1988 while her husband was still
imprisoned.
   One of the youths was killed, and the head of Mrs. Mandela's
former bodyguard unit, Jerry Richardson, has been convicted of
murder, kidnapping and assault. The three surviving youths
testified that Mrs. Mandela beat them with a whip.
   Mrs. Mandela is expected to be formally charged Monday on four
counts of kidnapping and four counts of assault.
   The ANC said it objected to Mrs. Mandela's ``trial by media,''
but did not criticize the government.
   Also today, President de Klerk met with his Cabinet, and Mandela
conferred with other ANC leaders as both sides sought solutions to
the violence in black townships around Johannesburg which has
claimed about 800 lives since early August.
   Local media reports said de Klerk was expected to announce
additional steps to curb the unrest, possibly a dusk-to-dawn
curfew.
   Police have been seaching for weapons, setting up roadblocks and
sending in reinforcements to the townships following the
announcement of operation ``Iron Fist'' on Saturday.
   Police also say they will mount machine guns on armored patrol
vehicles to counter the growing number of attacks on police. Sixty
policemen have been killed this year.
   Mandela has predicted the measures will be ineffective and
amount to a ``license to kill'' for the security forces. He also
has said the ANC, the largest black opposition movement, could
break off talks with the white-led government if it cannot stop the
bloodshed.
   Five people were injured, one seriously, when black men with
machetes and knives attacked passengers on a black communter train
west of Johannesburg on Tuesday, police said.
   The attack was similar to one last week in which assailants
killed 26 and wounded more than 100 on a train traveling from
Johannesburg to the neighboring Soweto township.
   The main combatants have been supporters of the ANC and Zulus
who back the conservative Inkatha movement.
   Both groups oppose apartheid, but differ on tactics and plans
for a future South Africa. Their power struggle in the eastern
province of Natal has claimed about 5,000 lives since 1986.
   The recent fighting has strained relations between government
and the ANC, and both sides have become increasingly critical of
the other.

<HEAD>Top Marine Calls Troop Entertainment Plan Ludicrous</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Al Gray
says it is ``ludicrous'' to send entertainers to visit American
forces in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf.
   The entertainment, organized by the USO, is inappropriate
because it ``detracts from the mission at hand,'' Gray told
reporters Tuesday during a visit to this Marine training base.
   ``We shouldn't be having any shows over there,'' Gray said.
   The United Service Organization has booked comedians Steve
Martin and Jay Leno, and it is seeking other big-name talent to
entertain the more than 150,000 American soldiers, sailors and
airmen deployed in the gulf area. Martin is scheduled to meet with
soldiers next month at an air base in the northeastern Saudi city
of Dharhan.
   ``That's ludicrous,'' said Gray, who made no mention of the
specific entertainers. ``Common sense will tell you'' that such
entertainment is inappropriate, he said.
   Gray, who rarely grants interviews, had little else to say about
the situation in Saudi Arabia except to note that the Marines are
continuing to ship supplies and equipment to improve their
capability to sustain a possible combat mission.
   About 45,000 Marines are in the gulf area, including about
12,000 from Camp Lejeune.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan issued
a gloomy assessment of the U.S. economy today, saying the turmoil
in the Persian Gulf had introduced ``new and substantial risks''
for the prospects of continued growth.
   With all of the economic uncertainty, Greenspan said the Bush
administration and Congress should intensify their efforts to get a
credible package to reduce the budget deficit.
   As he has in the past, Greenspan predicted that such a deal
would give the Fed leeway to reduce interest rates, something the
administration has been seeking for months in an effort to avert
the first economic downturn in eight years.
   Greenspan said despite mounting evidence of widespread economic
weakness, he did not believe the country was currently in a
recession. But he listed a number of negative impacts stemming from
the more than $10 per barrel rise in oil prices since Aug. 2 and
said prospects of a downturn in the future could not be ruled out.
   ``Regrettably, events in the Middle East have introduced new and
substantial risks to the outlook,'' Greenspan said in testimony
before the congressional Joint Economic Committee.
   ``Just the enormous uncertainty about how and when the tensions
in the Persian Gulf will be resolved undoubtedly is affecting the
economy in a negative way,'' Greenspan said in his first comments
on the economy since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Greenspan's appearance today had been eagerly awaited by
financial markets around the world, who were hoping the central
bank chairman would give clues to the future course of interest
rates.
   Greenspan, however, did not signal that the Fed either had eased
credit already or was planning any immediate easing moves. Instead,
he merely repeated comments made in the past that financial markets
would respond favorably to a credible deficit reduction package by
pushing long-term rates, such as mortgage rates, lower and the Fed
would do its part by helping to lower short-term rates. Short-term
rates include variable-rate home equity loans and banks' prime
lending rate.
   Greenspan said that the oil-price rise since August had made
much more difficult the Fed's job of promoting economic growth
while keeping inflation in check.
   The Fed chairman said that if crude oil prices average around
$30 per barrel over the next year, about $10 above the price before
Aug. 2, the higher oil prices would likely lower economic growth by
a full percentage point over a year's time.
   He said that inflation would be boosted by up to 2 percentage
points over the next year. The government reported Tuesday that the
first shock wave from the Persian Gulf had pushed consumer prices
up by 0.8 percent in August and left inflation running at an annual
rate of 6.2 percent so far this year, the fastest clip in nine
years.
   Greenspan said that a $10 per barrel jump in oil prices would
add roughly $30 billion to the country's annual import bill,
draining away purchasing power from consumers and businesses.
   But Greenspan said he was not yet convinced that the country was
headed for a recession because ``the prospects for weakness
cascading throughout the economy do not as yet appear compelling.''
   However, he added later, ``In the final analysis, no one can
guarantee that real growth will proceed smoothly, without a hitch
on a quarter to quarter basis.''
   Some private economists believe that it may already be too late
to avoid the first recession since the steep 1981-82 downturn. The
Bush administration insists that the economy can keep chugging
along, especially if the Fed relents and helps out with a dose of
lower interest rates.
   The need for an easier money policy has been a consistent
administration theme for months, with President Bush firing the
latest salvo Tuesday.
   The president told reporters the best thing the government can
do for the economy is lower interest rates. He noted Greenspan's
indication last week that the Fed would move to cut rates if
Congress and the administration reach a credible agreement to
reduce the federal budget deficit.
   But the budget negotiations are bogged down, making the timing
of any Fed interest rate cut unclear.
   Because of the volatility of events in the Middle East and the
uncertainty over whether there will be a deal to cut the deficit,
many private economists believe the Fed will bide its time,
watching to see how the economy performs in coming weeks.
   ``I think the Fed's frozen in place,'' said David Jones, an
economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. ``A majority of Fed
policy-makers would like to keep policy unchanged while they let
the dust settle on the Middle East explosion.''

   The Irish Republican Army claimed
responsibility today for shooting and gravely wounding the man who
was governor of Gibraltar when British commandos killed three IRA
guerrillas there in 1988.
   The attackers opened fire on Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Terry
and his wife Tuesday night at their home in the village of Milford
near Stafford, 130 miles north of London.
   Terry, 63, was reported in stable condition today following 5{
hours of surgery for injuries including fractures of his right arm
and right leg and severe facial injuries. He also underwent a
tracheotomy, an operation on his windpipe, and was on a ventilator
to aid his breathing.
   Bullets had struck him in the head, hip, stomach, legs and arms,
said surgeon John Lotz. Terry's wife, Lady Betty, suffered an eye
injury.
   The IRA, which is fighting to end British rule in Northern
Ireland, said in a statement in Dublin that such attacks would
continue ``as long as the British government persists in its
illegal and illogical claim to Ireland.''
   Police had launched a major manhunt, using a helicopter,
cordoning off a wide area around the couple's home, setting up
roadblocks and searching nearby countryside with tracker dogs.
   Ballistic and forensic experts scoured the house and surrounding
area.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the attack today as
``cowardly, wicked and evil.''
   The IRA lost three guerrillas in Gibraltar on March 6, 1988 in
an ambush staged by the Special Air Services, an elite
counterinsurgency unit.
   The shooting of Terry came hours after the IRA issued a
statement claiming responsibility for shooting a British army
sergeant in London on Monday, for an explosion at an army
recruiting office in Derby on Sept. 10, and for two thwarted bomb
attacks in August.
   As governor and commander-in-chief of Gibraltar, Terry had
formally authorized the British military to take over the 1988
operation that resulted in the killing of the three unarmed
guerrillas by undercover commandos.
   The IRA said the guerrillas were on active service - a euphemism
for a bombing or shooting mission - when they were gunned down but
said they were given no chance to surrender.
   British authorities at the time of the Gibraltar slayings said
commandos of the Army's Special Air Service regiment killed Mairead
Farrell, Sean Savage and Daniel McCann because they feared they
were about to detonate a car bomb.
   No bomb was found in Gibraltar but two days after the slayings,
Spanish police found a car packed with explosives in the Spanish
resort of Marbella 40 miles northeast of Gibraltar. The car had
been rented by one of the three.
   The jury at a monthlong inquest in Gibraltar decided on a 9-2
vote in September 1988 that the three were lawfully killed. But the
slayings drew criticism from Amnesty International and Prime
Minister Charles Haughey's government in the Republic of Ireland.

   Millions of infant deaths could be prevented
if women in developing nations were able to increase the length of
time between having babies, according to a study released
Wednesday.
   ``Birth intervals of less than two years are strongly and
consistently associated with higher mortality,'' reported the
analysis prepared by the independent Population Crisis Committee.
   When there is less than two years between births, the risk of
the second child dying in infancy is increased by between 60
percent and 70 percent, the study said. And it doubles the chance
of the earlier child dying by age 5.
   ``Family planning should be the first step toward improving
child survival,'' said Sharon L. Camp, vice president of the
committee which advocates provision of contraceptives and family
planning programs.
   ``Through family planning the cycle of weak mothers giving birth
to weak children can be broken,'' said Camp.
   Pregnancy and nursing make major nutritional demands on the
mother. If a new pregnancy follows without enough time to recover
the chances are increased that the second child will be premature
and underweight, the report states.
   In addition, becoming pregnant again quickly can cause a woman
to stop breast feeding the earlier child, the report adds.
   It also suggests that spacing children too closely together
increases competition for limited family resources and may increase
the spread of infectious diseases among children.
   While admitting that accurate statistics are difficult to
collect in many developing nations, the report estimates that 10
million infants and 4 million children aged 1 to 5 die each year.
   About 1.8 million of these deaths could be prevented by
extending the interval between births to two years, the study
estimates.
   That calculation is based on an earlier study that concluded
that a longer interval between births could reduce infant mortality
by 10 percent and mortality in children aged 1 to 5 by 21 percent.
   In addition to birth spacing, the report says that childbirth
before age 20 also increases the likelihood of infant and child
death.
   ``Children born to mothers under age 20 - common in many
developing countries where girls marry very young - are a third
more likely to die before age 5 than children born to mothers aged
25 to 34,'' the report states.
   In addition, the study concludes, infant and child deaths could
be reduced by as many as 3 million annually through the use of
family planning services to delay first births for young women and
to space them out later.

<HEAD>Mayors Say Anti-Drug Funds Not Reaching Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Conference of Mayors urged
Congress Wednesday to pass legislation speeding anti-drug funds to
large cities, saying the money allocated under a bill passed four
years ago is getting bogged down in state and federal
bureaucracies.
   Mayor Robert Isaac of Colorado Springs, president of the
conference, said that in a survey of 30 cities, more than two out
of five said they think they are losing the war on drugs.
   ``The system, as currently designed, is not capable of doing
what it was intended to do,'' Isaac said at a news conference. ``It
is not capable of getting the federal anti-drug funds through the
states to the cities where the drug war is the hottest.''
   He called for approval of legislation providing that cities
eligible for a minimum grant of $50,000 would receive it directly
instead of having it passed through the states. The measure has
been approved by the House Judiciary Committee and is pending as an
amendment to a crime bill.
   Isaac said the survey, conducted in January, showed that city
governments had received only 15 percent of the $150 million
available in the state and local grant program. He said
calculations by the mayors' conference showed they were entitled to
65 percent.
   ``The money was bogged down in the bureaucracies of the federal
and state governments,'' the Colorado mayor said.
   Isaac noted that William Bennett, national drug policy director,
said this month, ``The drug problem in general, nationwide, is no
longer getting worse and in some very significant aspects is now
getting better. Not victory, but success. If we keep pressing the
way we have been pressing, and if we keep our commitments, we will
get where we want to go.''
   In the survey, Isaac said, 41 percent of the cities said that
taking all efforts into consideration they feel they are losing the
war on drugs. Twenty-eight percent said they are winning and most
of the rest ``described a situation somewhere in between,'' he
said.

   The Daily Astorian, Astoria, Ore., on Congress:
   Occasionally we gain a glimpse of what Congress and the federal
government are really up to.
   Remember the Watergate tapes? They were a shock to many
Americans because they revealed a private White House manner that
was much at odds with the public persona (that) President Richard
Nixon had conveyed. Remember the Pentagon Papers? They revealed a

   And now we have a list of epithets that were compiled by a

America. Michael Oreskes revealed the guts of this letter in ...
The New York Times. ...
   Congressman Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) is the prime mover behind the
list. Gingrich's organization, Gopac, even went to the trouble of
testing these epithets with focus groups. The product was 113 words
``that Gopac urges candidates to use to put down their opponents
and to praise themselves.'' ...
   If this is the kind of science practiced on Capitol Hill, is it
any wonder that we have a savings and loan mess? Don't look for

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on NASA's problems:
   Why is NASA in so much trouble?
   Space shuttles that can't blast off, orbital telescopes that
won't focus, a satellite that blacks out around Venus. ...
   NASA isn't the bright young agency it was when ``the race for
space'' put the first men on the moon. ...
   The average age of the scientific staff at the heart of the
agency's operations has grown in the two decades since from 37 to
42, with nearly a third eligible for retirement. ...
   Why has the technical staff become older and, apparently less
vigorous? Perhaps the answer is more interesting than reduced
funding, or bureaucratic inertia, or competitin for talent from
private industry.
   Maybe the vigor is waning because the ``magic'' is gone. There
was a sense of purpose that energized NASA during the space race
years: Moon missions glamorized the agency. ...
   When it stopped going to the moon, perhaps NASA stopped
attracting the best and brightest. The explanation may be that
simple. ...
   If the nation expects NASA to recapture the esprit of its
earlier years, it will require missions worthy of the pride those
years inspired.

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on new TV shows and educators:
   Parents wondering what they can do to help their children in
school this fall might take a look at some of the season's new
sitcoms, the ones aimed directly at young viewers. Parental
guidance is suggested.
   Not that the shows are too mature - heaven forbid. What is
troubling are the images they present of teachers, principals,
students who actually study, and students who make a successful
career out of outwitting the authorities.
   Teachers on these shows are rarely much smarter than their
students, and principals are bullies or pushovers just waiting to
be made into fools. In NBC-TV's ``Ferris Bueller,'' the hero
controls his school with his computers and tapes and reduced his
incompetent principal to a childish rage. ``Hull High,'' also on
NBC-TV, features an empty-headed young teacher given to wearing
skin-tight clothes.
   Is it really funny to see educators belittled and education so
trivialized? Parents might want to take some time to discuss the
content of these shows with their children before or after they
watch them. Better still, why not turn off the TV and read together
instead?

   Kenosha (Wis.) News on back-to-school fashions:
   Some people say there's not much regional variation in American
artifacts and ways. A can of Coke, a pair of jeans, a supermarket
is more or less the same from Maine to Arizona.
   But we read about a fashion that, as far as we know, is unique
to New York City.
   It seems a former city cop is marketing bullet-proof
back-to-school clothes - vests, blazers, T-shirts. Bullet-proof
clip-boards and book bags give added protection.
   Despite high prices - $450 for a jacket - three dozen orders are
already being filled.
   That should not be surprising in a city that recorded 1,905
homicides last year. Four children were shot in an eight-day period
in August.
   But it is certainly grim. May this tragic symbol of urban
barbarism remain a New York oddity.

   Another Berlin wall is coming down, this time

   The wall around Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel's home

   The wall was erected just a few weeks ago. It has since been
painted with the slogans ``Diestel get lost, has no purpose,'' and
``Stasi,'' the name of the notorious former secret police of the
old Communist regime.
   The spokesman dismissed as an ``outright lie'' a news repg

   Pope John Paul II on Wednesday accused the
mass media of being instruments of sin and spreading ``models of
aberrant behavior.''
   ``The situation in which man lives today is marked by a vast and
complex condition of slavery in the moral sphere,'' the pontiff
said in a speech to 4,000 priests attending a spiritual retreat at
the Vatican.
   The pope's comments appeared to reflect his growing concern
about Western models of consumerism and materialism being taken up
by Catholics in the formerly Communist-dominated countries of
Eastern Europe.
   ``The contagious force of bad proposals and examples can avail
itself of the channels of persuasion offered by the varied gamut of
the means of mass communications,'' he said.
   ``In this way models of aberrant behavior become progressively
imposed on public opinion ... A subtle network of psychological
conditioning is thus established which can resemble chains
inhibiting the true freedom of choice.''

   Typhoon Flo thundered through coastal areas of
western Japan Wednesday, leaving 15 people dead, seven missing and
36 people injured, police said.
   No relief was immediately in sight, weather forecasters said.
The typhoon, with winds up to 101 mph, landed late Wednesday in
southwestern Wakayama, 280 miles southwest of Tokyo. Police said
heavy rains caused widespread floods in western Japan and triggered
293 landslides.
   Almost all flights were canceled and land transportation was
nearly paralyzed throughout western Japan as the floods covered
roads and railroads at 186 spots, police said.
   Areas hardest hit included the Kagoshima and Okayama areas,
where up to 12 inches of rainfall was recorded.
   The Central Meteorological Agency issued new flood warnings
Wednesday night in a wide area in central Japan, including Tokyo,
Yokohama and Chiba. Forecasters said Flo was moving northeast at a
speed of 25 mph.

<HEAD>Sununu Gone From New Hampshire, but Political Imprint Remains</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Mass Primary, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ADOLPHE V. BERNOTAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From their earliest days together, John
Sununu and Bill Zeliff were among the insiders offering advice to
George Bush in his New Hampshire presidential primary campaigns.
   From the White House, Sununu endorsed his old friend Zeliff for
Congress, helping him win the GOP nomination in an eight-way
primary last week and provoking the wrath of other Republicans
along the way.
   ``Cronyism and politics ... at its worst,'' complained Dean
Dexter, a businessman and former state representative.
   ``I cannot envision a circumstance where I think John Sununu's
interference in a New Hampshire primary would be appropriate,''
said state Sen. William Johnson.
   Both were among the losers in the GOP primary that Zeliff won by
314 votes. A recount is planned.
   Zeliff sidesteps questions on whether his campaign used the
voting lists, computerized data, volunteers and organizers that
Sununu had begun assembling in his earliest tries for elective
office in the late 1970s.
   ``I used everything at my disposal,'' said the 54-year-old
innkeeper.
   Zeliff made the comments at his campaign headquarters, where his
chief operatives are former Sununu aides from the days when he was
New Hampshire's governor. Sununu now serves as Bush's White House
chief of staff.
   Zeliff served in Sununu's administration on committees to create
jobs through private industry. He says Sununu ``persuaded me to get
involved.''
   Zeliff, who was a fund-raiser for Sununu, said his longtime
friend suggested ``a couple of years ago that I should consider
running for Congress; he thought I would make a good congressman.''
   Zeliff's GOP opponents were angered when Sununu endorsed Zeliff
in a radio commercial that aired in the closing days of the primary
campaign.
   Dexter criticized the endorsement as hypocritical, noting that
Zeliff favors abortion rights while Sununu is opposed.
   Zeliff ``will be a rubber stamp for whatever Sununu and
President Bush want, including higher taxes,'' predicted Larry
Brady, a Washington lobbyist who also was among those defeated by
Zeliff in the GOP primary.
   Zeliff said that on the Friday before the primary, Sununu
``called me and offered, unsolicited, a tape for the campaign
because we're good friends.''
   ``I've known Bill Zeliff for a long time,'' Sununu said in the
ad. ``Nobody will work harder to get the job done.''
   On primary election night, Sununu's attention was focused on the
president's speech to Congress. Nonetheless, the former governor
phoned Zeliff ``to see how we were doing and to wish us luck,''
Zeliff said.
   The White House has not been reluctant to endorse New Hampshire
candidates, giving its blessing to U.S. Rep. Bob Smith's easily won
race in the U.S. Senate primary. Zeliff is running for Smith's
House seat.
   When Smith's opponents and party officials complained that the
White House should have been neutral in the primary, Sununu replied
that he wasn't helping candidates so much as he was ``helping the
process.''
   Although Zeliff denied that his TV advertising program took
lessons from Sununu's strategies in earlier campaigns, the Zeliff
ads had a familiar tone.
   In the 1988 presidential campaign, Bush attacked Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole as a taxer. Zeliff's campaign sounded a similar theme.
   Zeliff labeled House Speaker Doug Scamman a ``broad-based
taxer,'' the unkindest cut one Republican can make against another
in New Hampshire, which has no general sales or personal income
tax.
   The general election campaign against Democrat Joe Keefe will be
an aggressive one, Zeliff predicted.
   ``I'm a conservative Republican businessman, he's a trial
lawyer, a liberal spending Democrat, that's the basic difference,''
said Zeliff.

<HEAD>Iraqis Feel Impact of Sanctions, But Vow Not to Bend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WAFA AMR</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although Iraq is beginning to feel the
impact of economic sanctions, ordinary people in the capital seem
determined to resist outside pressure.
   Bread, powdered milk, sugar, rice, macaroni, chicken and rice
are in short supply. Other food is available, but prices have
skyrocketed since the United Nations imposed the trade sanctions
Aug. 6.
   The sanctions were ordered to force President Saddam Hussein to
withdraw the troops he sent into Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``The West believes we will kneel to their will when they impose
sanctions against us. But we have stored for all our needs,'' said
Salwa Bayati, a mother of two who chatted with neighbors over
morning coffee last week.
   The coffee was served without sugar.
   Iraqi homemakers commonly keep household food storerooms full
and refrigerators stocked, a habit developed during the eight-year
war with Iran.
   Mrs. Bayati said she has enough food on hand to feed her family
for seven months. Sugar, however, was in short supply even before
the trade embargo, and it is one of the items not in her cupboard.
   The Iraqi government has closed all fast-food restaurants and
many pastry shops because they use large amounts of scarce sugar.
Those remaining open bake bread instead of sweets.
   Mrs. Bayati and her neighbors compared living conditions now
with life during the 1980-88 war with Iran. They said more food was
available then, but they still have managed to pile shelves full of
canned goods and pickled food and to load refrigerators with meat
and frozen vegetables, despite government warnings against
hoarding.
   The women said the last war and the current crisis have forced
them to economize. Those at the table included Christeen Yohan, a
German married to an Iraqi man, who has lived in Iraq for 20 years.
   ``Iraqi women are quite capable of overcoming difficulties,''
she said.
   The women said they have taught their children to cope with
difficult conditions.
   ``I believe our children have started to be aware of the war
conditions in which we are living. They understand they cannot get
everything they want,'' said Hana Sabah. The other women agreed.
   ``Today's children are the war generation. They tolerate
conditions other children cannot,'' Mrs. Sabah said.
   Elsewhere in Baghdad, life seems to roll along without much
change.
   Some businesses, like travel agencies and airline offices, have
closed. But people rarely complain. Grumbling is frowned upon by
the Iraqi government, and the ruling Baath Party has a wide network
of neighborhood informers who watch for potential troublemakers.
   ``We hope this crisis ends peacefully, but in the meantime, we
try to live normally,'' said the manager of an Iraqi Airlines
office. He said he has cut the salaries of employees who have
almost nothing to do.
   ``I have two employees who are now taking turns off work,'' he
said. ``This is part of our struggle against Western hegemony, and
we will be patient.''
   Throughout the city, people stood in lone lines outside bakery
shops to get the daily ration of bread. Rationing began Sept. 1.
Loaves are smaller.
   ``We are out of bread today,'' said a waiter in one of Baghdad's
finer restaurants. They were also out of rice. If a customer wanted
tea or coffee, it came black. No sugar or cream.
   In a Baghdad hospital, a doctor said some operations were being
postponed and only emergency cases were treated because surgical
thread, alcohol and other medical items are in short supply.
   The only medicines on pharmacy shelves are drugs bought before
Aug. 2 or those made in Jordan. Prices have increased dramatically.
   Tarik Al Sukooti, a leader of the accountants and auditors
union, said Iraqi people support their president because they
belive he is doing the right thing. He said Westerners do not
understand the Arab mentality.
   ``Iraqi people would rather starve than accept humiliation,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Iowa High Court Backs Sales Tax Exemption for Newspapers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A law applying the state's 4 percent
sales tax to magazines while exempting newspapers was upheld
Wednesday by the Iowa Supreme Court.
   The court found ``no censorial threat, motive, or element''
imposed by the state's tax policy and rejected a constitutional
challenge by the Hearst Corp., publisher of Cosmopolitan, Good
Housekeeping, Popular Mechanics, Harper's Bazaar, Sports Afield and
Town and Country.
   ``The focus is not on the content of the journalism,'' the court
said. ``Rather, the form and frequency of the publication are the
primary factors for determining whether a publication qualifies for
the Iowa sales and use tax exemption.''
   Hearst, based in New York, had argued that the state's tax laws
violated First Amendment guarantees of freedom of the press. Giving
the state the power to tax different publications at different
levels or to exempt some amounts to granting censorship powers, the
company argued.
   Under Iowa tax laws, newspapers do not pay the 4 percent sales
tax that magazines and other periodicals are required to pay.
   Regulations spell out the definitions of ``magazine'' and
``newspaper'' for tax purposes, the most crucial centering around
how often they are published.
   The court conceded that a tax exemption is a government subsidy
but said legislators were within their rights in providing such a
subsidy as long as it doesn't discriminate between similar media
and ``is not impermissibly directed at a publication's content.''
   Hearst also had said the tax policy violated equal protection
provisions, but the court rejected that argument, saying that while
legislators cannot use a taxing power to block press organizations,
they are not required to help them either.
   ``The constitution does not require that the government remove
all obstacles in the path of the exercise of a person's rights,''
said the opinion, written by Justice Bruce Snell. ``Where
government subsidies are not aimed at the suppression of dangerous
ideas, its power to encourage actions deemed to be in the public
interest is necessarily far broader.''
   Hearst also complained that the tax law favored Iowa-based
companies, but the court rejected that, saying newspapers were
exempt from the tax no matter where they were published.

<HEAD>SDI Sensor System Used for First Time to Track Minuteman 3 Missile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unarmed Minuteman 3
missile was launched today and tracked to a Pacific target for the
first time with airborne Strategic Defense Initiative sensors,
military officials said.
   The missile roared off at 1:40 a.m. and its dummy warhead struck
the Kwajalein Atoll missile range in the South Pacific half an hour
and 4,200 miles later, said Maj. Michael Dobel, an Air Force
spokesman in Washington.
   The rocket was tracked by a Boeing 767 equipped with the
``world's most sophisticated infrared equipment,'' said Bill Congo,
chief of external affairs for the Army Strategic Defense Command,
which runs the program.
   ``This is the first time this test has been done,'' Congo said.
``We have tracked stars,, but this is the first time this vehicle
has tracked a live target.''
   The Airborne Surveillance Testbed is designed to determine
whether longwave infrared sensors can give early warning of enemy
missile warheads and track them. The sensor is housed in an
86-foot-long cupola atop the 767.
   Congo said the jet would be flown to Seattle so that data
collected by the SDI machinery can be taken off and analyzed.
   ``We feel very confident about the data collected on this
test,'' Congo said.
   The data should not only provide measurements of the missile's
speed and accuracy but also a picture of what the missile looks
like on radar.
   ``If this was indeed a real warhead, we could track how it looks
on the infrared sensor,'' Congo said.
   The Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missile can carry
three independently targetable warheads. The SDI equipment is
designed to detect incoming warheads to alert defenses while still
hundreds of miles away.
   ``This program will help us to be able to test other sensors in
the future,'' he said. ``This was a special one-of-a-kind thing.
I'm really excited about this.''
   The missile tested today became operational in June 1970. The
launch, one of a series of Strategic Air Command operational tests
of the Minuteman system, was delayed a day by ground equipment
problems, officials said.
   Minuteman 3 missiles are three-stage, solid-fuel ICBMs standing
60 feet tall and weighing 78,000 pounds. They reach a speed of
15,000 mph and have a range of 6,000 miles.

   The bodies of three teen-age boys missing
since Sept. 9 have been found in a remote area of the desert.
   Two bodies were found Sunday in the Hixon Flat area of the San
Bernardino National Forest, and the third was discovered Tuesday
about 15 miles southeast of Hemet, said Riverside County sheriff's
spokeswoman Pat Cruz.
   A coroner's spokesman said the bodies were badly decomposed.
Daytime temperatures in the area have surpassed 100 in recent days,
authorities said.
   The boys' names were withheld pending autopsies, but authorities
have said the three were friends who lived within a mile of each
other in San Jacinto. At the time they disappeared, one was
believed to be giving the others a ride home.
   Beatrice Strother of San Jacinto said her son William, 17, was
one of those found.
   ``He said he'd be back by 10. That was the last time I saw
him,'' she said.
   U.S. Forest Service rangers discovered the body of one of the
boys and a truck registered in his name Sunday on a dirt road, Cruz
said. A second body was found 3 miles to the west and the third was
found about 1{ miles to the east.
   Hemet is about 90 miles east of Los Angeles.

   While U.S. military officers in
Saudi Arabia look for ways to bolster morale, some troops are
finding their own diversions in the desert.
   At the forward base of the 229th Aviation Battalion, the
``Flying Tigers,'' the big attraction is the ``Bengal Kid,'' a
camel spider about as big as a man's hand. The soldiers keep their
leggy pet in a box with a clear plastic kid, which they
periodically lift to deposit other hapless creatures as food.
   The remains of two medium-size beetles attested to the ferocity
of the kid, which at last report was 4-0 with one tie. The other
two victims where a pair of kangaroo rats.
   ``Picked one of 'em up and body-slammed it,'' said Sgt. David
Dean, 24, of Houston, the unit's flight operations non-commissioned
officer and spider fight promoter.
   The kid's one draw was with a scorpion, which not only survived
the encounter but left the spider with one of his eight legs
dangling.

   While some Saudi Arabian troops are supplied daily with hot
meals by helicopter, most of the Americans are living on field
rations, known as MREs, or ``Meals, Ready to Eat.''
   The MREs - pre-packaged main courses, dried fruit to which water
is added, and a variety of other items - have received mixed
reviews.
   Some veteran officers say they preferred the canned
``C-rations'' of Vietnam days.
   ``You throw away a good portion of the MREs,'' said Lt. Col.
Robert Rivers, 44, of Glen Burnie, Md., a Marine Corps artillery
officer. ``All you ever get is peanut butter, and the dried fruit
is terrible.''
   Rumor has it, he said, that the Pentagon is planning to upgrade
the dried fruit. Rivers, who served in Vietnam, remembers that
``C-rats'' had their own drawbacks.
   One was the ham-and-eggs, which nobody liked. The other was the
canned apricots, which everybody liked - until they acquired a
mythical reputation as the ``last meal'' for too many GIs.

   Some of the Arab forces have brought their own comforts to
offset the desert heat and blowing sand.
   Visiting a Syrian camp Tuesday, reporters were greeted by
rugged-looking commandos serving soda and fruit juices on brass and
silver trays.
   Inside the tents, oriental carpets were laid directly on the
sand and visitors sat in padded chairs as they sipped Arab coffee
with a Syrian general.
   At a Royal Saudi Army camp not far away, Tuesday has become
visitors' day. That's when a helicopter flies in extra chow for
lunch.
   This week's catered menu was salad, fried chicken, stuffed
zucchini, rice and a vegetable dish featuring okra.
   ``Come again,'' a Saudi soldier said as reporters walked out of
the tent.

   The influx of foreign journalists - whose number peaked at more
than 500 - has dramatized how journalistic standards vary.
   French, British and other European journalists, especially
photographers and television crews, are unabashed about ``set-up''
pictures, which their U.S. colleagues generally avoid.
   Some recent examples of events staged for the benefit of the
cameras: Egyptian troops goose-stepping for the cameras, Syrians
rushing forward shouting ``One Arab Nation!'' in unison, a fake
``patient'' being loaded into an ambulance for a Danish
photographer.
   Two French photographers, seeing a Kuwaiti soldier resting
against a flagpole, induced him to strike a more dramatic pose by
leaning back to gaze upward at his country's flag.
   ``With nothing going on, they're basically trying to make
something out of nothing. The question is how desperate are they
going to get?'' said an American magazine photographer.

   The U.S. forces aren't above ``dog and pony shows'' for the
media, but they aren't consistent either.
   After pestering the Marines for permission to cover the first
live-firing of tanks and artillery, U.S. journalists were annoyed
to learn, a day late, that the exercise had taken place with no
cameras or print reporters present.
   But when a U.S. television crew visited the ammunition ship USS

   Pat Costello, writer and producer of
television's ``Abbott &amp; Costello Show'' and brother of the late
comedian Lou Costello, has died. He was 87.
   Costello died at his suburban Encino home Thursday of heart
failure, his wife said Tuesday.
   Born on Dec. 10, 1902, in Paterson, N.J., Anthony S. Cristillo
served with the Navy in World War I before starting his
entertainment career under the name Pat Costello in New York City.
   He played saxophone for band leader Paul Whiteman, then returned
to Paterson with his own 10-piece band, Pat Costello's Gondoliers,
and a theme song called ``Neapolitan Nights.''
   When Lou Costello and Bud Abbott moved to California in 1939 to
make their first major film, ``Buck Privates,'' he went along to
work as a stunt double for his younger brother.
   During the 1940s, he wrote for ``The Camel Show,'' a weekly NBC
radio program starring the popular comedy team. He later wrote and
produced the ``Abbott &amp; Costello Show'' for television in 1951 and
1952.
   He retired from the entertainment business after his brother's
death in 1959.
   In addition to his wife, Marty, he is survived by a daughter,
Susan Dowding, of Los Angeles.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will visit Spain
and Portugal later this week for talks with those countries'
defense ministers and other senior government officials, the
Pentagon said Wednesday.
   Cheney will leave Washington on Thursday and return on Sunday.
   He had been scheduled to visit Spain and Portugal in July as
part of a European tour but cut short that trip to return to
Washington for urgent budget talks.
   The Pentagon released no details of the subjects Cheney plans to
discuss in Spain and Portugal, both members of the NATO alliance.
   Separately, Cheney announced that President Bush nominated Adm.
Charles R. Larson as commander of the U.S. Pacific Command. He
currently is commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.
   Also, Cheney said Bush nominated Vice Adm. Robert J. Kelly for
promotion to admiral and assignment as Larson's successor as
commander of U.S. Pacific Fleet. Kelly currently is deputy chief of
naval operations for plans, policy and operations.

   Those who otherwise might miss the blast of
the ram's horn that marks the celebration of the Jewish new year
can hear the call on a recording set up by a suburban Detroit
synagogue.
   The blowing of the shofar is a high point in the celebration of
the two-day holiday of Rosh Hashana, which begins at sunset today.
Congregation Shir Tikvah in Troy wanted to do something to include
shut-ins in the holiday.
   Two years ago, the synagogue started Dial-A-Shofar. Callers to a
special number can hear a brief tape that includes the sound of the
traditional horn being played.
   ``Every year, shut-ins tell us how much they appreciate this,''
said Rabbi Arnie Sleutelberg. ``Jews have an obligation to hear the
shofar.It's a call to repentance, to action, to do justice, to
assembly.''
   A shofar also can be made from the horns of an antelope.
   Rosh Hashana marks the beginning of a period of self-examination
and repentance that ends with the fast day of Yom Kippur that
begins at sunset Sept. 28.

   Barring unforeseen calamities, the Jewish New
Year is looking happier than usual for Israel.
   The caveat about calamities is necessary.
   When Jews celebrate, they traditionally smash a glass to remind
themselves there is no joy without sorrow. And with each puff of
good fortune, Israelis listen for the tinkle of broken glass.
   The Persian Gulf crisis, the rapid thaw in Israel's relations
with Moscow and the influx of Soviet Jewish immigrants are forcing
Israelis to confront the unimaginable. The sands of the Middle East
haven't just shifted. They have quaked.
   ``The horizon that has opened up is unlimited and we're playing
for the whole kitty,'' says Amnon Abramovitz, a columnist for the
Maariv newspaper.
   ``We're at a junction of several roads, and it's hard to know
right now what road we'll be taking this year. It could lead to
negotiations with Syria, or a war with Saddam Hussein, or both,''
he said.
   Israel's steadfast, low-profile conduct in the gulf crisis has
transformed its image from bully of the West Bank to loyal ally of
the West, and relieved the pressure on Jerusalem to negotiate with
the Palestinians.
   Still Israelis worry: What if Iraq attacks them with chemical
weapons? There was panic buying of survival supplies last month,
and a debate is raging about whether to distribute gas masks.
   Soviet Jewish newcomers kissing the Tarmac at Ben-Gurion Airport
are a heart-warming spectacle for Israelis - a reminder of why they
built a Jewish state.
   But can a small, troubled economy pay to house and employ an
immigrant multitude that may increase the Jewish population by 50
percent by the mid-1990s?
   ``It is a most revolutionary thing,'' says immigration official
Simcha Dinitz. ``I know of no other society going through such a
massive absorption process.''
   Many of Israel's 7,000 synagogues opened to immigrants free,
following a request by Minister of Religious Affairs Avner Shaki to
waive the fees that some synagogues impose to raise funds for
religious work.
   The new year, 5751 on the Jewish calendar, was welcomed with the
blowing of the ram's horn known as the shofar and begins 10 days of
introspection which culminate in Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.
   According to figures released Wednesday by the Central Bureau of
Statistics, Israel's Jewish population grew by 3.9 percent since
last Rosh Hashana. Of the 115,000 new immigrants, 88 percent were
from the Soviet Union.
   State-owned radio reports a nearly 10 percent unemployment rate.
   The intefadeh, the 34-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, has slowed sharply, but no
Israeli imagines it is over.
   ``Once the dust has settled, when the gulf has calmed down,
there will still be two peoples left in this country - two people
whose lives will become hell unless the conflict between them is
solved by peaceful means,'' warned Peace Now, a grass-roots Israeli
movement, in a New Year message.
   Still, as they take to the synagogues, beaches and picnic
grounds for a long weekend starting Wednesday night, many Israelis
will agree with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's assessment that
``we had a great year and we're entering an even greater one.''
   Most extraordinary is the turnaround by the Soviets, who had
armed the Arabs, denounced Zionism as Nazism and persecuted
would-be Jewish emigrants. The Soviets now line up with the United
States against Iraq and entertained Israeli ministers in the
Kremlin.
   Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai and Science Minister Yuval Neeman
on Saturday became the first Israeli Cabinet ministers to meet a
Soviet leader.
   Asked how he felt as he walked into the Kremlin to meet
Gorbachev, 64-year-old Modai replied in awe-struck tones not heard
from Israeli politicians since Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
landed in Israel 13 years ago.
   ``You can't even imagine. It was so dramatic. It was so out of
anything that any normal human mind can conceive, that I don't
think anybody who hasn't gone through it can imagine it.
   ``We were frozen there on our seats. You sit across from
Gorbachev. You can touch him. You look at his face and that famous
mark. And you (are able to) read his mind, not just to listen to
him,'' he said.
   A year ago, Iraq was a distant threat. Jordan looked like
Israel's most peaceful and responsible neighbor, and Syria, as
ever, was Israel's implacable foe.
   Now Jordan is drifting into Iraq's embrace and readmitting the
Palestine Liberation Organization leaders it expelled 20 years ago,
while Syria sends troops to join the Western buildup in the gulf.
   And now that the Soviets no longer guarantee to bankroll Syria's
army, some Israelis are speculating about a tradeoff involving the
Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. A year ago the notion of peace with
Syria would have been laughed off. Now the Jewish settlers on the
northern Golan Heights are calling emergency meetings to discuss
the prospect of an Israeli withdrawal.
   In Saudi Arabia, the U.S. military staged private srvices
Wednesday for Jewish troops wishing to mark the holiday despite
Saudi restrictions on overt practice of any religion other than
Islam.
   ``All these things simply make you lose your bearings,'' says
Amnon Dankner, a writer and columnist for the daily Hadashot.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein today seized all foreign assets
from countries honoring the embargo on trade with his nation, just
days before the U.N. Security Council was expected to toughen its
sanctions.
   In Washington, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned
that the 6-week-old crisis in the Persian Gulf had introduced ``new
and substantial risks'' for the prospects of continued growth of
the U.S. economy.
   ``Just the enormous uncertainty about how and when the tensions
in the Persian Gulf will be resolved undoubtedly is affecting the
economy in a negative way,'' Greenspan told the congressional Joint
Economic Committee.
   And in more troubling economic news, a leading oil industry
group said today that U.S. petroleum imports rose 4.1 percent in
August compared with a year ago, while U.S. crude oil production
dropped 4.8 percent.
   In an effort to cripple the Iraqi economy, nine West European
countries on Tuesday endorsed a proposed United Nations air
blockade, and Argentina said it was joining the multinational
flotilla enforcing the naval blockade of Iraq.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said he feared
the gulf military standoff brought on by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait could turn into World War III.
   In other developments today:
   -A U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways plane carrying 416 mostly
American women and children from Kuwait left Baghdad for London,
officials said.
   -In Washington, the House of Representatives approved a nearly
$1 billion package to assist the U.S. military buildup in the gulf.
   -The chairman of the KGB offered to give the CIA intelligence
about Iraq, where the Soviet government still has about 5,000
specialists.
   -Defense Secretary Dick Cheney asked Congress to let the
Pentagon accept and spend billions of dollars in allied
contributions for military operations in the Persian Gulf without
prior approval from Capitol Hill.
   -An Army paratrooper suffered a superficial leg wound when
struck by shrapnel from a misguided artillery shell in live-fire
exercises by U.S. forces in the Saudi desert. He was treated at the
scene and remained with his unit.
   -A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said Iraqi soldiers
arrested two Frenchmen this week in Kuwait. They join about 60
other French citizens - and thousands of other foreigners - held
hostage in Iraq and Kuwait.
   -Iraq offered to pump free oil to Turkey through two pipelines
Ankara closed last month, a spokesman for Turkey's Foreign Ministry
said. The government has made no decision on the offer, which was
similar to one Iraq made to Third World countries last week.
   -Jordan's King Hussein flew to the Moroccan capital, Rabat, for
a summit with Moroccan and Algerian leaders that Hussein hopes will
work out a joint blueprint on solving the Persian Gulf crisis.
Before leaving, Hussein conferred with Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat.
   -The flow of Kuwaitis into Saudi Arabia slowed, four days after
Iraq allowed citizens to flee. Only about 30 cars passed through
the Khafji border crossing.
   In Baghdad, the Iraqi government said today it has seized all
cash deposits and property of governments, companies and banks -
private and government-owned - from countries that are honoring the
U.N.-ordered embargo.
   The state-run Iraqi News Agency said the ruling Revolutionary
Command Council ordered the confiscation under a new seven-article
law dealing with the protection of ``Iraqi interests, money and
rights in Iraq and abroad.''
   INA did not mention how much money was involved. The U.S. State
Department was unable to say how much the American assets seized by
Iraq were worth.
   ``It is not clear from the Iraqi statement in what form or
against whom the action will be taken,'' State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   ``In any case, actions like this can only make it more difficult
for Iraq to return to the international community of nations and to
restore economic relations which are crucial for Iraq's long-term
development,'' she said in Washington. ``The clear way for Iraq to
protect its interests is to comply with the Security Council
resolutions relating to its invasion of Kuwait.''
   The United States and other countries already have frozen Iraq's
foreign holdings. Kuwait's foreign assets, estimated at about $100
billion, have been turned over to the the country's exiled leaders.
   ``The Treasury Department is reviewing the situation to
determine the specifics,'' a spokesperson said, adding that the
Treasury would not be able to determine the extent of private
property involved until it receives claims from the private sector.
   The Revolutionary Command Council is Iraq's highest
policy-making body, headed by Saddam. An official Iraqi newspaper
reported Tuesday that a member of the council, 51-year-old Saadoun
Shaker, had quit for health reasons, leaving seven members on the
panel. It gave no details on his illness.
   Appeals for an air blockade to make the U.N.-ordered trade
embargo as airtight as possible grew stronger after Iraqi troops
raided several Western diplomatic compounds in Kuwait last week.
   In New York, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov said
he expected the U.N. Security Council to approve the embargo this
week.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said today in Hungary that the
five permanent members of the Security Council - the United States,
Soviet Union, Britain, France and China - have agreed to impose the
air embargo. She said the vote probably would not come before
Friday.
   Under the resolution, all countries would have to close their
airspace to planes approaching or leaving Iraq or occupied Kuwait.
   On Sunday, the 15-member Security Council passed its seventh
resolution condemning Iraq, denouncing the violation of diplomatic
privileges displayed in Friday's embassy raids.
   Under the next resolution, sources said, only flights carrying
refugees out of Iraq or Kuwait, or bringing in medical supplies and
food specifically authorized by the Security Council would be
allowed to travel to those nations.
   Planes could not be shot down under the proposed resolution;
that is banned by the 1944 international civil aviation convention.
But they could be challenged.
   The United States has backed the U.N. action with force.
   Since the Iraqi invasion Washington has sent about 165,000
troops to the Persian Gulf region, most of them dug into the Saudi
desert, to head a growing multinational force. More American GIs
and heavy tanks are on the way.
   The Pentagon said Tuesday that Iraq over the past two weeks has
built up its troop strength in and near Kuwait to 360,000. The
Pentagon's last estimate two weeks ago was 265,000.
   In Jerusalem on Tuesday, Israel Television reported that the
United States has agreed to supply Israel with advanced F-15 jet
fighters and Patriot missile batteries. It also is also considering
new Israeli requests for a special grant of $1 billion in military
aid, TV and state radio said. Defense Minister Moshe Arens declined
to comment on the reports.

<HEAD>Report: Student Sorting Harmful to Minority Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Rand Corp. study indicates black
and Hispanic students are falling behind in math and science
because school districts are more likely to put them in classes for
those with lower skills.
   Such student sorting, according to the report released Tuesday,
narrows the opportunity of low-income and inner-city blacks and
Hispanics to learn science and math.
   Additionally, those students have fewer materials and
less-qualified teachers, the nationwide study concluded.
   ``Our analyses reveal clear and consistent patterns of unequal
opportunities to learn mathematics and science,'' said Jeannie
Oakes, principal author of the report and a professor of education
at the University of California, Los Angeles.
   Rand surveyed 1,200 public and private schools and questioned
6,000 teachers nationwide to come up with its 132-page
``Multiplying Inequalities'' report.
   The so-called tracking method sorts students into classes based
on their academic abilities. But Rand researchers said ethnicity
too often plays a role in class placement.
   For example, 28 percent of the curriculum at elementary schools
where minority students make up most or all of the population
consisted of low-ability math and science courses, the report
showed.
   At schools where 90 percent to 100 percent of the students were
non-minorities, only 7 percent of the classes were on the slow
track.
   The researchers also found that junior and senior high schools
with a large concentration of non-minority students were seven
times more likely to be high-track than their heavily minority
counterparts.
   ``Even if objective ability groupings appear logical, they are
easily confounded with race and social class. Moreover, the
differences in opportunities they provide actually limit
instruction rather than fine tune it,'' the study said.
   The tracking system should be eliminated, researchers concluded,
and some educators agreed.
   ``Philosophically, we don't believe in it. The best mix is to
have low- and high-ability students together so they can learn from
each other,'' said Richard Thome, director of elementary education
for the Capistrano Unified School District in Orange County.
   The study, funded by the National Science Foundation, was
carried out by researchers at the Santa Monica-based Rand Corp., a
private think tank engaged in research and analysis of national
security and domestic welfare issues.

   The Senate Judiciary Committee today completed
its hearings on Supreme Court nominee David Souter after hearing a
black lawyer friend vouch for the judge's sensitivity to the plight
of minorities.
   ``I think he is fundamentally fair, lacking in prejudice,'' said
Wesley Williams Jr., a Washington attorney whose friendship with
Souter extends back to their days at Harvard College and Harvard
Law School.
   During his three days of testimony, Souter had portrayed his
home state of New Hampshire as free from discrimination. The
statements generated concern from some panel members and criticism
from other witnesses.
   ``This is an insensitive man that you are foisting upon us,''
complained Joseph Rauh, general counsel to the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights, who pointed to examples f racism in
the state.
   But Williams said today that ``David Souter understands. He has
lived in the world'' and seen the trouble in the minority
community. ``I think he's prepared to do the right thing,'' he
said.
   Williams' testimony, like that of the nominee himself, appeared
aimed at calming liberals who fear Souter will swing the court's
majority firmly to the right. But while reassuring the liberals,
the testimony has aroused doubts among conservatives.
   ``The concern is that Judge Souter is a man of empty philosophy
... all things to all people,'' Bruce Fein, a conservative court
analyst, said Tuesday.
   Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, said in
testimony today that Souter ``lacked moral courage'' because he
didn't declare himself against abortion at the hearing or years
earlier when he sat on a hospital board that voted to permit
abortions at its facility.
   Souter testified for three days before the committee, finishing
Monday night. The committee was expected to conclude its hearings
today and vote on the nomination before the end of the month.
   Committee chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., said the committee vote
on the nomination could be as early as next week. The panel's next
regularly scheduled business meeting is Sept. 27.
   The panel spent Tuesday hearing from other witnesses with
opinions on whether the 51-year-old New Hampshire jurist should
join the nation's highest court.
   Many longtime acquaintances of Souter urged his approval. But
civil rights, women's groups and those supporting the right to
abortion said they oppose him despite his expressions of
open-mindedness on the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that legalized
abortion.
   President Bush has called for overturning that decision, but his
nominee declined to take a position before the committee despite
repeated attempts to get him to do so by senators on both sides of
the issue.
   Souter also avoided taking stances on other issues and declined
to criticize other controversial court decisions of the last few
decades.
   But he raised conservatives' eyebrows when he voiced support for
affirmative action, praised retired liberal Justice William J.
Brennan, and talked of filling a legal ``vacuum'' when other
branches of government don't act - the judicial activism that
conservatives oppose.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a committee member actively supporting
the nomination, said some fellow conservatives inside and outside
the Senate are worried. But, he said, ``only the real far-right
wing people are getting physically unnerved.''
   Hatch said Souter was a shrewd witness before ``a very difficult
group to play to.'' Some may be mistaking Souter's genial
personality as being soft on issues, he said.
   ``He may be more influential than anybody thinks'' once he joins
the court because of his ability to work with both sides, Hatch
said. ``He just may be the glue that binds on that court.''
   Despite the concerns, Hatch said he doubted any Senate
conservatives would vote against the nominee.
   Thomas Jipping, court watcher at the conservative Coalitions for
America, said some conservatives were disappointed because Souter
apparently has no political agenda.
   ``Conservatives as well as liberals want others to do their work
for them,'' he said. Souter is ``the kind of conservative judge
that means conservatives are going to have to do more work,'' he
said.
   Fein said his concern was that ``Judge Souter is a man who is
complacent with the legal status quo. He could not think of a
single Supreme Court decision which was wrongly decided.''
   Fein predicted Souter would join the court as the moderate he
portrayed himself to be. ``The savin grace,'' he said, is that
``the intellectual brainpower on the court is on the conservative
side'' and eventually may win him over.

<HEAD>Oil-Supply Fears Fuel New Attack on Gas Guzzlers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's gas-guzzling cars are under the
heaviest attack in more than a decade as the Mideast crisis brings
home the country's reliance on foreign oil.
   And Detroit is shuddering.
   Thursday, the Senate is expected to take up a bill that would
require automakers to produce cars with an average gas mileage of
40 miles per gallon.
   The bill was once given scant chance, but industry lobbyists and
members of the Bush administration now say they're concerned the
measure may sneak through as Congress searches for a response to
the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   The spotlight shining once more on efficient cars could not have
caught automakers at a worse time. For years, they have been
increasingly pushing performance over gasoline savings.
   As the bill's prospects have risen, so have the voices on both
sides of the issue.
   ``It should be called the highway fatality bill,''
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner told a news conference
called so he could denounce the legislation. If passed, he said,
the measure would lead to smaller cars and more traffic deaths.
   Skinner said the ``near hysteria'' over the Mideast situation
may propel the legislation through Congress even though, he
insisted, the mileage goals are ``unrealistic, irresponsible and,
more important, unattainable.'' He said he would urge President
Bush to veto the bill if it reaches his desk.
   But environmentalists say Skinner is being taken in by the
automakers, who repeatedly have said they lack the technology to
improve fuel efficiency dramatically after years of making cars
lighter, smaller and more efficient.
   Since 1975, the average fuel economy of cars sold in the United
States has doubled, from about 14 mpg to 28 mpg. A third of all
models now get more than 30 mpg.
   Further improvements in automakers' fleet-wide average, the
manufacturers say, would mean restricting buyers to compacts.
   ``We're at a different plateau now than we were in 1975,'' says
Albert Slechter, government affairs director for Chrysler Corp.
Fifteen years ago, he acknowledges, cars were too heavy; engines
were too big; cars weren't designed to save gas.
   Such technologies as improved aerodynamic design, front-wheel
drive, improved transmissions, fuel injection and smaller, more
efficient engines are already being used in many cars without
approaching the 40 mpg level of performance, the automakers argue.
   ``There is no secret or magic technology on the shelf to
drastically increase fuel economy,'' argues Thomas Hanna, president
of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, hich is
spearheading the fight against the Senate bill.
   Not true, argues Sen. Richard Bryan, the Nevada Democrat who is
the architect of the bill. Earlier this year, he touted the
legislation as a way to deal with global warming; now, he says,
concerns over dependence on imported oil are giving the measure its
momentum.
   Bryan has accumulated his own folder of studies that he says
show clearly cars can meet his bill's requirements - if automakers
are told that's what they have to do. He scoffs at suggestions that
cars would have to become much smaller, calling the claims scare
tactics.
   The studies cited by Bryan contend there are changes in
transmissions, tires, engine designs and fuel injection systems -
as well as improved aerodynamics - that could significantly improve
fuel economy and maintain a selection of car sizes.
   Deborah Lynn Bleviss, executive director of the International
Institute for Energy Conservation, says manufacturers have
developed a half dozen prototypes that average 60 to 75 mpg. She
contends they demonstrate the ``technological potential'' for
dramatically more fuel-efficient cars.
   Environmentalists accuse the automakers of pushing
high-performance, ``muscle'' cars and contend the vehement
opposition to higher fuel-economy standards stems from the millions
of dollars already invested in future production plans for such
cars.
   Detroit's 1991 model line includes several high-performance
models weighing more than two tons. One is General Motors' Buick
Roadmaster. Its V-8 engine gets 16 miles to the gallon in city
driving.
   ``It's hard for me to believe that any patriotic American would
buy a Roadmaster with American boys sitting in the desert,''
snapped Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., during a recent debate on
fuel economy at a House hearing.
   ``The companies are working flat out to improve fuel
efficiency,'' says Hanna of the trade association. He says that if
the Bryan bill becomes law it ``would have economic disaster'' as
automakers scramble to retool production lines.
   Supporters of Bryan's bill say they are unimpressed by the
complaints from Detroit, noting that automakers have fought other
proposed fuel-economy regulations only to find ways to comply.
   Bryan argues that the nation cannot significantly ease its
dependence on foreign oil without improving automobile fuel
efficiency. He cites conservationists' estimate that a 40-mpg fleet
average could save 2.4 million barrels of oil a day.
   Last week, the Senate easily overrode efforts by Sen. Donald
Riegle, D-Mich., to prevent the measure from being considered.
   ``The vote was the first step to remove the oil weapon from the
hands of Saddam Hussein,'' declared Daniel Becker of the Sierra
Club.
   And in the House, Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., sponsor of
similar legislation, is trying to take her bill directly to the
floor, sidestepping the Energy and Commerce Committee, whose
chairman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., has made no secret of his
distaste for the legislation.

   Soviet officials eager to copy American-style,
single-family houses are getting some tips from U.S. housing
experts: learn from America's mistakes. Don't waste timber
resources by failing to make the most out of every tree.
   ``They have some of the largest and highest quality timber
stands in the world, but they're not applying the proper technology
to use it effectively,'' said Leonard Sylk of Shelter Systems
Group, a New Jersey company that manufactures roofs, walls and
floors.
   ``It's a chance to learn from our mistakes. It wasn't until most
of our timber industry was used up and gone that we got smart about
using it,'' Sylk said.
   Americans now use about 93 percent of each log taken; the
Russians are making use of only about 55 percent, Sylk said.
   He said an example of their ignorance of new engineering
techniques was their use of 12-inch lumber where 4-inch lumber
would work.
   Sylk was one of 15 chiefs of American corporations dispatched to
the Soviet Union last week by President Bush.
   The delegation, led by Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, met
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other officials to
explore how the United States could help the Soviets move toward a
market economy and improve oil production, housing, transportation
and agriculture techniques.
   Oil is the Soviets' top priority because it's the country's main
source of hard currency. Increasing its production - and the
revenues that flow from it - would free up more money for the
country's ailing roads and railroad system, housing and
agricultural advancements.
   Still, the Soviets' needs run the gamut of industries, the
businessmen said, and U.S. technology could help make dramatic
improvements in many areas. For instance:
   -Soviets are unfamiliar with new oil drilling techniques that
shorten by more than a year the time it takes to drill a
16,000-foot well, said Chesley Pruet, the owner of an El Dorado,
Ark., oil company who made the trip. The Soviets are spending 500
days to drill such a well; the same task takes U.S. oilmen less
than 100 days, Pruet said.
   -The Soviets could benefit from a common practice in the U.S.
poultry industry: spiking chicken feed with lysine, an amino acid
made easily from sugar beet molasses, to promote growth. That could
help boost Soviet production from 500 million birds a year to 3
billion, said Dwayne Andreas, chairman of Archer-Daniels-Midland
Co.
   -A lack of grain storage and drying equipment at Soviet farms
results in huge losses and an inability to save crops for
year-round distribution. ``They're losing nearly 30 percent of
their crops to rodents and rotting deterioration,'' Andreas said.
   The Soviets are so eager to improve their standard of living
they don't realize how much catching up they have to do, Sylk said.
The Soviets don't want to see progress ``in a year or two, they
want it in a couple of weeks.''
   They tend to forget that Americans spent decades experimenting
with technology and investing in roads, bridges, sewer and water
systems - all the support systems needed to ensure that factories
run smoothly and there's a way to transport and distribute goods,
the U.S. businessmen said.
   ``They want that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow but they
haven't prepared for it. They read these Western magazines and want
what we have, but they don't know what went in to achieve it,''
Sylk said.
   During the trip, the Soviets pledged to pass an emigration law
that would remove obstacles to U.S. trade. The Soviets also said
they were considering a historic first - allowing foreigners 100
percent ownership of Soviet plants and factories.
   Gorbachev told the U.S. businessmen that the Soviets might act
soon to allow Western investors to buy ``whole existing
enterprises,'' or any of a number of different kinds of businesses,
such as fabricating or aluminum plants, Andreas said.
   The theory goes that Western investors would pump money, new
equipment and technology into the facilities to make them
profitable, proving lucrative for both the investor and the
Soviets.
   Allowing foreigners 100 percent ownership of Soviet facilities
would be a ``mammoth step,'' Andreas said. ``It could multiply many
times over the investment that we make over there.''
   However, the U.S. businessmen noted that barriers remain - such
as the emigration reforms - which make Americans leery of jumping
in wholeheartedly.
   ``The message we got across the board was they're interested in
American investment. But until they finish their voting and
parliament and we see whether there'll be any central government
left, there'll still be some question marks about how much money
anyone will invest,'' said H. Leighton Steward, chairman of the
Louisiana Land and Exploration Co. of New Orleans.

<HEAD>Voters Show Anti-Government Sentiment in Primaries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oklahoma voters enacted the nation's first
sweeping limit on how long politicians can hold elective office,
but in Massachusetts they did it the old fashioned way and threw
them out.
   In a primary election that was reminiscent of the French
Revolution, heads rolled at all levels of the Massachusetts ballot.
   ``A lot of voters have been very angry for a long time and they
finally got a chance to go to the ballot and say so,'' said Ralph
Whitehead, analyst at the University of Massachusetts.
   In the Democratic primary, John Silber easily defeated former
Attorney General Francis Bellotti for the nomination to succeed
Gov. Michael Dukakis. Silber, on leave as president of Boston
University, ran as the anti-establishment candidate.
   Winning the Republican gubernatorial nomination was former U.S.
Attorney William Weld, who also ran an outsider's campaign against
state House Republican Leader Steven Pierce.
   Candidates all the way down the ballot who held elective office
were defeated, including Attorney General James Shannon, who said
he was swept away by a political ``tidal wave.''
   A certain kiss of death was close association with Dukakis. In
Silber, Democrats nominated a candidate who admitted without
hesitation that he voted for Republican George Bush in the 1988
presidential election.
   But is that anger a nationwide phenomenon that will sweep
incumbents from office this November?
   The anti-establishment sentiment, said analyst William
Schneider, ``is a very potent theme. It's out there. It may be
stronger in Mssachusetts than elsewhere, but with the economic
downturn, it's going to catch on elsewhere, too.''
   A prevailing theory is that 1990 will be a tough year for
incumbents as voters, concerned about the economy and angry over
the savings and loan scandals, are attracted to new faces.
   But until this week, incumbents generally had survived
challenges.
   An exception was in the District of Columbia, where Democrats
nominated Sharon Pratt Dixon for mayor, the clear outsider in a
five-candidate field. The result was widely considered a protest by
an electorate angered by the city's crime and financial problems,
as well as by Mayor Marion Barry's legal difficulties.
   How deep that anger runs may be seen in November when Barry, who
was convicted on a cocaine possession charge, is on the ballot as
an independent candidate for the city council.
   But elsewhere, endangered incumbents withstood challenges. Just
a week ago, Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota swept past a Democratic
primary opponent who polls had once shown running even with the
governor. In Maryland, congressman Roy Dyson easily topped three
Democratic challengers despite a solid year of bad publicity,
including the recent disclosure that the hawkish congressman had
been a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War.
   The results from Massachusetts and Oklahoma seemed to blow away
any complacency on the part of incumbents.
   By a 2-to-1 margin, Oklahoma voters approved a constitutional
amendment placing a 12-year lifetime limit on state legislative
service, the first state to do so, but probably not the last.
   Similar proposals will be on the November ballot in California
and Colorado and additional proposals have been introduced in New
York and Florida.
   Oklahoma voters also backed the outsiders in the primaries for
governor, giving the nod to David Walters over veteran congressman
Wes Watkins for the Democratic nomination and for Bill Price over
Vince Orza in the GOP balloting. Orza had the backing of Republican
Gov. Henry Bellmon, who is retiring.
   Even in Washington state, for no clear reason, voters threw the
chief justice of the state Supreme Court out of office in favor of
an unknown challenger who never campaigned.
   Charles Johnson, who defeated Chief Justice Keith Callow, said
he entered the race ``because nobody ever runs against these guys
and I think people want somebody else to vote for.''
   Observers of the electoral purge in Massachusetts cautioned that
the level of voter anger in that state was not likely to be seen
elsewhere.
   ``There is a sense of betrayal here,'' said Schneider, who is on
the faculty at Boston College. ``Michael Dukakis ran for president
on the Massachusetts Miracle and it's a lie. They feel lied to,
they feel betrayed by the whole political establishment.''
   ``It's virulent up here to a level that is probably not quite as
true in other places,'' said Steve Grossman, a Massachusetts
businessman who is a member of the Democratic National Committee.
   Political activist Ann Lewis said the results signal ``the
growing irrelevance of party.'' She said the Massachusetts results
were ``not a referendum on liberal versus conservative. It was a
referendum on the ins versus the outs.''

<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is dropping a
bribery charge against a dead man and is asking that his $110,000
bail be turned over to his estate. But it's still seeking back
taxes from him.
   The IRS had questioned whether Ehsanolla Motaghed had actually
died and said it was considering digging up his grave for proof.
But a court document filed in August indicated the government had
dropped exhumation plans.
   At a hearing Tuesday, attorneys for both sides told a magistrate
they agreed to dismiss a charge that Motaghed paid a $4,000 bribe
to an IRS agent.
   They also said they agreed that Motaghed's bond be turned over
to his daughter.
   Meantime, the IRS filed $156,337 in liens against the estate of
Motaghed, who imported optical lenses. The IRS claims Motaghed owed
that amount in personal income taxes for 1985-87.
   ``The axiom `The only things that are certain are death and
taxes' applies to civilians, but in the mind of the IRS the only
thing that is certain is taxes. Death is irrelevant,'' said
Motaghed's attorney, James Martin Davis.
   According to a death certificate, Motaghed died June 9 at age 66
from the effects of Lou Gehrig's disease.

   American troops eager for entertainment in the
blazing sands of Saudi Arabia will have to wait a little longer.
   A planned tour by comedian Steve Martin to entertain U.S. troops
has been postponed by at least 10 days to allow the forces more
time for their military duties, an official said Wednesday.
   Martin was scheduled to head for Saudi Arabia at the start of
October but he won't go before Oct. 15, said Kevin McCarthy,
Executive Producer of the United Service Organization (USO).
   The private non-profit group has signed up Martin and other
celebrities to entertain the more than 150,000 American soldiers,
sailors and airmen deployed in the Persian Gulf area.
   ``We've been told they're (the military) not ready,'' said
McCarthy.
   He said USO was ready to send its staff and entertainers to
Saudi Arabia immediately, but it also understands that logistical
considerations come first.
   Defense officials originally planned to have all U.S. troops and
equipment in Saudi Arabia by Oct. 1, but delays have been reported
in the massive operation.
   In a related development, Marine Commandant Gen. Al Gray issued
a statement saying that while he doesn't object to entertainment
for his troops in Saudi Arabia, it's too soon to start such
programs.
   A spokesman issued the statement to clarify remarks Gray made
Tuesday in which he said it was inappropriate to send entertainers
to Saudi Arabia.
   The remarks caused concern at USO, which contacted the
Commandant's office and received a clarification of his comments to
reporters at Camp LeJeune, N.C.
   ``The majority of Marines have been there less than a month and
they still have much to do to prepare themselves to carry out the
tasks assigned,'' said Gray's spokesman, Lt. Col. Fred Peck.
   ``With the Marines still digging in and preparing defenses
against a possible Iraqi attack, that's where our focus must be.
Anything else detracts from the mission.''
   But once ``things settle down a little bit,'' Gray would be
happy to have USO entertainers in Saudi Arabia, Peck said.

<HEAD>Council Halts Meetings Over Disagreement on Chairman Post</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Talks among Cambodia's warring factions
collapsed Wednesday over disagreements on how to bring rebel leader
Prince Norodom Sihanouk onto a council seeking to end 11 years of
civil war.
   The factions accused each other of sabotaging the Supreme
National Council, formed last week to join members of the
Vietnamese-installed government and the three-party guerrilla
coalition.
   The 12-seat council held its opening session Monday at the
Cambodian Embassy in Bangkok. Progress quickly stalled when the
government side refused guerrilla demands that Sihanouk be the
council's 13th member and its chairman.
   ``We have not been able to reach any agreement at all,''
Cambodian Premier Hun Sen told a news conference before leaving for
home Wednesday. But he called it ``only a temporary adjournment.''
   The council, established under a U.N.-drafted peace plan, has
six seats for the government and two spots for each of the three
rebel factions. The plan also allows for a 13th seat for a
chairman.
   The rebel coalition includes the non-Communist forces of
Sihanouk and former Cambodian premier Son Sann, who have been
backed by Washington, and the Chinese-backed Communist Khmer Rouge.
   Ek Sereywath, a spokesman for Sihanouk, expressed optimism the
dispute would be settled before the Oct. 18 deadline for Cambodia's
new credentials to the U.N. General Assembly. The Supreme National
Council is supposed to replace the rebel resistance in the U.N.
seat.
   ``Hun Sen wants to go to the U.N. and he will compromise,'' Ek
said.
   Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan said the issue must be settled
so that the Paris international conference on Cambodia can be
recovened. The 19-nation conference ended last year after failing
to reach a peace plan.
   The guerrillas say Sihanouk must be chairman because only he was
accepted by all parties and could bring about national
reconciliation and implement the U.N. plan. The plan was adopted
last month by the five permanent members of the Security Council:
the United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.
   But Hun Sen said Sihanouk could be chairman if he replaced
someone already on the council and if the 13th seat went to the
government's side. If Sihanouk joined as the 13th member, the
government said it also must have another member.
   A Khmer Rouge statement claimed the government's position was an
attempt ``to prolong the war in Cambodia.''
   Sihanouk said from his Beijing home that he was ill and could
not go to Bangkok. His son and chief representative, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, left for Paris on Tuesday after attending the first
session of the council.
   ``When Ranariddh left, it all fell apart. The Khmer Rouge took
over the meeting,'' said a Thai official who demanded anonymity.
``We got a call from Prince Sihanouk in Beijing who said he would
agree to anything the Khmer Rouge wanted.''
   The U.N. plan proposes the council would cede much of its power
to a U.N. interim authority and peacekeeping force until free
elections. U.N. officials have said up to 20,000 troops and
civilian personnel could be sent to Cambodia to monitor the
transition.
   The Cambodian war began with Vietnam's invasion in late 1978,
which ended four years of Khmer Rouge rule. The Khmer Rouge tried
to transform the nation into a radical agrarian society, resulting
in the deaths of nearly 1 million people.

   Rizzo, who ruled City Hall from 1972-80 but failed in two

   The Democratic and Republican parties can claim
near-equal numbers of Texans for the first time this century,
according to a newspaper poll.
   The poll results show growth of the Republican Party and a
decline for the Democratic Party in Texas, said University of
Houston political scientist Richard Murray, who conducted the poll
for the Houston Chronicle.
   In the most recent study, 34 percent of those questioned said
they think of themselves as Democrats, 33 percent as Republicans
and 33 percent said they were independent. The percentages were
rounded off.
   ``The Republican Party clearly has reached parity with the
Democrats,'' Murray said.
   A year ago, a poll by Murray showed Democrats with 33 percent
and Republicans with 28 percent of voters questioned. Another
survey by Texas A&amp;M University showed the parties virtually even,
with Democrats at 32 percent and Republicans at 31 percent.
   That's compared with a survey in September 1986 showing
Democrats with 38 percent and Republicans with 23 percent.,
   And in August 1978, when the University of Houston first
included party affiliation questions in its polls, Democrats drew
48 percent and Republicans 14 percent.
   The latest survey was conducted Sept. 5-12 among 1,042 Texas
voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

   Treasurer Joan Finney says she believes the
governor's race is hers to lose, given her leads in two polls made
public so far.
   ``The main thing we have to guard against is over-confidence,''
Mrs. Finney told reporters Tuesday night.
   Two media polls in the past two weeks have given Mrs. Finney
leads of 13 and 18 points over incumbent Republican Gov. Mike
Hayden. That advantage follows her upset victory over former
Democratic Gov. John Carlin in the Aug. 7 primary election.
   She has agreed to just three joint appearances with Hayden. One
was Sept. 8 at the State Fair in Hutchinson and two more will be
televised, on Oct. 20 and Nov. 4, which is just two days ahead of
the general election.
   She said Kansas ``is in trouble fiscally and socially,'' and she
promised to take steps if elected to put the state on a sounder
financial basis and to attack drug, crime and education problems.
   Asked by reporters where she would cut $200 million from the
state budget, as she has said she will do, she replied, ``I'll get
with you later on that.''
   However, she said the cuts would not come in the areas of
education or social programs.

<TEXT>
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the only
Communist leader to survive politically after democratic
revolutions swept the East bloc, told Parliament on Wednesday he
will resign early to help Poland complete its transition to
democracy.
   Jaruzelski's announcement came amid increased calls for his
resignation to make way for a popularly chosen head of state.
   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa has already declared his
candidacy for president, and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki,
Walesa's former adviser and ally, also is considering running.
   As Communist Party leader in 1981, Jaruzelski imposed martial
law but peacefully transferred power to a Solidarity-led government
eight years later. He was named president by parliament in July
1989 for a six-year term.
   Jaruzelski sent a letter Wednesday to the Sejm, or lower house
of parliament, asking it to name a date for ending his term.
   Jaruzelski announced his planned resignation after a six-hour
meeting at which the nation's feuding political leaders agreed in
principle to hold early elections for both the presidency and
parliament. No date was set for what would be post-Communist
Poland's first fully democratic elections for president and
parliament.
   The current parliament was elected in Jun 1989, but 65 percent
of the seats were guaranteed to the now-dissolved Communists and
their allies.
   The president wants parliament ``to enable him to transfer the
office he holds to a president chosen in a general election,'' a
Jaruzelski spokesman said in a statement.
   Jaruzelski is ``concerned about preventing unnecessary social
emotions and willing to develop democracy,'' according to the
statement, carried by the official PAP news agency.
   Elections are expected as early as this fall and no later than
spring.
   Participants in a meeting Tuesday suggested that Jaruzelski
should resign no later than Dec. 13, the ninth anniversary of the
day he declared martial law to crush the Solidarity movement,
according to sources contacted by the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper.
   Jaruzelski's election as president in 1989 came about with some
support from Solidarity parliament members. It was meant to
guarantee good relations with the Soviet Union in the first months
of Poland's democratic reforms.
   But the arrangement was overtaken by events. After Mazowiecki's
Solidarity-led government took power in September, revolutions
swept through the East bloc, toppling neighboring Communist
leaders. The Polish party itself dissolved in January.
   On Monday, police draggged away two dozen demonstrators of the
Confederation for Independent Poland who attempted to block the
Belweder Palace, where Jaruzelski has his office.
   The protesters chanted ``Jaruzelski must go!'' and affixed
posters with the caption ``Already too long'' to the palace's iron
gates. They derided the police as ``Soviet servants.'' Some
protesters were detained briefly.
   A petition demanding the president's resignation was launched
recently by the Center Alliance, a political group formed to back
Walesa for president.
   The 67-year-old Jaruzelski, who often appears remote behind his
dark glasses, remains a complex figure in Poland's political life.
Responsible for among the most traumatic events in modern Polish
history - Walesa and Mazowiecki were among thousands imprisoned by
the military government - he also is the only Communist leader in
the East bloc to retain office after democratic governments took
over.
   Although technically empowered as president to run the army, the
police and the nation's foreign policy, Jaruzelski has taken a
back-seat role and never interfered with the Solidarity-led
overhaul of Poland's government and economy.
   Born to a landed-gentry family in an eastern Polish village, he
was attending a Catholic boarding school in Warsaw when World War
II broke out.
   His official biography says he ``stayed'' in the northeastern
territories of the Soviet Union working as a laborer during the
war. But Poles who knew his family have said they were caught by
the invading Soviet army and deported to Siberia, where
Jaruzelski's father felled logs in a forced labor camp until his
death.
   In 1943, Jaruzelski entered a Soviet officer training school and
then served with the Communist-led Polish First Army, which
advanced with the Red Army against the Nazis.
   He joined the Polish Communist Party in 1947, rising through the
ranks until he was appointed defense minister in 1968, then the
youngest of the East bloc's top military chiefs.
   In 1981, as Poland was being rocked by the defiance of Eastern
Europe's only legal independent trade union, Jaruzelski was named
first secretary of the Communist Party - the only career military
officer to rise to supreme power in the East bloc.
   Although he has spoken of the ``very painful'' decision to
impose martial law, he has never repudiated the declaration.

   Politics and personal life coincided for U.S. Rep.
Joseph P. Kennedy II as he filed for divorce the same day he sailed
unopposed through the primary election.
   The Democrat is seeking a third term representing Massachusetts'
8th Congressional District, which includes parts of Boston and
Cambridge.
   He faces Republican Glenn W. Fiscus in the fall election.
   On Tuesday, Kennedy and his wife, Sheila Rauch, filed for a
no-fault divorce in Suffolk Probate Court, the judge's clerk said
Wednesday.
   A settlement and financial statement submitted with the divorce
papers were sealed by the judge, said the clerk, who declined to
give her name.
   Kennedy, 37, and his wife, 40, separated in February 1989. They
have twin 9-year-old sons.
   Kennedy is the oldest of the 11 children of Sen. Robert Kennedy,
who was assassinated in Los Angeles in 1968 after winning the
California primary in his bid for president.

   WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) - Paul Newman has donated $50,000 in
profits from his food company to help refugees who are stranded in
Jordan after fleeing Kuwait and Iraq.
   Newman, who donates all profits from his food company, Newman's
Own Inc., to charitable and educational purposes, gave the money to
Westport-based Save the Children, the company announced Tuesday.
   Save the Children was working to assist 75,000 refugees who have
fled Iraq and Kuwait and are stuck in makeshift desert camps in
Jordan.
   ``Mr. Newman's generous contribution will literally save lives;
the situation is that dire,'' said Jim Busch, president of Save the
Children. ``We need the support of other humanitarian individuals
and we need it quickly in order to avert a very real catastrophe.''
   The money will go toward air freight charges to move supplies
from the United States to Jordan, the purchase of additional relief
supplies in Europe and the Middle East and the transportation of
refugees from the camps to Amman, Jordan.

   TULARE, Calif. (AP) - Crystal Gayle may cut her famous
ankle-length hair because it can be a pain in the neck. Literally.
   Pressure from her hair's extreme length gives her headaches and
neck aches, the country-western singing star said before performing
Tuesday with her sister, Loretta Lynn, at the Tulare County Fair.
   It also takes an extraordinarily long time to wash and dry -
five hours before her performance Tuesday. She lets her hair dry
naturally instead of using a blow dryer.
   ``The worst part is combing it out,'' she said.
   Her hair was down to the ground for her prformance, but she had
it up earlier in the day for convenience.
   ``It was catching on every knob in the trailer,'' Gayle said.
``It's like wearing a gown.''

   MACON, Ga. (AP) - Good golly Miss Molly! Little Richard is going
to be on the road for a long time!
   The Macon City Council voted Tuesday to name a road after its
local hero.
   The Little Richard Penniman Boulevard beat other suggestions to
honor the flamboyant rocker, such as ``Tutti Frutti,'' one of the
singer's biggest hits.
   Little Richard Penniman Boulevard had been known as simply the
``downtown connector.'' Penniman is Little Richard's surname,
which, after some debate, the council decided to include in the
street name.

   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - The International Museum of Photography
is honoring the sultry-voiced Lauren Bacall with an award for her
illustrious film career.
   Bacall will be given the George Eastman Award ``for
distinguished achievement in American film'' at a fund-raising gala
at the George Eastman House Nov. 9.
   Previous recipients of the award include Gregory Peck, James
Stewart and Lillian Gish.
   ``Miss Bacall reflects the unanimous decision of the award
committee and of the museum board, and represents the dimensions
the award honors, in both the quality and depth of her work,'' said
Eastman House director James Enyeart.
   Bacall, who was born Betty Joan Perske, began her career in the
1940s in the movie ``To Have and Have Not'' with Humphrey Bogart.
Her come-on in that film to Bogart, who became her husband, has
become movie legend.
   ``If you want anything, just whistle,'' Bacall's character coyly
intones. ``You know how to whistle, don't you Steve? Just put your
lips together ... and blow.''
   Bacall starred with Bogart in ``The Big Sleep,'' ``Dark
Passage,'' and ``Key Largo.'' In 1970, she won a Tony award for her
stage performance in the musical ``Applause.'' More recently she
played roles in ``Murder on the Orient Express,'' ``The Shootist''
and ``The Fan.''

   SUN CITY, Ariz. (AP) - The Highwaymen - country music stars
Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson
- arrived at their concert with more than 80 tons of food in tow to
give to the area's needy.
   ``We waste food in this country,'' Jennings said.
   Jennings and his wife, singer-songwriter Jessi Colter, praised
the hunger-relief organization Feed the Children in collecting the
food and urged concertgoers to donate more canned goods.
   The produce, canned goods, cookies and potatoes loaded on four
tractor-trailer trucks are being distributed to more than 50 area
churches, food banks, shelters and other organizations.
   The food distributed by Feed the Children, a program run by the
Oklahoma City-based Larry Jones International Ministries Inc.,
comes from corporate and private donations.
   The Highwaymen, who played Tuesday night at the Sun Dome,
collected canned goods for the organization at each stop of the
group's 18-city tour of the West and Southwest.
   Colter said 1.5 million pounds of food has been distributed so
far during the tour.

   Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait are torturing
and executing Kuwaitis, seizing youths for possible drafting and
restructuring the very face of Kuwait to make it more a part of
Iraq, according to refugees.
   Soldiers are searching house to house for Westerners and have
turned Kuwait City's Embassy Row into an armed camp, surrounding
Western missions with tanks and leveling their cannons at them, the
escapees say.
   Iraqi authorities have even banned dawn prayers in Kuwait as
they come before the end of the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m curfew.
   Tales of the once-stable emirate now plunged into fear and chaos
continued to emerge as refugees squeezed through a border
checkpoint into Saudi Arabia six weeks after Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein sent in his army, overrunning and annexing Kuwait.
   The Iraqis are out ``to demolish anything that has to do with
Kuwait,'' renaming streets, hospitals and other institutions and
buildings so that ``it is all becoming Iraqi,'' said one man
interviewed at the border who identified himself only as a
professional worker.
   Another escapee interviewed in Manama, Bahrain, who said he was
a state technocrat, said the Iraqis renamed the Al-Sabah Hospital
as Saddam Hospital, and were taking apart a traffic circle in
Kuwait City opposite the Sheraton Hotel to put up a life-size
statue of Saddam in its place.
   On the Kuwaiti side of the 1.2-mile-wide no man's land near the
border crossing at Khafji, northeastern Saudi Arabia, Iraqi
soldiers were confiscating papers that identified anyone as a
Kuwaiti, refugees said.
   ``I want the world to know that the Iraqis threatened to take my
9-month-old baby boy from the lap of his mother at the border post
if we would not give them our passports, all our identification
papers including car registration,'' said the man who said he was a
professional worker.
   ``They insisted they take every document, anything that bears
the name of Kuwait,'' he said.
   It was unclear why the soldiers were confiscating the passports
and other documents, but refugees speculated it was so Iraq could
send spies or terrorists abroad on forged papers, or just to keep
Kuwaitis out.
   Several refugees told of summary executions of Kuwaitis in the
streets by Iraqi soldiers. Soldiers also seized young men trying to
flee their homeland and stopped Asian housemaids trying to cross
into Saudi Arabia.
   Most of the household workers in oil-rich Kuwait were Asian, and
the refugees said they believed the Iraqis might be preparing to
pressure developing nations to drop support for U.N. sanctions.
   Several Kuwaiti refugees said soldiers were demanding that the
servants be brought back to Kuwait City or left to fend for
themselves at the roadside.
   ``They gave no explanations, and no argument would help despite
the tears and the screaming,'' one refugee said.
   While the number of Westerners in Kuwait has been reduced
because Saddam allowed thousands of women and children to leave,
hundreds of thousands of Asians remain, mainly in miserable
condition as they await their governments to help release them.
   The Indian government Wednesday said it had dispatched two ships
to pick up as many as 2,500 refugees from Iraq and Kuwait. So far,
India has evacuated 48,575 of its nationals since the Aug. 2 Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait. About 175,000 Indians were in Kuwait and 10,000
were in Iraq when the crisis erupted.
   ``The entire population of Kuwait, including third-country
nationals, is being subjected to a reign of terror, systematically
planned and relentlessly pursued by the Iraqi occupiers,'' the
Kuwaiti ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Abulhasan, said
in a letter to the U.N. secretary-general Monday.
   Iraqi ``criminal practices are being stepped up with the
sinister objective of making life under occupation so intolerable
that the population is forced out, in order to alter the
demographics of Kuwait,'' Abulhasan said. Many ``are being
subjected to all sorts of intimidation and physical torture.''

<HEAD>Rinfret Campaign Broke; Candidate May Stop Stumping</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sputtering New York gubernatorial effort
of Republican Pierre Rinfret ground to a near halt Wednesday as the
Manhattan-based economist admitted his campaign was broke.
   A top Rinfret aide said there was ``a strong possibility'' the
candidate would cease active campaigning. And Rinfret's campaign
manager announced that he was ``no longer part of the campaign.''
   Rinfret, making his first run for public office, is waging an
underdog campaign against Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo. He was
recruited to run by top New York party officials after other
Republicans refused to take on Cuomo.
   John Denny, Rinfret's deputy campaign manager, said the
candidate was ``absolutely discouraged'' by what he perceived as a
failure by New York Republicans to support him financially.
   At a private fund-raiser on Tuesday, Rinfret said that ``the way
it's going, we cannot win,'' the New York Daily News reported
Wednesday. ``We're blowing it.''
   An independent statewide poll released this week had Cuomo as
the choice of 60 percent of those surveyed while less than 15
percent backed Rinfret.
   ``Our financial situation is so desperate that I'm probably
going to have to shut down our entire operation this Friday,''
Rinfret wrote to key GOP leaders in a letter dated Tuesday.
   Denny said Wednesday that closing down the campaign operation
Friday remained ``an option.''
   While there was no direct plea by Rinfret in the letter for
funds, Republican leaders interpreted it as such and scurried to
control the damage from Rinfret's public disclosure of campaign
problems.
   ``It's in all of our interests ... to help our gubernatorial
candidate and we intend to help him to the extent we can,'' said
John McArdle, a spokesman for state Senate Majority Leader Ralph
Marino.
   Meanwhile, state Assemblyman John Faso, who had been serving as
Rinfret's campaign manager, issued a statement saying he was ``no
longer part of the campaign.''
   ``It has been mutually decided that the campaign would take a
different direction,'' said Faso. Faso's statement said he would
continue to support Rinfret, but he could not be reached for
further comment.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, at a campaign stop in suburban
Buffalo on Wednesday, said Rinfret ``told me last night that he was
in this for the future.'' He did not elaborate.
   Cuomo has reported having about $8 million on hand for his
campaign while Rinfret has reported raising about $900,000,
including a $500,000 loan from himself.
   Thus far, the GOP candidate's campaign has drawn more attention
for his controversial off-the-cuff comments than for his campaign
positions.
   Most recently, Rinfret on Friday called federal Housing
Secretary Jack Kemp ``a traitor to the Republican Party'' and ``a
lackey for Governor Cuomo.''
   Rinfret said Republican Kemp had gone back on a promise to stage
a fund-raiser for Rinfret in the Buffalo area. Kemp aides said no
such promise was ever made.

   A new era in Massachusetts politics began
Wednesday, launched by an eruption of voter anti-establishment
sentiment that almost no one saw coming.
   Voters frustrated with the utter collapse of what Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis had termed the Massachusetts economic miracle in his
ques for the presidency, turned out in record numbers to vent
their wrath on almost any politician associated with the Democratic
old guard.
   The only thing the back-pedaling experts will now say is that
the turmoil is likely to continue in the general election.
   ``The boil hasn't been lanced and the issue is alive and well,
and will be in November,'' said Marty Linsky, lecturer at Harvard's
John F. Kennedy School of Government and a former Republican
legislator. ``There are a lot of people who are going to walk in
and say `This is a little irresponsible what I'm doing maybe, but
I've got to shake this thing up.'''
   The primary beneficiary of the discontent was Boston University
President John Silber, a tough-talking native Texan running for
governor. Last week, pundits dismissed his candidacy after Silber
uttered what seemed to be a disastrous 11th-hour ``shocker,'' the
label given to Silber's frequent provocative comments. This time it
was about a minority neighborhood.
   The pre-primary favorite among Democrats, former state Attorney
General Francis X. Bellotti, who served during the Dukakis era, was
said to be leading by as much as 10 percent.
   But with 98 percent of the vote counted among the more than 1.4
million cast, it was Silber with 545,447 votes to Bellotti's
446,265. On the Republican side, former U.S. Attorney William Weld
defeated House Minority Leader Steven Pierce, the leader in the
polls until shortly before the primary.
   ``It is about as angry as it gets. The pollsters have never seen
this level of anger,'' said Lou DiNatale, a public policy professor
at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. ``There's
anti-incumbency fever out there.''
   At a Democratic breakfast Wednesday, Silber sounded the theme of
revolt. ``We do not come before voters as the old Democratic Party.
We have been through a watershed experience,'' he said.
   The voter mood should even raise red flags for Democratic
stalwarts like Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was unopposed in the
primary, but who now faces GOP competition in November.
   ``The notion of the public being angry is there, and it's being
directed at virtually anything which smacks of traditional
politics,'' said Paul Watanabe, head of the political science
department at U-Mass. ``That assuredly is something to raise
concerns all up and down the ballot.''
   The primary also saw the defeat of the state House Speaker in
the Democratic primary for treasurer, and of incumbent Attorney
General James Shannon, whose loss to Middlesex County District
Attorney Scott Harshbarger reportedly marked the first primary
defeat of an incumbent attorney general.
   Massachusetts' Legislature has been dominated by Democrats since
the 1950s. Its top elected offices have been held by a block of
Democrats since the early 1970s. The past eight years under Dukakis
saw the creation of liberal programs fueled by a booming economy.
   President Bush already has pledged to do what he can to help
ensure that a Republican replaces his old rival.
   Silber will be teamed with the feisty Marjorie Clapprood, a
state representative, and they will present a campaign duo
distinctly different from Dukakis and Evelyn Murphy, both reserved
technocrats.
   Murphy dropped out of the primary after her failed ``coup'' to
attack the state's fiscal problems while Dukakis was out of the
state.
   Clapprood's consistently liberal agenda might seem to put her at
odds with Silber. But she has a personality big enough to match
Silber's, and she promised to work as a team, referring to the new
ticket as the ``yin-yang'' of the party.
   The victories of Silber over Bellotti and Weld over Pierce were
both upsets for the party establishments. With 98 percent of the
vote counted, Weld took 261,150 votes, or 60 percent, to Pierce's
173,146.
   ``Under the Democrats who have controlled our state government
for the past several years, Massachusetts has lost its way,'' Weld
said. He blasted politicians who ``see taxpayers as a limitless
source of cash with which to feather their own nests or fund their
latest experiments.''
   Bellotti and Pierce had won the endorsements of their party.
Silber was generally shunned by Democrats aligned with Dukakis.
Weld's stands favoring abortion rights and distribution of condoms
in public schools under some circumstances failed to endear him to
GOP conservatives.
   Silber said the promise of change he raised in the primary would
continue to be the theme of his general election race.
   Weld, a Boston Brahmin who quit the Justice Department over his
displeasure with reports about the personal finances of his boss,
Edwin Meese, won through a combination of personal campaigning,
aggressive debate performances and a contribution of more than $1
million from his own checkrm rates, such as mortgage
rates, lower and the Fed would do its part by helping to lower
short-term rates.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., said
that Greenspan's testimony signaled new Fed concerns about a
possible steep downward slide in the dollar if the Fed pushed
interest rates lower at a time when other countries were raising
their rates to fight inflation.
   ``This was a major departure. He emphasized strongly the dangers
in a declining dollar. It means he will delay any easing steps,''
Jones said.
   The Fed chairman said that if crude oil prices average around
$30 per barrel over the next year, about $10 above the price before
Aug. 2, the higher oil prices would likely lower economic growth by
a full percentage point over a year's time while boosting the
inflation rate by up to 2 percentage points.
   A Fed report released Wednesday on conditions in various parts
of the country emphasized the weak economy. The report, known as
the ``beige book,'' said economic activity in the Fed's 12 regions
was either expanding more slowly at present or actually declining.
   ``Weakness is most apparent in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic
districts,'' the report said.
   Asked about the regional disparities during his testimony,
Greenspan said that clearly the East Coast was in worse shape at
present than the West Coast.

   A fire raced through a wooden boarding
house for the elderly early Wednesday, killing four people,
officials said. But a teen-ager was credited with saving 10 others
by desperately dragging them to safety.
   ``I went to the back of the house, where the four people
perished, but the heat and fire were too much,'' said Shawn Bates,
16. ``I thank God for the people I got out and I wish I could have
done more for the other people.''
   Bates, a high school junior and football player, said he ran
from room to room carrying and dragging people out, but was unable
to reach the last four people.
   The fire was reported at Wilson's, a one-story wooden boarding
home for the elderly and infirm, around 2:30 a.m., said Capt.
Richard Davis of the Bessemer Fire Department.
   When firefighters arrived, Bates already had rescued 10 of the
15 residents and one woman had escaped on her own.
   ``Of the four fatalities, two were in wheelchairs and all four
were invalids,'' Davis said.
   Bates, who sleeps in the boarding house and whose parents live
next door, said a fire alarm alerted him to the blaze and when he
ran out of his room, he found the fire had been started by an
elderly man smoking on a couch.
   Bates said the man fought with him, but he managed to drag him
and another man from the building. Then, he said, ``I went in
people's De Klerk spoke after meeting with his Cabinet on further
measures to halt the township violence.
   He said special units led by deputy attorneys general would
investigate four incidents: a police shooting this month that
killed 11 people in the Sebokeng township, two attacks on train
stations in Johannesburg that killed more than 30 people, and an
alleged ambush that killed a policeman.
   The president also said he was considering appointing an
indpendent investigator to handle allegations of misconduct by
``government institutions, organizations or by individuals.''
   Much of the fighting has pitted Xhosas and other blacks linked
to the ANC against Zulus loyal to the conservative Inkatha
movement. ANC and other black leaders have accused police of
favoring Inkatha, and called for a purge of right-wing elements
from security forces.
   There was no immediate ANC response to de Klerk's announcement.
   Inkatha and the ANC oppose apartheid but differ on tactics and
plans for a future South Africa. Their power struggle in the
eastern province of Natal has claimed about 5,000 lives since 1986.
   De Klerk spoke a day after the government announced plans to
prosecute Winnie Mandela, the wife of Nelson Mandela, on charges of
kidnapping and assault for the 1988 abduction and beating of four
young men. Her prosecution could harm the ANC-government
negotiations.
   Mrs. Mandela said Wednesday she was detained by police for about
three hours after handing over spent cartridges from an assault
rifle given to her by residents of the Tokoza township. She accused
police of harassing her and her husband.
   ``The whole idea really is to undermine the ANC,'' she said.
   The ANC said it ``condemns the harassment meted out to Mrs.
Winnie Mandela'' by police ``intent on curbing the normal activity
of the ANC.''
   Mrs. Mandela was traveling in her white Mercedes Benz through
the Tokoza township when she was stopped at a police roadblock.
``Mrs. Mandela apparently picked up the shells while visiting,''
said police spokeswoman Capt. Ida van Zweel. ``She handed them to a
policeman. There is no crime involved.''
   In the 1988 incident, four young men were abducted and beaten at
Mrs. Mandela's house, according to court testimony.
   One of them was killed, and the head of Mrs. Mandela's former
bodyguard unit, Jerry Richardson, has been convicted of murder,
kidnapping and assault. The three survivors testified Mrs. Mandela
beat them with a whip. She has denied wrongdoing.
   Mrs. Mandela faces four counts of kidnapping and four counts of
assault and is expected to be formally charged Monday.
   ``I welcome the decision in the sense it will give me the chance
to clear my name ... after this trial by media,'' she said.
   If convicted on all counts, Mrs. Mandela's punishment could
range from a suspended sentence to the death penalty. Prosecutors
said no one has ever been executed for kidnapping or assault in
South Africa.
   Also Wednesday, police used rubber bullets and tear gas to
disperse about 200 students at the University of the Witwatersrand
protesting alleged police bias in the recent township violence.
   Mervyn Shear, vice-chancellor of the university in downtown
Johannesburg, was hit in the hip by a rubber bullet but was not
seriously hurt, his office said. Police said the protest was
illegal.

<TEXT>
   Rank-and-file members of Congress began
deserting party leaders over the stalled budget summit Wednesday,
saying it is time to abandon the talks and let lawmakers fight it
out over their fiscal priorities.
   ``There is very little sentiment for continuing on this path for
summit meetings that go nowhere,'' said Rep. Richard Durbin,
D-Ill., after a closed-door meeting at which many of the 257 House
Democrats complained about the budget standoff.
   ``We think they should junk the budget summit,'' said Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind. ``We weren't elected to sit around and wait. We were
elected to do the job.''
   The complaints came as Congress' five highest-ranking leaders
and three top administration officials met for a second day in the
Capitol in hopes of finding their way to a deficit-reduction deal.
   The goal is to put together a collection of new taxes and
spending cuts that will cut the budget gap by $50 billion next year
and $500 billion over the next five years. The two sides,
stalemated over the budget all year, on Monday ended 10 days of
talks at nearby Andrews Air Force Base.
   The rank-and-file impatience was fueled by impending, drastic
cuts in federal spending under the Gramm-Rudman law. When the new
fiscal year starts Oct. 1, the law, in the absence of specific
cuts, will automatically trim the $1.2 trillion federal budget by
about $100 billion.
   As the deadline neared, Democrats and Republicans began
separately piecing together budgets reflecting each party's
spending and tax goals.
   Burton and others said they could balance the budget within
seven years, increasing spending for all programs by 4 percent
annually but not raising taxes.
   Some Democrats were talking of a plan to raise taxes on the
wealthy while relying on deeper defense cuts but shallower
reductions in domestic programs that are likely to emerge from the
budget negotiations.
   ``If we sat down with some discussions, we could have a
significant deficit-reduction package with broad support on the
Democratic side,'' said Rep. Martin Olav Sabo, D-Minn.
   Congressional leaders, meanwhile, expressed optimism that the
bipartisan negotiations would eventually produce a compromise.
   ``It's wrong to suggest it's such a polarizing thing that we
can't get an agreement,'' said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash.
   But the leaders conceded that with the Gramm-Rudman cuts about
to be imposed, lawmakers have to be prepared to act.
   ``If we can't come to an agreement, we can't just sit back,''
said the House Budget Committee chairman, Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif.
   Some lawmakers expressed a willingness to use the Gramm-Rudman
cuts to put political pressure on the other side, with many
Democrats saying they could convince the public that such cuts
would be the result of Republican insistence on tax breaks for the
wealthy.
   ``If they've got to suffer that pain for a little while, it's
okay with me,'' said the House Ways and Means Committee chairman,
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   But the No. 2 House Republican, Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia,
said the public would blame such a spending cuts on the Democrats.
   ``I think 48 hours of sequester will help solve the problem,''
he said, using the technical name for the Gramm-Rudman reductions.
   Democrats have said the budget talks have stalled because
Republicans insist the capital gains tax rate must be reduced to
stimulate the economy. Democrats oppose the cut, which they say
would mainly benefit wealthy property owners.
   Republicans say they want deeper cuts in domestic programs than
Democrats are willing to accept. They also oppose some Democratic
tax proposals, such as their plan to raise energy taxes by $49
billion over the next five years.

   The U.S. military staged private
services Wednesday for Jewish troops wishing to mark the high
holiday of Rosh Hashana in the land of Islam's most holy sites.
   Officially, Islam is the only religion allowed in Saudi Arabia.
But Saudi government officials said they had no objections to the
services as long as they were confined to the military camps.
   Military officials refused to provide details of the services or
allow media coverage.
   Islam recognizes Judaism and Christianity. But the Saudis,
guardians of the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina, prohibit
practicing and proselytizing faiths other than Islam.
   ``Our personnel, whether Jewish, Christian and any other faith,
are free to practice their religion as long as they do so in a
discreet manner,'' according to a one-page U.S. military memo.
``This is the only restriction placed on the practice of religion
in Saudi Arabia and is equally applicable to all non-Islamic
religions.''
   Christian services have been led by military chaplains since the
early days of the American deployment. Those also have been off
limits to media.
   Initially, U.S. military officials offered to bring Jewish
troops to a ship offshore or to neighboring Bahrain for traditional
sundown services, according to sources who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
   But commanders decided to arrange small services in camps where
requested, the sources said.
   Rosh Hashana, marking the Jewish new year, began at sundown
Wednesday.
   A Saudi diplomatic official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
conceded some Saudis may object to a Jewish ceremony in their
nation but said there was no religious basis for such complaints.
   Islam's Koran refers to Jews as ``people of the book,'' meaning
the Old Testament, and Judaism and Islam share many dietary rules.
   But there also have periods of strain between the two religions,
particularly because of the Zionist movement in Israel.

   While voters in Massachusetts and
Washington state were busy tossing incumbents out of office,
Oklahomans were planting a time bomb. It goes off in another 12
years unless voters decide to defuse it.
   A ballot measure that passed overwhelmingly Tuesday limits
legislators to a lifetime maximum of 12 years in office. One
veteran legislator said Wednesday that the measure let people take
out their frustrations on a faceless target.
   ``People always are upset with the Legislature as the `they,'
but they like their own legislator,'' said state Sen. Gene Stipe, a
Democrat who has been in the Legislature since 1949 with only one
four-year break in service. ``This was a chance to strike out at
the rascals, and they took it.''
   Still, Stipe said: ``The sky is not going to fall. This will not
take effect for 12 years. The pendulum of public opinion swings
back and the people generally right any wrong they have done.''
   The constitutional amendment becomes effective Jan. 1, but
legislators now in office may serve 12 more years.
   It was the second time in three years the voters had acted to
put a crimp on legislative activities. They adopted another
amendment in 1988 that sharply limited the time the Legislature
could be in session.
   Oklahomans also decided on their nominees for governor in close
Democratic and Republican runoffs.
   David Walters, the 1986 Democratic nominee, won another shot at
the governor's office and former U.S. Attorney Bill Price defeated
restaurateur Vince Orza in a strong comeback from the August
Republican primary.
   Orza had led the ticket in the primary with 40 percent of the
vote to 27 percent for Price. Price won Tuesday's election with 51
percent of the vote.
   Walters also received 51 percent in defeating U.S. Rep. Wes
Watkins, who decided against seeking another term in Congress to
run for governor.
   Walters, Price and independent Thomas Ledgerwood will be on the
Nov. 6 ballot seeking to replace Gov. Henry Bellmon, who did not
seek re-election.
   Lloyd Noble II, the Tulsa oil man who circulated the initiative
petition that got the term-limitation issue, hailed the vote as
``democracy in action.''
   Stipe contended the action concentrated ``more power in the
media and more power to the lobbyists.'' Stipe and other
legislators had warned that passage would mean that inexperienced
legislators will lean on lobbyists and get direction from newspaper
editorials in making their legislative decisions.
   ``It is always good to have someone around who remembers what
the bureaucrats' problems were four or six years ago and what the
lobbyists said then,'' said Stipe.
   Still, Stipe added, ``I've always believed in what the people
say, we should do. ... I can serve until the year 2004, and right
now I plan to do just that.''

<HEAD>Decision On Conflict Charges Against Bush Is Months Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A final decision in the government's
conflict-of-interest case against Neil Bush won't be made until
next spring, a federal regulator said Wednesday.
   The president's 35-year-old son faces a public hearing starting
next Tuesday in Denver on the government's charges against him.
Bush was a director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association, a Denver thrift that collapsed in late 1988 at a cost
to taxpayers estimated at $1 billion.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision is seeking an order against
Bush which effectively could bar him from working for a bank or a
savings and loan. The thrift agency contends that Bush failed to
adequately disclose to Silverado his business relationships with
developers Kenneth M. Good and Bill L. Walters, two big borrowers
from the institution.
   Bush has denied any wrongdoing.
   Administrative Law Judge Daniel J. Davidson won't make an
immediate decision on the case after the hearing before him. Both
sides will file detailed written arguments which are due on Oct.
23, OTS Chief Counsel Harris Weinstein told reporters at a
briefing.
   Bush and the regulators will have until Nov. 6 to respond in
writing to each other's arguments, Weinstein said. That deadline,
like others in the proceeding, could be extended.
   After considering the two sides' briefs, Davidson is expected to
make a non-binding recommendation by Dec. 6 to OTS Director Timothy
Ryan.
   The judge could recommend to Ryan that the regulators' proposed
cease-and-desist order against Bush be issued, or he could rule
against it. The order would bar Bush from engaging in future
actions that would involve a conflict of interest.
   Davidson also could recommend a stronger permanent prohibition,
Weinstein said. Five other former officers and directors of
Silverado, including former chairman Michael R. Wise, consented to
prohibition orders earlier this year.
   The cease-and-desist order proposed by OTS would stop short of
totally banning Bush from the financial institutions industry, but
could impose strict conditions on his holding such a job in the
future. A prohibition order would be an ``absolute bar,'' Weinstein
said.
   A draft internal document written earlier this year by OTS staff
members recommended that a prohibition order be issued against
Bush. But the thrift agency later found there wasn't sufficient
evidence to support a prohibition and the less serious
cease-and-desist order was proposed, an OTS spokesman has said.
   Under the administrative timetable, the two sides would be
required to respond to Davidson's recommendation by next Jan. 7.
   Ryan would make his decision by April 8, Weinstein said. Bush
would have the right to appeal the decision, most likely to the
U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver, he said.
   At next week's hearing, the regulators will challenge the
testimony of expert witnesses called by Bush to defend his actions.
Bush also will testify.
   The OTS will call other outside experts, former Silverado
officials and some of its own regulators to buttress the
government's case against Bush. Witnesses to be called by the
agency include Wise; Russell Murray, a former loan officer at
Silverado; and Florian Barth, a former Silverado director.
   Wise and Murray have been issued subpoenas to testify, while the
other witnesses are appearing voluntarily. Wise has said he plans
to take the Fifth Amendment and decline to answer some questions
because they could incriminate him.
   In that case, Davidson would decide whether Wise would be
allowed to do so.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Leniency, Sentenced Stout To 46-Month Prison Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former leader of the union representing
city employees was sentenced Wednesday to 46 months in prison for
theft, conspiracy, mail fraud and racketeering.
   Earl Stout may have been ``a good man and a generous man but
unfortunately his generosity was with somebody else's money - the
union whose trust he enjoyed,'' said U.S. District Judge J. William
Ditter Jr.
   Stout, who will be 68 this month, headed District Council 33 of
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
for 14 years. He was convicted in May of stealing more than
$700,000 from the union, which represents 13,000 municipal workers,
most of them trash collectors.
   Defense attorney Elizabeth Ainslie was able to dissuade Ditter
from imposing the maximum 70-month sentence the government sought.
Stout will be on probation for three years after he serves his jail
term.
   ``Mr. Stout is not an evil man,'' Ainslie said. ``He is, in
fact, a good man. It is true that he acted often without
authorization. But he always acted in the best interests of the
union, which was central in his life.''
   Stout's attorney said she would immediately appeal to the 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. She said Stout would remain free on
$100,000 bail pending that appeal, which could take a year.
   Stout was convicted on 32 counts of mail fraud, six of theft and
one each of conspiracy and racketeering.
   Among the allegations were that he gave no-show jobs at
union-owned John F. Kennedy Hospital, which was headed by his son.
He also was accused of hiring consultants without permission from
the union's governing boards, converting the beneficiary on two
life insurance policies on himself from the hospital to his family,
and using hospital employees to work on properties owned by his
family or his friends.
   Ditter also ordered Stout to make restitution to the union of
$445,309, although Assistant U.S. Attorney John Dodds had asked the
judge to order Stout to repay $1,016,281.
   Union attorney Howard Kaufman told the judge restitution was
important and that Stout ``without authority took thousands and
thousands of dollars.''
   Stout said nothing to the judge before sentencing.
   The judge said the sentence was limited to federal guidelines
and acknowledged Stout ``did a great deal for the union members,
but he also did a great deal for himself.''
   Ainslie said Stout had no comment after the sentence. ``He was
obviously relieved it wasn't a longer sentence,'' she said.
   She said Stout never stole money from the union, even if he may
have wasted it, and that she would pursue that argument on appeal.
   Cynthia Bullock, former head of the union's legal services
program, was convicted with Stout on May 4 of illegally getting
money from the union treasury. Ditter sentenced her Wednesday to
six months of house detention followed by five years' probation.
   Ms. Bullock was convicted of conspiracy, mail fraud and
embezzlement.

   Who is Charles Johnson? Everyone wanted to know
on Wednesday, the day after the little known Tacoma lawyer pulled
off the political upset of the year in Washington state.
   No one is quite sure how or why, but Johnson defeated the chief
justice of the state Supreme Court in Tuesday's primary, thus
virtually assuring himself of winning Washington's top judicial job
in November.
   His victory over Chief Justice Keith Callow came out of nowhere.
   All eyes had been on another state Supreme Court race, in which
former Gov. John Spellman was challenging Justice Richard Guy. The
power of incumbency worked for Guy, who staved off Spellman.
   But for no immediately apparent reason, the same quirky voters
bounced Callow, an amiable moderate who had made neither waves nor
enemies on the bench. By a 53-to-47 percent margin, they picked the
39-year-old Johnson, who had done little more than pay his filing
fee and wait for lightning to strike.
   Johnson, as amazed as anyone, said he decided to run ``because
nobody ever runs against these guys and I think the people want
someone else to vote for. They wanted a new face on the bench.''
   ``I'm not a politician,'' he added. ``I'm not a Democrat or
Republican. I'm a true independent. I owe nothing to anyone. I
accepted no campaign contributions, I paid my $800 filing fee out
of my own pocket.''
   There was a sense of disbelief at the high court.
   ``We're in shock here. We don't know what happened,'' said
Supreme Court Clerk Jerry Merritt.
   Justice Bob Utter, senior member of the high court, said he had
no explanation.
   ``It's obvious Keith should have campaigned,'' Utter said.
   Callow conceded the point.
   ``Between the filing period and election with court business,
with the Bar Association meeting and with the Judicial Conference,
I didn't campaign, he didn't campaign and now the voters have
spoken,'' Callow said.
   ``I wish Johnson well,'' he added, ``and I wish the court well
the next six years.''
   Secretary of State Ralph Munro suggested that voters may have
confused Johnson with King County Superior Court Judge Charles V.
Johnson, or possibly Justice Charles Z. Smith, both well known in
King County, the state's largest.
   That theory washed out when it was learned that Callow had
outpolled Johnson in King County.
   ``I don't know what you can attribute it to except the name
confusion,'' Munro said. ``I think this is going to prompt a look
at the law.''
   Munro said it might be better to have Supreme Court races
decided in the general rather than the primary election, even when
there are only two candidates.
   Johnson's name will appear alone on the ballot Nov. 6, virtually
assuring him of election.
   Johnson said he is a graduate of the University of Puget Sound
Law School and has been practicing criminal and civil law in Tacoma
for 13 years.
   He said he probably could be considered conservative but his
answers to questions suggested no strong ideological leaning.
   He said he is strongly pro-choice on abortion. He supports the
death penalty, but does not want to see a speed-up in the appeal
process for death cases.
   Johnson said he wasn't worried that the sitting justices would
resent him or regard him as unqualified.
   ``I don't know any of the justices, but I know their work,'' he
said. ``I read every decision handed down by the Supreme Court and
I read every legal article I can lay my hands on. I have the legal
knowledge needed to sit on the court.''

<HEAD>Episcopal Bishops Disown Homosexual Ordination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Episcopal Church's House of Bishops has
disassociated itself from the ordination nine months ago of a
homosexual priest.
   Church spokesmen said the bishops, after an emotional debate at
their autumn meeting, voted narrowly to affirm that it is
``inappropriate'' to ordain a practicing homosexual.
   ``We regret the hurt and confusion caused for many members of
the church and by subsequent events,'' the bishops said of the
ordination last December of the Rev. Robert Williams by Bishop John
Spong of Newark, N.J.
   ``We believe that good order is not served when bishops,
dioceses or parishes act unilaterally,'' said the resolution,
submitted by Bishop William Wantland of Eau Claire, Wis., and
approved Tuesday.
   Spong later suspended Williams from functioning in the diocese
after he made public remarks disparaging monogamy and the celibacy
of Mother Teresa of India.
   However, Spong sharply critized his fellow bishops' action,
saying:
   ``The way the church treats its gay and lesbian members ...
strains the very fabric of my life by tearing it between my loyalty
to Jesus Christ, who made a habit of embracing the outcast, and my
loyalty to a church that historically has rejected blacks, women
and gays.''
   Bishop William Frey, dean of Trinity School for Ministry in
Pennsylvania, characterized the bishops' action as a mild
reprimand.
   ``Some have said this is a gun pointed at the head of Spong,''
Frey said. ``But it's really a water pistol.''

<HEAD>Congressional Report Says Forced Labor Widespread In China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forced labor is widespread in China, according
to a congressional report that says some prison products may be
reaching the United States illegally.
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative agency of
Congress, says China, with millions of prisoners in 3,000 to 5,000
``re-education'' facilities, uses inmates in farming, mining and
manufacturing.
   The report, prepared for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
and made public this week, says the Customs Service is
investigating allegations that such goods have been imported into
the United States.
   The report says products made by Chinese prisoners include tin,
handmade rugs, fireworks, baskets, bags and clothing.
   ``Both government and private sources have circumstantial
evidence that the products of forced labor have been exported (by
China) and that such products might have reached the United
States,'' the report said.
   The importation of products made by foreign prisoners is illegal
under a 100-year-old law.
   The congressional report is based on information from private
and government sources.
   Tracing inmate-made goods is difficult because most products
from China pass through several business transactions before they
reach U.S. consumers, the report said.
   It quoted a Chinese press report as saying that prisoners
produce 5,000 products, yielding $1.5 billion in sales annually.
   Some prisoner labor also has been used to attract foreign
investors for joint ventures, the report said, citing the case of a
Chinese wine jointly produced with a French company using grapes
grown on prison farms. The practice was stoped when the French
discovered the source of the grapes,the report said.

<HEAD>Souter Hearings End; Confident GOP Presses for Quick Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee completed
hearings on Supreme Court nominee David Souter on Wednesday with
all signs pointing to quick approval.
   Committee chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., tentatively set a
committee vote for next Thursday, while confident Republicans were
already looking ahead to the timing of a vote by the full Senate.
   Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole and Sen. Orrin Hatch, a senior member
of the judiciary panel, said there should be a quick final vote so
Souter could take his place as the nation's 105th Supreme Court
justice in time for the start of the fall term on Oct. 1.
   While some lawmakers have voiced reservations, none has spoken
out against Souter. And several members of the Judiciary Committee
told him as his three days of testimony neared an end on Monday
that his confirmation was all but certain.
   Informal speeches supporting him were already beginning on the
Senate floor on Wednesday.
   A Democrat, Sen. J. James Exon of Nebraska, said Souter would be
fair to those who came before him and ``that is all we can ask and
all we can expect from a member of the Supreme Court.''
   A number of Republicans added their praise, including John
Chafee, R-R.I., who said that Souter had been careful to avoid
commitments on key issues but ``if we want to take a leap of faith,
Judge Souter, in my judgment is the best one to take that leap
with.''
   Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican whose opposition
helped defeat the nomination of Robert Bork, said of Souter, ``I
intend to support him in committee and on the floor.''
   The committee on Wednesday heard conflicting views on whether
Souter, who has spent most of his 51 years living in a small New
Hampshire town, was sensitive to the concerns of minorities.
   Wesley Williams Jr., a Washington attorney who traced his
friendship with Souter back to Harvard College and Harvard Law
School, told the committee that Souter was ``fundamentally fair,
lacking in prejudice.''
   Williams, who is black, said he was confident Souter would be
``prepared to do the right thing'' in fighting discrimination once
on the high court.
   But Haywood Burns, past president of the National Lawyers Guild
and another Harvard acquaintance, said he wasn't so sure.
   ``I did not find he had an understanding of human rights,'' said
Burns, who also is black. ``The person that I knew is very
different than the one Mr. Williams described.''
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said he had ``a considerable amount of
unease'' about Souter's appreciation of civil rights issues based
on his record as a judge. Souter's comments during three days of
testimony at the confirmation hearings appeared ``more
enlightened,'' Simon said, but he wondered whether that represented
personal growth or political acumen.
   A leading conservative on Wednesday also opposed Souter,
questioning his moral underpinnings on a different issue -
abortion.
   Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, said based
on Souter's record he was ``absolutely certain ... that Judge
Souter has a permissive view toward abortion.''
   An anti-abortion member of the committee, Sen. Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H., said he, too, was troubled but, reflecting the view of many
conservatives, said he would give the nominee the benefit of the
doubt.
   Perhaps Souter ``had never really given it deep thought,'' said
Humphrey.
   Despite doubts put forth on both ends of the political spectrum,
no stated opposition to Souter has emerged in the Senate.
   Some witnesses at the hearings implored Biden to bring Souter
back to the stand for more questions, but he refused. He said the
schedule for the confirmation vote was being worked out with the
Republicans, who were pushing for quick action.
   ``After three days and 18 hours of often grueling congressional
testimony, Judge Souter has demonstrated to America that he
deserves a place on our nation's highest court,'' said Dole, R-Kan.
   ``I urge the Judiciary Committee to act as quickly as possible
so that Judge Souter can be confirmed by the full Senate before the
Supreme Court begins its October term,'' he said.
   Hatch, R-Utah, a senior member of the committee, said Souter
would be handicapped if he didn't join the court on time.
   ``I want him on the court by Oct. 1,'' Hatch said. By law, the
court session begins that day, the first Monday in October.
   In other testimony Wednesday, homosexual rights advocates
opposed Souter. Law enforcement groups endorsed him.
   Urvashi Vaid, director of the National Gay &amp; Lesbian Task Force,
said Souter would ``continue the shameful denial of equal justice
under which gay and lesbian Americans live ... tilting the court to
the right in critical areas of civil rights and privacy.''
   Much of the gay-rights opposition was based on a New Hampshire
Supreme Court decision in which Souter joined in saying that
homosexuals could be barred from adopting children.
   Dewey Stokes, national president of the Fraternal Order of
Police, said law enforcement officers appreciated Souter's
practical approach in criminal cases.
   ``Judge Souter has demonstrated an appreciation for the
application of black-letter law to fact patterns and situations
faced daily by police ... that do not always lend themselves to
tidy, legalistic conclusions,'' he said.

   An electrical surgical instrument caused the

officials said.
   The cauterizing tool, used to sear small blood vessels and
lessen bleeding during surgery, apparently brushed against a metal
instrument tray, causing sparks that ignited material draped over
the patient at University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center,
investigators said Tuesday.
   ``This was a terribly unfortunate accident,'' Deputy Fire Chief
Davis Parsons said at a news conference about the findings of an
investigation into the May 28 fire that killed Angela Hernandez.
   Ms. Hernandez, 26, was being treated for heart and liver damage
suffered in a traffic accident.
   The cauterizing tool was not in use when the fire began but was
dangling from an instrument tray, said Battalion Chief William
Burmester.
   In October 1988, a cauterizing tool started a fire that killed a
15-day-old infant undergoing heart surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center.
   The pen-sized tool has been common in operating rooms since the
1920s. In the oxygen-rich environment of an operating room, any
spark can easily ignite flammable materials, investigators said.
   Fire officials called for legislation requiring flame-resistant
surgical drapery.

<HEAD>Researchers Report on Clues to Heart Attack Cause</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The virus that causes fever blisters and cold
sores also may cause the artery-blocking clots that lead to heart
attacks, according to a study.
   The suspect organism is herpes simplex virus-1, or HSV-1, which
can remain dormant in the body for years, according to a report by
University of Minnesota researchers in Tuesday's issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.
   The report says the clots may be caused by a ``flashing on'' or
sudden activation of HSV-1. The virus can set off a series of
changes in the lining of a coronary artery that touch off clot
formation and inhibit the dissolution of the clots, the researchers
said.
   Heart attacks occur when the blood supply to the heart is
blocked.
   ``If our hypothesis is correct, it could lead to treatment that
would prevent the herpes virus from being flashed on,'' said Dr.
Harry Jacob, head of hematology at the University of Minnesota and
leader of the study.
   Jacob emphasized that the research ``has all been at the
laboratory bench. We haven't looked at this in people.''
   In spite of that, Dr. Morrison Hodges, chief of cardiology at
Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, said the finding
``sounds very exciting.''
   ``The idea of being able to get at the molecular basis for
plaque and the subsequent clot formation is exciting,'' he said.
``Getting at the basic mechanism (of vexing medical problems) is a
real clinical problem.''
   Gregory Vercellotti, one of the researchers, said the herpes
virus infects cells in the lining of the artery and halts
production of molecules that usually prevent blood from sticking to
it. The virus also can cause platelets in the blood to stick
together, he said.
   Jacob said it is possible that HSV-2, which causes genital
herpes, also may be involved in coronary disease. That theory is
untested.
   He said the drug acyclovir can suppress herpes symptoms, but
there is no evidence that the drug would prevent heart attacks.
   At least 70 percent of Americans have been exposed to HSV-1, and
millions of people develop fever blisters when exposed to intense
sunlight, friction or some form of stress. That's an indication
that the virus lies inactive in the body until something activates
it.
   The hypothesis that the herpes virus lies dormant in the inner
wall of a coronary artery isn't widely accepted, said Dr. Jesse
Goodman, one of Jacob's associates in the research.
   ``But this is all very tantalizing,'' Goodman said.
   Other researchers have found traces of HSV-1 in atherosclerotic
plaque, the material that narrows coronary arteries. Some
researchers believe the virus causes damage that causes plaque to
collect on the lining of the artery.
   The first strong evidence of a link between herpes and heart
attacks was reported in 1983 by Dr. E.P. Benditt of the University
of Washington. He found genetic markers for HSV-1 in plaque that
had been removed from patients whose clogged coronary arteries were
surgically bypassed.
   Earlier this year, researchers at Cornell Medical College
reported discovering that the virus invades human cells by riding
piggyback on a protein that cells need to survive. The Cornell
scientists said they were on the trail of a link between the virus
and hardening of the arteries.

   Public spending on drug abuse treatment should
be increased by more than $2 billion to help more users quit their
drug habits, a panel of experts recommended Wednesday.
   ``Treatment needs to be recognized as a more important component
of drug policy than it has been in recent years,'' said Lawrence S.
Lewin, chairman of the Institute of Medicine committee that studied
the problem.
   ``It is time we allocated sufficient resources so that everyone
who needs drug treatment will be able to get it,'' said Lewin, a
health-policy consultant.
   He said he was encouraged that the Bush administration has
increased support for treatment to around $600 million, but the
panel recommended boosting that by $2.2 billion annually to expand
services. It also recommended spending $1.1 billion in one-time
costs to upgrade facilities.
   An estimated 5.5 million people in the United States need
treatment for drug abuse or dependence, according to the panel's
report, which was requested by Congress.
   But in 1987, the latest year for which figures were available,
about 650,000 received treatment in public programs and 200,000
were treated in private programs, the report said.
   ``The present war on drugs could be fought more effectively'' if
more people could get treatment on demand, if the quality of
treatment programs were improved and spending were better managed,
Lewin said.
   ``While drug treatment programs vary widely in their methods and
results, the treatment methods available today can yield benefits -
including reduced criminal activity - that well exceed the costs of
delivering these services,'' he said.
   The quality of public programs deteriorated through most of the
1980s, largely because of aid cutbacks, the report said. Federal
support grew quickly in the early 1970s to $300 million, then
stabilized around $260 million through the end of the decade but
sank to $160 million in 1982. Federal aid remained around that
level until it jumped to $370 million in 1987 and $520 million in
1989.
   Treatment with methadone, a synthetic narcotic, can effectively
wean addicts from heroin when given in adequate doses, the report
said.
   However, tight regulations on its use as well as criticism that
it substitutes one dependence for another have combined to
encourage many programs to give lower-than-effective doses, it
said. Also financial strains make it difficult for programs to
retain competent staff, it said.
   Therapeutic communities, typically a highly structured
residential program lasting six to 18 months with intensive therapy
and work responsibilities, were found to be effective. These
programs usually serve those with hard-core drug problems,
including people with criminal records.
   Outpatient nonmethadone programs of counseling and therapy were
the least expensive, but varied widely in methods and philosophies.
   The panel said that while hospital-based dependency programs are
more expensive, they are no more effective than residential
programs for most patients.
   In many communities, drug abusers must wait months to enter a
public treatment program, while capacity goes unused in private
facilities.
   ``There's a lot of capacity if you have insurance,'' Lewin said.

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as
of Sept. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 6.99 million
head, up 5 percent from a year ago and 1 percent more than two
years ago, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Feedlot inventories were up from a year earlier in Colorado,
Iowa, Kansas and Texas. But they declined in Arizona, California
and Nebraska.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in August totaled 1.67 million
head, down 2 percent from a year ago and 7 percent fewer than two
years ago.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.74 million head, up 6 percent from a year
ago and 5 percent more than in September 1988, the report said.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states, which account for about three-fourths of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Sept.
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

<HEAD>Report: Ousted Stasi Chief Threatened Honecker in Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's ousted secret police
chief threatened to break former Communist leader Erich Honecker's
neck when the two faced each other in jail, a West German newspaper
reported Wednesday.
   ``You traitor!'' 82-year-old former security chief Erich Mielke
shouted at Honecker, according to Bild newspaper.
   Mielke also screamed at Honecker ``I'll break your neck!'' the
newspaper quoted witnesses as describing the scene when the two met
in an East German jail. Honecker, 78, was jailed for one day in
January.
   Mielke for years headed the dreaded secret police, known as
Stasi, which built up files on 6 million East Germans and kept a
tight rein on the population. He was one of Honecker's closest
aides.
   After the popular revolt last fall that ousted the Communist
regime and opened the way to German unification, Mielke and other
former Communist leaders were jailed.
   Mielke remains in custody. Honecker was released from jail for
health reasons.
   West German authorities on Tuesday opened a criminal
investigation of Mielke. He is suspected of giving sanctuary to
members of West Germany's leftist terrorist group, the Red Army
Faction, and of setting up contacts between the group and
Palestinian guerrillas.
   Honecker is also the target of several criminal investigations,
one in West Germany for obstruction of justice.
   Bild said the imprisoned Mielke also accused other former
Communist officials of betrayal and threatened to retaliate against
them.
   One prison warden told Bild that many of the guards had worked
for Mielke's Stasi and that they might interpret his threat against
Honecker as an order to kill the former Communist chief.
   Bild said Mielke and other members of Honecker's ruling circle
will be moved to a West Berlin prison after German unification on
Oct. 3.
   Honecker also will be moved to the same jail if his health
improves enough for him to be imprisoned. He is suffering from
kidney cancer and is being kept at a Soviet military hospital
oustide East Berlin.

<TEXT>
   Nine months after a Yugoslav freighter
ran aground and destroyed a 500-foot swath of live coral off Key
West, the state and the ship's owner and captain have reached a
tentative $3.3 million settlement.
   Tuesday's agreement, which must still be approved by Gov. Bob
Martinez and the Cabinet, came just one day before a lawsuit filed
over the grounding would have gone to trial in Key West.
   ``We think it's a very, very good settlement,'' John Costigan,
chief of environmental litigation in Attorney General Bob
Butterworth's office.
   Allen Von Spiegelfeld, a Tampa attorney who represented the
freighter Mavro Vetranic, owner Atlantska Plovidba and captain
Zdravko Berana, said his clients agreed to the proposed settlement
late Monday by telephone from Yugoslavia.
   The ?3.3 million will go to the state's coral reef restoration
fund, which finances research and other activity to preserve and
revitalize the reefs.
   The Florida barrier reef, a tract of about 6,000 coral reefs
extending from Miami along the Keys to the Dry Tortugas archipelago
west of Key West, is the third-longest barrier reef in the world.
It's home to 52 coral species and 10 times as many fish. It can
take 100 years for a coral to grow one yard.
   The grounding last Oct. 30 was the second of three such
incidents in less than three weeks in the Florida Keys.
   The federal government filed a $9 million lawsuit alleging that
the Mavro Vetranic was unseaworthy and its crew incompetent when it
ran aground. But government attorneys later conceded that the reef
was in state territory and stepped aside to let the state handle
the suit, Costigan said.

<HEAD>Governments Warned to Let Fuel Prices Rise in Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and other governments risk
shortages and other troubles if they try to hold down the price of
gasoline at the pump as the Gulf crisis drives up the price of oil,
the International Monetary Fund warned on Wednesday.
   Price controls lead to shortages while price subsidies cost
governments money, the fund said in its semi-annual ``World
Economic Outlook.'' It added that cheap money policies to help
businesses hit by high oil prices could result in inflation and, in
the longer run, higher interest rates and a drop in output and
jobs.
   ``Oil price controls and artificial interventions of this type
create pressures that will burst one day,'' Jacob Frenkel, the
fund's research chief, told a news conference.
   So far there has been no sign of a major country trying to block
price increases to consumers, said Ernesto Hernandez-Cata, who was
in charge of the report. He added that recent U.S. figures show the
oil price increase already reflected in higher consumer prices.
   Both men are Americans.
   The fund watches 151 member countries and some that would like
to join, particularly the Soviets. For the first time, the Soviet
Union will be sending a delegation as guests to the annual meetings
of the fund and its sister organization, the World Bank, which open
here Monday.
   President Bush is expected to address one session. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady will be the top U.S. delegate.
   The report predicted small but significant effects of the oil
price rise over the next year. Looking ahead for three years, it
saw greater importance for the world in the unification of Germany
and the movement away from communism in eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union.
   The fund's calculations are based on a price of $26 a barrel of
oil for the rest of this year, and a decline to $21 by the end of
1991. This week prices are running $32 to $33.
   Hernandez-Cata said the fund's scenario is consistent with a
settlement of the crisis by next spring, and with the promises of
other oil producers to make up for a loss of production from Iraq
and Kuwait.
   ``Of course, the price depends on the political and military
situation and we're not experts in either of those fields,'' he
said.
   The report sees the growth of world production dropping to 2
percent this year and 2.4 percent in 1991, from 3 percent in 1989.
Last May, before the invasion of Kuwait, the fund forecast 2.3
percent for 1990 and 3.1 percent for 1991.
   Relatively low growth is foreseen for the United States: 1.3
percent in 1990 and 1.7 percent in 1991.
   The highest growth is foreseen for Japan: 5.1 percent this year
and 3.7 percent next year, and West Germany -- 3.9 and 3.3 percent.
The fund's calculations put production of a unified Germany in 1991
at 2 percent greater than it would be if it remained divided.
   Lumping together the Soviet Union and other east European
countries, the report sees a decline in production of 2.5 percent
this year and .3 of 1 percent in 1991. It said this would be due to
the short-run shock of change. But it foresaw a better situation
over the following few years as market-based economic measures are
introduced.
   Third World countries are expected to grow at a slower pace
--2.25 percent this year compared with 3 percent in 1989. This
amount of growth means that individual incomes in many will
continue to decline -- especially in Africa -- since their
population will increase faster than their production.

<TEXT>
   A House-Senate conference committee, working
on the 1990 farm bill, decided Wednesday to take some of the
uncertainty out of winter wheat planting by voting for 15 percent
acreage reduction.
   The vote occurred at the first meeting of the committee that
will be melding the two versions of the five-year bill approved
this summer by the House and Senate.
   It came at the urging of the Agriculture Department which needs
to advise farmers on planting requirements for participation in the
government's subsidy programs.
   Though action on the farm bill is far from complete, winter
wheat planting for the 1991 crop year has begun.
   Under the provision approved by the conference committee,
farmers will have to idle 15 percent of their acreage for this year
only to participate in the price support program. Reduction during
subsequent years covered by the farm bill is to be decided later.
   The purpose of acreage reduction is to keep surplus wheat stocks
from getting too large.
   The conferees agreed to begin taking the massive farm bill title
by title on Monday.
   Both House and Senate agriculture committee chairmen, Rep. Kika
de la Garza, D-Texas, and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said
differences in the bill were small compared to most legislation
going to conference committee.
   ``The differences between the House and the Senate could be
resolved in a couple of days,'' said de la Garza. ``The difficult
part is the budget.''
   Negotiations between the White House and Congress over budget
cuts are not complete. De la Garza said he did not know how much
would be taken from agriculture.
   ``If there is an agreement at the budget summit,'' said Leahy,
``both Chairman de la Garza and I are committed to producing a farm
bill that is consistent with budget responsibilities.''

<TEXT>
   The owners of WSNS-TV in Chicago lost a
lengthy license renewal battle Wednesday when the Federal
Communications Commission, in a rare move, said a competing
applicant was more deserving to run the station.
   The commission granted Monroe Communications Corp. a license to
build a new TV station on channel 44. It said Monroe was more
qualified than the current licensee, Video 44, which had switched
the station's format to a subscription movie service.
   Monroe, which began seeking the license in 1982, also claimed
Video 44 had broadcast obscene material, but the FCC did not reach
a decision on that allegation.
   The FCC almost never denies license renewals to incumbents and
already had given Video 44 a renewal in 1989. But the commission
reconsidered the case under orders from a federal appeals court in
Washington.
   Video 44 may appeal the decision to the appeals court.
Otherwise, it must discontinue operations 90 days after the FCC
formally releases its renewal order, which could occur sometime in
the next week or so, FCC spokeswoman Maureen Peratino said.
   Video 44 officials in Chicago did not immediately return a call
seeking comment Wednesday.
   Monroe's attorney, Howard Gilbert, said ``Today's decision means
the FCC is sending the clearest possible signal that it expects
every TV station to meet the highest standards of public interest
in order to earn the expectation of a license renewal.''
   Monroe's principals include such prominent Chicago business
executives as Robert Haag, the co-founder of Alberto-Culver Co.,
and Wayne Fickinger, the former president of the J. Walter Thompson
advertising agency.
   Video 44 is 50 percent owned by Harriscope Corp., which also
operates KWHY-TV in Los Angeles.
   After the license challenge began, WSNS switched to
Spanish-language programming. Gilbert said Monroe intends to
continue similar programming.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Wednesday upheld a Bush
administration policy prohibiting federal funding of foreign family
planning agencies that perform abortions.
   The challenge was brought by the Planned Parenthood Federation
of America, which asserted the policy was an unconstitutional
violation of its First Amendment right to advocate abortion. The
organization also said the policy interferes with the privacy
rights of people seeking abortion information.
   Howver, the ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
said the anti-abortion policy of the U.S. Agency for International
Development was legal and didn't restrict how Planned Parenthood
spends money it receives outside federal grants.
   ``Planned Parenthood may continue to participate as a conduit
for AID funds that are restricted to non-abortion activities while
maintaining with its own funds abortion-related activities in the
same countries,'' the judges said.
   The appeals court upheld a March ruling by U.S. District Judge
John Walker who found that the president has the authority to
impose such a policy affecting private organizations overseas.
   ``This decision means that tax dollars will no longer support
organizations which campaign to legalize abortion as a method of
birth control overseas,'' the National Right to Life Committee
said, hailing the court of appeals ruling.
   Planned Parenthood didn't respond to telephone calls for
comment.
   AID began the policy under President Reagan in 1984. The Bush
administration elected to retain the policy which states that
foreign private health agencies, in return for U.S. grants, certify
that they don't perform or actively promote abortion as a method of
family planning.

   The United States will increasingly ask allies
for money to meet foreign policy needs rather than further strain
its own federal budget, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger told Congress Wednesday.
   Separately, lawmakers gave a chilly reception to the
administration's plan for such money to go into a ``National
Defense Gift Fund,'' which the Pentagon could tap without prior
congressional approval.
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
called the administration request an attempt to set up ``in effect,
a military spending slush fund.''
   In other developments:
   - President Bush warned anew that Saddam Hussein could expect
further action against Iraq if the U.N. economic embargo and
diplomatic efforts fail to move his forces out of Kuwait.
   Bush, on a campaign trip to California, said that if Iraq
doesn't withdraw, ``then its isolation will not end. We are, as I
have said before, prepared to take additional steps if sanctions
and the quest for a political resolution do not work.''
   - The Army ordered 62 reserve units in 27 states to report for
active duty in support of the military buildup in the Persian Gulf
area, and alerted 24 other units to prepare for possible call-up.
The Navy said it was activating 3 reserve units.
   - Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he had approved ``imminent
danger pay'' for the more than 150,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors and
airmen already in the gulf region, retroactive to Sept. 1.
   U.S. fund-raising efforts have so far yielded pledges of $20
billion from Persian Gulf states, Japan, Germany and the European
Community to meet the costs of deterring aggression by Iraq.
   ``This ... is a kind of a new invention in the practice of
diplomacy,'' Eagleburger said of such soliciting in testimony to
the House Appropriations foreign aid subcommittee.
   ``I would expect you will see this administration approaching
foreign policy questions more and more in that direction,'' he
added.
   Eagleburger acknowledged that such an arrangement ``creates some
constitutional problems'' because it could establish a pool of
money outside Congress' jurisdiction.
   At the same time, the Appropriations defense subcommittee,
meeting behind closed to act on Bush's request for an additional
$1.9 billion to meet unexpected gulf costs, sought to ensure that
any money raised from allies would be subject to congressional
control.
   The White House had asked Congress to approve the gift fund,
which would receive donations from friendly countries and which
would be available to the Pentagon to spend as it saw fit.
   Cheney argued at the hearing that such authority would increase
his flexibility in the Middle East troop deployment. He promised to
work out a way to keep Congress informed of how the money was being
spent.
   But subcommittee chairman John Murtha, D-Pa., labeled the
request ``unacceptable,'' and foreign aid subcommittee chief David
Obey, D-Wis., called it ``one of the most spectacular end-runs
around the Constitution ... I have ever witnessed.''
   America's leadership role in the Persian Gulf has put mammoth
new strains on an already overstretched federal budget. Costs
include not only the expense of deploying 150,000 troops, but also
the need for new aid to allies such as Egypt whose economies are
suffering because of the crisis.
   Of the $20 billion raised so far, roughly half is destined to
help shore up the economies of such front-line states, Eagleburger
said.
   But he also argued strongly at the hearing for cancellation of
some $6.7 billion in debts Egypt owes the United States from past
military equipment purchases, saying Cairo's already weak economy
is suffering a $3.7 billion added shock from the gulf crisis.
   ``Failure to meet these needs could threaten political stability
in Egypt, with potentially serious consequences for everything we
and our Egyptian friends are now doing to resist Saddam's
aggression,'' he said.
   And he said Bush feels strongly that the gesture was important
as a public show of support for Egypt and for President Hosni
Mubarak, who Eagleburger said ``is and must continue to be the
solid foundation of Arab leadership'' in the region.
   While Congress, which must approve any request for debt relief,
has voiced appreciation for Mubarak's leadership, it has also been
skeptical about the size of the reward. Lawmakers are leery of any
increase in foreign aid at a time when budget cutters are being
forced to hack away at favorite domestic programs.
   Eagleburger acknowledged that debt relief for Egypt would
trigger requests from other countries who believe themselves
deserving, but he added: ``We are not going to be anxious to be
generous with most of the requests.''
   He said Israel, whose foreign aid package has traditionally been
linked to the size of Egypt's, would also be getting more from the
United States. ``It's no secret we're talking about what kind of an
assistance effort we should put together'' for Israel, he said.
   While specific aid figures and weapons transfers for Israel
remain to be worked out, Eagleburger said, an announcement could
come as early as next week on conditions for proceeding with $400
million in loan guarantees to help Israel house an influx of Soviet
Jewish refugees.
   Israeli officials have been in Washington this week arguing for
additional aid, contending the gulf crisis has cost them $1 billion
in additional military spending, the price of maintaining forces on
high alert.
   Eagleburger also said no final decision had been reached on a
proposed mammoth arms sale package for Saudi Arabia, reportedly
planned at a level of $18 billion or more. The final shape of that
package will depend on the outcome of consultations with Congress,
he said.

<HEAD>In a Campaign Replete with `Shockers' and Shocks, Two Outsiders
Win</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: FIXES garble in top two grafs.</NOTE>
<HEAD>With AM-Mass Primary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a gubernatorial primary campaign peppered with
pugnacious one-liners that came to be known as ``shockers,'' John
Silber startled everyone from the elderly to inner-city youth. Then
came the biggest shocker of all: he won.
   Silber, a scrappy philosopher-turned-politician, gave no
indication he would relinquish his hard-hitting campaign style
after Tuesday's Democratic primary.
   ``I think I intend to continue speaking straight, speaking as
directly and as honestly as possible to the people,'' he said.
   With 99 percent of the vote counted, Silber had 54 percent to
former Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti's 44 percent. Lt. Gov.
Evelyn Murphy, who dropped out of the race shortly before the
primary, had 3 percent.
   The shoot-from-the-hip Texan, on leave as president of Boston
University, now faces Republican William Weld, a quintessential
Boston Brahmin with a record as a tough federal prosecutor.
   Silber's controversial track record goes back 19 years, to his
firing as dean of arts and sciences at the University of Texas at
Austin. That followed years of discord with the Board of Regents
over changes made in his department and his criticism of university
policies.
   At BU, he helped transform an academically uneven, debt-plagued
institution into a school of 26,000 with a budget nearing $500
million.
   Silber, 64, who holds a Ph.D. from Yale, and Weld, 45, a summa
cum laude Harvard graduate, don't appear all that far apart: Weld
is perceived as a somewhat liberal Republican and Silber as a
conservative Democrat.
   But their styles are worlds apart.
   Silber said at the outset of his campaign that he wouldn't talk
what he called political ``plastic,'' and his blunt remarks
surprised observers early on.
   Commenting on how best to distribute health care funds, he
referred to extraordinary and costly health care measures to
prolong the life of the elderly and then let loose with:
   ``When you've had a long life, and you're ripe, then it's time
to go.''
   In January, while postulating that Massachusetts' welfare
policies were attracting people from out of state, Silber referred
to Lowell, home to many Cambodian immigrants.
   ``Why should Lowell be the Cambodian capital of America?'' he
asked. ``It is extraordinary. Why should they all be concentrated
in one place?
   Days before the primary, during a televised debate with
Bellotti, Silber said he saw no point going to an inner city area
to talk to ``a group of drug addicts.'' Later, he said he didn't
mean to imply all residents of the predominantly minority area were
on drugs.
   If he wins the general election, it will be a bit of a financial
comedown for Silber, who gets $275,000 plus a house in his current
post, compared to the governor's $75,000 paycheck and no mansion.
   Weld was another winner in the rush to evict the political
leadership voters associated with two years of fiscal chaos. He
handily defeated House Minority Leader Stephen Pierce, who had been
considered leading just a few weeks ago.
   With 99 percent of the vote counted, Weld had 60 percent and
Pierce 40 percent.
   Weld was appointed U.S. attorney for Massachusetts in 1981. Five
years later, President Reagan named him assistant attorney general
in charge of the criminal division. He resigned from that post in
1988 to protest the actions of then U.S. Attorney Edwin Meese.
   Weld, who lost to Bellotti in the 1978 race for attorney
general, is fiscally conservative, favoring a Citizens for Limited
Taxation proposal that would roll back taxes and fees to their
mid-1988 levels. He is supports women's right to have abortions,
and has stressed his commitment to the environment.
   Silber opposes the Citizens for Limited Taxation tax repeal
initiative, and has said he would campaign hard against the measure
in the general election campaign. He says he personally considers
abortion homicide, but stresses he wouldn't limit abortion rights.

<HEAD>Asbestos Forces Parliament Closes Two Weeks Before Nation Vanishes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The gold-windowed Parliament building, a
shimmering showcase of East Germany's Communist rulers and the
birthplace of its first democracy, closed its doors Wednesday.
   Officials evacuated and locked the Palace of the Republic just
two weeks before the nation itself ceases to exist. It wasn't
German unification that forced the closing, but a legacy of the old
regime: cancer-causing asbestos.
   The move will force the nation's first freely elected
legislature to look for a new place to hold its final three
meetings before it, too, goes out of business when the German
states unite on Oct. 3.
   Parliament, which still has to approve a treaty for unification,
had planned to meet in the building Thursday. As of late Wednesday,
officials still were looking for alternative quarters.
   Government spokesman Matthias Gehler said the future of the
building, a massive, rectangular edifice of white stone and
gold-tinted windows, will be left to the West German government.
   The Palace of the Republic has been mentioned frequently as the
possible new house of a united parliament if the Parliament moves
to Berlin, capital of the new Germany.
   Gehler said one expert estimated that it will cost $253 million
to rid the building of the asbestos.
   The fire retardent was sprayed throughout the inside, some of it
more than an inch thick, and Gehler said the fibrous asbestos
deposits could be jarred into the air by mere room drafts.
   The building was a legacy of the old regime of deposed Communist
boss Erich Honecker, who dedicated the cornerstone on Nov. 2, 1973.
   The massive complex was completed 1,000 days later, standing in
the heart of historic Berlin, its block-like dimensions and huge
Communist insignia - a hammer and drafting compass - an eyesore to
many.
   It became the home of the Communist Parliament that
rubber-stamped the edicts of Honecker's inner circle.
   The building was also the meeting place of national Communist
Party conferences. It contains a theater, bowling alleys, sauna, a
disco and 13 restaurants, cafes and bars.
   Sixteen years after the building was constructed, Honecker was
ousted by masses of people demanding democracy.
   In April, the nation's first democratically elected Parliament
convened for the first time in the building's cavernous meeting
hall.
   The building is on land where the historic Berlin Palace once
stood. The castle was blown up by the Soviets in 1945.
   The fact that the parliamentary building was closed because of
environmental hazards is the latest of a series of ecological
horrors in East Germany, one of the most polluted lands on Earth.
   East Germany's Communists were guilty of allowing unrestrained
waste dumping, unfiltered factory processing and building
inefficient, smoke-belching autos.
   About 1,700 people work in the Parliament building and they will
be given special employment benefits, Gehler said.

<TEXT>
   Keston College, which for 20 years
monitored religious oppression in Communist Eastern Europe, is
struggling to survive under the region's new democracy.
   Some of the college's main supporters have cut their financial
contributions, believing the college no longer serves a purpose.
   ``The reality is that Christians in Eastern Europe think our
work is just beginning,'' said the Rev. Michael Bourdeaux, Keston's
founder-director.
   Bourdeaux has called a meeting Thursday of the college's
20-member management council of Christians and Jews to discuss
Keston's role in a changing world.
   On the eve of the crucial meeting, researchers Jane Ellis and
Phillip Walters were in Moscow. In Keston, Michael Rowe briefed an
American academic headed for Romania and Fiona Tupper-Carey
interviewed the daughter of a Romanian priest.
   Others were busy with research and preparing news releases.
   ``I am certain the college will continue because its academic
work has given it a serious reputation around the world,'' said
Bourdeaux, a canon of Anglican Rochester Cathedral.
   He said that despite the college's mailing list of 14,500
supporters and help it receives from church parishes and trusts,
the administration was having difficulty raising the $756,000 a
year needed to keep Keston functioning.
   That amount pays for the staff, an international
information-gathering and publishing organization and for visitors
to come from Eastern Europe.
   The college has cut its staff from 20 to 14, but the work has
not diminished, Bourdeaux said.
   ``Theological education in the East has fallen to almost nothing
and seminaries need to be restarted,'' Bourdeaux said. ``The
churches need guidance and practical support as these countries
will remain a difficult area, whatever their political systems.''
   One option is to sell the college premises and affiliate with a
university.
   Bourdeaux, 56, said several universities have expressed interest
in taking over the college, which has thousands of books,
newspapers, journals, documents and contacts across Europe and
Asia.
   Nick Woodcock, the college chief executive and secretary, showed
a visitor the secure room where 26 filing cabinets hold documents
about religious activity and persecution in Eastern Europe.
   One envelope contained strips of linen covered with neat,
ball-pen notes of the trial of a Soviet religious dissident, Aida
Skripnikova. Thde notes were brought to the West wrapped around a
traveler's body.
   Skripnikova was released in the 1970s, and is now active in the
church in Leningrad, Rowe said.
   College researchers once used newspapers, telephones, the mail
and interviews with travelers to peer behind the Iron curtain,
Bourdeaux said. Now they travel freely throughout Eastern Europe.
   Ms. Ellis, author of a contemporary history of the Russian
Orthodox Church that has been translated into Russian, was refused
a visa for the Soviet Union for more than five years. But this week
she watched the Russian Republic's Supreme Soviet, reporting on
moves to legalize religious denominations.
   In 1965, Bourdeaux began collecting information on religion in
Eastern Europe. When the work overflowed from his home, in 1973 he
raised $84,000 to buy an old school building in Keston, 14 miles
southeast of London.
   Bourdeaux in 1984 was awarded the Templeton Prize for Progress
in Religion in 1984. Upon making the award, judges said Bourdeaux
had ``stabbed awake the conscience of comfortable Western
Christians.''

<HEAD>New Policy Could End Asylum For Some Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of refugees could lose asylum status
under a new policy to determine if their claims of persecution are
invalidated by political changes in Eastern Europe and Central
America, officials said Wednesday.
   Under the new policy, the rise of new governments in Nicaragua,
Panama, Hungary and Poland could make it more difficult - if not
impossible - for refugees to press claims they would be persecuted
if returned to their homelands.
   Political asylum granted refugees from those countries will be
reviewed under a July 25 directive issued by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. The reviews will be conducted when a
refugee applies for permanent residency after living in this
country for a year, the INS said.
   The largest group affected by the new policy is refugees from
Nicaragua, where the leftist Sandinista government was turned out
of office in Feb. 25 elections.
   Poles and Hungarians who were given political asylum could lose
their refugee status unless they can prove a well-founded fear of
persecution despite the demise of communist governments in their
homelands.
   The same is true of Panamanians who fled the government of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, who was deposed last December when U.S.
forces invaded that country and arrested the dictator on federal
drug trafficking charges.
   It is difficult to get accurate figures on the number of
Nicaraguan refugees living in this country, some estimate there are
hundreds of thousands.
   About 8,000 Nicaraguan refugees have applied for permanent
resident status and have not yet been interviewed, said INS
spokesman Duke Austin.
   As of July, the INS had asylum cases in some stage for 27,000
Nicaraguans, according to Arthur Helton, a refugee expert with the
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
   There were 2,356 asylum cases involving Polish refugees, 313
involving Hungarians and 457 Panamanians that month, he said.
   Miami immigration attorney Robert Boyer said he plans to seek a
federal court injunction to prevent implementation of the policy,
which was contained in a July 25 directive by Deputy Commissioner
Ricardo Inzunza.
   ``No one has been deported as a result of this process,'' Austin
said. The review of asylum status in light of political changes in
the four countries is required by law, he said.
   Refugees whose political asylum is revoked will still be able to
challenge deportation orders in immigration courts, he said.
   Refugees who were interviewed for permanent resident status
before new governments took power in their homelands are not
effected by the new policy, INS officials said.

   A company shipping ballistic missile parts to South
Africa has been shut down by U.S. Customs agents after a six-month
investigation, authorities said Wednesday.
   One woman was in custody and a man was being sought, said
Customs Service spokesman Michael Sheehan.
   Computerized missile guidance equipment known as isolators and
circulators was shipped from a Boynton Beach company York Ltd. to
Telecom Industries of South Africa, Sheehan said.
   ``These are for large-scale ballistic missiles, not
hand-launched rockets,'' said Sheehan. ``And these particular items
were built to military specification - there is little question in
our mind as to its ultimate use.''
   South Africa is believed to be on the verge of nuclear
capability. Last year, the white-minority ruled country reportedly
tested a modified version of the Israeli-made Jericho II
medium-range missile at Armaston on the Indian Ocean coast near
Capetown.
   The United States has had an arms embargo against South Africa
since 1964 to protest its apartheid system.
   Arrested at her Delray Beach home Tuesday night was Beverly
Barratt, 59. A federal magistrate in West Palm Beach set bond
Wednesday at $50,000, but Ms. Barratt could not immediately make
bail, said Charles Dodge, the Customs investigations supervisor who
led the investigation.
   Customs agents were seeking the Dutch owner of York Ltd.,
Reginald Van Rossum, 48, of Ocean Ridge.
   A search of the company headquarters last month uncovered
records indicating similar parts had been bought previously in the
United States and shipped to South Africa.
   The company did not have a license to order some of the military
items and falsely told U.S. manufacturers that the equipment was to
be shipped to the Netherlands instead of South Africa, Customs
agents said.
   ``The importance of this case lies in the technology involved
and the fact it was going to South Africa,'' Sheehan said. The
equipment could legally have been shipped to the Netherlands, he
added, but only if York had U.S. permits, which it lacked.
   If convicted of violating the Arms Export Control Act, the two
could face maximum terms of 10 years in prison and a $1 million
fine.
   The announcement of the charges came only a day after the State
Department said it would welcome reported statements by South
African officials that their government was willing to sign the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

<HEAD>Retiree Launches Campaign to Vote Out Every Member of Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A self-described ``working stiff'' is so fed
up with Congress' handling of the savings and loan crisis that he's
founded an organization bent on voting every member out.
   THRO Inc. - which stands for Throw the Hypocritical Rascals Out
- has picked up more than 20,000 followers from across the United
States, says its founder Jack Gargan, who adds he has been flooded
with letters, donations and a request to appear on television's
``Late Night with David Letterman.''
   ``Everything's happening too fast to keep up with,'' said
Gargan, who began the campaign about two months ago by spending
$9,000 of his retirement money to buy a full-page ad in the St.
Petersburg Times.
   ``I'm really hacked off that Congress has permitted, and in some
cases, actually abetted, the S&amp;L rip-off which will now cost every
American family an estimated extra $30 per month for the next 30
years,'' the ad read in part.
   The money started rolling in after that first advertisement,
allowing THRO to buy others in newspapers across the nation.
Ninety-seven ads later, Gargan has been flooded with letters from
people pledging from $1 to $100 in support.
   Gargan estimated contributions have reached $200,000, which he's
used to pay for more advertisements, telephone bills and paperwork.
   The money is placed in his non-profit group's bank account,
which will be audited annually, he said.
   Now Gargan and his staff of 40 volunteers are looking ahead to
the 1992 elections. They plan to register their fellow
disillusioned to vote and starting booting out incumbents.
   ``We're not endorsing any specific candidates,'' he said. ``We
just want to start from a clean slate. Anybody we can get can't do
any worse.''

<TEXT>
   Advocates for the city's homeless protested on
Wednesday the construction of an iron fence to prevent people from
camping on a steam grate outside the Justice Department.
   About a dozen protestors shouted ``take down the fence'' and
``ain't too late to save our grate'' outside the entrance used by
visitors to the office of Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   ``It's just really barbaric and stupid,'' said homeless advocate
Carol Fennelly. ``You don't find people freezing to death on
heating grates.''
   During the cold months, a small number of homeless people have
camped atop the steam grate, located just yards from the entrance.
   Justice Department security chief D. Jerry Rubino said the fence
was being built as a security precaution because the grate covers a
steam tunnel to the agency's headquarters and other government
buildings nearby.
   ``The steam grate represented a security vulnerability,'' Rubino
said. He also said that homeless people living on the grate had
``posed health problems for maintenance personnel.''
   Rubino noted that the General Services Administration had alrady
installed alarms on the steam grate to notify security officers of
any instrusion.
   The fence, topped with sharp spikes, is nearly complete, except
for a gate, which Fennelly said was taken away Wednesday by a group
of people who drove off with it on the back of a truck.
   Rubino said he didn't know what happened to the gate, saying it
wasn't taken away by workmen.

   President F.W. de Klerk,
responding to criticism from blacks that he is not doing enough to
quell factional violence, said Wednesday he will appoint special
units to investigate four recent incidents.
   He also announced an amnesty for individuals or organizations
turning in illegal firearms and explosives by Oct. 1, and offered
rewards of up to $40,000 for information leading to discovery of
such weapons.
   Black leaders have called for independent inquiries into police
shootings and other incidents during more than five weeks of unrest
in black townships around Johannesburg that has killed almost 800
people.
   Wednesday's announcement followed new police measures declared
last week, including reinforcements, roadblocks, weapons searches
and equipping police vehicles with machine-guns.
   African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela has predicted
the previous measures would be ineffective. He also has said the
ANC, the largest black opposition movement, might break off talks
with the white-led government if security forces cannot stop the
bloodshed.
   There was no immediate response from the ANC on Wednesday. Its
leadership met for a second day and announced it would meet again
Thursday. A statement would be issued at the end of the meeting, it
said.
   Speaking on the eve of his first anniversary in office, de Klerk
told a news conference that special units led by deputy attorneys
general would investigate four incidents: a police shooting this
month that killed 11 people in the Sebokeng township, two attacks
on train stations in Johannesburg that killed more than 30 people,
and an alleged ambush that killed a policeman.
   The president also said he was considering appointing an
independent investigator to handle allegations of misconduct by
``government institutions, organizations or by individuals.''
   Much of the fighting has pitted Xhosas and other blacks linked
to the ANC against Zulus loyal to the conservative Inkatha
movement. ANC and other black leaders have accused police of
favoring Inkatha, and called for a purge of right-wing elements
from security forces.
   Inkatha and the ANC oppose apartheid but differ on tactics and
plans for a future South Africa. Their power struggle in the
eastern province of Natal has claimed about 5,000 lives since 1986.
   Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said Wednesday the allied
ANC and South African Communist Party were seeking a
``winner-takes-all'' victory in a bid to create a future one-party
state in South Africa.
   He also issued a statement praising de Klerk's first year in
office, saying the president had ``done more to bring about a new
and stable South Africa than all his predecessors.''
   De Klerk has pledged to wipe out the apartheid system of racial
segregation and white dominance. His government and the ANC have
held talks on ending apartheid and sharing power with the black
majority.
   The talks could be harmed by the government's prosecution of
Mandela's wife, Winnie. The government announced Tuesday that it
planned to try her on charges of kidnapping and assault for the
1988 abduction and beating of four young men.
   Mrs. Mandela said Wednesday she was detained by police for about
three hours after handing over spent cartridges from an assault
rifle given to her by residents of Tokoza township. She accused
police of harassing her and her husband.
   ``The whole idea really is to undermine the ANC,'' she said.
   The ANC said it ``condemns the harassment meted out to Mrs.
Winnie Mandela'' by police ``intent on curbing the normal activity
of the ANC.''
   Mrs. Mandela was traveling in her white Mercedes Benz through
Tokoza township when she was stopped at a police roadblock. ``Mrs.
Mandela apparently picked up the shells while visiting,'' said
police spokeswoman Capt. Ida van Zweel. ``She handed them to a
policeman. There is no crime involved.''
   In the 1988 incident, four young men were abducted and beaten at
Mrs. Mandela's house, according to court testimony.
   One of them was killed, and the head of Mrs. Mandela's former
bodyguard unit, Jerry Richardson, has been convicted of murder,
kidnapping and assault. The three survivors testified Mrs. Mandela
beat them with a whip. She has denied wrongdoing.
   Mrs. Mandela faces four counts of kidnapping and four counts of
assault and is expected to be formally charged Monday.

   The House on Wednesday approved a $283 billion
defense bill that would make wholesale cuts in President Bush's
fiscal 1991 budget request for the Strategic Defense Initiative and
B-2 stealth bomber.
   Voting along party lines, the House adopted the military
blueprint for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 despite the threat
of a presidential veto and sharp differences with the
Senate-approved bill.
   The vote was 256-155 with 33 Republicans joining 223 Democrats
in passing the bill. Twenty Democrats and 135 Republicans opposed
the legislation.
   Among the major provisions of the bill is a $2.4 billion cut in
Bush's $4.7 billion proposal for SDI, a halt in production of the
B-2 bomber and a reduction of 129,500 troops.
   House and Senate members will meet later this month to thrash
out a final defense bill. Last month, the Senate approved a $289
billion military bill that left the president's B-2 request intact
and trimmed $1 billion from SDI.
   Further revisions in the measure could come if congressional and
White House negotiators break their impasse over how to pare the
federal deficit and at the same time decide on a final defense
total for fiscal 1991.
   House Democrats argued that their bill reflects a lessening
Soviet threat to the West while trying to assist the military
prepare for conflicts in the Third World, including Iraq.
   ``It takes the first step toward buying the right defense for a
new era,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee.
   Republicans accused their colleagues of business as usual -
filling the defense bill with pet projects for their constituents
back home while undermining the men and women in uniform.
   ``It's a bad bill. It should be voted down and the president is
going to veto it,'' said Rep. Bill Dickinson of Alabama, ranking
Republican on the Armed Services panel.
   The sharpest exchanges came on a measure by Dickinson to alter
the troop cut in the bill and eliminate millions of dollars the
panel added for weapons key to some Democrats.
   ``To the young men and women sitting in Saudi Arabia trying to
defend their country, what message is the House going to send them
- that pork-barrel in the form of F-18s are more important than
human beings,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., a member of the GOP
leadership.
   The amendment sponsored by Dickinson would have revised the
troop cut in the House bill to 101,000 instead of 129,500 while
cutting out money for the F-18 fighter planes.
   The measure failed along a party-line vote, 254-156.
   In final day action on the bill, the House also approved a $978
million package to assist the military buildup in the Persian Gulf
aimed at stopping Iraqi aggression. The vote was 413-10.
   The measure includes $185 million in pay and other benefits for
military personnel, $250 million for three fast sea lift ships and
$187 million for chemical and biological equipment and training.
   The measure also requires Congress to authorize funds received
from U.S. allies to defray the cost of the military buildup, which
could rise to $15 billion next year.
   A 1954 law allows the Treasury secretary to spend donations on
defense without congressional review or approval.
   The House action came as elsewhere on Capitol Hill Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney asked lawmakers to let the Pentagon accept
and spend allied donations without prior approval from Congress.
   Among the major aspects of the House bill are:
   -Approximately $2.3 billion for SDI, the anti-missile shield
commonly known as Star Wars. The Senate approved $3.7 billion for
the program and after the House-Senate conference a total of $3
billion will likely emerge.
   -An end to production of the B-2 bomber, the costliest aircraft
in history at nearly $865 million a plane, after the 15 aircraft
currently under construction. Bush had sought $4.6 billion for two
of the bat-winged planes and advanced procurement of parts for six
more in fiscal 1992.
   -Elimination of the $1.6 billion Bush sought for moving the
multiple-warhead MX missile from fixed silos to railroad cars and
$202 million in research on the single-warhead Midgetman missile.
Instead, the House created a $610 million fund for developing the
next generation of intercontinental missiles.
   -A reduction of 129,500 in military personnel. The total
reduction from the nearly 2.1 million troops is slightly higher
than the 100,000 approved by the Senate and nearly four times the
38,000 in the president's proposed budget.
   -One of two Seawolf attack submarines Bush had sought and $1.2
billion for the 18th Trident missile-launching submarine.
   -Rejection of Cheney's second attempt in two years to cancel the
V-22 Osprey by adding $403 million for the tilt-rotor assault
transport aircraft.

<HEAD>Lukanov Announces New Gov't, Longtime Defensive Chief Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andrei Lukanov on Wednesday
announced a new government that contains only one non-Socialist and
ends the 28-year tenure of Defense Minister Dobri Dzhurov.
   Lukanov provided a list of new ministers but failed to name
heads of several departments.
   The remaining ministers were expected to be nominated Thursday
when the Grand National Assembly is to vote on Lukanov's second
government in seven months.
   Dzhurov, a longtime associate of ousted Communist Party chief
Todor Zhivkov, had been defense chief since 1962.
   But while he has been widely associated with the Zhivkov's
orthdox Communist rule, the general was credited with helping
remove Zhivkov last fall.
   Dzhurov was replaced by Yordan Mutafchiev.
   The proposed government roster contained only a handful of new
names, all of them former Communists with the exception of new
Science Minister Ilya Konev from Blagoevgrad, who is nationally
unknown and without party affiliation.
   Besides Konev and Mutafchiev, other new Cabinet members include
deputy Premier Georgi Pirinski, Foreign Minister Lyuben Ghotsev,
and Atanas Paparisov, minister for external economic relations.
   The BTA news agency said Lukanov did not announce his choices
for the ministries of justice, the economy and industry.
   ``We have not managed to set up a government of national
consensus and trust the country would have needed,'' Lukanov, a
51-year-old moderate reformer in the Socialist Party, the former
Communist Party, told Parliament.
   Lukanov repeatedly had refused to put together an all-Socialist
Cabinet, but the opposition rejected the idea of joining a broad
coalition.
   The main opposition group, the Union of Democratic Forces, has
said that its demands for participating in the Cabinet were
unacceptable to the Socialists.
   The opposition seeks immediate privatization of land and
industry, and return of land to those who owned it before it was
collectivized under communist rule. The Socialists agree to land
reform, but say the land should be given to those who now till it.
   Lukanov said his government would not act as one dominated by a
single party, but as a government of national understanding.
Socialist Party members in the government would act as if they did
not belong to the party, he said.
   Repeating the opposition's criticism of the ruling party, Stoyan
Ganev, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, called on
the Socialists to assume responsibility of the past Communist
regime.
   At a rally on Monday, Dimiter Ludzhev, the deputy opposition
floor leader, also called on the former Communists to quit.
   Ludzhev warned that the opposition would be seeking new
elections soon.
   In the first free multiparty elections in Bulgaria in 58 years,
which were held in June, the Socialists won a majority with 211
seats in the 400-seat Parliament. The opposition mustered 144.
   But since then, the Bulgarian economy has slid seriously. Some
basic foodstuffs and key consumer goods are in short supply or
unavailable, and the government began rationing sugar, cooking oil
and other goods this summer.

<HEAD>Appeals Judge in North Case Assigned to Poindexter Panel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of two judges who voted to set aside the
Iran-Contra convictions of Oliver L. North has been assigned to the
panel that will hear the appeal of former national security adviser
John M. Poindexter.
   Circuit Judge David Sentelle will sit on the panel reviewing
Poindexter's convictions along with judges Abner Mikva and Douglas
H. Ginsburg, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here said in an
order made public Wednesday.
   In July, Sentelle joined Judge Laurence Silberman in setting
aside North's three Iran-Contra convictions.
   The judges ordered a hearing to determine if references to the
testimony that North gave Congress under a grant of limited
immunity from prosecution had unfairly seeped into the former White
House aide's trial.
   Poindexter, convicted of five counts of lying and obstructing
congressional investigations of the Iran-Contra affair, was given a
six-month sentence but is free pending appeal.
   Both Poindexter and North testified before congressional
committees about the Iran-Contra affair under immunity grants that
bar prosecutors from using what they said as evidence against them.
   The appeals court gave Poindexter until Dec. 14 to file his
appeals brief and set arguments on the case for Feb. 28.
   Last month, Poindexter tried unsuccessfully to have his case
assigned to the same panel that set aside North's convictions.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, meanwhile, has asked the
appellate court to reconsider its decision on the North case.
   North was ordered to perform 1,200 hours of community service
and fined $150,000 for his three felony convictions.

<HEAD>Deer Hunter Attacked by Bear, Swatted ``Like a Badminton Birdie''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRON RIVER, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A deer hunter says he was jumped by a
black bear that picked him up and ``swatted me like a badminton
birdie,'' but he escaped with only minor injuries and a good scare.
   Tom Walsh, of Iron River, said the attack occurred over the
weekend in the Long Lake area of the Chequamegon National Forest in
northern Wisconsin while he was hunting deer with a bow.
   Walsh, 29, noticed a bear was feeding on corn that was set out
for deer. Cautiously, he checked for other bears and counted six.
   Then suddenly he was the target of a male bear he hadn't
spotted.
   ``He grabbed a hold of me, picked me up and swatted me like a
badminton birdie. That's exactly what it felt like,'' Walsh said,
guessing the bear's weight at 325 pounds.
   He estimated the bear hurled him 10 to 15 feet.
   Walsh said he put his hands over the back of his head, played
dead and the bear came over and rolled him on his back.
   ``He drooled in my face and snorted. It smelled like death
warmed over,'' Walsh said. The bear then ambled away, allowing
Walsh to escape.
   Walsh was treated at an Ashland hospital for a sprained ankle,
cracked ribs, a slightly bruised kidney and a claw mark on one leg.
   Black bears normally shy away from people.
   Game Warden Mark DiSalvo said it was hard to say why the bear
attacked Walsh.
   Perhaps the animal was protecting its food or ``it just picked
up Walsh's scent too late and was startled,'' DiSalvo said. ``I've
been that close to bears before and have never been attacked.''
   Walsh said he returned to bow hunting Monday.
   ``I wanted to get right back in the woods because this scared
the devil out of me,'' he said. ``But it's like riding a bike.
You've got to get right back on when you fall off.''

<TEXT>
   King Hassan II met with the leaders of
Jordan and Algeria on Wednesday, and in a private peace initiative
the three sought common ground on the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Hassan personally welcomed King Hussein of Jordan and President
Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria at Rabat airport. They drove in
separate convoys to the king's summer residence at Shkirat, 25
miles away.
   The trio met behind closed doors late into the night. Officials
would not say whether the talks would continue Thursday, and there
was no immediate word on any outcome.
   Hassan invited Bendjedid and Hussein to discuss the outline of a
peace plan he hopes will overcome the rift in the Arab world over
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and later annexation of the
oil-wealthy emirate, officials said.
   They said the talks might be expanded to include other Arab
leaders who have not endorsed Western military intervention in
Saudi Arabia.
   These leaders could include Col. Moammar Gadhafi of Libya,
Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat and
President Abdullah Salah of Yemen, officials said.
   Moroccan officials said Hassan's compromise had some chance of
success because it has ``not been rejected thus far by the United
States, the Soviet Union or even by Saddam Hussein.''
   The officials said the plan urges the following:
   Total Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, a summit of all Arab leaders
including the Iraqi president, withdrawal of non-Arab troops from
Saudi Arabia, a ``privileged relationship'' between Iraq and
Kuwait, and a Middle East peace conference that includes Lebanon
and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, rejected
the last two points, which he said ``would reward Saddam Hussein
for his acts of aggression.''
   In Taif, Saudi Arabia, the Kuwaiti government-in-exile issued a
statement rejecting any mediation efforts.
   Kuwait's Crown Prince Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah said this
was because his government was ``convinced that such attempts were
futile in the face of Saddam Hussein's defiance of the Arab,
Islamic and international will.''
   The Morocco meeting brought together three countries that have
taken markedly different stands since the crisis began.
   Morocco has sent 1,200 troops to Saudi Arabia to help Riyadh
deter any further attack by Iraqi forces. Hussein has aligned
himself more closely with Saddam.
   Algeria has chosen neutrality, trying to carry out the mediating
role conferred on it by the five-nation Arab Maghreb Union before
the invasion. The union also includes Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and
Mauritiania.
   Before leaving the Jordanian capital of Amman, Hussein conferred
with Arafat for the second time in less than 18 hours.
   Hussein was accompanied to Rabat by Premier Mudar Badran, who
said in a newspaper interview published Wednesday that the king was
keen on producing a ``collective'' plan on the gulf crisis.
   Badran said Hussein's own efforts to formulate a peace plan came
to a halt 10 days ago when Saddam told him that ``Iraq will not
pull out its forces from Kuwait.''

<HEAD>Thousands of Crossover Votes Thrown Out in Wisconsin Primary</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Mass Primary, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of votes cast in the state' Sept.
11 primary were thrown out because voters apparently didn't
understand they could elect only candidates from one party.
   The problem is being blamed on punch-card ballots, which are
used in about a third of Wisconsin's 72 counties. A ballot change
in 1986 appeared to clear up the problem in 1988, but it reappeared
in last week's primary.
   The number of disqualified ballots has brought renewed efforts
to change the state's closed primary system to a non-partisan
system.
   An Associated Press review found at least 5,500 of the estimated
400,000 ballots cast statewide - including more than 17 percent in
one county - were rejected because they violated Wisconsin's
closed-primary law. County clerks who provided the figures said the
total could be much higher because in some jurisdictions, the
number of disqualified ballots isn't counted.
   Statewide, the disqualified ballots amounted to 1.4 percent of
the total cast.
   ``It could make a difference in a close local race. I am
concerned about it. I always have been,'' Walworth County Clerk
Carol Krauklis said.
   In Jefferson County, the errors caused election officials to
discount 17.6 percent of the vote - including nearly half in the
village of Johnson Creek - leading to speculation that a close
sheriff's race may have been affected.
   ``The races could very well have been affected,'' said Jefferson
County Clerk Barbara A. Geyer. ``In the sheriff's race it was only
154 votes different.''
   Under Wisconsin's closed primary law, enacted in 1903, voters
may cast ballots in only one political party's races.
   Sen. Walter John Chilsen said he will introduce legislation for
a non-partisan primary system, arguing many voters stayed away from
the polls last week because they were turned off by the present
system.
   Only about 9 percent of the state's estimated 3.6 million
eligible voters cast ballots in the primary.
   ``I'm convinced the low turnout for primary elections is caused
in large part by the inflexibility of the closed primary process,''
Chilsen said.
   But closed primary proponents believe a return to open primaries
would encourage Republicans and Democrats to meddle in each other's
affairs and try to nominate weak opposition candidates, said Rupert
Theobald, director of the Legislative Reference Bureau.
   ``The argument is that the purpose of the primary is to permit a
party to select its nominees,'' Theobald said.
   Most votes rejected in the Sept. 11 election were punch-card
ballots, in which voters punch out a space near the name of the
candidate of their choice.
   The ballots list both Democrat and Republican races. Critics say
such ballots lead some to believe they can vote in both races.
   Voting machines, paper ballots and electronically scanned
ballots used in other counties have safeguards to prevent voters
from voting for both Democrats and Republicans in a primary.
   Punch-card ballots have been permitted in the state since 1980.
Cities using punch-card ballots in 1984 disqualified an average of
8 percent to 25 percent, said Kevin Kennedy, executive director of
the state Elections Board.
   Since 1986, voters can identify their party on the ballot. Then
counting machines cancel votes given to a candidate from another
party. Crossover voters who don't identify their party have their
entire ballot disqualified, however.
   The state doesn't have a count yet on disqualified ballots from
last week.
   Kennedy said he suspects errant ballots probably result from
complicated ballot instructions and a lack of explanation from
polling place workers.
   ``The voters may not have understood the instructions and that's
not a slam against the voters. The wording of the instructions can
be easily criticized,'' Kennedy said.

<TEXT>
   The Magellan spacecraft completed its
30th consecutive orbit mapping the cracked, volcanic landscape of
Venus on Wednesday, despite some ``hiccups'' from one of its
computers, NASA said.
   ``Since Venus is almost the same size as Earth, the 30-orbit
image patch ... would drape an area on Earth extending from Los
Angeles to Albuquerque and from the North Pole to nearly the South
Pole,'' said a statement by the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The orbiter resumed using its radar to make pictures of the
cloud-covered planet on Saturday, a month after it yielded its
first images during an Aug. 16 radar test. Engineers temporarily
lost radio contact the night of that test, then again on Aug. 21.
   They still haven't identified the cause of the problem, and the
spacecraft continues to have occasional malfunctions, nicknamed
``hiccups'' by the engineers, said Steve Wall, Magellan experiment
representative.
   ``It's a sign there's still something awry. ... But we've made
it (Magellan) so it can still map'' and recover from any future
communications blackout, he added.
   Magellan and Venus were 155.8 million miles from Earth on
Wednesday. Magellan was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on May
4, 1989.
   Before mapping resumed Saturday, Magellan played back a tape
recording of some of the picture data collected Aug. 16. Steve
Saunders, the project's chief scientist, displayed a few of thoe
pictures Wednesday during a NASA briefing, but prints weren't
released publicly.
   The pictures show the same kind of features seen in other
images: ridges, valleys, extensive networks of intersecting seismic
faults, large solidified flows of lava, a volcanic dome and
calderas, the craters left by the collapse of large volcanos.
   The spacecraft's most recent computer glitch happened Monday
night, when the backup to Magellan's main computer got a set of
false alerts from the backup computer that helps point Magellan.
The spacecraft wasn't operating on either backup computer, so
mapping continued.
   Wall said there seems to be a common factor linking that and
other glitches, including both communications failures and lesser
malfunctions on Aug. 10 and Sept. 4 - they all involved the backup
pointing computer.

<HEAD>Woman Left Homeless After Home Auctioned to Pay $530 Tax Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elderly woman was left homeless after
authorities auctioned off her home to pay a tax bill her lawyers
say should never have been levied.
   Mary Amaro, 78, has been living out of her Buick since sheriff's
deputies evicted her from her modest home in late August.
   The mess began years ago when the city mistakenly billed her for
$530 for business taxes for 1983-84, Amaro's attorneys said
Tuesday.
   Ever since, Amaro paid her property tax bills on time and in
cash, but she never paid the business tax because she maintained
that she'd never operated a business or rented her home.
   ``She went to city hall and signed a paper swearing she had
never operated a business or rented her home,'' said Amaro's niece,
Belmira Dutra. ``She thought that took care of it.''
   Last May, Alameda County auctioned Amaro's home for $47,000. On
Aug. 28, sheriff's deputies locked her out.
   City officials declined to comment on the case.
   Amaro has shunned reporters since word of her plight appeared in
news reports Tuesday. Dutra said her aunt leaves her ``mobile
home'' parked in front of her former house only to report to work
as a domestic worker.
   ``She took food from her mouth to send us money so we could come
here,'' said Dutra, who emigrated from Portugal with Amaro's help.
``She cared for her invalid husband 10 years and still found money
to send back to the family. But from us, she takes nothing.''
   Attorneys with the Legal Aid Society of Alameda County have
threatened to file a lawsuit if necessary to rescind the sale.
   ``At this point, the city and county would gladly rescind the
sale,'' but it hinges on approval of the new owner, said Legal Aid
attorney Laurie Gong. She added that the new owner, Mohamed Mosleh,
was reconsidering his earlier refusals to consider giving Amaro
back the house.
   ``When the government is selling property, you have to assume
the government knows what it is doing,'' said Mosleh's attorney,
Peter Kerman.
   Others expressed dismay at Amaro's saga.
   ``However it happened, it should never have happened,'' said
Lindy Graham, an administrative assistant for Alameda County
Supervisor Don Perata. ``Her property was sold for what might well
turn out to be an error.''

   President Bush warned Saddam Hussein on
Wednesday the United States will take tougher action against Iraq
if sanctions and diplomacy fail to work. He said demands for Iraq's
withdrawal from Kuwait were non-negotiable.
   Bush said the United States, joined by other nations, is
``standing firm and unyielding in the distant desert sands''
against the Iraqi president.
   In a speech winding up a two-day campaign trip, the president
called anew for Iraq to withdraw its invading army from Kuwait,
restore the country's exiled leaders and release all foreign
hostages.
   ``If Iraq does not meet these non-negotiable conditions,'' Bush
said, ``then its isolation will not end. And we are, as I've said
before, prepared to take additional steps if sanctions and the
quest for a political resolution do not work.''
   He did not specify what additional steps are being contemplated,
and his warning did not go beyond a single sentence in his prepared
remarks. White House aides said the comment was not intended as a
new signal but reinforced earlier statements.
   With more than 150,000 U.S. combat troops in the Persian Gulf,
Bush has refused to rule out the possibility of military action.
Moreover, contingency plans for waging war against Iraq have been
publicly discussed by Gen. Mike Dugan, whose comments were deemed
an indiscretion and led to his firing as Air Force chief of staff.
   Bush's threat against Iraq echoed a warning from the Helsinki
summit between the president and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   They agreed that the superpowers ``are prepared to consider''
additional, unspecified action against Iraq unless it pulled out of
Kuwait. However, Gorbachev appeared far more resistant than Bush to
possible military action.
   In his speech here, Bush hailed the global cooperation against
Iraq.
   ``The unity of outrage across the globe, the depth of support in
the gulf and the ferocity of condemnation in the United Nations are
unprecedented,'' the president said.
   He said Saddam has been put on notice by ``the extraordinary
joint declaration'' that Bush signed with Gorbachev.
   ``It is an absolutely unparalleled message of solidarity, a
clarion call for Iraq to comply, immediately and completely, with
the five resolutions which had been so urgently ordered by the U.N.
Security Council,'' Bush said.
   `And it heralds a new era for our world: the Soviet Union and
the United States standing together in vigorous condemnation of an
outrageous aggression.''
   He said the gulf crisis had forged a ``new partnership for
peace, a united world response to Iraq's aggressive ambition.''
   Bush's appearance here, and a stop in Los Angeles, were intended
to raise between $1.5 million and $2 million for Sen. Pete Wilson,
who is locked in a close race for governor with former San
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein.
   Environmental issues have been a major focus of the campaign,
and Bush underscored that theme in his speech.
   Wilson has ardently supported coastal protection, bucking both
the Reagan and Bush White Houses, and championed forestry and river
protection as well. He has won the backing of environmental groups
that traditionally would be expected to back the Democratic
nominee.
   Wilson won the endorsement of Friends of the River and the
Western River Guides Association.
   Feinstein has been endorsed by the Sierra Club. The League of
Conservation Voters has yet to announce an endorsement.
   Speaking of Wilson, Bush said, ``His brand of environmental
activism is the kind California needs.''
   Before returning to Washington, Bush taped some public service
announcements urging a big voter turnout on Nov. 6.
   Bush also used the occasion to prod Congress anew to reach
agreement with the White House on a deficit-reduction agreement.
   ``No domestic issue has been more on our minds of late than our
economy, and it remains an absolutely critical imperative that we
reach a bipartisan agreement immediately,'' he said.

   Canadian authorities on
Wednesday called off the search for a Peruvian jetliner that
reported it was running out of fuel and disappeared off
Newfoundland with 16 people aboard.
   Maj. Walter Chipchase, a spokesman for the Search and Rescue
Center in Halifax, Nova Scotia, said ships and planes would no
longer be assigned to search for the Faucett Airlines Boeing 727,
which vanished on Sept. 11.
   The plane was returning to Miami from Malta when it disappeared
about 180 miles south of Cape Race, Newfoundland.
   ``Although there is no dedicated search, a notice to shipping
bulletin has been issued asking mariners to report any suspicious
material or debris that may be associated with the incident,'' said
Chipchase.
   Military aircraft from Canada, the United States and Britain
participated in the search. Faucett is a Lima-based carrier.

   A Brazilian appeals court on Wednesday
unanimously rejected a motion to free two accused killers of Amazon
rubber tapper leader Chico Mendes.
   Federal court spokesman Manoel Martins said the court ruled
``without merit'' the argument of lawyers representing cattle
rancher Darli Alves da Silva and his son, Darci Alves Pereira.
   The ruling means the pair will go on trial Oct. 25 in the
backwoods Amazon town of Xapuri, where Mendes was gunned down after
he stepped out of his home on Dec. 22, 1988.
   Mendes, a leader of the rubber tappers labor movement, which
seeks to prevent the destruction of the rainforest, has been the
subject of international attention since receiving the United
Nation's Global 500 award for his work in defense of the
environment.
   Several books have been written about him, and at least one
movie is in the works.

   Israel will fight a proposed $18 billion U.S.
arms sale to Saudi Arabia unless it in turn gets $1 billion in
emergency American aid to confront threats from Iraq and to counter
growing Saudi might, officials said Wednesday.
   Israel has already started mobilizing its congressional
supporters, who met Tuesday with visiting Defense Minister Moshe
Arens.
   The Israeli position could put it on a collision course with the
Bush administration, which is trying to restrain federal spending
and at the same time bolster Saudi Arabia against Iraq's superior
military strength.
   Israel's supporters on Capitol Hill have already attacked the
proposed Saudi sale as unbalanced and disproportionate to the Iraqi
threat. Others in Congress say pumping vast amounts of arms into
the volatile region increases the prospects for conflict there.
   Seeking to ease Israeli concerns, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
told Arens on Tuesday that the United States will give Israel 15
F-15A fighter jets, 10 helicopters and 2 Patriot anti-missile
systems, said officials familiar with the situation. They spoke
only on condition of anonymity.
   ``That's just not adequate,'' said one source. ``There's grave
dissatisfaction with this Saudi sale.''
   Israel needs $1 billion immediately to buy more sophisticated
planes and other state-of-the-art equipment to match the Saudi
package, said the source. Saudi Arabia financially supports the
Palestine Liberation Organization and other Israeli foes.
   In addition, Arens asked Cheney for a $700 million increase in
the annual $1.8 billion military aid Israel gets from the United
States, said the source.
   The additional U.S. aid would be used to strengthen Israel's own
defense industries in order to make the small country more
self-reliant.
   ``Nothing was finalized'' at the Cheney-Arens meetings, said
Israeli Embassy spokeswoman Ruth Yaron. ``They decided the dialogue
would continue.''
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger told Congress on
Wednesday the administration was still putting together a package
for Israel to balance the sale to the Saudis.
   There is ``a whole list of things being discussed'' he told the
House Appropriations foreign aid subcommittee.
   He said one item of aid, $400 million in loan guarantees for
Israel to build homes for Soviet Jews, should be worked out by next
week. Israel's defense budget has been feeling the crunch of
hundreds of thousands of Soviet immigrants arriving in recent
months.
   Arens argued here this week that Israel - greatly outnumbered by
its Arab enemies - has been weakened in recent years because the
United States sells the Arabs everything it sells the Israelis.
   Cheney and his aides were taken aback by the Israeli request
that Arens made Monday, and invited the Israeli defense official
for a second meeting Tuesday, said one source.
   At the second meeting, Cheney offered Israel the F-15s and the
helicopters.
   U.S. officials don't perceive Israel as being in danger from
Iraq at present, said the source, while Israel feels more
threatened every day.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has threatened to attack Israel
with chemical weapons if the United States attacks his country.
   The Iraqi threat has also prompted Israel to seek forgiveness
for its $4.5 billion debt to the United States if Washington erases
Egypt's loans. Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai will put the request
to U.S. officials formally next week.
   President Bush has recommended that Egypt's $6.7 billion debt be
forgiven to help it cover expenses incurred in the gulf crisis.
   Eagleburger made it clear debt forgiveness would not be extended
to Israel, which is in ``different circumstances'' than Egypt on
that score.
   With over $3 billion in overall aid annually, Israel is the
largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid.

   Mormon Church President Ezra Taft Benson
underwent surgery Wednesday to remove two blood clots on his brain.
   His surgeon termed the operation a success but said it was too
early to tell if the 91-year-old church leader had suffered brain
damage.
   ``The ultimate outcome in a 91-year-old person we never know,
but he's doing very well,'' Dr. Bruce F. Sorensen, a neurosurgeon,
said after the 2{-hour procedure at LDS Hospital.
   Sorensen said he removed clots on each side of Benson's brain
that were 1{ to 2 centimeters thick and covered ``a significant
portion of his head,'' compressing the brain.
   ``He came through the surgery very well,'' the surgeon said.
   Benson was listed in serious but stable condition in intensive
care and will be hospitalized for seven or eight days if all goes
well, Sorensen said. He said the clots formed within the past week,
but family members didn't know of any falls or injuries that might
have caused them.
   The doctor's main concern was that new clots could accumulate.
   He said the ailment could have a ``significant'' impact on
Benson's mental capacity, but that cannot immediately be
determined.
   Benson had experienced difficulty in swallowing and had severe
headaches in the days before he was admitted to the hospital
Tuesday, when his swallowing became more labored, the surgeon said.
   When Benson was hospitalized for four days in June with a
bacterial infection, a brain scan showed him free of such clots.
   Benson, who was agriculture secretary in the administration of
President Eisenhower, became president of The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1986.
   Presidents of the 7.5 million-member church serve for life.
   Sorensen said he didn't think Benson would be able to attend the
church's semiannual General Conference on Oct. 6.
   Benson had a heart pacemaker implanted in 1987.

<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top U.S. official for Africa
went behind Liberian rebel lines Wednesday to meet with rebel chief
Charles Taylor and said the man many accuse of prolonging a brutal
war is ``in a negotiating mood.''
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen met Taylor across the
border from Ivory Coast, a day after he risked his life to meet
rival guerrilla leader Prince Johnson in the Liberian capital of
Monrovia, where bullets flew over his head.
   ``The prospects for increased warfare are growing,'' Cohen said
at a news conference in Abidjan. ``I feel the situation in Liberia
is deteriorating. More and more people are in danger of starvation
and death from diseases, especially a growing cholera threat.''
   Cohen described the ``catastrophe'' of Liberia's 9-month-old war
to reporters a few hours after a five-nation West African army sent
to enforce a cease-fire in Monrovia announced ``a total offensive''
against the warring rebel factions.
   The task force's commander, Lt. Gen. Arnold Quainoo of Ghana,
made the announcement in Lagos, Nigeria, saying he had ``received a
new mandate to intervene actively'' instead of keeping with the
task force's original peacekeeping mission.
   Ghanaian and Nigerian jets bombed Taylor's artillery positions
in Monrovia suburbs during the weekend. They were retaliating for
Taylor's shelling of the West African headquarters in the Monrovia
port with shells. Two Ghanaian sailors and three Nigerian medical
workers were killed in the attack.
   Cohen said his mission was to persuade the rebel chiefs to
negotiate a peaceful settlement.
   He met Taylor at Luguatuo, a Liberian border post near Ivory
Coast's western border town of Man.
   Taylor began the war with a Dec. 24 invasion from Ivory Coast to
topple Doe, and is considered the key to peace. Since Doe died in
the hands of Johnson's faction two weeks ago, Taylor has demanded
the withdrawal of the 3,000 West African troops as a condition for
peace talks.
   ``I have the feeling that Charles Taylor is prepared to
negotiate everything,'' Cohen said. ``I think he feels that peace
is more important than war.''
   He said both rebel leaders told him ``they would like to see
Liberia with a truly democratic system and would cooperate in
organizing that.''
   Johnson has embraced plans of the West African Economic
Community, which sent the task force to help install an interim
government and organize fair elections. But Taylor says the West
Africans want a puppet government.
   Cohen said he also was traveling around the region to assess the
magnitude of the Liberian crisis and report to President Bush for a
review of U.S. policy and aid to the war-ravaged nation.
   ``When I was in Monrovia I saw large columns of smoke indicating
that large sections of Monrovia had been burned down deliberately
by the troops of the late President (Samuel) Doe,'' Cohen said.
   ``The city of Monrovia may be destroyed when this is over,'' he
said.
   He announced that Bush had increased aid for the half-million
Liberians who have fled to neighboring states, including $2.3
million for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and $1.8
million for relief groups including the International Committee of
the Red Cross.
   This was in addition to $1.6 million already pledged for
refugees. The United States also is sending another 39,200 tons of
rice, Cohen said.
   He would not say whether Washington was considering giving aid
to the West African army, which includes troops from Sierra Leone,
Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea and Gambia.
   ``Everything is going to be reviewed when I get back,'' he said.
   However, he said U.S. troops would not intervene.
   Many prominent Liberians have criticized Washington for refusing
calls, including ones from Doe, to intervene. Critics say Americans
are watching from the sidelines while innocent people die. More
than 5,000 civilians have been killed.
   The 2,100 U.S. Marines sent to Liberia's coast have evacuated
hundreds of foreigners and are guarding U.S. installations,
including a ship-tracking station for U.S. traffic in the Atlantic
and a Voice of America transmission station.
   Cohen departed Ivory Coast for Lagos.

   A United Airlines jetliner with 60 passengers was
evacuated with emergency chutes at Denver's Stapleton International
Airport on Wednesday after smoke filled part of the cabin.
   Two people were treated at a local hospital, one for smoke
inhalation and one for a jammed finger, and released, authorities
said.
   The Boeing 737, Flight 358, was en route to Wichita, Kan., and
was backing away from a loading gate shortly before noon when the
smoke appeared, said United spokesman Joe Hopkins.
   Two emergency chutes in the front of the plane were activated
and the plane was cleared, Hopkins said.
   ``It was a white smoke in the cabin,'' he said.
   ``The mechanics believe it to be an electrically caused smoke,
but there was no fire. The suspected problem is an overheated air
conditioning unit,'' Hopkins said.
   Hopkins said United substituted an airplane and the passengers
flew out on the second plane.

<HEAD>Oily Pit Killing Birds, Baffling Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAUKEGAN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Animals looking for food or a drink in
what looks deceptively like a pond are being killed by a sticky,
contaminated black muck, and officials trying to clean up the oily
pit are looking for someone to blame.
   The swampy pit in an industrial area 60 miles north of Chicago
holds a toxic chemical mixture that has snared scores of
unsuspecting animals.
   ``It is instant death,'' said U.S. Fish and Wildlife officer
John Brooks, who is studying the chemicals in the pit. ``It looks
just like a natural pond.''
   Eight blue herons, a beaver and several mallard ducs have been
coated with the black substance that looks and smells like tar
within the last year, according to Brooks and city animal control
officials.
   Blue herons ``make their living spearing fish. ... The bird will
land, sink down and get the stuff on itself. It will try to preen
or clean itself and it gets the stuff on its beak. Then it is all
over. Once it is on the bird it won't come off,'' Brooks said in a
telephone interview from his offices in Rosemont.
   Other animals probably have died in the pond and sunk out of
sight, Brooks said.
   Several industries once operated in the area surrounding the
pit, including a tannery, a concrete lamp pole manufacturer and a
North Shore Gas Co. gas plant. A railroad track runs beside the
pit.
   Because so many industries set up shop in the area, city
officials have been unable to find who dumped the chemical.
   ``I would like to have them clean it up voluntarily,'' said Jack
Simonian, the city's governmental service director. But no one has
come forward to do so, he said.
   The Northshore Sanitary District, which owns the 16 acres on
which the pit lies, is awaiting results of tests to identify the
contents of the pit to determine if filling it in is feasible.
   Wildlife advocates are uneasy about leaving the pit as it is.
   Andrea Kane, a wildlife expert in Woodstock who tried to save
two of the birds, said even if the animals had survived they would
be unable to lead a normal life.
   ``Oily substances and chemicals that are toxic can be absorbed
into the bird's system,'' Miss Kane said.
   ``I sincerely hope that they do something before a child falls
into it,'' she said.

<HEAD>IRA Admits Shooting Former Gibraltar Governor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAFFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army claimed
responsibility Wednesday for seriously wounding the man who was
governor of Gibraltar when British commandos killed three IRA
guerrillas there in 1988.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called the attack on Air Chief
Marshall Sir Peter Terry ``cowardly, wicked and evil.''
   Terry, 63, suffered at least nine bullet wounds when assailants
opened fire Tuesday night at his home in Milford, a village near
Stafford, 130 miles north of London.
   His wife, Lady Betty Terry, suffered an eye injury. Tom Storrow,
general manager of Staffordshire District General hospital, said
Mrs. Terry was in satisfactory condition.
   Storrow said Terry was stable Wednesday night after 5{ hours of
surgery for injuries including fractures to his right arm and right
leg and severe facial injuries. Terry also underwent a tracheotomy,
an operation on his windpipe, and was on a ventilator to help him
breathe.
   ``He is very lucky to be alive,'' said surgeon John Lotz.
   He said two bullets were removed from behind Terry's left eye.
   Mrs. Thatcher, on an official visit to Budapest, Hungary, said
the IRA was engaged in ``guerrilla warfare.''
   ``They are at war with us, and we can only fight them with the
civil law,'' she said. ``So they are acting under what they regard
as rules of war, and we are acting with the ordinary law of the
land. It is the action of terrorism.''
   The IRA, which is fighting to end British rule in Northern
Ireland, said in a statement issued in Dublin that the attack had
been carried out by one of its service units.
   The IRA this week claimed responsibility for Monday's shooting
of a British army sergeant in London, for an explosion at an army
recruiting office in Derby on Sept. 10 and for two thwarted bomb
attacks in August.
   Conservative Party lawmaker Ian Gow, a close friend of Mrs.
Thatcher's, was killed by an IRA bomb on July 30.
   Detective Chief Superintendent Malcolm Bevington of the
Staffordshire police said Terry was believed shot as he sat reading
in a rear ground-floor room. Mrs. Terry was in an adjoining room.
   Police believe shots were fired from a 9mm automatic machine
pistol through the window from the sidewalk outside.
   One of the bullets passed through an internal wall in the house,
injuring Mrs. Terry.
   Terry was governor of Gibraltar from 1985 until he retired last
year.
   On March 6, 1988, he signed a document allowing members of
Britain's Special Air Services, an elite counterinsurgency unit, to
mount an operation in Gibraltar during which they shot to death
three unarmed IRA guerrillas.

   Three drug agents who picked up a suspect
put him on ``trial'' in a courtroom, one serving as a judge and the
other two acting as the prosecutor and defense lawyer.
   They later dismissed the incident as a joke but the public
defender's office said it was a mockery of the judicial system.
   ``I've been a lawyer for 23 years, and I've seen all kinds of
things, but this is one of the most serious,'' said Public Defender
Joe DuRocher. ``It shows a disrespect, almost contempt, for the
judicial process.''
   The sheriff's office gave the agents written reprimands.
   The agents arrested Charles Chestnut, 35, at a hangout in this
Orlando suburb because a fourth agent had earlier bought what he
believed was cocaine from him. Chestnut said the officers drove him
around before taking him to the sheriff's office in Apopka.
   ``I thought they were going to whup me,'' Chestnut said Tuesday.
   The agents said Chestnut was drunk and kept asking to see a
judge.
   ``I'd say, `There's no judge - it's almost midnight,'' agent
David Ogden said. ``From where he was, he could see the courtroom
and the stand. That's how the joke got started. We said, `We'll
walk you over there if you want.'''
   Agent Eddie Appleby took the judge's seat. Ogden and Cpl. Chuck
De Los Santos stod by Chestnut, who said one of them volunteered
to be his lawyer.
   ``They said, `Ain't you guilty to your charge?' I said, `No man,
you crazy. Take me to 33rd Street,''' which is the county jail,
Chestnut said. ``I knew it wasn't real. I been to prison before.''
   The agents then took Chestnut back to a holding cell.
   De Los Santos described the incident as ``a spontaneous thing,
agents clowning around to break the tension.''
   He said he believed they had ``a joking relationship'' with the
defendant. ``I'm not trying to make light of it, but as quickly as
it started, it was stopped. It lasted under 45 seconds,'' De Los
Santos said.
   The state offered to reduce the charge from selling cocaine to
possession of cocaine, a lesser felony. Assistant Public Defencer
Betsy Benson turned down the offer on Tuesday after learning that
the substance seized from Chestnut was not cocaine.

   A firefight near the high Andean city of Puno
left 10 Maoist rebels and three policemen dead, the Interior
Ministry said Wednesday.
   The ministry said an unknown number of Shining Path rebels were
wounded in the gunfight, which took place Tuesday outside Puno, an
Indian city on the altiplano near the Bolivian border 525 miles
southeast of Lima.
   At least 40 rebels were involved in the gun battle, the ministry
spokesman said.
   In other violence, Shining Path rebels on Wednesday shot and
killed a police sergeant in a poor neighborhood north of Lima,
police said. The sergeant was shot repeatedly in the head and neck,
they said.
   A grenade was found Wednesday in a bathroom in Lima's Palace of
Justice near where a Shining Path commander is on trial, police
said.
   A note on the grenade read, ``There is one of these for each of
the dogs on the special tribunal judging the prisoners of war.''
   The Shining Path commander, Osman Morote, is thought to be the
rebel group's third-ranking leader. His trial, in which he is
charged with terrorism, began last November.
   Almost 20,000 Peruvians have died in political violence since
the Shining Path took up arms 10 years ago in the country's
interior. The violence has since spread through most of Peru,
including this capital.

off with hundreds of officers in riot gear. The demonstrators beat
drums, rattled metal barricades and hurled bagels, melon slices and
lasagna noodles at the officers.
   The noodle-tossing was organized by ACT-Up - AIDS Coalition To
Unleash Power, which accuses Bush of ignoring a commission's
recommendations to speed federal approval of various new drugs,
including some for AIDS patients. The commission is headed by Dr.
Louis Lasagna, and was formed by Bush when he was vice president.
   ``He has not said one word about this report,'' said ACT-Up
spokesman Joel Thomas.
   The significance of the other foodstuffs the demonstrators
hurled wasn't evident.
   Police said the arrests were for failure to disperse and
unlawful assembly, both misdemeanors. Officers began arrests when
the protesters failed to clear the streets near the Fairmont Hotel,
where the president spoke on behalf of U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, the
Republican candidated for California governor.
   Officers said most of those arrested were in the AIDS protest
group, but the majority of demonstrators were objecting to the
deployment of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia following the Iraqi
invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
   ``I'm opposed to what this government is doing by sending our
troops to Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, saying all these
countries invited them in after we twisted their arms,'' said Hilda
Cowan, a member of the Peace and Freedom Party.
   One man carried a sign reading, ``U.S. Farmers Say No War.''
   ``It's taking more money and manpower from creating the type of
world and environment we need,'' said Michael O'Gorman, a vegetable
grower from Salinas.
   At least one passer-by disagreed.
   ``I just don't agree with what they're doing,'' said Bob Murphy,
a tourist from Narberth, Penn. ``If we don't stop (Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein) now, he'll just go into Saudi Arabia and start
taking country by country.''

   Israelis flocked to synagogues Wednesday for
Rosh Hashana, the start of the Jewish year 5751, expected to be
dominated by the thousands of Soviet immigrants arriving in the
Jewish state.
   The new year holiday, traditionally welcomed in with the blowing
of the ram's horn known as the shofar, begins 10 days of
introspection. The period culminates with Yom Kippur, the Day of
Atonement.
   Many of Israel's 7,000 synagogues opened their doors free to
immigrants, following a request by Minister of Religious Affairs
Avner Shaki to waive the fees that some synagogues charge to raise
funds for religious work.
   Israel's state television on Wednesday marked the holiday with a
special broadcast accompanied by a Russian translation.
   While many Soviet immigrants will be hearing a shofar for the
first time, Soviet-born Yuri Stern noted that most new arrivals are
non-observant Jews and probably will not go to synagogue.
   Stern, a government adviser on Soviet Jewry, said many
immigrants were ``culturally sterile'' from the Soviet Union's
discouragement of Judaism, and would have to learn to identify with
the Jewish people.
   ``This is the people they basically belonged to but never had
any idea about,'' Stern said. ``They did not have any chance to
know what the whole thing is about since several decades have
elapsed since Judaism had been practiced.''
   According to figures released Wednesday by the Central Bureau of
Statistics, Israel's Jewish population grew by 3.9 percent the past
year, swelled by 115,000 new immigrants - 88 percent from the
Soviet Union.
   Israel's Moslem and Christian Arabs - 18.3 percent of
inhabitants - grew by 3.1 percent, bringing the total population to
4,705,000.
   During the holiday, 2,000 more Soviet immigrants are expected to
arrive, the Hatzofeh daily said.
   Officials have said up to 2 million Soviet immigrants could come
to Israel by the end of 1995, requiring an estimated $30 billion to
absorb them.
   The huge influx has raised questions about what the immigrants
will mean to Israel, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was asked by
the daily Hadashot if Israel could absorb so many people.
   ``I am not sure that we are able,'' he said. But he added: ``We
will make an effort and try. If we don't do it 100 percent, then we
will do it 80 percent or 70 percent.''
   A growing housing shortage and unemployment problems caused by
the immigration also were discussed in broadcasts and messages for
the new year.
   President Chaim Herzog said in a radio address that tenions must
be avoided between the new immigrants and young people, many forced
from their homes by the spiraling rents resulting from subsidies
the government gives newcomers.

<HEAD>79 New York Post Employees Take Buyout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   NEW YORK - Seveny-nine New York Post workers decided to resign
and take a buyout offered as part of a labor settlement to save the
tabloid, union and newspaper officials said Wednesday.
   The paper had sought only 43 resignations from the 350-member
Newspaper Guild as part of $19 million in union concessions owner
Peter S. Kalikow said he needed to make the paper profitable. The
505,000-circulation paper has been losing $27 million a year.
   The Guild resignations mean the Post will lose close to 200 of
its 960 workers. Agreements reached last week call for 100 forced
resignations from the 263-member drivers union and five from the
Post's 17 paper handlers.
   Guild members resigning include employees from editorial,
advertising, circulation, and accounting. Post Editor Jerry Nachman
said about 40 of the 79 resignations were from the editorial
department.
   ``It's not a number I like, or I'm happy with,'' said Nachman.
   Members of the union had until 5 p.m. Wednesday to resign and
collect full severance plus eight weeks shut down pay.
   Kalikow had improved the buyout offer before guild members voted
Monday on concessions slashing their pay 20 percent as part of a
four-day work week.
   The Guild had been the holdout among 11 unions that gave job and
wage cuts sought by Kalikow. Kalikow had said he would shut down
the 189-year-old paper if any one union refused the grant
concessions.
   Kalikow said Tuesday that the concessions from unions and cuts
in overhead and among the managerial staff will allow the paper to
be profitable by Oct. 1. That would be the first profit since the
1970s.
   Among the 79 staffers to resign was sports columnist Peter
Vecsey, who had previously told the newspaper he was leaving when
his contract expired in November. He will write a twice-weekly
sports column for USA Today. He also recently signed to be a
reporter on NBC's NBA pre-game show, ``The Insiders.''
   Peter Faris, Post vice president for editorial and
administration, said Vecsey's resignation was ``divorced from the
buyout scenario although as a Guild member he is availing himself
of the opportunity.''

   Baghdad on Wednesday began confiscating all foreign assets from
countries imposing sanctions on Iraq, but it allowed another
planeload of hundreds of American women and children to fly to
freedom.
   International support grew for a proposed air embargo against
Iraq. So did worries about the economic fallout from the Persian
Gulf conflict.
   ``Regrettably, events in the Middle East have introduced new and
substantial risks to the outlook,'' Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said in testimony before the congressional Joint Economic
Committee.
   ``Just the enormous uncertainty about how and when the tensions
in the Persian Gulf will be resolved undoubtedly is affecting the
economy in a negative way,'' Greenspan said in his first comments
on the U.S. economy since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The House approved a nearly $1 billion package to assist the
U.S. military buildup in the gulf. Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger, however, told Congress on Wednesday that
Washington will increasingly ask allies for money to meet foreign
policy needs rather than further strain the federal budget.
   U.S. fundraising efforts have so far yielded pledges of $20
billion from Persian Gulf states, Japan, Germany and the European
Community.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney asked Congress to let the Pentagon
accept and spend the allied contributions for military operations
in the gulf without prior approval from Capitol Hill.
   But Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., called the administration request an attempt to set up
``in effect, a military spending slush fund.''
   Still, the economic news wasn't all bad: oil prices dropped
about $1 a barrel after futures traders discovered the United
States has a bigger supply of gasoline than they thought.
   In other developments Wednesday:
   -The chairman of the KGB offered to give the CIA intelligence
about Iraq, where the Soviet government still has 5,000
specialists.
   -An Army paratrooper suffered a superficial leg wound when
struck by shrapnel from a misguided artillery shell in live-fire
exercises by U.S. forces in the Saudi desert. He was treated at the
scene.
   -Jordan's King Hussein flew to Rabat, Morocco, for a summit with
Moroccan and Algerian leaders aimed at solving the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   -Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati indicated Tehran
would open talks with Saudi Arabia, its greatest rival in the
Moslem world, to seek a solution to the gulf crisis.
   -Japanese automakers agreed to allow the United States to use
three auto transport ships to carry vehicles and other goods to the
Middle East.
   -The Army ordered 62 reserve units in 27 states to report for
active duty, and alerted 24 other units to prepare for possible
call-up. The Navy said it was activating 3 reserve units.
   -The flow of Kuwaitis into Saudi Arabia slowed, four days after
Iraq began allowing citizens to flee. Only about 30 cars passed
through the Khafji border crossing.
   Hundreds of American citizens were allowed to flee the Iraqi
capital aboard a U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways plane. The Boeing 747
carried 416 women and children, most of them Americans, on a flight
to London.
   Most of the passengers boarded the plane earlier in the day in
Kuwait, where another charter flight was scheduled Saturday.
   So far, about 1,500 Americans have been allowed to leave Iraq
and Kuwait on seven chartererd flights, but 1,000 more remain
behind. Iraqi soldiers have captured at least 90 American men - as
well as other Westerners - and are holding them hostage at unknown
locations.
   Many Westerners are reported to be hiding in Kuwait, and Iraq
has threatened to execute anyone sheltering them.
   Iraq on Wednesday began seizing the assets of all countries
participating in economic sanctions against it. The seizure order
also applied to all companies based in countries enforcing the
sanctions.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said the ruling Revolutionary
Command Council ordered the seizure Tuesday night under a law
dealing with the protection of ``Iraqi interests, money and rights
in Iraq and abroad.''
   ``All assets - cash deposits, property, interest and other
revenue - belonging to the governments, institutions, companies and
banks of the countries that have joined oppressive resolutions
against Iraq are hereby confiscated,'' said the new law, the text
of which was carried by INA.
   The statement did not provide estimates for foreign assets in
Iraq, or say how much cash was involved. The State Department was
unable to say how much the American assets seized by Iraq were
worth and a spokeswoman condemned the move.
   ``Actions like this can only make it more difficult for Iraq to
return to the international community of nations and to restore
economic relations which are crucial for Iraq's long-term
development,'' spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. ``The clear way
for Iraq to protect its interests is to comply with the Security
Council resolutions relating to its invasion of Kuwait.''
   The Iraqi News Agency text made no mention of Kuwait, but
earlier council decisions have stated Iraqi law applies to the
emirate, which Baghdad annexed six days after the invasion.
   The United States and Britain froze Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets
immediately after the invasion. Other countries, including all
European Community nations, quickly followed suit.
   In addition, the U.N. Security Council has imposed an embargo on
trade with Iraq, choking off its oil exports and blocking the
import of goods. The United States is leading a naval blockade to
enforce the embargo.
   President Bush, speaking on the campaign trail in California,
reiterated, ``We are ... prepared to take additional steps if
sanctions and the quest for a political resolution do not work.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Wednesday the five
permanent members of the Security Council - the United States,
Soviet Union, Britain, France and China - have agreed to extend the
embargo to air traffic.
   Under the resolution, all countries would have to close their
airspace to planes approaching or leaving Iraq or occupied Kuwait.
Planes could not be shot down under the proposed resolution, but
they could be challenged.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov has said he
expected the Security Council to approve the embargo this week.
   ``We want to toughen up the existing sanctions resolution,'' one
Western diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity, ``and
make sure it includes aircraft.''

   A judge gave a woman custody of four frozen
embryos fertilized by a donor after her ex-husband objected, saying
if the embryos became children he didn't want to support them.
   The custody issue was part of a divorce judgment entered Friday
by Circuit Judge George Lowrey in the case of Jerome and Wanda
Jenkins of Jay, a farming town near the Florida-Alabama line.
   Lowrey upheld the validity of an agreement the couple had signed
with the Fertility Institute of Northwest Florida that gives Mrs.
Jenkins first claim to custody of the embryos.
   Eggs were removed from her body and fertilized at the Gulf
Breeze clinic last November.
   ``The ruling was what we wanted,'' said J. Paul Fitzgerald, an
attorney representing Mrs. Jenkins.
   Lowrey, however, declined to rule on whether Jenkins must pay
child support if his ex-wife gives birth from the embryos. Mrs.
Jenkins asked for such an order but the judge said he could decide
that issue only after a birth takes place.
   Jenkins had objected to giving his former wife custody to
prevent the possibility of being ordered to support a child
fathered by another man, the donor. He wanted the clinic, where the
embryos are stored, to retain them and decide how they should be
used.
   His lawyer, Allen Lindsay, said no decision has yet been made on
whether to appeal the ruling. An appeal would have to be filed
within 30 days of Lowrey's ruling.
   Lindsay also said Lowrey's decision is in conflict with an
appeal court's ruling in a Tennessee divorce case. The Tennessee
Court of Appeals on Thursday overturned a judge's decision to grant
custody of seven frozen embryos to Mary Sue Davis Stowe.
   The three-judge panel gave the woman, now living in Titusville,
and her former husband, Junior Lewis Davis of Maryville, Tenn.,
joint custody, meaning both must agree before the embryos can be
used.
   That case, however, differed from the Jenkins case because Davis
and Mrs. Stowe, both since remarried, had not signed a custody
agreement beforehand, Fitzgerald said.
   The Jenkinses were married in 1971 and have no children.

   A religious cult leader trying to avoid
the death penalty in the electric chair for killing a family of
five said Wednesday he is a prophet who did only as God commanded
him.
   Jeffrey Lundgren, 40, was convicted last month on five counts of
aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping in the deaths of
Dennis Avery; his wife, Cheryl, and their three daughters last
year.
   In an unsworn statement during his sentencing hearing, he told
the jury that convicted him, and is considering his sentence, that
God told him to kill the Averys.
   ``It's not a figment of my imagination that I can in fact talk
to God, that I can hear his voice. ... In fact, all the prophets
were commanded to specific acts,'' he said.
   In Ohio, defendants in capital crimes involving a possible death
penalty have the option of giving unsworn statements.
   Prosecutors said the murders may have been considered a ritual
to help other cult members find God during wilderness treks
afterward.
   The victims' bodies were found on a farm Lundgren rented at
Kirtland, 30 miles east of Cleveland. All five were shot with a
pistol and they were buried in a common grave under a barn.
   Lundgren didn't testify during his trial. His attorneys admitted
he fired the shots.
   Lundgren, whose wife and son also were convicted, was a lay
minister of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day
Saints in Kirtland until he was defrocked in 1988 for inappropriate
conduct. He later formed his own sect at the farm.
   Lundgren said he began questioning doctrines of the Reorganized
Church, an early offshot of the Mormon church, saying he believed
there could be more than one prophet.
   Doctrinal issues ``became more and more a problem with me,'' he
said.
   ``Never did I have a profound experience in worship services in
church,'' he said.
   Standing at the defense table, Lundgren took nearly five hours
to make his statement. He spoke in calm, measured tones, frequently
referring to his Bible.
   His cult, he said, was preparing for the second coming of
Christ, which it believed would occur at the Reorganized Church's
temple in Kirtland. But, first, the spiritually unclean had to be
dealt with, he said.
   Dennis Avery tried to lead people to false gods, Lundgren said.
``I abhorred he sin that was in Mr. Avery,'' he said.
   Lundgren said messages he gleaned from the Bible told him to
kill the Avery family. Passages in the books of Isaiah and Matthew,
and in the Doctrine of Covenants of the Mormon church, told him to
dig a pit, bind the Averys, kill them and then bury the bodies
along with stones, he said.
   ``There are no plea bargains at the great day of judgment,'' he
said. ``It is real simple. You obey or you perish. The word said to
me that this act had to be done, and it was obeyed.''
   Other than the death penalty, Lundgren could face life in prison
without parole for 20 years or life without parole for 30 years.
   On Tuesday, his son, Damon Lundgren, 19, was convicted on eight
of 10 counts in the Avery deaths and faces a sentencing hearing
Monday. He was acquitted of a single count each of aggravated
murder and kidnapping in the death of Cheryl Avery.
   He also could face the electric chair.
   Last month, Alice Lundgren, 39, was sentenced to five
consecutive life terms for conspiracy, complicity and kidnapping.
   The Lundgrens were among 13 cult members arrested in the case.
Most of the members lived at the Kirtland farm. Some have pleaded
guilty to reduced charges.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Denny Smith was accused Wednesday
in an ethics complaint of using his office for personal gain in
transactions involving savings and loan associations.
   The complaint against the Oregon Republican alleging violations
of House ethics rules was filed by the House Democratic Campaign
Committee.
   It also accuses Smith of breaking House rules by using his
congressional office and equipment on his re-election campaign. The
filing went to the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct
in Washington.
   Smith said the charges amount to ``dirty politics'' by his
Democratic challenger, Mike Kopetski.
   ``He is a politician behind in the polls and will now do
anything to get back in this race, including using dirty political
tricks to confuse the voters,'' Smith said.
   Kopetski said he hoped the committee will investigate the
charges ``and make a judgment prior to the election.''
   The complaint says that according to news accounts, Smith
``fervently lobbied the Federal Home Loan Bank Board for a
softening of its policies against directors of failed savings and
loan institutions who had been responsible for their institutions'
bankruptcy.'' Smith was a director of a failing thrift, American
Federal Savings &amp; Loan of Salem.
   Smith also is accused of seeking special treatment for Jimmie
Taylor, a defendant in a civil lawsuit against former directors and
officers of State Federal Savings &amp; Loan of Corvallis and a major
contributor to Smith's campaign.
   The complaint also alleges federal savings and loan regulations
appear to have been violated by a $229,500 home mortgage loan to
Smith by American Federal Savings &amp; Loan while he was a director of
the thrift.
   The institution waived a standard $5,000 loan fee to Smith
without making a required prior disclosure to federal regulators,
according to the complaint.
   The complaint also says ethical questions arise involving
financing that Smith obtained from Citizens Savings &amp; Loan for an
industrial park partnership in Salem in which he was a co-owner.
   The thrift lost $1.4 million on the loan and eventually
collapsed in 1987.
   The complaint also charges that Smith violated House rules by
listing his congressional telephone number on campaign literature
and using material produced by his congressional staff in a
campaign mailing.
   The campaign committee chairman, Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark.,
said during an Oregon visit last month that his committee probably
wouldn't file a complaint because it would seem to be political
opportunism.
   Anthony never ruled out that allegations might be filed, Anthony
aide Howard Schloss said Wednesday from Washington.

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordan will lose more than $2 billion this
year because of the Persian Gulf crisis and faces economic ruin
without massive foreign aid, the finance minister said Wednesday.
   ``Unless Jordan receives substantial support from the
international community, the economy of Jordan will start to face
very serious difficulties in October or November,'' said Finance
Minister Bassel Jardaneh.
   In Cairo, meanwhile, Kamal al-Ganzouri, the government planning
minister was quoted as saying Wednesday that Egypt's losses will
amount to $2.73 billion.
   Jardaneh said Jordan told the U.N. Security Council that Amman
will continue to receive oil from Iraq until it can make financial
arrangements to buy oil elsewhere.
   ``I think Jordan has a strong and clear justification for doing
this,'' said Jardaneh, who denied Jordan was breaking the U.N.
sanctions leveled on Iraq after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``You are creating a complete economic dislocation of resources
in Jordan and the economic repercussions of this are substantial,''
Jardaneh said.
   Jordan, with an annual budget of $3.7 billion, imports about 22
million barrels of oil a year - about 90 percent from Iraq and
Kuwait.
   Under the terms of the contract, Iraq has guaranteed the price
of oil will not exceed $16.40 a barrel. The current world market
price is about $32 a barrel.
   Before the gulf crisis, Jordan relied on Iraq and Kuwait to buy
about one-third of its total exports. That income was cut off by
the U.N. sanctions, which have brought Jordan's already troubled
economy to its knees.
   ``The effect is colossal,'' said Ali Attiqa, resident U.N.
coordinator in Jordan. ``Jordan will need massive aid.''
   Jardaneh said losses from exports to Iraq and Kuwait are
expected to reach $280 million this year. He said the country will
also lose $185 million in grants pledged by Iraq and Kuwait, $250
million from port services, $230 million in tourism revenue and
$320 million in remittances from Jordanians working abroad.
   In addition, the crisis will cost Jordan $160 million in exports
to other countries and Amman may have to pay $169 million toward
loans it guaranteed for Iraq during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war,
Jardaneh said.
   Information Minister Ibrahim Izzeddine said Wednesday that if
the international community wants Jordan to observe the economic
sanctions against Iraq, it must contribute substantial foreign aid.
   Jardaneh said that without such aid, not only might the economy
collapse, but Jordan will not be able to meet payments on its $8.4
billion foreign debt.
   So far, only Japan, West Germany and the European Community have
pledged aid to Jordan, Jardaneh said.

   The International Press Institute said Wednesday
it was concerned about the arrest of an editor in Turkey and the
detention of journalists in Egypt and Syria.
   It also said it was concerned about harassment of foreign
journalists by Serbian police in Yugoslavia and about what it said
were plans in Romania for new press curbs.
   Peter Galliner, director of the institute, sent protest letters
to the presidents of Turkey and Syria and Egypt's Interior
Minister.
   The message to Turkish President Turgut Ozal called for the
release of Dogu Perincek, editor of the newspaper Yozol, who was
arrested last month in Diyarbakir in eastern Turkey and is awaiting
trial.
   Galliner said Perincek was jailed after speaking out against
``current government repression in the southeastern region of
Turkey.''
   The institute's message to Gen. Abdul Halim Mussa, the Egyptian
minister of the interior, called for the release of Khaled Sherif,
a journalist with the newspaper El Hakika. The institute said it
had reports Sherif had been tortured in Tora Reception prison.
   Galliner's message to Syrian President Hafez Assad said the
detention of journalist Imad Naddaf was a ``gross violation of
human rights'' and that he should either be released or charged.
   ``We understand that Naddaf was arrested in 1982 under the state
of emergency law,'' Galliner said. ``He has not been charged
officially or sentenced, is still held in detention and is not
allowed legal access or visits by his family.''
   Galliner also sent protest letters to the president of the
Yugoslavian republic of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, and to Romanian
President Ion Iliescu.
   He said Serbian police had harassed foreign journalists
reporting recent unrest in the southern province of Kosovo, which
Serbia formally administers.
   There has been continued unrest in the province the past 18
months as the majority Albanian community in Kosovo protests
Serbia's dominance of the province.
   Galliner urged Iliescu to withdraw a draft law on the press.
   If passed, he said, the measure would ``seriously threaten''
press freedom in Romania and ``undermine the right to full and free
reporting, discussion and public debate.''
   He said the proposed law would forbid the publication of ``false
or alarming information or comments that might seriously threaten
or disturb public law and order.'' Galliner said it should be
replaced with a proposal that would affirm ``the right of the
Romanian people to freedom of speech and of the press.''
   The institute has offices in London and Zurich, Switzerland, and
is an independent organization of publishers and editors in 60
countries.

   The government has charged two people it accuses
of trying to sell $500 million worth of weapons, planes and other
military hardware left behind in Vietnam to undercover agents
posing as arms dealers.
   The supplies included fighter planes, helicopters, tanks, bomb,
canons, and guns, the Customs Service said in announcing the case
Wednesday.
   Samuel Pilsu Pyun, 68, and Dep Huynh George, 42, were charged
with conspiracy to violate the Trading with the Enemy Act after
they were arrested Monday, said Customs Service Special Agent
George W. Kelley.
   When asked if Pyun and Ms. George were working for the
Vietnamese government, Kelley would only say the two had told the
undercover agents in Hawaii that they could acquire arms from
Vietnam.
   Kelley refused to reveal further details of the case.
   Pyun, an import-export businessman and real estate broker from
the island of Maui, was released Monday on a $50,000 signature
bond. Ms. George, a naturalized citizen from Vietnam who lives in
Honolulu, remained in custody Wednesday, unable to post $50,000
bail.

   A freighter carrying 200 military
trucks to the Middle East broke down about 350 miles off Florida
and had to be towed to Jacksonville for unloading and repairs.
   The 11,367-ton Gulf Banker, part of the U.S. Ready Reserve
Fleet, was at Blount Island Wednesday, about 8,100 miles short of
its destination in Saudi Arabia.
   Last week, while 350 miles off the coast of Jacksonville, one of
the 27-year-old ship's twin boilers ruptured. The Gulf Banker was
towed to Jacksonville last weekend, said Lt. Cmdr. Galen Dunton,
senior investigating officer for the U.S. Coast Guard in
Jacksonville.
   The ship's problems began shortly after it pulled away from dock
in Beaumont, Texas, on Aug. 29.
   The ship was at sea 10 hours when the boilers quit, forcing the
crew into Port Arthur, Texas, for repairs.
   Two days later, the ship suffered additional boiler troubles, a
clogged sewage system and a broken-down air-conditioning system. It
hobbled into Port Everglades on Sept. 4, where it underwent five
days of repairs.
   On Sept. 11, two days after leaving port, the starboard boiler
ruptured and the ship was towed to Jacksonville.

<HEAD>Yugoslav States Will be Allowed to Secede</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's mosaic of nationalities
and republics will soon be allowed to choose whether to remain a
single country or split into different states, the federal
leadership said Wednesday.
   Yugoslavia may be radically reshaped even if its six member
republics decide to remain within the country, said a statement by
the collective presidency carried by the state Tanjug news agency.
   The governments of two republics - Croatia and Slovenia - insist
that the country of 23 million people, who belong to numerous
ethnic groups and religions, should become a loose confederation of
near-independent states, the statement said.
   Such a confederation would cooperate only if joint interests
warrant it, the presidency said.
   Communist-ruled Serbia, the largest republic, insists a
confederative structure would be too unstable, and advocates
retaining the federal system installed in 1945, said the statement.
   It added that the three remaining states - Bosnia-Hercegovina,
Macedonia and Montenegro - also prefer a federation.
   Borisav Jovic, the Serb now leading the presidency, said in a
recent interview that a nationwide referendum may be held soon to
determine the future makeup of the country.
   The statement said a consensus has been reached among the
republics that ``anyone who would not agree with the future
constitutional system of Yugoslavia, would be allowed to secede.''
   The statement indicated that if the states favoring a looser
union could not reach agreement with the rest of the country, they
would be permitted to enter into a confederation with the other
republics that would stay in the current federal structure.
   Yugoslavia in recent years has been faced with growing
differences among the republics and rising nationalism that many
fear could escalate into civil war.
   In the first free Yugoslav elections in 50 years, center-right
parties won the most votes in Slovenia and Croatia.

   The Interior Ministry on Wednesday
canceled all entry, residence and work privileges extended to
unspecified foreign nationals. Diplomats said they believed the
announcement was directed at Yemenis.
   The announcement said entry visas would no longer be available
at entry points to foreign nationals who used to enjoy that right,
and that foreigners would have to apply for entry visas at
embassies.
   The announcement revoked any exemptions from the kingdom's
strict residence rules and specified that all foreigners would
henceforth be barred from freely practicing any trade.
   A three-month period was prescribed ``to correct the
situation.''
   The kingdom, which has an expatriate community of more than 3
million, had been particularly open to citizens from neighboring
Yemen. More than 1 million Yemenis form the largest part of the
kingdom's expatriate labor force.
   Yemenis have been allowed relatively free entry into the kingdom
and also conducted trade without needing the Saudi sponsor required
of other foreign nationals.
   Yemen has been the scene of virulent anti-Saudi demonstrations
since the kingdom invited the United States and other Western
nations to send troops to help deter any Iraqi attack on the
kingdom.
   The Yemeni government has said it does not condone Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait but has also demanded a negotiated settlement of
the conflict and said the presence of foreign forces complicates
the crisis.

   Former President Reagan on Wednesday discussed

   Cossiga's spokesman, Ludovico Ortona, said Reagan received a
``very friendly, very warm'' greeting from Cossiga.
   ``It was a very useful and important occasion for both to
exchange views and ideas on the changes in Europe, the changes in
the Soviet Union,'' Ortona said.
   Reagan is at the end of a trip that included several days in the
Soviet Union.
   Ortona said Reagan had been ``very impressed by the greater
liberty that he found in the (Soviet Union), and the growing
commitment to a free market.''
   Cossiga and Reagan met for 20 minutes, then had lunch with
Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti. Also present at the luncheon were
Nancy Reagan and Andreotti's wife, Livia.
   The Reagans were scheduled to meet Pope John Paul II on Thursday
before returning to the United States. They have also been in
Poland and East and West Germany on their tour.

   Anthony S. Cristillo started his entertainment career under the

   He played saxophone for band leader Paul Whiteman, then returned
to his hometown of Paterson, N.J., with his own 10-piece band, Pat

<TEXT>
   What do you do when an elephant gets
stuck?
   Call a tow truck. In fact, call two tow trucks.
   That's what officials at the Washington Park Zoo did Wednesday
when Tamba, a 7,000-pound pachyderm, was trapped for more than
three hours in the dry moat that surrounds the zoo's elephant
compound.
   ``The elephants were horsing around in the back yard,'' zoo
spokeswoman Jane Hartline said. ``Evidently she got pushed in.''
   The moat is about 8 feet deep and is designed to allow elephants
who slip into it to walk to a gate at the end of it. But
19-year-old Tamba has an arthritic leg and couldn't move.
Zookeepers didn't see the mishap but responded to the elephant's
squeals and called for two tow trucks.
   Officials attached air bags to Tamba's midsection, then
connected them to cables that were hoisted by two tow trucks. As
the cables were lifted, more air was pumped into the bags.
   After considerable effort, Tamba was pulled to her feet and she
walked, slowly at first, then quickly, to the elephant house,
squealing as she moved. She was a little stiff but otherwise
unhurt.
   ``It's funny, because while they were doing it, she was very
quiet,'' Hartline said. ``But after she got out, she was talking
quite a bit. She was very happy to get out.'

<HEAD>Rival Factions Agree to Truce, Suspected Collaborator Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two rival Palestinian factions, the PLO's Fatah
and the Moslem fundamentalist Hamas movement, announced Wednesday
they have ended their fud and will coordinate efforts in fighting
the Israelis.
   The agreement, announced in a leaflet circulated in Jerusalem,
came 10 days after supporters of the two factions clashed on the
streets of the Tulkarem refugee camp. At least 20 people were
injured in the battles.
   The fighting at Tulkarem began when supporters of Fatah, the
mainstream group of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
reportedly blocked a Hamas preacher from speaking at a local
mosque.
   The truce marked at least the third time the rival factions have
tried to end their dispute since the Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation began in December 1987 in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Also Wednesday, five masked Palestinians entered the home of an
Arab woman, Tuhfa Abu Denain, 43, in Tulkarem and stabbed her to
death, Arab reports said. They said the woman was a suspected
informer for Israeli authorities.
   The military spokesman's office said it had no information on
the incident.
   Ms. Denain's death raised to at least 260 the number of
Palestinians killed by fellow Arabs in the 34-month-old uprising.
Most were suspected of collaboration with Israel.
   A total of 730 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians, and 47 Israelis have also died in the uprising.
   Arab reports said another Palestinian, Mujahed Hussein Sadaa
from the village of Jeib north of Jerusalem, was reported killed
Wednesday in Israel's Megiddo Prison.
   An army spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the death and said Sadaa was killed by a fellow prisoner.
She did not know the motive.
   The leaflet distributed by the Fatah and Hamas factions called
on supporters to end their rivalry and improve relations.
   ``We announce an official decision to all our strike forces to
stop fighting, to organize uprising activities together and to
coordinate efforts in confronting the enemy and its forces,'' the
leaflet said. ``We believe that national unity is the way to
victory.''
   Meanwhile, two Israeli teen-agers who sneaked across Israel's
closed border with Jordan last month were charged Wednesday with an
illegal crossing, Israel radio said. If convicted, the youths face
up to four years in prison.
   The two, Hananel Shear-Yashuv and Lior Mizrahi, both 17, were
returned to Israel by Jordanian authorities on Sept. 6. The two
countries are technically at war.
   Dozens of young Israelis have tried to dash across the border to
Petra since the 1950s, viewing the trip as a test of courage. Petra
is 18 miles from the border.

   A Dallas County commissioner made no apology
Wednesday for remarks suggesting that violence would erupt if the
city hires a ``good old boy'' police chief who is insensitive to
minorities.
   Commissioner John Wiley Price, however, said he may have been
irresponsible in making the statements to a newspaper.
   ``I should probably not have said some of the things I did,'' he
said.
   He made the remarks in an interview published Wednesday in The
Dallas Morning News. Later, he softened his remarks and told the
newspaper he would advocate violence only in the event of police
violence against civilians.
   ``If you try to bring in a good old boy in this system, we're
going to be in the streets. Physically, literally, shooting folks.
We're not going to tolerate it,'' Price said in Wednesday's
article.
   City Manager Jan Hart is seeking a replacement to police Chief
Mack Vines, who was fired Sept. 12 after his indictment on a
misdemeanor perjury count.
   The dismissal of Vines, who is white, angered some in the city's
minority community. Price, who is black, warned against replacing
Vines with someone lacking the former chief's sensitivity to
minority concerns.
   ``I think we ought to be armed and be prepared ... for whatever
comes,'' Price told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ``We're
going to protect our own and we're going to protect ourselves. And
if that means from the police and everybody else, we're going to do
that.''
   Price added: ``And I think at some point in time we're going to
have to be more aggressive than we are defensive. That could mean
anything. By any means necessary. That's what Malcolm X said.''
   At a press conference Wednesday, Price was accompanied by three
other black leaders in what he called a clarification of his
earlier remarks.
   ``The call to arms is not an offensive move,'' he said. ``It is
meant in defense. We will try to defend our community. We have
historically had to do that, and we must defend our community at
all costs.''
   Pice's comments brought a strong protest from Dallas County
Judge Lee Jackson, who apologized on behalf of the county
commissioners' court.
   ``All four of the other members of the other members of the
Commissioners' Court condemn those comments predicting and even
appearing to condone violence,'' he said. ``We apologize to the
rank and file police officers in Dallas and their families.''

<HEAD>Attorney Files Class Action Suit Against Williams' Bank</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An attorney filed a class-action suit Wednesday
on behalf of four Houston car buyers who claim a bank controlled by
Republican gubernatorial candidate Clayton Williams forced them to
purchase unnecessary insurance as a condition for a loan.
   David Bragg of Austin, Texas, said the lawsuit eventually could
involve 400 to 1,000 claimants who say the bank made them buy
disability and life insurance before it issued loans.
   The lawsuit was filed in Travis County's state district court
against Claydesta National Bank of Midland.
   ``The basics of the lawsuit are that the plaintiff contends that
Claydesta and three other entities required them to purchase credit
disability insurance and life insurance and that the insurance had
to be purchased from a certain company in order to secure a car
loan,'' Bragg said.
   Williams and bank president David N. Jones repeatedly have
denied the bank made such requirements for its loans. Both have
said they will cooperate with any investigations of the loans.
   Bragg said attorneys are investigating claims from Claydesta
National borrowers in Houston, Fort Worth and Dallas. He said
besides the insurance costs that allegedly inflated the loan price,
borrowers also had to pay ``an undisclosed broker's fee that was
not figured into the cost of the loan.''
   The lawsuit follows Tuesday's announcement that two state
agencies have begun investigating Claydesta National's loan
practices.
   Rich Tomlinson, in charge of the Texas Attorney General's
consumer protection division in Houston, said he had ``not reached
any conclusions, but that could well be a violation of the state's
deceptive trade practices act.''
   Besides the Texas Attorney General's office, the state Consumer
Credit Commission also is investigating the allegations.

   Authorities in a southern Chinese city executed
65 criminals, including murderers, rapists, smugglers and
``hooligans'' in one of China's largest mass executions, an
official report said.
   The executions on Tuesday in Guangzhou, or Canton, comprised the
largest such occurrence since a nationwide campaign against crime
began in China a year ago. They followed the executions of nine
people in Shanghai for murder, theft and pimping last week.
   According to a report in Tuesday's editions of the Yancheng
Evening News, published in Guangzhou, 65 ``criminals'' were
executed in 12 areas of the city. The crimes included murder, rape,
gun smuggling, hooliganism and ``major crimes,'' which often means
theft, extortion or burglary.
   Among the executed was a woman, the report said.
   Executions in China usually occur with a bullet to the back of
the head.
   Last week, Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, said more than 500 people have been executed in China
the past year in the anti-crime campaign. At least another 600
people have been sentenced to death, it said.
   Amnesty said the latest round of executions was the most severe
nationwide crackdown since 1983. The anti-crime campaign has
occurred in the wake of China's violent suppression of nationwide
pro-democracy protests last June.
   Amnesty said that amog those executed were people accused of
engaging in religious activities deemed counterrevolutionary or
those who committed acts of violence during the 1989 protests for
freedom.
   China last Thursday denounced the Amnesty report.
   ``On the question of human rights, there are always differing
interpretations,'' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said in
Beijing.
   Despite the controversy, China in some areas is facing a crime
wave.
   Beijing's decade of economic reform has produced serious social
dislocations and corruption, especially in Guangdong Province and
the province's capital, Guangzhou. Guangdong borders the wealthy
British colony of Hong Kong and is one of the engines of China's
modernization drive.
   Organized criminal gangs from Hong Kong, the Triads, have moved
into Guangdong and joined local criminals, pushing drugs,
prostitution, gambling, smuggling and other social vices, law
enforcement officials say. China's police appear incapable of
dealing with the crime boom and in some cases might contribute to
it.
   In May, for example, two Hong Kong undercover policemen were
abducted by Chinese security officials who sneaked into Hong Kong
waters to smuggle three luxury cars to the mainland. The policemen
were released only after China's official Xinhua News Agency
accused the Hong Kong government of fabricating the incident.
   Travelers to Guangdong Province report that heroin and
prostitutes are readily available. An American reporter who
recently returned from the area said heroin was for sale at
numerous locations for $34 a gram.

   The state on Wednesday took a cue from the
Wild West to fight pollution. It deputized all residents and
offered cash bounties for every polluter turned in.
   ``The fact is we all have responsibility for working actively to
preserve and protect our little piece of this planet,'' Gov. Jim
Florio said in unveiling the program and dubbing citizens
``enviro-cops.''
   Beginning immediately, any citizen with information on illegally
dumped waste - garbage, medical waste, toxic chemicals and
low-level radioactive waste - can report it to the county
prosecutor, county health department or the office of state
environmental prosecutor Steven Madonna.
   The tip must be delivered in person, Madonna said.
   If the tip leads to a civil or criminal fine, the whistleblower
will receive either 10 percent of the fine or $250, which ever is
greater.
   Polluters can be charged under the Solid Waste Management Act,
the Water Pollution Control Act and other statues governing the
storage and disposal of hazardous wastes and low-level radioactive
waste.
   If the information leads to the arrest and conviction of someone
dumping hazardous or radioactive waste, the tipster pockets half
the penalty.
   Environmental Commissioner Judith Yaskin estimated the state has
collected $10 million in pollution fines during the first six
months of the year.
   Rob Stuart, program director for the New Jersey Public Interest
Research Group, compared the effort to the popular television
program ``America's Most Wanted,'' which also calls on citizens to
capture criminals.
   ``Bounty hunting has worked for centuries to reward private
citizens,'' Stuart said. ``This is important stuff.''

   An Iraqi Airways jetliner with 110
Americans from Iraq and occupied Kuwait and 306 evacuees of other
nationalities arrived in Britain late Wednesday, an airport
official said.
   The plane, chartered by the U.S. government, landed shortly
before midnight at Gatwick airport, 25 miles south of the capital.
   The official said that in addition to the 110 Americans, the
Boeing 747 carried 37 Britons and five Canadians. He said the 264
other passengers were Jordanians, Egyptians, Palestinians,
Icelanders, Spaniards, Greeks, Kenyans and Indonesians.
   Late Wednesday in Washington, a State Department spokesman said
the 110 Americans were accompanied by about 200 foreign-born family
members.
   ``We have 300 Americans and foreign-born family. 110 are
actually Americans,'' the spokesman said.
   The plane had flown to Baghdad earlier Wednesday from Kuwait.
   Sky News television said it understood the plane would return to
Baghdad with Iraqis on board, and that they would include some of
those ordered to leave Britain.
   Britain on Monday ordered the expulsion of two military attaches
and six support staff from the Iraqi Embassy and 23 other Iraqis
living in Britain. The move came in retaliation for Iraqi
intrusions into several European embassies in Kuwait.
   The State Department said the Americans and their foreign-born
family members are scheduled to fly from Gatwick on a U.S.
government-chartered flight to Raleigh-Durham airport in North
Carolina sometime Thursday. No time for departure has been fixed.

   The United States wants continued
access to the military bases it will leave behind after completing
a gradual pullout from the Philippines, the spokesman for U.S.
negotiators said Wednesday.
   Stanley Schrager, spokesman for the U.S. panel, made the
statement on the second day of talks on the future of the six
U.S.-run military bases here. Their lease expires in September
1991.
   Communist rebels offered a nationwide cease-fire if President
Corazon Aquino rejects American proposals for continued use of the
bases.
   Meanwhile, the State Department late Wednesday in Washington
warned of ``a possible imminent terrorist bombing'' by the
Communist New People's Army against U.S. government or other public
facilities in Manila.
   In a brief statement attributed to spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler, the State Department said the danger was ``in the
vicinity of Roxas Boulevard in Manila.''
   Several hotels, the U.S. Embassy and the Central Bank, where the
bases talks were being held are on the boulevard, which runs from
near the Manila airport to the heart of the city.
   During talks Tuesday, the chief U.S. negotiator, Richard
Armitage, hinted that Washington would scale down its military
presence here but hoped to delay a final decision on the fate of
the bases until the next century.
   Schrager, discussing the period aftr the American soldiers are
gone, said of the military facilities: ``They will be Philippine
bases to which the U.S. would hope to have some access as it has
with other countries around the world.
   ``This is a far cry from what we have now, where we have a large
military presence in the autonomous kind of situation in our
particular facilities in the Philippine military bases.''
   The six bases in question, which include Clark Air Base and the
Subic Bay naval base, are among the oldest and largest American
military facilities outside the United States.
   Most surveys show a majority of Filipinos support them. But any
treaty to keep the bases here after the lease runs out requires
approval by two-thirds of the 23-member Senate, where opposition is
strong. The Philippine Congress could also require the extension to
be approved in a national referendum.
   Opponents, such as Communist rebels, believe that the bases
infringe on national sovereignty.
   In a statement to news agencies Wednesday, the rebel National
Democratic Front called for rejection of any U.S. proposal to
extend its use of the facilities. The group said it would
immediately declare a nationwide unilateral cease-fire if Mrs.
Aquino agreed to its demand.
   Mrs. Aquino has said the end of the Cold War and absence of an
external threat to the Philippines diminish the need for the bases.
She said Monday it was time to discuss the ``orderly withdrawal''
of U.S. forces.
   The United States has strongly supported the Aquino government.
It sent jets from Clark to fly air cover for government forces
during a bloody coup attempt last December.

   More than 30,000 students and staff were
evacuated from the University of California at Berkeley on
Wednesday because of a bomb threat by an anonymous caller.
   But the 5:26 p.m. threatened time for the blasts passed without
incident, said a university spokesman.
   ``Everything is still quiet,'' said Jesus Mena, public
information officer for Berkeley. ``Actually, the evacuation went
pretty smoothly.''
   The evacuation of 6,000 to 8,000 staff members and as many as
30,000 students began at 4 p.m. and ended at 7 p.m. after bomb
squads, the FBI and fire officials determined the campus was safe.
   A package that Police Chief Jennifer Harrison described as a
``potential hoax device'' was sent to the FBI lab in Washington for
analysis.
   A San Francisco television station, KRON, reported that a man
called the bomb threat to the station and to police before 11 a.m.
   According to the station's assignment editor, Glenn Adams, the
bomber claimed to be a member of a group called the ``United
Unification of Something.'' The caller said the group placed four
bombs on campus in order to protest weapons testing and the United
States' presence in the Middle East.
   Police didn't release details of the bomb threat.
   ``The threat was considered serious enough to empty all
buildings in the best interest of campus safety,'' the university
said in a statement.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI Director William Sessions has accepted the
recommendation of a court-appointed panel that he promote 11
Hispanic agents in the aftermath of a discrimination suit against
the bureau, a spokesman said Wednesday night.
   The panel of three outside lawyers was created last year after a
federal judge found in 1988 that the FBI systematically
discriminated against Hispanic agents in assignments and
promotions.
   In the class-action suit joined by 311 of the FBI's
approximately 400 Hispanic agents, U.S. District Judge Lucius
Bunton III of Midland, Texas, directed the bureau to end its
``unsystematic, excessively subjective'' method of promoting
special agents.
   Bunton said the ability of special agents in charge of field
offices to overrule promotion-board decisions was ``anathema to
nearly every reform advanced by the bureau and ordered by this
court to improve the fairness and reviewability'' of the process.
   Spokesman Mike Horton said Sessions could have appealed the
panel's selection of the agents for promotion but decided not to.
The New York Times first reported the decision.
   In earlier rulings, the judge found that Hispanic agents were
often relegated to what one Hispanic agent has described as the
``taco circuit'' - working in Hispanic neighborhoods or doing
language translations.
   Bunton concluded that Hispanic agents were often assigned to
such undesirable tasks as monitoring Spanish-speaking suspects on
wiretaps.
   After he took office in November 1987, Sessions reviewed all FBI
personnel and recruitment policies, saying he would tolerate no
discrimination.

   Jewish community leaders, concerned by a
rash of anti-Semitic acts, arranged police protection for all
services marking the Jewish New Year that began Wednesday.
   Police have reported 23 anti-Semitic incidents since July.
Graffiti has been daubed on synagogues and Jewish fraternities and
sororities, and individual Jews have reported being insulted on the
streets.
   The brake lines on a school bus parked behind the Temple Beth
Israel were cut in July by an unknown person, police said. The
driver of the bus, used to take children to a Jewish camp,
discovered the problem before driving off.
   Police were asked to provide at least one officer for protection
at services at B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation, Temple Beth Israel
and Temple Beth El during Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, said
Steven Morrison, director of the Madison Jewish Community Council.
   In addition, two off-duty officers were to be present during
services at two Madison synagogues, Morrison said.
   Police Capt. Mike Masterson said three uniformed officers
monitored the the services, and no problems were reported.
   ``It's sad and outrageous that at this time, in this country and
this city, coming down on the side of caution requires having
police present,'' Morrison said. Madison, ironically, has a
reputation as a place where people ``celebrate difference so
well,'' Morrison said.
   ``It's bothersome because you want to be able to feel you live
in America and don't need police guards to feel secure when you go
to services,'' said Irv Saposnik, director of a Jewish student
group at the University of Wisconsin.
   Rosh Hashanah began at sundown. It marks the start of the Jewish
faith's 10-day High Holidays that end with Yom Kippur, the day of
atonement, on Sept. 29.

   The Pentagon is ending operations or trimming
forces at 150 facilities overseas, but the commander of U.S. troops
in Europe says the cuts may not quickly translate into major cost
savings.
   ``Yes, there are some savings,'' said Gen. Bernard Galvin. ``But
I doubt they are going to be anything close to what everyone is
expecting.''
   The base closings and cutbacks, most of which will occur in
Europe, represent a reduction of up to 25 percent of the air
fields, barracks, training grounds and other facilities of Galvin's
command.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., chairwoman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on military installations and facilities,
said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's base closure list was a
disappointment.
   ``The Defense Department claims it will close 150 sites
overseas, but these sites include gas stations on the autobahn,
isolated housing units, athletic fields, and sites which had long
ago been slated for closure,'' she said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The pro-Iraqi media contends that American
soldiers sent to Saudi Arabia are afflicted with all the
manifestations of U.S. decadence, including AIDS, alcohol, drugs
and a yearning for prostitutes.
   The Iraqi people also are being told that Israel, far from being
a peripheral player in the Persian Gulf crisis, has sent planes,
tanks and soldiers to Saudi Arabia, all elaborately disguised as
being part of the American arsenal.
   A U.S. Information Agency analysis of the pro-Saddam Hussein
media in Iraq and elsewhere says there has been an ``extremely
active'' disinformation campaign waged against the United States
and U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   ``Although many Iraqi disinformation claims are crude and
patently false, past experience with disinformation campaigns
indicates that even the most outrageous claims can be widely
believed,'' the analysis said.

   BOSTON (AP) - John Silber, Boston University's blunt and caustic

   Silber, who was all but written off a week ago for referring to
an inner-city neighborhood as a ``group of drug addicts,'' will
face Republican William Weld, a former federal prosecutor, in
November.
   In Oklahoma, voters on Tuesday approved a first-in-the-nation
constitutional amendment limiting state lawmakers to 12 years in
office. In runoff elections for the gubernatorial nomination,
Democrat David Walters and Republican Bill Price slipped past their
opponents by as few as 3,046 votes.
   ``It is time to put limits on the professional politicians,''
said businessman Lloyd Noble II, chief backer of the limit on
legislative careers.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Charles H. Keating Jr., whose lavish
lifestyle, risky investments and political access made him a symbol
of the savings and loan scandal, was led away in shackles after
being charged with swindling junk-bond investors.
   Keating, whose Lincoln Savings and Loan collapsed in the
nation's biggest S&amp;L failure, was jailed on $5 million bail
Tuesday. Though accused of looting the thrift before it went under,
the 66-year-old Keating claims to be broke.
   Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner, in setting bail, said the
indictment contained serious allegations: selling securities by
false statements or omissions, selling securities without
qualifications and lying to the California Department of
Corporations.
   Three former executives in Keating's empire were indicted as
well.

   If you tape bad shows for a collection called
``America's Funniest Home Awfuls,'' boy, have you got a treat
tonight. It's the two-hour premiere of a new CBS series, ``The
Flash.''
   The series is based on the comic book hero who likes to wear a
red skin-tight bodystocking with a mask and a hood that has winged
ears that look like car door handles. You know, the sort of guy you
find in punk rock clubs.
   Only this one fights crime at incredible speed.
   How bad is the CBS effort? It makes similar tableaus, like
yesteryear's ``Six Million Dollar Man'' and ``Bionic Woman,''
resemble high art.
   It doesn't help that the show's handsome young star, John Wesley
Shipp, appears to have studied acting at the Wooden School of
Tights and Drama.
   It's a shame. But Shipp just is not believable, particularly in
a crucial early scene when he exceeds 347 mph on a laboratory
treadmill, then asks, ``What's happening to me?''
   The Flash he plays lives in a dark, metropolis called Central
City, where the streets are always wet, with clouds of rising steam
here and there.
   It vaguely resembles the city in the movie version of ``Dick
Tracy'' (are there no TV or movie producers who don't read comic
books nowadays?).
   Those who don't know the origins of The Flash will learn tonight
that he is a police crime lab ace named Barry Allen. Barry is
transformed into a real whiz when a lightning bolt hits his
laboratory and sprays a lot of chemicals on him.
   A member of a family of cops, Barry has a girlfriend, Iris
(Paula Marshall), a computer artist. She doesn't want to get
married yet Good thing he also has a dog named Earl.
   Barry's older married brother, Jay (Tim Thomerson), is a veteran
motorcyle cop heading a task force to wipe out The Dark Riders - an
extremely evil subterranean motorcyle gang led by an anti-social
activist (Michael Nader).
   The Dark Riders' leader, whose face is horribly scarred by bad
makeup, is . . . surprise, an ex-cop gone wrong. For starters, he
wears a ponytail.
   The Dark Riders like to throw bombs and shoot automatic weapons
as they roar by in the night. They like to do this even when the
police chief, in a speech familiar to New Yorkers, is telling the
press:
   ``Your police department is determined to give you back your
streets and rid them of the fear that keeps us all awake at
night.''
   After the gang roars in and shoots and bombs, the ubiquituous TV
reporter asks Jay for a statement. Snarls Jay: ``We're gonna bury
these guys, and you can quote me on that.''
   (Er, Jay, she doesn't have to quote you on that, she's got that
on videotape and . . . awww, never mind.)
   Meanwhile, kid brother Barry, who long ago promised his Mom he'd
never become a street cop, starts evolving into the crime-fighting
Flash after the lightning bolt alters his body and way of life.
   But it is hard. He can't figure out why he runs so fast his
shoes smoke or why he eats more than 10 TV dinners at one sitting.
A good doctor would tell him it's because he watches too much MTV.
   But this is CBS, so he has to go to a secret government lab and
become the subject of tests by Tina McGee, a lovely, widowed
scientist played by Amanda Pays (Pays can act, and thus stands out
here).
   There is a nifty scene when, during a test, he breaks the speed
of sound on a race track, then scoops her up and does it again. It
is nifty because she is wearing clothes that endure the speed of
sound, a fashion first.
   Tina, who starts helping him, is the only one who knows his
secret.
   This is good, because most of the show - despite all the
bombing, shooting, attempted prison breakouts and high-speed blurs
of red - is strictly from arrrrrrgh.
   There is one moment of high drama, when the bad ex-cop kills his
hated foe -Jay, the head of the Dark Rider task force. But all is
lost when The Flash arrives, holds his dead brother in his arms and
emits a loud cry.
   The cry is supposed to indicate anguish. Instead, it sounds as
The Flash just suffered a snapped truss.
   For the record, the script is by the show's executive producers,
Danny Bilson and Paul DeMeo. The show comes from Pet Fly
Productions, which may explain everything.

   SAM DONALDSON GETS HIS: ABC's Sam Donaldson, known to bellow a
question now and then, will be ``roasted'' in Washington next
Tuesday in a dinner to raise funds for the Spinal Bifida
Association of America. The association says former Presidents
Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan will contribute videotaped barbs for
the joke-filled roast of the former White House correspondent, who

<HEAD>Souter Wants to Make the Constitution `A Reality for Our Time'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sometimes the obvious, simple question is the
tough one. Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter is a judge who
studies the precedents, so he was ready when asked why he wants the
job he's about to get.
   Souter told his confirmation hearing that he loves the
judiciary, wants no calling but to be a judge, and would seek on
the high court to serve as a steward of the Constitution.
   He said it is the greatest responsibility a judge can undertake,
``to join with eight other people to make the promises of the
Constitution a reality for our time and to preserve that
Constitution for the generations that will follow us after we are
gone from here.''
   That's an unassailable if vague answer to a question that would
seem elementary for any nominee or office-seeker. It isn't always
answered effectively.
   When Sen. Edward M. Kennedy was asked why he wanted to be
president as he prepared to run in 1980, his awkward, rambling
attempt to answer became a campaign liability.
   Robert H. Bork told the contentious Senate hearing on his doomed
nomination to the Supreme Court that service there would be ``an
intellectual feast.'' He also said he wanted to contribute to
maintaining constitutional government as he saw it.
   Bork, of course, had spelled out the way he saw it, in lectures,
writings, and rulings as a federal appeals judge that established
positions on most major constitutional issues of the times.
   Souter has not.
   Three days of questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee
didn't change that. Souter talked about himself, about his
experiences, about his judicial philosophy, about dozens of
decisions and precedents. But he did not telegraph to skeptical
liberals or to newly wary conservatives just where he would stand
on the questions awaiting the closely divided court - matters
including abortion, civil rights and criminal justice.
   Souter foreclosed answers to the abortion question early in the
process, declining to discuss the court's 1973 ruling or to express
his personal opinion on abortion.
   At the same time, he said that he believes the 14th Amendment to
the Constitution ``does recognize and does protect an unenumerated
right of privacy.'' That position doesn't fit the conservative
agenda.
   The ruling that legalized abortions was based on the right to
privacy, something Bork had said was invented by the court. That
was one contentious point among many at the 1987 hearings on his
court nomination. Bork is a formidable legal scholar. He showed it
in disputing critics and, at times, questioners.
   Souter was said to have reviewed the Bork hearings and to have
watched videotapes of some points in that testimony as he prepared
for his own confirmation hearings.
   Souter was no less the scholar; some of his answers came
complete with footnotes as he cited legal history, Supreme Court
cases and provisions of the Constitution.
   At the same time, he sought to dispel the notion that a
51-year-old bachelor who still lives in his boyhood home in a small
New Hampshire town - he remarked, rather proudly, that ``I still
have a black and white TV'' - is isolated from everyday concerns,
remote, a theorist rather than a judge who can understand real
world concerns.
   He worked at countering that impression from the beginning,
saying that his first lesson as a judge was that ``at the end of
our task, some human being is going to be affected, some human life
is going to be changed in some way by what we do.''
   He answered some questions by speaking of personal experiences -
a wrenching, two-hour counseling session with a pregnant woman who
was considering self-abortion a quarter-century ago when he was a
freshman adviser at Harvard College; a boyhood in which he never
heard a racial slur in his household; a contempt for discrimination
reinforced by seeing anti-Semitism against his friend, Sen. Warren
Rudman of New Hampshire.
   He was deferential. When he declined to answer, he said he did
so with respect, not by choice but because he couldn't respond
without jeopardizing ``the integrity of the judicial process.''
   Even when the questions took on an edge, Souter did not.
   ``I think the nation is served well by seeing me, and by seeing
you,'' he told the senators.
   In Souter, people who watched the televised hearings saw a man
who looks, acts and seems to think like a judge, on or off the
bench. ``I have loved the judiciary,'' he said. ``I have been a
trial judge, I have been an appellate judge and I want to be
nothing else.''

<HEAD>After Two Years Of Drought, Farmers Get A Crop - But Who Will Buy
It?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MENSING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STERLING, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For two years, the powdery soil on David
Lang's farm refused to yield a crop. This year, he finally got rain
and about 1,500 acres of golden wheat. But he's stuck with it.
   A world wheat glut totaling more than 21.6 billion bushels is
holding down prices, experts say. The U.S. wheat crop alone is
expected to total a record 2.76 billion bushels, up 35 percent from
last year.
   ``There's a wheat war going on,'' said Neal Fisher, director of
the North Dakota Wheat Commission. ``Canadians sold wheat to China
about two weeks ago for something around $2.50 a bushel. The
European Community is selling it for $2.05.''
   North Dakota farmers like Lang are getting about $2.20 per
bushel for their wheat, at least $1 less than last year and the
lowest they've seen in at least five years, Fisher said. Farmers in
North Dakota and elsewhere say their costs to produce a bushel of
wheat are at least three times that much.
   Many farmers and their congressional representatives want more
federal export bonuses to increase sales and better loan rates for
farmers. Some have asked for a fundamental re-evaluation of the
U.S. wheat-price structure.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter defends the current USDA
policy, saying that if U.S. farmers plant less or put more in
storage, their competitors in other countries will only plant more.
He also says the USDA has increased its export bonuses at the risk
of driving the market lower.
   ``Prices are down because wheat farmers have had excellent
yields here and elsewhere in the world, at a time when demand from
some of our major customers has declined unpredictably,'' Yeutter
said recently.
   ``We're doing all we can to help move U.S. wheat in the
marketplace in a sensible way,'' he added.
   But for Lang and other farmers it's a hard blow after two years
in which nothing would grow. Strong livestock prices are helping
him, he said. He can sell some of his 150 cattle, and he'll get a
USDA loan on his wheat to help pay bills.
   Under the loan program, at the end of nine months, farmers can
pay back the money and sell their wheat for a higher price, or the
government gets the grain. But farmers also say the loan rate,
currently less than $2 per bushel, is too low.
   Gov. George Sinner has suggested that farm-state governors ask
their farmers to hold wheat off the market.
   North Dakota expects to harvest a record 275 million bushels of
spring wheat and 104 million bushels of durum, a wheat variety used
in pasta, as part of a record U.S. wheat crop of 2.76 billion
bushels.
   The country may face more trouble if farmers can't make a
profit, Sinner said.
   ``The evidence is building very rapidly that we will probably
lose more farmers this year than any year previous,'' he said.
``The long-range future is so bleak to many farmers that they are
simply saying, `the hell with it.' ''

<HEAD>Several Hurdles On Road to 24-Hour Trading</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: This Subs for b0230 Column</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES M. KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Editor</BYLINE>

   They asked for a show of hands at a meeting this
week of financial market experts. Who thinks 24-hour market trading
has already arrived?
   A few hands waved affirmatively among the hundred or so
participants.
   Then, the follow-up question: Who thinks it will take lots more
money and time before 24-hour, global trading really takes off?
   Dozens of hands shot up amid a few knowing chuckles.
   The scene was a seminar on round-the-clock trading sponsored by
the Information Industry Association, a group of so-called ``data
vendors'' whose job is to disseminate market prices and analysis to
everyone from newspaper readers to professional traders.
   Representatives from the various stock and commodities markets
spoke on their plans for going global. A watchdog from the
Securities and Exchange Commission told how regulators would react.
The vendors themselves outlined the enormous logistical problems
and huge expense of wiring the world for continuous trading.
   Few conclusions were reached, except that much work remains to
be done.
   The few who said 24-hour trading was already a reality were
right. Big market players have been burning the midnight oil and
cutting deals electronically in London and Tokyo for some time.
   But what they're talking about now is institutionalizing this
sort of thing, making after-hours trading a regular part of doing
business in the markets.
   They want to set up shop on the moon, not just land on it.
   Whether American astronauts will get back to the moon before
average American investors trade stocks in the middle of the night
is anyone's guess. Some of the hurdles left to jump are
staggeringly high.
   The principal concern right now, in the middle of a recession on
Wall Street, is the cost.
   Everyone with an eye on this future marketplace agrees it can't
be built without a tremendous capital investment. The basic tool of
a 24-hour market is a computer system that never goes down, speaks
all languages, executes trades in a wink from point A to point Z,
and updates itself while it works.
   That's some invention, with some price tag.
   Who will build it? Mostly joint ventures, like the Globex
partnership for trading futures and options being developed by the
Chicago Board of Trade, Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters
Holdings PLC.
   The people who eventually make money on 24-hour trading will be
the ones who commit the money to erecting the framework, Charles
Lebens, chairman of Bridge Information Systems, told the meeting of
data vendors.
   The issue of standards is just as critical. For the market to
move efficiently across borders and time zones, common formats and
guidelines must be established for traders.
   Currently, world traders find it difficult to agree on the
simplest things, even ticker symbols.
   ``Take Volvo,'' explained Lebens. ``There are nine different
symbols for it in nine different markets and some don't even begin
with `V'.''
   There are also different currencies and exchange rates to worry
about, different rules for public disclosure of trades, and all
sorts of technical headaches.
   One elementary, but nonetheless vexing, question is when to
declare the end of the day for record-keeping - 4 p.m. Eastern
time, 6 p.m., midnight, 5 o'clock the next morning? Pick one.
   The regulatory questions are equally sticky. How do you police a
market that never closes and conducts business across international
borders? Regulators around the world have begun to consider the
problem under the leadership of the SEC, but officials are bound to
have their hands full keeping files, enforcing rules and tracking
crooks around the world.
   The SEC, mostly known for reacting to the market's needs instead
of anticipating them, will likely need a budget infusion to move
more aggressively on these fronts. That means Congress must be
heard from on the question of 24-hour trading before too long.
   The consequences of taking shortcuts to the global future will
be severe, the experts agree. Without adequate standards,
infrastructure and police, the action is bound to get rough.
   It's also bound to push the little guy farther away from the
market than he's already been shoved.
   This move to 24-hour business is fundamentally different from
opening up the supermarket or the cash machine all night. It's not
being done for the convenience of the working stiff who'd like to
buy some IBM on the way home from the late shift.
   Global trading is mainly a business for big guns. For instance,
the New York Stock Exchange's plan for after-hours trading later
this year is designed for institutional investors who move millions
of shares of stock by computr.
   Some might say the disenfranchisement of the small investor is
inevitable, notwithstanding global trading. After all, few people
today still sit around the kitchen table picking stocks out of the
evening paper. If they're in the market at all, they're buying
generic shares of it through mutual funds or through contributions
to pension funds.
   Despite this trend, the rocket to the investing moon will lose a
valuable passenger if it takes off without Mr. and Mrs. America.
The challenge for those now mulling plans for a global market will
be to make it safe and accessible for everyone.
   Unless the market that never closes is truly open, the builders
may find it wasn't worth the investment.

<HEAD>Mercury Tracer: Trying To Lure Small-Car Buyers Back</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1991 Tracer is Lincoln-Mercury's latest attempt to lure
small-car, Japanese import buyers back into its showrooms.
   ``We looked at what people are paying for their vehicles,
equipped,'' said Ian McAllister, general marketing manager at
Lincoln-Mercury. ``We find people buying Japanese products for
about $1,200 to $2,000 more than what they could be paying for a
Tracer - that's comparing median prices.''
   Surveys show that car buyers know about the company's bigger
models - the Sable, Grand Marquis and Cougar - and ``they give us
credit for cars that are well-made,'' McAllister said.
   But Lincoln-Mercury isn't so readily on consumers' lists when
they shop for small, well-built cars.
   The 1991 Tracer is designed to change that. Built on the same
platform as the 1991 Ford Escort, the Tracer line includes a
station wagon version to appeal to young families who increasingly
are deciding against hatchbacks. The previous Tracer design,
introduced in 1986, was a hatchback.
   The 1991 Tracer LTS test car also had standard sport handling
suspension offering good road feel without a punishing ride.
Exceptionally long wheel travel in the strut suspension helped ease
road imperfections, a feature normally found on larger, heavier
vehicles.
   The car featured a standard rear decklid spoiler and cast
aluminum wheels that, when added to the minimum of chrome on the
Tracer, made for a modern, sporty look.
   Standard equipment included a four-way adjustable driver seat,
rear window defroster, tilt steering and four-wheel disc brakes.
Base price for the LTS was $11,219, though the least expensive
model, the Tracer sedan, begins at $8,969 plus destination charge.
   The test car came with a 1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine and
four-speed overdrive transmission. The dual-overhead cam, 16-valve
powerplant is also used in the Escort GT and produces up to 127
horsepower.
   Power was adequate in city driving but less so on the highway.
There were occasional jerks in my demanding, pedal-to-the-metal
drives as the transmission shifted, especially when the air
conditioner was on.
   Still, I averaged about 28 miles per gallon - commendable
considering all the unkind maneuvers I put the car through. The EPA
rating is 23 mpg in the city and 30 on the highway.
   The Tracer LTS is fairly roomy for a compact. Front and rear
seats were well-cushioned, though rather flat. Legroom in back was
admirable. Even with the front seats all the way back, I could tuck
my feet under them and not hit my knees on the front seatbacks.
Three children might manage OK in the rear seat, but three adults
might find it to be a tight squeeze.
   The Tracer is imported from Ford Motor Co.'s factory in
Hermosillo, Mexico, but the company says 75 percent of the car's
components are American-made.
   Lincoln-Mercury expects the new design to attract slightly
younger buyers and more families with children.
   Consumer Reports magazine ranked the 1988 version average in
owner reports of trouble.

<HEAD>`Nostra Aetate' Spawned Growing Jewish-Christian Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-five years ago the Second Vatican Council
issued a document that spurred a transformation in Jewish-Christian
relations.
   Called ``Nostra Aetate,'' Latin for ``In Our Time,'' the
declaration has been followed by a proliferation of guidelines and
understandings on ties between Christians and Jews.
   Religious scholars gathered at Fordham University last week to
assess the impact of the document. Among the comments: It
``represents one of the true success stories of the 20th century.''
It was a ``turning point,'' a ``reconsideration of the soul.'' Now
``it is possible to dream realistically.''
   ``Something irreversible and irrevocable has happened in our
nearly 2000-year-long story,'' said Rabbi A. James Rudin,
interreligious affairs director for the American Jewish Committee.
   He termed the change a rare success story.
   Calling it ``reconsideration of the soul'' on both sides, Eugene
J. Fisher, director for Catholic-Jewish relations of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, said: ``Peace in its fullness, in
the sense of the Hebrew word, shalom, appears to be breaking out
between us.''
   He said that ``we are graced to live in a time when it is
possible to dream realistically'' of Christians and Jews standing
``together in solidarity'' in mending the world, ``a task to which
both of our peoples are called by God.''
   Some participants saw such active bonds as essential in
resisting a galloping secularism of the times.
   Observance of the 25th anniversary of the Vatican document came
near the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashana, this past Wednesday, start
of Judaism's high holy days culminating Sept. 29 on Yom Kippur, the
Day of Atonement.
   While Jewish-Christian dialogues and cooperative approaches have
multiplied since the Vatican council's declaration, it staked out
the grounds for the expanding mutual ties.
   The declaration, like similar preceding statements by Protestant
and Eastern Orthodox denominations of the World Council of
Churches, affirmed these basic principles:
   - That Christianity ``draws sustenance'' from roots in Judaism,
to which Gentiles are grafted; that Jesus, the apostles and most
his early followers were Jews and God has not revoked his covenant
with Jews.
   - That the church, ``mindful of the patrimony she shares'' with
Judaism, repudiates every form of anti-Semitism and specificially
the long-festering ``deicide'' charge that blamed Jews as a people
for Jesus' crucifixion.
   ``Christ out of infinite love freely underwent his passion and
death for the sins of all men,'' the declaration said.
   In the Fordham conference marking those landmark principles and
the numerous ties and standards developed since, partipants also
noted strains that have occurred and said further steps are needed.
   ``Religion should not be a wall, but a door - an opportunity to
meet `the other' as he or she knows himself or herself,'' said
Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel, a Jewish survivor of the Nazi
holocaust.
   ``We are all created in God's image. We all bear responsibility
for one another,'' he added, urging joint efforts against hunger,
disease, violence, drugs, crime and social humililiation.
   ``In joining hands, I will not be less Jewish, nor will you be
less Catholic,'' he said. ``Each religion is good for its own
adherents. Judaism is good for me, just as Christianity is good for
you . . .
   ``In choosing to follow Christ, future Christians left Judaism
and chose Christianity, just as Jews chose to remain Jewish. Is
that bad? Not at all. Rapproachment means diversity, not
uniformity.
   ``Remember - and we shall learn to respect one another for what
we are meant to be: a mirror to each other. I look at you, and I
ask myself not whether you are a good Christian, but whether I am a
good Jew. Should not the same be true of you?''
   Monsignor George G. Higgins, a theologian of the Catholic
University of America, cited an ``over-privatization of religion''
and said Christians and Jews should work together in deepening
religious values in society.
   ``It is our common calling as Jews and Christians to make known
the name of the one God among all nations of the earth in every age
and jointly to serve the cause of peace and justice among the
peoples of the earth,'' he said.
   Concurring with Higgins, Albert Vorspan, a Reform Jewish leader
and vice president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations,
said religious forces should ``help shape public values.''
   ``Separation of church and state does not mean separating
spirituality and social justice, or closeting religion or religious
politics in the church, the synagogue or the mosque,'' he said.
   Several Jewish participants, including Wiesel and Rudin,
stressed the importance to Jews of Israel, and questioned why the
Vatican still withholds diplmatic recognition from the Jewish
state.
   Rudin also said ``pervasive irreligious secularism'' threatens
to push both Judaism and Christianity aside. In battling such
pressures, he said, ``the sense of solidarity'' between Christians
and Jews is indispensable.

   Episcopal officials say tensions between Kenya's
government and churches were worsened by the death of Anglican
Bishop Alexander Muge after his life was threatened by a government
minister.
   The incident has made the church a ``principal vehicle of
opposition to the government'' of President Daniel Moi, said Bishop
Furman Stough, a New York Episcopal executive after returning from
Muge's funeral. ``Either the Moi government will begin to lift some
of the restrictions or things will become much worse.''
   Muge, who had demanded sweeping changes in Kenya's one-party
political system, was killed in a automobile accident Aug. 14 in
the Busia district. The death occured just a day after a government
Cabinet minister warned the bishop he might be killed if he entered
the area.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - A Maryknoll Roman Catholic priest has been
disciplined for concelebrating Mass with women at St. Joan of Arc
parish.
   The Rev. Roy Bourgeois defended his action, saying church
policies unjustly exclude women from ordination. After the service
in which three women joined in consecrating the bread and wine, the
congregation cheered.
   Archbishop John R. Roach barred Bourgeois from further priestly
duties in the diocese, ordered an inquiry and reported the matter
to the U.S. papal representative.

   NEW YORK (AP) - New York Lutheran Bishop William H. Lazareth
wished Lutheran author Richard J. Neuhaus well in his switch to
Roman Catholicism, but said such moves can slow ecumenical efforts.
   While Lutherans and Roman Catholics are working for agreement on
the gospel, ``ecumenical gridlock results whenever this church
consensus is replaced by personal conversions in either
direction,'' he said.

   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Evangelist Billy Graham says he worries
about possible war in the Persian Gulf, but he is delighted about
the end of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet
Union.
   Recalling how he was criticized for speaking at a Moscow peace
conference several years ago, he said that in the contrasting
climate now, leaders of the two superpowers are calling each other
by friendly nicknames.
   ``I heard George Bush call Mr. Gorbachev `Gorby' the other
day,'' Graham said. ``I guess he (Gorbachev) calls him `Georgie'.''
   At a new conference prior to being given the Charlotte World
Affairs Council's first World Citizen Award, Graham, 71, said of
the Gulf crisis:
   ``I pray every day for those men we have over in that hot desert
sun and sand. I hope for a peaceful solution. We don't need a
shooting war.''

<HEAD>Confronting Nationalism, East Europeans Must Remake States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRATISLAVA, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As they abandon Communism,
East Europeans are confronting old nationalist passions that gnaw
at their nascent democracies and force them to remake their states
as well as their ravaged economies.
   Tension between majority Czechs and minority Slovaks, who make
up about one-third of Czechoslovakia's 15.5 million people, has
brought the promise of large-scale constitutional reform.
   By loudly demanding more independence and even going so far as
to establish their own ministry for international relations, the
Slovaks have won agreements to pass most power from Prague to the
Czech and Slovak republics.
   Under arrangements to be completed next year, the federal
government effectively will run only defense, foreign policy and
major economic issues such as regulating the currency.
   Even foreign affairs will not be Prague's sole domain. Slovakia
will get its own consulates and cultural centers in countries like
Canada or Switzerland with large Slovak emigre populations.
   Yet this may not quell nationalism in Slovakia, the more rural,
eastern third of the country.
   Across eastern Europe, ethnic groups deprived by centuries of
foreign rule of opportunities to show their identity are seeking it
with vengeance.
   In much of central Europe, the sense of grievance is real; old
slights can be whipped into collective aversion, even hatred.
   For centuries, Slovaks were ruled by Hungary, which until 1830
crowned its kings in Bratislava, then known by the Hungarian name
Pozsony. Independence in 1918 was welcome, but union with the
Czechs bred new resentments.
   ``The lack of Slovak intelligentsia meant that Czechs got hold
of all the important posts,'' said Jan Petrik, a senior official in
Slovakia's second-largest party, the Christian Democrats.
   Mutual Czech-Slovak suspicion grew during World War II. The
Czechs were occupied by the Nazis, while a Nazi puppet state was
established in Slovakia.
   A federation was devised during the brief ``Prague Spring''
reforms in 1968. But the authoritarian rule reimposed after the
Warsaw Pact invasion ensured federation was little more than a
formality.
   ``Prague centralism comes between Slovakia and the world,'' said
Vitazoslav Moric, leader of the pro-independence Slovak National
Party, which won 10 percent of the vote in June elections. ``The
Czechs as a nation have nothing to do with it. Prague as the center
expropriated certain power and doesn't want to give it up.''
   President Vaclav Havel attributes a special role in the
resurgence of nationalist feeling to the uniformity imposed by the
Soviet Union for 40 years.
   ``Rid of the uniforms and masks that were imposed on us, we are
looking for the first time into each others' faces,'' Havel said
recently. He suggested it was a shock to recognize differences.
   This ``shock of otherness,'' Havel suggested, is enhanced by
fear that an ethnic rival may be shouting louder and getting more
attention.
   Ethnic slights can be felt keenly as people drop the reserve
that governed casual acquaintance when everybody feared the secret
police.
   Little is done to break down stereotypes.
   Media freed of Communist constraints print as they wish. But
Slovak dailies are barely available in the Czech lands, and only
one Czech daily has a correspondent in Slovakia.
   ``Our nations communicate with one another so insufficiently
that it is almost frightening,'' said Czech Premier Petr Pithart.
   Communications barriers reinforce the desire of minorities to be
heard.
   ``If we don't demand, nobody is going to give it to us,'' said
Petrik. ``We have to be cheeky.''
   This fosters defiant gestures such as the appointment of actor
Milan Knazko, a key Havel ally, as Slovakia's minister of
international relations.
   Then, it is the majority's turn to feel aggrieved.
   Pithart repeatedly has reminded the Czechs that Slovaks are
``not Siamese twins'' or ``Czechs who speak Slovak'' and have a
case for being treated differently.
   He and Slovak counterpart Vladimir Meciar put faith in the
success of economic reform and the institutionalization of human
rights to overcome nationalist passions.
   ``If humanitarian values do not become decisive in Slovakia,
there will never be stability,'' Meciar said.
   But the situation is complicated, as elsewhere in eastern
Europe, by the minority-within-a-minority, the 600,000 ethnic
Hungarians in Slovakia. They resent attempts to make Slovak -
taught in their Hungarian-language schools - an official language.
   The Slovaks, meanwhile, bitterly accuse Hungarian media of
painting a distorted picture of the misery of Slovak Hungarians.
   Even if ethnic claims quiet down, more bitter battles loom.
Slovakia's Christian Democrats, for instance, are determined to
stiffen the relatively lax abortion law, something unlikely to be
welcomed in the less religious Czech lands.

   Skyrocketing oil costs pushed retail prices up
0.8 percent last month as the Persian Gulf crisis began hitting
Americans' wallets, the government said.
   The seasonally adjusted increase in the Labor Department's
Consumer Price Index was double the 0.4 percent rise in July and
the largest since January, when a severe cold snap pushed prices up
1.1 percent, the department said Tuesday.
   In a separate report signalling slackening economic growth, the
Commerce Department reported the sharpest increase in the trade
deficit since August 1982. Americans imported $9.33 billion more
than they exported in July, up 75 percent from June.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Charles H. Keating, the man blamed by the
government for the nation's biggest savings and loan collapse, was
jailed in lieu of $5 million bail after he was indicted on criminal
fraud charges.
   The former chairman of American Continental Corp. and three
other executives were charged in a 42-count state indictment with
selling securities by false statements or omissions, selling
securities without qualifications and lying to the Clifornia
Department of Corporations.
   The department approved the sale of the high-risk, high-yield
junk bonds, technically known as unsecured debentures, at branches
of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, which Keating
controlled through American Continental.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - By spending $22 billion in cash next year the
government could save $3 billion to $4 billion in aid payments to
savings and loans bailed out in 1988, regulators said.
   In a long-awaited report Tuesday, the Resolution Trust Corp.
reviewed ways to cut the $69 billion cost of 96 bailouts conducted

   DETROIT (AP) - General Motors Corp. threw billions of dollars at
the United Auto Workers to mollify labor and clear the way for
closing unprofitable plants, under a three-year contract that
negotiators agreed on.
   The world's largest automaker will make available more than $4
billion to assure workers will be paid if they are laid off when
plants close, under the deal that got the union bargaining
council's unanimous approval on Tuesday. Analysts say such closings
are inevitable if GM is to become more competitive and regain
market share lost to U.S. and foreign rivals.

   CHICAGO (AP) - The government's explanation of how business is
done at the Chicago Board of Trade is a ``far cry'' from reality, a
defense attorney argued in the fraud and conspiracy trial of 10
soybean traders.
   Matt A. Lydon, the first of the defendants' attorneys to give
opening statements, tried Tuesday to punch holes in opening
statements by Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Durkin, who claimed that
customers have been cheated at the futures exchange.
   The trial before U.S. District Judge George M. Marovich is the

the Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

union, said a national energy union is the only way to win

   Trumka, addressing the UMW's 100th anniversary convention

multinational oil and coal conglomerates with diversified
interests.
   He said unions had to ``do what we must to challenge those
corporate Goliaths n their own turf, not only as the union of the
coal fields, but as the union of energy workers.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Uncertainty in the Persian Gulf and fears of
``stagflation'' have scared investors away from the British stock
market, where trading volume is down sharply.
   The slow business is depressing for London's already battered
tradin rooms, and might undermine the government's upcoming sale
of the electric power system.
   Although prices have held up better in London than in Tokyo or
New York, August's average volume of 312 million shares was 22
percent lower than a year ago.
   Analysts say the big investors are standing pat, small investors
are bailing out and dealers have idle hours to contemplate the
likelihood of more layoffs in the financial district by Christmas.
   ``Volume is what we earn our living from,'' said Robert
Buckland, market strategist at County Natwest Woodmac Ltd.
   Investor caution also threatens to undermine Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's biggest and most complex privatization, the
sale of Britain's electric industry beginning in November.
   Volume became more important to the market following the Big
Bang, the 1986 deregulation of Britain's financial markets that
attracted a lot of new players who now are struggling to make a
profit.
   Trading on London's Stock Exchange came to 379.2 million shares
on Tuesday, up from 286.6 million shares Monday, but down from
Friday's 418 million shares.
   Most trading represents reactions to news developments rather
than long-term investments, Buckland said.
   ``I'd say the low volume is No. 1 a product of uncertainty in
the market,'' Buckland said. ``Investors are unwilling to commit
themselves to a market which they just can't predict. ''
   These reluctant investors, sitting on the sidelines with big
cash holdings, are uncertain about the outcome of the Gulf crisis,
Buckland said.
   The crisis, he added, also ``brought forth the horror word that
everybody is scared to see: stagflation.''
   Britain has both ingredients of stagflation: slowing economic
growth under the pressure of 15 percent interest rates, and high
inflation of 10.6 percent in August.
   Inflation prospects have worsened worldwide since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices soaring above $30 a barrel.
   These problems are occuring simultaneously with another
disturbing trend in the London market, said Anthony Winnington, a
director of equities trading at the London investment firm Hoare
Govett Ltd.
   ``Generally there has been an exodus of the small shareholder
from London this last year,'' Winnington said. ``They've become
more disillusioned with the stock market.''
   Britons' appetite for shares will be tested when the government
begins selling 12 electric distribution companies in two months.
The entire three-stage sale, including most of Britain's generating
capacity, could raise more than $38 billion.
   ``It's very important for the government that that (sale) be
seen as a success,'' Winnington said. ``It's got to attract into
the market the people who have been leaving in droves.''
   That won't happen unless interest rates are cut, he said.
   The government's sales of nationalized industries over the past
decade generally have been successful, with one notable exception:
the sell-off of the government's remaining one-third stake in
British Petroleum Co. PLC, which coincided with the October 1987
stock market crash and flopped with investors. Underwriters got
stuck with the stock.
   The crash depressed trading volume, prompting dealers to pull
out of equity trading and forcing job cuts.
   The number of equity market makers, dealers who buy and sell
shares continuously at posted prices, has shrunk to 25 from a
post-Big Bang peak of 33.
   Employment at member firms fell 4 percent to 24,400 at the end
of last year, from a peak of 25,500 in mid-1988, the exchange says.
   Pre-tax profit for all the firms fell to $158 million in 1989's
fourth quarter, compared with $312 million in the third quarter, it
sas.
   ``There is still a lot of overcapacity and an awful lot of
pretty idle dealers in dealing rooms in the City,'' or financial
district, Winnington said. He said further job losses could come by
Christmas.

<BYLINE>FCC Plans ``Attic-to-Basement'' Review of Its Broadcast Rules
^By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next spring, there'll be ``an
attic-to-basement'' review of Federal Communications Commission
broadcast regulations to see if changes are needed, FCC chairman
Alfred C. Sikes said.
   ``We will be looking at the structural rules to determine which
ones promote diversity and which - in a `new media' world - might
threaten it,'' he said in a speech here Tuesday.
   ``We must worry about diversity in today and tomorrow's world,
not yesterday's,'' Sikes told broadcasters attending a lunch held
by the International Radio and Television Society.
   However, he didn't specify which areas the FCC will look at, a
review prompted by changes that new technology and markets have
creted in mass electronic communications.
   In a question-and-answer session with those at the lunch, he
suggested that the cable industry, worried about proposals to
re-regulate it, may get a breather until next year.
   The dragged-out House-Senate negotiations on the federal budget
may mean there'll be no time left this year for a final vote by
Congress on cable legislation, he said.
   Only a month ago, he said, he would have said he felt ``there
was a substantial likeliehood'' of a final vote by both houses this
year.
   But now, ``I think that in some ways the fate of the cable
legislation is tied to (federal) budget negotiations,'' he said.
   As talks continue and if negotiators ``tighten the rules on
floor action in Congress, it would seem to me that the cable
legislation will run out of time'' for a final vote before the
current session of Congress ends, he said.
   The House passed a cable bill on Sept. 10, but action on a cable
measure in the Senate still is pending.
   The Bush administration strongly opposes the House bill, saying
that Congress should instead encourage new forms of competition to
cable.
   The cable industry, which according to Nielsen estimates now
serves 58.9 percent of the nation's 93.1 million homes with TV, was
largely freed of regulation by Congress six years ago.
   The House bill was passed in response to increasing complaints
about rising prices and shoddy cable TV service. Among other
things, it would impose federal price limits on basic cable
service.
   It also would give the FCC power to order price rollbacks on the
worst offenders, and boost competition to cable, which now serves
58.9 percent of the nation's 93.1 million homes with TV, according
to Nielsen estimates.
   The FCC in July told Congress that it felt the best way to
benefit the viewing public was to encourage competition to cable
TV, such as satellite broadcasting, instead of re-imposing
regulation of rates and services.

   Charles H. Keating Jr., whose lavish
lifestyle and risky investments helped make him a symbol of the
savings and loan crisis, was led away in shackles after he was
charged with swindling junk-bond investors.
   Keating was taken to the 6,700-inmate county jail near downtown
Los Angeles Tuesday where he was being held on $5 million bail.
   Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner, in setting the bail, noted
that a 42-count grand jury indictment contains serious allegations:
selling securities by false statements or omissions, selling
securities without qualifications and lying to the California
Department of Corporations.
   The bonds issued by the company Keating headed, American
Continental Corp., were sold at branches of its subsidiary,
Irvine-based Lincoln Savings. They became virturally worthless when
Lincoln was seized and American Continental wound up in bankruptcy
court.
   Prosecutors told Klausner that the 20 listed victims typify
22,000 investors who lost $250 million on the bonds that were far
riskier than they were led to believe.
   It was the first criminal case filed against Keating, 66, of
Paradise Valley, Ariz. The cost of bailing out Lincoln has been
estimated at $2 billion.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner declined to describe in detail how
the bonds were misrepresented.
   At a press conference Tuesday after a special grand jury's
indictment was unsealed, Reiner said only 20 victims were named to
simplify the case and avoid confusing a jury.
   ``We tried to have this be a very tightly focused case,'' Reiner
said. ``I think we have put together a case that can be prosecuted
and prosecuted successfully.''
   Keating's co-defendants were held on $1 million bail each.
   They are Judy Elizabeth Wischer, 42, of Paradise Valley, former
president of American Continental; Ray Charles Fidel, 32, of
Newport Beach, former president of Lincoln; and Robin Scott Symes,
37, of Malvern, Ohio, former chief executive officer of Lincoln.
   Symes' attorney, Don Smaltz, called the bail amounts
``outrageous,'' saying they were motivated only by hysteria and
politics of the case.
   Reiner noted that taxpayers will have to absorb most of the
losses from the nation's savings and loan debacle, whose bailout is
now estimated to cost $500 billion. That's because the federal
government insured thrift accounts up to $100,000.
   But there was no insurance for the bonds sold at Lincoln. The
American Continental securities carried high interest rates because
they were unsecured, meaning investors had little recourse if the
company was unable to pay its debts.
   ``These bonds were sold ... principally to elderly people who
typically invested their life savings,'' Reiner said.
   In limiting the case to 20 defendants, Reiner cited complicated
fraud prosecutions that failed in other states. But he also
appeared to be referring indirectly to the byzantine McMartin
Pre-School molestation case.
   Reiner, who is running for re-election, suffered career damage
when the McMartin case ended without a conviction after years in
which it became the nation's longest and costliest criminal
prosecution.
   Keating is under criminal investigation by federal authorities
in connection with his alleged looting of Lincoln. The Arizona
developer also faces a slew of civil actions including a $1.1
billion racketeering case filed by the federal thrift bailout
agency. An administrative action by the Office of Thrift
Supervision seeks $40.9 million connected to soured Lincoln deals.
   Keating says he is broke.

   The government could save $3 billion to $4
billion in aid payments to savings institutions bailed out in 1988
if Congress and the administration were willing to spend $22
billion next year, regulators say.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. said Tuesday that the $69 billion
cost of 96 bailouts in 1988 could be reduced over the next decade,
but only if Congress and the Bush administration spend the cash up
front.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the trust corporation, refrained
from offering his recommendation until his agency meets Thursday
with its oversight board, headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady.
   But several members of Congress spoke favorably about the idea.
   ``I regard the RTC's report on potential savings as only the
first cut in a long process to protect taxpayers on the deals,''
said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee.
   ``We owe the money one way or another. It just seems to me the
practical thing is to do this and get it over with,'' said Rep.
Bruce Vento, D-Minn., who chairs a House task force overseeing
bailouts conducted since 1988.
   However, in budget summit talks, administration and
congressional negotiators are having a hard time coming up with the
cash to provide for the rescue of a continuing flow of failed
thrifts, let alone money for past deals.
   The trust corporation, created last year by the S&amp;L bailout law,
is spending billions of dollars to wipe out the losses of
institutions that have failed since 1988.
   In the old rescues, the bank board was out of money and had to
keep the institutions afloat with various guarantees and promises
of future assistance.
   The 1988 transactions have come under increasing attack from
members of Congress who complain they amounted to a giveaway. The
House Banking Committee said last week that acquirers, on average,
invested only $1 to receive $78 in assets.
   ``Many of the 1988 deals were overly generous and costly to the
taxpayers,'' agreed Peter H. Monroe, president of the oversight
board.
   Much of the bank board's assistance took the form of promissory
notes with a guaranteed return. Often, the bank board promised to
guarantee profits on the sour loans and other bad assets of the
rescued thrifts.
   ``If you make deals and you don't have cash ... then you're
going to pay more in order to make a deal with the private
sector,'' Seidman said.
   Under the contracts, the government could save money over the
long haul by paying off the promissory notes or buying the bad
assets and selling them itself.
   However, the report cautioned that such action could force 17 of
the rescued thrifts, with $51 billion in assets, back into
insolvency. Seven of the bailed-out thrifts are already back in the
governments' hands.
   The report, which was required by Congress and cost $3.5
million, was based on research of five groups of private
accountants, lawyers, bankers and consultants hired by the trust
corporation.
   In a second report due in November, the trust corporation is
examining whether there is a legal basis to overturn any of the
1988 deals. So far, the agency has found no ground for revoking the
deals, Seidman said.
   Tuesday's report dealt only with legal options in the contracts
with acquirers of bailed-out thrifts.
   ``There is no effort to change the contract and the government
is in no way reneging on its obligations,'' Seidman said.

   Two months of hot, dry weather have
devastated Georgia's peanut crop and could force consumers to pay
higher prices for peanut butter.
   Don Koehler, executive director of the Georgia Peanut
Commission, said the 1990 crop will be the worst in a decade. He
predicted peanut growers will suffer $150 million in crop losses.
He estimated the loss to the state's economy at up to $600 million.
   Georgia is the nation's top peanut-producing state, accounting
for nearly half of U.S. production. Peanuts are also Georgia's top
cash crop.
   Georgia growers are expected to harvest 703,000 tons this year,
down 24 percent from last year.
   The Alabama and Florida crops, which represent 18 percent of
U.S. production, are down 21 percent. But some of the shortfall
will be made up by producers in Virginia, North Carolina, Oklahoma
and Texas, where growing conditions were better.
   The U.S. peanut harvest is expected to total 1.7 million tons,
down 11 percent from last year, but sufficient for domestic needs.
   Koehler said Tuesday offers to farmers have already increased 20
percent to $760 per ton and may increase further, depending on
weather and crop conditions.
   Mitch Head, executive director of the Peanut Advisory Board, an
Atlanta-based trade association representing Southeastern
producers, said retail peanut butter prices could increase from 5
percent to 10 percent.
   Head said the drought will leave fewer peanuts for export, but
should not create a shortage for U.S. consumers. Americans consumed
1.55 millions tons of peanut products last year.
   Emory Murphy, assistant executive director of the Peanut
Commission, said consumers should not see the higher peanut butter
prices until January, when manufacturers began turning the 1990
crop into peanut butter and other products.
   ``The increase will push a peanut butter sandwich cost up 1 cent
to 16.5 cents - still a nutritional bargain and one of the cheapest
protein sources in the American diet,'' Murphy said.

<HEAD>Study Finds Employees Questioning Benefits of Job Moves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's increasingly mobile work force is
starting to question the benefits of moving, particularly when it
affects children or a working spouse, a new study indicates.
   More women managers, more dual-career couples and more divorces
have given the work force a different makeup than it had a decade
ago.
   ``Because of these shifts, companies are finding that getting an
employee to transfer is not as straightforward as it once might
have been,'' according to the study by The Employee Relocation
Council, a professional association.
   Still, corporations are moving many more single, female and
dual-career employees than ever before.
   ``But the employees are beginning to recalculate the worth of
moving,'' said Linda K. Stroh, who headed the study conducted at
the J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern
University in suburban Evanston.
   This finding contrasts with that of a similar study conducted by
the school in 1978. The older study concluded that mobile employees
and their families of that era generally were very willing to move
and adjusted well to transfers.
   Now, though, single employees in particular are much more
selective about making moves, said Stroh. ``They're saying `No,'''
she said in a telephone interview Tuesday night.
   Divorced parents leaving communities where their children live
can create heart-wrenching problems.
   One father interviewed by Stroh, for example, said he bitterly
regrets his decision to make a job move.
   ``I can't tell you the sadness I feel to think I've lost that
relationship with my son,'' he told her. ``I thught it would work.
I was wrong.''
   One surprising finding of the new study, which surveyed 20
Fortune 500 corporations and more than 1,000 of their employees,
was working husbands' willingness to follow wives who were being
transferred.
   But Stroh said corporations are missing a good bet here because
married women are asked to move less often than men.
   With women making up 18 percent of the managerial work force
sampled, ``corporations are overlooking a pretty good segment of
their employees,'' she added.
   Families with teen-age children presented special problems.
   The more often a teen-ager had moved, the more difficulty the
teen had in adjusting, the study found. Yet, teens who participated
in the decision to move were happier about the change than those
who were not involved.
   The study also found that parents were more willing to move with
male teen-agers than with female teens.
   Based on their interviews, the researchers offered some advice
to corporations. They suggested, for instance, that corporations
should offer help in finding work for a relocated employee's
spouse. Such assistance, the researchers said, should include
offering job contacts and reimbursements for the cost of
career-planning guidance.
   A decade of mergers, acquisitions and other corporate turbulence
also has affected the way employees view job moves. The study found
that employees from business units where there had been mergers
were much less willing to move.
   One employee interviewed said takeovers and turbulence erode
loyalty to a company.
   Said Stroh, ``Those in more turbulent companies are more likely
to act as free agents in managing their careers.''

   Venezuela, Bolivia and Tunisia have joined the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, increasing membership of
the trade forum to 99 nations, it was announced Wednesday.
   A statement issued by the Geneva-based secretariat said all
three countries were in the process of reforms to open their
economies to international trade.
   Venezuela had cut import tariffs to 50 percent from levels as
high as 135 percent and pleged to cut them to 40 percent in two
years, the statement said.
   It said Bolivia had agreed to a 40 percent ceiling on tariffs,
while Tunisia had frozen import duties on 900 items at levels
ranging from 17 to 52 percent.
   GATT is a market-oriented forum which sets trade rules and
sponsors agreements to liberalize global commerce. Its members
account for more than four fifths of world trade.
   There are currently eight countries negotiating to become

<HEAD>Defense Says Charges Must Be Backed By Evidence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense attorneys cautioned jurors in the fraud
and conspiracy trial of 10 soybean traders that the prosecution's
claims of thievery must be backed by evidence.
   Matt A. Lydon, an attorney for one of the defendants, warned the
16 jurors in U.S. District Court on Tuesday that assistant U.S.
Attorney Tom Durkin must prove charges of conspiracy, fraud and
racketeering facing the Chicago Board of Trade members.
   Durkin spent Monday and two hours Tuesday morning giving opening
statements. He alleged the futures traders at the BOT regularly
bought and sold contracts outside the open market and set their own
prices to ensure a profit.
   ``Mr. Durkin threw out words like `ripoff' and `fraud' and
`cheating the customers,''' Lydon said. ``But remember, the
government must prove these things and prove them beyond a
reasonable doubt. Saying it doesn't make it so. Saying it for six
hours doesn't make it so.''
   Judge George M. Marovich is presiding over the third trial
stemming from a lengthy FBI probe of alleged corruption at the
world's two largest futures exchanges - the BOT and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   The soybean traders were among 18 traders and a clerk from the
BOT charged with violating trade regulations. The clerk and eight
traders have pleaded guilty.
   Durkin, one of three lawyers prosecuting the case, offered a
detailed explanation of how soybean futures are bought and sold on
the market during his opening statement. He also displayed enlarged
examples of documents used to conduct the transactions.
   But Lydon said the prosecutor's explanation of how business is
done at the exchange differed from reality.
   ``The government's version is a far cry from how it happens down
at the Chicago Board of Trade,'' said Lydon, who represents Edward
Cox III.
   Lydon said Durkin failed to tell jurors that prices can vary
during frenzied trading in the soybean futures pit, the area where
traders gather to trade publicly by shouting bids and orders.
   ``You people don't have to be expert traders to see that there
is likely to be trading at different prices, and there are likely
mistakes being made,'' Lydon told the jury.
   An undercover FBI agent who participated in the alleged illegal
trading is the prosecution's chief witness. At least five people
who have admitted guilt are expected to testify.
   The defendants are represented by separate counsel. All 10
attorneys will present arguments on behalf of their clients.
   The soybean traders are among 48 people indicted from the two
exchanges last fall. Twenty have avoided trial by pleading guilty
and one pleaded no contest.
   Trial for 14 Japanese yen traders at the Merc opened last week
before U.S. District Judge William T. Hart.
   In July, a jury convicted two Swiss franc traders from the Merc
of relatively minor trading violations and acquitted a third.
   The jury could not reach verdicts on scores of more serious
charges, including a racketeering count against one of the three
defendants. The men are to be tried again on those charges next
year.

<HEAD>Indicted Merc Traders Ignored Request To Avoid Customer Orders</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Commodities Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange says it is
monitoring indicted traders who ignored the exchange's request to
refrain from handling customer orders - but that is as far as the
Merc can go.
   Exchange spokesman Andrew Yemma acknowledged Tuesday that some
traders charged with defrauding customers have not complied with
the exchange's request that they trade only for their own accounts.
   He said the Merc has not ordered the indicted traders to stop
handling customer business because ``there is a presumption of
innocence until proven guilty.''
   ``You can't penalize somebody who has not pleaded guilty or been
found guilty,'' Yemma said.
   Ray Pace, one of 14 Merc traders currently standing trial on
federal fraud and racketeering charges, said in an interview Monday
that he and several other traders in the Merc's Japanese yen
futures pit have continued to fill customer orders despite the
exchange's request that they stop.
   The Chicago Board of Trade is not aware of any indicted traders
defying a similar request at that exchange, said spokesman Michael
O'Connell.
   Ten soybean futures traders from the BOT also are being tried,
in a separate courtroom, on racketeering and fraud charges stemming
from an FBI sting operation at the world's two largest commodity
exchanges.
   Pace said he initially complied with the Merc's request, which
was issued shortly after a federal grand jury handed down the
indictments in August 1989.
   He said he traded only for his own account for a few months but
resumed handling customer orders after learning that three or four
others who were indicted had not complied with the request.
   ``They never told you not to touch another customer order,''
Pace said. ```We're asking that you refrain from filling customer
orders' was the way they said it.''
   Pace said he never returned to executing the same volume of
customer orders as before he was indicted, which he estimated at
500 to 2,000 per day.
   Yemma said he did not know how many of the 26 indicted Merc
traders continued to handle customer orders after the exchange
asked them t stop.
   A total of 48 people were indicted as a result of the FBI's
undercover probe. Twenty pleaded guilty and one pleaded no contest.
   Yemma said that once a trader has pleaded guilty or been proven
guilty, the Merc's disciplinary process begins and the trader
generally is barred from all trading pending a hearing.
   In the first of the three trials stemming from the probe, a U.S.
District Court jury in July convicted two Swiss franc futures
traders from the Merc of relatively minor trading violations and
acquitted a third of similar charges.
   The jury deadlocked on scores of other charges, including a
racketeering charge against one of the defendants and mail and wire
fraud charges against all three.

<HEAD>Egypt Increases Oil Export Prices by $2 a Barrel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egypt has increased its oil export prices by
$2 a barrel for all blends effective Wednesday, an Oil Ministry
official said.
   This was the second increase in three days. On Monday, export
prices were raised by $3 a barrel for all blends.
   The official, who declined to be identified under Oil Ministry
rules, said that the new prices were $34.30 a barrel for the Khalig
el-Zeit and Ras el-Bihar blend; $34 a barrel for the Gulf of Suez;
$33.15 a barrel for Belayim; $32 a barrel for Ras Badran and $31.70
a barrel for Ras Ghareb.
   Wednesday's increase was decided by the interdepartmental
government committee charged with reviewing oil prices. It includes
officials from the oil, finance, foreign and other ministries.
   On Monday, Oil Minister Abdel-Hady Kandil did not even wait for
pricing committee members to assemble for a review and himself
ordered the $3 a barrel increase.
   Egypt previously reviewed export prices every two weeks but
changed the practice after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Since
then, the reviews have been made at shorter and irregular
intervals.
   Egypt produces 870,000 to 900,000 barrels of oil daily. It is
not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
It exports almost half of the output at prices that are set in
light of world market conditions and OPEC policies.

<HEAD>Nation Comes To A Standstill As 48-Hour General Strike Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 48-hour general strike by public and
private sector employees brought mass transit within Greece to a
virtual standstill Wednesday, in continued protests at the
conservative government's austerity measures.
   Nearly two million people, from postmen to actors, stayed away
across the country in the first 48-hour strike in 40 years called
by the General Confederation of Greek Workers, the country's
largest labor organization.
   This was the sixth general strike this year and the fourth since
the conservatives were elected in April to battle huge deficits and
a $100 billion public debt.
   Trains and buses stood still, but Olympic Airways, the national
carrier, suffered only slight delays and foreign airlines operated
normally, an Athens Airport spokesman said.
   In cities, residents fought for taxis or jammed into already
crowded streets with private automobiles because of the transport
strikes. In the capital, commuters clambered up ladders of heavy
military trucks ordered by the government to serve bus routes.
   Traffic lights were knocked out by power cuts, adding to the
chaos in the streets.
   Hospital personnel, school teachers and bank employees also
stayed away from work. State bank employees have been on strike for
13 days, seriously hampering foreign and domestic commerical
transactions.
   Following the bank employees, others began striking last week in
protest at the conservative government's cost-cutting policies and
its plan to overhaul state-run health and pension schemes.
   The week-long strike by Public Power Corporation employees
caused periodic blackouts throughout the country, with industries
stopping, people being trapped in elevators and food rotting in
refrigerators.
   Employees threaten to continue stoppages until the government
withdraws a bill that the government has presented to Parliament
for debate and a vote next week. The government has made some
concessions but has failed to satisfy the unions.
   The government wants to reduce the number of social insurance
funds, increase contributions by individuals, tighten eligibility
requirements and raise the pension age. It says that the state-run
pension funds owe about one trillion drachmas, or $6.7 billion.

<HEAD>Aquino Signs New Oil Tax Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino signed into
law Wednesday a bill cutting oil taxes by an average of nearly 50
percent to minimize the effects of an impending oil price increase.
   Budget Undersecretary Benjamin Diokno said the new law would
mean a loss in government revenue of 6 billion pesos, or $240
million, in 1991 and 1.5 billion pesos, or $60 million, this year
but would benefit consumers.
   Under the new law, taxes on premium gasoline, regular gasoline
and jet fuel were reduced by 30 percent. The biggest tax cuts were
for diesel oil, which was reduced by 60 percent. Taxes on kerosene
went down by 57 percent.
   The tax on liquefied petroleum gas, used by millions of
Filipinos for cooking, was scrapped.
   The tax revisions now pave the way for an expected increase in
fuel prices requested by the country's three oil companies.
Petroleum prices are government-controlled and have not risen
despite increases in crude prices brought about by the Gulf crisis.
   Finance Secretary Jesus Estanislao said last week that the
government cannot continue subsidizing fuel prices at current
rates.
   Labor unions have threatened nationwide work stoppages if prices
are increased, and the government appears reluctant to risk another
round of instability amid continuing threats by communist and
rightist rebels.

<HEAD>Users, Analysts Applaud New Models of Steve Jobs' Next</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATALINA ORTIZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Users of Next computers and industry
analysts welcomed new models of the sleek black cube, saying Steve
Jobs has eliminated most of the shortcomings that plagued what he
once called the ``best computer in the world.''
   ``I think it's revolutionary within the industry,'' Bill Edney,
a computer analyst at Los Alamos National Laboratory, said of the
new Next hardware and software unveiled Tuesday by Jobs.
   ``It's not that you can't buy these things on other computers.
The key to what Next has done ... is a vision of where things ought
to go,'' he said.
   Jobs, at the same symphony hall where he introduced the Next
machine two years ago, unveiled faster, more powerful and cheaper
versions of the computer and new applications software - all
intended to answer critics and boost disappointing sales.
   The new products also would make Next Computer Inc. an industry
leader this decade by linking individual users through
sophisticated networks of machines, he predicted.
   ``The mission of personal computers was to improve individual
productivity. It was largely achieved in the 1980s,'' Jobs said.
``What's going to happen in the first half of the 90s, we feel, is
interpersonal computing ... and we think we're going to be ahead
there.''
   Jobs, who co-founded Apple Computer Inc. and led the development
of Apple's Macintosh, introduced Next to a standing-room-only crowd
at Davies Symphony Hall in October 1988. He predicted it would
revolutionize the personal computer industry.
   The black machines won praise for their sharp graphics,
high-quality sound and NextStep - built-in software that makes it
easier to use the complex Unix operating system and write programs
for it.
   But Next users and other critics complained Next was too slow
and too expensive at $9,995 and lacked a floppy disk, color monitor
or adequate software. It was a year before shipments started, and
sales were slow - only about 7,000 machines were sold by June,
according to an estimate by International Data Corp.
   ``Well, we listened,'' Jobs said of the complaints.
   The new models are powered by Motorola's new 68040
microprocessor, at least three times faster than the 68030 chip
used in current models, Jobs said.
   The new Next sports floppy disks, built-in networking, color and
video monitors and a price ranging from $4,995 for an entry-level
computer with a black-and-white monitor to $13,999 for a
``best-of-breed'' color-and-video system. Floppy disks are
standard; the optical disks standard on earlier versions are an
option.
   Optical discs offer vastly more storage than floppy discs but
were criticized for being too slow.
   Shipments of the black-and-white products are expected in
November, and the others are planned for the first quarter of 1991.
More than 100 new software programs from a variety of companie are
promised by the end of the year - including Improv, a new financial
modeling program by Lotus Development Corp., famous for its 1-2-3
spreadsheet.
   Customers in turn have listened to Next, Jobs said. The company
received 15,000 orders for the new models during a two-month period
in which prospective customers tested prototypes, he said.
   ``If we can do that in 60 days - you can do the math,'' he
smiled. The orders exceeded his expectation, he said, but he would
not reveal that figure.
   Users and analysts who attended the presentation and product
fair said Jobs was moving in the right direction.
   ``I think from a technical point of view, in terms of product
features, he's overcome the great majority of objections,'' said
David Bayer, an analyst for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
   John Nguyen, an analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. Inc. in San Francisco,
was pleased with the number of new applications as well as the
hardware and Jobs' pricing strategy.
   ``There's quite a fair number of software packages available
today, and I think they have come a long way in addressing that
particular criticism,'' he said.

<HEAD>Group Says U.S. Petroleum Imports Rose in August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. petroleum imports rose 4.1 percent in
August compared with a year ago, a leading industry group said
today in the first comprehensive look at the nation's oil supplies
for the month in which Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   The invasion on Aug. 2 threw world oil markets into chaos and
fears of supply shortages sent crude prices skyrocketing.
   The American Petroleum Institute said in its monthly report that
imports of crude oil and petroleum products rose to 8.88 million
barrels per day in August compared with 8.53 million barrels a day
in August 1989.
   The August imports were down slightly from July imports, API
said.
   Analysts had said it would take more than a month for the trade
sanctions against Iraq to start having a real impact on the
nation's energy supplies.
   ``With shipping lags of a month or more from the Middle East,
shipments loaded before the Iraqi invasion continued to arrive
during August, with some scheduled to continue arriving through
September,'' API said. The government is allowing the Iraqi and
Kuwaiti crude to be delivered through Oct. 1.
   The nation's stockpile of crude oil and petroleum products was
up 2.9 percent from the previous August, at 1.1 billion barrels at
the end of the month, API said. That was about the same as July.
   But by the end of August, crude prices had risen by b70
percent and more than 100 percent above their levels in mid June,
API said.
   Analysts had said the actual effects of the boycott might not be
felt in the United States until mid- or late September, although
speculation about coming supply shortages has been enough to drive
up the price of crude, gasoline and heating oil. API, in its weekly
report, said late Tuesday that crude imports were down for the week
ending Sept. 14, helping to bring down the nation's stockpile of
crude oil.
   Deliveries of gasoline stayed at about the same level in August
compared with a year earlier, according to the monthly API report.
   Retail gasoline prices went up about 20 cents per gallon during
August, when compared with levels earlier in the summer, API said.
On an inflation-adjusted basis, that put pump prices about 20
percent higher than they have been over the past four years but
lower in real terms than they had been in the early 1980s, when oil
prices rose in the wake of the Iranian revolution.
   Deliveries of distillates, which include heating oil, were up
2.8 percent in August compared with August 1989.
   The nation's refineries were operating at 92.9 percent of
capacity in August, up 4 percent from the previous August. But
domestic crude production fell for August by 4.8 percent from a
year earlier, API said.

   The stock market declined slightly today as
hopes dimmed for any impending move by the Federal Reserve to
stimulate the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 3.72 to 2,567.57
in the first half hour of trading.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
424 up, 484 down and 476 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.40 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Stock prices staged a mild rally in late trading Tuesday amid
conjecture that the Federal Reserve might be ready to relax its
credit policy by seeking to foster a decline in interest rates.
   But such hopes seemed to get no support from comments this
morning by Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, before a
congressional committee.
   On the evidence to date, Greenspan said, ``we are not, at least
as yet, witnessing a cumulate unwinding of economic activity.'' He
also observed that the summer upsurge in oil prices had diminished
whatever chances existed for a break from persistent inflationary
pressures.
   Analysts generally interpreted those remarks to mean that the

   Baghdad today began confiscating the
assets of all countries participating in economic sanctions against
Iraq. The seizure order also applies to all companies based in
countries enforcing the sanctions.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said the ruling Revolutionary
Command Council ordered the seizure Tuesday night under a law
dealing with the protection of ``Iraqi interests, money and rights
in Iraq and abroad.''
   ``All assets - cash deposits, property, interest and other
revenue - belonging to the governments, institutions, companies and
banks of the countries that have joined oppressive resolutions
against Iraq are hereby confiscated,'' said the new law, the text
of which was carried by INA.
   The statement did not provide estimates for foreign assets in
Iraq, or say how much cash was involved.
   Four days after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the U.N.
Security Council imposed an embargo on trade with Iraq, choking off
Iraq's oil exports and blocking goods heading for the nation. Most
countries, including the United States, have followed the
sanctions.
   Iraq will also collect any interest accumulated by the sezied
assets, the agency reported in a dispatch monitored in Nicosia.
   The council, headed by President Saddam Hussein, is Iraq's
highest policy-making body. It is the only body that can override
Iraq's National Council, or parliament.
   The text made no mention of Kuwait, but earlier council
decisions have stated that Iraqi law applies to the emirate, which
Baghdad annexed six days after the invasion.
   The United States and Britain froze Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets
immediately after the invasion. Other countries, including all
European Community nations, quickly followed suit.
   President Bush said in a televised message to the Iraqi people
on Sunday that Saddam's invasion of Kuwait was going to cost the
nation an average of $20 billion a year in lost oil revenue.
   Iraq piled up a foreign debt of $60 billion to $70 billion,
about half of it owed to Arab states, during its eight-year war
against Iran which ended in 1988. Iraq has unilaterally canceled
its debt of about $10 billion to Kuwait.
   The rest of the money is owed to Japan, Italy, Britain, France
and the Soviet Union, most of for arms bought on credit during the
war.
   The new Iraqi law said foreign governments that froze Iraqi
assets after the invasion of Kuwait, ``are responsible for
safeguarding the cash and the assets and for protecting any revenue
coming from accumulating interest on investments.''
   Banks, it added, were ``fully responsible for protecting Iraqi
cash plus the interest, revenue and any other rights owed to
Iraq.''
   Iraqi companies, private and government, ``are not responsibile
in any way for losses resulting from any delay by foreign firms in
fulfilling contracts in Iraq. But these firms are held responsible
for for any damge inflicted on the Iraqi side.''
   Iraqi courts have also been ordered to reject any application
for any case against Iraqi firms - private or government - and
declared any ruling by foreign courts against Iraqi firms ``null
and void.''

<HEAD>GM Spends $4 Billion to Shut Plants</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs to include Chrysler comments.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is ready to spend more than
$4 billion over the next three years to shut unprofitable plants
without argument from the United Auto Workers.
   Under the three-year tentative contract the union's bargaining
council approved Tuesday, the world's largest automaker will make
the money available to assure workers will be paid in full if they
are laid off by plant closings.
   Analysts say GM will have to close at least four assembly plants
and lay off tens of thousands of people in an industry threatened
by a sluggish economy and foreign competition.
   The union made job security its top priority and said its
objective was reached in the agreement reached early Monday after
41 hours of non-stop talks. The contract covers 300,000 workers in
29 states.
   GM has closed four assembly plants in the last three years,
putting about 9,000 employees out of work.
   Under the latest pact, GM will pay dearly to close a plant. It
guarantees workers laid off for up to 36 weeks 95 percent of their
wages by supplementing their unemployment benefits. Anyone laid off
for more than 36 weeks will be guaranteed full pay for the duration
of the contract.
   The next step for the union is to get the contract ratified, a
process expected to take until the end of the month.
   The union would then bargain new contracts with Ford Motor Co.
and Chrysler Corp., where negotiations have been suspended since
Aug. 28 when the UAW concentrated on GM.
   In all, more than 450,000 active workers are covered by UAW
agreements with the Big Three automakers.
   The union probably would prefer to take the pattern to Ford
next, but that may depend on whether a Canadian Auto Workers strike
of Ford's operations there has been resolved. The strike enters its
fifth day today.
   The GM deal calls for a 3 percent pay increase in the first
year, lump sum payments of 3 percent in each of the next two years
and annual cost-of-living adjustments.
   But job security was a priority. The union's ranks have dropped
to 1 million from 1.5 million in 1979.
   Chrysler Motors Chairman Bennett Bidwell said today the company
and union may be able to reach an agreement similar to GM's without
a strike, but cautioned the health-care and job-security provisions
would be expensive.
   ``On the surface, it looks expensive. Job security is something
you can't legislate,'' he said.
   Chrysler repeatedly has called for lower health-care costs, but
Bidwell declined to say how stubborn the automaker would be in
talks on the issue. Reaching satisfactory health-care provisions
with the UAW would be ``excruciatingly difficult for us without
shattering the concept of pattern,'' he said.

   Ralston-Purina Co. has announced it will close
its pet food plant in Mechanicsburg, Pa., in late November or early
December, continuing a streamlining effort.
   The plant, one of eight Ralston pet food plants in the United
States, opened in 1970 and produces a complete line of dry foods
for dogs and cats. Production will be shifted to other pet food
plants, the company said Tuesday.
   The time of the closing will depend on production schedules,
company spokesman Patrick Farrell said.
   In recent years, Ralston has been able to streamline its pet
food division through improvements in plant operation efficiency
and now has more production capacity than needed, Farrell said.
   The Mechanicsburg plant employs about 160 people - 100 hourly
workers and 60 salaried employees.

rising fuel prices, resulting fare increases and intense

   Alaska Air went out on a limb earlier this month and announced a

offset rising fuel prices. The industry, which initially responded
with a 5.7 percent fare increase, has followed its lead.

   Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as fears of weekend frost
in the Midwest melted away.
   The soybean and corn markets were hit hardest by waves of heavy
selling that intensified near the close.
   Corn and soybean prices had rallied in the previous session
after some private forecasters predicted frost by Monday in the
Midwest, where those crops are concentrated.
   Analysts said Tuesday's rally also was stoked by rumors, which
proved unfounded, that the Agriculture Department had revised
recent soybean supply-and-demand statistics.
   ``They bought it for frost and for other things and none of
these things came to pass,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager of Balfour
Maclaine Corp.'s trading floor operations at the Board of Trade.
   ``They started selling it and the lower it went, the more
selling you brought in and what you ended up with was a debacle,''
he said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 4} cents to 6 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.69 a bushel; corn was 4
cents to 4} cents lower with December at $2.22 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 3 cents lower with December at $1.16 a bushel;
soybeans were 8{ cents to 15} cents lower with November at $6.17{ a

   Contracts for September deliveries of grains, soybeans, soybean
oil and soybean meal expired at noon CDT.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial adviser James Douglas Donahue had the
golden touch - and the track record to prove it.
   For about a decade, he made hundreds of clients happy by
grabbing double-digit returns through aggressive trading of stock
options, all the while promising to always hedge his bets.
   That's why many of his clients were shocked to learn last month
that Donahue had lost more than $100 million belonging to 1,500
investors in a limited partnership run by his company, Hedged
Investments Associates Inc. He had gambled big on UAL Inc. stock.
   Equally as surprising was the way they received that news:
through an 18-minute videotape broadcast during a meeting called by
Donahue at a Denver hotel, sans Donahue.
   ``Words aren't adequate to express my regret and sorrow over the
impact I've had on your lives,'' Donahue said in a choked, breaking
voice. ``I have affected your lives and my life. Many of you have
been my friends for 20 years and I feel terrible remorse for the
things I've done to you.''
   The investors ranged from the founders of Gates Rubber Co. and
Samsonite Co., both based in Denver, to retirees who entrusted
Donahue with their life savings.
   ``I suppose I should be just as angry as angry can be,'' said
Bert Johnson, a 58-year-old insurance broker from Evergreen, Colo.
``But I'm not at the point where I'm bitter as much as I'm just
frustrated. We don't know what went on. My guess is that he broke
his own rules.''
   Johnson declined to say how much he lost.
   As the investors try to uncover just out how Donahue lost their
money, Hedged-Investments, based in Englewood, has filed for
Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
claiming about $2 million of the $100 million remains.
   In addition, Hedged-Investments' subsidiary, Aeroturbine Energy
Corp. in California, has filed a petition for Chapter 11
reorganization.
   Donahue and his firm already have been named in at least four
lawsuits alleging he was negligent, breached his fiduciary
responsibility and failed to allow access to records.
   Attorneys and investors agree it could take more than a year
just to sort out the complex case.
   Donahue was known as an aggressive trader in stock options,
which are contracts to buy or sell stocks for a specified price in
the future. Aides say Donahue lived by two rules: Never take an
excessive position in any one stock and always hedge, a technique
to ensure potential losses are minimized.
   ``The thing that attracted not only me, but obviously bigger
hitters than I was, was the concept that this is a hedged fund
operation,'' client Johnson said. ``You cover all your options so
that it doesn't matter if the stock market goes up and down. You
have yourself covered in both directions. That was the major
selling point.''
   In the past several months, Donahue gambled that the stock of
UAL, United Airlines' parent, would rise. But a failed employee
buyout plan, coupled with the drop in stock prices after Iraq
invaded Kuwait caught him by surprise.
   He wasn't able to cover his position quickly enough, he has told
investors.
   ``He basically acknowledged he broke the promise that he'd
always hedge,'' said Chesley Culp III, a Denver attorney
representing several small investors. ``It's intentional
misrepresentation.''
   Attorney Harry Hobson, whose client Union Texas Petroleum
Corp.'s pension fund lost an estimated $8 million, said there was
no inkling that the firm was in trouble. The fund invested because
``it appeared at the time, I think, that he had a good earnings
record,'' he said.
   Robert Dill, Donahue's attorney, said investors were aware of
the risk involved. Nonetheless, he said Donahue was ``very
depressed and upset and concerned about the effect this had on many
friends and associates.''
   Donahue received a bachelor's degree in business from the
University of Denver in 1959 and earned a master's degree in
mathematics from Stanford University the following year.
   In July 1960, he joined the research department of Martin
Marietta Corp. in Denver as a statistician and computer systems
analyst. He became part owner in Falcon Research Development Co. in
May 1966, then joined the staff of Science Applications Inc., a
specialist in statistical and computer research, in 1974.
   Intrigued by the stock options trading industry, Donahue
developed and refined his own theory, which he detailed in a
newsletter called Options Strategies that was published from 1974
to 1976.
   In 1977, Donahue opened Hedged-Investments, using his computer
software program to assess stock risks.
   He kept the number of limited partners in each venture to fewer
than 100 to avoid registering with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. But some of the partners, like company retirement
funds, were comprised of 100 or more investors.
   Donahue's concept attracted investors of all financial
backgrounds, from retirees to Denver business leaders and pension
retirement funds, including Weyerhaeuser Co. of Tacoma, Wash.,
which lost $35 million in Hedged-Investments.
   As the years passed, Donahue reportedly earned 15 percent to 20
percent annually for his clients.
   ``He really was very impressive from the standing of seeming to
know what he was doing,'' said Johnson, who described Donahue as
friendly and intelligent. ``It's no secret that he was showing, for
approximately 10 years, fantastic returns on money that people were
investing with him.''
   Some investors said they were skeptical about the UAL-blamed
losses, noting that Donahue never provided them with the results of
a company audit. And as of June 30, Hedged-Investments had informed
clients that their investments still showed an increase, several
have said.
   Attorney Harvey Sender, who has been appointed trustee of the
Chapter 7 liquidation process, said the case is complex because of
the amount of money and documentation involved.
   Since the announcement was made late last month, Union Texas,
Weyerhauser, Paradigm Partners Inc. of Northbrook, Ill., H&amp;W Hedge
Fund of California and Denver-based Debt Investment Inc. have sued
Donahue, Hedged-Investments or Aeroturbine to recoup losses.
   Among the investors listed in documents filed in bankruptcy
court are: Charles Gates, owner of Gates Rubber; several members of
the Shwayder family, former owners of Samsonite; Dianne Ingels, a
former director of the failed Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan,
and Laurence DeMuth Jr., secretary and general counsel of U S West
Inc.
   Johnson said he knows several retirees who lost so much they
will be forced to return to work. But he notes, Donahue, too, is
suffering.
   ``He's a broken man himself. When all this stuff shakes out,
he'll lose everything he had,'' Johnson said. ``He might keep his
house, but his reputation is gone.''

<TEXT>
   As hammers and saws drone in the
background, George Varga spins his vision of how General Electric
Co. will boost its tiny Western European light bulb business by
leveraging the newly opened markets of the East.
   The beachhead is Tungsram, a collection of 12 light bulb plants
once owned by the Hungarian government. GE took control of Tungsram
in January for $150 million in the largest U.S. investment in that
nation since World War II.
   From an aged factory complex in Budapest, Varga is directing
GE's efforts to revitalize Tungsram and make it the hub of its
Europewide light bulb expansion efforts.
   For GE, a key attraction of Tungsram is its low-cost labor -
workers earn $2,000 to $3,000 a year on average. Varga says the
company can produce bulbs for the lowest cost of all major light
bulb makers.
   But for the longtime GE executive, the lure was more personal.
   Born in Hungary, Varga fled in 1956 when Soviet tanks rolled in.
Returning to run one of the nation's largest and best-known
companies has been a triumphal homecoming, said the 53-year-old
Stanford University graduate.
   ``This is a turn of events I never expected,'' he said in a
 markets after the communists took over, but 40 years of
state control left a bloated payroll and outdated plants run by
political appointees.
   However, Varga said he was pleasantly surprised when he arrived
in February at Tungram headquarters. ``By and large we expected
something worse than we got,'' he said.
   Both the condition of the machinery and the skill level of
Tungsram's 18,000 workers was better than anticipated.
   Varga also says some of the beliefs about workers in formerly
communist countries have not been borne out.
   ``People work,'' he said. ``One of the myths is the communist
worker is lazy. I'm amazed at how they hustle.''
   He believes the stereotype had its basis in the fact that many
plants in communist countries were chronically short of raw
materials, so there was little for the workers to do.
   But despite these promising signs, much hard work lies ahead for
Varga and his small crew of Western managers.
   Among the more pressing concerns is paring costs. Varga said he
wants to eliminate 2,500 jobs this year through attrition, and
about 2,000 more next year. That must be done without raising the
ire of the workers' union.
   At the same time, GE plans to spend at least $20 million this
year modernizing Tungsram's plants, and $30 million more over the
next four years.
   ``My private opinion is it will be a lot more,'' said Varga, who
has managed GE plants in several other nations, but never a light
bulb factory.
   Not all of Tunsgram is begging for an overhaul. On the top floor
of one of the factory buildings at the headquarters complex lies a
highly automated headlight assembly line installed by the Japanese.
The equipment pumps out top-quality bulbs that end up in Toyotas
and Nissans, Varga said.
   Varga also says Tungsram's incandescent bulbs are up to world
standards. They are sold throughout Europe and in the United States
at the IKEA housewares chain and other outlets, he said.
   But Tungsram is behind in making ``gas-discharge'' lamps, such
as fluorescent bulbs. Its fluoresent tube assembly lines need to be
altered because they break too much glass and waste raw material,
he said.
   Aside from trimming the payroll and updating plants, Varga said
he must break down the autocratic culture of Tunsgram under the
communists.
   ``Everything was done through rules, procedures and orders - no
questioning of this,'' he said.
   Varga said he has dispatched about 20 key Hungarian managers to
GE's U.S. plants for training in Western ways, and has sent about
50 others to a Western management course in Hungary.
   Varga also has taken to strolling through the plants to chat
with workers and let them know he's aware of their concerns. The
walks have startled employees used to distant communist factory
bosses, he said.
   On the other hand, workers are aware that ``if they don't do the
job I can fire them'' - something that was difficult for managers
to do under the communists.
   ``I'm sure that frightens them,'' he said.
   Varga said the attitude of employees about GE's plans has
changed from pessimism to skepticism.
   ``First they thought there were going to be massive layoffs,''
he said. ``Then they wondered whether we knew what we were doing.''
   A continuing source of friction with the workers is pay. The
union is pressing for raises that at least keep pace with Hungary's
rampant inflation, about 35 percent this year.
   Varga has raised wages about 20 percent so far this year. He
said he's told the workers that Tungsram can't afford any more.
   He also has instituted a merit pay system - anathema to the
communists. Under this, much of a worker's pay increase is based on
an evalutation by his supervisor.
   Varga said GE is under no illusion about what it will take to
modernize Tungsram. Though it was profitable when GE bought
control, the U.S. company doesn't believe it will recoup its
investments for some time and is more concerned with building
market share in the meantime.
   Aside from meeting GE's goals, Varga said he feels pressure to
become a model for turning around a former communist-run operation.
   ``This is more than just a job,'' he said. ``A lot of people are
watching this.''

<DATELINE>MUSTANG, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mustang Ranch, Nevada's oldest and most
infamous legal brothel, shut down after filing for bankruptcy
liquidation. A trustee says the U.S. government will try to operate
the business until it can be sold.
   A lawyer for owner Joe Conforte said Wednesday that Internal
Revenue Service harassment killed a $5 million deal to sell the
bordello - more than 100 bedrooms on a 440-acre ranch - and forced
it into liquidation in Federal Bankruptcy Court.
   Officials said Conforte owes $13 million in federal taxes.
Conforte has said the debt is no more than $7 million.
   The Mustang Ranch has frequently been in the headlines, as an
illegal operation, then the state's first legal bordello. One man
was killed on its premises; at least one wedding was held there.
   The bordello, 10 miles east of Reno, has been under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection since 1982. Under Chapter 11, a business is
allowed to operate under court supervision to pay off creditors;
under Chapter 7, its assets are liquidated and the proceeds
distributed among creditors.
   Two attempts to sell the business through public stock offerings
failed, including a $10 million offering last year.
   Prostitutes fled the scene after Tuesday's bankruptcy court
filing, out of fear the IRS was about to raid the place.
   ``Everybody just grabbed everything, called taxis and their
boyfriends and got out,'' said a woman who identified herself as
Sheila.
   On Wednesday, four women who had worked there returned to get
belongings and talk. They sat in red velvet chairs in the lobby and
complained about events - and about Conforte.
   One woman, who identified herself as Beth, said: ``Joe cleared
out the bar, the cashier, everything, and walked out with a bag of
money. Then somebody called and told us all to leave.''
   Assistant bankruptcy trustee Bill Knudson said the bankruptcy
court plans to supervise the business and ``watch the money.'' He
added, ``That's what our goal is, to keep it in operation until
they can sell it.''
   Knudson said plans to immediately reopen the brothel were
blocked by state health rules, which require any prostitute who
leaves the premises to be retested for sexually transmitted
diseases. That can take three days.
   Conforte attorney Pete Perry declined to name prospective
purchasers who had agreed to pay $5 million for the property in the
deal that fell through.
   ``We assured the IRS it wasn't Conforte but they wanted to
create problems and they did,'' Perry said. ``They want a
background investigation (of the buyers) and they have no right to
do that. It was an attempt to harass and intimidate the new
purchasers.''
   Ron Smith, chief of special procedures for the IRS in Nevada,
said he is required by the federal tax code to do a background
investigation in any case involving sale of a tax debtor's
properties.
   Conforte and his wife, Sally, began operations at the ranch in
the late 1950s when prostitution was tolerated but illegal in
Nevada. The operation was burned down in 1960 by local authorities
who contended it was a public nuisance.
   In 1971, Conforte won Storey County approval for the brothel,
pioneering the statewide movement to allow prostitution in most
Nevada counties. Now prostitution is allowed in 11 of Nevada's 14
rural counties, but forbidden in the counties where Reno, Las Vegas
and Carson City are located.
   Prostitutes rented their rooms at the ranch, which also got half
their earnings. They accepted credit cards, in advance.
   A prospectus for one of the unsuccessful attempts to sell stock
listed gross revenues for the brothel of $5.6 million in 1986, down
from $5.9 million the year before, but a 1986 profit of $917,000
compared with $848,000 in 1985.
   In 1976, heavyweight boxer Oscar Bonavena was shot to death at
the gates of the Mustang after he demanded to see Conforte. A
Conforte bodyguard, Willard Ross Brymer, served 18 months after
pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter.
   Conforte fled to Brazil in 1981 after being convicted of tax
evasion, but returned in December 1983 in a deal with prosecutors
to testify against U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne of Las
Vegas. Conforte claimed Claiborne took $85,000 in bribes.
   After a hung jury resulted in a mistrial, Justice Department
prosecutors dropped charges related to Conforte and won a
conviction against Clairborne.
   Claiborne was convicted of hiding more than $100,000 in income
from the IRS. He was later impeached.

<HEAD>Olympics Expected to Boost Atlanta's Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy may be sliding into a recession and
Atlanta's mid-1980s boom may be over, but economists say the 1996
Olympic Games will give the area an economic shot in the arm that
could last into the 21st century.
   ``Atlanta will be a pocket of prosperity in a dismal national
scene,'' said Jeffrey Rosensweig, an assistant professor of finance
at Emory University Business School.
   ``This could not have come at a better time. We had no other
engine for growth. This will be a catalytic event, restarting the
metro Atlanta economy.''
   The Olympics will have a $3.5 billion financial impact on metro
Atlanta, including $1.2 billion in direct spending by the Atlanta
Organizing Committee, said University of Georgia economist Jeffrey
M. Humphreys.
   Another $400 million is expected to be spent by visitors to the
area, and $1.9 billion in indirect spending is projected, said
Humphreys, who is director of the university's Economic Forecasting
Project.
   The Games are expected to generate 85,000 new jobs.
   ``If you're working for a construction firm, you'll obviously
feel the impact directly,'' Humphreys said. ``If you're not, you
will feel the impact indirectly, as people working for these firms
spend their money in your business.''
   Humphreys projects $9.6 million in direct spending by the AOC in
1990 and $18. million in 1991, mostly for architecture, planning
and consulting services. But as activity accelerates, from
construction of facilities to ticket sales and pre-Olympic cultural
events, the impact will soar to $278.7 million in 1994 and $453
million in 1996, he said.
   The money will come primarily from television revenues, ticket
sales and corporate sponsorships.
   ``It's a great shot in the arm,'' agreed Donald Ratajczak,
director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State
University. But he called the $3.5 billion economic impact a
``monkey number'' because the AOC study did not deduct the
undetermined amount of business displaced.
   Also downplaying the economic benefits to metro Atlanta Tuesday
was L. Phillip Humann, senior executive vice president of SunTrust
Banks Inc. Humann said the Olympics might not be the economic
bonanza that some initial reports predict, because those reports
estimate the Games' impact by assuming that hotels and restaurants
have no business without the Olympics.
   The area's sagging construction industry will be helped,
although competition to build the needed Olympic facilities will
come from all over the nation and the world, Humann said.
   A.W. Dahlberg, president and chief executive officer of Georgia
Power Co., said the exposure gained for metropolitan Atlanta by the
Olympics will trigger significant new investment in the area and,
therefore, new jobs.
   ``It's putting Atlanta on the international map,'' Dahlberg
said. ``This creates a whole new sense of where Atlanta is and what
we have to offer the world.''

<HEAD>Say Few U.S. Firms Affected By Iraqi Seizure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Few U.S. companies appear to be affected by
Iraq's seizure of assets from countries participating in an embargo
against it, experts and business people said Wednesday.
   Policies that restricted business dealings with non-Arabs appear
to have protected the handful of U.S. companies that have invested
in the Persian Gulf nation and neighboring Kuwait, which Iraq
occupied Aug. 2.
   Non-Arabs have not been allowed to own land in either Iraq or
Kuwait. Furthermore, non-Arabs may only hold minority positions in
joint ventures with either Iraqis or Kuwaitis, according to a U.S.
Commerce Department trade specialist who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Among the few major U.S. corporations with Iraqi ties is General
Motors Corp., which agreed last year to cooperate in building an
assembly plant with the capacity to produce 130,000 cars and trucks
in Iraq.
   GM Vice President John Rhame said ``the terms of the deal were
that GM provides only the transfer of technology and consultation
assistance. We had no financial interest (in the plant), no
investment, no equity - it was entirely their deal.''
   Rhame said a similar arrangement existed between the Iraqis and
the German automaker Daimler-Benz AG.
   GM hoped to benefit ultimately by shipping U.S.-made parts to
the plant, which was in the early stages of construction. But the
giant automaker was entirely unaffected when Iraq moved Wednesday
to seize the assets of all companies in countries enforcing
sanctions.
   David T. Mizrahi, editor of the New York-based newsletter
MidEast Report, estimated that U.S. assets in Iraq amount to ``a
few hundred million, certainly less than a billion dollars.''
   He noted that since the United States resumed diplomatic
relations with Iraq only five years ago, ``there hasn't been enough
time to build up a huge position in Iraq.''
   Texaco Inc. has no operations in Iraq, but the oil company does
own a refinery that pumps about 50,000 barrels of oil a day in
Kuwait near the Iraqi border. Texaco spokesman David Dickson said
that Texaco does not know the status of the refinery at this time,
but he added that it is ``not significant to Texaco's worldwide
operations.''
   Michael Saba, president of Gulfamerica, an Illinois-based
international business services firm, said there had been between
15 and 20 major American companies recently operating in Iraq.
   Saba, who travels frequently to the Middle East and left the
area a week after Iraq invaded Kuwait, said he had ``a significant
amount of money sunk into'' a conference that was to be held next
month in Bahrain. The conference, which Iraqi businessmen had
planned to attend, has been rescheduled for February and will be
held in the United States.
   PepsiCo International also had no assets in either Iraq or
Kuwait, though its soft drinks are sold there through franchises
with independent Arab bottlers, spokeswoman Anna Nerbovig said.
   Morrison Knudsen Corp., the Boise-based general contractor,
``was in the early business development stage and had a number of
potential manufacturing opportunities'' in Iraq, but virtually no
money invested there, said spokesman Jess Hawley.
   There are significantly more U.S. business ties to Kuwait, but
under similar terms, experts said. Major companies that have
transferred equipment to the Persian Gulf most likely have
insurance to cover its cost, they added.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Fall As Frost Fears Fade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade as fears of weekend frost in the Midwest
melted away.
   On other commodity markets, cotton futures soared; livestock and
meat futures were mixed; energy futures were mixed; and precious
metals fell.
   In Chicago, wheat futures settled 4 cents to 5 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.69\ a bushel; corn was
3} cents to 4{ cents lower with December at $2.22\ a bushel; oats
were 2 cents to 2} cents lower with December at $1.16\ a bushel;
soybeans were 9\ cents to 15} cents lower with November at $6.17} a
bushel.
   Contracts for September deliveries of grains, soybeans, soybean
oil and soybean meal expired at noon CDT.
   The soybean and corn markets were hit hardest by waves of heavy
selling that intensified near the close.
   Corn and soybean prices had rallied in the previous session
after some private forecasters predicted frost by Monday in the
Midwest, where those crops are concentrated.
   Analysts said Tuesday's rally also was stoked by rumors, which
proved unfounded, that the Agiculture Department had revised
recent soybean supply-and-demand statistics.
   ``They bought it for frost and for other things and none of
these things came to pass,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager of Balfour
Maclaine Corp.'s trading floor operations at the Board of Trade.
   ``They started selling it and the lower it went, the more
selling you brought in and what you ended up with was a debacle,''
he said.
   Tight-supply concerns helped boost cotton futures on the New
York Cotton Exchange, where the nearby October contract rose the
permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound.
   Ernest Simon, cotton specialist with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said the surge was prompted mainly by the relatively small
amount of cotton certified by the exchange as deliverable against
the October contract: 1,600 bales, with another 2,500 bales pending
certification.
   That amount compares with October delivery obligations of more
than 200,000 bales as of the end of Tuesday's session.
   Most of those obligations will be canceled by offsetting trades
prior to the delivery date, but Simon said cotton merchants will
seek to take delivery of all the cotton they can get because recent
rains in the Southeast have washed away expectations for an early
harvest of the new crop.
   Cotton settled .05 cent to 2 cents higher with October at 75.90
cents a pound.
   Livestock futures ended narrowly mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange ahead of a monthly government report that showed 5 percent
more cattle on feedlots as of Sept. 1 than on the same date a year
ago.
   Charles Leavitt, senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., predicted near-term live cattle futures would open as
much as .50 cent lower Thursday in reaction to the Agriculture
Department report.
   Leavitt said the feedlot total increased because relatively high
prices made feedlot operations profitable. He said more cattle were
available for placement on feedlots last month due to dry pasture
conditions in the Southern Plains.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent lower to .20 cent higher with
October at 79.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower
to .12 cent higher with September at 89.37 cents a pound; live hogs
were .25 cent lower to .35 cent higher with October at 53.82 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .38 cent to .45 cent lower with
February at 56.40 cents a pound.
   Crude oil and gasoline futures ended mixed while heating oil
futures rose sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid
continuing jitters over the war of nerves in the Persian Gulf.
   Light, sweet crude oil futures ended 41 cents lower to 30 cents
higher with October at $33.18 a barrel; heating oil was 1.34 cents
to 2.10 cents higher with October at 88.53 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.71 cents lower to .40 cent higher with October at
89.90 cents a gallon.
   Gold futures extended their recent losses on New York's
Commodity Exchange amid profit-taking from Monday's sharp gains.
   Gold settled $1.60 to $2.10 lower with September at $386 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.9 cents to 2.4 cents lower with September at
$4.769 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Time Warner Establishes Unit to Oversee Magazines, Books</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. said Wednesday it had
established a new publishing unit that will oversee both its book
and magazine divisions, and named magazine group boss Reginald K.
Brack Jr. to head it.
   The new unit will be called Time Warner Publishing Inc., and it
will oversee The Time Inc. Magazine Co., with about $2 billion in
revenue a year, and The Time Inc. Book Co., with more than $1
billion in annual revenue.
   Time Warner, which also has interests in films, television,
cable TV systems and recorded music, generates about $11 billion a
year in revenue.
   In a separate announcement Wednesday, Time Warner said its vice
chairman and general counsel, Martin D. Payson, will give up his
job as general counsel.
   Payson will devote full time to serve as vice chairman working
with Time Warner's co-chief executives Steven J. Ross and N.J.
Nicholas Jr.
   He will be replaced as general counsel by Peter R. Haje, senior
corporate partner with the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp;
Garrison.
   The consolidation of the book and magazine operations under the
new Time Warner Publishing unit will ``create a streamlined
reporting structure,'' according to co-chief executive Nicholas.
   ``Such an alliance is a natural one since a large part of bothcompanies
involves direct marketing in which both are leaders,'' he
said.
   Brack, 53, will be chairman of the new unit while retaining his
titles as chairman, president and chief executive of the magazine
company. Its titles include Time, Life, Sports Illustrated, People
and Fortune.
   Brack has headed the magazine operations since 1986 and
previously was chief executive of the book operations.
   Kelso Sutton, 51, remains as chairman and president of the book
company but will report to Brack.
   The book company includes Little, Brown; Warner Books; Time-Life
Books; and Book-of-the-Month Club.

   Russia's parliament Wednesday joined the growing
calls for Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov to resign,
blaming him for the nation's economic crisis and saying his reform
plan cannot rescue it.
   ``The people are living worse each year,'' said Ilya
Konstantinov, a lawmaker from Leningrad.
   ``It's obvious that the Ryzhkov government could not and cannot
correct the problem. It's also obvious that the Ryzhkov government
is opposed to adopting the radical program of economic reforms,''
he said.
   The Russian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, voted 154-4, with 18
abstentions to call for the resignation of the national Cabinet led
by Ryzhkov. As prime minister, he heads the Soviet government
bureaucracy that many accuse of impeding reforms.
   Legislators then went behind closed doors to draft a formal
resolution to be submitted to the republic's parliament and
adjourned for the day. Since Russia is only one of 15 Soviet
republics, the resolution would not be binding. However, the
expression of no-confidence is a major blow to Ryzhkov, who has
been under fire for months.
   The Russian action came three days after thousands of
demonstrators marched in Moscow and demanded Ryzhkov's resignation,
citing the failing economy. Many also called for Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to resign.
   Members of the Russian parliament, led by Russian President
Boris N. Yeltsin, said Wednesday they did not believe Ryzhkov would
carry out a proposed plan to create a market-based economy in 500
days.
   Yeltsin, who has previously called for Ryzhkov to step down,
left the session before the vote. An aide said later he was not
feeling well.
   The Russian parliament voted overwhelmingly last week to adopt
the 500-day plan. The national parliament is now considering
whether to aprove it or one of two other major proposals. Ryzhkov
presented his proposal, the most conservative, to the national body
last week.
   He has acknowledged publicly that his government will not be
able to implement the more radical, 500-day plan, and he indicated
he would resign if the national parliament voted for it.
   Several leading reformers have called for Ryzhkov's resignation
since he presented his plan, which envisions continued central
control of the economy while gradual moves are made toward a
market-based system.
   By contrast, the program adopted by the Russian parliament calls
for switching to a market economy within 500 days.
   The 500-day plan would return land to private farmers, sell
government enterprises to private stockholders and gradually remove
state-controlled prices on many goods. It would transfer most
economic authority from the central government to the 15 Soviet
republics, most of which are pushing for greater sovereignty or
independence.
   Gorbachev has backed a compromise plan that contains many
elements of the 500-day blueprint, but would move more slowly and
leave the central goverment with strong powers, including the
ability to levy taxes in the republics.
   Ryzhkov, 60, became prime minister in 1985, and he has often
been seen in public next to the Soviet leader.
   Ryzhkov is one of the architects of perestroika, the
restructuring program Gorbachev introduced, but Mikhail Malei, a
Moscow lawmaker, complained the prime minister has done a poor job.
   ``In his five years in power, the country has become poor. In
any other country in the world, in such conditions, the government
would resign,'' Malei said.
   Another Moscow lawmaker, Sergei Shakrai, said, ``The current
government is not capable of guaranteeing the sovereignty of Russia
... or pulling the country out of its economic crisis.''
   A delegate from the Siberian region of Yakutsk said the
parliament should not blame just Ryzhkov, but also Gorbachev for
the shortage-plagued economy. The Russian parliament did not go
along with the suggestion.
   Under Soviet law, the national parliament could call an
extraordinary meeting of its parent body, the Congress of Peoples
Deputies, which by a two-thirds vote has the right to force the
prime minister and his Cabinet out of office.

   The stock market turned downward Wednesday as
hopes waned for any impending moves by the Federal Reserve to
stimulate the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had eged up 7.18
points over the week's first two sessions, dropped 13.86 to
2,557.43.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
599 up, 883 down and 496 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 147.53 million
shares, against 141.13 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 176.38 million shares.
   The market staged a mild rally in late trading Tuesday amid
conjecture that the Federal Reserve might be ready to relax its
credit policy by seeking to foster a decline in interest rates.
   But such hopes seemed to get no support from comments Wednesday
morning by Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, before a
congressional committee.
   On the evidence to date, Greenspan said, ``we are not, at least
as yet, witnessing a cumulate unwinding of economic activity.'' He
also observed that the summer upsurge in oil prices had diminished
whatever chances existed for a break from persistent inflationary
pressures.
   Analysts interpreted those remarks to mean that the Fed did not
see much latitude at present for any significant easing of credit
conditions.
   Financial-services stocks suffered many of the day's most
notable losses, depressed by a variety of influences.
   American General fell 6&rsqb; to 33| on word that the company was
weighing restructuring plans as a possible alternative to finding a
buyer.
   MBIA tumbled 3&rsqb; to 28{, reflecting worries about municipal-bond
insurers as a result of the financial problems facing the city of
Philadelphia. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it reaffirmed its top

   Among the money-center banks, losers included Chase Manhattan,

{ at 17\.
   Merck, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 3&lsqb;

the potential market for a Merck prostate drug.
   Waste Management climbed { to 34| in active trading. The

   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
atively traded stocks, the market lost $13.97 billion, or 0.46
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 0.97 to 173.91.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.66 to 374.05, and

   Circle K Corp. on Wednesday reported a net loss
of $10.8 million for the three months ended July 31, compared with
a profit of $7.6 million for the same quarter last year.
   The Phoenix-based convenience store chain filed for protection
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code in
May. Included in last quarter's loss is $4 million for
reorganization expenses, the company said.
   Circle K said it cannot predict the outcome of the bankruptcy
proceedings.
   The company reported revenues for the quarter of nearly $970
million, compared with more than $1 billion for the same period
last year.
   Earnings per share dropped from 13 cents to a loss of 29 cents.
The company had 43.7 million million shares of stock at the end of
July, about 1.5 million fewer shares than at that time last year.
   Since filing for Chapter 11 protection, Circle K has closed
nearly 350 stores. It currently operates 4,280 stores.

<TEXT>
   Higher heating oil prices led an afternoon rally
in the oil futures market Wednesday after news of large stockpiles
of gasoline pushed early prices down.
   Light sweet crude, which had lost about $1 by midday, closed
down 23 cents at $33.18 per barrel for October contracts on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   Contracts for the next three months advanced as traders bought
later months and sold October crude, which has just one more day to
be traded.
   ``We're seeing some desertion of those October barrels,'' said
Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   Heating oil rose 2.10 cents to 88.53 cents for October delivery.
Analysts attributed the rise to seasonal demand, as well as some
buying by European traders.
   Unleaded gasoline fell 1.71 cents to 89.90 cents per gallon on
October contracts, falling also for the next three months but
rising for later months.
   Natural gas was down one-half cent to $1.555 per 1,000 cubic
feet for October delivery. Near months were also down a bit, with
distant months higher.
   The markets responded early to the American Petroleum
Institute's weekly report, issued Tuesday night, which showed
gasoline stocks up to 217 million barrels last week, from 211.1
million barrels a week earlier.
   Traders said market players were focusing more on supply and
demand factors, and less on headlines and rumors, than they have
during many sessions since the Persian Gulf crisis began.
   Late in the morning, API released the first comprehensive look
at the nation's oil supply for August, the month in which Iraq
invaded Kuwait. Most of the figures were within expected ranges.
   Despite fears of shortages caused by the subsequent embargo of
Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, U.S. petroleum imports rose 4.1 percent in
August, to 8.88 million barrels per day, compared with a year ago,
API said. The August imports were down slightly from July imports.
   Analysts had said it would take more than a month for the trade
sanctions against Iraq to start having a real impact on the
nation's energy supplies.
   ``With shipping lags of a month or more from the Middle East,
shipments loaded before the Iraqi invasion continued to arrive
during August, with some scheduled to continue arriving through
September,'' API said. The government is allowing the Iraqi and
Kuwaiti crude to be delivered through Oct. 1.
   The nation's stockpile of crude oil and petroleum products was
up 2.9 percent from the previous August, at 1.1 billion barrels at
the end of the month, API said. That was about the same as July.
   But by the end of August, crude prices had risen by between 70
percent and more than 100 percent above their levels in mid-June,
API said.
   The weekly API report released the night before showed crude
stocks down for last week.

   Top officials of Japan's Mitsubishi group of
companies and West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG announced Wednesday
they would establish a joint company in Japan to expand
distribution of Mercedes-Benz cars.
   The announcement was made after a meeting between executives of
the two giant industrial groups, which announced in March they
would forge global alliances in unspecified areas.
   At the meeting, the second in six months since they first met in
Singapore in March, the two companies agreed to further pursue
about 11 projects.
   Among them are global sourcing of materials and components;
information management systems and networks; cooperation in joint
design, development and production of vehicles; and strengthening
of the marketing structure of Mercedes-Benz cars in Japan.
   The officials expressed satisfaction at the progress of the
talks, but declined to provide details on the projects, saying it
will take time to work them out.
   Shinroku Morohashi, president of Mitsubishi Corp., a giant
trading house that forms the heart of the Mitsubishi group, told
reporters: ``These projects are large and not the kind that will
show rapid progress. We have to spend time on many of them.''
   He said the executives promised to meet again, probably next
spring.

   Most government bond prices gained Wednesday
after traders shrugged off disappointment that rising inflation
might delay a decline in interest rates.
   But short-term interest rates bobbed up due to diminished
expectations of an imminent ease in Federal Reserve monetary
policy.
   The market's benchmark issue, the 30-year Treasury bond, jumped
9-16 point, or about $5.57 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which
falls when the price rises, sank to 9 percent from 9.05 percent
late Tuesday.
   Remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan expressing
concern about ``new and substantial risks'' the Persian Gulf crisis
has piled on the faltering economy temporarily cast a pall over the
market, analysts said.
   ``It was another volatile session. The market was focusing on
what Chairman Greenspan had to say,'' said Kevin Flanagan, money
market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``He pretty much put
a wet blanket on the market.''
   Greenspan told the congressional Joint Economic Committee that
the jump in oil prices since Iraq seized Kuwait on Aug. 2 had
increased the threat of both higher inflation and a recession.
   He conceded that the oil price spike has made it difficult for
the central bank to carry out its mission of fostering
non-inflationary economic growth.
   Flanagan said the market initially reacted negatively to
Greenspan's comments, speculating that the central bank would
refrain from easing its monetary policy due to inflation concerns.
Lower rates benefit fixed-return investments such as bonds.
   In later trading, most bonds rebounded amid new indications of
economic problems and a drop in oil prices.
   A Fed report released Wednesday on conditions in various parts
of the country emphasized the weak economy. The report, known as
the ``beige book,'' said economic activity in the Fed's 12 regions
was either expanding more slowly or actually contracting.
   Oil prices posted declines, with the contract for October
delivery of light sweet crude closing at $33.18 a 42-gallon barrel,
off 23 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The October
unleaded gasoline contract lost 1.71 cents, settling at 89.89 cents
a gallon.
   In secondary market trading, prices of short-term government
securities edged down 1-16 point. Intermediate maturities finished
the session unchanged to up 3-16 point, while long-term issues
advanced { point to 9-16 point, according to Telerate Inc., a
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, added 1.41 to end at 1,142.58.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills remained at 7.64 percent as
the discount stayed at 7.37 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose
to 7.67 percent as the discount rose 2 basis points to 7.30
percent. Yields on one-year bills advanced to 7.75 percent as the
discount picked up 2 basis points to 7.25 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another
for overnight loans, was quoted at 7} percent compared with 7{
percent late Tuesday. The rate reached as high as 11 percent
Wednesday after touching down to 6\ percent on Tuesday in what
analysts described as technical fluctuations.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 3-32 point to 89 5-32 point. The
average yield to maturity increased to 7.70 percent from 7.69
percent late Tuesday.

   Cargill Inc. will open offices in
Moscow and Warsaw to pursue increased investment opportunities in
the Soviet Union and Poland, the international commodities giant
said Wednesday.
   Cargill has had trading relationships with the two countries for
more than 25 years, but has had no physical presence there.
   The Warsaw office is scheduled to open Oct. 1, followed by the
Moscow office in early 1991, the company said.
   Leonard Alderson, chairman of Cargill International, will
supervise the new offices. He said Cargill will check out
investment possibilities in five principal operating areas:
commodity merchandising, processing, agricultural products,
industrial products and transportation.
   Cargill's trading involvement with the Soviet Union has centered
on Soviet imports of grains, oil seeds and oil seed products from
around the world. In addition, Cargill has sold the Soviets frozen
concentrated orange juice, sugar, cotton, cocoa, coffee, malt and
rubber.
   Cargill also participates in the Soviet export of crude oil,
petroleum products and fertilizer, and purchases ocean-shipping
services from the Soviet Union.
   Cargill's commercial relationships with Poland include more than
25 years of grain and soybean meal sales and extensive chartering
of ocean vessels.
   Alderson said Cargill and Polish companies also have engaged in
large countertrade transactions that involved Polish imports such
as tea, lemons, meat, personal computers and videotapes.

   ``Europe is a key growth market for Harris,'' said Jon Cornell,
president of Harris' semiconductor sector. ``Having self-sufficient
local manufacturing will enable us to serve our growing European
customer base more efficiently and cost-effectively.''
   Under the first phase of the plan, which will cost $25 million,
Harris will build an assembly and testing operation at a plant that
is being expanded to 30,000 square feet. Close to 200 people will
be employed, the company said.
   In phase two, Harris will build a semiconductor wafer
fabrication plant on an adjacent site in the mid-1990s. The cost
will be about $200 million, and the work force will increase to
about 500 people.
   Harris Semiconductor, based in Melbourne, is the sixth largest
U.S. merchant manufacturer of semiconductors and the top supplier
to the U.S. government.
   Harris Corp. also is involved in defense electronics systems,
communications gear and office equipment.

   Atlanta developer John Portman moved a step
closer to a new project as news broke that his financially troubled
company plans to lay off about 10 percent of its work force.
   Seventy-five people will be laid off by the Portman Cos., some

range from executives to service employees.
   Portman, known for developing hotels and convention centers, has

   His company's work force, now concentrated in Atlanta, has been
declining since 1988, when it totaled 1,200 worldwide.
   The layoffs have ``nothing to do with the banks saying we have
got to streamline - it's just that the market is soft,'' Wolfe

   Also Tuesday, the Fort Lauderdale city commission chose

<TEXT>
   Housing starts fell 1.7 percent in August to
the lowest level since the last recession eight years ago, the
government said Wednesday.
   ``Although we're not technically at a recessionary level, I
would describe the industry as in a recession,'' said Martin
Regalia, an economist with the National Association of Savings
Institutions.
   ``Recession is a very technical term that gives very little
solace to an individual who has to live and breathe in a particular
market,'' he added.
   ``What they're really talking about are conditions that are
depressed in such a way that the industry clearly is in a major
decline,'' added economist Thomas Holloway of the Mortgage Bankers
Association.
   The industry has declined from a peak of 1.81 million starts in
1986 to an annual rate of 1.13 million in August, the Commerce
Department reported. That's the lowest level since 1.05 million
units got under way in August 1982.
   The August decline was the seventh consecutive monthly drop, the
first time that has occurred since May-November 1981.
   The last recession lasted from July 1981 to November 1982 and
slowed housing starts to a low of 1.06 million units in 1982.
   A recession generally is defined as two consecutive quarters of
decline in the gross national product. However, the official
designation comes from the Bureau of Economic Research which uses
additional economic data to determine when a recession begins and
ends.
   ``We're looking for further erosion (in housing starts) before
it's over,'' said David F. Seiders, chief economist for the
National Association of Home Builders, echoing projections of many
of his industry colleagues.
   Regalia said that while ``there will be no free fall, I expect
the numbers will drift down at this pace for a few more months to
the 1.05 (million) range, but I think that's where the bottom will
be.''
   Applications for building permits seemed to support a continuing
decline. Permits, which often are a barometer of future housing
activity, fell 4.3 percent in August to an annual rate of 1.08
million.
   Robert Sheehan, an economist with the National Apartment
Association, attributed the housing weakness to ``relatively high
long-term interest rates, a slowing general economy, waning
consumer confidence and the perceived further threat to inflation
and the economy from the military situation in the Middle East.''
   Construction of single-family units fell 3.2 percent to an
annual rate of 840,000 units in August following a 2.4 percent
decline a month earlier. It was the lowest number of single-family
starts since 737,000 got under way in October 1982, a month before
the last recession ended.
   Multi-family starts rose 2.9 percent to an annual rate of
287,000 after plunging 7.0 percent in July.
   The overall drop in starts was concentrated in the South where
they plummeted 10.7 percent to an annual rate of 441,000 units.
   Starts jumped 8.2 percent to 119,000 units in the Northeast, 4.9
percent to 234,000 units in the Midwest and 4.1 percent to 333,000
units in the West.

<HEAD>High Keating Bail Caught Even Prosecutors by Surprise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors in the criminal fraud case
against Charles H. Keating Jr. acknowledged Wednesday they were
stunned when a judge set bail at $5 million for Keating and $1
million for three co-defendants.
   For District Attorney Ira Reiner and his staff, the high bail
set Tuesday by Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner was more than
just a surprise, it was an embarrassment.
   In negotiating Keating's surrender, prosecutors had told the
defense the bail decision would rest with the judge. They had
indicated, though, that the amount would probably be far lower and
said they believed $1 million would be appropriate for Keating and
$50,000 for the others.
   ``When the judge set it at $5 million, we were probably as
surprised as Mr. Keating,'' said Mike Botula, a Reiner spokesman.
   Keating and the others remained in county jails in the first
criminal case stemming from the $2 billion collapse of Lincoln
Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif. They face up to 10 years in
prison each if convicted.
   Keating, an Arizona developer, is under investigation for
allegedly looting Lincoln. He headed Lincoln's parent company,
American Continental Corp. in Phoenix. The other defendants were
top officials of Lincoln and American Continental.
   A 42-count indictment accuses them of misrepresenting the safety
of American Continental junk bonds sold at Lincoln branches. All
told, more than 20,000 investors are believed to have lost $250
million on the securities.
   Most buyers were elderly. Many lost their life savings when
Lincoln was seized and American Continental wound up in bankruptcy
court, making the unsecured bonds virtually worthless.
   Sandi Gibbons, another Reiner aide, said discussions began with
defense lawyers soon after the sealed grand jury indictment was
handed up last week. During those talks, prosecutors agreed that $1
million bail would be appropriate for Keating and $50,000 for the
others, she said.
   However, the prosecutors agreed to make no bail recommendation
at Tuesday's hearing in return for the defendants appearing
voluntarily, lawyers for both sides said at that hearing. To the
surprise of everyone, Klausner set the far higher bail amounts.
   The defense received some help Wednesday from prosecutors, who
agreed to waive the normal five-day wait before a bail reduction
hearing. Accordingly, Klausner set the hearing for Thursday
morning.
   However, the judge indicated he felt the higher bail was
appropriate.
   Klausner said he was disappointed ``with the assumption by the
district attorney's office that if you get together (with the
defense) and agree what you want to do, that the court's going to
automatically accept it.''
   Reiner declined to be interviewed Wednesday. Ms. Gibbons said he
had known about the $1 million suggested bail for Keating and had
agreed to it. Nevertheless, he would not publicly ask the judge to
reduce the bail, she said.
   ``He agreed with the $1 million bail, and he also agrees with
the $5 million,'' Ms. Gibbons said.
   Keating, 66, of Paradise Valley, Ariz., became a prominent
symbol of the nation's savings and loan failures because of his
lavish personal habits, willingness to make risky investments using
taxpayer-insured money, and the estimated $2 billion cost of
bailing out Lincoln.
   His co-defendants in Los Angeles are Judy E. Wischer, 42, of
Paradise Valley, former president of American Continental; Ray C.
Fidel, 32, of Newport Beach, Calif., former president of Lincoln;
and Robin S. Symes, 37, of Malvern, Ohio, former chief executive
officer of Lincoln.
   Keating is also under criminal investigation by a federal grand
jury in connection with his alleged looting of Lincoln. He also
faces a slew of civil actions, including a $1.1 billion
racketeering case filed by the federal thrift bailout agency.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed
Chevron Corp.'s lawsuit that accused fellow oil giant Pennzoil Co.
of concealing its intentions when it bought 8.8 percent of
Chevron's stock.
   Chevron claimed Pennzoil was planning a takeover attempt or
forced restructuring of Chevron management when Pennzoil bought the
stock last November, using $2.1 billion from its $2.6 billion
settlement with Texaco over a Getty Oil Co. takeover fight.
   Pennzoil says it hopes to buy another 1.1 percent of Chevron
stock, leaving it just below a 10 percent limit set by the Chevron
board in newly adopted anti-takeover provisions. But the
Houston-based company said it intended only a long-term investment
in Chevron and a possible federal tax break.
   Chevron's suit, which sought to force Pennzoil to relinquish the
stock, was dismissed without a trial by U.S. District Judge Samuel
Conti. He said Chevron had failed to present evidence that Pennzoil
had hidden its intentions from investors or the Securities and

   ``If the investment were patently irrational as a long-term
investment, the court might be able to infer that Pennzoil had some
other, undisclosed purpose,'' Conti said in a 23-page ruling.
   He said Pennzoil had offered ``ample, unrefuted evidence'' that
the company had considered economic analyses showing that Chevron
stock was substantially undervalued and was a sound investment.
   ``We're disappointed with the outcome and we're looking at the
merits of an appeal,'' Chevron's chairman and chief executive
officer, Kenneth T. Derr, said in a statement.
   Chevron, based in San Francisco, is the nation's fourth-largest
oil company. Pennzoil is the 14th-largest.

<HEAD>Northwest Guarantees On-Time Arrivals in 18 Cities</HEAD>

   Northwest Airlines on Wednesday said it
would give members of its frequent flier program free tickets if
flights are more than 14 minutes late at 18 southern airports in
October.
   Homer Laird, area marketing manager, said service to the 18
cities is offered through Eagan-based Northwest's Memphis, Tenn.,
hub.
   Laird said that for the first half of 1990, 94.3 percent of
Northwest's flights have arrived on time at the 18 airports and he
expects that performance to be matched or bettered during the
October guarantee program.
   Northwest operates 67 arrivals each day at the 18 airports and
served more than 90,000 arriving passengers at the airports in
October 1989.
   The 18 airports are: Austin, Texas; Baton Rouge, La.;
Birmingham, Ala.; Chattanooga, Tenn.; Fort Walton Beach, Fla.;
Greenville-Spartanburg, S.C.; Gulfport-Biloxi, Miss.; Huntsville,
Ala.; Jackson, Miss.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Little Rock, Ark.; Mobile,
Ala.; New Orleans; Oklahoma City; San Antonio; Shreveport, La.;
Tulsa and Wichita, Kan.

<HEAD>Parent Company Considers Selling Acme Supermarkets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MALVERN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>

   American Stores Co. is considering selling
the 275-store Acme Markets grocery chain to pay off debt, the
company said.
   Selling Acme would allow American Stores to focus on ``food and
drug assets in other profitable and growing markets,'' the company
said.
   Malvern-based Acme operates in Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Delaware, Maryland, New York and Virginia and employs 25,000
people.
   ``While the chain is performing extremely well, the company
believes the sale of Acme Markets would be in the long-term
interests of American Stores and its shareholders,'' American
Stores chief executive officer J.L. Scott said Tuesday.
   Acme has a 38.2 percent market share in the eight-county
Philadelphia area, according to Food Trade News. Pathmark, at 10.2
percent, and Super Fresh, at 9.8 percent, are its closest rivals.
   Acme made a profit of $97.1 million on sales of $3.3 billion
last year.
   No buyers have been found, but American Stores spokesman Troy
D'Ambrosio said the company would consider an offer from its
workers.
   American Stores is the nation's largest food and drug retailer
with 1,900 stores in 38 states. It took on a hevy debt burden when
it bought the 340-store Lucky chain in 1988.

<HEAD>Computer Retailer To Lay Off 11 Percent Of Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially troubled Businessland Inc.
said Wednesday it would lay off 370 employees, or 11 percent of its
work force.
   The computer retailer, which lost $23 million in fiscal 1990 on
sales of $1.35 billion, announced other cost-cutting measures,
including consolidating operations and cutting product inventories.
   ``We're making the tough decisions and we're continuing to
evaluate all parts of our business to bring our operating costs in
line with revenue,'' said David A. Norman, Businessland's chairman,
president and chief executive officer.
   The layoffs would result in a $1 million charge for the current
quarter ending Sept. 30, and analysts said prospects for the coming
year was poor. Businessland has 3,300 employees throughout the
world.
   Businessland's other cost-cutting measures include merging
ComputerCraft retail operations into the corporation and turning
all ComputerCraft stores into Businessland outlets. ComputerCraft,
a Texas retailer Businessland acquired two years ago, has been
losing money.
   In addition, Businessland said it would cut worldwide product
inventories by $50 million and appoint a senior vice president of
sales and marketing to centralize sales groups.
   The layoffs would save the company $12 million and cutting
inventories would save $5 million during the coming year.
   Businessland is still feeling the effect of its feud with Compaq
Computer Corp. last year, analysts said. Compaq pulled its machines
from Businessland stores, but Businessland recently resumed
carrying Compaq's products.
